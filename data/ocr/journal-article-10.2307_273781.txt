<plain_text><page sequence="1">By ARTHUR C. BANKS, JR. and FINLEY C. CAMPBELL The Vision of the Negro in the Kazantzakian Universe T IS SAID that all scientists and artists seek to measure out of the chaos of impulse, emotion and phenomena an orderly system, an orderly construct which forms their universe. This universe is not real in the objective sense; it is a construct of location, identification and meaning. For the scientist, this process involves measuring, limiting and defining, and the creation of certain workable and credible but theoreti- cal norms such as, for example, matter, energy, time, and space. For the poet, this process involves the expert use of language and linguistic constructions designed to convey structured ideas and meanings full of universal insights. These processes are expressions of aesthetic creativity and, perhaps, form an area of community between poet, scientist, econo- mist, dramatist, writer and political scientist. Often the end product of this creativity or these creative impulses is the projection of field theories, such as the Heisenbergian hypothesis in physics or the tragic vision in poetry and epic literature. The great Greek writer, Nikos Kazantzakis, who left this earth only a short time ago, had such a vision. In his monumental effort, The Odyssey: A Mod- ern Sequel, in his tender, nobly human and sublime The Last Tempta- tion of Christ, and in his novel of vast proportions, The Greek Passion, this tragic vision is present, weaving in and out of the plots and characters like a dark, raw thread. Poetically stated, the tragic vision of Kazantzakis presents the figure and image of man as a dark, obscure thing, a part of and in conflict with, among other things, God, the Flesh, and the Devil. To man, and to man alone, is given the task of weaving out of this complex some permanent fabric which simultaneously will contain him in time, and yet release him for eternity. The tension produced by this task, by this conflict, is unrelieved in the human con- dition, although it can be, and often is, masked by the sullen and ex- hilarating demands of the flesh. This is a rough outline of the tragic vision of Nikos Kazantzakis-a vision with a tension, existential if you will, or essential if you prefer, between the old Christian-Platonic dichotomy of the body and the soul, or, psychoanalytically, between the id and the superego. In turn, this tension between mortality and the eternal promise of immortality 254</page><page sequence="2">THE NEGRO IN THE KAZANTZAKIAN UNIVERSE forms that multi-level construct which is man's humanity. Within this complex of ideas, we believe, lies the image of the Negro, which image is one of the central symbols of the Kazantzakian universe. Before attempting to move into the ambiguous world of symbolic complexity, it becomes necessary that we set forth some elements of this universe. First, there is a God, but not the self-contained ontos of Greek-Roman derivations, nor the Jehovah philanthropos contradiction of Christian theology. In the Kazantzakian universe, God is a tran- scendental creative force moving toward ontology through the subtle powers locked deeply within phenomenal experience (as distinct from ab- solute omnipotence). God is also moving toward a kind of higher love and compassion for his universe; he is seeking a God-like emotional un- derstanding of the creations of his own emotion-man and his uni- verse. Power and love are not in opposition but in apposition in this universe. Love is the motive for creation, power within the phenomenal world is the means, and the liberation from Becoming into Being is the end of creation. The conscious element in all this, the conscious, reflective, reacting element is the mind of mind that serves the reflective purposes of God and the mortal purposes of man. This mind, the product of a hundred billion years of God's power, i.e., evolution, is still incomplete. Heavy and dark with impulses which dissipate it, with perceptions which flaw it, with emotions which dull it, this mind tries to move out of the in- choateness of matter toward knowledge in the Greek sense of sophia, which is complete wisdom. The mind has a kind of knowledge, i.e., intelligence, intellect, but it is a flawed instrument which stumbles in and out of truth, rather than following consistently the Ariadnean thread of Godness through the labyrinth of man's humanness. In a word, the mind is trapped in the flesh. Only in the trans-natural process toward ultimate spiritual freedom, far down the corridors of biological and psychological evolution, can the mind, like a white gull freed from a storm, bring God and Man out of the painful process of Becoming into the fulfillment of Being. Thus man, haunted by the vast nightmare of his past, wrestling with his present fate of being both inside and yet out- side of God, and dreaming of a tensionless future, struggles, fails, and struggles toward his doom. In Greek tragedy, man consciously or unknowingly struggles against the gods. Though the struggle is intense and the conflict is severe, the end is foreordained. The defeat of Oedipus is as inevitable as it is terri- ble. His hubris is transformed to sophia. He is blinded, polluted, ostra- cized, shorn of fortune, power, and comfort. But he finally knows. He is brought closer to the awesome chasm which separates gods from men. In Shakespearean tragedy, also, sophia is the goal but in another sense. There is also conflict but now it is between one man and another man 255</page><page sequence="3">PHYLON -so it seems. In reality, it is within the hero himself, between the con- fused vision of appearance which is his humanity and the necessity of reality, which is his moral environment. The conflict between men mere- ly sows the seeds and opens up the real conflict within the Shake- spearean hero. Hence, in the fog of appearances, Lear founders upon the shoals of reality and dies. Indeed, the Shakespearean tragedy always leads to the death of the hero. Death is the price of sophia and, in a Greek sense, it is a waste. The counsels the hero could have given to his fellowmen stop with his heart. Nevertheless, he is consoled by the fact that he has become aware of what is real and what is illusory. He is brought to knowledge, though he can never use it. With Kazantzakis the tragic vision involves these elements in different combinations. God, sophia, and the hero do meet. But not in the arena of the flesh. Man struggles in conjunction with God to bring forth mind, or more pre- cisely, spirit. However, the individual man is defeated and brought to disaster by the omnipresent flesh. But not quite. The flesh brings man to the point of an ultimate crisis: it yawns and beckons as a final solace and escape from the tragic ten- sions mentioned earlier. These tensions are now polarized; they are ten- sions between human passion and God's power, between the unknow- ingness of innocence and the terrors of knowledge, between the tran- scendence of love and omnipresence of lust. In this context, the flesh mangles the hero, takes his life, gnaws at him until death, but does not defeat Him, i.e., the God in man. The hero dares to use this crisis, this last temptation, as the final gesture of defiance against the world- prison. In the main works of Kazantzakis the symbols of the flesh vary. In The Greek Passion, the symbols of sensuality are contained in the char- acters of the Turk overlord and Katrine, the village Magdalene. In The Last Temptation of Christ and in The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, it is the Negro. For Kazantzakis, the image of the Negro operates on two levels, one major and one minor. On the minor level, there are the usual mixtures of myths and truths which may be labelled as the institutionalized prejudices and biases typical of our civilization. One of these myths cen- ters around the so-called amazing sensual and sexual capacity of the Negro. In the European literary mind (Conrad's Heart of Darkness comes immediately to mind), the Negro evokes visions of the atavistic sensuality which Carl Jung has centered in the so-called primeval un- consciousness, and which Sigmund Freud has centered in the libidinal darkness of the Id. Indeed, the Negro image in the European psyche rep- resents a paganism more pagan than the most heathenish rites of the Caucasian world. 256</page><page sequence="4">THE NEGRO IN THE KAZANTZAKIAN UNIVERSE In the universe of Nikos Kazantzakis, however, the Negro operates simultaneously on a second and more universal level. The Negro "acts out" Kazantzakis' ideas about the never-ceasing struggle between mor- tality and immortality. Moreover, he is symbolic of the movement in a grand design of universal action. He is not only the sordid purveyor of passionate sensualism; he is also a dynamic force, the action of the flesh both as a contrast to and a complement of the action of the spirit. The Negro projects the paradoxical ambivalence of flesh and spirit. He acts out in metaphoric intensity Kazantzakis' neo-Augustinian paradox of the flesh. Indeed, this is the paradox explicit in the most orthodox of Christian dogmas: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." For in the Symbol of the Eucharist, for example, the Son becomes both spirit and flesh. There is a difference, however. In the vision of Kazantzakis, the flesh and its symbol, the Negro, have no original pollution. The flesh is good and not evil; it is innocent, though it is the source of passion; it is the humanity of man, being the source of all his emotions. Further- more, without the dynamics of sensuality, that complex of passion and emotion, there can be no evolution, there can be no mankind, and the power of God is curbed. Yet the flesh is the obstacle to freedom, and to Being. It blurs and distracts the movement which God is making toward self-knowledge, and which man is making toward sophia, God- knowledge. Now, how is this related to tragedy? To the man, the non-hero, who submits to the solace of the flesh, there is no tragedy, since there is no tension and no dialectic of choice. But to the man acting as Hero, there is tragedy. For, though he must submit to the demands of the flesh, it cannot console him. Now there is tension; now there is the dialectic of choice. For him, the flesh-spirit paradox is most wracking. He must go through the flesh to find God. And at one of the key stations in this process stands the Negro. In The Last Temptation of Christ, before Jesus can die, He must be tempted by the Negro angel-devil. This occurs in one of the most compli- cated portions of this strange, exquisite retelling of the Christus myth. As Christ is dying on the cross, He is caught in a vision in which He does not die. Instead, His crucifixion is a dream sent to Him by God. In this vision, acting as His constant companion in His uncrucified life, is a little black angel. He appears to Jesus in the following vision: "What warm beauty, what soft, curly fluff on his cheeks . . . And the eyes- how they played friskily, full of passion, like those of a young man or woman in love. . . and his armpits smelled of beloved human sweat." 1 This is the evocativeness of the angel on first appearance and it is 1Nikos Kazantzakis, The Last Temptation of Christ, tr. P. A. Bien (New York, 1961), pp. 436-37. Hereinafter quoted as Last Temptation. 257</page><page sequence="5">PHYLON irrelevant to note the various concrete details which symbolize the flesh. But more than this he is Christ's guardian angel and the first thing he does is to encourage Christ to make love with Magdalene. Again we see the image of the sensual. This angel, His guardian, tells Him, "I'm afraid to have you all alone and undefended-so I'll come with you. I'll turn myself into a Negro boy . . . I don't want you to take the wrong road and get lost." 2Now, at this moment, that which had been unfolding throughout the story-the last temptation-takes its symbolic representation as a Negro. All of the meaning and myths of the Negro are brought to bear upon this transformation. Thus when Jesus becomes involved in the net of conjugal eroticism woven by Mary and Martha, His two wives in this vision, the small Negro watches the seduction "from between his long eye-lashes... and a sly contented smile spread across his face." 3 As Jesus becomes more and more interwoven in the flesh, that same flesh which He struggled to break through on His way to the spirit, that same flesh which is the bridge to Being and not the end of Being, the Negro subtly guides the entrapment, playing a shepherd's pipe as a dark and luxurious counterpoint to this struggle. He personifies the rich, impulsive, emotional life of the flesh. At one point the dark angel- tempter says, "Out in my homeland, Ethiopia, . . . we discuss our de- sires honestly, openly, and act on them. . . . And if I want to kiss a woman, I kiss her. And our God doesn't scold us either. He's black and ... He does whatever he pleases." 4 And it seems that Jesus has surrendered to the wiles of His dark companion. At another place the black angel-devil exclaims to Him: "Alone you cannot find God. Two persons are needed, a man and a woman. You didn't know that-I taught it to you; and thus after so many years of seeking God, you found him-when you joined Mary." Jesus concurs and adds: "That is the meaning of God, that is the meaning of man. This is the road." 5 A bit further on Jesus asks if His little black tempter will be with Him for all eternity. To make sure that Jesus understands the existential bounds of the reality of matter, the angel bangs his fist upon the ground and says: "Here is the kingdom of heaven: earth. Here is God: your Son. Here is eternity: each moment, Jesus of Nazareth, each moment that passes." 6 Thus the iconic representation becomes clear. The Ne- gro tempter-angel would fix or freeze on the staircase of Becoming one moment of it and call it Being! It is Paul, who comes to visit the uncrucified Jesus, who shifts the 2 Ibid., p. 451.

Paul knows there is no solace in the flesh. But it is Judas who breaks the power of the Negro angel who in reality was the devil: Satan. The black angel-tempter was Satan who, when Christ had fainted on the cross, had tried, at that last moment, to tempt Christ into a total acceptance of the teleology of the sensual life. The Negro angel dissolves into a mocking laugh outlined briefly by white teeth and golden earrings. Christ is back on the cross after resisting this final temptation-now more fit and more deserving to fulfill His great destiny. In that great masterpiece of our time, The Odyssey: A Modern Se- quel, Kazantzakis again calls upon the symbolic Negro to propel and power the universal man, Odysseus, toward his noble rendezvous with the Spirit. Homer's Odyssey ends with the victory of the hero over the suitors who had laid siege to his home and the faithful Penelope's hand in his absence. However, home and hearth hold no lasting charm and interest for the restless Odysseus. In the modern sequel by Kazantzakis, he buries his aged father, Laertes, quarrels with his son, Telemachus, and finally decides to leave Ithaca forever. He goes to Sparta and ab- ducts Helen, who is bored by home and her old, soft husband, Menelaus, and sets out on a new "Odyssey." From this point on, the image of the Negro appears throughout this modern classic as a guidepost or sign of the progress of Odysseus through the flesh and up the staircase toward the spirit. The image of the Negro is a more deliberately built-in symbol in The Odyssey than in The Last Temptation of Christ. After leaving Sparta with Helen and with his crew of men as rest- less and homeless as himself, Odysseus sails for Crete. In the descrip- tion of the sensuality and decadence of the Cretans, their island is described as "many-breasted, shameless and nude. .. ."7 Cretan mer- chant captains on foreign shores are recalled by Odysseus as men who "drained their bodies dry with lust,. .. swooned in the firm embrace of their black slaves." 8 When we meet Diktena, the lustful high priestess of the island, her identification with the sensual is precise. To emphasize this point we are told by a gossiping Cretan, referring to her three Negro bodyguards, that "our good-natured princess cries in bed with these three blacks the whole night through." 9 In Kazantzakis' The Odyssey, Crete, along with Egypt, represents the purely mud-brained kind of sensual existence and in the scenes depicting sensual power and sensual excess, we see the first stage of man's evolution-the flesh in all its glory covering and blotting out all of man's aspirations. Odysseus him- self participates in the obscene, atavistic rites of the Cretans. But unlike them, he is not content with the orgiastic celebrations. He fi- 7Nikos Kazantzakis, The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, tr. Kimon Friar (New York, 1958), p. 143.

Needless to say, they too are massacred. More decadence is witnessed by Odysseus in Egypt and he flees that lahd and heads south toward the source of the Nile. He decides to build the kingdom of God here on earth, to build a city of Virtue popu- lated by Heroes south of Egypt in the wide expanses of Africa. Again the image and symbol of the Negro appear. Before they enter this land, however, his spirit-fatigued cohorts must revel with dark Ethiopians in Dionysian abandon. One of Odysseus' most trusted lieutenants, Rocky, must become the leader of a tribe of black men;10 Orpheus, the artist, becomes their Priest. Another follower, Kentaur, is wed to the fat, black daughter of an African chief. Again the vision of the sensual glories of the flesh is evoked in the wedding dance of the Africans: "The orgiastic dancers ground their bellies, shrieked with gleaming teeth then fell into the aroused men's arms." 1 We must emphasize here that Kazantzakis makes no separation or distinction based upon race between the atavism of the Africans and that of Odysseus and his followers. Odysseus distinctly feels himself stirred by the swelling glory of Eros, but he "spoke to that still sleep- less forge, his lucid mind" and calls forth his will and said, "Ah, master craftsman, now let's see what you can do: fetch up the sperm from the roused loins to the clear head and make it soul." 12 But the rest of Odysseus' troop is not so strong. The all-powerful flesh exerts its furi- ous demands and soon his friends "lay on Negroid breasts in a dark daze." 13 With the remnants of his band that could be rescued out of the lust and treachery of the African tribes, Odysseus moves on to build the City of Heroes and Virtue. But we note that it is built in the heart of sensuous Africa. It is in this heart of Africa that he, the wanderer, discovers the truth that God perhaps is not a protective, almighty deity. God is no weaker or stronger than man; and, like man, He is moving toward some unknown end through the tragic necessity of life, through evolution, through the paradoxes of pain and pleasure which wrack the flesh and thwart the spirit. Only two escapes are possible: fight through the flesh to the spirit, or a fall back into the flesh, seek- ing protection from pain and its brother, uncertainty. The City is destroyed by an earthquake, but Odysseus remains in Africa and becomes a great ascetic who now dreams no more of a world without suffering. But even on this level of Becoming, Temptation 10 Ibid., p. 392. 11 Ibid., p. 379. 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid., p. 381. 260</page><page sequence="8">THE NEGRO IN THE KAZANTZAKIAN UNIVERSE comes again. Again the form and symbol of this new trial is the Negro- a snake-like, naked Negro boy who laughs at Odysseus' efforts and mocks his asceticism: "Alas, your flesh is leprous now, your body is bone, your shanks are cricket-thin .. ." 14 Once again visions of the flesh, the warm, safe, sensual existence, tempt him and make the noble Odys- seus ashamed. Most important, he foresees more temptation; he will meet the Negro boy again. The final result of this adventure of Odysseus into Africa is the re- jection of an anthropomorphic God, and the acceptance of a transcenden- tal God, a force, now symbolized by death. The end of life, he sees, is not a purified God. It is more; it is Freedom from all gods, Freedom which is the end of the God-force in the universe. The complement of the God-force in phenomena is the Id in man. It goes beyond the ques- tion of whether the Flesh can make or assist the Mind or whether the Mind makes the Flesh. Only this is true: out of the chaos of the Flesh comes the cosmos of the Mind. Odysseus continues toward the southern tip of Africa-symbolically going deeper into life. The Negro symbols and images now dominate; he sees the burial of a black chieftain;'5 he is fed by a passing Negress, and, once more, temptation appears in the shape of a Negro boy. The boy tells Odysseus that he can now stop searching and groping out of the flesh, for he has now become the perfect man.16 This is the tempta- tion of success, of hope, of fulfillment but Odysseus is not fooled. He knows that success and hope are temptations in themselves. He knows that the Flesh lurks behind these illusions. To the Tempter he replies, "my mind has climbed earth's highest peak and knows this truth: 'I am the savior, and no salvation on earth exists.'" Then Ka- zantzakis adds the punch line: "The warrior, stripped of all hope now, smiled on his mind." 17 Now as Odysseus nears the end of his journey he meets the symbol of the flesh three times: first, in the form of a Negro girl who repre- sents the last time that he will touch a woman. He has come to grips with the flesh, this Wanderer-Ascetic, and his mind says, "Let this be the last fondling of a woman's flesh." 18 Then he meets a Negro fisher- lad, a sort of Christ-like figure who is concerned with the soul of man. To Odysseus, now wiser than any man, now more human than men and mankind, now full of real love for man and God, this image is also a temptation, another facet of the temptation of Hope. Once again the Suitor-slayer declares, "That man is free who strives on earth without one hope!" 19 Odysseus will not allow this temptation of the hope-for- 14 Ibid., pp. 506-07. 15 Ibid., p. 553. 16 Ibid., pp. 560-61. 17 Ibid., p. 562. 18 Ibid., p. 655. 19 Ibid., p. 6. 261</page><page sequence="9">PHYLON soul to blot out his belief in and love of man, all of man, his mind, his flesh, and his Soul, which must purify itself in that very Flesh. Odysseus refuses to be tempted to separate the mind out of the flesh and says to the gentle black tempter, "You love that giddy golden finch, the soul of man . . . but I love man's sad flesh, his mind, his stench, his teeth... . 20 After this Odysseus heads for the South Pole. He has passed through the flesh, neither scorning it, nor being trapped by it. It is the bridge to the liberation that awaits him at the South Pole. However, before he dies, the last thing he sees is a "warm soft body . . . crouched beside his feet . . . a curly-haired, sly Negro boy . . .," the temptation again. The two "talked in silence again" as they play with all of life again.21 By now, however, the flesh has served its purpose. Odysseus fondles the little Negro boy, Temptation, and even this act of love melts away his flesh, revealing nothing but a "cold skull [that] glittered bald and smooth in the afterglow." 22 Then he hangs the Negro boy on the "mid- mast [of his ship] as scarecrow for the lower world." 23 Odysseus now moves into death. He has overcome the world. To the very end of this great book, the symbol of the Negro has been a key, nay, a central symbol, in the Kazantzakian universal drama as played out by the hero, Odysseus. In the hand of this Greek writer the symbol of the Ne- gro or, if you please, the Negro's symbolic nature goes beyond mere racial prejudice, beyond the Negro's function merely as a symbol of certain sociological and political problems-beyond environmental negri- tude, in a word, to a point where the Negro takes his symbolic place and nature in the universe as a whole. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid., p. 774. 22 Ibid., p. 775. 23 Ibid. 262</page></plain_text>
