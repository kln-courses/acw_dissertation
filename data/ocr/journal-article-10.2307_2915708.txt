<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND EZEKIEL The general likeness of Lycidas 113-131 and Ezekiel XxxIV, 2-10 has not been sufficiently considered by Milton's commentators. Both claim to be inspired utterances, one being spoken by Saint Peter, the other by the prophet in the name of God. Though one is in poetry and the other in prose, both are in form pastorals. In both the unfaithful pastors are charged with feeding themselves and not the sheep. The latter in both instances are represented as diseased, scattered, and preyed upon by wild beasts. The tone</page><page sequence="2">212 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES of both passages is one of righteous indignation, deepening at the end to one of sombre menace. The last two lines of the passage in Lycidas, more than any other two lines in Miltoni's poetry, have exercised the ingenuity of critics, in the attempt to explain what Milton meant by the " two-handed engine." Warburton suggested that Milton referred to Saint Peter's sword, here metamorphosed into the two-handed sword of romance. " This supposition," Warton says, " only embarrasses the passage." The " engine," he thinks, is not a sword at all, but " the axe that was to cut off Laud's head." But, since Laud was not beheaded till 1645, whereas Lycidas was written in 1637, such anl identifica- tion would imply an oracular gift in Milton that even he, with his far from modest estimate of his own gifts, would not have claimed. With equal assurance Newtoni identifies the instrument wvith the axe " laid at the root of the trees" (Matt. iII, 10). This, as Aias- son says, ignores the fact that this weapon is at the door of a building, ancd not at the root of a tree. Masson himself identifies it as the two houses of Parliament. Gilfillan assures us that it is "the sword with two edges issuing out of Christ's mouth" (Rev. I, 16). Apparently the critics have been misled by the adjective " two- handed " into an attempt to find a retributive weapon dignjifie(d enough for Deity and yet possessed of effectiveness analogous to thlat of a double-barrelled guni. As a matter of fact there is probably no special significance in the term " two-handed " except that the weapon is represented as a trenchant one, and, perhaps, big and heavy, like the swords in use at the end of the Middle Ages. Hn-ge two-handed swords had been popular wvith the Scottish knights in the fourteenth century, and some of these Milton may have seen.' Whatever the origin of the symbol, Milton always refers to the instrument of God's correction as a two-handed sword. Such was Michael's, which he " brandished with huge two-handed sway," fell- ing " squadrons at once" (Paradise Lost, vi, 251). Now Michael represents God's justice, as is suggested by his name, which means 1A fine example of such a sword hanigs today in the Banquet Hall of Edinburgh Castle. Its entire length is six feet; the blade four feet and three inches, and the hilt twenty-two inches. It is such a weapon as might easily impress a less imaginative person than Milton as a sword requiring superhuman strength to wield, and so suggestive of the " armoury of God." Paradise Lost, VI, 321.</page><page sequence="3">MILTON AND EZEKIEL 213 "Who is like God," and his sword, which Milton tells us (line 321) was given him " from the armoury of God," was the sword of God's jtustice. If we could be certain that the " engine " of Lycidas was also the sword of God's justice-a supposition that Masson declares to be absurd-we should clear up the mystery of what Milton meant in this colntroverted passage. 'Ilat indeed the " engine " of Lycidas and the sword of Michael wvere each the sword of God's justice, and hence identical, seems reasonable from the fact that they probably had the same origin in the chapter of Ezekiel above referred to as having conceivably inspirecl Milton's invective against the clergy. Here (Ezekiel XXXVI, 11-18) the prophet represents God as promising to become a good shepherd to Israel, gathering the scattered sheep, and feecl- ing them in " a good pasture "; " but I will destroy," he says, " the fat and the strong, I will feed them with judgment." The last assertion is botlh a promise and a threat; and both are contained in the last word. It is the Hebrew word mishlpat, ren- dered in different conniectionis in the authorized version by three English words-judgment, ordilnance, justice. That it is a word of varied meaninlgs is shown still more plainly by the Septuagint, whiel renders it by no less than five different wvordIs, xpLUa, icpt'Ctl 8tKatlWAa StKatooiVrn7, EVUKl7O0t9. In this particular passage the word justice most adequately translates it; anad in the Jewislh tranis- latioln of the scriptures it is properly so rendered. The announce- ment that mzishlpat ('justice ') would henceforth be administered in the fold, coupled with the scathing denunciation of the unfaith- ful shepherds which had preceded, could hardly have escaped Mil- ton seeking a biblical precedent for denouncing and threatening the corrupt clergy of his day.2 2 That Milton's knowledge of Hebrew equipped him for recognizing the veiled threat contained in the Hebrew words there can be no question. We know that he owned a Hebrew Bible, given him by his tutor, Young, as early at 1625. And in his Latin poem Ad Patrem composed at Horton he wrote, Tuo, pater optime, sumptu Cum mihi Romulem patuit facundia linguoe Et Latii veneres, et quae Jovis ora decebant Grandia magniloquis elata vocabula Graiis, Addere suasisti quos jactat Gallia flores, Quoeque Palestinus loquitur mysteria vates.</page><page sequence="4">214 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES Granting that Milton may have found the suggestion of a veiled threat in the Hebrew text, it remains to show that he had biblical authority for making the instrument of God's justice upon evil- doers both in the elegy and the epic, a sword. Such authority any one of several passages in the Old Testament would furnish. Per- haps the most striking example occurs in the famous " sword-song " of Ezekiel (xxi, 14ff.), which, in spite of its obscurity, its abrupt transitions, and its strange anthropomorphism, contains one per- fectly clear image-that of Jehovah's sword in action. It is evi- dently personified; and, though not self-directed, is sentient, like the "two-handed engine" that "stands ready to smite" in the elegy. The exact meaning of th!e line in which the sword is ordered to be doubled and trebled is quite obscure. Translated literally, the words mean, " Let the sword be doubled a third," where the symbol is meant to suggest the intensity and energy of the divine punish- ment. Perhaps in the word htikaphal ('let it be. doubled') Milton found a suggestion of the adjective " two-handed " that he employs in both the elegy and the epic. Without, however, urging the rather remote possibility of a ver- bal influence of the Hebrew text, we may summarize our conclu- sions as follows. Because the editors of Milton have been men less familiar with the literature of Israel than with the Greek and Latin classics, and because they knew less of the Old Testament than of the New, they have hitherto ignored in their annotation of Milton's arraignment of the Anglican clergy a passage in Ezekiel which very possibly may have inspired it. Upon examination, the two passages in question appear strikingly alike. The likeness ap- pears, not only in their common pastoral quality, in the practical identity of the charges they embody against the spiritual guides of the people, and in the somber mood they express, but also in the fact that both end with the suggestion that a stern retributive jus- tice will be meted out to the uinfaithful shepherds.3 'That Milton's diatribe may have been inspired by Ezekiel seems the more probable in view of the extent of Ezekiel's influence upon him. Eze- kiel's visions, with their elaborate symbolism, suggested, no doubt, by the products of Babylonian art with which as an exile he was surrounded, appear to have made a deep impression on Milton's imagination. The pic- ture of "The chariot of Paternial Deity" (Pacradise Lost, VI, 750ff.), to</page><page sequence="5">DIE FORM INDE IM MITTELFRANKISCHIEN 215 If the probability that the IHebrew pastoral inspired Milton's arraignment be granted, then it becomes at once apparent that the combined promise and threat with which the Hebrew passage ends establishes a probability that the two-handed engine of the elegy is identical with the sword of MIichael in the epic, for the former also is obviously a means of retributive justice. The reasonableness of such an identification is further attested by the fact that Milton had scriptural authority for making the weapon of God's justice a sword. EDWARD CHAUNCEY BALDWIN.

So, if Milton in composing the elegy borrowed from Ezekiel, he was simply anticipatinog what afterwards he did on a larger scale, and more unmistakably.</page></plain_text>
