<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seraph, Snake, and Saint: The Subconscious Mind In James' Varieties CORDELL STRUG N a life which some feel was consecrated to conceptual confusion, William James never produced a more troublesome text than The Vari- eties of Religious Experience. Even the much maligned Pragmatism lectures pale before the submerged assumptions, hazy distinctions, and awe- inspiring overstatements of the Varieties. Among the many instructive problems provided by this book is a prime example of a neglected distinction growing up to cause trouble: the unwary reader does not realize until too late that there is something wrong with James' conception of the subconscious mind, a conception that plays a central role in his final conclusions. In this paper, I will first briefly indicate the fuzziness of James' conception of the subconscious; next, I will show how James puts the subconscious to good use early in the Varieties and how his fuzzy conception later turns into the rotten apple which spoils his conclusion; finally, I will discuss a brief passage in which James unwittingly suggests a different approach to the gods than the rather murky tunnel of the subconscious. I When James tells us that the Varieties is a "psychological" study, he means primarily that in it he will use the subconscious as a basic methodological tool. He calls the idea of the subconscious life "the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology since I have been a student of that science," and thinks it "casts light on many phenomena of religious biography."' Unfortunately, he spends very little time clarifying the notion and, given his broad remarks, one can pull out two different descriptions of it: one to make empiricists smile, one to make them frown. IWilliam James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (New York: New American Library/Mentor Books, 1958), p. 188. CORDELL STRUG was educated at MacMurray College, Indiana University, and Purdue University. He has been an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and is currently employed as a steamfitter. 505</page><page sequence="2">506 CORDELL STRUG When he is first discussing the subconscious, he seems to mean by it simply those interests, thoughts, and projects of a man which are not presently occupying his consciousness. Our different aims and interests are relatively independent of one another, and "when one group is present and engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may be excluded from the mental field."2 Thus the President of the United States may at times wonder if his true destiny were not to be a boy scout troop leader: perhaps when he is tramping through the prosperous fields of Florida, he even wishes he were not President and fancies himself a sturdy American woodsman. But when he is hard at work, comforting his people via television, the boy scout leader retreats toward the "outskirts" of the mind: he is President and would trade the job for none other in the world. The point here is simply that what we call "subconscious" is actually on the periphery of a man's conscious activity and as that activity changes, so does the periphery. In each man's consciousness, there is a part which "figures as focal and contains the excitement."3 But it would be mistaken to conclude that one part was, is, and will be the true self or that some parts are essentially "beneath" the conscious level. As our interests and tastes shift, so our centers of energy or centers of consciousness shift, and "subconscious" is simply a name for those aims of ours which are not central to our present task. Indeed James explicitly rejects the term "unconscious" because of its connotations.4 This is a rather non-troublesome description. It makes no obvious ontological commitments - "Buddhists or Humians can perfectly well describe the facts in the phenomenal terms which are their favorites"5; it introduces no strange entities; it does not imply that the content of the subconscious is anything more than what one might pick up in one's experience and then ignore for a time. So far the empiricists can smile. Trouble arises when James begins to speak of "subliminal regions of the mind,"6 as if there were an undiscovered country beyond the horizons of the conscious life which was - in a stronger sense than that above - out there with strange things dwelling in it. It is true that his remarks remain rather broad and he always insists that the "memories, thoughts, and feelings which are extramarginal and outside of the primary consciousness altogether ... must be classed as conscious facts of some sort."' Yet he has been credited as anticipating - in the Varieties - Jung's notion of an impersonal unconscious.8 And some of his statements do lend themselves to such an interpretation. For example, when discussing mysticism, he says: 2 Ibid., p. 160. 3Ibid., p. 161. 4 Ibid., p. 170. 5Ibid., p. 161. 6 Ibid., p. 191. 7Ibid., p. 188. 8L.W. Grensted, The Psychology of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1952), p. 60.</page><page sequence="3">SERAPH, SNAKE, AND SAINT 507 It is evident that from the point of view of their psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and these lower mysticisms spring from the same mental level, from that great subliminal or transmarginal region of which science is beginning to admit the existence, but of which so little is really known. That region contains every kind of matter: "seraph and snake" abide there side by side.9 And, further on, he gives his most extensive characterization of the subliminal region (and to clear the air of the bad smell of psychical research, he suggests we call "full, sunlit consciousness" the A-region of personality): The B-region, then, is obviously the larger part of each of us, for it is the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of everything that passes unrecorded or unobserved. ... it harbors the springs of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses, likes, dislikes, and prejudices. Our intuitions, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions, persuasions, convictions, and in general all our non-rational operations, come from it. It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may return to it. In it arise whatever mystical experiences we may have. .... It is also the fountainhead of much that feeds our religion. In persons deep in the religious life, ... the door into this region seems unusually wide open.'0 It is true that there are no explicit ontological commitments; the language remains metaphorical. But metaphors can produce conceptual ulcers. The difference between what can be called an empirical and an exotic view of the subconscious becomes crucial in the latter pages of the Varieties. The most obvious difference in the views is this: if everyone has the same sort of "subliminal region," then our dealings with this region - the "ideas" contained therein, the experience it forms - will all be fundamentally the same; if, however, the subconscious is understood as the periphery of a man's consciousness, then its constitution would be determined by his experience and it would make no sense to speak of a "region" of consciousness which all of us could be in communication with or a full-fledged "idea" which could exist in all of us which was independent of all religious traditions. Now let us take a closer look at what James does with the subconscious. II The most fruitful use he makes of the subconscious is in his analysis of conversion. In the terms he develops, "To say that a man is 'converted' means ... that religious ideas, previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take a central place, and that religious aims form the habitual centre of his energy."II The important thing to notice about these shifts of energy - and James acknowledges his inability to be more exact - is that they can be very sudden and that the acquisition of ideas and the formation of peripheral centres may in some persons go on almost unnoticed: 9James, Varieties, p. 326. 'OIbid., p. 366. 1' Ibid., p. 162.</page><page sequence="4">508 CORDELL STRUG when you get a subject in whom the subconscious life ... is largely developed, and in whom motives habitually ripen in silence, you get a case of which you can never give a full account, and in which, both to the subject and the onlookers, there may appear an element of marvel.12 Examples of surprising shifts of energy which are most accessible to working psychologists are, of course, usually of a non-religious sort, "consisting of unusually suggestible hypnotic subjects and of hysteric patients."'3 James expects these examples to throw light on certainformal characteristics of the experience of a sudden shift of energy-centre. Without claiming that these help us grasp the specific nature of religious conversions, we can still use them to highlight the formal process involved so that we do not look upon them "as if they were outside of nature's order altogether."'4 From our knowledge of these other subjects, we can draw certain conclusions: The most important consequence of having a strongly developed ultra-marginal life of this sort is that one's ordinary fields of consciousness are liable to incursions from it of which the subject does not guess the source, and which, therefore, take for him the form of unaccountable impulses to act, or inhibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or even of hallucinations of sight or hearing. .... Interpreting the unknown after the analogy of the known, it seems to me that hereafter, wherever we meet with a phenomenon of automatism, ... we are bound first of all to make search whether it be not an explosion, into the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated outside of those fields in subliminal regions of the mind. We should look, therefore, for its source in the subject's subconscious life."5 The point to be grasped here is that the subconscious gives us a framework for understanding the formal process of conversion. And the cash-value of this framework appears when we consider claims based on the process of conversion itself: its suddenness, perhaps its violence, etc. It may or may not be the case that the major theological traditions make such claims: it is probably true, however, that in sects with weak theological backgrounds which are strongly oriented around the revival experience there is at least a great temptation to make such claims. One such claim might be that the suddenness of conversion gives evidence of miraculous intervention: "Is an instantaneous conversion a miracle in which God is present as he is present in no change of heart less strikingly abrupt?"'6 James' conclusion is that we are not forced, simply because of a person's sudden conversion, to postulate a miraculous work of God as we would not be in more gradual cases: "gradual" converts need not lament their mundane sanctification, for what accounts for the more spectacular cases is not miraculous intervention but the fact that: 12Ibid., p. 163. 1'3bid., p. 188. 14Ibid., p. 37. 15 Ibid., pp. 188-90. '6Ibid., p. 186.</page><page sequence="5">SERAPH, SNAKE, AND SAINT 509 in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have one of those subjects who are in possession of a large region in which mental work can go on subliminally, and from which invasive experiences, abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, may come.'7 In other words, as far as miracles are concerned, both sorts of converts stand or fall together. Another such claim might be that, to claim membership in the visible community of believers, one must have undergone a striking experience of conversion. James insists that we look elsewhere for the distinguishing marks of the spirit: were it true that a suddenly converted man as such is ... of an entirely different kind from a natural man, ... there surely ought to be some exquisite classmark ... which, so far as it went, would prove him more excellent than even the most highly gifted among mere natural men.8 Such a class mark is precisely what cannot be found. Again, we should rather ascribe sudden conversions to the possession by the subjects involved of "a large region in which mental work can go on subliminally." Thus, here are two possible claims made strictly on the basis of the striking process involved in conversion, and introducing the concept of subconscious life allows us to cast doubt on their validity. At this point the empiricists are still smiling, if not laughing out loud. But by the time James reaches his last lecture, he has turned about almost completely: he suggests we take the notion of divine intervention seriously and uses the subconscious as a launching pad for his speculations. III There are a number of problems which descend on the reader in the final pages of the Varieties, but I have not the space to go into them at length. Let me simply indicate the way James' mind is moving as he approaches his conclusions. He has already rejected the idea of divine intervention in the course of physicalevents. Prayers are no match for floods, typhoons, and tyrants. But on the other hand they give one strength to meet such things. There are times when men feel themselves in touch with a "More" which floods into their consciousness and allows them to carry on the fight. Thus James feels justified in again using the subconscious to understand these experiences: but now, far from being a mundane explanation of a seemingly miraculous event, the subconscious stands as part of the miracle. The gods may be absent from the world of matter, but they live in the world of mind. We have only to dip into the subconscious to meet them - and vice versa. '7Ibid., p. 191. '8Ibid., p. 192.</page><page sequence="6">510 CORDELL STRUG To put all this in yesterday's theological jargon: James is playing explanatory tag with the god of the gaps. This may be a problem which only bothers theologians but its philosophical cousin is a vicious dualism which haunts the entire book. With this in mind, let us look at the two "hypotheses" James offers in his final lecture. The first is an explicit invocation of the subconscious: Let me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its farther side, the "more" with which in religious experience we feel ourselves connected is on its hither side the subconscious life.'9 There is a trifle more to his first hypothesis than this, however: he wants to claim not only that the subconscious is involved in religious experience, but also that this involvement guarantees the reality of the supposed "union" or "encounter" with "higher powers." Leaving open the question of the nature of those powers ("its farther side"), bringing in the subconscious allows him to say that "the sense of union with the powers beyond us is a sense of something, not merely apparently, but literally true."20 This is not very much, but it is perhaps more than it appears to be. It would still be open to an atheist to claim that the mystic is only talking to himself, but implicit in this remark is the charge that the mystic is simply fooling himself. Now, although James' first hypothesis would not allow one to reject the atheist's remark completely, it would allow one to reject the implicit charge. The mystic is not simply fooling himself - for a great deal of what he feels to be true is true. Perhaps it has not been shown that divine intervention is taking place, but we do have evidence that, let us say, a new store of energy has been opened to the individual, that he now has the strength to do things he could not before. James is saying that although a mystic may be wrong about what the higher powers are, he is not wrong about thinking himself in connection with these higher powers. Thus, for the first hypothesis: we have in the fact that the consciousperson is continuous with a wider selfthrough which saving experiences come, a positive content of religious experience which, it seems to me, is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.21 This much, apparently, James is willing to "recommend . . . for general belief."22 But how wide is "the wider self"? What is the "farther side" of the "more'"? James now offers us his second hypothesis - one dealing with the nature of "the farther limits of this extension of our personality" - and here he is much less sure of his ground since he willingly stamps this hypothesis an "overbelief'23: 19 Ibid., p. 386. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid., p. 388. 22Ibid., p. 385. 23Ibid., p. 388.</page><page sequence="7">SERAPH, SNAKE, AND SAINT 511 The whole drift of my education goes to persuade me that the world of our present consciousness is only one out of many worlds of consciousness that exist, and that those other worlds must contain experiences which have a meaning for our life also.24 These "worlds of consciousness" are presumably what lie on the "farther side" of the subconscious, another "dimension of existence" into which the "further limits of our being plunge."25 But these unseen regions are not simply lying out there like so many empty lots. These are the homes of the gods. Or perhaps these "worlds of consciousness" are the gods. James speaks of "communing with" the unseen region and that region "producing effects"; he seems to have in mind a kind of freely floating consciousness which is still supposed to be a person-like deity. The effects produced are conceived as changes wrought upon us, our personalities. We go out and change the world; if the gods want something done, they must first dispose us to do it: If asked just where the differences in fact which are due to God's existence come in, I should have to say that in general I have no hypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of "prayerful communion," especially when certain kinds of incursion from the subconscious region take part in it, immediately suggests.26 When we commune with [the unseen region in question], work is actually done upon our finite personality, for we are turned into new men, and consequences in the way of conduct follow in the natural world upon our regenerative change.27 For the most part, these "worlds of consciousness" remain apart from our own; "yet the two become continuous at certain points, and higher energies filter in."28 It is important to realize that this second hypothesis, dealing with other worlds of consciousness, is not an explanatory hypothesis invoked to cover the - otherwise unexplainable - phenomenon of religious experience. It is a hypothesis about the ultimate nature of reality which is based on religious experience and James' analysis of it. Religious experience, if one can say that James "explains" it, is explained by the subconscious. And it is the unexplored, open-ended if you will, nature of that strange entity which gives James' picture of the world the possibility of being true. IV I am willing to grant James that the subconscious is a "well-accredited entity." The question is, however, what sort of entity is it? Even though he underlines the fact that not much is known about the subconscious, the way our ignorance is understood may lead us into difficulties. 24Ibid., p. 391. 25 Ibid., pp. 388-89. 26 Ibid., p. 394. 27 Ibid., p. 389. 28Ibid., p. 391.</page><page sequence="8">512 CORDELL STRUG Let us take a closer look at the first hypothesis James proposed: Let me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its farther side, the "more" with which in religious experience we feel ourselves connected is on its hither side the subconscious continuation of our conscious life.29 But is there a farther side? One may grant that a mystical experience seems to come from beyond the self, but once the subconscious is introduced, are we still justified in talking about a farther side? How much of a farther side does the "more" need? Admittedly, James' further claims about the farther side are given only as possibilities. But the point is that they seem not just mere possibilities, but unjustified and unnecessary additions. The simple fact of a subconscious seems to provide us with all the explanation we need for the sense of otherness, of outside control, found in religious experience. I distinguished above between an empirical and an exotic conception of the subconscious. James makes no such distinction. More importantly, nothing he says about the subconscious makes the stronger conception more plausible, while some of the claims he bases on the subconscious seem to require the stronger conception for their validity. This seems to be what has happened in his conclusion. He leaves open the question of what the "farther side" of the "more" is really like - pleading ignorance; but because of his stronger conception of the subconscious, he feels certain that there is a "farther side," a farther side, moreover, which is so exotic that he feels entirely justified in speaking of other realms of consciousness which produce effects in our own. True, this last hypothesis is labelled pure speculation - but it is the earlier hypothesis which allows the speculation and does that, it seems, only by making implicit use of a conception we have been given no reason to accept. As the Varieties grew, so grew the subconscious. In the early discussions of conversion, James seemed to be working with the tamer conception. Here at the end, the sketchiness of his conception has allowed him to sail out on a speculative sea with less of a scientific entity under him than he thought. And his positive conclusions about the truth of religion, so heavily based on the subconscious, are seriously undermined by a rejection of the more exotic aspects of that concept. V But no power in the universe could keep James from being inconsistent and, in conclusion, I should like to discuss briefly a passage at the end of the Varieties in which he gives us something more than the subconscious to chew on. 291bid., p. 386.</page><page sequence="9">SERAPH, SNAKE, AND SAINT 513 He is attacking what he labels the "survival theory of religion," the theory that religion depends on so-called "primitive" modes of thought: The pivot round which the religious life, as we have traced it, revolves, is the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny. Religion, in short, is a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism. The gods believed in - whether by crude savages or by men disciplined intellectually - agree with each other in recognizing personal calls. Religious thought is carried on in terms of personality, this being, in the world of religion, the one fundamental fact. Today, quite as much as at any previous age, the religious individual tells you that the divine meets him on the basis of his personal concerns.30 If our mode of thought has changed at all, says James, we have become less animistic, interested more in those aspects of things which allow us to get a handle on them, so to speak. And the attack on religion he has in mind is based on a rejection of anthropomorphic thinking: Pure anachronism! says the survival theory; - anachronism for which deanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy required. The less we mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in universal and impersonal terms, the truer heirs of science we become.3' Against this, James argues that in the religious mode of thought, "we deal with realities in the completest sense of the term."32 That this way of thinking is labelled "primitive" should not blind us to the fact that it is a very natural way to respond to things. As he points out, it is still in these richer and dramatic aspects that religion delights to dwell. It is the terror and beauty of phenomena, the "promise" of the dawn and of the rainbow, the "voice" of the thunder, the "gentleness" of the summer rain, the "sublimity" of the stars, and not the physical laws which these things follow, by which the religious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as of yore, the devout man tells you that in the solitude of his room or of the fields he still feels the divine presence, that inflowings of help come in reply to his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with security and peace.33 A man who can preserve this sort of contact with the things of this earth could never, like Pascal, shudder at the silence of a mechanical universe. One would expect James to be this sort of man and, for example, he seems to have actually enjoyed the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. He wrote of the incident later, recalling that a friend of his had hoped he might encounter one: "By jove," I said to myself, "here's B.'s old earthquake, after all!" And then, as it went crescendo, "And a jolly good one it is, too!" I said ... The emotion consisted wholly of glee and admiration; glee at the vividness which such an abstract idea or verbal term as "earthquake" could put on when translated into sensible reality and verified concretely; and admiration at the way in which the frail little wooden house could hold itself together in spite of such a shaking. I felt no trace whatever of fear; it was pure delight and welcome. 30Ibid., p. 371. 31 Ibid., p. 376. 32Ibid., p. 377. 33Ibid., p. 376.</page><page sequence="10">514 CORDELL STRUG "Go it," I almost cried aloud, "and go it stronger!" . I personified the earthquake as a permanent individual entity. ... It came, moreover, directly to me. It stole in behind my back, and once inside the room had me all to itself, and could manifest itself convincingly. Animus and intent were never more present in any human action, nor did any human activity ever more definitely point back to a living agent as its source and origin.34 I remember lying on my bed in college during the beginning of a mild earthquake. While my bed slid around the room and the pictures flapped against the walls, I kept wondering how the guys from the other dorms were making it all happen. In such dramatic cases, the sense of a personality behind the act is almost irresistible. But it can happen on a more day-to-day level as well. I had forgotten my coat one day while bicycling to the University. It was late fall and I was terribly chilled, especially after I parked my bike and trudged across a shadowed courtyard. To make things worse, there was a coal-strike on and I was worried about the possible disappearance of a warm hearth chez Strug. My bones were rattling from the present and projected cold. But it was one of those days which are dreadfully chilly when cloudy and instantly warm when the sun reappears, and as I crossed the mall I was suddenly standing in the sunshine, completely warm. I stopped, raised my arm and said "thank you." I suppose I was talking to the sun although the gesture was so spontaneous as to be almost without a definite object. I will admit as readily as anyone that the sun could not have intended to give me some warmth because I was in a bad way. Yet there it was. It felt like a friend. I said "thanks." Why not? The claim James wants to make is that moments like these are more important in our total relationship to reality than any scientific knowledge we might have. As I said above, he wants to say that at those times "we deal with realities in the completest sense of the term."35 Then we see a thing with all it has, at its best. To throw away nature's lively face for a scientific diagram is to throw reality out the window: A bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word "raisin," with one real egg instead of the word "egg," might be an inadequate meal, but it would at least be a commencement of reality. The contention of the survival-theory that we ought to stick to non-personal elements exclusively seems like saying that we ought to be satisfied forever with reading the naked bill of fare.36 Now for the cash-value of this discussion. James had held out the subconscious as a realm from which the gods need not yet be forced to retreat. He gave up the rest of the world as lost for them through "scientific criticism." But here, when he is defending the essence of the religious point of view, he makes no such concessions. On the contrary, 34William James, Memories and Studies (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911), pp. 209-12. 35James, Varieties, p. 377. 36Ibid., p. 378.</page><page sequence="11">SERAPH, SNAKE, AND SAINT 515 what he asks us to do is reconsider all of experience. Far from isolating the explanatory force of "divine intervention" to one small part of reality, he argues that given a scientific explanation of all phenomena there is still more to be said about them on the basis of our experience. This suggestion actually covers all the ground the subconscious did and more. What had impressed James about the subconscious was that one felt as though one were encountering higher powers. But that is precisely what he asks us to see in the promise of the dawn and the power of the earthquake. The aspect of the subconscious that interests him is just what interests him in his earthquake experience and what he advises us to look for in our relationship to nature. If one can appreciate James' suggestion, the subconscious as an explanatory tool adds little weight to his case, while bringing along its own difficulties. (This is not to deny that it is useful in the earlier chapters of the Varieties-e.g., in understanding the process of conversion.) At one stroke, he spares us the endless theological game of salvaging something science has yet to explain as property of the gods and gets rid of all that unnerving dualism. We are asked to consider different aspects of phenomena. But we are not asked to forget matter entirely for the sake of mind. We are not asked to wander through different realms of consciousness which somehow overlap. Here James does not isolate consciousness from matter but rather soaks matter in consciousness. This is the most satisfying part of this suggestion and, though it remains vague, it is nevertheless fascinating. To James' two categories of thinkers --naturalist and supernaturalist (the latter divided into crude and refined)-- I would add a third, or rather I would divide the first into crude and glorified and call James a "glorified naturalist." Of course this is based only on an isolated discussion in his concluding lecture. As in many other places, the Varieties does not hang together but falls apart in a fascinating way. We must see the subconscious and the interlocking realms of consciousness as the official conclusion of the book. But once we reject them, we must also see that there is more in the conclusion than its official parts, as there always is in James. This is what makes his books, particularly the Varieties, so delightful. The arguments crumble in our hands but they do not turn to stone. Along with our headaches, we are usually left with a very charming suggestion or two--no more, but no less.</page></plain_text>
