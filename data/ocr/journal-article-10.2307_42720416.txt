<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIAN PHILOSOPHY A SOURCE BOOK IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY. Edited by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press. 1957. Pp. xxxix 683. THE purpose of this work is "to supply Western readers with basic source material . . . which represents all of the major philosophical systems and perspective of India, not merely its earliest and most religious background" (p. vii). To achieve this purpose, selections "of an expository rather than a polemic nature" have been chosen from the "basic original formulations of the philosophies of the systems," and to these have been added some sixty pages from the works of Sri Aurobindo and of Mr. Rad- hakrishnan, who "represent the most important interpretational developments in Indian thought in the present day" (p. ix). The plan of the book includes a preface by Mr. Moore (from which the quotations of the above paragraph have been taken), who is well known as editor of the quarterly Philosophy East and West, and of the two volumes Philosophy East and West and Essay in EasUWest Philosophy , reporting respectively the fruits of the East-West Philosophers' Conferences at the University of Hawaii in the years 1939 and 1949. The preface is followed by a general introduction to the history and spirit of Indian philo- sophy (pp. xv-xxix) by Mr. Radhakrishnan, perhaps the greatest</page><page sequence="2">476 PHILIPPINE STUDIES living authority in this field and certainly an author whose col- laboration in this instance will be appreciated by all the western students of philosophy for whom the source book is intended. Then come the selections themselves, grouped according to their pertinence to the Vedic Period, Epic Period, Heterodox Systems, Orthodox System, and Contemporary Thought. Three appendices (Pronunciation and Accent, Original Sources of English Transla- tions Used, English Translations of Selections Used), a biblio- graphy both general and particular (pp. 643-669), and an index of names and subjects by both English and Sanskrit listings (pp. 671-683) complete the book. Only an expert in Indian language and philosophy could evaluate the editors' choice of selections, or the occasional emen- dations of translations, or the frequent and extremely helpful an- notations to the texts. One does not have to be an expert, how- ever, to recognize in a A Source Book in Indian Philosophy an excellently bound, printed and edited volume, which covers its enormous fields in a way which could well serve as model for all single-volume source books of philosophy. And this volume will undoubtedly go far to "convince skeptical Westerners that much of Indian philosophy is philosophy not only in its unique Indian forms but also in accordance with the strictest standards of open- mindedness, critical analyis, and rational investigation" (p. vii). Besides the General Introduction, the editors have provided "a short explanatory introduction accompanying the selections from each major system/' most of them the work of Mr. Rad- hakrishnan. These introductions effectively bridge for the stu- dent the gap from western to Indian thought and are, in the main, objective. In few instances, however, the editors have in- serted personal views which detract from the otherwise general impression of their objectivity and scholarship. Thus Mr. Moore, introducing the selection from Mr. Radharkrishnan, affirms his co-editor's "absolute tolerance" and lauds him as "a profound cri- tic of all forms of exclusiveness, one-sided perspective, dogmatism, and intolerance," who has "taken religion out of the realm of conflicts and bickerings, out of the realm of dogmas and authori- tarianism, and has made it into a living philosophy of the spirit, in which he has imbued religion with depth and meaning and practicality for India and for all mankind" (pp. 610-611). This is mere demagoguery. As for Mr. Radhakrishnan's "absolute to- lerance," the reader can very well take its measure for himself.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 477 In his introduction to the selections illustrating "Monotheistic and Monistic Tendencies" in the Vedas, Mr. Radhakrishnan in- forms him - quite dogmatically: "The mind of man is not satis- fied with an anthropomorphic deity . . . Whatever the emotional value of a personal God may be, the truth sets up a different standard and requires a different object of worship"(p.l7). It is to be regretted that such blemishes have been admitted into a work admirable in all other respects. The mutual under- standing and union of East and West, which the editors have de- servedly at heart, would have been considerably advanced by their omission. Fortunately, such blemishes are rare. The users of this volume will look forward to the appearance of similar source books for Chinese, Buddhist, and Japanese philosophy, promised by Mr. Moore in the preface. Ralph B.
