Abstract This paper describes a decorated carinated vessel excavated at the Teouma Lapita site, on the south coast of Efate, central Vanuatu. The vessel contained human bones and, following reconstruction, was found to have had four modelled birds on its rim. The incidence and dating of other burial pot assemblages is examined to place the find in a wider context within the Island Pacific. The Teouma Lapita site on the south coast of Efate, Central Vanuatu was uncovered through construction work in 2003. It is one of the earliest Lapita sites yet identified in Vanuatu, dating to c. 3200-3000 BP, and excavations in 2004 revealed it to be the site of the earliest cemetery yet found in the Pacific (Bedford et al 2004, 2006). The well-preserved nature of the site and the identification of distinct activity areas provide a rare opportunity to define in detail Lapita ceramic function and use. This is particularly the case in the cemetery area where an assortment of decorated Lapita vessels was associated with burial ritual. Amongst the sherds recovered in the cemetery area of the site in 2004 was a modelled clay bird's head (Figure 1) very similar to one found in the SZ-8 Lapita site on Nendo Island in the Reef-Santa Cruz Group of the Southeast Solomons (Green 1979b:41). Dentate decoration can be seen running from behind the neck to underneath the eye and again above the eye. The eyes are represented by impressed circles and further dentate-stamping appeared to define a wing. Initial interpretations, based entirely on conjecture, were that it may have been a handle of some kind. Investigations at Teouma in 2005 concentrated on the cemetery area alone, where some 100 square metres were excavated. The western edge of the 10 by 10 metre area was adjacent to the area where the bird's head had been uncovered. Clarification of the vessel form and function associated with the modelled head was soon revealed, although some radical reinterpretation of the handle hypothesis was required. Vessel association was initially hinted at by a number of rim sherds from a carinated vessel decorated with a dentate-stamped face motif. On the inside ^of the rim of three sherds were signs that something had once been attached. This was confirmed when an almost whole bird was recovered, still attached to a rim sherd of the same vessel (Figure 2). The bird, it was revealed, was not remotely handle-like but rather positioned on the inside of the rim, fulfilling a symbolic and decorative role, with its head orientated towards the centre of the vessel (Figure 3). The three rim sherds with signs of once having had a bird attached, along with the more intact example, indicate a minimum of four birds on the rim. The decorated sherds of this vessel were spread primarily over four square metres through different spits of the lowest cultural layer, although the largest concentrations were found in only two adjacent square metres. The basal part of the pot, largely still in situ, contained a collection of assorted human bone. The upper part of the pot had been broken and scattered in antiquity as a result of disturbance from later burials in the same area of the site. Figure 1.

Modelled clay bird excavated in 2005 at Teouma. It is attached to the rim of a Lapita pot, facing into the vessel interior. The recovery and reconstruction of this carinated pot with modelled birds on the rim adds a further very distinctive vessel form to the Lapita repertoire. However, the accumulated evidence of 50 years of research, along with the recovery of only a single example to date from the extensive excavations at Teouma, suggest that it will remain an extremely rare find. Its association with human remains both highlights and confirms the ceremonial nature of these decorated vessels generally and this form in particular. At the same time it indicates variation in burial practice and ritual at the site. This pot, along with another containing a skull (Bedford et al. 2006) from Teouma, provides the earliest evidence for pot or jar burials in the Pacific, a practice that has close parallels to burial ritual in Neolithic Island Southeast Asia including Taiwan (Bellwood 1997:220-1,240-1,272; Bintarti 2000; Chazine 2005; Harrisson 1974; Thiel 1986-7). Modelling Amongst the tens of thousands of decorated sherds that have been recovered through archaeological excavation, survey and avocational collection across the Lapita distribution there are very rare reports of modelled clay anthropo- Figure 3.

Those that are decorated with dentate-stamping include a possible modelled human figure with decoration on the buttocks from site RL-6 in the Reef Islands of the southeast Solomons (Green 1979a: 16), a clay head from Kamgot, on Babase Island, New Ireland (Summerhayes 1998:100) and three faces from Boduna Island, West New Britain (Torrence and White 2001). A further, somewhat ill-defined modelled object with dentate- stamping, has been recovered from the Lau Islands in Fiji (O'Day et al 2004). Another clay modelled head, without dentate decoration was found at NKM001 in New Caledonia (Frimigacci 1981; Sand 1996:122) and a moulded face, of somewhat uncertain provenance, has been found at Naigani in Fiji (Best 198 1 : 1 1). A further modelled clay figure, of the avian variety, is the already-mentioned dentate-stamped bird head from SZ-8 in the Reef-Santa Cruz Group (Green 1979b:41). Across the Pacific, archaeologically recovered clay modelled faces or figures of any form that post-date the Lapita period, are very rare. Some of the few examples identified to date are those from the Mangaasi site, also on Efate. They included a number of animal-like handles and an animal head (Garanger 1971:Figs 2 and 9) dating to around 2000 BP. Undated excavated assemblages containing pottery vessels with modelled human faces and heads and bird's heads are known from Selesmilage sites 3 and 4 in the Makbon area of the Bird's Head of western New Guinea, and turtle heads were found applied to the rim of an excavated vessel from Kumo Island, off Tóbelo in northern Halmahera (Solheim 1991:14, 16-17). Pots with moulded human heads have been surface-collected from Jembekaki Fort on Batanta Island, off the western tip of the Bird's Head of New Guinea (Galis 1960; Galis and Kamma 1958). Some of the modelled heads from Jembekaki were placed on the rim looking into the pot. For the recent past the picture is very different than the few examples above might suggest. A wide array of modelled faces on pot surfaces, modelled figures on the rims of pots and figurines have been recorded across much of New Guinea. They are vessel forms that are often, although not exclusively, used in a range of ceremonial activities (May and Tuckson 1982). Face pots have also been recorded in similarly late contexts in New Caledonia (Glaumont 1895:45; Sand 1995:146). While there is as yet little infor- mation on the antiquity of this tradition of modelling in New Guinea, the well-defined and lengthy ceramic sequences from such places as Buka, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji indicate that such modelling was restricted both in terms of production and chronology, features also noted for the Lapita period (see also Best 2002:72). Modelled anthropomorphic heads or faces with dentate- stamped designs have been argued as providing supportive evidence (Summerhayes 1998; Torrence and White 2001) of earlier assertions that associated tattooing with dentate- stamping (Green 1979a; Green 1985; Kirch 1997). In terms of contributing to this debate the dentate-stamped birds are somewhat neutral. Others have suggested that modelled heads reinforce the idea that dentate-stamping is being com- Α Λ bined with an earlier tradition of carved three-dimensional art, most of which has not survived due to utilisation of perishable materials (Torrence and White 2001:139). This may well be the case but the parallels found in Island Southeast Asia in vessel form, modelled clay figures and association with human remains suggest that the Teouma bird pot at least is connected with traditions that had their origins much further to the northwest (Cameron 2005; Dizon and Santiago 1996; Fox 1970:113-4; Lape 2000:162-3; van Stein-Callenfels 1952:90, Plate XIX; Tenazas 1974). Pot burial Burial in pots has been reported previously from Oceania but is comparatively rare, being found in New Guinea and its offshore islands, Bougainville, New Caledonia, and now in Vanuatu. As there has been no recent survey of this phenomenon in Oceania an Appendix is provided below in tabular form showing the distribution of the practice and, where such information is available, dates for its occurrence. A useful survey of pot burial for West Papua and Papua New Guinea was given by Guise (1985), based largely on the PNG National Museum site files. This included two accompanying maps but was largely without other references. This information was drawn upon, along with further references that were apparently not available to Guise at the time or which are of more recent date. Oilier and Holdsworth (1977) summarised cave burial practices from Milne Bay Province, PNG, with many useful references. From the references examined it is not always clear whether burial in pots or burial with accompanying pots as grave goods is being referred to. This latter practice is also found at Teouma, where a large upturned carinated vessel with dentate-stamped decoration was seemingly in association either with a pot containing a human skull with an upturned flat-bottomed dish on top of it, and/or with an adjacent inhumation (see photographs in Bedford et al. 2006). For this reason we have included references to both practices in the Appendix. Pots as grave goods are attested from the New Guinea region, possibly Bougainville, Vanuatu, Fiji, the Marianas Islands and Palau. Whether in fact the upturned flat-bottomed dish at Teouma was merely sealing the burial urn, or whether it represents the practice of placing a pot on top of the skull is unclear. This latter practice, as can be seen from the several examples given in the Appendix, is surprisingly widespread in the Island Pacific. It has been recorded for New Guinea, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and possibly Guam. The practice of placing a pot over the skull attracted the notice of Riesenfeld (1950:329-330), who considered it typical of his "stone-using" or "megalithic" migrants, and the practice was supposedly often combined with burial in a sitting position. It is notable that it is also a practice recorded for Taiwan in the Neolithic Beinan Culture, where placing "a large half pot over the face or head of the dead person" was common practice at the Peinan burial site where pottery was</page><page sequence="4">also found as grave goods with primary inhumations in slate coffins (Lien 1990: 345, 346). Placing a pot over the skull is also found later in Taiwan in the Iron Age Fanziyuan Culture. Extended and prone burials are found in that culture and "the skull is usually covered by a pot" (Tsang 2000:155). The Appendix does not claim to be exhaustive but represents occurrences from all the areas where we believe that pot burial was practiced in the Island Pacific. In compiling the Appendix it was necessary to be somewhat selective in what references were accepted as relevant. For instance, Riesenfeld (1950:639) quotes Schlaginhaufen (1910:39) as suggesting that some of the jars produced in the Sepik area of New Guinea might have been used for burial, but the reference is vague and not supported by other authors, and so is omitted from the Appendix. Also omitted, but worth noting, is the presence of burial urns in stone on Choiseul Island in the Western Solomons (Bernatzik 1935:73-5, fig. 43). As far as could be ascertained this is a unique occurrence in the Island Pacific, although not uncommon in prehistoric Island and Mainland Southeast Asia, where stone sarcophagi are also found in Metal Age contexts of the last 2000 years (Bellwood 1997: 290, 293, 306; Sayavongkhamdy and Bellwood 2000). The Appendix shows that pot burial is by no means found in all areas where pottery was used prehistorically, and tends in many cases to be a phenomenon of the last millennium, particularly in the New Guinea area. In New Caledonia it is a practice that is primarily found between 2000 and 1000 BP. If we turn to burial where pots have been placed on top of the head, there is a New Caledonian example from the immediately post-Lapita period, dating to about 2700 BP. The only Fijian example of this practice dates to about 1700-1500 BP and comes from Sigatoka on Viti Levu. Pots as grave goods as opposed to burial in pots have been reported ethnographically from various places. Archaeologically it is sometimes difficult to establish a convincing primary association between pottery and burials in a site. Early first millennium BC Palau would seem at first glance to be the nearest in age to the Teouma case for pottery as grave goods, but there are serious problems with radiocarbon dates from that archipelago, particularly those involving the dating of pottery temper (Anderson et al 2005). This means that the examples from Palau could potentially be much younger than their apparent age. All of these practices are associated with Austronesian-speaking areas, or areas such as Koiari in southern Papua which were in close association with and adjacent to Austronesian- speaking groups. Conclusion The study of the Teouma pots and a survey of the comparative literature reveal that Teouma presents the earliest known Pacific examples of pot burial, and the earliest example of pottery as grave goods yet found in the region. If the dentate-decorated flat-bottomed dish placed over the skull contained in a second burial pot is taken as a representative of the mortuary practice of placing a pot over the skull, rather than simply as a convenient 'lid' for the burial vessel, then this practice too finds its earliest Pacific representative in Teouma1. Pot burial and pottery as grave goods are widespread in Island Southeast Asia in Neolithic contexts that might be seen as at least in part ancestral to Lapita, and placement of a pot over the skull in mortuary ritual is known from Neolithic and later contexts in Taiwan. One possibility is that such practices were continually reinvented, as might be perceived to be the explanation for pot burial in the Massim area of Milne Bay Province, PNG during the last 1000 years and its practice in the preceding millennium in distant New Caledonia. An alternative would be to see them as an ancestral Island Southeast Asian Neolithic burial complex that spread to the Pacific with Lapita and represents a continuous tradition in some areas until European contact. Golson (1972:581-586) saw the Massim examples as representing a later period of contact with Island Southeast Asia in the more recent past. As we clearly lack the evidence of continuous mortuary ritual sequences over much of the Island Pacific in the areas covered by the Appendix, an open mind on the question until further evidence is adduced would seem to be perhaps the most prudent stance to take.
