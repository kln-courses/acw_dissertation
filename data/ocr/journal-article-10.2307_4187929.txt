He was born in East Lansing, Michigan, and received his academic preparation at Michigan State University. He was formerly on the faculty at Michigan State University; Director of the Basic Science Unit at Campbell-Ewald Company in Detroit; and Visiting Professor of Advertising at the University of Illinois. Dr. Stewart's professional interests are in advertising and consumer behavior research, the psychology of communication, communication theory, and psycholinguistics. He has published over two dozen articles and one textbook in these areas. ABSTRACT If the advertiser is to ever receive coherent explanations on the relation between his advertising and subsequent consumer behavior, then a few fundamental principles of science must be observed in the performance of research in this area. Explanations about the advertising-consumer behavior relation are significant to the extent that they yield the power to predict. Prediction is based on general- ized causality relations, not statistical correlations. Coherent adver- tising research begins with hypotheses (definitions) of key psycho- logical phenomena that have not been equivocated into physical phenomena either within the definition or the experimental design constructed for their isolation and identification. JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING, 1974, 33), 16-20 Advertising and Consumer Behavior E xplanations about advertising gain their signi- ficance in terms of causality statements that possess a high degree of confirmation in physi- cal reality. Such statements are known as scientific laws. In a rigorous sense, because advertising is communication, we note that all of these laws would pertain to specific ideas and their units of meaning. Other psychological phenomena would, of course, subsequently be included within such explanations. Thus, explanations about advertising are, strictly speaking, explanations about psychological phenomena, and as such, are explanations about nonphysical phenomena. But the methodological problem consists in determining the validation of the experimental de- sign employed for measuring these phenomena. And, in the absence of predicting specific physical facts or events, the validity of the experimental design is never really determined, and indeed, allegations to the con- trary would necessarily involve a circular argument regarding the nature of the phenomenon the experi- mental design purported to measure. The same argument would hold, of course, for scientific explanations about consumer behavior. Since the basic assumption is that the consumer is a human being, i.e., not merely a biological organism, he possesses a mind whose contents (units of meaning, attitudes, etc.) exist as the causative agents of his behavior. Thus, it is this common interest in psychological phenomena that brings advertising and consumer behavior together as natural partners for joint scien- tific investigation. From a scientific point of view, it is the basic reason why their individual explanations are mutually implicative. Advertising evaluation consists in measuring for the existence of specific psychologi- cal phenomena. But, the validation of the test instru- ment for measuring these psychological phenomena is best established by predicting specific physical behavior. A CRITICAL PROBLEM: VALIDATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN It is quite necessary to note that the validation of a given test instrument through prediction is preceded by the determinate isolation and identification of these specific psychological phenomena. This means that the validity of a test instrument also requires coherent hypotheses (definitions) about the phenom- ena that the test instrument purports to measure. And the reason why this is necessary is as follows. 16</page><page sequence="2">Everyone understands that validity is an index of a test's ability to measure what it purports to measure. But this property of the experimental design must necessarily entail the isolation and identification of that thing the test purports to measure, e.g., a specific unit of meaning or attitude. In other words, the validity of an experimental design exists - if it exists at all- because of the actual property of the experimental design to isolate and identify the specific psychologi- cal phenomenon for which it was constructed. Thus, any failure to produce a coherent hypothesis (defini- tion) of a specific unit of meaning or attitude prevents the subsequent construction of a test instrument that must necessarily be specifically designed to isolate and identify the specific unit of meaning or attitude which is sought after. Therefore, as researchers, and unless we are to degenerate in science to the circularity of anthro- pomorphic psychology, it is quite necessary to recog- nize that the validity of a test instrument for use in the measurement of an experimental unknown, requires, absolutely, a coherent hypothesis (definition) regard- ing the nature of that unknown. The point is that we cannot expect to construct an experimental design that will isolate and identify something for which we have not yet discriminated from a plurality of n-possible phenomena. By failing to discriminate by hypotheses amongst a plurality of n-possible phenomena, the scope of intention of the data generated by experimental designs void of hypotheses would actually be inclusive of the undis- criminated plurality of n-possible phenomena. Specif- ically, therefore, any allegation made from such data regarding the isolation and identification of a given unit of meaning or attitude would be question begging. Thus, it is a necessary condition for the validation of any test instrument that it be able to isolate and identify the specific unit of meaning or attitude it purports to measure. In this regard, it is noted that so-called statistical "laws" fail to satisfy this condi- tion, and therefore, from a scientific point of view, it is question begging to talk about prediction in con- junction with such "laws." PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES AND THEIR PHYSICAL EFFECTS In order to coherently explain consumer behavior, it is a necessary condition that the causal agents (i.e., causal determinants) of behavior be isolated and identified. Thus, Cohen remarks ' . . . where we do not isolate a single determinant we cannot expect to find a determinate relation" (1). Assuming that the consumer possesses a mind, that he is able to think, make choices between competing products, etc., it follows that these causal agents are all in his mind. In other words, the consumer makes his purchases on the basis of the information (units of meaning) he possesses in his mind at a given time about a given product or service. In advertising, these causal agents are currently called ''psychographics." Units of mean- ing (information) is one of them; attitudes, beliefs, etc., are others. It is important to note that it is by means of adver- tising that a company can exercise some type of con- trol over the kind of information (units of meaning) that a potential customer might ultimately possess. This implies that the most reliable way the advertiser can provide information about his products or services is by means of advertising. Hence, the most reliable way an advertiser can explain consumer behavior would be in relation to his advertising. In other words, since advertising is communication, a true under- standing of the nature of communication would con- stitute a sufficient antecedent condition for a coher- ent explanation of consumer behavior.

Note also, in the absence of advertising, 7. that the consumer possesses no information about new product X, or if he has heard about it, it had to be by some kind of word of mouth vehicle or seen at the point of sale. In either case, predicted sales cannot be reliably made, and, consumer be- havior, if any, cannot be reliably explained. 17</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL of ADVERTISING 8. that demographic information about the potential consumer does not provide any information about what he thinks about new product X. Therefore, predicted sales cannot be reliably made, and, consumer behavior, if any, cannot be reliably explained, 9. that the economic risks involved are extremely high. We also notice that when a product is marketed in two different areas - one with advertising and the other without advertising - that the area with adver- tising generally has the greater sales. In other words, it pays to advertise. But the point is that if this is the extent of our interest in advertising, then the issue is begged as to what it was about the advertising that caused the increase in sales. In terms of gaining pre- dictive knowledge about given advertisements and commercials we are effectively restricted operation- ally to the level of trial and error. And, among other things, this intellectual level of operation is extremely expensive. The point is that even though we know we can get increased sales by advertising, this fact does not tell us anything about the psychological consequences of the advertising that presumably caused the increase in sales. The fact is we still have not explained why the consumer purchased new product X, and, there- fore, we have not explained consumer behavior. The fact that a certain per cent of the target popu- lation purchased new product X is merely an economic statistic. Moreover, it is a detail given after the fact. Therefore, any explanation as to why the product was purchased has all the significance of 20-20 vision given in hindsight. Thus, while we know that advertis- ing will result in increased sales, we do not know why. In other words, at this point the advertiser is at that crossroad where he has to make a fundamental corporate decision. If he continues to take the "prac- tical" position that he does not care why consumers at time t2 purchased his products-just so long as they did! (i.e., so long as the advertising "produced results"), then at time t2 he cannot ask for coherent advertising evaluation research for the campaign involved at t1. At that point, the only explanation possible is an after the fact explanation - which is absolutely worthless from a scientific point of view, and, from an economic point of view. Moreover, to talk about pre-testing of campaigns, in the absence of a coherent analysis of the experi- mental designs employed, is simply question begging. It is almost platitudinous to say that consumer behavior can be reliably investigated in conjunction with advertising. But, it is a point of scientific meth- odology to say that it is a necessary condition that the causal determinants of consumer behavior be isolated and identified. And, unless the consumer is to be defined, implicitly or explicitly, as nothing more than a biological organism, then these causal determinants are all in his mind - a mind that has not been rede- fined in terms of neurophysiological phenomena. It is not possible - scientifically - to explain consumer behavior in hindsight. It is not possible - scientifi- cally - to explain consumer behavior in foresight when the test instruments employed possess theoret- ical presuppositions based in anthropomorphic empir- icism. We need to know a great deal more about the psychological phenomena that exist in the minds of potential customers. The rise of consumerism and the attacks against the communication arm of free enter- prise (advertising) have served only to dramatize the paucity of true knowledge about these phenomena. In this regard, government lawyers or politicians making allegations about agencies' abilities to measure the meanings of advertisements should be required to produce scientific substantiation of their claims in public - inclusive of' research methodology, experi- mental design, data, and a critique of the experiment by a researcher who knows the difference between a unit of meaning and its physical representation. In most cases, however, completely ignoring the scientific revolution now occurring in psychology, and completely ignoring the critical problems being mentioned by advertising and marketing researchers, such kinds of allegations are being permitted to go unsubstantiated -even in our own advertising and marketing media (3). The psychological theories and research tech- niques that we have been using for well over 40 years have simply not helped us in developing coherent marketing strategy and before the fact explanations of consumer behavior. The fact is that corporate deci- sions on next year's advertising budget are largely based on percentages of last year's sales coupled with anticipated forecasts of next year's sales - a purely economic decision that leaves begging any coherent explanation of the causative role of advertising in the marketing operation. Budget time for next year s ad- vertising expenditures is the moment of truth for the actual significance of last year's advertising research. Apparently to correct this situation, some adver- tisers have become more involved in the study of com- munication and the human sciences. Theyarechanging agencies more frequently, they are increasingly buying advertising services 6 la carte, they are pondering the feasibility of "house" agencies. The point is that advertisers have been reaching out for something better. By the early 1960's, adver- tisers had apparently learned that if they were ever to know something about consumer behavior - on a predictable basis, i.e., possess before the fact explana- tions - then they first had to know something about psychological phenomena. And before they could learn something about psychological phenomena, they would first have to learn something about that com- munication process which gives rise to these phenom- ena, namely, advertising. On my view, this is the fundamental reason why the advertiser is currently becoming more directly involved in the promotional aspects of his marketing 18</page><page sequence="4">Advertising and Consumer Behavior operation. Advertising is communication. It is com- munication about products and services. However, absorption of the advertising management function into the advertiser's own corporate structure will not n ecessa ri y so Ive ba s ic psyc h o log i ca I resea rc h prob le m s that are entailed in the measurement of human com- munication. In fact, if we look at actual case histories where the advertiser performs advertising-consumer behavior research himself, he generally uses the same anthropomorphic research test instruments employed elsewhere. And it must be noted, of course, that the sponsorship of this type of "research" by corporate managements who are otherwise intensely tough- minded and practical carries some rather serious implications regarding the social, political, and educational areas of our society. THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF ADVERTISING COMMUNiCATION While the advertising business involves many different areas-in fact, it is hard to imagine a more interdisciplinary subject matter - with direct respect to its communicative function, it is basically concern- ed with three things: 1. certain ideas and units of meaning existent in the mind of some creative artist, 2. advertisements and commercials employed to physically represent these ideas and units of meaning, 3. the mind of some consumer. THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF ADVERTISING COMMUNICA TION system of thought Ra system of explanation Rb system of thought (mind,) (mind2) t t t a specific creative a specific a specific consumer artist ad or commercial FIGURE 2 In Figure 2 we note that Ra and Rb are sources of error. We note also that consumer behavior, e.g., pur- chase behavior, lies in consequence of a specific con- sumer's system of thought regarding a specific product or service. This is extremely important because it spells out the economically significant sequence of events involving purchase behavior. Moreover, it spells out the sequence of priorities in knowledge to be acquired in explaining consumer behavior. And that sequence is this: Advertising -. Purchase Behavior -.-Profits Communication The variable degrees of success of each of these three factors - measured in isolation - should not be confused with the causative nature of the sequence as a whole. In other words, profits do not precede purchase behavior, nor does high level purchase be- havior precede successful advertising. NEEDED: A MORE ADEQUATE THEORY OF PSYCHOLOGY At this point we should begin to see that in order to explain consumer behavior, it is quite desirable to first understand the process of human communication. It is because of this that advertising can be described as the unifying factor in consumer decision models. It is only through his advertising that the advertiser has any controlled input on the consumer's psychologi- cal disposition regarding his products or services. Demographic information about a potential custo- mer does not provide any direct information about what that potential customer thinks about any given product or service. Because of this, predicted sales cannot be reliably made, and therefore, consumer behavior cannot be reliably explained. Demographics are not the causal agents of con- sumer behavior. Their significance to marketing con- sists in their affect upon the consumer's psychological disposition - his state of mind. Moreover, the adver- tiser has very little influence over the consumer's demographics, but may indeed have a direct and important influence upon the consumer's psychological disposition. This suggests, therefore, that the psycho- logical phenomena involved in communication are the most important variables that a company must learn to manage effectively in its marketing effort. The only possibility for a true explanation of con- sumer behavior is to possess a true explanation of the psychological properties of specific consumers. At- tempts by the advertiser to explain consumer behavior has been, and is today, largely a matter of guesswork (2). However, in order for the advertiser to progress beyond guessing what his potential customers are going to do, we will need to develop a more adequate theory of psychology for explaining psychological phenomena. A PRACTICAL QUESTION It becomes, therefore, an intensely practical question involving four likely areas where such psy- chological research might conceivably be encouraged. These areas consist of the university, the agency, the client, and government. The practical question is: which one, if any, will encourage basic research for discovering and develop- ing a theory of psychology valid for the human mind, i.e., valid for consumers, and valid for a mind that has not been redefined, implicitly or explicitly, in terms of neurophysiological phenomena? A LITTLE FACT FINDING WILL PROVIDE THE ANSWER A simple historical investigation of the type of psychological research sponsored, encouraged, and proclaimed to be "relevant" by each of these four areas within the last (say) 40 years should provide sufficient data for an answer. The investigation must be focused on the theoretical presuppositions involved</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL of ADVERTISING in the research projects that have been sponsored by these four areas. The critical point will depend on how each of the psychological phenomena are defined in the research projects, assuming (a) that they are defined at all, (b) that they are coherently defined, and (c) that they have not been equivocated into phy- sical phenomena within the experimental design. THE NATURE OF THE RELATION BETWEEN ADVERTISING AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR The basic problem of being able to explain con- sumer behavior, and therefore, being able to predict corporate profits, consists in not havir.g a coherent explanation of a specific consumer's psychological disposition. The relation between advertising and consumer behavior has been known for centuries as the mind- body problem. Unfortunately for the business com- munity, psychology has not even investigated the human consciousness for many decades. In fact, a perusal of some current psychological journals and some slick magazines will even show crude attempts to redefine genuine psychological phenomena in terms of neurophysiological phenomena. It is this particular situation in current psychology that is causing all kinds of problems in the business community. And as we move into a consumer orienta- tion in marketing, these problems, as even now, will be greatly magnified. Unfortunately, it is especially from psychology that we have inherited our current anthropomorphic research techniques and philosophy. Political and other social problems aside, the broad over-all research problem for the advertiser is being able to explain the diagram given in Figure 3. Since the turn of this century, in terms of genuine scientific research, we generally have been ignoring all three of these broad relations given in Figure 3. But, since the 1950's we have at least started to talk about such things as "cognitive factors," and, current- ly, "psychographic factors." And these are encourag- ing signs. But the fact is that much of our advertising research today is simply not valid for these "cognitive" or "psychographic" factors we purport to be measur- ing. Our test instruments have not been validated by implied physical behavior from the data they gener- ate. The search for and testing of inductively derived generalizations is normally not even considered. For example, we talk about the Theory of Cogni- tive Dissonance, but one of its experimental designs is some variant of the semantic differential - which is an anthropomorphic test instrument. Thus, while the terms "cognitive" and "semantic" are employed, what is actually inivolved is merely a nominal definition redefining these psychological phenomena in terms of physical phenomena. Thus, while the appearance of the consumer's humanness is maintained, the nature of his consciousness has been surreptitiously redefined. Any coherent investigation of the relation between advertising and consumer behavior begins with coherent definitions of the psychological phenomena purported to be the object of investigation. And, when a definition is offered, it is critical that no equivocation occurs within the definition between mental and neu- rophysiological phenomena. And, subsequently, as- suming that a psychological phenomenon has actually been defined coherently, it is equally critical that it has not been equivocated into physical phenomena within the experimental design. Finally, in scientific research we search to discover causality relations - not statistical correlations be- tween unidentified, undiscriminated, grouped phenom- ena. It is the case that the isolation and identification of discrete psychological phenomena is a necessary condition for any coherent explanation of the adver- tising-consumer behavior relation.
