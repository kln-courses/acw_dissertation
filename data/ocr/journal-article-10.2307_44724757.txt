General Motors Research Laboratories ABSTRACT The Cal3D simulation program was used to study the interaction between the belt restraint systems and a Hybrid III dummy in two sled tests. The elastic proper- ties of the dummy joints and thorax were obtained from static tests. The two belt algorithms in the Cal3D pro- gram were compared and simulation results indicated that the "harness model", which utilizes multi-segment representation for the belt is more suitable than the "simple belt model", which has only one fixed point on the torso. Simulating a frontal impact of a lap belt restrained dummy indicated that the dummy motion consists of two distinct phases; a forward translation followed by a rotation. During forward translation the belt is primarily in contact with the abdomen while dur- ing rotation the belt is interacting with the upper legs. For a lap and shoulder belt restrained dummy, consid- erable head acceleration was induced by chin/chest im- pact. The flexibility of the neck also has a significant effect on the magnitude of this impact. Exercising the model indicated that shoulder belt alone is not sufficient to prevent submarining and proper anchor point loca- tion is important to achieve adequate torso restraint. It was also found that a stiffer belt system would re- duce head acceleration and excursion, rib deformation and chest viscous response, but induce higher spine and sternal accelerations. THE USE OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL to simu- late occupant impact response has become an important facet of vehicle design and safety improvement within GM in recent years. Simulation will provide not only a fundamental understanding of the impact phenomenon but it also will alleviate the tremendous work involved in conducting tests. CAL3D[1] * has been one of the major * Numbers in brackets designate references at end of paper. simulation tools used at GM. This program, developed by the Calspan Corporation in the early seventies, mod- els the occupant as rigid body segments connected by joints, and the vehicle interior by contact planes with prescribed force-deflection properties. It also has mod- eling capabilities for the commonly used restraint de- vices such as seat belts and airbags. Due to its versatile modeling capabilites and the necessity to examine the occupant response in three dimensional fashion, there has been a significant increase of interest in this pro- gram in the past few years. Since anthropomorphic dummies have been used as standard test devices in vehicle safety evaluation, most simulation attempts in the automotive industry were also geared toward reproducing the dummy impact re- sponse. Although this type of modeling is not a di- rect simulation of the human response, it still provides valuable information on the occupant impact mechan- ics since these test dummies were designed to possess certain human-like behavior. The most advanced test dummy for the frontal impact is the Hybrid III dummy[2], which has a number of improvements in biofidelity over the previous Part 572 dummy. This investigation will use the Cal3D program to examine the interaction be- tween the seat belt and the occupant in frontal sled impact. Two sled tests with belted Hybrid III dummys were simulated with these mathematical models. The first test has a lap belt restraint and the second test has both the lap and shoulder belt restraints. MODEL DESCRIPTIONS THE HYBRID III DUMMY MODEL - The Hybrid III dummy is modeled by connected rigid segments rep- resenting the head, the neck, the thorax, the pelvis and the limbs. Table 1 contains the weight and moments of inertia of these body segments. The weight is obtained from measuring a disassembled Hybrid III dummy. The moments of inertia were obtained by referring to the measured data of the Hybrid II dummy in Reference 1 4.688 0096-736X/89/9704-0688$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">880648 and adjusted according to the weight difference of each body segment. In order to avoid unnecessary computa- tion, a number of small body segments of the Hybrid III dummy did not have a corresponding counterpart in the model. Instead, they were lumped into the adjacent segments. Such parts included the lumbar spine, the feet, the lower arms and the hands. The mass of the lumbar spine was lumped into the lower and the upper torso with two equal parts. The flexibility was repre- sented by a joint between the lower and upper torso. The feet were lumped with the lower legs, and the lower arms and the hands were combined with the upper arms since the relative motion between these segments is not considered to be important. These simplifications led to a substantial reduction in computation time, which allowed the model fine-tuning to be performed more ef- fectively. The static characteristics of the Hybrid III neck structure were tested previously and the results have been used to construct two neck models [3]. The first model utilized a rigid segment representation primarily to reproduce the head kinematics observed in minisled tests. In the second model, the flexibility of the neck structure was incorporated in a multi-segment repre- sentation with the intention to not only mimic the head motion but also the neck response. These models were adopted as part of the dummy representation in this study. Due to recent safety concerns on the chest deflec- tion response from the shoulder belt load, a thorax model was developed to provide additional information such as the rib deformation and the viscous response [4], Figure 1 depicts the Hybrid III dummy thorax struc- ture. It consists of a rigid thoracic spine and a rib cage. Figure 1.

The Hybrid III Dummy Thorax Model for Frontal Impact The construction is based on force-deflection corridors developed from frontal pendulum impacts on cadaver thorax[2]. The instrumentation in the dummy thorax usually includes a triaxial accelerometer attached on the thoracic spine, a uniaxial accelerometer on the sternum and a deflection gauge between the sternum and the thoracic spine. Parallel to the thorax structure, the model also consists of two segments simulating the spine and the rib cage as shown in Figure 2. These two seg- ments were connected by a joint located at the CG of the spine segment. In order to simulate the rib deformation, these two segments were allowed to have relative trans- lation along a slip line indicated in Figure 2. A spring and damper set was positioned between these two seg- ments to simulate the chest compliance. Quasi-static tests were performed to the thorax structure to obtain its elastic characteristics due to a diagonal shoulder belt load. It appears that a linear spring would sufficiently mimic the loading curve of the test response as shown in Figure 3. The viscous coefficients in the model were adjusted in the simulation process such that the model response conformed to the sled test results. In order to model the flexibility of the lumbar spine, a test device was constructed to obtain the moment- rotation relationship. In this test, the base of the lum- bar spine was rigidly mounted on a vertical structure and a four-foot long beam was attached to the top of the lumbar spine for applying the moment. Pure bend- ing was achieved by use of cable and pulleys to generate equal but opposite force at the two ends of the beam. The pulleys were allowed to move along horizontal slots until the cable is perpendicular to the bending beam on the lumbar spine. Within 30 degrees of rotation, a linear rotational spring constant, as shown in Figure 4, seems to be a reasonable representation for the test result. 4.689</page><page sequence="3">Model 600 - y/ 500 " // / ss / Test 400 - // / a 300 - // / I 200 - 100 - ^ s' 1 1 I L_ °- 0-5 l. 1.5 2.

The Hybrid III Dummy Lumbar Spine Char- acteristics The mechanical properties of the Hybrid III dummy limb joints have never been tested. However, since the test dummy is restrained in a sitting position in the sled test, the major concerns in this study will be the kinematics of the head, the neck, the chest, and the pelvis. The motion of the limbs is considered to be less important; thus, the spring constants for the limb joints were only estimated based on the test data of the Hybrid II dummy.

The Harness Model in CAL3D THE BELT MODEL - The CAL3D program pro- vides two options for modeling the belt - an original belt model and a more sophisticated "harness model" [5] de- veloped at a later time. The original belt model consists of two anchor points and a fixed point on the segment el- lipsoid surface. The plane defined by these three points intersects the segment ellipsoid with an ellipse. Two tangent points are located on this ellipse to form the belt configuration. The belt length is computed from the fixed point to each of the anchor points. The friction between the belt and the contact surface can be either zero or infinite. For zero friction, the total belt length is used to determine the belt strain and the belt force. For infinite friction, the strain and the force are computed separately for the belt segments on each side of the fixed point. The belt force is always acting along the tangent directions. Notice that as the segment ellipsoid moves, the tangent points and the tangent directions are also changed on the ellipsoid surface. The second belt model was originally developed for simulating aircraft pilot restraint systems. However, the restraint can be configured into any desired fashion such as those used in the automobile. In CAL3D, a "harness" is defined to be a collection of "belts" which may be tied together in any fashion as shown in Figure 5.

The Force-Strain Relationship of the Belt Re- straint System is composed of linear segments and "reference points" on the ellipsoid surface. The belt strain and force are computed independently for each linear segment and a force vector is then computed at each reference point from the tension of the adjacent belt segments. The reference points can move on the ellipsoid surface to achieve a balance between the belt force and the fric- tion. This is accomplished by first establishing a carte- sian coordinate system at the reference point along the " belt line direction" , the " perpendicular direction" and the "normal direction", as illustrated in Figure 5. The belt line direction is parallel to a line determined by the two adjacent reference points. The normal direction is pointing into the ellipsoid surface and the perpendicu- lar direction is tangent to the surface. The belt force at the reference point is decomposed along these directions and the friction force is obtained from the normal force and the coefficients of friction€ The reference points are relocated until the belt force in the other two directions is smaller than the friction force as illustrated in Figure 5. In addition, provisions were also made for the ref- erence points to penetrate into the body segments if a force-deflection relationship is given for the contact sur- face. This harness model appears to have more capabil- ities compared to the original belt model. However, no applications of this development in the Cal3D program have been reported in the literature. 0 ms 20 ms 40 ms 60 ms 80 ms 100 ms 120 ms 140 ma 160 ma 180 ms 200 ma Figure 7. Simulation of Sled Test 1 Using the Simple Version Belt Routine A quasi-static test was conducted using a piece of webbing material to obtain the force-strain characteris- tics of the belt. The webbing exhibited slightly strain- softening behavior as shown in Figure 6. However, dur- ing sled test the belt appeared to undergo considerably more geometry change than the webbing stretch as indi- cated by high speed film analysis data. This implies that the compliance of other parts of the restraint system such as the anchor deformation or the belt spool-out from the retractor is also significant. Since these mech- anisms are not seperately modeled in this simulation, it is more appropriate to use a force-strain relationship that would include these effects. A bi-linear function, as illustrated in Figure 6, is a simplified representation of the film analysis results. TEST SIMULATION AND OBSERVATIONS LAP BELT RESTRAINED TEST - As indicated in the Introduction, two test runs performed on a HYGE sled at the Biomedical Science Department of GMR were selected for the modeling task. The first test is a two-dimensional run in which the dummy was re- strained by a lap belt with both feet tied to the floor of the sled fixture. A 15G acceleration pulse with about 120 ms duration was applied to the sled in the dummy posterior direction, causing the dummy to flex to sim- ulate the automobile frontal impact condition. The ac- celeration profile was digitized and used as input to the seat to excite the model. The first attempt was to use the original belt model by defining two anchor points and a fixed point on the pelvis. Simulation results indi- cated that the dummy pelvis motion actually consists of two phases: a forward translation followed by a rotation. As illustrated in Figure 7, the forward motion persisted for about 80 ms until the extreme position was reached due to the belt restraint. During this phase, no signif- icant flexion was observed in the upper torso. Beyond this point, the torso started to rotate with the pelvis as the pivot point. In addition, the pelvis and the legs were also experiencing a rotation with the feet as the pivot 4.691</page><page sequence="5">0 ms 20 m3 40 ms 60 ms 80 ms 100 ms V¿3| Vs^ 'g^ 'gg^ 120 ms 140 ms 160 ms 180 ms 200 ms Figure 8.

Lap Belt Force of Sled Test 1 points, which causes the pelvis to move upward. This motion would move the tangent point locations on the pelvis closer to the fixed point until they coincide. The belt force generated at the tangent points were not suf- ficient to restrain the leg rotation and the pelvis upward motion as illustrated in Figure 7. Review of the test films revealed that the belt re- mained above the upper legs throughout the impact event and substantial interactions between the belt and the upper legs appeared to exist, which limit the leg ro- tation and the upward motion of the pelvis. These ob- servations suggested that using one fixed point on the pelvis is not an effective scheme to fully describe the belt/dummy interaction. On the other hand, the har- ness routine does have the provision for specifying the reference points on various segments such as the pelvis and the upper legs, and generating force at these loca- tions. Thus, in the next attempt, the belt was modeled using the harness algorithm with three reference points on the pelvis and one reference point on each of the upper legs. Indeed, the model now exhibited a more realistic gross motion as portrayed in Figure 8. * Arrows indicating the 40 ms ticks for the simulation response 8 Of 60 - ü 40 " :ļ ' I 20" £ -20' i 1 1 1 1 0 i 40 80 120 160 200 ms * 20. 0 " - ^ t -60- 1 0) a o -80 - w -loo H 1 1 ' o 1 40 80 120 160 200 ms 100 - * 8Ó - o 60 - ft .v c 40 ' / r v ? 20 " V o '"TV^ ~ -20 rJ 1 1 1 0 140 80 120 160 200 ms Tine Solid s Test Deshed « Simulation Figure 10. Head Acceleration of Sled Test 1 The comparison for the belt force response between the test and the simulation is shown in Figure 9. The test data exhibited two distinct peaks with approxi- mately the same magnitude. It can be deduced from the above observations that the first peak occurred when the dummy reached the extreme position of its forward translation and the second peak occurred when the dummy reached the extreme position of its rotation. The simulation results have similar trends as the test data but with a less prominent unloading part between the two peaks. The force magnitude and response du- ration in the model is quite close to the test data. The head acceleration of this run is shown in Figure 10. The positive directions are pointing to the posterior and the superior directions of the head in a local reference frame. The peak acceleration in the posterior direction is a re- sult of contact between the head and the knees.

Chest Acceleration of Sled Test 1 overall comparison appears to be favorable except some timing difference. This discrepancy may be due to the slight difference in dummy initial position between the model and the test. However, since the major concern in head injury assessment is the acceleration magnitude and duration, no further effort was made to adjust this difference. Figure 11 depicts the chest acceleration com- parison between the test and the simulation. The cor- relation is also reasonable except for a distinct spike at about 135 ms in the test result. This spike, with totally different characteristics compared to other portion of the curve, is believed to be unrelated to the whole chest response. One possible explanation is the vibration of the accelerometer mounting surface. It should be pointed out that although the harness model appears to have yielded better simulation results, it was found that the slip algorithm for the reference points did not function properly. Thus, all the reference points are fixed on the ellipsoid surface in the current * Arrows indicating the 40 ms ticks for the simulation response 16l Shoulder 12 - ; M «- /' ' M / A S * y o y ' * o -4 L- 1 « 1 0 4 0 * 80 120 160 200 ms * Time 20 16 - LaP o / '' 0 A - / '' ^ A - I '' ' fcu 0 -4 h 1 1 ' 0 40® 80 120 160 200 ms * Time Solid t Test Dashed : Simulation Figure 12. Belt Force of Sled Test 2 model. This limitation did not seem to be a significant drawback for the test case being considered here. This seems to imply that either small amount of belt slip is present in this particular test or its effect on the dummy kinematics is not significant. However, under other cir- cumstances belt slip may be an important factor. LAP/SHOULDER BELT RESTRAINED TEST - The second model in this study involves a frontal im- pact sled test with 25G acceleration pulse of about 90 ms duration. The test dummy was restrained by both the lap and the shoulder belts. The lap harness model developed from previous test was extended to incorpo- rate the shoulder belt with three reference points on the chest. Figure 12 illustrated the comparison of the belt force response between the test and the simulation. The lap belt force measured in the test was between the belt buckle and the anchor point. Thus, this force is the vec- tor sum of the shoulder belt force and the lap belt force acting on the buckle. The correspondence between the test and the simulation is considered to be favorable. 4.693</page><page sequence="7">* Arrows indicating the 40 ms ticks for the simulation response 80 Z 60 - -20 « , « 1 0 40 1 80 120 160 200 ms * 20. oj -60- a V " -eo. -loo' 1 , « &gt; « 0 40 ' 80 120 160 200 ms * 10 Of 80- e&gt; 60 - / ' « 0 -20 1 j 1 « 1 0 40 ļ j 60 120 160 200 ms Time Test w/o Additional Ellipsoid Rigid Neck Flexible Neck Figure 13. Head Acceleration of Sled Test 2 Figure 13 shows the head acceleration in the posterior, superior directions and the resultant. In the test, the peak at about 110 ms in the posterior direction is due to the impact from the chin to the chest. This impact was not reproduced in the model initially as shown in Fig- ure 13. This is because the contact ellipsoid attached to the rib cage would translate with the rib cage in the posterior direction. This translation, although giving a good indication of the rib deformation, did not reflect the correct position for the upper portion of the chest structure which the chin is impacting on. This part of the structure has little deformation and thus, is more properly modeled by a second ellipsoid attached to the thoracic spine. Although a chin/chest impact was in- duced by this additional ellipsoid, the head acceleration response was still somewhat less than the test data when the rigid neck model was used initially as indicated in Figure 13.

This may be due to the fact that the flexibility of this neck model gives more realistic head trajectories and kinematics which are important for this particular impact. Figure 13 also illustrated that the predicted head acceleration in the inferior direction is approxi- mately 35 percent less than the test result. The reason of this discrepancy is still not clear. Figures 14-16 depict the chest response for the spine acceleration, the sternal acceleration and the rib deformation. The comparison appears to be satisfactory. To further examine the occupant/belt interaction, some variations were incorporated into this lap and shoul- der belt restrained model. The first variation was in- tended to examine the effectiveness of the shoulder belt alone. The lap belt restraint was removed from the model to form a two-point shoulder belt restraint sys- tem.

Chest Deflection of Sled Test 2 eration pulse used in the previous test. As shown in Figure 17, simulation result indicated that shoulder belt alone does not provide sufficient constraint to prevent submarining. It should be noted that although the ref- erence points for defining the harness system can not slip at this stage of the development, it is still possible to make a judgement on whether occupant submarining is going to happen or not. However, the occupant kine- matics subsequent to submarining may not be valid in the model prediction. In the second variation the effect of shoulder belt position on the occupant chest is examined. In this sim- ulation, the upper anchor point of the shoulder belt is relocated to a lower and more outboard position which would be considered an improper design. Simulation re- sults did indicate that with this belt configuration, the occupant has a tendency to pitch out of the shoulder belt restraint when impact occurs. Thus, this model can be used to examine the acceptable anchor point se- lection in the design process. Figure 17. Submarining From Two-Ppint Shoulder Belt Restraint In the final variation, the belt stiffness in the model is increased. Since the belt force-strain relationship used in the model includes the retractor spool-out, the stiffness increase does not necessarily imply the web- bing stiffness. Instead, it could represent a retractor mechanism with less belt spool-out or some type of belt pretensioner. Table 2 listed the relevant occupant re- sponse and belt force for the baseline run and cases of doubling and quadrupling the belt force-deflection function. The last column listed the percentage change for the case of quadrupling the belt stiffness compared to the baseline run. A stiffer belt would lower the head acceleration and the HIC value. It would also reduce both the vertical and horizontal displacements and thus, the possibility of impacting the vehicle in- terior. However, the chest response indicated that a stiffer belt would increase the sternal and spinal accel- eration although the rib deformation and the viscous re- sponse(VC) are reduced. This result is associated with the damping element in the chest model. A stiffer belt can induce a more abrupt stop to the thorax forward motion; which leads to higher force in the damping ele- ment with less amount of stroke (deformat ion). Finally, the anchor point force shows an increase which implies 4.695</page><page sequence="9">stronger design is required when the belt system is stiff- ened. Although these model predictions have not yet been verified by test results, the general trends seem to be intuitively reasonable. CONCLUSIONS This work has demonstrated that simulation is an effective tool to complement the test for understanding the occupant impact response and the mechanisms of the belt restraint system. A mathematical representa- tion of the Hybrid III dummy was established in this study which correlates well with the test data for the gross motion of the dummy. It was found that the lap belt can not be represented by merely one point on the pelvis due to its interaction with both the the pelvis and the legs in limiting the torso forward translation and ro- tation. This finding led to the conclusion that the "har- ness model" algorithm is a better approach than the "simple belt model" in the Cal3D program. The belt slip on the dummy segment does not appear to have a significant effect on the kinematics of the tests consid- ered in this study. However, under different impact con- ditions such as the out-of-position occupant or oblique impact, the belt slip may be an important factor. A number of parameter studies were conducted using the model to address some belt design considerations and useful information about the occupant response trends were obtained from the simulation.
