Bound up amidst Peiresc's copies of his letters to the Paduan antiquary Lorenzo Pignoria from the winter of 1615-16 is a text of four sides entitled, in large letters, "Delli Popoli della China" and continuing, in smaller ones, "written by P. Ioannes Pietro Maffei History of the Indies, Fr. Antonio di Saint Roman, in the History of the East Indies, Fr. Juan Gonzalez de Men- doza Augustino, in the books on China, and others."' The reading notes I The text, found in Carpentras, Bibliotheque Inguimbertine, MS 1875, fols. 304-7 (fols. 304-5 in a secretary's fair hand, fols. 306-7 in Peiresc's original) is undated, but appears between letters of 28 October 1615 (fol. 301r) and 4 January 1616 (308r). However, it is not always the case that organization of Peiresc's papers is by Peiresc himself. On the other hand, in his letter to Pignoria of 4 January 1616 (309v), Peiresc comments having time to page through ("di transcorrere un poco") Maffei, Gonzales and Saint Roman where he found some information about figures they had discussed, and also about artifi- cial grottoes used for domestic refrigeration, "which I did not note from when I had read it the first time" ("di che non m'ero accordo quando l'havevo letto prima"). These all provide a fairly firm terminus ad quem for Peiresc's reading, but no more. Nor can we be entirely sure that these notes date from the latest reading, or the earlier one.

At this stage of Peiresc's thinking at least, history of religion seems interchangeable with ethnography. In his letter to Pignoria of 4 January 1616, Peiresc acknowledges hav- ing time to page through ("di transcorrere un poco") Maffei, Gonzales, and Saint Roman where he found some information about figures they had discussed, and also about artificial grottoes used for domestic refrigeration, "which I did not note when I read it the first time." He asked if Pignoria wouldn't mind inquiring as to whether there was a more precise impression of a particular Chinese plaque or medallion-Pignoria had sent him one but Peiresc pronounced it "not as exact as I would like."2 Peiresc begins with the gods that were worshipped (these included de- ceased parents and friends, as well as the occasional living person) and auguries. This then leads to mention of the clothing and hair styles of those priests making offerings to the gods. Some of this information was derived from that octagonal medallion. Peiresc also noted down the presence of a vase, as if for libation, and other instruments for offerings. These authors, he continued, observed that the Chinese revered the God of Heaven above all the others. Peiresc recorded that Gonzalez men- tioned that he was indicated by use of the first letter of the alphabet, that this character looked a bit like "AF," that it was called "Guant," that he was honored with a solemn festival every near year, at the new moon in March, with vocal and instrumental music during which his priests applied themselves for an entire day to a board groaning with meat, poultry, fish, and fruits (no wonder the earlier reference to the gluttony of the priests). For the greater veneration of the King he was called the "Son of Heaven." Mention of the King led to discussion of the monthly festivals in the provinces when priests bore a portrait of the King, on gold, through the streets with great reverence. But then, citing from Maffei, Peiresc proceeded to jot down observations made about Chinese seaside towns and the do- mestic interior. This, in turn, led to some observations about dining-and, therefore, feasting-practices. Finally, Peiresc returned to the aforementioned medallion, whose de- tails now seemed to him to represent just such an honorific feast. But he was especially interested in the practice of indicating the name of God with a single Chinese character, or cipher. This reminded him, he wrote, that the 2 Peiresc to Pignoria, 4 January 1616, Carp., Bibl.

He went on to observe that this "religion or sect" spread widely in the eastern lands (probably meaning the eastern Mediterranean and Levant) and "embraced a large part of the Egyptian mysteries and superstitions." Through this religion, Peiresc wrote in the draft version of the essay, many Egyptian customs could have passed to the Far East.3 In the finished version, Peiresc added one crucial element to an Egypto- genetic argument otherwise like that of Pignoria, who made it as early as 1615 in his additions to Cartari's Imagini degli dei de gli antichi. Peiresc wrote that the Basilidians embraced many Egyptian superstitions "which easily could have been introduced and insinuated, over time, with some patina of Christianity, even to China, Japan, and Mexico, many centuries after the dissipation of this most ancient and grand Egyptian Empire."4 It would not be until Athanasius Kircher's Prodromus Coptus of 1636 that anyone would suggest that the presence of anything Egyptian in China could be a function of Christianity, rather than some pre-historic cultural encounter.s Peiresc lamented the defects of the drawing from which he was work- ing-in particular ruing the artist's inability to distinguish between the gold and black of the original by using only black ink-and left it up to Pignoria to decide if the artist could do better. Perhaps, Peiresc added, more useful information could be found in the books on China that were now arriving, "and perhaps in that new history of P. Trigault, of the most recent Frank- furt fair and which I have not yet seen."6 As Trigault's book was published in 1615, these words must have been written at the end of that year or the very beginning of 1616.7 The notes end with description of an ivory idol with gold (or gold-plate) and silver decoration. What ethnography there is here-what Peiresc signified by "Popoli della China"-is entirely circumscribed within an account of Chinese reli- " . con la religione de' quali perche possino essera ancora passate nell'ult.o oriente molti mysterii et superstitioni Egittie, molti secoli doppo la dissipatione di quel grand' Imperio Egyttio Antiquiss.o" 4 "La Religion o setta di quali prevalse molto ne paesi orientali &amp; abbracio gran parte de' Misterii &amp; superstitioni Egittiache, lequali facilmente potrebbono essersi con successi di tempo insinuate &amp; introdotte con qualche ombra del Christianesimo, sino a la China, Giappone &amp; Mexico, molti secoli doppo la dissipatione di quell'antiquissimo Imperio Egittiaco tanto grande."

Peiresc could have picked much else out of his reading. He could also have given his reading notes a different filing title. That in 1615 he put them together as he did, history of religion-religion as conceptualized, practiced, and represented-described as ethnography, suggests one rela- tionship that needs to be pondered. That he did not frame his discussion in terms of idolatry suggests another. II. Peiresc's intellectual career, especially after he returned to Provence for good in the autumn of 1623, provides ample additional material for study- ing the evolving relationship between history of religions and the study of peoples. His continuing fascination with the Basilidian gnostics and Eastern Christianity, to choose only two examples, kept these questions alive. But it is probably in Peiresc's letters to Africa that the role of religion in an evolving ethnographic discourse can be examined to best advantage. Peiresc had three correspondents with whom he talked about Africa: Thomas d'Arcos in Tunis, Zacharie Vermeil "at the Imperial Court" in Abyssinia, and Father Colombin de Nantes, a Capuchin living in France between missions to the Guinea coast. Peiresc exchanged the most letters, for the longest period, with d'Arcos, a humanist secretary taken prisoner by the corsairs and then turned renegade. Desirous of finding some place in the Republic of Letters he kept up a steady stream of letters to Peiresc and, apparently, also sent a series of manuscript treatises-none of which I have managed to locate. Much of the correspondence between Peiresc and d'Arcos circled around the latter's proposed "Relation d'Affrique"--what Peiresc called "vostre Histoire primitive." The "Relation" was itself a subject of major discussion, reflecting as it did a persistent object of Peiresc's curiosity. It was designed to report on the human population of Africa. Peiresc pursued at length the question of clothing and, in particular, the headgear worn by Muslim kings. Peiresc was interested in any possible link to ancient Greek crowns, and to Parthian and Armenian turbans.8 But in the "Relation" Peiresc was most excited by the resemblance be- 8 "Que si vous avez quelque notice particuliere de l'origine et progrez de l'usage des tur- bans, vous m'obligerez grandement de m'en faire part ... ."

Peiresc's generally omnivo- rous curiosity was here focused on those areas where he thought some evi- dence was forthcoming. "I beseech you," he continued, "to inquire into it and dig as deeply as you could with the most ample instructions, because I find among them so many vestiges of the moeurs of our ancient Gauls that I think that a truthful relation of their life and moeurs would be almost the same as our old Gauls."9 Not that d'Arcos should imagine that he was simply off on an etymological flight of fancy, launched by the similar sounds of the words. Peiresc assured him that there were many other more substantial grounds on which to support this kind of analogy.lo He refers specifically to the evidence of coins." Peiresc's comment reflects his examination of Gallic coins made, so he thought, after those of Philip of Macedon, and recorded in a thirty-odd- page manuscript with the filing title "GALLIAE COMATAE."'12 The com- parative premise is based on a historical reality and a trans-historical one: the fact of commerce between Macedonia and the Celts and the general prin- ciple that less civilized people imitated the coins of their more civilized neigh- bors in order to facilitate trade.13 The very thought of a Gallo-Macedonian koine--and there were indeed contacts, as early as 335 BCE, with a Macedo- nian embassy traversing Pannonia, of the eastern Gauls-suggests, from a material basis, the same interest in the origins of Europe, that Peiresc also pursued through the history of language (Phoenician-Greek-Etruscan). Eighty-four coins are commented upon in this document, of both gold and silver, most of them from the collection of "M. Bigot a Rouen," and their obverses and reverses are carefully, and in some cases minutely, de- scribed. In each and every case, it is the hairstyle of the head portrayed on the obverse that draws Peiresc's attention.14 These are the coins known now 9Peiresc to d'Arcos, 25 January 1634, Lettres de Peiresc, 7: 122. 1( Peiresc to Arcos, 3 August 1634, Lettres de Peiresc, 7: 136.

Peiresc suggested that the comparison of practices could bridge different periods- precisely the nature of their African project. He urged d'Arcos to note whenever possible the particular features signalled by Peiresc "and to make the comparison with other peoples of past centuries, as well as with those of the present one in diverse countries of the Earth."22 Peiresc then turned to those points of detail upon which he thought an illuminating comparison between the ancient Gauls and the African Galli could be based. The particular aspects that he focused on present a picture of a historical anthropology as it was practiced in the seventeenth century. He thought, in particular, that practices of mounting horses and shooting while mounted, styling hair, worshipping trees, drinking from the skulls of enemies killed in battle, face-painting, wearing of arm-, neck-, and leg bands, use of black clay vases, trial by fire, and burial with arms all told for some kind of common descent. Minimal commerce with more civilized peoples helped preserve the old customs in their new, African environ- ment.2" At the end of this long list, Peiresc turned to the use of skulls as cups. ... even the custom of drinking with two hands, but principally of drinking from the skull of the head of their enemies, is one of the most remarkable observations that could be made and is truly damasquineries mais ce qui estoit par dessus au droict du front est rompu, qui eust este possible le plus beau et la plus notable.

Colombin had travelled the Guinea coast from present-day Liberia down to Cap Lopez on the way to the Congo and Archbishopric of Angola. He had made landfall in three kingdoms, Liberia, Oublibata (Oulabata accord- ing to Leo Africanus) and Benin.26 In his letter to their mutual friend, the Capuchin Gilles de Loches, Colombin praised the extraordinary goldsmith work in those parts-"some golden ribbons of the work of those Negros, marvelously well done, and as delicately done as any goldsmith of France could have" and asked de Loches for some devotional images and relics. He explained that "if I return to these lands it will help me in many ways with the inhabitants of the lands." He did not explain here how exactly Christian devotional material would help him in West Africa, but he does so in a later letter to Peiresc.27 The connection having been made by Father de Loches, Peiresc wrote to Colombin on 10 April 1634. The letter commenced, characteristically, 24 Peiresc to d'Arcos, 25 January 1634, Lettres de Peiresc, 7: 123. 25 D'Arcos's "Relation" seems to have disappeared. But we do possess an untitled docu- ment in Peiresc's files concerning the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. It is a memorandum based in part, and perhaps in large measure, on a conversation with Jean Magy, Peiresc's agent in Cairo. 26 The voyages of P&amp;re Colombin, and his exchange with Peiresc are mentioned neither in histories of the European penetration of West Africa in the early modern period, such as Walter Rodney, A History of the Upper Guinea Coast 1545-1800 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1970), nor in accounts of the Cappuchin missions to West Africa, such as Mateo de Anguiano, Misiones capuchinas en Africa, 2 vols. (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Instituto Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, 1950); P. Rocco da Cesinale, Storia delle missioni dei cappuccini, 3 vols. (Paris: P. Lethielleux, 1867-73). The latter (3: 487) does mention the decision of the Sacred Congregation of the Propa- ganda Fide on 14 July 1634 to send a mission of French Cappuchins to Africa. They departed on 21 November and were away for three years. During the voyage, the superior died and Colombin took over. Father Colombin's final report was dated 7 August 1637. Peiresc had died on 24 June of that year. 27 P. Colombin de Nantes to P. Gilles de Loches, 24 February 1634, Carp.

It then proceeded to outline an extraor- dinarily detailed inquiry into the beliefs and practices of a distant but con- temporary people. Peiresc began with religion and ritual. He wanted to know about sacri- ficial ceremonies, liturgical formulae and their interpretation, whether liba- tions were used and, if so, with what sort of grain, what sort of liquid and what kind of cups. If they had any objects that were used in ritual, like the tripods of the Greeks, he dearly desired to obtain one, or at least its representation. In case of the latter he insisted, as ever, that the drawing should capture its true figure, measurements, and ornaments as well as comment on its use and employ. He desired information about the ritual calendar, and asked if there were sacred groves, and if the sun or stars were worshipped. He especially wanted a ritual book, if such existed, or even a transcription of relevant oral tradition. Again, as he did with d'Arcos, Peiresc insisted on the value of comparing the answers to these questions with what was known about other peoples from books. "It would be a great pleasure to make the comparison with what survives to us of ancient paganism in our old books, in order to have better [grasped] their spirit." The clear implication is that knowledge from the field improved knowledge from books.28 28 cc... quelles sont les ceremonies de cez peuples barbares idolastres en leurs sacriffices, et avoir les parolles formelles que prononce leur prestendu sacriffica[teur], avec l'inter- pretation d'icelles, et surtout quand y [sic] font les sacriffices des libations, qui ne sont que le milliet, ou autres semences, lesquelles ils mangent, comme aussi du vin ou autre breuvage dont ils heuzent [sic] en leurs boissons ordinaires; et savoir de quelle sorte de vases et de vaisselles ilz se servent pour faire les dites libations, et de quelle sorte d'autelz?

These two converged in funerary traditions, and Peiresc asked Father Colombin for "a little relation on the superstition of their burials." He was especially keen to know more about any custom of burying soldiers with their arms and ornaments. What weapons did they use and how did they array themselves for battle? He had heard that they used javelins and went off to war in wheeled chariots. Was this true? As with d'Arcos, Peiresc devoted a whole section to detailed questions about ways in which people wore their hair, and how they kept these elaborate styles from being disturbed by sleep. It should come as no surprise that Peiresc concluded this line of inquiry with the remark that these practices "have their origins in the most distant antiquity."29 For him, ethnography was always in dialogue with archaeology. Like any contemporary student of ancient Rome, Peiresc wanted to know about the structures of everyday life. After religion, war, and personal grooming, he turned to entertainment and recreation. Here, too, explicit reference to Roman games of chance-playing with estragoles (astra- gales)-triggered the observation that this practice might have survived the long years more or less unchanged because of the isolation of African peo- ples and the presumed lack of long-distance trade. If the ancient game did survive, Peiresc had some specific questions he wanted answered: what names were given to the four sides of the die and what was their etymology, what was the extent of the resemblance to modern dice, and whether they were used for haruspication. He noted, of course, the possible resemblance to contemporary French children's games and repeated that these might have had "quite amusing origins in the best antiquity ... [and] founded in the most absurd mysteries of their idolatrous superstitions."30 It was in a passage devoted to the ceremonial elements of warfare, such as festive drinking, that Peiresc turned to the practice that had so caught his attention in the letters to d'Arcos, wanting to know about ... the vases which they use to drink during their most solemn feasts, principally those which are composed of the skulls of their enemies killed in war, whose heads were embalmed and accommo- mans, et en remarquer serieusement I'usaige et l'employ dans leur superstitions."

These were among the customs and "superstitions" of a people who lived in this region, called "Imbes Gallus Imbongalleus."31 These "Galli" also appear in the letters to Vermeil in Ethiopia; indeed, the natives of the Ethiopian highland are called "Galli." Peiresc wanted to know more about the customs of these people whom he believed descended once upon a time from the Gauls and especially of the legend that they drank from the skulls of enemies killed in battle.32 Peiresc paid special at- tention to the artificial means by which they altered their appearance- through clothing, hair style, and body art. His interest in their forms of worship and belief was motivated, of course, by curiosity, but also by the more common, late antique justification for studying religion historically: that knowledge of paganism was necessary in order to more easily make Christians of the heathen. Thus, it is no mere concidence that the same matters recurred in the letters to his three African correspondents. For they referred to the same people.

On the contrary, as Peiresc explained in that long letter to Father Colombin, he believed them "more jealous of their traditions than of their true history and the expansion of the limits of their empires."33 These peoples did lack a historical literature like Europe's. And they did possess a very different sense of what counted as worth remembering-not the politics and warfare that dominated the civil historiography revived in the Renaissance but the myth and ritual stud- ied by the antiquarianism also revived in the Renaissance. But what they preserved, they preserved tenaciously. The historian of another culture, Peiresc implied, had to learn to take seriously what that culture took seri- ously if he was to find anything other than a reflection in the mirror of time. We can see how much more supple is Peiresc's approach to the "Popoli dell'Africa" in 1634 than it had been to those of China twenty years earlier. In part, this reflects access to different kinds of source material. But what is so interesting is the way in which religion-still, of course, approached as a social phenomenon-takes its place alongside of other cultural phe- neomena, such as war, ornament, and play. Colombin's reply to this long letter was written on 20 June.34 It an- swers Peiresc's queries in full. It begins with the geography, flora, and fauna of the coast (as well as its different names) and then turned to its peoples. "To write about the nature and moeurs and ways of doing things of the inhabitants of these lands, I would say that just as there are a diversity of nations, kingdoms and provinces," it begins, "also their practices are diverse.3-" It is worth noting the use of the term moeurs to describe how people live. Their religion included solar as well as lunar deities, but also worship of trees, animals, and the devil. His oracles were consulted on a 33 "Dont la rencontre faict que je me suis rendu curieux d'aprendre ce qui s'en peult estre conserve parmi ces peuples barbares, plus jaloux de telle sorte de traditions que de leur vraye histoire et de l'ampliation des bornes de leurs empires." 34 Paris, B.N.

Father Colombin does not explain what he meant by "god" in this pagan setting, as opposed to "devil." But he does compare the psychology of these African devil wor- shippers to those in Europe who were also shocked back into their senses by the sight of the cross. Turning to the Kingdom of Benin, Colombin described a king who was worshipped as a god, and served by offerings of children every seven years. His subjects prostrated themselves before him, bore him in triumph, and built his palace. And yet, he added, of the kingdom of this minotaur, "these peoples are the most civilized and ordered [policis] of the coast." And they were also wealthy and industrious. Father Colombin mentioned in particu- lar their skilled wood-working and dyeing of cloths. Blue garments were reserved for the gentle. The contradiction between barbarism and civiliza- tion was left hanging.36 In the Kingdom of Oulabiata, the population was illiterate, so far as he could tell, but possessed of such extraordinary powers of recollection that he attributed to them a system of "artificial memory." Colombin was also able to provide some information concerning mili- tary matters because he had gone on maneuvers with the natives. His de- scription of their arms would have very much intrigued Peiresc. In combat they use great shields which cover them from head to toe and which are made of the skins of cattle woven in braids and within are a number of little bells which make noise when handled, and they know so well to manipulate them that it is a pleasure to watch them advance and retreat covering and uncovering them- selves with their shields when it is necessary for their defence or for attacking the enemy.37 He did not reply to Peiresc's questions about their games, but was able to shed ample light on the different hair styles that were used by the Africans. Others fix their hair into diverse figures, some making crowns, semi-circles, tufts; others have long hair which they dress and twirl 36 Paris, B.N. MS.

Those who are from the pays d'Or enrich them with little spangles of gold and other little gentlenesses, very well worked, which they arrange on their hair and beards, so that I viewed some that had their beard ornamented with gold, which was beautiful to see.38 Colombin's reponse to Peiresc's questions about funerary rites was ex- tremely detailed, as he had actually been able to attend the funeral of a respected matriarch. Warriors' obsequies were different, however, and Co- lombin confirmed what Peiresc had heard. The deceased was buried along with his wife and those servants whose presence he deemed necessary in the next world. "And if he was valiant in life, and had cut many heads off his enemies, one carried them all to the tomb to mark his valor, because they make such a state over the heads of their enemies that they have cut off, that they guard them like a treasure, in their houses, and in some places they drink from the skull."-39 But even with this precious information about lands which few Euro- peans had ever visited, and about which nothing had yet been published, Peiresc was not entirely satisfied. In a second letter of 1 August Peiresc thanked Colombin for his letter. "I have taken great pleasure, among other things, in seeing the relation that you've made of those great trees adored as idols, and those living gods the Kings of Benin, as well as the sun, the moon and other animals, as in the description that you've made of that species of monkeys.40 After repeating many of the same queries, Peiresc added, specifically, that he wished to know more about the "symbols or devises [with] which they ornament or enrich their shields, as well as the crests of their headgear, 39 "Aultres accommodent leurs cheveux de diverses figures, les uns, faisant des couron- nes, demi-cercles, touffes; autres ont les cheveux fort longs qu'ils tressent et entortillent autour de leur tate et en font comme un turban; les autres enrichissent et parent leur t&amp;te de mille petites bagatelles.

But foremost on his mind was that custom of drinking from the skulls of conquered enemies. The plea for further in- formation was reiterated. What you added about the practice of those who are so keen to drink from the skulls of their enemies killed in war is greatly wor- thy of a more particular disquisition if you go back to those places, or if there are there any of your friends for whom it is worth the effort. That's to say that it would be necessary not only to know the precise place of all the different places where this custom is still in use, but also what words in their language are used to name the kinds of cups and drinks, and the interpretation and etymology of these same words, if one could penetrate that far. And if they didn't sometimes put one inside the other in order to drink with greater dignity and precedence or magnificence.41 III. Why was Peiresc so interested in knowing whether warriors drank from the skulls of the vanquished? To answer this we have to explain something of Peiresc's great fascination with ancient metrology. According to Gassendi, a comprehensive study of weights and measures was one of the four great projects that Peiresc planned and toward which he worked his entire life, but never completed. He seems to have viewed weights and measures as artifacts that compressed a great deal of information about society into a finite form. But what kind of information? The key is Peiresc's special interest in anthropomorphic vases. A trail of letters concerning vases with human heads as lids, what we know of as Egyptian canopic vases, has survived to illustrate the keenness with which Peiresc pursued their owners for drawings or even copies. Sydney Aufrdre, who has documented this obsession in his extremely valuable study of Peiresc's Egyptology, La Momie et la Tempete, suggests that Peiresc's plan involved comparing the volume of water held by these vases with the aim of establishing a map "according to epochs, places, and civilizations."42 41 Peiresc to Colombin de Nantes, 1 August 1634, Correspondance avec plusieurs Mis- sionaires, 81. 42 Sidney Aufrere, La Momie et la Tempete.

What Selden did using essentially texts only, Peiresc did using texts and things: showing the com- plex, intertwined relations between peoples and their practices, in times long past. Peiresc's interest in anthropomorphic vases focuses on a particular mo- ment in Selden's history of symbol-making, not the origin of the gods but the beginning of society, not the Olympians or their eastern equivalents, but of heroes translated into divinity to honor contributions to mankind. Myth recorded the earliest stage of human history and preserved its mem- ory in religious rites and ritual articles. Peiresc's dossier on weights and measures43 contains a long essay, mostly in Peiresc's hand, though parts of it seem to have been prepared by a secretary as a fair copy, entitled "Examination of the measurement of my ancient vases of bronze and pre- cious stone, and of the modern models made in Rome on the antique ones of the late Cardinal Farnese, Cavalier Gualdo, and others. Which I had made at Boysgnecy [Belgentier] in July and August 1632. On the bowls, and of my ancient throwing spear [pilum]." This long and detailed study reveals both the extent of Peiresc's book-learning and his commitment to the examination of things. Peiresc discusses anthropomorphic vases in gen- eral, but also presents them as a distinctly Egyptian form. "The Egyptians have their Canopus, not only in the form of a bearded man, which Sr Her- wart put one of the oldest as number 50 in his Theatrum Hieroglyphicum," but also women, and some that represented the heads of wolves, eagles, chimpanzees or monkeys.44 The manner of these vases, under the sacred figures of their gods, could come from the design to make them held more religiously inviolable, in order to prevent fraudulence and that when one re- covered them in the Temples of their Gods (where the public weights and measures were held in reserve and on deposit) where one went to examine and correct measurements from the doubts that could be formed, as if it were by the oracles of the Gods, even without speaking.45 43 B.N. F.fr. 9532. 44 B.N.

This sort of vase, he suggested, would have been stored in temples in order to provide an absolute, clear standard of rectitude-unlike the ambiguity inherent in the recourse to oracles, for example.46 Material and size were both meaningful. Peiresc "conceived," accord- ing to Gassendi, that the "greatest reckoning was to be made of the more precious ones [made of silver or other costly materials] because the Ancients were wont in them to affect certain kinds of measures, also that by that means they might be more acceptable, either as being ordained for sacri- fices, or that being kept in Temples, (for most of them were consecrated gifts) they might there the longer remain as Standards, or authentick models of Measures."47 As for size, if gods or goddesses were represented on a cyathe, the figure represented on a demi-cyathe, like an Antinous in his collection, would be "Hero or demi-god." This corresponds precisely to Selden's category of daemones-men who became gods.48 The Canopus represents a precise stage in the evolution of human civilization, an interme- diate one, between the savage, or mimetic, mind and the symbolic form. This brings us back to that insistent question about drinking from skulls. On 2 May 1632, the Monsignor de Saint Benoist wrote to Peiresc. "I send you the two vases that were found the 12th February past, in a vineyard of the monastery close to the Seigneurial house at Vallauris (which they were newly planting, amongst the stones and in the clay-like soul." The diggers thought they had come across some buried copper or treasure; in the course of excavation pieces might have been broken and taken by them. The father apologized for this on behalf of the other fathers, espe- addjuster les mesures des doubtes qui s'y pouvoient former, comme si c'estoient des ora- cles determinez par les Dieux mesmes sans parler" (B.N. F.fr. 9532 fol. 229v). Discussion of the Egyptian "canopus" begins in the last paragraph of the previous page: "Les Aegyp- tiens avoient leur CANOPUS non seulement au visage d 'homme avec la barbe ... mais encores un autre . . . qui n'a point de barbe, et done le voile au couvre-chef a une bore- deure plus convenable aux femmes qu'aux hommes comme j'en ay la teste d'un d'Alabas- tre onctual sans barbe qui a servy de couvercle de vase anciennement. Or il y a des medailles d'Hadrian a deux canopes qui semblent estre des visages d'homme et de femme, avec une aigle volante, et par dessus les testes de Sarapis et d'Isis" (fol. 229r). 46 "Comme les anciens ne vouloit rien laisser d'inutile, possible vouloient ils aussy que ce fust de la, comme chose plus sacree, que des simples mesures, qu'il vouloient qu'on allast chercher les proportions des justes poids et mesures, pour y adiuster celles des persones particulieres" (B.N.

He identified them as the kind of cups called Sunduo and Symbibae, which were meant to be placed one inside the other "and because near the brim of the inner Cup, there was a golden Crown, he thought it was thence apparent, what it was among the Ancients, Vina Co- ronare, to Crown the Wine."5o The letters on the cup, moreover, not only praised the gods, they also indicated its measure by their number. Peiresc had these ancient evidences of Greek and Roman practice be- fore him-and on his travels, probably, he had seen nested German drink- ing glasses, up to twelve fitted one inside the other.-" We know that the discovery at Vallauris fired his curiosity to learn everything he could about nesting cups, as we see in a long letter to the President de Mesmes (M. de Roissy) of 6 February 1633. In it, he suggests an originally sacrificial pur- pose, in which the measurements of volume referred to specific offerings. The Greek letters, however, not only marked the liquid measure but also referred to the specific Gods "whom they celebrated in feasts, principally by drinking [inter pocula]."52 It was in the very next year that Peiresc for- mulated his questions to his three correspondents in Africa about drinking out of skulls. Gassendi's explanation of the drinking cups found at Vallauris explains what Peiresc was looking for: Also he shewed the Reason why they drank in a double cup, from the times of ancient Barbarisme; For in those dayes, they drank in their enemies Skulls, whom they had slain; and the more a man had slain, the more Skulls he drank in, one glewed to another. But when men came to be civilized, they at length abhorred that cus- tome, yet they substituted in the room thereof, certaine Vessels resembling Skulls (as these had such a kind of shape) but not so horrible in respect of the matter.53 49 "Je vous envoie les deux vases qui furent trouvez le douziesme febvrier passe dans une vigne du monastere proche de leur maison seigneuriale a Valaurie (qu'ilz sont planter de nouveau) entre des pierres et parmy de terre argileuse et tenace" (Carp.

Greek-influenced Roman nesting cups found in Gaul might well follow more ancient Gallic practices. Nesting skulls used as cups in Africa by the Galli, or their neighbors, could either suggest a historical derivation of the Mediterranean custom, or a parallel development reflecting a fundamental and common aspect of human nature and stage of social life. While many in the seventeenth century used "pagan" to mean non- Christian, for Peiresc, at least in his African correspondence, it meant also "primitive." The Romans were pagans but the evidence of the vases showed that they represented a very late stage of a religious and social develop- ment-later still than the semi-mythical mind that had produced the Cano- pus-one that had begun long before in the worship of trees, deification of warrior-heroes and ritual cannibalism, and which could still be seen in contemporary Africa. If Peiresc had stopped here we would marvel at his extraordinary his- torical vision, but he went even further. In one of his last letters to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, from February 1637, he turned to discuss the reli- quary of the head of John the Baptist that he had seen in the Cathedral of Amiens.54 It was covered in silver with Greek inscriptions dating from 54 Peiresc to Barberini, 6 February 1637, Vatican, B.A.V., MS. Barb.-Lat. 6503, ff.195v- 196r: "Quanto alla preciosisso reliquie del Capo di S. Gio.

The skull and forehead had been removed "just like when the ancient Gauls and Scythians adapted the cranium of the heads of their enemies in the form of a cup or patena to drink in it under the name of SCALA or [ ... ] mounted in gold or silver, as was practiced, according to Paul the Deacon, by that Longbard King Alboino on the skull of the head of that King Cuni- mando, father of the Queen, his wife." The most ancient representations of Saint Dionysius of Paris also showed him carrying in his hand only the crown of his skull, and still in possession of his face, from the lower part of the forehead downward. "Which made me doubt, another time, if the prac- tice was not commanded to cut the head rather than the neck, and that the miracle was not more realistic, that Saint Dionysius would have carried his head in his hand while walking, with his eyes remaining in their natural position in his head." Saint Miltrio, he added, was also portrayed in the same manner. Peiresc suggested that the manner of Miltrio's and Dionysius's martyr- dom actually reflected a widespread form of execution in ancient Gaul, "by making of them beakers and cups and so better to sate the anger of those that made them die, with greater fury than was ever done to enemies taken in war." These judicial executions, in turn, were a form of collective mem- ory. ". . . [S]ince it was the custom of the Gallic peoples to make cups from the skulls of the heads of enemies, nor of the Gauls alone, but of the Scythi- ans, as Herodotus said, who received it with great vanity to drink in their public feasts." Peiresc added, in the margin of the letter, the conclusion he had drawn from his researches. "And for greater glory they doubled the one inside the other as a sign of the multiplicity of enemies killed in war, whence came the custom of those double cups [paterne] called symbibae." With this he turned from late antique Gaul to modern Africa, sharing with Cardinal Francesco the course of his inquiries. "And this is still practiced tanto stranno di presupponere che nell'istesso modo si fosse d San Gio Batta fatto tagliare la testa piu tosto che il collo, per adoperare il cranio a guisa di becchiere, et che si fosse portata dello crania inmezzo al banquetto dove si stava a bevere, per goderne la forma et proportione antecipamente et forzi beverci ancora benche era sanguinolento, poi che non hanno horrore i popoli barbari di bevere il sangue istesso tutto caldo, anzi dicono trovarlo di grandiss" sapore. Pratticandosi ancora son hoggi fra i popoli de confini de Canada, dove non solo i nemici presi in guerra sono martyrizzati, e cavato loro il sangue per esser bevuto in presenza loro, ma quando se n'e cavata qualche quantita vi si applica il fuoco per fermarlo, et se ne da da bevere all istesso martyre prima che remora, per farlo partici- pare alla dolcezza di quel gusto, anzi gli si tagliano carni et si fanno arrostire, et se gliene da da mangiare a luy medesimo, et la mangiano allegramente come s'andasse a nozze." 694</page><page sequence="21">Miller + Peiresc's Africa by the barbarous peoples of Mediterranean Africa,-' who are called Galli, and would be the descendents of the ancient Gauls, of whom they retain an infinity of other rites like this one of drinking from the heads of enemies." This is the early modern antiquary as historical anthropologist, integ- rating fragments from travelers, the Bible, and material culture to reach back to the practices of primitive man-once the earliest Europeans and now living Africans-for which no other sources survived. Peiresc thought that even John the Baptist's decapitation could-Peiresc thought it not too far a stretch-reflect this same primitive urge. "In this way it would not be so strange to presuppose that in the same way Saint John the Baptist had his head cut rather than the neck, to adapt the skull to the form of a cup and the skull could have been brought into the midst of the banquet where they were drinking, in order to appreciate the form and proportion-and perhaps also to drink while it is still bloody, since the barbarous peoples have no horror of drinking the blood while it is still hot as they are said to find it very tasty." If, thus far, the line of Peiresc's inquiry hesitates between a genetic and structural view of human history, his next leap, from first-century Judea to seventeenth-century North America seems to tilt towards the latter. "And still today they practice it among the peoples on the frontier of Canada, where not only enemies taken in war are martyred, and their blood drained from them to be drunken in their presence, but when a certain amount is drained, fire is applied to close it [the wound], and they give it to drink to the martyr himself without delay so to make him partake of the pleasure of that taste, then they cut flesh and roast it, and they give it to eat to him to eat, and they eat happily as if going to a wedding." It was in contemporary Africa that Peiresc believed he could catch a glimpse of the moment when religion and society both began. It was a his- tory preserved in things, not words-at least not in written ones. Peiresc was not the first serious historical thinker to ponder these sorts of parallels. After him these references come faster and more furious, but after Karl Lamprecht, who contended that it was "completely absurd" to argue that the shared use of a single ornamental pattern in ancient Greece and even -" This is an intriguing phrase, as Peiresc knew full well that these "Galli" were not found along the coast of Mediterranean Africa any longer, but were much further south-as is evident in the direction of his queries to d'Arcos, Father Colombin, and Zacharie Vermeil in Ethiopia.
