Stud. 24, pp. 189-212 BRIAN LEFTOW THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY The claim that God is eternal is a standard feature of late-classical and mediaeval philosophical theology. It is prominent in discussions of the rela? tion of God's foreknowledge to human freedom, and its consequences pervade traditional accounts of other kinds of divine knowledge, of God's will, and of God's relation to the world. So an examination of the concept of eternity promises to repay our efforts with a better understanding of the history of philosophical theology and with insight into the concept of God. Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann's 'Eternity' is a forceful, sophis? ticated presentation and defence of the notion of eternity.1 Our treatment of eternity will focus on two of Stump and Kretzmann's claims. First, Stump and Kretzmann contend that eternity is a kind of 'atemporal duration'. We will see that while this is true, it is only part of the story. Second, Stump and Kretzmann claim to provide a viable account of how the existence of an eternal being can be simultaneous with some temporal event. We will see that and why they have not done so. I. TWO MODELS OF ETERNITY Stump and Kretzmann focus their discussion on the following text from Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. Eternity is the complete possession all at once of illimitable life (interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio). This becomes clearer by comparison with temporal things. For whatever lives in time proceeds as something present from the past into the future, and there is nothing placed in time that can embrace the whole extent of its life equally. Indeed, on the contrary, it does not yet grasp tomorrow but yesterday it has already lost, and even in the life of today you live no more fully than in a mobile, transitory moment... (A temporal thing's) life may be infinitely long, but it does not embrace its whole extent simultaneously... Therefore, whatever includes and possesses the whole fullness of illimitable life at once and is such that nothing future is absent from it and nothing past has flowed away, this is rightly judged to be eternal, and of this it is necessary both that being in full possession of itself it be always present to itself and that it have the infinity of mobile time present to it.2 This text contrasts two sorts of'illimitable life'. One is endless temporally 1 Norman Kretzmann and Eleonore Stump, 'Eternity', Journal of Philosophy, (1981), 429-58. 2 Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy V, prose 6, quoted at Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. 430.1 have added one line of the original text to what Stump and Kretzmann quote.</page><page sequence="2">I90 BRIAN LEFTOW extended life, which lasts forever but cannot be lived all at once. The other, eternity, seems to be limitless life which is lived all at once. Now according to Boethius, if anything is a life and is temporally extended, it is not lived all at once. Boethius states that an eternal life is lived all at once. It follows that on Boethius' view, an eternal life is not temporally extended. Any life with earlier and later parts is temporally extended. So though it is limitless and thus in some sense lasts forever, eternal life does not divide into earlier and later parts. Nor is an eternal life located in time, for if time is to be real, a limitless life lived all at once cannot exist in time. Suppose that a temporal being lives at once that of its life which is at t+ 1 and that of its life which occurs at an earlier time /. Something temporal can at once live life-at-/ and life at-?+ 1 only if its living is temporally simultaneous with both / and t+ 1. If its living is so, then / and t+ 1 are simultaneous, counter to our original assumption. If an eternal being exists in time, it exists forever, as otherwise its duration will not be 'limitless'. Therefore if an eternal being exists in time, all moments of time are simultaneous - which is to say that time, taken as a tissue of relations of precedence and succession, does not exist. Hence if time exists, then if there is an eternal being, that being must lack temporal location. Boethius clearly believes that God coexists with temporal creatures. Thus he is committed to denying his God location in time. Based on the text above, Stump and Kretzmann find in the Boethian con? cept of eternity the notes of life, illimitability, duration and atemporality.1 Eternity is for them an atemporal duration, a limitless timelike extension without the earlier and later 'parts' whose succession characterizes time. Paul Fitzgerald has recently argued that the claim that something is extended yet in no way has parts is self-contradictory, and that we therefore must conceive eternity not as an extension, as Stump and Kretzmann sug? gest, but as like a point.2 For Fitzgerald, then, Boethius' talk of eternity as the possession of life ' all at once ' means that an eternal life occurs in a pointlike manner, without being in any way 'spread out' or extended over a duration, as lives in time are. That eternity is 'complete possession' of life presumably reinforces this idea : temporal beings lose that of their life which is past, but as eternal life is in no way extended, it is in no way out of the possession of or apart from its subject. One can also take eternity's being possession of ' illimitable ' (in the Latin, 'interminabilis') life in accord with the point model. For what is not extended cannot be limited in its extent,3 nor can one limit (set bounds to or 'terminate') its extent internally by dividing its extension into parts. 1 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. 431-4. 2 Paul Fitzgerald, 'Stump and Kretzmann on Time and Eternity', Journal of Philosophy, lxxxii (1985), 260-9 3 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. 432.</page><page sequence="3">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 191 Both extensional and ' point ' readings of Boethius' definition of eternity are prima facie plausible. Boethius' definition was a staple of mediaeval discussions of eternity; thus it is perhaps not surprising that both extensional and 'point' models of eternity figure in these discussions, often cheek by jowl. For instance, in the Proslogion, Anselm writes that neither You nor the eternity which you are has any parts... but You (always) exist as a whole,1 a fairly clear use of the point model. But then his next sentence adds ' through your eternity, You were, You are and You will be '... that is, by being eternal, God endures. Anselm then goes on to qualify his duration model : since being past is different from being future, and being present is different (from each), how does Your eternity exist as a whole?... Then in no case were you yesterday or well you be tomorrow ; instead, yesterday, today and tomorrow, you are. Or better, you simply are, existing beyond all time.2 This qualification is motivated by the point model, or more precisely by the doctrine of divine simplicity which (as will emerge) motivates that model. Anselm fears that talking of God as past, present and future ascribes different, distinct temporal parts to Him, as (he thinks) would be incom? patible with His eternity's pointlikeness and His simplicity.3 But soon after making this qualification, Anselm once more applies the duration model: Your eternity encompasses the dimensions of temporality... it has many dimensions with respect to its endless immensity.4 Again, in Summa Theologiae (henceforward ST) la 10, i ad i, Aquinas explicitly likens eternity to a point. Yet at once, in ST la 10, i ad 2, Thomas endorses the claim that eternity involves duration. Stump and Kretzmann consider the extension model the sole correct understanding of eternity. Fitzgerald thinks that only the point model will do. As both sides of the dispute opt for just one model of eternity, both are committed to calling the occurrence of the other model in mediaeval dis? cussions at best a matter of loose, inappropriate usage. I would like to suggest that the use of both models is deliberate and may be necessary. The Boethian definition of eternity Anselm, Aquinas and other mainstream mediaevals adopted may involve a 'two model' situation: just as one must use both particle- and wave-models in thinking about quanta, perhaps one must use both point- and extension-models in thinking about Boethian eternity. If this is so, it is because the definition of eternity defines (inter alia) a kind of life 1 J. Hopkins and H. W.

As a point has no dimensions, but only location, talk of eternity as dimensional models it on an extension.</page><page sequence="4">IO,2 BRIAN LEFTOW that could be enjoyed by a metaphysically simple being. As eternity is a kind of life, it invites and perhaps required us to model it as a way of enduring, or a sort of duration. As eternity is the life of a simple being, it invites and perhaps requires us to model it as lacking parts, and so point-like.1 Boethius clearly holds that eternity is a mode of life of a simple being. We have seen him define eternity as a kind of life. The Consolation of Philosophy also connects eternity and simplicity. The Consolation defines eternity during a treatment of divine foreknowledge which grows out of a discourse about God's providential ordering of world events. During this latter discourse we read that the simple and unchanging plan of events is providence, and fate is... the disposition in and through time of all the events which God has planned in His simplicity... Imagine a set of revolving concentric circles. The inmost one comes closest to the simplicity of the center... Anything that joins itself to the (inner) circle is brought close to simplicity... everything is freer from fate the closer it seeks the center of things. And if is cleaves to the steadfast mind of God, it...escapes the necessity imposed by fate... the relationship between the everchanging course of fate and the stable simplicity of providence is like that between that which is coming into being and that which is, between time and eternity, or between the moving circle and the still point in the middle.2 At least three things in this text bear noting. First, it clearly asserts God's simplicity. Second, it compares a simple deity to the geometric centre of a series of concentric circles - to a point, at 'the center of things'. Third, Boethius explicitly likens time and changing things ('the moving circle') to eternity and a simple, changeless thing: just as time is the mode of being of things in change, so eternity, it seems, is the mode of being of the simple point at the centre of things, God. Aquinas makes the connections between simplicity, eternity, life and our two models of eternity more explicit. Thomas argues that God's simplicity entails His immutability and His immutability entails His eternity.3 To him, then, eternity is a direct consequence of metaphysical simplicity. Again, Aquinas holds that necessarily, God alone is simple and necessarily, God alone is truly eternal.4 This commits him to the claim that necessarily eternality is a mode of life proper only to a simple being. Thomas adds in ST la io, 2 ad 3 that 'eternity and God are the same thing'. If one takes this 1 Plotinus would be an exception to my thesis. In his system, that which is simple, the One, is 'above' even being eternal, and that which is eternal is Nous, which is ' below ' the One. Hence in Plotinus, only the extensional model of eternity would apply. Augustine and later Christian writers in effect merged aspects of Plotinus' One and Nous in their description of God. I will deal only with writers who make this conflation. 2 Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy, tr. V. E. Watts (London: Penguin Books, 1969), bk. iv, prose 6, pp. 136-7. Earlier, Boethius has argued that God is unity itself, and applied to God Parmenides' description of Being as a homogenous sphere (bk. 3, x-xn), which arguably expresses the same intuitions which were to find full flower in the doctrine of divine simplicity. 3 ST la 9, 1; 10, 2. 4 CF. De Ente et Essentia, c. 4 and ST la 10, 3.</page><page sequence="5">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 193 claim as literally as its context warrants, it allows one to infer eternity's simplicity from God's. So it is hardly surprising that in ST la 10, i Thomas compares eternity to time as the simple to the composite, and that in expanding on this in ?7Ta 10, i ad i, he compares eternity with a point; and it is at least plausible that Thomas uses the point model precisely because of eternity's connection with metaphysical simplicity. But Aquinas also uses the extension model, and connects this model of eternity with the life of an eternal being in ST la 10 i ad 2. That which is eternal is not only existent but living. Now living includes in a way activity... and flow of duration is more apparent in activity than in existence. Thus Aquinas sees eternity as a sort of duration because it is a sort of life. For Boethius as for Aquinas, eternity is the mode of life of a simple being. This may explain why both point- and extension-models provide viable interpretations of Boethius' definition of eternity. Given the definition's roots in the doctrine of divine simplicity and the claim that God is alive, Boethius may well have had both point- and extension-models in view as he thought about eternity. So perhaps he deliberately gave a definition of eternity which could be explained in both ways, or perhaps both models at least at some level influenced his choice of expressions. 2. DIVINE SIMPLICITY Most mainstream mediaevals would agree with Boethius and Aquinas on the connection of simplicity and eternity. For most mediaevals held that God is metaphysically simple, and despite differences in philosophical vocabulary, the vast majority of them meant the same thing by this claim. Writers with differing philosophical resources available had different ideas about what sorts of metaphysical distinctions or complexity the world contained. But to say that God is metaphysically simple is to say that whatever such sorts of distinction or complexity there are, none are to be found in God. So differ? ences in writers' stocks of distinctions and modes of complexity do not entail differences in their doctrines of divine simplicity. But if mainstream mediaevals had the doctrine of divine simplicity Aquinas and Boethius shared, any logical connections between simplicity and eternity unearthed in Aquinas and Boethius will be there in the positions of others, though these others' explicit awareness of these connections may in fact vary. We have seen that simplicity and eternity are connected. If we explore the doctrine of divine simplicity, we can see just how they are connected. As was just noted, the claim that God is metaphysically simple asserts that God exemplifies no metaphysical distinctions of any sort. This means, for instance, that whether or not it is true that God is good, if God is simple, it is false that God is the subject of a distinct attribute, goodness. Rather, if God</page><page sequence="6">194 BRIAN LEFTOW is simple, ' God is good ' is true because of precisely the same state of affairs making 'God is God' true, and this 'state of affairs' contains no components or complexity of any sort. To put it another way, if God is simple, that in God which makes it correct to call him good is in no way distinct from that which makes it correct to call Him God. We give the name ' goodness ' to that in a thing which makes it correct to call it good. So we can rephrase our example this way: if God is simple, then God is identical with goodness, or with His goodness. (We will see below that the difference does not matter.) More generally, if God is simple, then for all F, if God is really F, God is identical with Fness. The qualification 'really' alludes to the common distinction between real and 'mere Cambridge' attributes. Examples of real attributes include being red, round and smart. Examples of ' mere Cambridge ' attributes include being envied by the mob and being thought about by Ronald Reagan. One could say that while real attributes really are attributes of their subjects, 'mere Cambridge' attributes are merely shadows cast on their subjects by real attributes of other subjects : it is because Ronald Reagan has the real attribute of thinking of me that I have the ' merely Cambridge ' attribute of being thought about by Ronald Reagan. No generally recognized criterion for sorting attributes as 'real' or 'mere Cambridge' exists. But the two sorts of attribute clearly differ, and it is clear in most cases which attributes are of which sort. Now having real attributes involves some sort of real complexity. A human being is in reality a much more complex sort of entity than a round red after-image, and one can represent this complexity by saying that human beings have many more real attributes than after-images. It seems intuitively, though, that I do not become any the more complex really if first one person, then another, and then a whole crowd begin to think about me. That only real attributes entail real complexity is the reason the doctrine of divine simplicity identifies God with only His real attributes : having distinct mere Cambridge attributes would not import any real complexity into the divine being. Now if God is simple, all statements about God are true or false in virtue of the same state of affairs, and this state of affairs, as said above, involves no metaphysical complexity. It may however involve what one could call theological complexity. Boethius, Anselm, Aquinas and most other major Latin mediaevals were orthodox Christians, and therefore were Trinitarians who held that the distinction between the three divine Persons is somehow an aspect of God's intrinsic reality. Thus all three would grant that the sole exception to God's real simplicity is whatever complexity may be involved in the truth-conditions of Trinitarian statements, if they could find no way to maintain both the doctrine of the Trinity and the claim that God is simple in absolutely all respects. Were Trinity and absolute simplicity to prove incompatible, these writers could say that they still maintain God's meta</page><page sequence="7">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 195 physical simplicity. That is, they could say that God is simple relative to the distinctions metaphysics is equipped to make, and that theology affirms that God is complex relative to some further distinctions theology alone is equipped to draw.1 But let us leave Trinitarian considerations aside. The doctrine of divine simplicity just presented seems to have a bizarre consequence. If God is identical with an attribute or attributes, does it not follow that He is an attribute, or some other sort of abstract entity? Aquinas explicitly affirms that a simple God appears abstract at ST la 13, i ad 2. To speak of the form itself, we use abstract nouns which... signify... that by which something is : 'whiteness ', for example, signifies the form as that by which something is white. Now God is...simple, like the form...so we sometimes refer to Him by abstract nouns to indicate His simplicity... That is, a simple God is attributelike in some respects, and so can be spoken of in some terms which are appropriate to attributes. In a recent examination of the doctrine of divine simplicity, Alvin Plantinga found divine attributelikeness unpalatable, and so rejected the doctrine.2 William E. Mann, responding to Plantinga, accedes to his distaste, and so offers on Aquinas' behalf the doctrine that God is identical not with attributes but with His own instances of His attributes : not with (say) goodness, but with His goodness.3 Mann then argues that some attribute instances are concreta : for example, we ourselves are instances of certain attributes. If this is so, Mann contends, one can maintain that a simple deity is identical with attribute-instances and yet concrete. But Mann's proposal either reduces to a version of the claim that God is identical with attributes simpliciter or is not really a doctrine of divine simplicity at all. For either there is or there is not some entity involved in an attribute-instance which is distinct from the attribute being instanced. If there is nothing in an attribute instance which is distinct from the attribute instanced, what Mann proposes is only a shift in terminology, and in fact on his doctrine as on Aquinas ', God is identical with attributes. If there is something in an attribute-instance which is distinct from the attribute involved, then an attribute-instance is a metaphysically complex thing, and so is a God who is identical with an attribute-instance. Apparently, then, a simple God must be attribute-like and seemingly abstract. 1 Aquinas was careful to leave this route open; see Brian Leftow, 'Simplicity and Eternity' (Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1984), ch. 1. That the text mentions this strategy does not imply that I endorse it or that it is ultimately viable. 2 Alvin Plantinga, Does God Have a Nature? (Milwaukee, Wise: Marquette University Press, 1980), pp. 27-47. 3 William E. Mann, 'Divine Simplicity', Religious Studies, xvm (1981), 451-71. Mann's proposal is foreshadowed in Peter Geach's essay on Aquinas in Three Philosophers (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1961).</page><page sequence="8">ig6 BRIAN LEFTOW 3. ABSTRACTNESS EXACERBATED That God, if simple, seems abstract in some respects does not entail that a simple God must be an abstract entity. One could just easily conclude from the identity of God and His attributes that all talk of divine attributes is just an abstract way to speak about the simple yet non-abstract being which is God, or that in the case of a simple being we are in a quantum-mechanical ' two model ' situation, in which some x is incompletely yet truly known when described either as God or as goodness. Aquinas seems to have understood the situation in this latter way.1 But to the extent that the doctrine of divine simplicity makes God appear abstract, it makes Him appear impersonal and lifeless. This appearance is strengthened when one notes that simplicity entails immutability. The connection between simplicity and immutability is plain. For when something changes or undergoes a process, it perdures through alteration: it still exists, and so is in some respects just as it was before, and yet it is in some respects different. Therefore there must be a real distinction between that in the changing thing which passes away and that in it which abides. But in the case of a simple being there can be no such distinction, and so a simple being cannot change or be in process. Now life as we know it involves processes (growth, aging) and changes (e.g. having one's growth rate slow). No living things we possess are attributes and other abstracta. So the immutability which comes along with simplicity increases God's appearance of abstractness. 4. SIMPLICITY, TIMELESSNESS AND TEMPORAL PARTS If a simple God must be timeless, i.e. without temporal extension or location, this adds still more force to the claim that a simple God must be abstract. Aquinas held that immutability entails timelessness.2 If it did, simplicity's entailing timelessness would fall at once out of the last paragraph's argument. But Aquinas' backing for his claim is questionable. Stump and Kretzmann, in a recent article, argue that it is impossible that (a simple) God have any spatial or temporal parts that could be distinguished from one another as here rather than there or as now rather than then, and so God cannot be a physical entity.3 This argument may assume that necessarily, whatever is physical is spatially extended or a temporal continuant, and that 1 Cf. 6TIa 13, lad 2. 2 ST la 10, 1. 3 Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann, 'Absolute Simplicity', Faith and Philosophy 11 (1985), 354</page><page sequence="9">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY I97 T. if God is a temporal continuant (i.e. extends through time), God has temporal parts.1 Given (T), since simplicity rules out having temporal parts, divine simplicity entails divine timelessness. But (T) is debatable. There are at least two alternate ways to view any divine temporal extension. Either falsifies (T). First, one can maintain that any continuant (including God) has temporal extension but not temporal parts.2 This view may sound paradoxical, but given that continuants have temporal extension, it follows from a very plausible claim. It is very plausible that what is reading this paper now is a person, not a temporal part or slice of a person. More generally, it is very plausible that what exists at any point or during any interval along a person's temporal extension is a person, not a temporal part or slice of that person. But then what occupies any sub-region of a temporal extension = what occupies the extension as a whole, and so persons have no proper temporal parts. (Thus, viewed timelessly, persons and other continuants are wholly present ' at once ' in many temporal loci, which is perhaps the viable core of the old idealist claim that continuants are 'concrete universals'.) On this view, God could have temporal extension without having temporal parts and so without violating His simplicity. Secondly, if God is temporal, God's lifetime or history extends through time and has temporal parts. But if a person =(= a history, it is possible to maintain that not God but only His history has temporal extension.3 That a person =(= a history seems clear. For one thing, the identity-conditions for persons and histories differ. If one event in a given history is changed, we have a numerically different history, as (in the strict sense) making one change in the plot of a story gives us a new, distinct story. To suppose that Napoleon won at Waterloo, for example, is strictly speaking to suppose a complete alternative history for our world, not ' the same history, with one change ' : histories are relevantly like ordered rc-tuples of the events which make them up. However, changing one event in which a person is involved does not entail that we have a different person. If it is possible that a person persist when a history does not survive, the person and the history must be distinct. Again, ordinary intuitions favour the claim that a person =)= a 1 To move from these premisses plus the impossibility that God have temporal parts to the claim that God cannot be physical requires also the claim that whatever is physical and temporal is a continuant, for if instantaneous (temporally partless) physical entities were possible, God's inability to have temporal parts would not rule out His being one of these. Stump and Kretzmann's argument could also read as premising that necessarily, whatever is physical is both spatially and temporally extended. In this case it would not require (T), but could instead just claim that necessarily, whatever is physical is spatially extended, that every spatially extended thing has spatial parts and that God cannot have spatial parts. 2 Cf. D. H. Mellor, Real Time (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981), chs. 7, 8. 3 As in D. C Holt, 'Timelessness and the Metaphysics of Temporal Existence', American Philosophical Quarterly, xvm ( 1981 ), 149-56. 8 RES 24</page><page sequence="10">198 BRIAN LEFTOW history. For these favour saying that what exists at any moment is (say) a person or a table, not a temporal part of a person or a table. But if a person = a history, only parts or slices of persons exist at any instant. So again, one could reject (T) by maintaining that though God has a history and so is temporal, since God #= His history, God has no temporal extension or temporal parts. Anselm may have thought that God's simplicity closes off this second way to escape (T). For he argues in Monologion 16 that because God is simple, for every attribute F, then God = imess, and infers from this that (as God is eternal) God = eternity.1 He then argues that if this nature (God) were to exist as a whole... successively at different times... its lifetime, which is... its eternity... would be extended by parts throughout the parts of time. Now its eternity is nothing other than itself. Hence the supreme being would be divided into parts according to the divisions of time... if the supreme being were to...have temporal parts, how would (it) remain firm that the supreme nature is... simple... ?2 Anselm seems to think, in short, that even if in general a person =# a lifetime or history, in God's unique case this is false, and so God must lack temporal extension. But if Anselm does think this, he may just be equivocating on two closely related uses of the term ' eternity ' - at least, he equivocates if he draws his claim that ' its eternity is nothing other than itself from Monologion i6.3 'Eternity' can function as a name from a duration ('how long does God's existence last? For eternity'). It can also act as a name for the attribute of having such a duration, eternality. Anselm's argument in Monologion 16, strictly speaking, is that God = eternality. But what 'would be extended by parts' in the quoted passage is God's lifetime or duration. A simple being must be identical with its attributes and with any other intrinsic meta? physical ' components ' or ' aspects ' (e.g. its ' essence ' or its ' existence '). But if a history, lifetime or duration is not an attribute or some other sort of intrinsic 'component', this does not entail that a simple being must be identical with its history, and so must be complex or extended if its history is. That a simple being is its eternality does not entail that it is its history. And that a simple being's history is extended and complex does not entail that its attribute of having that history is. So (T) is not obviously available to show that simplicity entails timelessness. Can this be shown in another way? 5. SIMPLICITY AND TEMPORAL LOCATIONS Another argument that a simple being must be timeless might run as follows. All attributes of a simple being are really identical. Now if a simple being 1 Cf. Hopkins and Richardson, op. cit. n. 6, pp. 25, 26. 2 Ibid. c. 21, p. 34. 3 I am not aware of any other candidate source for it.</page><page sequence="11">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 199 exists at 1200 and at 1201, it has the attribute of existing at 1200 and the attribute of existing at 1201. These are distinct attributes, since in fact some things which have the first lack the second (e.g. those which cease to exist at 1200 plus thirty seconds). Hence it seems that nothing with both these attributes could be simple. This argument rests on such attributes as existing at 1200. Some would argue that existence is not an attribute. If it is not, is existence-at-noon? In any event, existing at any particular time is not an attribute acquiring or losing which entails going through some real change. This suggests that existing at a particular time would not be a real or intrinsic attribute of a simple being, but would be a 'merely Cambridge' attribute. But again, a simple being is identical only with its real or intrinsic attributes, for only having a distinct real, intrinsic attribute would entail involving real, intrinsic complexity. 6. SIMPLICITY AND HISTORIES One also might argue from simplicity to timelessness by way of the fact that whatever extends through time has a history. My history in some sense helps to constitute me as myself. For it is at least a necessary condition of being me at a certain time that my history at that time is a continuation of a certain history with a certain unique beginning. Now plausibly a history-segment S is a continuation of a history including a prior segment S* only if the subject of S emerges from the subject of S* by some sort of real development: my writing this paper is a continuation of my history, starting at my birth, only if I am the person who grew out my prior stages. If in such cases S continues S*'s history only if the subject of S is in some sort of process, then, it may be that a simple being cannot have a history. If so, a simple being cannot endure through time. But surely what matters for S' continuing S* is only that the subject of S = the subject of S*. This can be secured without a simple being's having to go through any process or real change; since it can, the argument just given fails. We can show, in fact, that any two segments of the histories of simple beings must be segments of the same history. This is so because there can be at most one simple being. For suppose that there are two actual simple beings, A and B. Then A is simple and also has whatever attribute or set of attributes suffice for identity with A. Now the attribute of simplicity either is or is not identical with the attribute or attributes sufficient for identity with A. If it is, and B is simple, then B = A, and we have only one simple being. If it is not, then A is not simple, and as B alone is simple, we again have only one simple being. We can go even further. If it is ' broadly logically' possible that there is a simple being, then 8-2</page><page sequence="12">200 BRIAN LEFTOW S. it is 'broadly logically' possible that the attribute of simplicity = the attribute of identity with that simple being.1 Attribute-identities are ' broadly logically ' necessary. Hence S entails that S*. possibly, necessarily the attribute of simplicity = the attribute of identity with that simple being. Let us make the common assumption that the modal system S5 gives the logic of 'broadly logical' modality. It is a theorem of S5 that possibly necessarily P entails necessarily P. Hence S* entails that S**. necessarily the attribute of simplicity = the attribute of identity with that simple being. So it is not even possible that there be a simple being not identical with our unique simple being - and so, again, any segments of simple beings' histories must be segments of the same history. Another argument from simplicity to timelessness might be the following. Plausibly something more than and distinct from being a person who con? tinues the history which up to now has been mine is involved in being me. This ' more ' must be distinct from being a continuation of the history which up until now has been mine, for something could continue and emerge from this history without being me, or at least without clearly being me (consider your favourite personal-identity puzzle case). This requisite ' more ' must be real and intrinsic, since it determines my very identity. If this is plausible, then perhaps it suggests that anything with a history must be really con? stituted by at least two distinct intrinsic factors, being the continuation of a history and 'something more'. If so, nothing simple can have a history, since nothing simple can contain distinct intrinsic factors. So again, since whatever endures through time has a history, a simple being cannot endure through time. However, if this argument works, it shows only that anything which has a history and can fail to continue its history (being replaced instead by another individual) must be constituted of distinct intrinsic factors. A simple being cannot fail to continue its history. To show this, we need only a definition and two uncontroversial premises. The definition is that D. an individual essence of an individual A = an attribute which A exemplifies in every possible world in which A exists and which nothing other than A exemplifies in any possible world. As we have already seen, (1) if A is simple, A = A's individual essence. Now for an individual essence of A to exist in a possible world W is just for A to be possible in W; for an essence to exist in W is just for it to be 1 For a brief explanation of * broadly logical ' modality, cf.

Now whatever is actual at any time in any world W is broadly logically possible at all times in W\ actuality entails possibility, and given our assump? tion that S5 is its logic, broadly logical possibility varies neither over time nor over possible worlds. So let us suppose that a simple being A exists at some time in W. Then at all times in W, A is possible, and so at all times in W, A's individual essence exists (per (2)). But then per (1), it follows that at all times in W, A exists. If so, a simple being cannot fail to continue its history; hence the argument just completed misses its target. Note, inci? dentally, that via (1) and (2), the doctrine of divine simplicity generates its own version of the ontological argument.1 7. SIMPLICITY AND TWO KINDS OF HISTORY So far, it has proven difficult to connect simplicity and timelessness. None? theless, I do believe that the former entails that latter. Let me briefly indicate why I believe this. Whatever extends through time or is located in time has a history. (Even an instantaneous existent, something with location but no extension in time (if there could be such a thing), would have a history, namely all that happened to and with it in its instant of existence.) It seems plausible that any such history could have been different in some particulars, however minute. It seems plausible too that if some facts or events of a history were different, the subject ofthat history would have been intrinsically different. For instance, if I had had one more cornflake for breakfast today than I did in truth have, I would be very slightly heavier that I in fact am now. Let us call a history composed only of this kind of fact and event a being's intrinsic history. Plausibly, there are facts and events in some histories which are such that if they had been different, the subject of that history would have been in no way intrinsically different. For instance, if there were one more resident of Mongolia today than there in fact is, this surely would not make me intrinsically different in any way. Let us call a history composed only of this kind of fact and event a being's extrinsic history. Let us say that something with an intrinsic history is intrinsically temporal and something with an extrinsic history is extrinsically temporal. All intrinsic attributes of a simple being are identical with its individual essence, per (D), an individual has its individual essence in all possible worlds in which it exists. Thus it is impossible that a simple being be 1 To state the argument properly, one would need carefully to qualify talk of a simple being existing at times and in possible worlds. For some of the rationale for this and some of the qualifications, cf. my ' God and Abstract Entities ', forthcoming in Faith and Philosophy.</page><page sequence="14">202 BRIAN LEFTOW intrinsically different in any way than it in fact is.1 This being so, a simple being can have no intrinsic history and so must be intrinsically timeless ; a simple being can be only extrinsically temporal. I think it highly likely that this is what such men as Aquinas and Anselm meant to say by calling God timeless. The claim that God is simple, then, threatens to render God abstract because it entails that He is timeless. The claim that God is simple, then, threatens to render God abstract because it entails that He is timeless, immutable and identical with attributes. 8. ETERNITY AS AN ANSWER TO ABSTRACTNESS Because it makes God seem abstract, the claim that God is simple forcefully raises the question of how God can be alive. So accepting that God is simple makes it imperative to go on to say just what sort of life a simple being can have, on pain of depriving God of any personal characteristics. Thus I suggest that the doctrine of divine simplicity gave a motive for the devel? opment of the concept of eternity. Given what we have seen, a simple God must live timelessly and changelessly if at all. I suggest that Boethius' description of eternity as interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio serves him, Aquinas and many other mediaevals committed to divine simplicity as {inter alia) a capsule description of simple life. Let us look briefly at how this perspective dictates reading this formula. Total simul: Aquinas states at ST la 10, 4 that even though time lasted for ever, it would be possible to mark off beginnings and ends in it by dividing it into parts... and this cannot happen in eternity... (this is) consequent on the primary and intrinsic difference (which) Boethius points out between time and eternity... that eternity is totum simul while time is not. That eternal life is totum simul explains that fact that it cannot be divided into parts. Thus it is reasonable to say that its being totum simul is just its having no parts, or being simple. An eternal being has its life 'all at once', not part by part. Interminabilis: in the text just quoted, Aquinas connects this term with God's simplicity. For Aquinas, eternal life is 'interminable' not merely because it lacks beginning and end of duration, but also because one cannot terminate parts of its and divide them from other parts of it. Perfecta possessio vitae : is possessing life in the best possible way, in the way appropriate to a perfect being. Aquinas holds that whatever is perfect is purely actual and that if an attribute is distinct from the subject that has it, it realizes a potentiality ofthat subject.2 Any subject with realizable poten? tialities is not purely actual.3 Thus on Aquinas' terms, a perfect being 1 This might seem to entail that all of a simple being's intrinsic attributes belong to it of necessity. I suggest a way to block this conclusion in op. cit. n. 27. 2 ST la 4, 1; Summa Contra Gentiles (henceforth SCG) I, 21 (6). 3 SCG I, 23, 24.</page><page sequence="15">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 20? must be identical with its attributes. Anselm too seems to think that 'perfect possession' of an attribute entails identity with it; he infers God's identity with His attributes from His perfection in Proslogion 18. Anselm reasons that if a perfect being #= its attributes, it owes these attributes to some source distinct from itself, and if this is so, the putatively perfect being depends on that other thing and therefore is less than maximally perfect.1 So at least to Anselm and Aquinas, to possess life perfectly is not just to exemplify the attribute of life but to be identical with that in virtue of which the predicate 'life applies (which is the entity we call the attribute of life). Perhaps we can read this back into Boethius as well. Can anything thus described be called living, or is there just a contra? diction between simplicity and life? One can make a case that simplicity and life are compatible as follows. Whatever thinks or understands must be said to be alive. So if we can conceive of kinds of thinking or understanding which do not extend over time and need not be located in time, we can conceive of kinds of thinking or understanding which we can coherently say that a timeless being could perform. If so, we can conceive of a timeless being's being alive. By the same token, if we can conceive of kinds of thinking or understanding which a simple being could perform, we can conceive of a simple being's being alive. Let us now move toward a description of such a kind of thinking, first trying to conceive of events of understanding which have no duration. Ryle distinguished ' process ' from ' achievement ' uses of words. ' Under? stand ' has both sorts of use. One can speak of the process of understanding a philosophical argument. One can also say that one 'just understands' or 'just sees' what words mean as one reads, without any process of coming to see. This 'just seeing' is an achieving of understanding. Let us expand on this second case. Saying words to oneself is a process. If one recognizes what one says as a word in a context, though, one has understood it - and one can do this without any inner speech. Again, in learning to read, one says phonemes to oneself. One is reading words as distinct from phonemes only when one grasps what the words mean. Understanding of the words' meaning just supervenes on the saying of the phonemes, with no particular relation to the making of these noises. Saying the sounds to oneself in different ways, etc. is not at all necessary to 'seeing' what they mean (as distinct from jogging one's memory for the meaning, etc.). In reading, then, that one has under? stood does not entail that one has gone through a process of understanding, as distinct from a process of making and perceiving sounds in the air, or perceiving marks on a page, or speaking to oneself. One's understanding is not a result of any such process. Nor does it presuppose one : at least, we need not conceive of a process to conceive of it. Nor is the 'just seeing' kind of understanding itself a process. 1 Cf. Monologion 17.</page><page sequence="16">204 BRIAN LEFTOW In some cases, then, understanding is 'just seeing' the meaning of a word. Achieving understanding, in the sense of which we speak, does not take time : to achieve is to have achieved, to understand is to have understood. To put it another way, to achieve understanding of a word or sentence is (normally) to begin to have the disposition of understanding that word or sentence. But beginnings are instantaneous events; they take no time. That an achieving or beginning of understanding is a durationless event does not entail that it, or any other durationless event, can occur indepen? dent of a continuing process or disposition of which it constitutes a boun? dary. But perhaps we can at least conceive of this happening. If so, we can conceive of a durationless event which we need not conceive to be located in time, at least insofar as we do not consider it a boundary of a process or of the duration of some temporally extended entity. The next thing to note is that conceptual complexity in the object of an act or event of understanding does not entail real complexity in the act. That I see two apples on a table does not entail that my act of seeing is in any way really dual or divisible, so too, that I understand a proposition, something conceptually complex, does not entail that the event of my understanding is in any way really complex or divisible. It might seem that at least, an event of understanding must involve some sort of real distinction between the act of understanding and an 'intentional object' somehow 'contained' within it. But many analyses of mental events claim to be able to dispense with this distinction. If we can at least apply one such analysis to the present case, we can conceive of an event as an understanding of (say) a proposition without conceiving it as involving a real distinction between act and object. Now it may also seem that an event of understanding must be really complex insofar as it involves a subject who does the understanding and who is distinct from the act of understanding. However, suppose we consider a mind to be the subject of this event, and say that mental events are distinct from physical events. Suppose also that a mind is not some substantial substrate of mental events, but that ' mind ' is a term we use to refer to temporal sequences of mental events which exemplify certain unifying rela? tions, e.g. the relation which any x and y bear if y possibly contains a memory of an experience which was the content of x. These things need not be true; they need only be conceivable. Now under these assumptions, if an event of understanding were timeless, one could not distinguish between the mind which undergoes this event and the event itself. For we are assuming that a mind (as distinct from a single event) is a temporal sequence of events, and there can be no temporal sequences where there is no time. Suppose now that we conceive of a single event of understanding which is durationless and involves no real distinction within its content, between its content and the act of understanding it or between the act of understanding this content and the non-physical mind which understands it. If we can</page><page sequence="17">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 205 conceive all this, we are at least part of the way to conceiving what a simple, atemporal act of understanding might be like. If so, we are en route to conceiving what the eternal life of a simple being might be like. That we can travel at least part of the way to this may be some reason to think that the concept of eternity is coherent. Note too that if we can conceive all of this^ we can rid ourselves of the point-like tension in Boethius' concept of eternity. For the foregoing paragraphs have not conceived of this act of understanding as in any way extended. Still, these paragraphs are merely a problematic sketch of an argument; they require filling out and defence. Further, if the concept of eternity is ^ concept of the kind of life a simple being could enjoy, one cannot settle the question of whether something can be eternal without addressing the question of whether something can be metaphysically simple. So perhaps any final judgement of whether it is possible that something be eternal will have to depend on an evaluation of the doctrine of divine simplicity. 9. ETERNAL-TEMPORAL SIMULTANEITY Boethius, Anselm and Aquinas claim that God is eternal. They also hold that God causes things to happen in time and knows what happens in time. If a timeless being cannot cause things to happen in time or know what happens in time, then, our authors contradict themselves. Now if a timeless God cannot act or exist before, after or in some sense simultaneously with events in time, one can make little sense of a claim that a timeless God can cause or perceive temporal events. Thus defenders of God's eternity try to secure some sense in which an eternal God exists and acts simultaneously with events in time. We have seen Boethius say, for instance, that in some sense, a timeless God has the whole of time 'present' to Himself. Aquinas too, following Boethius, writes at ?ST la 14, 13 that eternity... comprises all time... all things that are in time are present to God from eternity... because His glance is carried from eternity over all things as they are in their presentiality. By exploring the prospects for defining a simultaneity-relation between the eternal and the temporal, we may take a step toward seeing whether we can apply the concepts of agency and perception to an eternal being. Stump and Kretzmann attempt to clarify the relation between an eternal deity and things in time by employing an analogy with relativity theory.1 Relativity theory asserts that whether two events occur at the same time or at different times is not absolute and invariable. Rather, this depends on the inertial reference-frame within which one locates these events : pairs of events which occur at the same time relative to one inertial frame of reference may occur at different times relative to a second inertial frame of reference. 1 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. n. i, 437-40.</page><page sequence="18">206 BRIAN LEFTOW (Assuming that one picks out a first reference-frame relative to oneself, one can define an inertial frame of reference as any system of physical objects which moves at uniform velocity relative to another inertial frame of refer? ence.) Citing a standard example, Stump and Kretzmann invite us to consider a train which travels at f the speed of light and is struck at both ends by lightning. Suppose that an observer standing on the ground as the train passes sees the lightning bolts strike the front and rear of the train simul? taneously. The train-observer is moving toward the front lightning bolt and away from the rear lightning bolt at f light-speed. Thus the light from the front bolt will reach him some period of time before the light of the rear bolt does. And so, if he can see both bolts, he will see the front bolt some period of time before he sees the rear bolt. Thus for the train-observer, the two lightning-strikes will not occur simultaneously; he will see first the front lightning-strike and then the rear event. According to relativity theory, this is not just a matter of the way the observers see things. The two events really are simultaneous in the reference-frame of the ground observer and non simultaneous in the reference-frame of the train observer. The relativity of simultaneity to reference-frames entails that there is no unique right answer to the question ' were the two strikings simultaneous ? ' Rather, the answer to this question depends on the reference-frame with respect to which it is asked. Still, one can, if one likes, define a sort of simultaneity that will obtain not just within but between reference-frames. Suppose that two events occur at the same time in a frame A. If the same two events occur at once in frame B, one could say that two events occur at the same time not merely within frame A and within frame B but ' between ' frames A and B ; by extending this, one could perhaps define a relativistic proxy for Newtonian absolute simultaneity, namely simultaneity within and so between all reference frames. Stump and Kretzmann define eternal-temporal (ET) simultaneity rather as we just defined simultaneity 'between' frames A and B. They first take eternity to be something like one more reference-frame in addition to any temporal reference frames. They then define the simultaneity-relation as follows : For every x and for every j, x andj are ET-simultaneous iff (i) either x is eternal and y is temporal, or vice versa; and (ii) for some observer, A, in the unique eternal reference frame, x and y are both present - i.e. either x is eternally present andjy is observed as temporally present, or vice versa; and (iii) for some observer, B, in one of the infinitely many temporal reference frames, x and y are both present, i.e. either x is observed as eternally present and y is temporally present, or vice-versa.1 1 Ibid. 439.</page><page sequence="19">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 207 (ii) speaks of a unique eternal reference-frame. The rationale for this, I suspect, is as follows. Distinct temporal reference-frames exist iff the same temporal events bear incompatible temporal relations to one another : that is, iff some temporal events A and B, as wholes, are both simultaneous and non simultaneous. Part of what distinguishes eternity from time, to Boethius, is that eternity lacks earlier and later 'parts'. If this is so, eternal entities or events cannot be earlier or later than one another; all eternal entities or events must exist or occur simultaneously. So eternal entities or events cannot bear incompatible eternal relations to one another, and therefore the basis for distinguishing multiple eternal reference-frames necessarily is lacking. 10. SOME PROBLEMS IN THE DEFINITION (ii) and (iii), as stated, entail that two things or events are not ET simultaneous unless two observers exist and make certain observations. This entailment can seem to create difficulties. One wants to say that whatever ET-simultaneity might be, an eternal being could bear this relation even to temporal reference-frames entirely without observers: God, for instance, would still be ET-simultaneous with any Earthly reference-frame even after some calamity emptied it of observers. One also wants to say that an eternal reference-frame might be ET-simultaneous with a temporal reference-frame even if both were devoid of observers, provided that if these frames did contain observers, these observers could note the appropriate relations. Beyond this, one might wonder whether any possible observer could observe what (iii) requires: is 'eternal presence' an observable quality? (ii) requires that a being not located in time know what is happening now. Whether this is possible is still a subject of controversy.1 But a more basic difficulty with (ii) is that it requires an eternal being to observe something. The fact that whatever is eternal is simple renders this theologically in? appropriate. Let me explain. Suppose that a simple deity observes the universe. Now it is plausible that for all x and y, x observes y only if y causally contributes to x having a certain experience, and so only if y causally contributes to the existence ofx' observational knowledge. A simple God = His knowledge.2 Hence if a simple deity observes the universe, the universe causally contributes to God's existence: that is, the universe is a logically and causally necessary condition of God's existence. Theists will not accept this, and so cannot grant that a simple God has literal observational knowledge. 1 Recent contributions to the debate include Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. n. i, 453-8; Richard Gale, 'Omniscience-immutability Arguments', American Philosophical Quarterly, xxm (1986), 319-35; Patrick Grim, 'Against Omniscience: the Case from Essential Indexicals', Nous, xix (1985), 151-80. 2 Cf. Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles I, 21, 45.</page><page sequence="20">208 BRIAN LEFTOW One can derive a conclusion even more repugnant to theists as follows. X' observing y requires that y causally contribute to x experience rather than that j cause [simpliciter) x experience because in ordinary human cases, the causal contribution of y is necessary but not sufficient for the existence of observational knowledge. My observation of you, for instance, is caused not only by you but by the light which you reflect and the operation of my nerves, and it also requires the operation of the relevant natural laws. But virtually all theists will grant that God's knowledge does not depend on physical intermediaries or the operation of natural laws. In these and some other relevant senses, God's knowledge is immediate. If so, it arguable is the case that the contribution ofy would be necessary and sufficient for the existence of divine observational knowledge: thatjy would not just causally contribute to but cause that knowledge's existence. If so, then we have our repugnant conclusion : if a simple deity observes the universe, the universe causes God to exist. Again, as no theist will accept the consequent of this conditional, no theist can ascribe literal observational knowledge to a simple God. This leads to a more general point. If anything on which a simple God causally depends for knowledge causally contributes to His existence, He can causally depend for knowledge on nothing He creates. For if He did, then given the transitivity of the relation 'causally contributes to', it would follow that He causally contributes to His own existence, which is impossible. Hence no created thing can causally contribute to a simple God's knowledge. A simple God cannot in any sense receive knowledge from created things. On the other hand, nothing unable to have knowledge of temporal things and events can count as the Western theistic God. So theists must either find a way to ascribe such knowledge to a simple being or reject the claim that God is simple (and with it the doctrine of divine eternity). How then can a simple being know what exists and occurs in time? Apparently, if a simple God knows these things and events, either there is no causal relation at all between God's knowledge and temporalia or His knowledge somehow causes the temporalia. Yet it is hard to see how God could have knowledge about temporal things at all if there were no causal connection between His belief state and the subject-matter of His beliefs. We surely do not want to say that pure logic is somehow really effective here ('God knows what exists and occurs in time because He is essentially omniscient and therefore logically must know this'). If we do not say this and there is no causal connection between God's belief-state and the subjects of God's beliefs, God's knowledge seems left as a cosmic coincidence (if anything thus coincidental could even count as knowledge). So we seem to have to say that a simple God's knowledge somehow causes the temporal events and entities of which He has knowledge. The natural and perhaps only possible construal of this is that God acquires His beliefs about temporal events by being aware of that in Himself (e.g. a state of His will) which effects it that the propositions</page><page sequence="21">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 209 expressing His beliefs are true (at their proper time). That is, if God's beliefs about temporal events and things cannot be founded on a causal connection by which these events and things produce these beliefs in Him, perhaps the only connection between God's beliefs and the events can be that God somehow produces the facts which render His beliefs true, and is directly aware of His doing so or having done so.1 If this is so, we can understand how God acquires His beliefs only if we can understand how He has effects in time. But we have suggested that to make sense of how an eternal God can have effects in time, we must first work out a simultaneity relation between atemporal causes and temporal effects. Kretzmann and Stump agree: we need... a simultaneity relationship between two relata of which one is eternal and the other temporal. We have to be able to characterize such a relation coherently if we are to be able to claim that there is any connection between an eternal and a temporal entity or event... ET-simultaneity is a sufficient condition of the possibility of a causal connection... between an eternal and a temporal entity or event.2 If so, it may be that no attempt to use God's knowledge of temporal things to work out an ET-simultaneity relation can succeed. For it may be that any such attempt will be implicitly circular: at some level, it may lean on a prior grasp of ET-simultaneity. Moreover, leaving aside any speculations about the mechanics of an eternal being's knowledge, just because they invoke observation, (ii) and (iii) seem implicitly circular. For all x and y, x observes y only if y causally contributes to x having a certain experience : causality figures in the analysis of the concept of observation. As backward causation is (I take it) impossible, then, events of observing must occur simultaneous with or later than events or states observed.3 According to Kretzmann and Stump, an eternal entity or event cannot be earlier... than... any temporal entity or event... any relationship between what is eternal and what is temporal... must be some species of simultaneity.4 So in analysing ET-causal relations or in explaining how they are even possible, we must invoke ET-simultaneity. But then any definition of 1 For a discussion which makes more fully some points I develop briefly here, see William Mann's 4 Epistemology Supernaturalized', Faith and Philosophy n (1985), 436-56. If my argument is correct, then it may be that only by having ' middle knowledge ' (knowledge 'in advance ' of what an agent A would freely do if placed in a situation) could a simple God have knowledge of the actions of created agents who possess libertarian freedom. An unrelated point : there can in fact be at most one eternal being, as whatever is eternal is simple, and as we have seen, there can be at most one simple being. If there can be at most one eternal being, and if an eternal being knows whatever it knows about temporal things by apprehending itself, Stump and Kretzmann's original (ii) is satisfied in any eternal being's having knowledge of any temporal thing. 2 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. n. 1, 435, 451. 3 Thus if precognition is possible, it is not a sort of observation, and is not so just because the events precognized occur later than their precognition. 4 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. n. 1, 435.</page><page sequence="22">210 BRIAN LEFTOW ET-simultaneity which brings in observation or other causally-implicated knowledge is implicitly circular, for to analyse fully the concept of such knowledge or the conditions under which such knowledge is possible, we must bring in the concept of ET-simultaneity. One may add : it is hard to see how knowledge not involving causal connection would be at all relevant to the question of simultaneity. Hence Stump and Kretzmann's approach, as so far construed, may be misguided au fond. But perhaps all these comments are misplaced, (ii) and (iii) refer to observers only because a standard relativistic definition of distant simul? taneity does so: two events at a distance are said to be simultaneous in a frame of reference just in case within that frame, light-signals from those events reach an observer at the mid-point between those two events simul? taneously.1 But the reference to an observer is inessential. One can rephrase this definition as follows : two events E and E* are distantly simultaneous in a frame of reference just in case within that frame, event ?** (E's light-signal reaching midpoint P) caused by E and event ?*** (which is E*'s light signal reaching midpoint P) caused by ?* are locally simultaneous. Local simultaneity is understood to be directly observed or observable simul? taneity, and being clear on what is and is not observable can be important in discussing the epistemic status of certain assertions of relativity theory ; thus the reference to an observer in the original definition. So perhaps for Stump and Kretzmann's purposes, the only important thing in this definition is that light-signals would coincide temporally at the mid-point; we can ignore their talk of a possible observer, taking it as an anthropomorphism for some appropriate causally-based relation between eternal and temporal events involving x,y, A and B. Thus perhaps we can alter the Stump?Kretzmann definition to (i) either x is eternal andjy is temporal, or vice versa; and (iv) at point A, in the unique eternal reference-frame, x and y are both present - i.e. either x is eternally present and y is causally related as temporally present, or vice versa; and (v) at point i?, in one of the infinitely many temporal reference-frames, x andjy are both present, i.e. either x is causally related as eternally present and y is temporally present, or vice-versa. Here we again hit a problem of circularity. We have suggested (as do Stump and Kretzmann) that to explain ET-causal relations or their possibility, one will have to invoke ET-simultaneity. If one does, one cannot also use ET causality to explain the latter relations. If we delete the mention of causality, then x and y are ET-simultaneous just in case 1 For discussion of this definition's basis, problems and implications, cf. Wesley Salmon, Space, Time and Motion, 2nd ed. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1980), chs. 3, 4, esp. p. 73, and Lawrence Sklar, Space, Time and Spacetime (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), pp. 276-94, esp. p. 277.</page><page sequence="23">THE ROOTS OF ETERNITY 211 (i) either x is eternal and y is temporal, or vice versa; and (vi) in the unique eternal reference-frame, x and y are both present - i.e. either x is eternally present and y is temporally present, or vice versa ; and (vii) in one of the infinitely many temporal reference-frames, x andjy are both present, i.e. either x is eternally present andjy is temporally present, or vice-versa. But how can an eternal thing be eternally present in a temporal frame, or a temporal thing temporally present in an eternal frame? According to Stump and Kretzmann, this cannot involve a temporal thing's literally being in eternity or an eternal thing's literally being in time, for this would make the temporal thing eternal and the eternal thing temporal.1 Stump and Kretzmann also hold that this cannot involve a third overarching framework, in addition to time and eternity, in which both eternal and temporal things can exist or occur.2 Yet if our ET-relation is to be any kind of simultaneity-relation, the two things must somehow be co-present, and to avoid circularity, this co-presence must be explicable without recourse to ET-simultaneity. We seem to have reached an impasse. To save the concept of ET-simultaneity, then, one must either explain it without appealing to ET-causation or to an eternal God's knowledge or will of temporal things, or take ET-simultaneity as somehow primitive and not further to be analysed, or jettison the assumption that ET-simultaneity is conceptually prior to and helps to explain ET-causation or the possibility of ET-causation. I suggest that the third is the most promising strategy. If one adopts this strategy, the conceptually most economical moves would be to take ET-causation as at least relatively primitive and explain ET simultaneity in terms or it, or else to explain both in terms of some third rela? tively primitive concept. I do not know what this third concept could be, though, and so taking ET-causality as relatively primitive and as the basis of ET-simultaneity seems the more appealing alternative. Taking ET-causality as the basis of ET-simultaneity may initially seem counter-intuitive. But it accords well with the fact that if God is eternal, there are temporal relata for ET-relations only because an eternal God creates them. For if this is the way ET-causality and ET-simultaneity are really related, it makes sense to use the former to explain the latter. The view that one must use ET-simultaneity to explain ET-causation (Or the possi? bility of ET-causation) parallels the widespread belief that temporal con? cepts are more primitive than causal, i.e. that one must use temporal con? cepts in explaining causal relations (or their possibility) and so cannot in turn explain these temporal concepts causally. But some philosphers deny this claim about time and causality. Advocates of causal theories of time claim to base temporal relations on causal relations. So a causal theory of 1 Stump and Kretzmann, op. cit. n. i, 436. 2 Ibid.</page><page sequence="24">212 BRIAN LEFTOW ET-relations would not be wholly without parallel. Further, giving a causal theoretic explanation of temporal order, in particular, would require one to produce an analysis of causal order which does not invoke temporal order. If this could be done, perhaps it would also be possible to analyse causal relations between eternal and temporal entities without invoking ET simultaneity. Doing this would provide us with a way to include causal relations in a definition of ET-simultaneity without circularity. It may be, then, that something along the lines of (i), (iv) and (v) can serve to define simultaneity between the eternal and the temporal ; at least nothing said in this essay rules this out. Of course, for anything like (i), (iv) and (v) to be viable, one must spell out fully the relevant causal relations. As I do not know whether or just how this could be done, I do not know whether the concept of ET-simultaneity can be saved.
