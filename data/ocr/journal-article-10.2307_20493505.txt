The artist, Antony Gormley, says 'My work is to make bodies into vessels that both contain and occupy space'. Situated in the campus of the University of Limerick between the library, the main humanities building and the University Concert Hall, the sculp ture has become an integral part of stu dent life, forming part of their daily landscape. Unlike much public outdoor sculpture, the scale of the sculpture is like that of a human figure and thus does not impose over the environment in which it is placed. This placement, rigorously worked out by Gormley himself, is signifi cant as the library quadrangle, enclosed on the other side by Tom Fitzgerald's mag nificent Tree of Life, is a popular space for students and staff on their way to the heart of any university, its library. The anthropomorphic nature of the piece itself is not surprising, as it is similar to Gormley's famous body cast series of the 1980s. One of a series of five,' it was not commissioned for the University, and thus cannot be said to have been created for its current site. However, the artist himself chose the most appropriate place for the placement of his work, situating the figure in the diagonal sight line of the library building. 'Space exists outside the door and inside the head. My work is to make a human being in space.'2 Gormley's intention, beautifully achieved, was that the figure would act as a link between the main university build ings and the library, and thus connect the collective activities of teaching, learning and administration contained in the lec ture rooms, laboratories and offices of the former with the solitary, contemplative nature of scholarship represented by the latter. The very title of the sculpture Together and Apart can be said to repre sent the essence of university scholarship which is dependent upon both the exchange of ideas within the intellectual community and individual creativity. In a survey conducted by one of the MA students in the History of Art and Architecture at the University, Yvonne Davis, students responded that they saw the figure as lonely, forlorn, sad, heart breaking and isolated. As the figure itself, although human in form, has no individ ualised features this response is evoked by the sight of a still human form in a wide open space - a space that the form itself makes the viewer aware of by its pres ence. In his interview with Ernst Gombrich, Gormley talked about his awareness of space beginning as a child when, as he closed his eyes to sleep, he became aware of the internal space behind his eyes being suffocating and claustrophobic, expanding then until it became enormous.3 Space and the body is a recurrent theme with Gormley whose work often deals with inner space, the space around that body, and our aware ness of the relationships thus created. The collections of the University of Limerick are rich and varied, but this is perhaps the piece that occupies an iconic status, with students frequently arranging to meet and choosing to be photographed beside it on their graduation days. Its pres ence in the campus rather than within a designated gallery or museum space allows its integration into the daily life of the university, as a familiar and much loved piece, although at times its apparent loneliness disturbs. - CATHERINE LAWLESS is Course Director of the MA in History of Art and Architecture at the University of Limerick.
