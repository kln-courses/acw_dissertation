<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Apuleius’ Cupid Considered   as a Lamia (Metamorphoses 5.17–18) d. feLton This paper re-examines what many scholars have seen as the problematic  intrusion of the monstrous serpent into the narrative of Cupid and Psyche.  Psyche seems far too easily convinced by her sisters that her unseen husband  is a horrendous creature intent on devouring her. Psyche’s extreme credulity,  terror, and willingness to kill her husband are more understandable if her  reaction is interpreted in the context of Lamia lore, with which Apuleius and  his audience were clearly familiar. Relevant evidence includes Dio’s fifth  Oration and Philostratus’ Life of Apollonius, as well as tales of anguipedal  males such as Typhoeus and Cecrops. In Apuleius’ story of Cupid and Psyche (Met. 4.28–6.24), Psyche’s envious  sisters, wishing to destroy her marital relationship, tell her they know for certain  that her husband is an immense serpent (immanem . . . serpentem) dripping  deadly poison from its bloody jaws (5.17.3).1 They report that people in the area  have seen him returning from feeding and bathing in the nearby river, and they  claim that he is only pampering her and feeding her such rich meals to fatten  her and her unborn baby before devouring them both (5.17.4–18.1). Right after  hearing this, Psyche, whom Apuleius describes at this point as simplex et animi  tenella (“simple, and tender of mind,” meaning not only “naïve” but also pos- sibly “immature” or even “feebleminded,” 5.18.4), is terrified and completely  taken in. But why is Apuleius’ Psyche suddenly so willing to believe that her  unseen but so far very loving husband is a monstrous serpent fattening her up  to devour her? She has touched him frequently and often heard him speak. Even  Apollo’s oracle, which foretold Psyche’s marriage to someone saeuum atque  ferum uipereumque malum, “savage and fierce, snakelike and wicked,” was  intentionally ambiguous (4.33.1), signaling for the audience, at least, many of  Love’s traditional attributes—particularly when the oracle states that even Jove  comes under the creature’s control (4.33.2).2 Psyche’s credulity upon hearing   1.

As Wright (1971) 274 points out, the snake motif fits with the various descriptions of Cupid  229 </page> <page sequence="2"> 230 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) her sisters’ falsehoods really goes well beyond the simplicitas usually attrib- uted to her character. Wright has argued that “the pedantic objection that she  should be aware that she has not been sleeping with a serpent is irrelevant in  the literary world either of Apuleius or of the folk-tale.”3 But such a dismissal  is unsatisfactory. Winkler, for example, notes the “problematic intrusion” of  the “demon serpent” into the story, and Kenney objects that Apuleius greatly  compounds the improbabilities of the plot in this section of the narrative.4 Zim- merman et al. note that it is difficult to understand how Psyche can possibly  believe her sisters: “the question as to how this is possible has puzzled many.  She should know better,” since she has tactile knowledge of her husband, so the  sisters’ rhetoric must have been exceptionally effective.5 Scholarly objection  remains quite relevant given that a major plot point hinges on such an appar- ently ridiculous oversight.6 This paper argues that Psyche’s extreme credulity  as “savage or beast-like” in Greek literature. Cf. Kenney (1990a) 131–32; Kenney (1990b) at 175  and 181. For a counter-argument to this see Zimmerman et al. (2004) 88. Winkler (1985) 91 and  Zimmerman et al. (2004) 86 note the parallel between Psyche on the cliff and Andromeda on the  rocks, awaiting a terrible serpentine creature; Zimmerman et al. also cite the parallel of Hesione.  The specific folk-motif is Thompson (1955–58) B11.10, “sacrifice of human to a dragon.”  3. Wright (1971) 274. That is, of the folk-tale upon which the Cupid and Psyche story is believed  to be based. Folktales are common in Apuleius, as Scobie (1983) in particular has demonstrated,  while Swahn (1955) has listed the many individual motifs specifically within the tale of Cupid  and Psyche and catalogued hundreds of worldwide folkloric analogues to the tale–type. See also  discussion in Friedländer (1968) for variants on the Cupid and Psyche tale (e.g., the Indian story  of Tulisa and Basnak Dau).  4. Winkler (1985) 91; Kenney (1990a) 162. Moreover, in many variants of folktale type ATU  425, “The Search for the Lost Husband” (for which see Uther [2004]), the bride is well aware that  her husband is a monster, but unaware that he is magically enchanted and really a prince. See also  Thompson (1955–58) motifs B640.1, “Marriage to beast by day and man by night,” and D621.1,  “Animal by day; man by night.” In contrast, in ATU 425M, “The Snake as Bridegroom,” the oth- erworldly husband usually has no human form.  5. Zimmerman et al. (2004) 236–37.  6. Winkler (1985) 92 argues that the sisters’ lie actually makes sense out of the available in- formation, accounting “not only for the oracle and the lover’s rule of invisibility but also for his  insistence on her cooperation and obedience.” He stresses that Psyche’s being persuaded by her  sisters’ version “is not just curiosity or foolishness but is rather a real temptation and intellectually  justified” as the sisters’ story “unites the opposed possibilities that Psyche is the bride and victim”  of the dragon, who wants both a consort and a meal, and for the latter needs Psyche to wait until  her pregnancy reaches its peak. But none of this sufficiently addresses Psyche’s physical knowledge  of her husband. Zimmerman et al. (2004) 243 suggest that the sisters’ rhetoric is effective because  the words they have used to “awaken in Psyche disgust for her intimacy with the unknown maritus  apparently have more impact than her own sensual experience” (see discussion below on Psyche’s  tactile experiences), and because there are other instances in the Met. where people “who should  </page> <page sequence="3">  D. Felton 231 and terror are much more understandable if we interpret her reaction not simply  via the general folkloric tale-type of “The Monster as Bridegroom,”7 but more  specifically in light of serpent-spouse folktales, particularly the ancient Lamia  legend—a story very familiar to Apuleius and his audience. The Lamia Legend In ancient Greek folklore, Lamia was a name given to a kind of daimon that  was believed to kill infants.8 She was possibly related to the Near Eastern Li- lith figure.9 Ancient Greek literary references to Lamia, though frequent, lack  detail until the late Hellenistic period, when Lamia began to figure in a story  eventually known as the “Libyan Myth.”10 The tale became increasingly elabo- rate throughout the Roman era. In one of the story’s oldest attestations, from  Diodorus Siculus (first century Bce), a cave in Libya was the birthplace of  Lamia, an exceptionally beautiful queen. But when all her children died, she was  so devastated by the misfortune that she began to envy women who did have  children, and ordered all newborn babies in her realm to be killed. Diodorus  says that because of her cruel spirit her face, over time, took on a bestial aspect  (ὄψιν θηριώδη, Diod. Sic. 20.41.3), and her name even in Diodorus’s own time  was used to frighten children.11 But during the Roman Empire, Lamia gradu- ally changed in the literature from an infant-killing spirit to a sexual monster  that seduced and devoured young men, and her ophidian characteristics began  to appear. Dio Chrysostom, for example, in the first century ce, devoted his  entire fifth Oration to a retelling of the Libyan myth in which the Lamia is a  savage animal native to Libya that preys upon beasts such as lions and panthers  know better let themselves be deceived by lies.” But in the former statement Zimmerman et al.  present a glitch in their own argument (“apparently”), and regarding the latter, there is no question  that Psyche has allowed herself to be deceived—the question is still why.  7. Subsumed under ATU 425B, “Son of the Witch.”  8. Child-killing spirits such as Lamia (along with Empousa and Mormo) were originally com- monly used as bogeymen to frighten children into obedience. Some of the many examples of this  include Hor. Ars 340; Plut. Mor. 515f–516a; and Str. 1.2.8. See Scobie (1979) 244–51; Resnick and  Kitchell (2007) 98n28.  9. See, e.g., West (1991).  10. Mainly via the version told by Dio Chrysostom; see below.  11. Diodorus does not attribute any serpentine features to Lamia, though in his very next section  he describes the poisonous snakes of the Libyan desert (20.42.1–2). In some versions, Lamia, the  daughter of a Libyan king, was seduced by Zeus on account of her beauty and bore him several  children, whom an envious Hera later killed. This caused Lamia to turn cruel and kill the children  of other women. For this and other variants, see Johnston (1999) 174n27; also Resnick and Kitchell  (2007) 81. </page> <page sequence="4"> 232 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) but especially enjoys catching men, mainly shipwrecked sailors (Dio Chrys.  Or. 5.7–11). Dio does not specifically call the creatures lamiae, but there has  been no question about their identification. He describes this Libyan creature  as having the face of a woman, along with a woman’s neck and breasts, all very  beautiful; but the lower part of her body, hidden in the sand, was that of a ser- pent (5.12–13). These lamiae would overcome beasts by force, but rather than  hunting men would instead lure them in by revealing at first only their upper,  female parts.12 As soon as a man came close enough the serpent portion would  seize and devour him, as the lower half ended in a serpent’s head.13 Given such  stories, lamiae may have been creatures intended to help define negatively what a  female’s role in society should be, as Johnston has argued: a female should mate  with young men, not kill them; she should produce babies, not devour them.14 A Lamia Legend in Circulation Probably the best known Lamia story from antiquity is that in Philostratus’ Life  of Apollonius of Tyana (V A 4.25; early third century ce). Here, a young phi- losophy student named Menippus is seduced by a lamia who appears to him as  a beautiful, wealthy young woman but who actually wishes “to fatten him with  pleasures” before devouring him.15 He abandons the philosophical school and   12. The image is reminiscent of certain depictions of the Theban Sphinx, who was occasionally  envisioned as having not only a female head but female breasts on a lion’s torso, as for example  on the pediment of Building H at Xanthos (ca. 470–450 Bce); also a Greek terracotta sphinx from  South Italy, late fifth century Bce, currently in the Freud Museum, London (FM4387). An Attic vase  found at Kameiros is said to represent a meeting between the Sphinx and Lamia; see Resnick and  Kitchell (2007) 81. But the painting that most calls to mind Dio’s story is Jean-Auguste-Dominique  Ingres’ “Oedipus and the Sphinx” (1808), in which Oedipus appears to be speaking directly to the  Sphinx’s breasts rather than to her face.  13. Antoninus Liberalis 8 provides yet another variant on the Lamia story, presenting a “beast”  called Lamia or Sybaris who lives in a cave on Mt. Cirphis near Parnassus. Every day the creature  would emerge to devour livestock and people, until the locals, advised by the Delphic Oracle, of- fered a young man to the monster. The youth was saved by another young man who fell in love with  him, took his place, and threw the monster to her death. On this story, see Celoria (1992) 128–30.  14. Johnston (1995) 366–69.  15. Philostratus refers to the creature as a phantom (φάσμα) and as “one of the empousai, whom  most people call lamiae and mormolykes” (μία τῶν ἐμπουσῶν ἐστιν, ἃς λαμίας τε καὶ μορμολυκίας  οἱ πολλοὶ ἡγοῦνται, Philostr. V A 4.25). Phasma is one of the more generic terms for supernatural  creatures (for discussion see Felton [1999] 23–24), whereas the other terms Philostratus uses all refer  to creatures, usually “female, or at least partly female,” who were known as shapeshifters and who had  an appetite for human flesh (Scobie [1979] 246–47). In another, much shorter story, Philostratus tells  of Apollonius’s encounter with a similar shapeshifting creature, calling it the phasma of an empousa  (φάσμα . . . ἐμπούσης, 2.4). Apollonius simply berated the creature and told his friends to do the  same, upon which the thing fled with a shrill cry, “as apparitions do” (ὥσπερ τὰ εἴδωλα, 2.4). </page> <page sequence="5">  D. Felton 233 moves into her mansion, which is actually just an illusion of luxury created by  her magic. Menippus sees dishes and cups of silver and gold, drinks the finest  wines, and is waited on by a vast number of servants. But the esteemed miracle  worker Apollonius discerns the Lamia’s true nature and tells Menippus, “you  are cherishing a snake and a snake is cherishing you” (ὄφιν θάλπεις καὶ σὲ  ὄφις). Apollonius may mean this literally with respect to the creature’s true  form, but certainly is also using the term in the metaphorical sense that snakes  are untrustworthy and dangerous creatures.16 Apollonius attends the wedding  at the Lamia’s house and confronts her, at which the gold and silver and wine  and servants all disappear, having been mere illusions. The moral seems to be  that only philosophical discipline can conquer the allure of worldly pleasure.  As Anderson explains, this story contains the stereotyped motif of the disciple  brought down to earth by his master, and ashamed of his worldly attachments.  It is the typical philosopher’s rebuke to a backsliding pupil, who has deluded  himself into thinking that he can have a lasting relationship with a courtesan  living beyond her means and on the lookout for gullible clients.17 Moreover,  Anderson continues, “it would be a natural literary conceit for Apollonius to  present such a person as preparing to devour her victim, and a display of bor- rowed wealth as ‘disappearing’ after her exposure.”18  Various aspects of Apuleius’s Cupid and Psyche story appear in Philostratus’  tale. Although the Lamia in the Apollonius version does not definitively have  a snaky form, Apollonius does refer to her twice as a snake (ὄφις). In both  stories the “spouses”—the unseen Cupid in Apuleius, the unrecognized Lamia  in  Philostratus—are extraordinarily rich, owning palatial homes full of gold,  silver, and other fabulous decorative items. Both homes are full of innumer- able servants: invisible handmaidens in Apuleius; a huge number of cooks,  wine-stewards, and various other servants in the Lamia’s suburban mansion.  The feasts and particularly the wine in both places are unusually exquisite and  plentiful. More disturbingly, the Lamia in Philostratus’s story admits to Apol- lonius that she has been feasting her lover in order to fatten him up before eating  him. Psyche’s sisters say exactly the same thing about her unseen husband: the   16. In classical mythology, the danger posed by typical snakes (as opposed to dragons) appears,  for example, in the myth of Heracles (who as an infant strangled two snakes sent by Hera to kill  him) and in the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (the latter of whom died of snakebite). Clytemnes- tra dreams that she birthed a snake, offered it her breast to suckle, and was bitten (betrayed) by it  (Aesch. Cho. 527–33).  17. Anderson (1986) 141.  18. Anderson (1986) 141–42. </page> <page sequence="6"> 234 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) monstrous serpent is really fattening her up and, as soon as her pregnancy is at  its peak, the creature will devour her (5.18).19  Philostratus’s version of the Apollonius story was written several decades later  than Apuleius’ Metamorphoses, which dates to the second half of the second  century ce, while Apollonius himself lived during the first century ce. The  story of Apollonius unmasking the Lamia was thus very probably circulating  before Apuleius’s time, possibly influencing his Cupid story; Dio’s Oration  was certainly published before either work and so was also a likely influence.  Philostratus himself indicates that the story of Apollonius and the Lamia was  already well known, and that he is giving an enhanced version of his own.20  Alternatively, whether Philostratus wrote the details of the Apollonius story  himself, or whether he was working with a folktale, he could very well also  have been drawing on Apuleius, if he recognized characteristics of the Lamia in  Apuleius’s Cupid. Yet another possibility, quite common in folkloric transmis- sion, is that both authors were independently drawing on a traditional, orally  circulating Lamia tale that involved the supernatural creature ensnaring a mortal  by means of material wealth. Apuleius’ Use of Lamia Lore We do know for certain that Apuleius was quite familiar with the Lamia as a  figure of Greek and Roman folklore. As Resnick and Kitchell note, “Apuleius  was quite taken with her.”21 Lamiae figure in Apuleius’ Metamorphoses in several  ways. Many common characteristics link the story’s witches—Meroe, Panthia,  and Pamphile—with the Lamia, as Resnick and Kitchell, as well as Leinwe- ber discuss in some detail.22 And the character Aristomenes specifically calls  Meroe and Panthia lamiae, though intending the term as an insult rather than  as a literal label (Met. 1.17). Later, Cupid refers to Psyche’s sisters as lamiae,  though again the term is used insultingly rather than literally (Met. 5.11). Yet in  these cases the term has not only the sense of a malice-bearing shrew but also  indicates that these are characters who prey on other, weaker characters and do  so by initially appearing to be what they are not. Elford has noted the irony in   19. This similarity was noted but not pursued by Purser (1983) 48.  20. As Scobie (1977b) 9 puts it, “Philostratus himself is apologetic about including the Lamia- tale in his biography of Apollonius and excuses its inclusion on the grounds that his source ‘Damis’  told it (4.25 ad fin.).” See also Anderson (2009) 220–21.  21. Resnick and Kitchell (2007) 83.  22. Leinweber (1994) 77. His interpretation of the story of Meroe and Socrates as a Lamia tale  (78–79) is also adopted by Resnick and Kitchell (2007) 82–83. </page> <page sequence="7">  D. Felton 235 Cupid’s reference to the sisters as lamiae, since they later falsely accuse him of  being a serpent intending to devour a baby—his own unborn child.23  In several respects, then, various aspects of the Lamia legend apply to the  character of Cupid as invented by Psyche’s sisters. The details in the sisters’  false story seem specifically intended to evoke a monstrous being very similar  to the deceptive, serpentine Lamia, who appears to be human but whose true  form is mainly that of a venomous snake. Both Psyche’s husband and the Lamia  are immortal creatures that seduce mortals, first attracting them with material  luxury.24 Here we have to keep in mind that although Psyche originally ended up  in Cupid’s palace because she submitted to the oracle, her unseen husband does  alleviate her initial grief and terror (4.35.4) and seduce her into complacence  with the calm, reassuring, and visually stunning environment of both her journey  with Zephyr and her arrival at the domus regia: after seeing the vast treasures,  having a refreshing bath, eating a wonderful meal, and listening to beautiful  music, Psyche has overcome her terror (4.35.4–5.1–3). She is frightened again  her first night in the palace (when she is essentially raped), but soon the routine  becomes pleasant to her, as she is continually soothed by the invisible voices  and the wonderful surroundings (5.4.5).  Furthermore, although the Lamia may seduce men largely through her volup- tuous appearance, as in Dio and Philostratus, she also relies on her voice and  on persuasive speech to gain control over her lover, very much as Cupid does.  In Philostratus, for example, the creature says many things in an attempt to lure  Menippus. She falsely claims that she is rich and that she has loved Menippus  for a long time. She promises to sing for him and to be only his.25 The young  man is seduced by these words (τούτοις ὑπαχθεὶς ὁ νεανίας, V A 4.25). Also,  like Dio’s lamiae, Psyche’s allegedly monstrous husband feeds on animals in  the neighboring region, according to her sisters’ false report (5.17.4).  23. Elford (2012) 82. This passage is not the only reference to the sisters that involves snake- imagery: cf. uipereum uirus (“snaky poison,” 5.12.3). As Panayotakis (1998) 160–61 observes, this  section “is remarkable for the dominant snake-imagery, present in the sisters’ lethal breath . . . and  in their identification with the Furies.” Regarding the unborn child, at no point in the narrative do  any of the characters—Psyche or her sisters—consider the possibility that if Psyche’s husband is a  monster, the child might also be monstrous.  24. Leinweber (1994) 77 notes the very general correspondence of the theme in both Philostratus’  and Apuleius’ stories in which “a nice young person met and fell in love with a seemingly charming  stranger, who was later found to possess horrible, and even evil, attributes.”  25. Song, of course, is a common method of enchantment (as the etymology of that word also  indicates), an early example being Homer’s Sirens. (Like Cupid, the Sirens are not seen but are  only heard.) </page> <page sequence="8"> 236 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) Psyche’s Serpentine Spouse The sisters, however, do not seem to have worked out the details of their story  very well. They soon tell Psyche that this monstrous serpent has been sleeping  with her during the nights without her discovering it (serpentem . . . tecum  noctibus latenter adquiescere, 5.17.3). It is never entirely clear whether the  sisters mean that the unseen husband keeps his serpentine form at night, or  that he takes on a deceptively attractive form at night just for Psyche, since, as  they have just claimed, other people have seen him in the daylight as a snake.  The sisters are taking a risk in their elaborate falsehood, given that Psyche  should have tactile information about her husband, as many commentators have  observed.26 In fact, the narrative really goes far out of its way to stress that,  even if Psyche cannot see her husband, she has intimate physical information.  For example, at 5.5.1, “there was nothing of him” that Psyche did not become  acquainted with through the senses of touch and hearing, even if she could not  see him (praeter oculos et manibus et auribus eius nihil non sentiebatur). The  narrative also frequently describes the couple as embracing,27 and at 5.13.3  Psyche lists several specific physical attributes of her unseen husband: his  fragrant, dependent locks of hair (cinnameos et undique pendulos crines); his  soft, smooth cheeks, which are—quite notably—similar to hers (teneras et  teretis et mei similes genas); and his warm chest (pectus feruidum).28 Winkler  suggests that the emphasis on Psyche’s being able to feel her husband when  they make love may lead us to think of an “anthropomorphic god condemned  to a snaky appearance only by day”.29 But although this would explain why  Psyche’s husband never presented himself to her during the day, it would not  explain (to those who hadn’t guessed that her husband is a god) why Psyche  was not allowed to see her husband at night.  26. And despite Wright’s objection. See n6 above.  27. E.g., 5.6.1, of Cupid to Psyche; 5.6.3, of the couple; 5.6.9, of Psyche to Cupid.  28. The narrative mentions Cupid’s hair again at 5.13.6, when he dries her tears with his locks  (lacrimasque eius suis crinibus detergens). Winkler (1985) 91 tentatively suggests that Cupid’s  long hair, soft cheeks, and strangely warm breast “might be serpent features misinterpreted as hu- man,” though one is hard pressed to find descriptions of serpents in antiquity that conform to these  parameters. In fact, ancient drakontes were more likely to be envisioned as bearded rather than as  having soft, smooth cheeks, particularly in art but also in literature, including Philostratus (Ogden  [2013] 155–61).  29. Winkler (1985) 91. As noted above, this sort of enchantment occurs in some variants of ATU  425. Zimmerman et al. cite James’ supposition (1987) 172 that Psyche “is led to believe that her  snake-husband ‘must magically transform himself each night in order to masquerade as a man.  Even Psyche’s simplicitas could not allow her to ignore her own sensuous experience.’” </page> <page sequence="9">  D. Felton 237  We can, however, consider the possibility that, since the upper body of a  lamia was human, Psyche’s embrace of her husband did not feel suspicious.  The sisters specifically describe the monstrous serpent as having “bloody jaws  dripping deadly poison,” but that is characteristic of the lower, serpent half of  Dio’s Libyan lamiae, for example—they use their serpent jaws to sting and kill  with poison (Dio Chrys. Or. 5.15). Based on her sisters’ descriptions, Psyche may  now be imagining her husband as an anguipede. Such creatures include not only  Dio’s lamiae, but some of the more famous monsters of Greek mythology—both  male and female—including Echidna, described by Hesiod as half nymph, half  snake (Th. 298–99); Typhoeus, whom Apollodorus (but not Hesiod) describes  as a mixture of man and beast, having “gigantic coils of snakes from his thighs  down” (τὰ δὲ ἀπὸ μηρῶν σπείρας εἶχεν ὑπερμεγέθεις ἐχιδνῶν, Bibl. 1.6.3);30  and Cecrops, who had a combination man-serpent body (συμφυὲς ἔχων σῶμα  ἀνδρὸς καὶ δράκοντος, Bibl. 3.14.1).31 Psyche’s sisters do not seem to have  had an anguipede in mind, but their description is general enough to allow for  the possibility that Psyche might envision her unseen (and so far unnamed)  husband as such. It is also possible that Psyche might imagine her husband to  be a creature similar to the Lamia who appears in Philostratus: rather than being  anguipedal, like Dio’s lamiae, this one is a shapeshifter and can change entirely  into human form. This, though, would still not explain to Psyche why she was  not allowed to see his form even at night. Her sisters already strongly suspect  that Psyche’s husband is an immortal god who is hiding his true identity from  her, but Psyche remains clueless on this point.  In any case, Psyche, as her sisters hoped, assumes a giant serpent has been  sleeping with her at night, noting that her husband must have a beastly form  since he shuns her presence during daylight (5.19.2). She seems convinced  that he is also a snake (or part snake) at night: instead of recalling what she has  clearly felt with her hands and body, she recalls the many warnings her husband  has issued that she not try to see him (e.g., 5.6.6 and 5.11.4), and remembers  her sisters’ points about the oracle and particularly about her husband using the  pleasures of the flesh to lull into complacency someone he wants to eat. The  sisters then advise Psyche to kill her husband by lamplight, giving her such a  detailed description that she will actually expect to see a serpent: they tell her  to strike where the serpent’s head and neck are joined (serpentis nodum ceruicis   30. Cf. also Antoninus Liberalis 28.  31. Cecrops is generally interpreted as having the upper body of a man and the lower body of a  serpent. Cecrops, notably, does not exhibit monstrous behavior, such as eating humans. The Giants  are regularly represented as anguipedal in art from the fourth century Bce on; see discussion in  Felton (2012) 111–12. </page> <page sequence="10"> 238 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) et capitis abscide, 5.20.5). (Note, too, that this passage would seem to void the  interpretation that Psyche’s husband was anthropomorphic at night, though it still  leaves open the possibility of an anguipedal spouse.)32 The sisters may be hoping  that Psyche’s heightened terror will cause her to imagine she sees a monster,33  or, more likely, that (as actually happens) her disobedience of her husband (not  to mention the attempted murder) will destroy the marital relationship. In any  case, the sisters’ lurid story was convincing enough that Psyche was apparently  quite ready to stab her spouse (5.22.1). A “Male” Lamia Story? Although the many corresponding themes and motifs of Lamia lore are, at this  point, enough to suggest that Apuleius saw a very strong association between  Cupid and Lamia, if we interpret the sisters’ story as being effective in part be- cause it alludes to the Lamia legend, we might also speculate as to whether the  sisters and Psyche (and the audience) would ever consider that such a creature  could be male. Lamiae with masculine, or at least hermaphroditic characteristics  were not unprecedented by Apuleius’ time. References in Aristophanes’ Wasps  (1035) and Peace (758) describe the Lamia as having an ugly face, a foul smell,  large breasts, and unwashed testicles.34 Such a creature has also tentatively  been identified as a lamia on several Greek vases.35 This creature, of course, is  far from the seductive type, and the fact that the main sources for a lamia with  testicles are satiric drama and uncertain representations in Greek painting does  not particularly help with the case of Psyche.36 But at the same time, we should  note that a certain level of gender switching does occur within the Cupid and  Psyche story in the character of Psyche herself. After wavering considerably  while contemplating the murder of her husband, she finally musters her courage  and, as the narrative says, “through boldness changes her sex” (sexum audacia  mutatur, 5.22.1).37 She also ends up taking on the typically male role of journey-  32. Zimmerman et al. (2004) 260 suggest that in ascribing to the body of a snake a ceruix, a  word more commonly used of human anatomy, the sister speaking these lines may again be hinting  at the anthropomorphic features of the monster.  33. In Ep. 7.27.8, Pliny the Younger describes this potential effect when the philosopher Athenodor- us, investigating an allegedly haunted house, keeps busy to avoid letting his imagination influence  what he sees.  34. On Lamia’s male characteristics, see Johnston (1995) 372–74; Resnick and Kitchell (2007) 81.  35. Resnick and Kitchell (2007) 81.  36. Though depending on how much Freudian interpretation one wishes to grant to ancient Greek  folktales, one could make a case for a connection between these alleged lamias’ testicles and the  snaky lower half of the more traditional Lamia.  37. Other translations than mine stress the gender switch more: for example, Psyche “in her daring  makes herself a man” (Relihan [2007] 105) or “took on a man’s courage” (Kenney [1990a] 75). </page> <page sequence="11">  D. Felton 239 quest hero, and in 6.5.3 even says to herself, masculum tandem sumis animum  (“assume a masculine courage,” or, in current parlance, “man up”).38 In short,  if the narrative can attribute masculine characteristics to Psyche,39 we cannot  be entirely surprised if it also places Cupid in a more traditionally female role,  that of a lamia.40 And, if we consider that Psyche is imagining an anguipedal  spouse, there are certainly male precedents for that, as discussed above (e.g.,  Cecrops). Perhaps more importantly, metamorphosis—physical, spiritual—  remains a central theme throughout the novel, and it would be surprising if  physical metamorphosis did not play a role (even an imaginary one) in the  Cupid and Psyche section, in the same way that various characters in this story  also undergo spiritual changes.  We can also adduce as evidence the presence in Apuleius of a different man- into-snake story, which appears in Met. 8.19–21. Here the group of travellers,  which includes Lucius in ass form, are greeted by a large but elderly man who  tearfully implores the group to pity his old age and help him retrieve his young  grandson, who, he claims, has fallen into a nearby pit (8.20). One of the travel- lers volunteers to help the old man. When the volunteer does not come back,  another man goes to find him and returns with a horrifying story. He says that he  had seen the first man lying on the ground while a monstrous dragon (immanem  draconem)41 had him pinned down and was eating his already half-devoured  body—but that the large old man was nowhere to be seen (8.21). The conclusion  that the old man and the dragon are one and the same is certainly supported by this  comment, as Scobie notes.42 He also points out that this story is most probably a  folktale, even though it has no analogue in surviving Greco-Roman literature.43   38. Lucius encourages himself similarly in 6.26. It cannot be argued that Psyche’s needing so  much help in her quest undermines this role-switching, as one could easily point out the amount of  help journey-quest heroes such as Odysseus and Jason received from the opposite sex.  39. It is also worth noting that Venus calls Psyche stelio (“lizard,” “gecko,” “snake,” “reptile,”  5.30.3), meaning someone untrustworthy (see Kenney [1990a] 186), though unlike draco and  serpens the word is not also used to denote a supernatural monster.  40. Apuleius does not write Cupid as feminine so much as childish (rather than manly), mainly  via the character of Venus (e.g., 5.28.7, 5.29.3). Psyche’s reference to her husband’s teneras et  teretis et mei similes genas is the nearest the narrative comes to describing him in feminine terms,  and the description is probably meant to indicate his anthropomorphism rather than any feminine  qualities.  41. As Ogden (2013) 2–4 observes, the Latin draco, like the Greek δράκων, tends to denote a  massive snake within some sort of supernatural context rather than denoting a real species of snake.  But he also notes that the Romans occasionally prefer their term serpens to the imported draco to  reference the same sort of creature. There is, consequently, no major distinction in Latin between  serpens and draco in regard to size, behavior, and context.  42. Scobie (1977a) 340.  43. There is a possibility that this serpent-creature is a type of guardian dragon, given that the  </page> <page sequence="12"> 240 Illinois Classical Studies 38 (2013) But in fact the story does share important characteristics with the Lamia legend,  presenting another shape-shifting snaky creature that lures men in, by means of  persuasive, emotional speech and by appearing to be something it is not.  In short, Psyche’s apparently extreme-even-for-her gullibility at her sisters’  story makes more sense when considered in the context of Greco-Roman  folktales such as those of the Lamia and of the shape-shifting dragon. Folk- tales may have influenced this fictional character’s state of mind; like many  children in the ancient Near Eastern and Greek worlds, she may have heard  stories of the Lamia and other human-devouring daimones.44 This would help  explain her bizarre credulity at this juncture in the story’s plot. If instead we  apply the well-worn but not unreasonable interpretation of Cupid as represent- ing worldly desires and Psyche as representing the soul, unused to tangible,  material attachments, we could suggest an interpretation similar to the one  applied to Philostratus’ story: on one level the sisters are rebuking Psyche for  growing complacent with material wealth and sex (even if they are envious of  it), and Psyche’s belief in their story represents her sudden realization that she  has been focusing on the wrong aspects of life. But this sort of interpretation  is not nearly as strongly suggested by the evidence as the Lamia legend is,  particularly given that, unlike Menippus and the Lamia, Psyche and Cupid  reunite and marry. Relating Cupid with Lamia in Later Literature In drawing our parallels between Apuleius’ Cupid and the Lamia of Greek legend,  we should also consider two significant later works that bear evidence of hav- ing interpreted the Cupid and Psyche story as containing a lamia element. The  first is the medieval French legend of Melusine, best known from a fourteenth- travelers are warned away from the region, as Apuleius uses serpents, the saeui dracones at 6.14,  to guard the waters of the Styx. Scobie (1977a) 340, though, does not see any similarities between  the creature in 8.19–21 and the main guardian dragons of Greek myth, such as the dragon that  guards the Golden Fleece, the dragon guarding the sacred spring of Ares near Cadmeia, or the  serpent guarding the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, not only because of its unspecified function  but because, unlike those more famous dragons, this one is a shapeshifter. Moreover, those other  guardian dragons do not go out of their way to kill or eat people. In short, travelers may be warned  from the region simply because people are known to meet mysterious deaths there (because the  creature has its lair nearby).  44. Charite, the character to whom the Cupid and Psyche story is being told, would similarly  have been familiar with such creatures, as would the old woman telling the story to Charite. Cf. the  old woman’s remarks (4.27). Scobie (1979) 244–51 and 256–58 discusses in detail the evidence  for the anilis fabula in antiquity, with particular attention to the Lamia story and to Apuleius’  Metamorphoses (though he does not connect the two). </page> <page sequence="13">  D. Felton 241 century romance by Jean D’Arras.45 In its basic form, the story parallels the Cupid  and Psyche tale-type, telling of “an ‘other-world’ lady who marries a mortal.”  She conceals her lineage and true identity from him. After she bears him many  sons, “her husband breaks a sworn oath and spies upon her in the bath; he is  shocked to behold his wife with her normal beauty from the waist upward, but  with serpent-form from the navel down. Upon being thus discovered, Melusine  fully metamorphoses into a winged dragon and flies out the window, never to  return.”46 Nichols notes the presence of the basic lamia tradition in the Melusine  story, but also points out Arras’ effort to make her benevolent.47 Arras’ version of  the Melusine story is essentially a political allegory, “showing the illusory nature  of English claims to the French throne,” written to please his powerful patron  (Jean, Duke of Berry, Count of Potiers, suzerain of Languedoc and Guyenne),48  but the influence of the Cupid and Psyche tale-type is clear both within the overall  narrative and in the underlying motifs.49  Second (and lastly) we should consider the intersection of the Cupid-Lamia  connection as it appears in John Keats’s 1819 poem Lamia. Keats was very  familiar with Greek myth and in particular with the story of Cupid and Psyche,  which he referenced in a number of his other poems.50 Although his Lamia was  essentially based on Philostratus’ story of Apollonius, the poem draws very  heavily on Apuleius’ Cupid and Psyche story and contains some particularly  striking parallels, as George Gross has demonstrated.51 Gross observes, among  other things, that “in the story of Cupid and Psyche as presented by Apuleius,  a god who sometimes appears—or is said to appear—as a serpent falls in love  with a mortal woman. In Lamia, a being with supernatural powers who has  been a woman but whom we first see in the form of a serpent falls in love  with a mortal man [Lycius].”52 Moreover, the two immortals create, for their   45. I thank Daniel Ogden for bringing this story to my attention. For an introduction to the story  of Melusine, see Sax (1998) 84–87 and 238–45.  46. Morris (2007) 1.  47. Nichols (1996) 140 and 143. Nichols also notes the potential influence of Apuleius’ De Deo  Socratis, with its discussion of demons, but does not specifically mention Apuleius’ Metamorphoses  (141).  48. Nichols (1996) 137.  49. For a study of Melusine in myth and literature, see Alban (2003), which traces A. S. Byatt’s  use of Melusine back through medieval legend and ancient myth, and includes discussion of the  Greek Lamia as well as Near Eastern and Egyptian goddesses such as Ishtar and Isis.  50. Including his “Ode to Psyche,” written earlier that same year. Gross (1990) 253 notes that  Keats would have been drawing on William Adlington’s sixteenth-century translation of Apuleius.  51.

For example, Apuleius describes the floor of Cupid’s palace thus: “blessed and  thrice blessed were they which might go upon such a pavement of gems and  ornaments,” while the marble floor of Lamia’s palace is so rich that “none but  feet divine / Could e’er have touched there” (1.385–86).53 Music from invis- ible musicians fills both palaces. Like Psyche, Lycius begs his supernatural  lover for permission to do something that the lover knows will threaten their  relationship: where Cupid warns Psyche against seeing her sisters, Lamia  warns Lycius not to invite Apollonius to their wedding. Both Cupid and La- mia consent against their better judgment. When Apollonius reveals Lamia  to be a Serpent, she vanishes into thin air, much as Cupid disappears after  Psyche’s disobedient act. Keats, though, does Apuleius one better: whereas  Psyche merely attempts suicide after Cupid deserts her, Lycius actually dies  when Lamia leaves him.54 Gross explains, “[Keats’s] deliberate denial of the  possibility of lasting happiness in a mortal’s love for an immortal, in contrast  to the immortal bliss granted to Cupid and Psyche, reinforces the modern  consensus that Keats is being very realistic in his exploration of illusion and  reality in Lamia.”55 In contrast, the old woman telling the Cupid and Psyche  tale to Charite must give her a story with a happy ending to distract her from  her dire situation, and give her the illusion that all may turn out well.  In short, if Keats saw a specific relationship between Apuleius’ Cupid and the  Lamia legend, we ought to at least consider the possibility that Apuleius, too,  might have had that relationship in mind. The striking similarities between the  Lamia tale connected to Apollonius of Tyana and the details of the Cupid and  Psyche story certainly suggest a connection. Various bits of Lamia lore, clearly  familiar to Apuleius, had already been circulating (Dio’s Oration being one  example) and such a connection would greatly help explain Psyche’s reaction to  her sister’s story—a reaction which otherwise remains a highly problematic sec- tion of the narrative. If we picture Psyche’s unseen husband as a male equivalent  to the Lamia, as a shape-shifting or anguipedal creature who seduces humans  only to feed on their flesh, Psyche’s reaction makes a great deal more sense.
