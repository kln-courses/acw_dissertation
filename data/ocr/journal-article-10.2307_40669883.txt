The stars will not come down to rebuke me even though I believe and teach that they are illuminated holes in a metal dome fifty miles above my head. I will have to continue in error until my mind recognizes some circumstance inconsistent with the false notion. Why isn't Mother Nature more sensitive to human mistakes ? Wouldn't it be grand if she rang a warning bell every time man came to a wrong conclusion ? Or would it ? I fear our heads would be filled with such an incessant din that useful thought would be impossible. Man needs quiet contemplation to build out of ob- servational data an adequate conception of the universe about him. After all it is surely well that Nature is not disturbed by hu- man error or ignorance. No matter whether my understanding of gravitation is right, wrong, or zero, I am drawn toward the earth in an invariable manner, which on the whole is quite satis- factory. True, I should like to suspend gravitation for a second or two when my favorite pole vaulter is on the way up, but I doubt whether I am wise enough to be entrusted with even this momentary responsibility. Nature is really patient and sympathetic. Although she may not go out of her way to ring a warning bell when man makes an error in interpretation, she does provide a generous lot of infallible textbooks. We ourselves must turn the pages and work out the meaning. Although the stars do not disclose their true * Alexander F.

The spectacle of the starlit sky is magnificent ; but far more wonderful are the facts about the stars revealed to the eye of the mind through long centuries of patient study. The contrast be- tween the apparent and the real is perhaps the greatest in all human experience. The stars are not anthropomorphic ; to him who knows something of their distance, size, and constitution they speak in strange phrases. The contemplation of man's re- lation to the stars is at once bewildering and inspiring. Stars are those units of the universe which most nearly cor- respond to the active adult citizens of a country. To understand nations and political parties we must know people. In the same way, to understand nebulae, clusters, and galaxies, we must know stars. My talk will consist chiefly of an attempt to give partial an- swers to three questions : 1. What is a star? What is it made of? Is it solid, liquid, or gaseous ? 2. What can it do? 3. What is its place in the universe ? That is, what, if any, are its relationships to other objects? WHAT IS A STAR? Everybody knows something about the sun. Its great bril- liance, its angular diameter of about half a degree, and the warmth produced by its rays are apparent to the unaided senses. Hence the best single categorical answer to the question, "Just what is a star?" is probably, "A distant sun." This is no overdrawn analogy, but rather an understatement. Swinging across the blue sky, our sun seems to us great, glorious, and overpowering. We cannot even look directly at him. But from a cosmic viewpoint he is much less impressive ; he is in fact not a giant star but a dwarf. Most of the naked-eye stars are larger, brighter, and hotter than the sun. A star, although composed of the same chemical elements as the earth, is so hot that it is gaseous. Under the gravitational action of all its parts it naturally assumes a spherical form. Thus</page><page sequence="3">ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC 7 2l star may be likened to a huge spherical balloon, filled with superheated gas. Like a balloon, a star has an opaque optical cover, called the photosphere, which gives it a sharp boundary and prevents us from seeing inside. Our direct observational knowledge of stars is therefore confined to the outermost layers. Because a star is very large, these outer layers are far from its center and the pull of gravity is relatively weak. Moreover the temperature is high. The density, therefore, is less than that of the air at the surface of the earth. The gas at the center, on the other hand, is highly condensed. In a typical dwarf star such as the sun the average density is a little greater than that of water. In a red giant such as a long-period variable the average density may be less than one-hundredth that of the air in this room. One of these variables may be described as a giant soap bubble filled with a red-hot vacuum, the whole thing pulsating slowly. A star generates and sends out so much energy that we might well call it an incandescent powerhouse. The equivalent horse- power radiated is subject to reasonably accurate calculation through the laws of physics. The amount staggers the imagi- nation. For certain stars it is 5 followed by 26 ciphers ! For the sun, divide by a thousand, or knock off three ciphers. How the star manages to generate this much energy will be discussed later. One of the most curious answers to the question, "What is a star?" is, "A mathematical point." How can a huge spherical balloon, or a fiery soap bubble, or an incandescent powerhouse be a mathematical point ? You must consider this paradox care- fully if you are to understand the problems of stellar astronomy. Let us start with the sun, our best-known example of a star. What would you have to do to the sun to transform it to a lumi- nous point? It is very simple - just move away from it. Dis- heartened perhaps by your seeming unfriendliness, the sun will suffer an optical collapse. When you have gone 100 million miles it will look only one-half as big as usual ; its diameter would be 15' instead of 30'. At a billion miles the diameter would be 3' ; the sun would then present a barely perceptible disk to the most acute eye, although it would still look large through a tele- scope if you had one along. At 200 billion miles its diameter would be only 1" ; at 1 trillion miles 0'.'2 ; and at 25 trillion miles</page><page sequence="4">8 PUBLICATIONS OF THE (approximately the distance of the nearest star) less than O'.'Ol. This last angle is far too small for the best eye to distinguish even with the best telescope. This does not mean that the sun would become invisible, but that for all practical purposes it would be a mathematical point of light. This is very nearly true of all the fixed stars as seen from the earth. No telescope yet made or of which we can now conceive will ever show to direct observation the size or shape of any fixed star. Telescopic observation will, of course, set an upper limit to the longest dimension, but that limit is well above the actual size. Our knowledge of the sizes of stars comes from physical theory plus a few observational tricks, such as a special use of interference fringes, or spectro- scopic analysis of rotating stars. Aside from these technical tricks, none of which is of very general application, we cannot distinguish one part of a star from another. This digression on stars as mathematical points will recall some of the inherent difficulties in determining the true nature of stars. It is as if you had to determine the structure and prop- erties of a laboratory source of light, say an electric arc, by study- ing the light transmitted through a small hole covered with ground glass which thoroughly mixes the light from various por- tions of the arc. The astronomer's way of saying it is that he must work with the integrated light of the stellar disk. Most of our knowledge of stars would indeed have been impossible ex- cept for the marvelous power of the spectroscope, combined with the ability of the photographic plate to preserve a reliable de- tailed record. WHAT CAN A STAR DO ? The most important thing a star does is to radiate heat and light. A star's radiation is pretty big business. At least we would think so if we had to pay for it, because at the usual rates for electrical energy, the earth would owe the sun one billion dollars every second. Now the sun radiates not only to the earth - a tiny speck as seen from the sun - but equally in all directions ; to pay for the total energy sent out multiply by 2,200,000,000. This for the sun ; for giant stars multiply again by 1,000. No ordinary chemical or gravitational process can provide</page><page sequence="5">ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC 9 so much energy year after year for stellar lifetimes reckoned in hundreds of millions of centuries. That is why physicists turn to atom building as the method of heat generation in the stellar powerhouses. If, for example, four hydrogen atoms can be in- duced to combine to form one helium atom, a lot of potential energy (mass) will be made available as radiant energy. This act of combining may occur in the terrifically hot gas inside a star. A plausible series of atomic transformations, known as the carbon cycle, has been put forward by the physicist Bethe as the probable process. Thus we believe that one of the things a star can do is to make helium out of hydrogen. The intricate structure of stellar radiation is even more won- derful than the tremendous amount of energy involved. This structure in a beam of starlight fortunately is not lost or even blurred during the long voyage through the abysmal depths of interstellar space. It conveys detailed messages from the stars concerning their composition and motions. These messages, re- vealed only by the spectroscope, are in a code not too difficult to decipher. Many of those received have already been trans- lated ; a few remain enigmatic. A man must eat and breathe but he may or may not play golf. A star, to be worthy of the name, must radiate light, but other possible activities are - shall we say ? - optional. It may, for ex- ample, rotate on its axis. We know only a little about this rela- tively simple activity which in certain stars may lead to interesting results. The sun rotates slowly on its axis, not as a solid sphere but in a rather curious fashion such that the time of rotation decreases from the equator toward the poles. At the equator the time of rotation is about 25 days; at the 45° zones, 27 days. The solar rotation has a strong effect on sunspots ; these are oriented in a special way in zones parallel to the equator. This is true also of certain types of solar prominences. The detailed physical ex- planation of these facts has not yet been worked out. In the spectra of certain stars, the lines are widened and blurred, an effect believed to indicate a rotation more rapid than that of the sun. Confirmation can be obtained in a few eclipsing binaries in which a relatively dark companion moves across in</page><page sequence="6">10 PUBLICATIONS OF THE front of the bright star covering first one side and then the other. The well-known variable star Algol is such a binary. Another thing that certain stars can do is to pulsate like an inflated toy balloon into which an additional puff of air is intro- duced and withdrawn at regular intervals. This is something of a stunt for a star but it can be managed, apparently without out- side help. The exertion, however, interferes with the star's out- put of light and heat, which varies rhythmically in time with the pulsations. Two periods are preferred - one of about half a day (RR Lyrae variables, sometimes called cluster variables because many have been discovered in globular clusters) ; the other of five or six days (Cepheid variables). Calculations by Sir Arthur Eddington make it probable that the periods coincide with the natural resonance periods of free vibration. Why the periods are so closely limited to two values is not known. The varia- tions of the long-period variables with periods about 300 days may be associated with slower pulsations in larger, more tenu- ous stars. The recurring changes of brightness of some of these red variables are astonishingly large. One well-known star, 1 Cygni, period 406 days, is several thousand times as bright at maximum as at minimum. It would be bad if our sun should start this kind of performance, but there is no danger, for it is not at all of the stellar type subject to such exhibitions. Varia- bility is a disease of bloated stars ; our sun is a shrunken dwarf. Its natural period of volume-pulsation would be only about two hours. The cause of the 11 -year sunspot cycle we do not know. Like any other mass of gas, a star has a tendency to expand until all available space is filled. This tendency is resisted, and in the normal star overcome, by the mutual gravitational attraction of all the particles. Thus most stars are stabilized, their outer portions being nearly quiescent as is the atmosphere of the earth which is stabilized in the same way. In a few queer stars, however, the outer strata seem partly out of control, for some of their atoms are observed to move rap- idly outward. These stars with expanding atmospheres present important physical problems. We should much like to know what forces drive the atoms outward in defiance of gravitation. The velocities may be very high ; in some stars they are hundreds of</page><page sequence="7">ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC 11 miles per second - yes per second, not per hour or per minute. These velocities may be sustained for long periods. Occasionally the action is explosive, the whole outer atmosphere being blown away. At the time this happens the star brightens up so much that when its enhanced beams reach the earth, astronomers call it a nova or new star. Thus the most spectacular thing a star can do is to explode. The foregoing paragraphs treat the stars from the physical standpoint. Astrophysics is that branch of modern astronomy which considers the stars not as hard, cold points of light ideal for exact measurement of position on the celestial sphere, but as they really are - immense globes of incandescent gas continually doing interesting things. a star's place in the universe In the political economy of the universe, stars are the adult voting citizens; planets (like the earth) are children; satellites (like the moon) are dogs and cats, the children's little playmates ; star clusters are cities or states ; galaxies are nations. This cos- mic organization was not obvious but like other secrets of the stars had to be worked out step by step as facts accumulated. From one point of view the stars are pretty lonesome crea- tures. If the sun should wave to its nearest stellar neighbor, the signal, traveling 186,000 miles per second, would not be received for four years, and the answering signal would take another four, years to get back. If communication were by shouting, the an- swer would come back in about 8,000,000 years. (Notice that this illustration is hypothetical. You can't shout through a vacuum.) The relative spacing of the stars is something like that of raindrops four miles apart. In the observable volume of astronomical space about one part in 1029 is occupied by stars. Does this isolation mean that each star is a perfectly free agent, behaving just as it would if no other stars existed? This is certainly not true as far as motion is concerned. The most obvious instance of controlled motion is in double stars, the sib- lings of celestial society. If close together, the stars may whirl each other about at a giddy pace, completing a revolution in a few hours ; if farther apart, they move more leisurely, their or-</page><page sequence="8">12 PUBLICATIONS OF THE bital periods being measured in years or even hundreds of years. Another kind of gravitational control affects the motions of stars, namely that of the galaxy acting as a whole. This causes the stars to move in great galactic orbits, about a common center. Although the motions are fast, one or two hundred miles per second, they are not easy to detect. The chief reason for this is that the sun, carrying the earth with it, travels right along with the near-by stars. Space affords no milestones for measuring absolute motion. Hence galactic orbits may be recognized only from a statistical study of the differences of motion of stars at various distances from the galactic center. Attention was called to the subject a few years ago by the important investigations of Oort and Lindblad, followed by many others. A few ifs re- main, but the idea of a grand galactic rotation has, on the whole, been so successful a working hypothesis that astronomers now treat it as an established fact. At the distance of the sun from the galactic center, several hundred million years would be re- quired for a complete revolution. Thus our Milky Way system, and probably the external gal- axies of which spiral nebulae are beautiful examples, are nearly stable dynamical units, having indefinitely long lifetimes. Within the galaxies the great globular star clusters like the well-known one in the constellation Hercules are well-organized subdivisions and will doubtless persist for a long time. Open clusters like the Hyades or the Pleiades are probably more transient. In addition to the systematic motions just described, stars have smaller erratic motions which may be in various directions. These individualistic or "random" motions are also of great in- terest because they depend upon the physical characteristics of the stars in a manner which baffles our comprehension. The situ- ation may be illustrated by an imaginary bird's-eye view of the streets of a busy city, which shows that on the average the brown autos move twice as fast as the green ones ; moreover the brown cars move predominantly north, the green ones about equally in all four directions. One feature of the analogous stellar motion we do partly understand. The so-called high-speed stars, which move predominantly in one direction, are actually those stars which have ¡ess than the average amount of forward motion cor-</page><page sequence="9">ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC 13 responding to the general galactic circulation and are thus being overtaken by the sun. These stars probably have more elongated orbits with less tangential motion and more radial motion than the average star. Some of the most obvious, the most interesting, and the most important relationships in the system of the stars lack any ade- quate explanation. This is largely because we are so ignorant con- cerning stellar history. Astrophysics has spent considerable time living down pretentious theories of stellar evolution which gave a plausible, even a spectacular, interpretation of selected facts, but which failed to meet the tests of increasing observational knowl- edge. A tenderly nursed hypothesis may wither when the watering pot of special pleading runs dry. Nevertheless the stars do form a system and they do have a history. We can hope to improve our knowledge only by extending observation and by exploiting prom- ising ideas. An erroneous idea may do more good than harm provided it does not interfere with impartial scientific judgment. Much recent research has been devoted to what may be called the morphology of the stars. This well-developed branch of as- tronomy is fundamental to a general understanding of the uni- verse. Of our present jumbled ideas of stellar evolution, however, the less said the better. According to their colors and other physical properties, the stars may be arranged in a well-defined temperature sequence. To account for the main features of the diverse array of stellar spectra, it is sufficient to assume uniform chemical composition of the stars with a range of surface temperatures from about 2,000° to 30,000° C. It is possible that the spectral peculiarities of certain objects may be due to unusual composition. Speaking broadly, however, astronomical bodies exhibit far less diversity in chemical composition than in temperature or density. This statement includes the earth, the sun, stars, interstellar matter, gaseous nebulae, star clusters, and spiral nebulae. In short, the earth is a good chemical sample of the whole universe. Our discussion thus far has been concerned wholly with stars, the relationship of one star to another, or of one star to a system of stars. In addition to these resplendent and aristocratic stellar citizens, our galaxy contains a lot of unorganized, underprivi-</page><page sequence="10">14 PUBLICATIONS OF THE leged matter thinly distributed between the stars in an abysmal nondescript substratum. Starlight which goes slumming in this vast galactic under- world encounters both dirt and fumes. The great dark markings shown so conspicuously by photographs of the Milky Way are the silhouettes of clouds of coarse dust which block off the stellar background. More finely divided dust is semitransparent but causes a reddening of starlight which passes through it, compa- rable to the reddening of the sun by a smoky atmosphere. The gases have a more delicate effect : they merely produce narrow dark lines in the stellar spectra. Like faint fingerprints, however, these lines reveal the chemical identity of the atoms of which the gas is composed. The constituents of interstellar gas most exten- sively studied are sodium and calcium. Traces of certain other elements and of a very few compounds, notably cyanogen, have been detected. Masses of gas in the vicinity of white-hot stars may fluoresce under the action of ultraviolet light from the stars. Such glowing clouds are called nebulae. In the small ring or disk-shaped "planetary" nebulae, the glowing gas was probably expelled from the central star thousands of years ago, but there is no evidence of expulsion in the larger irregular nebulae like the Orion or the Trifid nebula. The stars and the interstellar matter have one thing in com- mon - galactic rotation. Extensive spectroscopic measurements by Plaskett and others have shown that the gas between the stars is probably revolving about the galactic center in much the same way as the stars themselves. Our knowledge of stars as citizens of the universe, while ex- tensive and steadily increasing, is still very incomplete. Perhaps it is fair to say that we feel well acquainted with many typical individuals ; we know a great deal about their chemical compo- sition, their structure, and their daily habits. We know some- thing about the groups and organizations to which they belong. And ingenious guesses have been made concerning their origin and life history.
