<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEWS AND NOTES A Buddhist Monk's View of Theological Encounter III Gudo Wafu Nishijima The Eastern Institute, Tokyo, Japan When I read Theological Encounter III in Volume 8 of Buddhist-Christian Studies (1988), I found the articles of great interest. This is because these arti- cles touch on many philosophical problems which embrace the fundamental problems of Buddhism. I would like to take this opportunity to express my honest opinion on the ideas presented by the contributors and the similarities and differences with my own thinking. First I would like to give my views on the use of the words Ultimate Reality. On first encountering the phrase, I felt something a little odd. This is because, to me, reality is something which always exists here and now. So I wonder whether it actually makes sense to add the adjective ultimate to the word real- ity. Reality always exists at this place and at the moment of the present. In this sense we can say that reality is always ultimate and, at the same time, instanta- neous. This is at the root of my reservations over using the adjective ultimate when describing reality. ON PROFESSOR COBB'S ESSAY In his essay, ProfessorJohn Cobb seems in part to be attempting to ascertain to what extent God and the Buddhist Reality are the same. He seems to conclude that God and Ultimate Reality are somewhat different. This conclusion makes me a little sad. I still hope that if we are able to confirm the theme that God is Reality and Reality is God, then the distance separating Christianity and Bud- dhism will have been made a little smaller, and that there will then be the hope of finding the ultimate philosophical system which includes not only Christian- ity and Buddhism, but almost all other religions, too. At the same time, however, I find the features of experience which Professor Cobb uses to explain the Reality of God very useful in thinking about the nature of the Buddhist Reality as well. I am going to use the same features to look at what Buddhist Reality is, and in the process, clarify the similarities and differences between God and the Buddhist Reality. I will use these features: Buddhist-Christian Studies 11 (1991). ? by University of Hawaii Press.

Truth When I consider whether we can say that Reality is Truth, I find both the answer "yes" and the answer "no" equally true. In Buddhist belief, Reality or Dharma (Ho in Japanese) includes all the things and phenomena of the world. Thus we can say that reality is all and that nothing in the Universe exists outside of reality. It is possible, then, to say that Reality is Truth simply because there is no one who can deny that insistence. But at the same time we can say that Real- ity is not Truth because we have no objective criteria available which allow us to substantiate our denial. This is why I say that Reality is Truth and, at the same time, that Reality is not Truth. But we can take another attitude to the problem; we can believe that Reality is Truth. We have no way to certify that Reality is Truth, and so our belief is a kind of dogma. And I think that every religion contains dogmatic belief. Bud- dhists believe that Reality is Truth. Preference for this dogma over others is a characteristic of Buddhists. Righteousness Righteousness in Buddhism is related to how Buddhists view the concept of sin. In Buddhism, we believe in moral behavior. That is, our actions themselves should be right. If we act rightly, or righteously, then we can lead happy lives. If we act wrongly, then we will be unhappy. Many people think that Buddhism has no moral perspective, but this is not true. In Buddhism, we are very much concerned with right action. The relationship between right action and reality is complex, because we cannot in fact define exactly what a right action is for every situation in reality. That which is right in one situation may be wrong in another. Reality teaches us what is right and what is wrong. But Buddhists believe that reality is the present moment here and now. Even if we do wrong, there is no way that we can go back to the past to correct our wrong action. In that way the Buddhist attitude seems a little laissez-faire. We are not concerned with our wrong action in the past, but with right action here and now. And from that perspective, Buddhism is not interested in sins committed, but in righteous action. And righteous action depends on the situation here and now. It is always changing as reality presents itself in the present moment. Freedom In Buddhism, the concept of freedom is based upon the fundamental construc- tion of reality. Reality is always existence at the present moment. And the present moment is a period of time which is infinitely short in duration. In this 274</page><page sequence="3">NEWS AND NOTES situation, human freedom can be likened to a pearl balanced on the edge of a razor blade. It has equal probabilities of falling to the left or to the right. In this way, human beings have freedom even though they are caught in the net of cause and effect. Directedness Professor Cobb concludes "Rather than try to control all that happens within me, I try to let that wisdom work within me. This is, quite directly, a matter of trust. What I trust I call God." Directedness in Buddhism is somewhat different from the concept presented here by Professor Cobb. In Buddhism, reality is defined as the mutual relation- ship between me and the Universe. That is the meeting between me and the external world in the present moment. We are part of the Universe and so we are directed by the Universe; external events determine what we do, and we fol- low the circumstances. But at the same time, we have a degree of freedom as human beings, and therefore we can change the external world to an extent; we can influence events to a degree. So in reality we influence the course of events to a degree and we follow where the world leads to a degree. We call this situa- tion reality. So we can say that reality is the state in which we are directing and at the same time, are directed. Immanence and Transcendence Referring to immanence, Professor Cobb says: "God's truth is the right coordi- nation of all truths-not something apart from them. Our truths have their place in God, contributing distortedandfragmentary truths in such a way that along with all the other distorted andfragmentary truths, they are formed into unsurpassable Truth. That Truth is more than all the truths that contribute to it, but it is not another truth alongside them" (p. 60). In Buddhism, Reality is always immanent, because we live in Reality. If we substitute perspective for the word "truth," and if we substitute Reality for God, the expression of Immanence above also fits Buddhism. Professor Cobb says: "Truth belongs to God and not to creatures either. Divine truth and divine righteousness transcend and judge human error and sin" (p. 60). In the sense of something separate from what we experience, Buddhists do not believe that reality is transcendent. Buddhists do not believe in a reality which is separate from the present and inaccessible. But in the sense that reality cannot be described adequately with words, we say that reality transcends our thoughts and perceptions of it. It is not accessible in its completeness to either our intellect or our sense perception. But we live in reality. And so we experi- ence reality at every moment with our whole body and mind. In this sense, real- ity is transcendent over our thoughts and perceptions of it. 275</page><page sequence="4">NEWS AND NOTES At the same time, the following words of the Professor's describe the rela- tionship between reality and ourselves very well: "The doctrine of dependent origination enables us to see that we may equally well, and equally inade- quately, view a moment of human experience as the objective (i.e., transcen- dent) world's act of originating the experience or as the experience appropriat- ing the objective (transcendent) world. In other words, all that is transcendent is immanent, and all that is immanent is transcendent. The ordinary distinc- tion of transcendence and immanence depends on a notion of the self-con- tainedself with boundaries." He goes on to say that "Such a self does not exist. " But in the sense that real- ity is immanent and transcendent, there is no need to concern ourselves with whether there truly is a self or is not a self; reality includes something we call self. We believe primarily in the existence of reality as the meeting of the self and the external world, both immanent and transcendent. Is Reality Personal? In Buddhism, Reality is not personal. But at the same time there are also anthropomorphic images of reality even in Buddhism. Examples include Tatha- gata Vairocana, a symbol of the sun, which illuminates the whole world. Vairo- cana is thus used as a personification of the whole of reality, the whole Uni- verse. God andReality I have considered the nature of reality in Buddhism using Professor Cobb's fea- tures of experience. In this I have said very little about the Christian perspec- tive. This is because I have very little knowledge of Christianity and Christian theology. I feel it is important not to discuss ideas about which one knows very little. My hope is to express Buddhist philosophy based on Master Dogen's thought. In this way, readers who are Christians can easily compare their beliefs with Buddhist beliefs. ON PROFESSOR ABE'S ESSAY When I read Professor Abe's essay I am reminded that he was a student of Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, a professor at Kyoto University who was diligent in prac- ticing Zazen as a follower of Rinzai Sect theory. He taught "Zen" with great conviction, but I am left wondering whether his religion of Zen is the same as Buddhism or not. Professor Abe says "Among religions of humankind, there are religions which are not based on faith but instead on enlightenment or awakening. Con- spicuous examples of this type of religion are the originalform of Buddhism and Zen" (p. 65). It may well be true that the Zen religion is a religion based 276</page><page sequence="5">NEWS AND NOTES not on faith but instead on enlightenment or awakening. But I have considera- ble doubt as to whether the original form of Buddhism included this funda- mental idea. I think that every religion has had some kind of faith as its base; even the original form of Buddhism is based on Gautama Buddha's experienc- ing that the whole earth and all sentient beings on it are real, or, in other words, that reality is splendid and exists here and now. And Gautama Buddha urged his followers to experience the same state by relying on the practice of Zazen. And his many disciples did have the same experience that he had. But one problem is how to recognize that my experience is in fact the same as his experience; of course we can have our own confidence that the experience is common, but that confidence is in fact a kind of faith. I do not think that we have any method by which we can attest to the fact that our experiences in Zazen are the same, by which we can believe that it is a shared experience. So, although I feel quite sure that the original form of Buddhism was based on a kind of faith, I do not know what the actual situation may be in the Zen reli- gion. Although I practice Zazen every day, this practice is the practice of Bud- dhism; it is not related to the Zen religion. The next point I would like to take up is Professor Abe's comments about scientism, Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, and the rest: "Conspicuous examples of such religion-negating ideologies are scientism, traditional Freudian psycho- analysis, Marxism, and nihilism in Nietzsche's sense. Although from different angles, all of these prevailing systems of thought deny in principle the validity of religion itself as not serving any useful purpose for people." I have very strong reservations about this idea. I usually divide religions into three groups: spiritual religions, materialistic religions, and realistic religions. I am sure that many scholars will feel that this categorization is naive and somewhat simplis- tic. But I think that in the Western tradition, all religions have to be spiritual disciplines, and so it makes no sense to talk about materialistic religions or real- istic religions. But my definition of religion is different from the normally accepted one. I believe that religion is thought and behavior arising from that thought which is based on some kind of faith. And we can infer that there are three kinds of faith: faith in spirit, faith in matter, and faith in reality. So from my perspective it is not so peculiar to anticipate the existence of three kinds of religion: religions of the spirit, religions of matter, and religions of reality. In this categorization of mine, Buddhism is a religion of reality. From this view, I think that scientific knowledge is extremely useful in explaining the Buddhist principle of cause and effect. Overall, we can say that science is research into the rule of cause and effect, which pervades the whole Universe. So the more developed scientific knowledge becomes, the more clearly certified is the truth of the Buddhist principle of cause and effect. The development of science has added immeasurably to the clarification of Buddhist theory. For example, I found it difficult to understand the real meaning of alaya-vijiana for many years. But on finding out about the Freudian concept of the uncon- scious, I could clearly recognize the true meaning of laya-vifidna. Copernicus, 277</page><page sequence="6">NEWS AND NOTES Newton, Darwin, and other scientists clearly taught us that the Universe is gov- erned by the rule of cause and effect, and in this way they affirmed the Bud- dhist principle of cause and effect very objectively. I think that even Nietzsche's philosophy is useful in understanding Buddhism. This is because Nietzsche clearly recognized both the value and limitations of idealistic philosophy or subjectivism, and the value and limits of materialistic philosophy or objectiv- ism. He knew clearly the unrealistic and one-sided character of these two phi- losophies, and was searching for something new. I think that he was looking for a new philosophy which could be relied upon in the age following the culmina- tion of materialism in the nineteenth century. Of course, we can say that scientism is a kind of religion based only on mat- ter. And from this point of view, I agree with Professor Abe's criticism of scien- tism as a form of materialistic religion. But I do not agree with his criticism of Freud and Nietzsche, and if he is by implication criticizing science itself, too, I must protest! In Professor Abe's essay we can find two rather strange concepts: that of the "positionless position," and that of the "non-perspective perspective" (p. 71). On these two points Professor Cobb has proclaimed his doubts clearly: "I am profoundly sceptical that there is a positionless position. I don't believe that it is attained any more through sunyata than through what Christians call revela- tion. In a sense, I understand the claim, but when I talk to Professor Abe or to otherBudddhists, I don't encounter apositionlessposition " (pp. 75, 76). Solely from my point of view as a Buddhist, I agree completely with Professor Cobb's pronouncement. I think that the concept of a positionless position stands in danger of violating Aristotelian logic, especially the principle of the excluded middle. In the history of Western thought we can find something called Hegelian dialectic. But even dialectical method does not break the rules of Aristotelian logic. Without our base in Aristotelian logic, we cannot even assert the validity of dialectical method, which itself is a trial attempt in tran- scending Aristotelian logic. If we negate Aristotelian logic, it becomes impossi- ble for us to talk about transcending it. So even in the twentieth century, I think it somewhat ill-advised to use concepts such as "positionless position" amd "perspectiveless perspective." In the discussion following Professor Abe's response, Professor Cobb says: "The claim to a positionless position, even as a possibility or goal, seems to reflect a particular position-namely one which is not as informed by the his- torical conditionedness that we Westerners have accentuated with our horizons of sensitivity" (p. 76). And even I, an Easterner, affirm this statement abso- lutely. Not only to Westerners, but to Easterners, too, this assertion is true. So I feel that there is absolutely no need for Professor Cobb to say as he does, "I hope that this does not soundlike Western arrogance" (p. 76). And the rebuttal that Professor Cobb makes in the following excerpt from the discussion also contains a general truth: "In the philosophical tradition in the West, I think that many philosophers are also seeking a positionless posi- 278</page><page sequence="7">NEWS AND NOTES tion. Ijust don't believe it-perhaps because of my Christian belief in original sin" (p. 76). If I change the word "Christian" into "Buddhist," and the word "original sin" into "reality," this exactly expresses the Buddhist point of view as well. Again, I think it is true that "Nietzche is a visionary thinker. He does not prove his case by some kind of utterly convincing, rational argument. I don't think he has put aside once andfor all whether the Truth might be something more than the particular perspective or the radical idea ofa perspectiveless per- spective" (p. 76). I also agree with Professor Cobb when he says: "For me the sense of being known is a very importantpart of who Iam. It may be a complete illusion. How can I everprove that it is true? But, the piety in which I have been formed con- tains the sense that there are features of myself that are real that I do not know. My not knowing them doesn't mean that they don't exist. No one else knows them either. They are not apart ofanyone 'sperspective. Yet, Ifeel that they are real. To me, that's religiously important" (p. 76, 77). Although this quotation is not short, when I read the lines, I found myself saying "Yes, Yes, and Yes again." How can it be that a Christian idea and a Buddhist idea are actually so close to each other? Professor Cobb goes on to say: "But there's an exceedingly real sense in which I am in God; and being in God, I am included in ways that I myself can- not even begin to understand" (p. 77). If I change "God" into "Reality" the sentence becomes an expression of pure Buddhism: "But there's an exceedingly real sense in which I am in Real- ity; and being in Reality, Iam included in ways that I myself cannot even begin to understand." In Professor Mitchell's contribution to the discussion I found a very interest- ing idea: "He (Professor Cobb) mentions Eckhart. I wouldlike to approach this topic by using the three stages of experience in Buddhist life mentioned by Pro- fessor Ray. In the first stage, there is a direct understanding ofBuddha in a very straightforward way. In the second stage there is a move to Emptiness. Then in the third stage, one finds what Ray referred to as the experience of the per- fectedBuddha, or the mature form ofBuddha" (p. 81). The reason for my interest in the interpretation of these stages from Tibetan Buddhism is that they are very similar to the process of logic used by Master Dogen, a process which I usually refer to as the "Four Philosophies" or "Three Philosophies and One Reality. " In the Shobogenzo, written by Master Dogen, we can find a chapter called "Genjo Koan," which translates as "The Realized Law of the Universe."2 When all things and phenomena exist as Buddhist teachings, then there are delusion and realization, practice and experience, life and death, Buddhas and ordinary people. When millions of things and phenomena are all separate from ourselves, there are no delusion and no enlighten- 279</page><page sequence="8">NEWS AND NOTES ment, no Buddhas and no ordinary people, no life and no death. Bud- dhism is originally transcendent over abundance and scarcity, and so [in reality] there is life and death, there is delusion and realization, there are people and buddhas. Though all this may be true, flowers fall even if we love them, and weeds grow even if we hate them, and that is all. In this quotation, "When all things andphenomena exist as Buddhist teach- ings" suggests an idealistic philosophy in which the whole of existence is looked at from the basis of Buddhist ideals. So at this "first stage," in Master D6gen's thought, too, there is a "direct understanding of Buddha in a very straight- forward way " (p. 81). Professor Mitchell's expression has for me a striking simi- larity to the first stage in Master Dogen's system of logic as he outlines it in the Gen/o Koan-The Realized Rule of the Universe. The next part of the quotation says "When millions of things andphenom- ena are all separate from ourselves. .. ." This suggests an objectivistic philo- sophical point of view. At this point, I am not convinced of the relation between objective philosophy and "the move toward Emptiness" of Professor Mitchell's second stage. But here I think it is important to look more closely at the meaning of Emptiness. We can take it that Emptiness is a translation of the Sanskrit word "sunyata." Professor Abe has said, "the ultimate reality for the Buddhist is Sunyata" (p. 74). And so I feel that it is very important to discuss the real meaning of sunyata, and I would like to take up that theme. When we say that "reality is sunyata," we need to be clear on whether the word sunyata is functioning as a noun or as an adjective. If sunyata is function- ing as a noun, then "reality is sunyata" means that reality is emptiness or noth- ingness. And this statement suggests a denial of existent reality. If this is the case, then Buddhism is in danger of falling into the pit of nihilism. But if we consider the word sufnyata in its function as an adjective, then "reality is sun- yata" is understood to mean "reality is as if it were nothing" or "reality is noth- ing-like." Because I strongly believe that Buddhist philosophy is realistic, and can never be nihilistic, I believe the latter interpretation. It makes sense to me that way. If we then accept this meaning of sunyata, Professor Mitchell's statement "In the secondstage there is a move to Emptiness" can be understood to mean that there is a move to a point of view in which people perceive the external world objectively or selflessly. In this case, the second stage in Tibetan Buddhist phi- losophy becomes the same as the second phase in Master Dogen's thought. If this is then the case, Professor Mitchell's expression "Then in the third stage one finds what Ray referred to as the experience of the perfected Buddha or the mature form of Buddha" (p. 81) corresponds to two phases in Master Dogen's philosophy; Master Dogen talks about the philosophy of reality and reality itself-outside of the intellectual area. Of course it is presumptuous of me to conclude directly that "the experience of the perfected Buddha, or the mature form of Buddha" is the direct equivalent of Master Dogen's categories 280</page><page sequence="9">NEWS AND NOTES of the philosophy of reality and reality itself, but the reason that I am bold enough to suggest it is that I have for some time anticipated, and continue to hope, that the Buddhism of India, Tibet, China, and Japan can be synthesized into one grand system relying on the theory of Three Philosophies and One Reality. At the end of the discussion I find a very encouraging remark by Professor Miyuki. He says "In my understanding, Ultimate Reality in Buddhism is dharma. Usually Buddhism teaches that the dharma is pratitya-samutpada. Some people consider pratitya-samutpada as an obstruction. I don't agree with that understanding. Dharma refers to concrete reality. If dharma manifests in me, what will it be like? Awakening consciousness might bring me more suffer- ing in the form of a conscience, love for those suffering, and so forth. My stu- dents always say to me that becoming awakened creates more problems" (p. 82). I think that this statement hits the target of Buddhism. I believe that Mas- ter Dogen's thought is very realistic in the way that Professor Miyuki's com- ments are. I have the greatest hope that I can introduce Master Dogen's thought to other people in other countries. And I feel fortunate to have found a gateway through which to do this-the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies (SBCS). I feel much gratitude to those people who put me in touch with the SBCS. Now, although I want to contribute further to the views expressed in Theo- logical Encounter III, there are two reasons why I should stop here. One is that my knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism is quite poor, and the other is that this article will become too long. I welcome the chance to contribute my views again when the opportunity arises.
