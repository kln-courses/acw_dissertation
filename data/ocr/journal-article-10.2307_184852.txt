<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Literati Revolt Against Science BY MORRIS GORAN HE late Victorian novelist George Gissing wrote: "I hate and fear 'science' because of my con- viction that for a long time to come if not for- ever, it will be the remorseless enemy of mankind. I see it destroying all simplicity and gentleness of life, all beauty of the world; I see it restoring barbarism under the mask of civilization; I see it darkening men's minds and hardening their hearts; I see it bringing a time of vast conflicts which will pale into insigni- cance 'the thousand wars of old', and, as likely as not, will whelm all the laborious advances of mankind in blood-drenched chaos". The German philosopher Schelling protested against "that blind and thoughtless mode of investigating nature which has become generally established since the corruption of philosophy by Bacon and of physics by Boyle and Newton". The more publicised attack by religion has overshadowed such condemnations of science. When the clergy was more powerful its opinions were promulgated while those of the literati were used as supplements. Today, front-line positions are reversed: Several groups of the latter are entrenched in their opposition to science while the former serve as reserves. The rebellion of the literati against science is supported by four major brigades. They are i) those who revolt against the results of science or inferences from them; 2) the division irritated by the dispassionate, disinterested and objective method of view- 379</page><page sequence="2">380 Literati Revolt Against Science ing nature; 3) attackers who disparage science's absorption in small facts; and 4) the disappointed group who expected more achievement through science. Arguments often merge in the onslaught; one regiment occasionally uses the armaments of the others. But for the benefit of spectators, particular strategies of battle can be isolated. Among those who assault the results of science or inferences from them, there are two battalions. The layman is familiar with the group who direct their ammunition at technology and industrialism. Often, those who lose a position through a tech- nological advancement besides individuals nauseated with the ugly and unethical industrial order are fervent generals in this camp. They insist that the machine and hence science has mechanized, standardized and devaluated human life. Some would forsake the machine and return to the farm while others sympathize with political panaceas. Defenders of science have sent only one volley at these can- noneers. They proclaim that the social and economic system is responsible for the evil effects of technology, that science cannot be indicted for the manner in which it is being used. A second regiment in the first brigade are the old soldiers im- bued with a moral tinge and unable to absorb the grandiose inferences from scientific results. They cannot believe that man is merely the dominant animal on a speck of dirt insignificant among the numerous larger lumps of earth in the universe. They shudder at Bertrand Russell's pessimistic and dramatic picture: "... even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is the world which Science presents for our belief. Amid such a world, if anywhere, our ideals must henceforward find a home. That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental colloca- tions of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspira- tion, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system and that the</page><page sequence="3">M. Goran 381 whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins-. .." For this means, as Josiah Royce, the Harvard philosopher, has said, that our relations to the universe are "relations to an essentially foreign power which cares for our ideals as the stormy sea cares for the boat and as the bacteria care for the human organism upon which they prey". Friends of science accuse such critics of conservatism, of being more comfortable in the orderly systems developed by the scho- lastics and theologians where man has a self-complacency and an inflated ego. There a high human purpose can be abstracted from nature. A closely related regiment also aim scholarly denunciations at the lack of "humanism" in science. Their combat is often centered upon disparaging the method of science. Edwin Arthur Burtt in his Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science claims: "For modern metaphysics ... is in a large part a series of unsuccessful protests against the new view of the relation of man to nature. Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Fichte, Hegel, James, Berg- son-all are united in one earnest attempt, the attempt to rein- state man with his high spiritual claims in a place of importance in the cosmic scheme". The second brigade in the anti-science army is dissatisfied with the detached and impersonal elements of the scientific method. The artists and poets who are its main adherents desire more personal communion with nature through passion, emotion, feeling and sentiment. Walt Whitman has written: "When I heard the learn'd astronomer: When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me; When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide and measure them; When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much applause in the lecture room, How soon, unaccountably, I became tired and sick: Till rising and gliding out, I wandered off by myself, In the mystical moist night air, and from time to time, Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars."</page><page sequence="4">382 Literati Revolt Against Science Thoreau also emphasized that "nature must be viewed humanly to be viewed at all.... A fact must be the vehicle of some hu- manity in order to interest us.... A man has not seen a thing who has not felt it". Defenders assert that dispassion and disinterest in thinking and observing is responsible for the progress of many sciences. Alchemy, for example, had all the facts, hypotheses, experiments, apparatus and facilities for a more virile progress. And alchemy was stagnant not so much because it sought a now discarded goal but since it lacked the objectiveness of modern chemistry. Today, chemists do not give matter anthropomorphic char- acteristics. Some critics have reproached the relatively detached and isolated life of a scientist to argue against a "frigid" view of nature. Admiring non-scientists censure these tactics or cite as contradictory evidence the skilfully portrayed Hollywood exag- gerations and third-rate novels romanticising scientists. Many people forever have dispassion, disinterest, and avoid sentiment and emotion; their "animal nature" remains in a primitive condition to be exploited by profiteers and demagogues. In this respect scientists have been tolerant and understanding. Mad- ame Curie has advised young women: "It isn't necessary to lead such an anti-natural existence as mine. I have given a great deal of time to science because I wanted to, because I loved research.... What I want for women and young girls is a simple family life and some work that will interest them". The third division of literati-opponents man the light artillery. They mock those who make extended analyses of the segments of the left wing of the tze-tze fly or postulate upon the effect of sunshine on the number of seeds in a cucumber. Their bullets of satire amuse only themselves. Because a minute division of problems has been found the usual predecessor of complete solution; the small, the seemingly unimportant, the usually neglected must be considered in arriving at a well-rounded, whole idea. Thus science advances by dividing and conquering. The fourth squadron of attackers are keen strategists. Repre-</page><page sequence="5">M. Goran 383 sentative is Joseph Wood Krutch who has written: "We are disillusioned with the laboratory not because we have lost faith in the truth of its findings but because we have lost faith in the power of those findings to help us as generally as we had once hoped they might help". For others it is enough that science has "showered society with gifts" and that the scientific movement is an attempt to know nature solely through the powers of man. Numerous thinkers believe that future generations will rediscover a faith which Mr. Krutch has lost when the scientific attitudes are used in human relations. A platoon in the fourth brigade are chiefly educators. Edwin Grant Conklin, in his address as retiring president of the Ameri- can Association for the Advancement of Science, has described and answered this division: "Certain humanists have proposed that art, literature, history and political and moral philosophy should replace science in the educational program, since, as they assert, science neglects or destroys the real values of life, inas- much as it is said to be materialistic, non-ethical and lacking in high ideals. The president of the University of Chicago has recently called science a failure in the educational process and has urged a return to philosophy as the only sure road to sound discipline and true culture. .. The fact is well attested that science has given us grander and more inspiring concepts of the universe, of the order of nature, of the wonderful progress than were ever dreamed of in prescientific times. And as an educa- tional discipline there are no other studies that distinguish so sharply truth from error, evidence from opinion, reason from emotion; none that teach a greater reverence for truth nor inspire more laborious and persistent search for it". Recently published tirades against the new statistical methods, undertakings, and metaphysical speculation in physics label the modern concepts as religious and mystical. Such assaults are written not by foes but rather by friends afraid fresh facts, ideas and methods will mean the loss of science as they have known it in the past.</page><page sequence="6">384 Literati Revolt Against Science The literati friends of science, however, have given little assistance in active combat. Perhaps not much is needed. For compared to the attacks upon it, science has scarcely fired a defensive blow. Unperturbed, it has not ceased investigations; undaunted, it has refused to compromise. It answers with continued studies of nature. Chicago, III.</page></plain_text>
