<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS author has considered reference to the experimental studies of anthropoid behavior inappropriate to certain parts of the argument. From the standpoint of the reviewer, however, the major shortcoming of the treatment is the almost complete neglect of the ontogenetic evolutionary problem. This omission has led the author to avoid any reference to the processes by which the alleged developments of the race become effective in the individual. It might not have been without value, for example, to consider the evidence of modern ontogenetic studies in evaluating the phylogenetic theory of the behavior of chil- dren who walk on all fours. A detailed consideration of ontogeny might well have taken the present volume beyond the bounds set by the demands of a popular book. But at all times especial care must, it seems, be taken by the necessarily speculative student of phylogeny not to attribute to the essentially hypothetical racial environ- ment phenomena which may experimentally be shown to result from the inter- action of the environment and the developing organism in ontogeny. An excellent brief list of references is given at the close of the book. Brown University LEONARD CARMICHAEL Crime, Law, and Social Science. By JEROME MICHAEL and MORTIMER J. ADLER. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1933. Pp. xxix, 440. Here is a penetrating logical analysis of the relation of the social sciences to the practical problems of criminal justice, a revision of a survey originally made under the auspices of the School of Law of Columbia University for the Bureau of Social Hygiene. The authors, a legal scholar and a philosopher, have formulated the theoretical problems of the criminal law, examined and evaluated the research in this field, and summarized their conclusions and recommendations in the form of a plan for an institute of criminology and criminal justice. The analysis is thorough, the logic incisive and compelling, the conclusions positive and devastating. The argument running through the book, and oft repeated, is that in the present state of our knowledge no empirical science of criminology is possible, for such a science must depend on an empirical science of psychology and of sociology, which as such, are non-existent. Psychology, it seems, is suffering from dull logical tools and an immature epistemology. The failure of psychology to measure up to the exacting requirements of an empirical science as formulated and defined by the authors, is attributed to the lack of definition of subject matter and a misconception of the nature of the scientific method. Most of the material pre- sented by psychologists, it is claimed, is physiological rather than psychological. Furthermore, psychologists in their attempt to get away from a simple rational sci- ence which is no longer respectable psychology, have swung to the other extreme. With "an exclusive emphasis upon observation to the total neglect of the abstrac- tions of analysis" they have thrown the subject over to a "raw empiricism." Data yielded by psychological investigations of criminal behavior are both invalid and insignificant because the concepts prerequisite to observation are not clearly de- fined and the statistical descriptions utterly lack direction by theoretical analysis. These contributions therefore amount to little more than descriptive knowledge. An extensive, if not intensive, survey of the many research studies in the causation, treatment and prevention of crime lead the authors to the conclusion that the indispensable requirements of scientific procedure and method have not been met. They have failed to give us any knowledge whatever of the etiology of 372</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS crime, for they have failed to formulate the causal problem in terms of the de- pendent and independent variables; nor can they tell us whether criminals can or cannot be differentiated from non-criminals in terms of any set of factors. Though the authors distinguish between the subject matters of psychology and sociology they have a blanket condemnation of research studies contributed by both. Many of the studies cited are not, of course, the work of psychologists. On the constructive side they propose plans for an institute of criminology and criminal justice to attempt a solution of the two basic problems, the theoretical problem of etiology of criminal behavior and the practical problem of control. They recommend that the kind of research that is now being done be discontinued. It is significant that in the criminological division of the proposed institute, psychologists and sociologists would be replaced by logicians, mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists, the latter for their knowledge of the basic concepts of empirical science. It is the contention of the authors that the psychologists and the sociologists, lack- ing broad philosophical orientation, adequate knowledge of the methodology of science and the instruments of logic and mathematics, "have shown themselves utterly incompetent to construct a science of criminology." An exception is made of the special field of psychometry where an empirical science is developing. A weakness of the book is its self-conscious attempt on theoretical grounds to place all psychology outside of the closely circumscribed "empirical sciences" with- out adequate consideration of psychological contributions other than criminological. This thought-stimulating book is, however, a challenge to psychologists, sociologists, and other students of criminal behavior. To such it is a valuable and, in the re- viewer's opinion, a very important contribution. Dartmouth College EDWIN POWERS Revelation in Mormonism. By GEORGE B. ARBAUGH. Chicago, Univ. Chicago Press, 1932. Pp. x, 252. This book constitutes an excellent case-study of the development of a sacerdotal religion. Of all the major anthropomorphic religions Mormonism is unique in that it is more modern, that the sources are observable, and that more critical attention has been given to them. In spite of the fact that the background of Mormonism has been considerably blurred and distorted because of the bias of early proponents or opponents, the mass of evidence seems adequate to characterize it. The author presents a very intimate account of the various expediencies of the pro- moters of an organized cult. The first part deals with the craze of a century ago in rural New England for the discovery of buried treasure and lost manuscripts of ?ancient times. This craze infected Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith and culminated in the Book of Mormon and several other books and pamphlets, and finally in the restoration of an ancient but lost priesthood and church organization. The second part deals with adaptive changes by which revelations became familiar and mundane, and were used by Joseph Smith to obtain for himself a monopoly in seership and social control. The third part presents a period of competitive and contradictory revelations, in affirmation or rebuttal of various claims of succession to the headship of the church after the death of Joseph Smith. A number of the resultant sects are yet in existence, but revelation, in the old sense, has been tacitly abolished by the larger groups and the heavens are again silent. The mystic element has never been prominent in Mormon revelation. The appeal 373</page></plain_text>
