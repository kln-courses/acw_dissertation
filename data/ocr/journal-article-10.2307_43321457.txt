<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams: Death as Simultaneity in Siesta and Jacobs' Ladder Sharon Sieber "Every man's condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth." Ralph Waldo Emerson For the ancients, mimetic representation involved the copying of a para- digm - perfect nature - from one external medium to another. For the mod- erns, interior reality is the paradigm; and the images the artist tries to copy or externalize, whether in the visual or representational arts, are drawn from dreams and inwardly oriented states of consciousness. As attention is di- rected to this subjective reality, the objective reality of clock time and the physical perception of exterior space undergo the transformation of being per- ceived through interior worlds. This new kind of psychic space represents the exploration of other-dimensional worlds, interior worlds consisting of a dif- ferent kind of time and space, which the surrealists sought to codify through automatic writing and the exploration of dreams in film, literature, and the other arts. Octavio Paz in Children of the Mire suggests that the modern con- ception of time, like other conceptions, is pluralistic - not one time, but many times: "The tradition of the modern is thus radical otherness and plurality of pasts" (2). Because plot development traditionally implies the idea of progression and growth, a linear framework is intrinsically embedded in the structure and language of narrative prose and film. Cause and effect serve to bind together events which might otherwise appear episodic or coincidental, for the particu- lar brand of realism traditionally demanded by contemporary readers as mi- metic representation of exterior reality extrinsically emphasized causal relationships. Yet the kind of fragmentation we now see in the modern novel and in modern cinema embodies Carl Jung's sense of psychic time: flash-forwards and flashbacks are offered to the reader/viewer in such a way that he has to piece together for himself the real picture of the world that the writer/director puts before him. The modern reader no longer asks to have re- Vol. 14, No. 1, Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts 86 Copyright © 2002, Florida Atlantic University.</page><page sequence="2">Sharon Sieber ality inflexibly structured for him by the authoritative narrative voice of the text/film; in fact, modern mimetic representation demands that the reader make personal sense of the chaos of myriad data put before him - he puts to- gether the story as he puts together life. As Kathleen Komar notes in Pattern and Chaos, "Any reader contemplating contemporary literature is struck by the frequent appearance of novels in which the narrative text is fragmented, split up into several separate (and often seemingly unrelated) lines of narra- tion, a form characteristic of the works of Joyce, Dos Passos and Faulkner" ( 1 ). In The Manifold and the One, Agnes Arber explains how a "stringing-out process" or fragmentation into succession enables us to interpret linearly a universe which is essentially simultaneous in nature. Succession and mea- surement describe linear worlds where events happen in comfortable se- quence to allow the "stringing-out process" to fragment events from the larger body of simultaneous time and to organize consciousness according to pattern and succession. According to Arber, "By means of this stringing-out process the mind feels able to tackle the universe - fragmenting it in such a way as to make it amenable to ideas of cause and effect, but leaving the path open to subsequent reintegration" (81). We can see an extraordinary illustration of this mystical or spontaneous understanding in film, the genre most conducive to the expression of simulta- neity because of its potential for the abstract treatment and over-printing or over-laying of time and space. Just as the dream world of the ordinary indi- vidual broadens the experience of life, Arnheim notes in Art and Visual Per- ception that "The motion picture has broadened not only our knowledge but also our experience of life, by enabling us to see motion that is otherwise too fast or too slow for our perception" (385). Because in movies it is possible to visually compress or stretch out real events, we see a rose bloom in the space of a few seconds, trace the sun's trajectory across the sky in a few moments, or as in Arnheim's example, "see a drop of milk bounce back from a surface in the shape of a beautiful white crown, or a bullet slowly break up a wooden panel" (385). In Francis Ford Coppola's presentation of Koyaanisqatsi_( a Hopi word meaning "crazy life, life in turmoil, life disintegrating, life out of balance, a state of life that calls for another way of living," directed by Godfrey Reggio, 1983), we see the exquisite rhythm and synesthetic pattern- ing of cities, weather, traffic and civilizations, heightened by Phillip Glass' musical interpretation of the converging images. Simultaneity is expressed in this film through the synchronization of music and images; the combination of music and images creates meaning, which in turn is an analogy for synchronicity or secret correspondences. These Baudelairian correspon- dences involve the transference of meaning between one system and another, centering upon the correctness of fit between music and image, or the synchronicity of visual and auditory perception to create a language that 87</page><page sequence="3">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams Octavio Paz has referred to as the "universe's double," a parallel language of parallel worlds ( Children of the Mire, 72). For Roy Armes, film has broken down the old sense of narrative by changing the nature of perspective altogether: the long shot, the close-up, and the medium shot have created new relationships between space and time, em- phasizing the simultaneity of the medium (the power of the medium to repre- sent simultaneous images). According to Armes, "Both cubists and film-makers were engaged in creating a new way of perceiving reality": By approaching objects and situations from several angles simulta- neously and fusing the fragmental images into a new synthesis (full-face and profile in the same painting; long shot, medium shot and close-up all used to analyse a single film scene), they created new relationships between space and time, between objects among themselves and between objects and the spectator, who was called upon to look at the resulting work - painting or film - in a new way. (171) What the cinema changed was the physical representation of the psycho- logical reality of simultaneity. This was especially effective since the cinema qua cinema is an art form built on time and visual movement. The form is used to demonstrate something beyond itself; it represents time and space mi- metically but also transcends traditional boundaries of time and space. In the cinema, we view our dreams as actuality, they become real and take on sub- stance. Movies, like dreams, cover a span of a thousand years in a moment of real time; also, as in dreams, they transcend traditional limitations of space: we walk on water, fly through space with our bodies, watch the rhythmic and endless transformation of one image into another. They portray other worlds, inner realities: dreamtime, which functions within the larger structure of dream memory, where the dreamer remembers things, events, or places about which the conscious mind has no recollection. According to Freud in The In- terpretation of Dreams, It may happen that a piece of material occurs in the content of a dream which in the waking state we do not recognize as forming a part of our knowl- edge or experience We are thus driven to admit that in the dream we knew and remembered something which was beyond the reach of our waking mem- ory. (45) Events acquire a history in the dream state which expands outward from the moment point of the present in the dream, and this history is acceptable to the larger identity of the dreamer in a way that the conscious ego is unable to assimilate. A case in point is the recent movie, Jacob's Ladder (1990, di- rected by Adrian Lyne), a powerful vision of a world populated with angels and demons, laden with Judeo-Christian imagery and icons, imbued with a 88 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="4">Sharon Sieber powerful history of Old Testament names and devils. Jacob 's Ladder resem- bles a zen koan in its compactness and complexity, along with the traditional presence of embedded and perceived meaning which extends beyond the con- taining structure or vehicle of expression and operates on a gestalt level, defy- ing logical explanation. A probable future expands from the dream reality to become part of a larger "present" shared by Jacob's multiple selves. Jacob awakens into a dream from another dream, and, assuming his current reality to be the real one, he tells his wife about the "other" dream in which he lives with another woman, only to awaken once more to the "dream." From the stand- point of the dream, the present moment contains a probable future, complete with a probable past leading up to that moment. Jacob is able to trace those events on a line: these are parallel worlds, or "parallel universes," running side by side, unknown the one to the other until a light shining in both worlds temporarily reveals to the protagonist the existence of another world. Jacob has simultaneous lives, or simultaneous realities within one identity, and liter- ally encounters his symbols as reality. Reality is converted into a symbol, a language, or a "parallel language," and in turn "parallel universes," which is not the experience itself, but a metaphor for that experience. The bridge which unites the two worlds is the pervading mist, and it is this same type of mist which enables Jacob to align his separate realities neatly and coherently, until the presence of demons alerts him to the fact that something is wrong with one or another of his worlds. The modern feature film Siesta (1987), directed by Mary Lambert, is an- other illustration of the successful (or mimetic) portrayal of dreamtime. The main character is compelled to understand, through the juxtaposition of suc- cessive flashbacks and fragmented non-linear, almost purely "experiential" sequences, that the entire experience she struggles to comprehend and come to terms with is her own death, although from the perspective of conscious- ness that is no longer linear-oriented. She cannot comprehend the "entire" event until it is explained for her sequentially through the modal aspects of her once linearly-attuned consciousness. In narrative literature, fictional events which take place in the real or "waking" world are often interpreted symboli- cally (particularly in psychoanalytic criticism), but when dreams appear in the fictional world, the apparently chaotic symbols or images which they invoke are interpreted as events or experience. In film narratives, the nature of the image involves a highly codified means of interpreting sequence and pattern, so that the viewer can perceive what prose narratives communicate best through a linear medium: the interior world of the characters. Although the protagonist doesn't realize this until the denouement, she has been dead from the moment the viewer begins monitoring her progression, as she moves from confused noncomprehension to alarmed understanding. The viewer has to be able to follow in linear fashion where the character is going, from a "reading" or interpreting of the images. In this case, the viewer is experiencing with the In the Arts 89</page><page sequence="5">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams protagonist the information as she perceives it in a sort of Jamesian limited perspective and is not privy to the omniscience of superior knowledge. There are strong indications that someone is dead, however, for when she awakens just outside the airport to her badly bruised and lacerated body, buzzards cir- cle ominously overhead and continue to pursue her as she walks down the lonely road where she is the only traveler. Compelled by her strong emotions to find out what happened, she is afraid that the real reason she doesn't re- member clearly is that she herself is the murderer. She progressively goes through the stages of the terminally ill, beginning with denial: looking at her torn and blood-stained dress, she says aloud: "That's not my blood. It must be somebody else's. I must have hurt him. I must have hurt him pretty bad" (Si- esta, 1987). She hopes that if she has killed someone, it isn't the man who continues to draw her to the physical world. The linear aspects which she attempts to understand are incomprehensi- ble from the point of view of her dissociated "dead" consciousness. Later on, trying to return to her own familiar world in the taxi, she notices a strange oc- currence: her bruises and cuts have all disappeared. She is "whole" again. Suddenly aware that she has no money, she bargains with the taxi driver who attempts to extract a physical promise that she will sleep with him in exchange for taking her where she wants to go. But events have a way of taking on bi- zarre twists and physically, she is obstructed and distracted again and again as she tries to reach her destination in the real world. She is still far from accept- ing her state; again, paralleling the stages of death, she must work through her own emotions to understand what has happened in her own terms. The parallels in this film in terms of the links, or segues, in order for the viewer to make sense of the actions, are very similar to the way these transi- tions are handled in Jacob 's Ladder. The title, Siesta, is of course a clue for us, as Claire, the main character comments throughout the film that she needs sleep, but her "siesta" at the airport, is of course, the sleep of death. As view- ers, we see her awaken from lying in a field, as a plane comes in for a landing directly over her, and then we begin to experience all of the action that occurs from her third-person limited perspective. She is both confused and fright- ened at the multiple situations that she finds herself in, and as she tries to piece together the recent events of her life, the associative path of her thoughts seems to first give order, in the form of a flashback, and then to present confu- sion, as two separate events also (as in Jacob 's Ladder) share the same mo- ment in time and space. The juxtaposition and overlay of these events force the viewer to sort out these events at exactly the same pace as Claire. Em- blematic of her life, the slogan, "Live fast, die young," appears on the wall of her and her husband's apartment. These images form a sort of collage, as her former lover, Augustin (whom she flies to Spain to meet when she receives a letter from him informing her that he is about to be married), tells her that this jump into a volcano which her husband has planned for her on Independence 90 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="6">Sharon Sieber Day will surely lead to her death: "What you are doing is meaningless. Listen to me, Claire. I taught you to fly. You chose to fall. Your life means more to me than my own" (Siesta). We hear Claire's husband in the background, hyp- ing her daredevil stunt: "See Claire on a dare defy death. Celebrate Independ- ence Day by watching her jump into a volcano." She consistently misinterprets the world around her: her picture in a newspaper describing her as missing becomes the basis, along with the blood on her dress, for her fears that she has done something terrible. Entering a church she tells us, "I'm not a religious person but I think I might be in some kind of trouble. I think they must be looking for me." Then, as she kneels before the altar, she says, "Oh my God, I'm falling." From here, the flashback moves from falling out of an airplane as part of her daredevil stunt to making love with her lover, and the brief, choppy presentation of these "shared" moment points leads the viewer to perceive one image turning into another, or a "sharing" of the same space, as their clasped hands are instantaneously replaced by the image of an up- raised knife, poised to strike. When she finally remembers to ask what day it is, she panics, saying out loud, "Oh God, I really blew it. . . I lost four days, Je- sus, how did I screw up like that?"(Sïes/a). The rest of the film involves her putting together the events of those four days, "explaining" to herself, and at- tempting to understand her "current" situation which cannot be explained in the usual way-that is, by calling her husband or asking someone who knows her what has happened they are somehow unavailable, as they would be in death, and she has to piece these events together for herself. When she is with Kit, her self-proclaimed "guardian angel" (interestingly, she is looking for someone to take her to the city of "Angeles"), a fight breaks out at the gallery where he is showing his prints (and where a large print of her face is promi- nently, yet inexplicably, displayed), and Kit throws the owner of the gallery through a plate-glass door. Juxtaposed against this same moment is a simulta- neous scene in which she is spying on her lover with his new wife in their house from her vantage point in a nearby tree. She sees him brushing his wife's hair, and she jumps down in anger, throwing what appears to be a rock through the window. As the window breaks, the camera substitutes the "other" scene, in which someone is thrown out of the window as a matter of fact, it is the gallery owner, and we seem to be back in the "present" with Kit and Claire, and once again Claire begins to agonize about perhaps having killed someone. This time Nancy, Kit's friend, reassures her: "Killing some- one is not something one forgets" (Siesta). Finally, they all fall asleep out- doors. When she awakes, Claire asks Kit: "Where did you go?" to which he counters with a variation of the theme Ubi sunt, "Where did we go?" He then addresses a statue, quoting from Alexander Pope's Ode 442, "The Dying Christian to His Soul": "Tell me, my soul, can this be death?/ The earth re- cedes and disappears/ Heaven opens my eyes/ my ears with sounds seraphic ring / Lend me thy wings, I mount, I fly/ O grave where is thy victory?" When In the Arts 91</page><page sequence="7">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams she finishes the poem by supplying the ending, biblical line, "O Death, where is thy sting?" Kit responds, "Well, blow me over" (Siesta). Perhaps she is al- ready beginning to understand. Ironically, she tells Nancy that her life "has been like a complicated chess game. He [Augustin] makes a move and he dares me to follow. I do, and I dare him to match me." Processing her death is now the "complicated chess game," and Claire wants to escape. Nancy promises to take her to the airport, and interestingly as they drive by, she sees her own red dress and a garbage bag nearby, along with vultures - and planes - flying overhead. Pro- phetically, she utters to herself, "Somewhere - I don't know where I turned a corner and there was no turning back" (Siesta). As we perceive spontaneously the whole sentence before communicating it in the successive medium of language, so the protagonist perceives (but doesn't understand) the whole event or series of events which lead up to and comprise her death from a simultaneous point of view. "What's happened to me?" she questions genuinely throughout the progression of events (Siesta). Yet this knowing must be translated to the disoriented and disembodied self, whose emotional attachment still ties her to the physical world, urging her to find a logical explanation for the rupture from the linear world and its present. Paradoxically she can only perceive the physical world through the moment of reflection on past events or memory - she gets nowhere by trying to manip- ulate in the physical world. Only through turning her focus inward is she able to make progress and follow time on the continuum of the line that she knew so well in the linear world. The present which she experiences in the linear unfolding of the movie is a creative exploration of her consciousness from death's perspective. She does not comprehend her experience as removed from the logical and orderly physical world, however, because her identity hasn't yet assimilated the fact that she is dead - nor does the viewer at any point suspect that she is dead until the end of the movie. The film narrative takes on the role of prose narrative in juxtaposing a sequence of carefully con- structed images so that we are able to follow her serial world recollections. And we as viewers are asked, through the powerful presentation of physical images, to participate with the main character in the experience of her own death. These are worlds of multiple "presents," where the chaotic environment of the dream world becomes a metaphor for the experience of death. Corre- spondences and analogues serve to unify experience in a world we cannot know with our senses, a world described by A. R. Ammons as having "no perceiver": "You cannot come to unity and remain material: in that percep- tion is no perceiver" (23). Yet the imagination plays with these ideas as well as with the creative interpretations of the similarities in the symbolism and mythology of dreaming and dying: the boatman who ferries souls across the river Styx (in this case, the taxi driver); her recurring dream vision of falling 92 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="8">Sharon Sieber from an airplane with no parachute (apparently not a problem since she is a daredevil acrobat and professional stunt woman); and the four stages of death - denial, bargaining, depression, acceptance - and finally, transforma- tion. The mystics also seek to transcribe that world, as Jorge Luis Borges calls upon them for assistance in describing the unutterable Aleph. Simultaneity opens up time to its true field of probabilities, where the multiplicity of pres- ents are the rule and not the exception. In transcribing that world, the contin- uum of the line does not move in a direction toward the future, leaving the linear past behind, always suggesting the vanishing point; but rather it moves outward as concentric circles, with a ripple effect of non-contiguous actions. Past and future are transposed one over another in this film as multiple pres- ents, and as such there could be infinite presents, yet simultaneity is also a metaphor or an analogue for death and for the perspective of the dead. The protagonist of Siesta is the dreamer who doesn't know she is dreaming (an an- alogue for the dead man who doesn't know he's dead), even though her con- sciousness finds itself in a bizarre ambience where causal relationships do not apply and which the viewer senses has been conveniently created by her in the same instantaneous fashion that dream images are created. She knows that something is wrong with her world; ironically she needs rest yet cannot sleep in this permanent sleep: "I have to get some sleep, I don't feel so good" (Si- esta). Her waking or conscious world becomes the dream world, and her thoughts and fears are immediately actualized as she struggles to hold on to the single recognizable linear thread of memory which is woven into the cha- otic fabric of her dreamlike world. Unlikely guardian angels appear in strange guises; yet these are her symbols, and as viewers, we are able to make sense of what happens within the juxtaposition of her nonlinear dreaming symbolic world and the everyday world she remembers so well. It is ultimately her abil- ity to hold on to this linear thread within the framework of the unstructured and nonsensical events surrounding her that allows her to conclude her inves- tigation of these flashbacks, bringing her to the reality and realization that she is dead. There are acausal mechanisms of association at work here, for the in- congruity of the sexual act with the gross taxi driver leads to the non-contiguous world of her real lover, with whom she finds herself in the act of passionately making love - even while dissociating herself from the taxi driver who acts upon her inert non-physical "body," paradoxically now with- out her "conscious" spirit present. She is back in that "other" present, caught in the act of making love by the wife of her lover. The last part of her investi- gation unfolds as the insanely jealous wife fatally stabs her; the mystery un- equivocally unravels. She awakens once again to her dream reality of death (with the lustful taxi driver who is angry at her "absence," relating it to his in- ability to perform sexually and like the homicidal scene she has just "left," she finds herself once again in a situation of violence), and the juxtaposition of the In the Arts 93</page><page sequence="9">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams two worlds abruptly comes to an end. With horror, she finally allows herself to discover her own body at the airport where it has been dumped - a confron- tation that the viewer recognizes that she has been emotionally avoiding all along - thus reconciling her dreamlike mode of spontaneous perception with the sequential comprehension of her still linear-oriented consciousness. The idea of a universal grammar of dream symbols or images has long been in vogue, yet as Ferdinand de Saussure's principle of the arbitrariness of the relationship between sound and meaning applies to language, so does the meaning of the individual dreamer's symbol vary according to context and differs from dream to dream, or in this case, from one individual's death to an- other's. Yet it would seem that there is a kind of universal grammar in the dream landscape which pertains to the individual dream or to the dream as universe (just as the universe of the text obeys its own verisimilitude), or more precisely to the way in which dreams are constructed, a kind of dream gram- mar which can be applied to the construction of dream sentences or recurring sequences of patterns. An even stronger example of this kind of symbolism, where dream sym- bols take on a reality larger than life so that nothing appears without a motive, is in Jacob 's Ladder, as the title suggests, everything that happens in the dream is reduced or expanded to a symbol. The symbolism on the surface seems rather formulaic and contrived: the battle between good and evil, de- mons and angels, traditional images of white lights, birds in flight as an ana- logue for the soul leaving the body, mirrors reflecting other worlds, spirit guides and protectors against demons. Yet all appear in this movie within the framework of logical ordinary reality. On the subway, Jacob glances up to read a mundane placard which announces in large letters "Hell. That is what life can be doing drugs"; we have a hint of where Jacob is going and what is happening to him (Jacob 's Ladder). Ironically, the only images which have the appearance of unreality are those fragments which reflect the status of Ja- cob Singer's physical body in real space and time, coupled with the distance from which he perceives through the senses still connected with that body. The power of the dream and overwhelming sense of helplessness that one feels when "trapped" in the dream state are Kafkesque sensations, similar to those experienced by Gregor in "The Metamorphosis" and allow the reader/viewer to empathize with Jacob even as this sensation of helplessness reinforces the bizarre ambiance of alienation and defamiliarization created by this waking nightmare. "The Metamorphosis," is important in the context of the dream, because it is the manifestation of both the mythos and the pathos of the modern period which represents the emotional alienation of modernity, and has all the underpinnings of the power of the mythological truth of epic narratives. And, just as the simultaneity of Gregor's human perception within that body begins to break down normal patterns of linear consciousness with that of an insect (there is an immediate overlapping of realities as Gregor's 94 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="10">Sharon Sieber sensibilities are merged with those of an insect), so Jacob's living concerns begin to turn from anthropomorphic symbolism to symbol as direct experi- ence of death. Jacob is a Vietnam veteran with a Ph.D. in philosophy, who not coinci- dentally works in a post office, since this is one coordinate in time and space where messages are sent out and received. Jacob is likewise receiving and sending messages from the disconnected parts of his own psyche, and the points of contact between these "selves" are points of shared reality which - although they serve to connect the multi-experienced events - are in- terpreted differently by various aspects of Jacob's larger self. These varied interpretations are comparable to examining the underside of the events them- selves within the reality of the film in terms of the ways the moments are shared and appear to occupy the same space. The love scene between Jacob and Jezzie in the safe universe of the shower imperceptibly fades into the la- bored breathing of the soldier Jacob as he slowly attempts to progress through the vulnerable world of the wet jungle on his belly with his entrails protruding through his abdomen; yet there is a sense of defamiliarization as Jacob looks up and attempts to bring into focus his blurred surroundings. Again, there is an attempt to connect: the shower becomes the rain that is lightly falling and has permeated everything. Turning over on his back, Jacob's glance is drawn to what is immediately above him. It is difficult to interpret what the object is from Jacob's perspective, until suddenly in sharp focus we see a spider's web, perfectly symmetrical, raindrops glistening with mystical light from its an- gles, shocking both Jacob and the viewer with its simplicity, yet it is singu- larly magical. He gasps as he sees a rescue party ahead and barely is able to whisper, "Help me"; he simultaneously awakens in his own bedroom, calling for help from his "dream" of crawling through the jungle. The spider's web serves as a compressed symbol for the film in its en- tirety. It portrays the fragile interweaving and connectedness of all the actions of the characters and the ramifications of these events on one another's lives; and it is the fragile and beautiful web of life in which Jacob is caught on the one hand, and on the other, it is the web of life to which he tenaciously holds as the tenuous connections with his outer reality begin to fade and take on a completely symbolic nature. The web of life draws him back into the com- plex web of dreams and is itself a symbol uniting both worlds, waking and dreaming, in a web of probabilities. The dream from which he awakens links him to that same defamiliarized sensation which he experienced in the jungle in his inability to comprehend, and then the shock of recognition of the mysti- cal and mundane spider's web is perhaps symbolic of the "shock" of con- sciousness undergoing the transformation of death. He sees it fresh as though for the first time, freed from the initial structuring experience of pattern recog- nition. The moment of recognition causes a reinterpretation of the reality that surrounds him as the subsequent "merging" of the two worlds takes place, and In the Arts 95</page><page sequence="11">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams both strive to contain or supersede the other and organize it into meaningful experience. This recognition, which involves the perception of a spider's web and the sensation of his own consciousness waking into a strange and momen- tarily unfamiliar world, creates a distance or "lag" between Jacob's percep- tion and his own experience, so that he is both himself and the person who observes himself objectively if somewhat suspiciously from a still larger per- spective. Dreams have long held an important place in literature in terms of motif, prefiguring and expansion: in Homer's Odyssey, Penelope asks Odysseus, who is disguised as a beggar, to interpret her dream of the eagle which kills her 20 pet geese. In fact, the famous "gates of horn and ivory" are an ancient reference to dreams which deceive and dreams which are true. The evocative image of the gates from antiquity would seem to indicate the importance of the dream in the everyday contemporary life of the ancients and the continuity of that importance to modern times. Kafka's Gregor wakes from an unsettling dream into a nightmare in which he finds himself in waking reality trans- formed into a "gigantic insect." Dreams represent the unfamiliar, the unex- pected reversals and peripeteia that make up life's paradoxes, the world turned upside down, and the transformation of simplified old structures into complex gestalts of meaning. The usual "Am I dreaming question" is exchanged in Jacob 's Ladder for "Am I dead?" - or else Jacob is countering those who tell him he's dead with a strong assertion of "I'm alive!" Jacob grapples with systems and beliefs both on a real and symbolic level, for he encounters his dream symbols di- rectly as reality, a system much like the epic one where myth and history merge. His multifaceted dreams within dreams are interconnected and each affects the other, like tremors which ripple through, disrupting yet connecting his simultaneous events. Acausally, from one dream to another, Jacob re- members, "There were demons. I was burning from ice" {Jacob 's Ladder). The juxtaposition of his fever and soaking in a tub full of ice are not remem- bered causally from dream to dream: they merge, and yet they are meaningful: in Jung's terms, they contain both simultaneity and meaning, and the events are interconnected through synchronicity. This movie represents a different way of seeing or viewing, similar to the re-reading of a text, in which dream events and symbols are so embedded one inside another, creating structure and counter structure, that more than one viewing is necessary to begin even to understand the interplay and interweav- ing of dream imagery. On first viewing, there is no way of knowing that the entire world unfolding before Jacob is a dream. Everything that has happened from the moment the viewer sees him awaken on the subway is filtered through his semi-alert consciousness, as from time to time he perceives fleet- ingly the status of his physical body being transported by medics in a helicop- ter. Consequently, there is no way to verify in the outside world any of the 96 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="12">Sharon Sieber events taking place in the dream. Yet the dream is the direct interpretation of his experience of dying, and the symbols he chooses to represent that experi- ence are meaningful in the same way that literary images are meaningful and multifaceted in interpretation - there is sequence and association and affec- tive significance. The linear, sequential event of viewing the film becomes a moment of simultaneous understanding or illumination only at the last mo- ment, which coincides with the last moments of the main character's life. The piece of the puzzle that is missing for both the viewer and the main character to make sense of the unfolding of events is supplied only at the end of the story-line, and that information causes a reinterpretation of everything that has taken place up to that moment. The main character, Jacob, has been stabbed and is in the process of dying. The underworld through which he travels, the subway (which marks his first ascent) to which there is no exit, the corridors and basements of hospitals with their varying levels of Dante's Inferno, represent something similar to Saint John's dark night of the soul. As he is being wheeled down to X-Ray, people are literally leaving their bodies behind, first, in spirit (we see bodies, inhabited only by madness), then, as the journey continues, we see organs, hands, feet, limbs left behind. "You're in hell," the doctor confirms as a hypo- dermic is injected into his forehead {Jacob 's Ladder). Once more he wakes to yet another dreaming self. In his Cántico espiritual, Saint John of the Cross says, "I climbed the secret ladder, in disguise," and he explains the poetical line, which also marks the trajectory of Jacob's wanderings: "This secret wis- dom is a ladder on which the soul climbs upward and downward, until it at- tains to mystical union" (qtd. in Stace 196, 198). Finally, a ferryman, a taxi driver, arrives to take Jacob home. The focus of the camera makes the viewer aware that the meter is running, and that like- wise, time is running out for Jacob. He has assimilated the information gath- ered from various portions of his dreaming psyche; the message he's been looking for ("Hey, wait a minute Mr. Postman") comes to him in the taxi, that modern transformational vehicle which conducts him to the threshold of an- other world ( Jacob 's Ladder). Prepared now to accept the reality of death, he recognizes the event which precipitated his travels through the images and symbols of fighting for his life, which become increasingly more violent, de- manding resolution. Jacob is finally ready to die, and like Odysseus, he is ready after his long voyage to return home; a touching scene of recognition precedes his final departure as Sam, the doorman, welcomes him to his old home and to his former self: "Dr. Singer, it's been a long time." The entire unfolding of events which takes place as a dream within a dream {ad infinitum) is in itself an interpretation of the experience of dying within Jacob's interior world. As he dies, his symbols grow less anthropo- morphic: the violence which has plagued Jacob throughout changes into dis- jointed memory flashes, and finally, his symbols are not meant to be In the Arts 97</page><page sequence="13">A Syntax of Symbols in the Representation of Death and Dreams interpreted by humans at all: the last symbol which he interprets is a kite fly- ing against a bright sky: freedom which in turn becomes nothing. His heart- beat, synchronized throughout with the rotary motor of the rescuing helicopter, becomes separate and arrhythmic; after the last heartbeat, there is darkness. There are several false awakenings as Jacob attempts to move from the reality of the dream to the reality of the world, but the real "awakening" is that Jacob finally wakes up to die. And, in dying to the world, he opens up to the universe of death. Jacob finally masters the ascent of the ladder. The final interweaving of realities in the presentation of this movie is the written message which appears as fact in the actual world at the end of the film: "It was reported that the hallucinogenic drug BZ was used in experi- ments on soldiers during the Vietnam war. The Pentagon denied the story" ( Jacob 's Ladder ): yet another twist, connecting the film to the reality of the viewer. The coherent presentation of a cohesive objective reality from a tradi- tional narrative point of view is truncated when Jacob is stabbed: it resumes once again when he is dead. Everything depicted after the stabbing takes place through the unverifiable, interior, and subjective world of the dream. Yet the dream is verified through the presentation of this outside information. Outside of the universe of this film representing the reality of a problematic war, there was allegedly another reality of a government surreptitiously ex- perimenting with hallucinogenic drugs upon the minds of soldiers already vested with an hallucinogenic reality: war. Once more we are reminded of the beginning, of the official message on the subway wall: "Hell. That is what life can be doing drugs." Yet there was another message on the wall of the termi- nal: "Ecstasy." And once more we are forced to reinvent the story in light of this new fact. Simultaneously, the story, as it moves from structure to struc- ture, has meaning in the synchronicity of each interpretation, in the fluidity of the interchanging and hierarchical internal structuring. This twist of realities in Jacob 's Ladder has been compared to a short story written near the turn of the century by Ambrose Bierce, in which Cathy N. Davidson describes the narrative trap set for the reader as a final twisting or reintegration of values: "the real trap sprung in 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge' is the fatal pre- sumption that war can have a happy ending" ("Foreword" 2-3). And "ecstasy" or what has become a metaphor for the mystical experi- ence, is also a means to explore simultaneity. And, time which is continually defining itself as "other" involves a notion of time which possesses a constant awareness of what it is: a contradiction in terms, a conceptualized self-aware time. We have all confused dream events with reality, and reality, likewise with dream events. In this lies a hint of the true nature of simultaneity, which in a sense is to confuse one kind of time or one kind of world with another, and in which an overlay of probabilities crisscrosses into many other kinds of real- ities, each maintaining its own separate thread or identity while taking part in a larger picture as well. We are beginning to see the creative manipulation of 98 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="14">Sharon Sieber different kinds of time flourishing in all the genres, but especially in cinema, where revolutionary experiments with time and space may be visually pre- sented, and in which the abstract presentation of objectified time and concep- tualized space defy traditional limits of realism in favor of the boundless imagination. Jacob 's Ladder and Siesta represent the enormous potential of cinema for exploring simultaneity through the merging of time and space in dreaming and dying, and they provide the viewer with a syntax of death and dying symbols, superimposed upon individual and collective dream sym- bols - in short, a primer for the modern aesthetic of simultaneity.
