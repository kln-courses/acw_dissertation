TIlE Arab 'imb hold a prominient place in tlle younlg Science of R'eligioni iii coiniection witlh a theory n1ow nmuch1 in vogue. They have been represented as survivals of ancient Semitic religion,-survivals which in(dicate that tlle Semites passed through a stage of toteimiism before they arrived at their conceptionis of traniscendental gods. This hypothesis, which has gainedl much adlherelnce, seems to me to require reconsideration. Before proceeding to discuss tlle origin of the belief in g 2in, lhowever, I shall give a detailed account of the belief itself, and this accounit I shall base upon tlle present superstitionis of tlle people of Morocco amonig wlhoilm I have spent nearly a year, and to whom I shall sooni retturin, with a view of examuinin, the traces of Pre-Mullainiedaim belief still existilng amllonlg themn.1 The belief in ghcda2' formiis a very imllportanlt part of the acttual creedt of the Muhliaimumiiedan populationi of Morocco, Arab acand Berber alilke. It pervades all classes, and thotulgh somlie of the miiore enllightened Moors are inclinied to reprcseit it as a suLperstitioln of the ignoralnt, I doubt whether there is aniyolne who does nlot practically adhere to it. The colmmiiionl people speak of the YN9it as ulnreserivedly as of mluon anid women, anid do nlot hesitate to claim a personlal acquaintanlice witl themii. In conisequienice, it is comiiparatively easy to acquire anl accurate knowledge of their belief. The gnh4'a forium a special race of beings, created before Adamii. Iln various respects, however, they are like menl.

The people knew of her from her doings. One morning her husband was found in his bed with his legs tied up. He had quarrelled with his wife, and she had taken her revenge in this way, whilst he was asleep. As a rule, however, she was kind to him. He had always money, he was well dressed, and possessed many guns,-which could only be accounted for by his having a 'innia for his wife. This was, after all, an unusually happy instance, for connections with 'ndn generally result in madness. 6nAQn may be met with anywhere, but certain places are especially haunted, inesknimn ( At Tanigier they have tbeir favourite abode on the sea-shore; at Fez in anl old fort; at Marrakesh their sultans assemble in the big well called l-bigr I-4adddd, at Tetuan in the spring l-kna' l-kb'r. They inhabit rivers, woods, the sea, ruins, houses, and particularly springs, and drainis, and caves, and other undergrounLid places. Their native country is below the surface of the earth. There they have villages and towns, and live in tribes or nations, each of which has its sultan. But they are not tied down to anly particular spot, and sometimes they travel great distances. They are constantly coming forth to the upper world, more especially when it is dark. Hence, a Moor's fear of the gn1n practically commelnces with the twilight. There are streets in which he will not venture to walk at night, and houses which are unainhabited because nobody dares to sleep in them. In Marrakesh I heard of a man who nioved out from his house regularly every nigiht. Most Moors are afraid of sleeping alone in a room, especially if the door be left open, and to sleep in a stairway is regarded as particularly dangerous. It would require still greater courage to pay a nocturnal visit to a place where cattle are slaughtered, as the YnU4n lhave a special predilection for places where there is blood. As soon as it gets dark, too, a Moor will carefully abstain froilm pouring out hot water on the grounld. The gnAn have no fixed forms, but may assume almiiost any shape they like. They appear now as men, and now as goats, cats, dogs, donkeys, tortoises, snakes, or other animals,-now as monsters witlh the body of a mani anld the legs of a dolnkey, now in other shapes,-sometinmes, for instance, with seven heads. A man told me thiat once in his youth he ilmet a little baby wvhich suddenly clhallged into a giant. The molnster, which was, of course, a gin",n, gave him a blow wvhich made him lame for three years. One eveining my servant, 1-'Arbi, saw a ginn in the offices attached to a mosque. The ginn was white, had long hair, and was scratching its head. L-'Arbi, who was frightened, called tlle night-watch, aild the ginn then ran away in the shape of a red dog. L-'Arbi asserted that hie was out of his miiind for a imionth afterwards, and then a magiciani cured him by writiing hini a clharmii. In miiy house at Marrakesli imiy sleep was (listurbed by the nioise of a cat. Wheni I told my servants to drive the creature away, they answered me that nio Moor would ever dare to hit a cat in the dark, sinice it is very doubtful what sort of beinig it really is.

The columins of sand or dust wlhich often travel across the plains of Morocco are caused by yn'An. In some places such a miniature cyclone is called l-'ammarita del-'nqm i j "the bridal box of the 'nAn," in other places, 'airily (,;Ju, this being the name of an 'dfrit(s), or strongo, nn. Ignis fatuus is a fire kindled by gnAn. A falling star is a dart thrown by the angels at a ginn who tries to get up to heaven. The big stones in the walls of Mequinez were carried there by gnxun, being, too heavy for any man to lift. Dear times are caused by manygn?%n being in the town and eating up the food. When a man stumbles in the dark, some people say that he trod on a igtnn. The Imlost usual way in which the gnAn make their presence felt is by causing sudden disturbances of the health, such as convulsions, epileptic and paralytic fits, rheumatic and neuralgic pains, fits of madness, and certain epidemics which are rare and violent, like the cholera. In these cases the g'inn works its will by striking its victim, and by entering his body, or sometimes, in cases of epidemics, by shooting an arrow at him. When the cholera was in Morocco some years ago, the people believed that an army of gynqln had overrun the country. Where the epidemic was very violent, the gnAn were supposed to have pitched their tents inside the town wall, whereas the occurrence of a few cases only indicated that they were camping outside the town, and now and then making a hit with their poisoned arrows. I was told at Tetuan that those who died were followed to the grave by an unusually great number of people, and that for the following, reason: -when a dead inan was buried, the enemy at once looked out for another victinm, and let his arrow fly among the crowd at the grave, and, therefore, the bigger the crowd, the less the individual risk. Jackson, in his account of the plague which raged in Morocco a century ago, also states that those who were attacked by the plagtue were supposed to have been shot by "genii " armed with arrows.' It should, however, be noticed that by no means all kinds of illnesses are attributed to the tricks of the gYn14n, but only sudden and unusual ones. Fever, typhoid, small-pox, etc., are sent by God; aiid there are many people wlho assert that all diseases are punishments iinflicted lipon mankind by God, and that the gynqlg, when attacking men, only do so by His command. A man seized with sudden fear is peculiarly liable to the attacks of the gnAn. If he then fall a victim to them he is said to have shad'ta ( If, for inistalnce, anyone falls ill after being frightened by a cat or a dog in a dark place, the animal is held to have been a yhinn, anid the man's illness is explainied by saying that the giginn entered ilito him and gave hiim ske!ta. Again, suppose a boy, whilst eatinga with his father, misbehaves in somie way. If, wlhen his father puniishes him, he begins to weep, the Ynh4n, which are always near people who are eating, easily seize him and give hiim sltata. It is bad to awakeen a imian out of sleep too suddlenly. He should be aroused slowly, as otlerwise he may be frightened and get sht4c'ta. It is also considered bad for a miian to look at himllself Jackson, An Account of the Empire of Alorocco (1814), pp. 176 sq. note.</page><page sequence="4">illustrated by the present beliefs of the People of Mforocco. 255 in a looking-glass in the evening, and somne people say that, if he does so, a ginn goes into his eyes and makes them sore. There is held to be something mysterious about the reflected image in the glass. There are good gnAn and bad ynAn, but the latter hold a much more prominent place in the popular creed. They are shiautan ( devils, and the worst of them is called Iblis, the devil, who is also termed shitan. The plural ibalis (ba- ), however, is sometimes used for bad g'nAn generally. Iblis has seven hairs on his chin, and a bad scar over one of his eyes. He it is who incites men to fight. If a man is pugnaciou,s, and his friends say, alld jinna'l sh-shitan ( Jv sn), i.e., " May God curse the devil," Iblis is frightened away, and the mian at once becomes quiet. Iblis tempts brothers to have illicit intercourse with tlleir sisters. When a man is about to give alms to the poor, Iblis restrains him. Iblis finds pleasure in seeing men do what is hatefnl to God. If anybody pollutes a mosque, or uses unclean liquid for his abluitions, or treats the Koran disrespectfully, he may be sure of gainiing Iblis's favour. Iblis rejoices when a man dies unmarried, and weeps when a young, mran takes to himself a wife. He gives people bad dreams, and when a man yawns, he dirties his mouth. The bad gniln being always ready to attack human beings, various means are used for keeping them at a distance. The gnnAn are afraid of salt and steel. Some Moors put salt in their pillows, or take salt in their hands when they go out at night, and if a man be frightened, it is advisable for him to eat salt. There are also people who put a knife near their pillow before they go to bed. A boy who was left alone in a house was attacked by #nAtn. They shut the door and blew out the light, but by rubbing a knife against the wall the boy succeeded in driving them out. The best, and, from a religious point of view, the correct preventive agaiinst the attacks of the gnan is the recital of passages of the Koran. A mian who passes haunted places in the dark will feel safer if he repeat the djatu 1-kursi. When a mian pours hot water on the ground, he generally says, bism illd, " In the name of God." The same words are uttered before every meal: he who neglects to say them will have 9"r&amp;in as table-companions. During, the holy month of Ramadan the g,nAn are confined in prison until the twenty-seventh night of that month. They are especially afraid of everytlling connected with the religion of the Prophet, and, hence, they have a great respect for his descendants, the shurfa. Wheni the Moors build a house or dig a well, they always take precautions against nynAn. The An'gera people put some salt and wheat and an egg in the ground, and kill a goat on the threshold of the new house; otherwise, they say, the children of the house wouldl be stillborn or would soon die. In various parts of Morocco some animal-a goat, or a sheep, or a cock, sometimes a bullock-is killed both when the founidation of a house is laid, and when the house is ready, or nearly ready for occupation. In the latter case the sacrifice takes place on the threslhold, and afterwards the slaughtered animal is eaten by the proprietor, his family, and iinvited guests. Whein a wvell is dug, a goat or a sheep is also killed, especially if</page><page sequence="5">256 EDWARD WESTERMARCK- The Natutre of the Arab 6iinn, there be no signs of water. In Angera I saw a well of which the lining brickwork was broken, and my native friends told me that it had cracked immediately after it had beeln built up, because no animal had been sacrificed to " the owners of the place." Every place has its gnAn, its owners, mwdlin l-mkan ( ,\ ,.). When travelling, the Moor asks for the protection of the spirits and the saints of the place in which he is going to pitch his tent. Every house, too, has its g#inn, good or bad. If the #inn be good, the iuhabitants will prosper; if bad, they will have misfortunes or soon die. When a Moor strikes a light in a dark room, he says, vnsa-l-hair 'aliltmrn jd mwdlin 1-mkzk-in ( . A "Good evening to you, oh ye owners of the place." The spirit of the house is frighteiled by dogs, by photographs, and by whistling. When a g'qnn has got hold of a man, various means are employed for driving him out. At Laraiche there is a sprinig near Sidi Bokii'adel's 4arnma ( or offering-place, into which people possessed with gnAn throw loaves of saltless bread. Some tortoises will probably appear and eat the bread, andl the man who has thrown it in, after sprinkling his body with water from the spring, believes that he has got rid of his comiiplainlt. Someone who had tried the cure told me that he threw into the water two loaves, one cold and the other hot, because, as lie said, his body was shivering with cold and burning with heat at the same time. I was informed at Marrakesh that a similar cure is practised lnear Glawi, in the Great Atlas. The patient throws a saltless loaf into the spring attached to Lalla Takerkut's sainthouse. Then he takes a bath in the spring, and the tortoises which eat the bread will rid him of the gnAn by biting him. Related to this means of expelling #nan is the so-called didfa ( j ), which is subject to many variations in detail. The following account shows one of the ways in which it is practised. A dish of fish or mleat is prepared, without salt. Part of it, together with some saltless bread, is eaten by the patient, and another part is put on a plate and taken by a black woman to some place haunted by 'ndn. She also takes with her, in her basket, a piece of a looking-glass, a miniature flag in seven colours, some sort of clumsy doll, and a copper coin, together with some burning charcoal and incense. Besides the patient, the other memnbers of his family may also partake of the dish, but, if they partake, they ougLht to salt what they eat. The woman who carries the basket must not speak to anybody she happens to meet, for otherwise the #nAn may go into her. Generally some hunigry dogs eat the food after the black woman has gone away. In Ebnf HIlu, again, the practice is to kill a cock, boil it, and to put its boiled flesh int6 a dish of sulest. The dish, when thus filled, is surmounted by the feathers of the dead cock, care being taken that none fall off. After the patient has tasted the dish, an old woman carries the rest to some sprinig which is haunted by 'n'4n, and on the following morning, if the food has disappeared, the feathers are brought back to the house, and burnt, and tlle patielnt inhbales the smoke. If, on the otlher hand, the food is left untouched, there is no hope of hiis recovery. I have also heard that, in some places, a cock is killed</page><page sequence="6">illutstr ated by the present beliefs qf the People of Morocco. 257 over the sick man's h-ead, without the orthodox ritual of turning it towards the East, and without any invocation of God. The cock, which should have the colour of the ginn that is troubling the patient, is then carried to a place haunted by gnAn. But this is called l-'dr ( not d-didtfa, which always involves the idea of a meal with gnAn as guests. Two or three different ideas seem to underlie these practices. Not only have we the idea of a sacrifice, but we have, also, the idea of enticing the ginn to leave the body of the patient, and, yet further, the idea of transferring the disease into some other body. The killing of tlhe cock is a sacrifice, and the d1idfa-meal has the character of a sacrificial meal. At the same time, there seems to be some hope that the gnzAn, being very greedy, will not be able to resist the temptation of the saltless delicacy. In the haunted place where the .1idfa-food is deposited, they assume the shapes of the tortoises or dogs, which are seen to eat the food brought there in the patient's behalf. The idea of transference, again, is indicated by the biting of the patient by the tortoises, by the doll which is put in the basket together with the food, by the fact that the woman who carries the d1idfa-food must not open her mouth, and by the belief, expressly held by some people, that the dogs which eat the dicdfa-food are not gn&amp;n, but real dogs, and that, after eating, they will be possessed by the #nAn that troubled the patient. The #nAn are divided into tribes, and each tribe has its special day for attacking human beings, as, also, its special colour. By ascertainiing the day when a ginn has entered a man, the magician can decide the colour of the ginn, and can take his measures accordingly. The so-called Gnawa, who stand in an especially intimate relation to the gnwan, and who are frequently called on to expel them from people who are ill, are said to dress both themselves and the patient in the colour of the ginn that is believed to be the cause of the patient's illness, but this I have not seen for myself. All the seven colours of the rainbow are used for magical purposes when the tribes of all the days of the week are concerned, and, also, when, as sometimes happens, the particular tribe immediately concerned cannot be found out. But a good magician, I am told, does not make frequent use of the seven colours. The colour of an animal which is offered to the g'nAn generally is black. The performance by means of which the Gnawa enideavour to expel the gn4Qn is often very complicated, and may last for days. They sing and dance; walk round the patient, and make wry faces close to him; take him on their necks and carry him about, etc., etc. On Saturdays they eat dirt, because Saturday is the day of the Jewish gnnAn, which are fond of dirt. I saw some of these practices performed in Marrakesh, when one of my servants feigned sickness, and the rnkaddam, or chief, of the Gnawa, together with an assistant, tried to curie him. I also called in a magician from SIus. He pressed my servant's thumb, pinlched his ear, and whispered into it passages from the Koran. He assured ine that it was sometimes necessary to continue such whispered recitations for houirs before the evil spirit would take flight. Passages of the Koran are also written upon a piece of paper,-which is often black, or coloured in accordaance with the colouir of NEw SERIES, VOL. II, Nos. 3 AND 4, S</page><page sequence="7">258 EDWARD WESTERMAROK.-Tlhe iYature of the Arab dinn, the gqinn, and the paper is then hung round the patient's neck or burnt before his nose. In the latter case it is the smoke from the burning paper that is supposed to expel the ginn. In cases of dlisease recourse is frequently hacl to beings who are sometinmes called sultans, and sometimes saints of the 4na1m. To this class belong Sidi Harnmu and his son Sidi Hamiuda, Sidi Maimun, Lalla Maimuna, Lalla Mlra, Lalla Rkteja, Sidli M'usa, Sidi Busahba, Slhum H'arush anid his sonl, sultan l-khal, Sidi Boknadel, etc. All these have their hammat(s), or offering places, which are often nothiing more than big stones near or in the sea. Opinionis vary, however, about the nature of these beings. Some of them are sai(l by certain people to be ordinary human saints, and their master is Mulai 'Abd I-KaIder, the sultan of all the saints. To the ginn-sultans offerings are miade by patients or their families, to enlist their assistance in driving away the molesting gVinn. Very frequently cocks are carried to the hctminat(s) of these saints, and are either slaughtered there, or left there alive. One morning at Tangier, I saw several women walk to a large stone in the sea, the hamvrr of Sidi Musa. They kissed the stone, placed oil it some canidles and inceense, aud had a bath on the other side of it. A regular ginbn-cult is practised by the Gliawa, of wlholmi we have already spoken. Tihey are usually, but not always, blacks from the Sudan, and they forin a regularly-constituted secret society. They live on more or less amicable terms with the gYnAn, and, as I have already said, are experts in exorcism. The Gnawa celebrate an annual feast at which they make sacrifices to the 'ndin. I was at Tetuan this year when the feast took place. The Gnawa went in procession, with noisy music, to a spring called 'aWin s-swaq, inear the Moorish cenmetery outside the town. They took with them a black bullock, a black goat, and a black donkey carrying several chickens of various colours. When they came near the spring they danced, burnt incense, and lighted candles. The bullock was then killed, aind the man who slaughtered it sucked blood from its throat. The other animals shared the same fate. Unifortunately I did niot arrive at the spot untit the proceedings were just over, butJ I am speaking from credible hearsay. Whell provisions are dear, the Gnawa go to the hamnma of some ginn-sultan,-Sili Hamrlu being a special favourite,-or to the place where the yinn-sultans generally reside. The Cnawa pretencd not only to expel gnAn, but, also, to attract them at their will. By inlhaling, the smiioke of a certain incense and by dancilng, they induce the gYn1n to enter their bodies, and, when tlhus possessed, they are able to tell future events. I have twice been present at a se'ance in the Moorish fashion. The magician, a black miian from Sus, wrote soimie mystic signs on a sheet of paper which he f astened to the wall. Havinig thus written a letter to the spirits, he blew out the light, anld demanded absolute silence. After a fow minultes a tremiiendous noise was lieard: the yiqn came down along tlle wall, and ran- to the magician.

The qinn once shook liands with me, and the hand</page><page sequence="8">illustrated by the present beliqfs c!f the People of Morocco. 259 was that of a man. The magician had no assistant. He was undoubtedly a good ventriloquiist, and endowed with exceptional powers of seeinlg in the dark. The gitAn are, generally speaking, lacking in inidividuality. Their charac- teristics are those of the species anid of the tribe. Each tribe has not only its special colour, but also its special religion. There are Muhammedan, Jewisb, Christian, ancd pagan q'itAn. Moreover, the different tribes attack men under different conditions. According to a manuscript which was given to me by a magician beloniging to the tribe Ebnl 'Arus, the Suncday yn4n will attack a man if he wash himself whilst perspiring; the Monday 4nrQn, if he walk on ashes at night; the Tuesday ghQem, if lhe walk on blood; the Wednesday Ynd'71, if lhe walk in a watery place; the Thursday Y'nV,n, if he tread Uponi them in the dark; the Friday gIAn, if he walk in dirt; the Saturday ynAgt, if lhe go ouLt at night in a state of perspiration. At the same timne, there are, as we have seen, among, the 2n2en, saints anid sultans who, at any rate, possess proper names, and there is one ginnfa who has a very distinct individuality, viz., 'Aisba Kaindisha. She lives in rivers, or wells, or in the sea. She appears ill various slhapes, now as a child, now as a grown- uip woman, witlh long hair anid a beautiful face, but with the legs of a goat or an ass. Sh-e knows the name of every imani, but when she calls anyybody he should not answer her, for she is very dangerous. Not only does she kill miien, she is, also, sometimes said to eat them. She will, however, disappear at once if a knife, or even a needle, be shown to her, for, like all gnAn she is afraid of steel. She seems to be known evervwhere in Morocco. The people of Tetuan say that she lives in the river, ouLtside the town, at a place where there is a ruined bridge. She seizes and kills people who bathe there; anid every year three or four men are said to fall victims to her in this way. In tlhe summer, when it is very warm, she is some- times seeni sittinig oln the slhore. At other places, she is said to dwell in the sea. A Moorish frienid of mine tells me that, in his childhood, his mother used to warn himn against 'Aisha Kandisha when he was going to bathe. She has a husbanid called Hammu Kaiu, wlho is lnot much spoken of. But in the neiglhbourhood of Mequlinez a man told me that he had once seen him in a river. The 'afcqrit, (J, i:) sing. 'ctfrit (a{,#)l form a special class of andn remarkable for great strength and ferocity, and, consequently, much dreaded. The Moors also believe in the existence of beings named gudl (J 1V) sing. gl (g&gt;d)l who have black faces and eyes like flaming fire, and are fond of human flesh. There are, however, no 9udl in Morocco. Tlley live only in the Sudan, and in Morocco one hears of them chiefly from mothers who want to frighten their children. I have beard solme people say that the gudl are not genzdn, but formn a species by themselves, whereas otlmers are of opiniion that tlley belonig to tlle ginn-kind. These are, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the main features of the belief in 4imin as it exists among, the people of Morocco at the present day.

It is related in hiistories that, in ancient times before the creation of man, a race of ginn " inhabited the earth and covered it, the land and the sea, and the plains and the mountains."l Hulman or animal characteristics are universally attributed to them. Of the belief in marriages between menr and female g'inn, there are instances recorded both in Arabic literature,2 ancd in Doughty's description of his recent travels in the Arabian desert.' According to a tradition from the Prophet, the ginn inhabit the land, the sea, and the air.4 They are stated to live not only in uninhabited places, such as deserts, marshes, dense forests, and inaccessible mountains, but also in the dwellinas of men.` In Mecca houses h1aulntedl by gzin are said to be meskbn.6 The modern Egyptians believe that the 'inm " iinlhabit rivers, raLined houses, wells, baths, ovens, and even the latrina."7 But in the East, as well as ill Morocco, their chief abode seems to be the uinder-world. In his Tq-avels in Ar-abia Deserta, Doulghty states, "They ilhabit seven stages, whiclh (as the seven heavens above) is the building of the under- world."8 They are frequently supposed to be guardians of hidden treasures.9 In Egypt, says Lane, it is a custom, " on pouring water, etc., on the groundl, to exclaim or mutter, 'Destoor,'-that is, to ask the permiiission or crave the pardon of any ginnee that may chance to be there."10 The fact that the chief fabode of the itnn is the under-world is, in fact, a corollary from the belief that they live in the dark and disappear at daybreak.1' Everywhere the 'inn are feared chiefly in the dark. TliLis, in Upper Egvpt, according to Klunzinger, nobody ventures to live in a house aloiie, to go out alone late at night, or to remain alone in a room at night.

An Arab told Doughty that " for a while he could perceive nearly a half part of all who bear the form of mankind to be jins."2 In the Arabian Nights they are often represelited as appearing, first of all, in a monistrous undefined shape, like aln eniormious pillar, and as only gradually assumllinlg a hlumlialn shape and less gigalntic size. The extreme changeability of the appearalnce of the ginn is wvell illuistrated in the twenty-second Night, where we read of an 'ifr t who came out of a water-tank in the seniblalnce of a m-touse. It grew alid grew, until it becamiie, first a coal-black cat, tlheln a dog, then an ass-colt, andl finally it became a buffalo. The Oriental ginn ilndicate their preselnce in very much the salme way tis their Moorish brethren. Lane says that it is the general belief of tlhe Arabs of Egypt that the whillwinid which raises the salnd in the form of a pillar is caused by tlle flight of olle of these beings.3 It seems quite probable that the idea expressed in the IKoraln4 that the y'inn were created of smokeless fire was derived from the stralnge phenomelnoni of ignis fatututs, which tlle present-day Arabs,5 like the Moors, believe to be lighted by ginn. The superstition with regard to a falling star finds support in sone texts of the Koran, according to which the gInn listen at the gate of heaven for scraps of the knowledge of futurity, and, when detected by the angels, are driven off, and pelted with shooting stars.6 Many Arabs ascribe the erection of the Pyramids, and all the most stupendous remains of antiquity in Egypt, to 6anin Ibn--ann and his servants, the g'inn, " conceiving it impossible that they couldl have been raised by lhuman hands."7 The Eastern 6inn as well as the Western Y'qan are also disease-spirits. They cause asplyxia, lumbago, epilepsy, epidemics, madness, etc.8 "Mankind, after the Arabs' opinion," says Doughty, " may be vexed in their bodies and minds by possession of the jan . . . Strange maladies and lunatic affections are ascribed to their influence; scorlned and bewildered persons are said to be 'bejinned,' mejntn, demoniacs."9 They also think that a man who is asleep ought not to be awakened; but the reason Dougghty gives for this opinion differs from that assigned by the Moors. The sleeping imail, he observes, "is as it were in trance with God."10 Iblis is, of course, known to all the Muihannmedan peoples.

Al-Buchary says that yawniincg comes from Iblis,l and the Egyptiau fellah believes tlhat "there is always a devil ready to leap downi his thloat in case he slhoukld happen to gape."2 The Eastern gii n are afraid of iron anid salt, as also of sacred words.3 Baroi von Kremer suggests that their fear of iron is owing to their fear of a loud rattling nloise, such as tllat prodcIIed by metal, but this view is hardly c orrect.4 Professor Tylor's explaniationi seems to me muclh more satisfactory. The yinn, he observes, are essenitially creatures belonginig to the ancient Stone Age, an1d the new metal is hatefuil and hurtful to them.5 It slhould be rememiibered that they are ilot afraid of any metal huit ironi or steel, and that they have the samiie dread of salt, which produces no noise, but which is also anl innlovation to the Arabs. There are Beduini tribes wlho, up to the present time, know notlhing of salt, andcL find the use of it ridiculous.' It will perhaps be suggested that the ginn fear salt because salt is sacred.7 But bread is held in equal veneration by all Arabic peoples, and is nievertheless much liked by the jinn; and iron is the very reverse of beinlg sacred. In Morocco, at least, it is regarded as sinful to cleave bread with a knife. Again, the fear in which the ginn stanid of passages of the Koran is easily explicable from the fact that Mulhairnmedanism was the successful rival religionl, which, thoulgh recognising the existence of ginn, attributed to thenm a very inferior position in the spirit-world. The Arabs of Egypt, according to L,ane, believe that, during the month of Ramnadan, the y'inqn are confined in prisonA. In Morocco, as we have already seen, the imprisonimlent is thought to last only unltil tlhe twenty-seventh night of that month, and the samne belief seems to prevail in Algeria.9 The Beduins of the Arabian Desert sprinkle blood Uponl newly-brokeni fallow, upon the foundation of a new building, and, also, whemi they open new wells or enlarge old ones.'0 In Al-He&gt;r, says Doughty, husbandmen " use to sprinikle new break-lan-d with the blood of a peace-offerinig: the like, when they build, they sprinkle uponl the stones, lest by any evil accidents the workmen's lives should be endangered.""1 It was the opinioni of the early Arabs, as it is of the present Moors, that particular ginn preside over particular places.

Wheni a child is ill, its mother puts seven loaves of bread unider its pillow, and tllen, after the childl has slept on thena for a night, gives themn to the dogs to eat.6 In the literature on the Eastern Arabs I have found nio exact counterpart to the Moorish dzidfa, but a very similar custom is reported to exist in Timbuctoo. Wheni a men is sick, we are told, some saint is asked what animal must be sacrificed for the recovery of the patient, whether a white cock, a red cock, a hen, an ostrich, an antelope, or a goat. " The animal is then killed in the presence of the sick, and dressed; the blood, feathers, and bones are preserved in a shell and carried to some remote spot, where they are covered and marked as sacrifice. No salt or seasoning is used in the ineat, but incenise is used previous to its preparation. The sick man eats as much as lie canl of the ineat, and all present partake; the meat amid what else is dressed with it, must be the produce of charitable contributions from others, not of the house or family; and every contributor prays for the patient."7 No idea of a tranisference of the disease is involved in this practice. Those parts of the animal whiclh are niot eaten by the patient anld his friends are expressly said to be covered, which is certainly not the case in Morocco, where an observant eye can frequently detect remains of the dlidfa-food on the roadside. Considering the important part the Gnawa play as exorcists in Morocco, it seems more than probable that many practices connected with the expulsion of ghban have a Sudanese origin. The Eastern yinn display lno miore individuality than the Moorish ones; rather less. The Moorish belief in g'inn-sultalns is evidently local. The ginn-society is made up after human fashion, anid, as the ancient Arabs were democrats, tlhere can be no doubt that their ginn were so too. Even Iblis is of foreign extraction.8 On the otlher lhand, as Morocco is a monarchy, 'it is only natural that its ynQn also slmould be monaarchists. Exactly the same is the case in India.

Doughty speaks of a monstrous creature believed in by some desert Arabs, who call it Sa'lewwah. " This salewwa is like a woman, only she has hoof-feet as the ass." A desert man told him that ",she entices passengers, calling to themii over the waste by their nanmes, so that they think it is their own mother's or their sister's voice."2 Von Kremer identifies this being with Gule, a femiale demon often mentioned in Arabian tales. Gule passes a solitary existence in the deserts, and appears to persons travelling alone in the night, and, being supposed by them to be herself a traveller, lures thein out of their way. She not only converses with the travellelrs, but sometimes prostitutes herself to them. She resembles both a woman and a brute. She has long pendant breasts, and the feet of an ass. Moreover, she is a nman-eater.3 This description of Sa'lewwah-&amp;ule recalls all the chief characteristics of the Moorish 'Aisha Kiandisha, except that the latter is intimately connected with the water, whereas the former is a desert demoln. But this distinction is hardly important, considering that the Moorish #nAn generally have their favourite abodes in watery places. I believe then that 'Aisha Kandisha is Sa'lewwah-Gule, somewhat modified; and just as 'Aisha Kandisha is married to Hammu Kaiu, so Gule has a male pendant called Kutrub.4 The Moorish gvtdl, on the other hand, have retained their Eastern character of residing in the desert, where they keep up their traditional reputation for feeding on hulmiiain flesh.5 The 'ctfa it(s), too, have their home in the East.6 Having thus analysed the belief in g4inn as it is known from direct observation alnd written records, we shall now turn to the question of its origin. The most famous explanation has been attempted by Professor Robertson Smith. He nmaintains that it requires a very exaggerated scepticism to doubt that the ginn are, mainly, nothing else than more or less modernised representatives of animal kinds, or totem animals. " In the old legends," he says, " the individual jinna who may happen to appear to a man has no more a distinct personality than a beast. He is only one of a group of beings which to man are indistinguishable from one another, and which are regarded as making up a nation or clan of superhuman beings, inhabiting a particular locality, and united together by bonds of kinship anld by the practice of the blood-feud, so that the whole clan acts together in defending its haunts from intrusion, or in avenging on men any injury dorie to one of its members. This conception of the communities of the jinn is precisely identical with the savage conception of the animal creation. Each kind of animal is regarded as an organised kindred, held together by the ties of blood and the IJaffur Shurreef, Custonms of the Ahessubnans of India, p. 217. 2 Doughty, Zoc. cit., vol. i, p. 54. 3von Kremer, Studien, part ii, p. 54; Lane, Arabian Society, pp. 42 sq. 4Lane, Arabian Society, p. 43. 5Idemr, Modern Egyptians, p. 237. 6 Ibid., p. 236; Burton, ill his translation of the Arabian Nights, vol. i, p. 10, niote 2.</page><page sequence="14">illustrated by thbe present beliefs of th,e Peolplc of Morocco. 265 practice of blood revenge." The 'imn usually appear to men in animal form, thouglh they cail also take the shape of mern. This last feature, however, cannot be regarded as constituting a fundamental distinction between them and ordinary animals in the miiind of the Arabs, who believed that there were whole tribes of men who had the power of assuming animal form. The supernatural powers of the #'inn do not differ from those which savages, in the totem stage, ascribe to wild beasts. They appear and disappear mysteriously, and are connected with super- natural voices and warnings, with unexplained sickness or death, just as totem animals are: they occasionally enter into friendly relations or even into marriages witli men, but animals do the same in the legends of savages: finally, a madman is possessed by the y"bsb, but there are a hundred exaluples of the soul of a beast being held to pass into a man. Like the wild beasts, the ghinn have, for the most part, no friendly or stated relationis with men, but are outside the pale of man's society: they frequent savage and deserted places far from the wonited tread of men, their special haunts being just those which wild beasts inost frequent. Ultimately, however, the only animals directly and constantly identified with the ginn are snakes and other noxious creeping things, which continue to haunt and molest mnen's habitations after wild beasts have been driveln out in the desert.. W0re shall see whether these statements are correct, and, if so, whether tlley have aily bearing oIl totemism. It is true that, among the g/inn, the individual has no distinct persoliality, and is only one of a group or a clan. It is also true that each kind of ainimal is often regarded by savages as analogous to a more or less organised cominunity, il which the individual is lost sight of. But the same holds good, to a great exteiit, for savage men. They form tribes or clans, and the imembers of each group are "united together by bonds of kinship and by the practice of the blood feud," whilst the members of the group are hardly taken into account at all as individuals. It is fromi this organization of human society that the idea of animal tribes is derived. Man has a tendency to anthropomorphism. He models nature after the fashion of his own nature. The Moors believe that all animals had a language in Sidna Sulejman's days. They also say that the horse prays to God when he stretches out his leg, and that the donkey which falls down asks God that the same should happen to its master. Now, as is well knowni, miian also attribuLtes human qualities to the supernatural beings in whose existence lie believes. He does so to gods, and he does so to demons. Why, then, should we believe that the similarity between the ginn-clans and the several species of aniimals is due to identity, instead of regarding it as the ilatural result of an analogous derivation from the comiimon root-idea of human society ? How closely the 4inn. imitate men, is shown by the fact that in countries where there are sultans or kings, as in Morocco and India, each nation of ginn also has its sultan or king. Professor Robertson Smith attaches much importance to the fact that the ginn most frequently appear to men in animal form. He does not deny that, according to Arab beliefs, they also may appear in the shape of human beings,- I Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites (1894), pp. 120, 126 sqq.</page><page sequence="15">266 EDWARD WESTERMARCK.-Y/It Nature oJ thte Arab 6imn, although he underrates the frequency of sulch cases,-but he thinks tllat he solves the diffictulty by a reference to the taldes of men who were transformed into animals. Such tales are met with in all Arab countries. The Moors say that the monkey was once a maii whom God changed into bis present shape because he performed his ablutions with iiilk, alnd that the storlk was a kadi, or judge, who was made a stork because he passed unjust sentenices upon his fellow-creatures. But such stories are not to the poinit Professor Robertson Smith gives no instalnce of aln animal assIumi1ing the shape of a man. Moreover, the ginn are also disease spirits. They are believed, both in Morocco and in Arabia, to cause disease by actually enitering into the man who is taken ill, a belief which mallifests itself very plainly in the practices of the exorcists, and I see no reasoll for not regardinog this belief as equally ancient and genuine as the rest. A totem animal, it is true, may also cause disease in a silmiilar way, but, so far as I know, only if it is eaten.' Savages know nothing of microbe totenis. It should be borne in mind that the ginn only incidenitally, never perinanently or necessarily, have the slhape of certain animals. One of their chief cbaracteristics is their extrenle changeability. They make themselves visible or invisible just as they like, change rapidly from one form into another, and, at their pleasure, take up their abode wherever they please. The totem, on the other hand, is a class of material objects, and a totem animal is esselntially an animal, though assumed to be endowed with solime mysterious power. Further, the animal totem is an animal species, and every member of it is a representative of the totem, whereas the ginn, when appearing in the shape of an animiial, does so only individually. There is absolutely no connection klnown between certain tribes of ginn and certain species of animals, nor is the whole animal species looked upon as ginn, although these at times assume the form of individual mnembers of it. Every dog, every cat, every tortoise is not supposed to be a spirit in disguise. Professor Robertson Smith maintains, ilndeed, that solme aniimal species, especially the lioni, were objects of actual worship among the Arabs,2 but Baron von Kremer, the learned Arabic scholar, lhas shown that this assertion has no foundation.3 The Moors avoid killing certain species. He who kills, and especially he who eats, a crow, they say, turns mad. They account it a sin to kill a stork, since the stork was once a judge. They maintain that he who kills a toad will get fever, or die, and they are afraid of destroying tortoises. They do not like to kill white spiders, because a white spider had once woven its web across the mouth of the cave where Muhammed was coilcealing himself from his enemies. These, when they came to the cave in their search, and saw the web, thought that no one could have recently entered it, and so passed it by without examining it, and the Prophet escaped. Many Moors do not eat white chickens, because they are the birds of Mulai 'Abd l-Kader, the great saint. Near the I Cf.

There may thus be various reasons for abstainiing from kil]ilg certaini kinds of animals, and onie reason is undoubtedly tlho belief that the animal mnight be a gian, which coul]d avencge tlle inijury inflictecl on it; but this does not inidicate previous toteniism. It is significant, alid it seemis almost strange, tllat ino closer coinnectioll exists between the ginn and particular allimal species than what is actually the case. So far as we know, tllere is only one kind of animal wllicll, according to anlcient Arab beliefs, permanently poEssesses a demoniacal nature, viz., tlle silake. "In every s4lake," says Wellhausell, " there is a spirit embodied, now a ialevolent, now a benevolent."' Muhainimed, wllilst conmandiiig hlis followers to kill tlle obnloxious snakes, expressly forbid themn to hurt those inllocuiouis ones wlliclh they fouiid in their houses.2 In modelrn Arabia., accordi]lg to Niebuhr, lhalmless snakes "take tlleir refuge in tlle walls of houses, andl are esteenied agreeable guests by the inhabitants."3 Thiere are also traces of velneratioll for houselhold snakes in Morocco, wlhere a snake wlhiell is seen in a house is frequently taken for a good giiin, the guardiall-spirit of the lhouse.4 The fact that the ancient Arabs regarded silakes as 'in.nb, hlowever, does not involve tllat the snakes were totem animnals. Animal worship is not the same as totemism. AMoreover, according to Nbldeke, no trace of actual worship of snakes is to be founld in ancielnt Arabia.5 The statelmlelnt that the special hlaulnts of yinna are the places most frequelited by wvild beasts, is certainlly liot in accordalice with facts. We have seelm that men are surrounided by gihan, that the yinn lhaunlt places wlhere no wild beasts ever go, evelm lhulmaan habitations, that every place lhas its owliers, its yiN)II, and tllat their prinlcipal abode is the under-world.

McLennan's Primitive Afarrifcqe, he was led to introduce too couifidently the (loctrine of Tote-mism as a leading factor on the religious side of ancient society, and(I he put forward the idea that the Arab beliefs as to the (Giinn were evidence of an early stage of Totemism among, the Semitic race. This view appeariug to Dr. Westermarck questionable, he collectecl during his residence and travel in Nortlh Africa the particulars as to the beliefs as to the C-Tinn prevailing there, wlhich are generalised in his paper read to-night. The result tells strongly against the identificatioln of the giun-belief with the totemii-belief. The collection of the anialogies alleged between the doctriue of g,inn-animals with the doctrine of totemii-aniimals shows, indeed, resemblances in the ideas of Arabs anid other peoples, as to the relation of animals to men, but the word totem ilndicates the importation of an extraneous elemient into the discussion, which would no doubt be bettei conducted iunder the headiing of animal worship. Independently of the questioni of totemism, the mnass of beliefs conneecte(d with the C-inn make us hope that Dr. Westermarek will use his opportunities to continue his researches in Morocco, and to follow up a line of research of wlhiclh he as yet only indicates the needc; namely, that of separating, the other native ideas of Morocco from the imported Moslem beliefs which extend from the Straits of Malacca to the Straits of Gibraltar. Wheni he points out that the n-iini are afraid of salt as well as of ironi, this is apparently to carry Arab tradition back to a saltless as well as an iroiiless antiquity. How they have retained old prejudices while attaching new imieanings to themn, seems to come into view, when it is notice(d that they object to wakino a sleeper, but not for the usual reason, and that they olbject to lookinig at themselves in a mirror, but seemningly have forgotten the alncient reason they doubtless had. Wheni Dr. Westermarck resumes his inquiries in North Africa, he may be able miiore or less to clear up the interesting( question which he has doubtless had often before him, how to distinguish and d elimilit the two ways in which men or demiions can appear anid behave as beasts. Is transformation of vGinn into cats or tortoises or snakes somethingo, related to transniigration of souls, or is it considered to take place by quite a different process ?</page></plain_text>
