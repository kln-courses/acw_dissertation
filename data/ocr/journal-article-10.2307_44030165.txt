<plain_text><page sequence="1">A comparison of Coetzee's Disgrace and Gowdy's The White Bone reveals that while it is possible to generate sym- pathy for animal being while resisting describing animal sentience in human terms, anthropomorphism can be a valuable and sophisticated strategy for depicting animal minds. A Defense of Anthropomorphism: Comparing Coetzee and Gowdy ONNO OERLEMANS The gulf that separates Man Friday from Batouala may he paralleled by the gulf that will separate Kipling's wolves from their literary descendants two hundred years hence, and we shall have animals who are neither symbolic, nor little men disguised, nor as four-legged tables moving, nor as painted scraps of paper that fly. It is one of the ways where science may enlarge the novel, by giving it fresh subject matter. - E.M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel The consciousness raises representation moral and in of epistemo- literature animal consciousness in literature raises moral and epistemo- logica! issues, many of which revolve around the problems posed by anthropomor- phism, the projection of the characteristics of human subjectivity onto animal sentience and behaviour. Animals are a nearly continual presence in most of our lives, and yet we feel ourselves severely restricted in our ability to know and understand them. It is thus natural that writers would include them as subjects in literature, but that they are at the same time wary of creating something unreal in developing animals as characters. Not representing animals at all robs them of their subjectivity and the influence they actu- ally have on our lives. At the other extreme, casting them as fully developed and seem- ingly human characters robs them of their difference from us and among one another. Mosaic 40/1 0027-1 276-07/ 18101 6$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">182 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) This is not a new dilemma and it is not isolated to literature. The OED notes that the original meaning of the word "anthropomorphism" refers to the error of casting God in human form, and it is not until the general development of biology as a science that the term has come to identify the danger and error of casting the "lower" animals in human form - especially of ascribing to them consciousness, emotion, and intelli- gence. Animals have, of course, been "humanized," inspirited, or deified since the very beginning of art (as cave paintings attest), so the contemporary interdiction against assuming aspects of mind and consciousness down (or across) species is especially striking, especially since Darwin himself assumed significant similarities between human and animal consciousness in his 1872 publication, Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. This resistance to anthropomorphism has held remarkable power especially within the field of ethology (the study of animal behaviour) until only the past decade or so, reaching its ascendancy in a mid-twentieth-century behaviourism that assumed that all animal behaviour could be explained without any reference to consciousness or even individuality (de Waal 54-61). The sentimentality and the sym- pathetic imagination involved with perceiving animals as intentional, emotional, intelligent, and even self-conscious have long been regarded by science has embar- rassing errors. Indeed, anthropomorphism has historically been connected with forms of embarrassment. Traditional animal fables embarrassed readers by revealing obvious human failures; such anthropomorphism also signals embarrassment for overt sym- bolism. Contemporary forms of anthropomorphism are frequently taken to suggest a lack of seriousness. It is what children do, or what we do for children. Talking animals are now primarily the realm of Disney, of easy sentiment and willed escape from the affairs of humans, or even of a barely suppressed misanthropy. In literature, as Ursula Le Guin rightly notes in the introduction to her collection of stories about talking animals, anthropomorphism has largely been relegated to writing for children, which is itself relegated to the realm of the un-serious (9). Our embarrassment signals that there is something suspect about taking animals seriously. Interestingly, Derrida takes up precisely this point in his late essay "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)." Here, he investigates the puzzle of feeling oneself naked before the gaze of a pet cat. The "question of the animal" as he puts it, is in part an acknowledgement of the moment of embarrassing personal exposure. But his question is profound: what does it mean to take the gaze of an animal seri- ously? Why should one feel naked before it? His embarrassment, perhaps familiar to many pet owners, is the product of a double-bind; in this specific moment we sup- pose both that the cat is a subject who can be said to have a gaze, who can size us up,</page><page sequence="3">Onno Oerlemans 183 as it were, and that it is a being who cannot recognize our nakedness, before whom we should not be embarrassed. We are embarrassed both for our nakedness, and for having over-stepped some boundary by projecting human awareness, even human taboos (of nakedness), onto the cat. The larger problem Derrida points to is in iden- tifying the animal as a version, perhaps the constitutive version, of the other. The human-animal binary is at the centre of our cultural history and presumably at or near the centre of our collective self-consciousness. Derrida argues that philosophy has grounded itself in part by defining the human against the animal: we are the only animal who is rational, tool-making, linguistic, spiritual, forward-seeing, conscious, and so on. Thus, imagining animal consciousness is dangerous because it can under- mine self-conceptions, especially of our sanctified place in the natural order of things. Imagining animal being is also pathetic or embarrassing because defining the human against the animal implies our own insufficiency. Contemporary ethology is now beginning to embrace the likelihood that human consciousness itself has evolved from pre-existing forms, as Darwin himself suggested - that animal brains contain their own extraordinary complexities and that many ani- mals other than humans possess degrees of intelligence and consciousness. This in turn has encouraged several ethologists to adopt anthropomorphism as a heuristic mode of investigating animal consciousness and representing their findings (Searle, Jamieson, Bekoff, de Waal). For such ethologists, terms normally reserved for features of human consciousness and behaviour may be used to describe and explain animal behaviour. They assume that such terms imply neither erroneous projection nor objective fact, but potential similarity. Indeed, these scientists argue that the interdiction against anthro- pomorphism is inherently speciesist, since it assumes that all qualities of mind we appear to perceive in animals are merely projections rather than similarities shared to differing degrees. Jamieson goes so far as to liken the behaviourist interdiction against anthropomorphism to a self-enforced perceptual disability, a willed suppression of per- ception and imagination on the part of the observer of animal behaviour (64). It is worth asking in the light of these changing scientific perceptions of anthropo- morphism, and growing acceptance of animal consciousness and individuality within ethology, how contemporary literature has reflected animal consciousness. Does an increasing interest in the animal, abetted not just by science, but also by our growing awareness of the precipitous decline of wild animals, allow for, and even encourage, writers to represent animal being, not as allegorical or symbolic of human being, nor as "an index of humanness" (Simons 64), nor merely as victims of human domina- tion ( Scholtmeijer, Animal Victims 11)?</page><page sequence="4">184 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) I think the answer to this question is a qualified "yes." Within contemporary fic- tion, at least, there does appear to be a developing trend toward new and serious rep- resentations of animals. Barbara Gowdy's The White Bone, Jane Smiley 's Horse Heaven, Paul Auster's Timbuktu, Seth Kantner's Ordinary Wolves, and Kim Echlin's Elephant Winter, for example, offer a range of concerted attempts at imagining animal subjectivity as rich and distinct, while J.M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals and Disgrace also draw extraordinary attention to the question of the animal. In the light of this new focus, it is worth examining precisely what is at stake in the literary representa- tion of animals. The goals of this essay are to show both that literature has special power to realize animal being, and that anthropomorphism - the figuring of animal sentience and behaviour in human terms - is inevitably a central issue. I wish to com- pare two works that show a distinct interest in animals but have radically different approaches to anthropomorphism: Gowdy's The White Bone and Coetzee's Disgrace. Both writers have impressive reputations independent of their interest in animal wel- fare, and their novels take virtually opposite positions towards representing animal being in human terms. Gowdy's novel is the most extreme and sustained example of anthropomorphism I have encountered, while Coetzee explicitly forswears it. In this comparison, I want to answer two specific questions: What are the risks and benefits of anthropomorphism for the serious novel? And to what degree can animal being be figured sympathetically without representations of animal subjectivity in characteris- tically human terms? Coetzee clearly is interested to my mind in animals one of and the their most welfare. important His cagey writers novella alive today. of essay-lectures He is also clearly interested in animals and their welfare. His cagey novella of essay-lectures in Elizabeth Costello (which incorporates the earlier essays of The Lives of Animals) suggests that he is also something of an activist in the sense that he draws explicit and sustained attention to the disturbing ways in which we treat domesticated animals. Though the arguments for animal welfare in that text are coy and mediated, they are motivated by a profound awareness of animal suffering, particularly in the livestock industry, which its protagonist compares to the Holocaust. Yet Coetzee is also unwill- ing to represent animal consciousness. In a rare interview featured in the animal rights magazine Satya, for instance, Coetzee says that: "The mode of consciousness of nonhuman species is quite different from human consciousness. There is a strong argument to be made that it is impossible for a human being to inhabit the con- sciousness of an animal, whereas through the faculty of sympathy (fellow-feeling) it is possible for one human being to know quite vividly what it is like to be someone else" (Interview).</page><page sequence="5">Onno Oerlemans 185 Coetzee's objections to representing animal subjectivity are much like those of behaviourist ethologists (like John S. Kennedy in The New Anthropomorphism) in his belief in the unbridgeable nature of the divide between human and non-human sen- tience, and his fear of projecting human attributes onto animals. In his novels, in which animals figure with increasing frequency, they are silent others, usually visibly suffering at the hands of humans. Though they are closely watched by the novels' pro- tagonists, they are largely inscrutable. In Waiting for the Barbarians , The Master of St. Petersburg , and most of all in Disgrace , animals are starved, shot, euthanized, trapped, and caged. They exist in the margins of his novels, at the horizon of their protagonists' gradually expanding moral awareness. To imagine or depict animal suffering requires only a minimal sense of their sentience, and reflects Bentham's dictum that it is an animal's ability to feel pain rather than its ability to reason or talk that dictates how we ought to treat them. For Elizabeth Costello, a richly ironic mouthpiece for Coetzee, animal suffering is the central fact she wishes her audience to acknowledge; she asserts that animals have "only their silence left with which to confront us" ( Elizabeth 70). She also argues against the importance of any substantive similarity between human and animal consciousness. "The question to ask should not be: Do we have something in common - reason, self-consciousness, a soul - with other animals," she asserts (77). "To thinking, cogitation, I oppose fullness, embodiedness, the sensation of being - not a consciousness of yourself as a kind of ghostly reasoning machine thinking thoughts, but on the contrary the sensation [. . .] of being a body with limbs that have extensions in space, of being alive to the world" (79). Though Costello also utters the un-Coetzeean sentiment that "there is no limit to the extent to which we can think ourselves into the being of another" (80) (such limits are a central theme of all his novels), her argument for compassion for animals assumes that they have a kind of base-level sentience. Contra Heidegger, Costello suggests that being in the world is defined not by consciousness or language, but by something more fundamentally rooted in the physical: of moving, interacting, perceiving, and feeling. This is the aspect of animal being that Costello celebrates, for instance, in highlighting the ani- mal poetry of Ted Hughes, which "is a matter [. . .] not of inhabiting another mind but of inhabiting another body" (96). The primary means by which Coetzee generates sympathy for the animal and produces a sense of our connection to it is through his pervasive and implicit decon- struction of the difference between animal and human. This deconstruction does not assert fundamental similarity of being (and in this Coetzee is similar to Derrida), so much as it dissolves notions of our own superiority and focuses attention on the value of individual being, on singular interiority. On the one hand, his novels undermine</page><page sequence="6">186 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) the illusion of power, freedom, and reason produced by our collective belief in human consciousness. That is, Coetzee resists reflecting animal consciousness and interiority because he is sceptical even about claims for human consciousness. His human char- acters mostly fail to know themselves and are almost entirely unable to know others with whom they desire some intimacy (like the magistrate in Waiting for the Barbarians, unable to understand his own motives and actions, or those of the barbarian woman he has sex with, or of his commander). Given this fundamental suspicion about our own consciousness, anthropomorphism is, for Coetzee, a mode of furthering an illu- sion about ourselves by projecting it onto other species. On the other hand, as Sam Durrant has noted, Coetzee s novels also argue that "to transcend the other's alterity is to efface that alterity, that the act of empathy is the attempt to imagine the other as the same, as another version of the self. Coetzee's novels insist on the difference of the other in order to explore the impossible task of relating to the other as other" (27). In Coetzee, animals also possess this distinct individuality of being, a meaning known only to the individual being itself. Like most Coetzee protagonists, David Lurie in Disgrace has remarkably little control over his life. He is in disgrace because of the sexual desire he appears compelled to act upon, that he in fact forces upon one of his students, and because of his refusal to apologize or atone for this act. In a moment of fine irony, a lecture on Wordsworth's Prelude is driven by his sexual desire for this young student as he attempts to impress her. (It's worth noting that over the course of the novel, Wordsworth - the poet of con- sciousness - is replaced by Byron - the poet of desire - as the symbolic Romantic.) Even as his self-deceptions fall away, and he realizes that his intercourse with Melanie "is undesired to the core," so that she must afterwards be "trying to cleanse herself of it, of him" (25), he does not or cannot stop. When he is beaten and burned by the young men who rape his own daughter, his first actions are based on the instinct to protect of his daughter. Later, when he sees one of the rapists alone, Lurie and the dog he is walking simultaneously attack him, Lurie calling him "a filthy swine" (206) as he does so, linking the three of them as animal figures. This scene points to something nearly paradigmatic in Coetzee's writing; for his characters, consciousness and its products can themselves become rationalizations or covers for more fundamental desires of the body, to satiate appetites and to avoid pain. That Lurie defends himself as having become "a servant of Eros" (52) reveals the primacy of desire even as he tries to personify it as something divine. For Coetzee's characters, actual motivations are dimly revealed in retrospect; the deepest motivations are animal - not base or debased, but primal and of the body - and are beyond the ability of language to artic- ulate. Like the animals of the novel, its human characters fear death and brutalization,</page><page sequence="7">Onno Oerlemans 187 seek out sex and comforting contact with others. As Lucy says to her father early in the novel, when she defends both her animal welfare friends and her own boarding of neg- lected animals, animals "are not going to lead me to a higher life, and the reason is, there is no higher Ufe. This is the only life there is. Which we share with the animals" (74). Yet, in this seeming debasement of human being, there appears also the discov- ery of some primal being or individuality. In Disgrace , this is revealed paradoxically in Lurie's refusal to apologize to the University administration for his sexual assault. He refuses to be externally compelled, to acknowledge that his desires were either wrong or controllable. We may find this shocking and immoral, but Lurie defends something like the most inviolable part of his self, which one might call animalistic. His desires define who he is, and an apology or denial of these desires is a betrayal of himself. He refuses to utter words of contrition because they would be false, an attempt by others to define his actions as governed by reason and free will. His defence is not of his actions, but of his identity and privacy. It is the sine qua non of being, which animals also share. The issue is not that the reader sympathizes with this point of view, merely that we are made aware of it. Indeed, Coetzee's narrators, like Lurie himself, are gen- erally indifferent to the sympathy of others, including the reader. If the novel begins with a depiction of its protagonist that brings him down to the level of the "animal," it develops in part with its protagonist's growing sympathy for animals. This is not a recognition of their consciousness, but rather of their embodiedness, their claim to existence and being. In the stripped-down life he finds in his daughter's tiny farm, he grows vaguely attached to the dogs she boards, and to the neighbour's sheep that are destined for slaughter. Most of all, he gains a powerful awareness of animal being in assisting the local vet in putting down unwanted and sick animals. There is nothing neat or obvious here; Lurie does not have a singular change of heart, nor does he become an animal rights activist. Rather, there is a repeated blurring of his understanding of animal and human, and an intensification of his feeling, his sympathy, for animals. For Lurie, humans are more like animals, and animals more like humans, than he had thought. Thus, for instance, he comes to think of the rape of his own daughter as the result of the general compulsion to produce offspring; "it was not the pleasure principle that ran the show but the testicles, sacs bulging with seed aching to perfect itself [. . .] meant to mark her, like a dog's urine" (199). He also comes to accept that he can smell animal fear and death, and that the dogs he helps put down can smell his shame. He takes over the role of disposing of the animal corpses rather than simply leaving them out for the trash because "he is not prepared to inflict such dishonour upon them" (144). Disgrace forces readers to think through human and animal difference, to expe- rience slippages in our categorization of human and animal. This is nowhere more</page><page sequence="8">188 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) obvious than in the novel's tour deforce conclusion, which ends no particular narra- tive thread, but instead draws stark attention to the theme of human-animal relations. Lurie is now working full-time at the animal clinic, cleaning, feeding and occasionally talking to the animals there, while he half-heartedly composes music for his opera about Byron and Theresa. He is befriended by a young dog "with a withered left hindquarter" who has no chance of being adopted, and who seems to be drawn by Lurie's banjo play- ing. Lurie himself "is sensible of a generous affection streaming out toward him from the dog" (215) and even imagines including a howling dog in his opera. ("Surely in a work that will never be performed, all things are permitted," he muses, reminding us of the relative freedom to be found in art [215].) Pondering his duties to the dog, Lurie knows that the dog will happily follow him into the surgery, but what the dog will not be able to work out, [. . ģ] is how one can enter what seems to be an ordinary room and never come out again. Something happens in this room, something unmentionable: here the soul is yanked out of the body; briefly it hangs about in the air, twisting and contorting; then it is sucked away and is gone. It will be beyond him, this room that is not a room but a hole where one leaks out of existence.! . . .] He can save the young dog, if he wishes, for another week. But a time must come, it can- not be evaded, when he will have to bring him to Bev Shaw in her operating room (perhaps he will carry him in his arms, perhaps he will do that for him) and caress him and brush back the fur so that the needle can find the vein, and whisper to him and support him in the moment when, bewilderingly, his legs buckle; and then, when the soul is out, fold him up and pack him away in his bag, and the next day wheel the bag into the flames and see that it is burnt, burnt up. He will do all that for him when his time comes. It will be little enough, less than little: nothing (219-20). The novel ends a few short paragraphs later, with Lurie acknowledging that he will "give him up" on this day, even as he has just imagined it as a kind of murder ("the soul is yanked out of the body"). On the one hand, this act, and the description of it, seem brutally cruel, lingering in the future tense on the details of killing a dog whose innocence and joy (a word Elizabeth Costello uses to describe animal being) have just been extolled. "The dog wags its crippled rear, sniffs his face, licks his cheeks, his lips, his ears" when Lurie calls him into the surgery to be killed. The scene runs the risk of caricature, a Swiftean parody of the implied sentimental ending in which Lurie is befriended by a crippled dog whom he then saves from extermination. Though the scene appears calculated to shock readers out of a sense that Lurie might finally be saved, it is thematically consonant with the rest of the novel's depiction of animals. The shock of emotion it produces forces us to acknowledge the reality of animal</page><page sequence="9">Onno Oerlemans 189 being, which Lurie refers to as "soul." Indeed, Lurie s moral progress in the novel is marked not by his failed chance to save the animal, but by his ability to "concentrate all his attention on the animal they are killing," an awareness he calls a kind of "love" (219). This love and the killing of the dog brilliantly mark how far the novel will go towards the animal. Sympathy for the animal is most intense at the moment of the animal's disappearance, even as the novel concludes by displacing human tragedies with those of actual animals. Coeztee compels readers to confront animality within ourselves and at the mar- gins of our perceptions. Animals remain as enigmas demanding some kind of response, neatly symbolized by Lurie killing an animal he loves. Graham Huggan, cit- ing Steve Baker, argues that Coetzee maintains a tension between "animal-endorsing" and "animal-sceptical" modes of representation. In Disgrace, however, Coetzee reflects the latter mode, which is "sceptical not of animals themselves (as if the very existence of nonhuman life was in question), but rather of culture's means of constructing and classifying the animal in order to make it meaningful to the human" (Baker 9). The question becomes, to borrow from Frost, what to make of such a diminished thing? Is Coetzee's scepticism about the ability to access and represent the truth of animal being itself a virtue? What does it mean for fiction to so circumscribe imaginative sympathy at the species boundary, even if as a sign of respect? One answer, I think, is that with the tension tilted in this way, the animal must remain in the margins of attention, as a problem. It remains profoundly other, even if we can discover that oth- erness within ourselves. For Coetzee, the question of the animal foregrounds the problem of representation itself, and so, in a sense, animals themselves remain instru- mental. Lurie's refusal to save the crippled dog stands not just for his own continued state of disgrace, but also for Coetzee's refusal to enter the mind of the animal. While, sceptic as also Huggans exists in suggests, Gowdy's the The tension White between Bone, it does animal-endorsing so with the emphasis and animal- clearly sceptic also exists in Gowdy's The White Bone, it does so with the emphasis clearly on the former pole. The novel draws explicit attention to the dire situation of ele- phants in Africa, describing the horror of poaching, habitat loss, and drought. It describes the pressures on elephant populations, and graphically illustrates their decline. And the novel works to create sympathy in its readers for elephants by fully imagining individual animal lives. Gowdy describes their behaviour in great detail, based on her reading of several books on elephant behaviour by noted field ecologists and ethologists (whom Gowdy identifies in a postscript), and her own observations of them in Kenya. As well, Gowdy's omniscient narrator fully enters the minds of these animals. Her elephants have thoughts, desires, personalities, and extraordinary</page><page sequence="10">190 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) memories. More fabulous still, their complex communications (including telepathy) are rendered in English. They sing and pray, have visions and produce art. They read minds, have second sight, give voice to complex religious belief, and even, some of them, shine green light out of their eyes. The novel displays an extraordinary range of representations of elephant life, from the plausible to the fantastic. Reading Gowdy after Coetzee, one feels that one could not be further afield. The novel's mix of realistic accounts of elephant behaviour, physiology, and habi- tat with extreme anthropomorphism and fantasy poses special challenges for readers. On the one hand, this mix works to create sympathy for actual elephants, and so the novel can be read as an attempt to reveal the horrors of butchering complex conscious beings. On the other hand, its range of anthropomorphism can strain credulity to such a degree that it undermines the novel's seemingly serious ambitions about envi- ronmental ethics and animal consciousness. At some point in the novel (and it will happen much earlier for some than for others), every reader will be embarrassed by it. That is, one is made to feel that the author has gone too far, and we are confused, uncomfortable, even a little ashamed perhaps, for having followed her there. It is in part the embarrassment of recognizing ill-fitting genres: the eco-drama becomes a quasi-religious vision quest, or even a morality tale. The self-conscious awareness that comes with this embarrassment, I want to argue, is in fact crucial to the deeper under- standing of anthropomorphism (as the imagining of animal consciousness) that is at the centre of the novel. There are three broad categories of anthropomorphism in The White Bone: the realistic (scientific), based on actual observation; the plausibly hypothetical (conjec- tures reasonably based on current knowledge); and the implausible and fantastical, which ultimately define the limits of anthropomorphism. The first category includes the descriptions of elephant behaviour rather than consciousness, and these details are crucial to grounding the novel in reality. Like the elephants studied by researchers such as Cynthia Moss, Delia and Mark Owens, and Joyce Poole, the elephants of the novel travel in matriarchal groups and communicate with trumpeting sounds, moans, whines, and infrasonic calls. They seek out, fondle and mourn the skeletal remains of dead elephants. They dig for and find water. Male elephants wander alone or in small groups in the desert. They gather warily around water holes, knowing that it is here that they are most likely to be attacked by predators and humans. Mother elephants are extremely attentive to their calves, nursing and raising them for over a decade. The elephants behave as though they have distinct personalities, which has been well-documented by Cynthia Moss (Elephant Memories), and is in any case a phenomenon found in many species. The young clearly learn from the matriarchal</page><page sequence="11">Onno Oerlemans 191 group they belong to, and different groups appear to have different cultures; that is, they communicate and behave somewhat differently than other groups. Most of the elephants are brutally killed by poachers, and only one dies of old age ("nine out of ten are slaughtered in their prime, decades before their memories have started to drain," we are told in the novels second paragraph.). Adolescent males leave the matriarchal group, and periodically return to attempt to copulate with a willing female. Since these details are about documented behaviour, they are anthropomorphic only to the degree in which they are supposed to reflect intentionality. The behaviours suggest rather than prove the existence of distinct animal consciousness. However, most of these details of elephant behaviour are reflected in the novel through the thoughts and words that Gowdy's narrator gives the elephants themselves. There is a clear leap from these behaviours, some of which assume or reflect the idea of complex animal consciousness, to the full imagining of that consciousness. But this leap is to some degree grounded in established science - not just observations of elephant behaviour, but also understandings of brain complexity - and thus much of the nature of this consciousness falls into the second category of anthropomorphism, the plausi- bly hypothetical. Perhaps the most startling fact about elephants is that they have the largest brain of any land animal; the brain of an adult elephant weighs around five kilo- grams, or about four times that of an adult human. Like humans, elephant brains increase about threefold in size from childhood to adulthood, suggesting extraordinary learning and development. The natural lifespan and sexual development of elephants also closely matches that of humans; these fundamental similarities indeed suggest one of the reasons Gowdy chose elephants: imagining that elephants are like humans is in the first place grounded on actual resemblances. A central premise of Gowdy's novel, introduced in the prologue, is that elephants have memories commensurate with their size. One of the novel's subtle pleasures, and indeed one of the implications of its anthropomorphism, is that elephant conscious- ness is different from ours, not simply because elephants exhibit different behaviour (they fondly smell each other's genitalia and waste), but because they take in the world differently, and above all, remember it far more profoundly. Indeed, those aspects of elephant behaviour and consciousness that do not appear human are not anthropo- morphic, strictly understood. However, they remain anthropomorphic in the sense that, to rigid behaviourists, the very phenomenon of consciousness is reserved for humans, and even the non-human attributes Gowdy ascribes to elephant conscious- ness require imagining or projecting of the narrator/author. Thus Gowdy imagines that because elephants have billions more neurons than our brains, they must have better memories, and so the narrator says in the prologue that "Every odour they have</page><page sequence="12">192 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) ever sucked into their trunks, every flicker of sunlight they have ever doused with their tremendous shadows is preserved inside them as a perfect and instantly retriev- able moment"(l). So too, they "see better than you may imagine," (2) since, as Gowdy acutely notes, a crucial aspect of perception is the continual and necessary priming of our awareness of the present by what we remember about the world around us. Included in what I've been calling the second category of anthropomorphism, the plausible but speculative and imagined, is elephant communication, which forms the bulk of the actual text. The novel's elephants articulate complex ideas not just about the behaviours just listed, but also about the process of naming each other, escaping humans, negotiating with a cheetah about the location of a mystical safe place that is part of their lore, and about the nature of their God, to name just a few. But elephant communication rendered in English is itself a trope, an accommodation of whatever actual elephant language might be, and if we accept the reality of the complexity of elephant behaviour and brain, it seems unimaginable that they do not somehow communicate. In the novel the elephants are said to "trumpet" their com- munication, or to nudge, flap ears, roar, rumble, groan, sing, bellow, murmur, gasp, or growl. When they are far apart, they send signals ultrasonically, which they "hear" through their feet. Moreover, like the novel's curiously hybrid narrator (who is explic- itly figured in the novel's preface footnotes as translating the elephant into the human, and vice versa), the elephants too are self-conscious about the struggle of communi- cating, particularly Date Bed, the main group's "mind-talker," and Tall Time, its quest- ing hero. They wonder about and question their ability to interpret signs from each other, from the landscape around them, and, most intriguingly, from other animals. How could they or any animal survive, the novel makes us wonder, if they did not read each other and the world around them? Date Bed imagines and attempts an act of interspecies "mind-reading," as she calls it, that is analogous to what Gowdy herself is doing in imagining and represent- ing animal consciousness and communication. At this point in the novel, Date Bed has a bullet in her skull, is disoriented by the heat, and is falling in and out of con- sciousness. She stares at a group of green flies, swarming over her dung, and though "mind talkers and insects don't communicate," she determines that these flies vainly call themselves "vital." All the flies rise up and settle back down on the bolus closest to her right eye, and she has the feeling that the entirety of her is too much for them to grasp and that they suppose her eye to be a creature all on its own whom they call the Shine. What is curious is that while it is her mind that is forming this narrative, she is dependent upon the buzzing for inspi- ration. She hears no words. She hears an oscillation that seems to enter the hole in her head and within that cavity make itself intelligible to her. (Ill)</page><page sequence="13">Onno Oerlemans 193 This passage suggests a parody of anthropomorphism, of reading animal behaviour and crossing species boundaries, which, in this instance at least, appears to be the result of brain damage. The vanity Date Bed refers to is also her own in imagining that she can transform the inarticulate buzzing of flies into something meaningful. She is creating the intentions and even the consciousness of the beings she intensely observes. (Like humans regarding other animals, she also assumes a massive superi- ority over them.) She's even creating the creature, since she imagines the group of flies form a single being. Yet she is "dependent on the buzzing," as presumably Gowdy is dependent on her own observation of elephants - their sounds and signs - to form the narrative she creates. She believes, as many scientists do, as many of us do with our own pets, that she can in some way read the minds of the creatures she is in some way creating. They are productions of the imagination, obviously, but they are grounded in the real world; they are not merely or purely figments of the imagination. Their gaze at her - like that of Derrida's cat - strongly suggests a real, if unknowable, other. This example clearly reveals how all anthropomorphism must to some degree be fic- tion, and why it can be parodied even as it is advanced as a serious product of the imagination. It necessarily involves a process of accommodation, of giving voice, which yet also desires to remain a form of mimesis, reflecting something real about the world beyond our own interiority. The paradox of drawing attention to the process of creating consciousness is that it appears to naturalize it; imagining or projecting consciousness onto other animals is itself an almost instinctive desire of our own consciousness, as it is of Date Bed's. Recognizing it as instinctive perhaps also makes us less embarrassed by it. Making the process of accommodation explicit, Gowdy works to suspend (and invite) readers' dis- belief in reading, imagining, and depicting the consciousness of elephants. This sus- pension is crucial to any fiction, of course, but more so when it directly engages a topic likely to produce strong resistance in at least some readers, and that has the relatively explicit goal of winning broader sympathy for the current plight of African elephants. Such suspension encourages readers to embrace the reality of elephant being, and thus implicitly to its value, its right to exist. If the novel "works," that is, if it is able to sus- pend the disbelief of readers, then it directly enhances the reader's moral sympathy for animals by revealing a seemingly real world that we do not belong to. It shows too the special power of literary discourse in crossing and blurring species boundaries. Another effect of the novel's first and second categories of anthropomorphism is to provide us a perspective in which human being is made to seem other, an exercise in species humility. Humans do not appear often in the novel, but when they do, they are either brutal (slaughtering elephants with automatic rifles, and then chain sawing</page><page sequence="14">194 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) off heads, faces, and tusks), or bizarre, as when they stare blandly, from a distance, at the elephants; "If humans feel emotions," Mud thinks, "she would say that this one feels amusement" (317). Mostly, the elephants associate humans with mindless bru- tality, which is accurate enough, since we are the only species who routinely kill them. The third kind of anthropomorphism in the novel consists of features of elephant consciousness that seem wildly implausible and utterly unknowable, clearly not grounded in any recognized fact, observation, or obvious form of accommodation. They are instead explicitly imagined, projected, and fictional. Many of these features reflect a complex culture, a shared knowledge of the world, a phenomenon until recently thought to belong only to humans. In the novel, the elephants have complex names and naming rituals, and discuss epistemological questions. Mud and Date Bed both think about the nature of her memory, and its relationship to knowledge. "Knowing things is only a dream of having known them," she thinks (37). Tall Time is a master of finding portentous signs in the world around him, but is shaken by the pos- sibility that they might be infinite. More fantastic (though still in the realm, perhaps, of human desire), many elephants in the novel also have visions; they see the future; a few are capable of telepathically communicating to other elephants and animals. Perhaps most surprisingly, the elephants' larger culture includes elaborate religious belief, not just a God, whom they call "the She," but also of heaven, an afterlife, a cre- ation myth, and (ironically) the existence of evil in the form of humans, whom they understand as fallen elephants, deformed and devolved because of their carnivorism (which is understood as a kind of cannibalism). Gowdy's elephants also create and recite elaborate poems, sing hymns, and apparently produce and interpret cave draw- ings. Indeed, the central plot of the novel is a quest for the white bone, which is a sacred talisman capable of guiding elephants to the Safe Place. And most fantastical, a group of forest elephants known as the Lost Ones have eyes "so brilliant that they produce funnels of light, casting upon the precipitous slope a swampy luminescence" (216), which is a characteristic of some deep sea fish, and not, of course, humans. What are we to make of these characterizations of elephant being? Marian Scholtmeijer argues that the novel's representation of elephant religion makes the novel "a touch ludicrous" ("Animals" 391). I would go further and say that the novel sets out not just to suspend disbelief, as I've already demonstrated, but also to provoke it, which this third category of fantastical anthropomorphism clearly does. If a reader begins the novel with little or no interest in elephant consciousness, there is much in the novel that works to produce it. If a reader begins the novel with pre-existing sym- pathy or belief in animal consciousness then there are almost certainly moments which will provoke disbelief, even scorn, which risks undermining whatever sympathy the</page><page sequence="15">Onno Oerlemans 195 novel has worked to develop. It is this mix of sympathy and incredulity that poses the greatest challenge for the novels readers. Such moments highlight the intrinsic embarrassment of the anthropomorphic act itself, refusing to let us forget, for one thing, that we are uncomfortable moving beyond species borders, or that the dis- course and history of anthropomorphism contain within it an extraordinary com- mitment to a fixed hierarchy among species, a chain of being historically anchored in the divine. More profoundly, the novel's embarrassments force readers to recognize the limits of our belief about other animals, to draw and redraw the boundary between human and other animal species, and individual animals. This process goes some way toward deconstructing the very concept of anthropomorphism, forcing us to question which aspects of being and consciousness are, after all, purely human. All acts of mind-reading, of recreating the consciousness of others, involve received wisdom and faith on the one hand, and inquiry and speculation on the other. We can never know what it is like to be a bat, the philosopher Thomas Nagel has famously argued, but many of us, scientists included, feel we can make some basic steps towards understanding consciousness not like our own, and above all, accept its exis- tence. All such acts, even imagining the consciousness of another person, require us to read signs, the expressions, behaviours, brain structures, etc., of other animals, and to make imaginative leaps. The novel's perhaps parodie reflection of religious faith, of the Lost Ones' bizarre vision, and even Date Bed's reading of insect minds, on the one hand force us to acknowledge that what we are reading is fiction and fantasy. These are not after all real elephants. On the other hand, elephant religion in the novel also reminds us that human religion depends on our seemingly natural inclination to imagine and project consciousness beyond our own. We understand God as an omnis- cient consciousness, and our ability to create or discover this ultimate consciousness is a mark of the power of our own. Cultural interdictions against anthropomorphism reveal extraordinary hubris; we may perceive or imagine similitude up the supposed chain of being (or hierarchy of species), but not down. By attributing religious faith to her elephants, Gowdy reveals and undermines this deeply historic taboo, encouraging us to seek consciousness where it is likely to exist, in sentient creatures much like our- selves. The novel can make us believe in the possibility that animals like elephants have complex emotional and spiritual lives, and equally, make us aware of all that we do not and cannot know about these lives, that they are rich beyond our imagining.</page><page sequence="16">196 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007 ) WORKS CITED Baker, Steve.
