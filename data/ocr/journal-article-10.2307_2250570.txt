<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and Ethics. By C. It. WADDINGTON AND OTHERS. London' G. Allen &amp; .Unwin, 1942. Pp. 144. 7s. 6d. THE first 11 pages are an essay by Dr. Waddington, the next 36 pages are comments by thirteen authors with replies by Dr. Waddington, the next 38 pages, entitled "Some psychological considerations ", are by Dr. Karin Stephen, Mrs. Klein, Miss Roths- child and Dr. Waddington, the next 10 pages are a correspondence between Professor Dingle and Dr. Waddington, the next 12 pages, entitled a Marxist critique, contain Professor Bernal's criticism and Dr. Waddington's reply, the next 15 pages contain final comments by the Bishop of Birmingham, the Dean of St. Paul's, Professor Chauncey D. Leake and Dr. Waddington. Finally, there are some notes on the contributors and an index. Dr. Waddington has three purposes' (1) to contend that ethical statements, such as "You oughtn't to kill ", are empirical general- izations like "You oughtn't to take less than 7 rag. of vitamin C daily "; (2) to emphasize and increase our grasp of the connexion between ethics and psycho-analysis; (3) to contend that "in the world as a Whole, the real good cannot be other than that which</page><page sequence="2">276 CRITICAL NOTICES: has been effective, namely that which has been exemplified in the course of evolution " (p. 18). (1) In saying that ethical statements are statements and state- ments of scientific fact Dr. Waddington opposes, first, those who say that ethical statements are exclamations and/or exhortations, and second, those who say That they are self-evident truths stating a necessary synthetic connexion between, on the one hand, such things as cruelty, content, and exhilaration, and on the other hand, goodness and badness, which are detected by a moral sense or in- tuition. He less explicitly opposes the latter because, finding it impossible to produce a formal definition of goodness in terms of naturalistic characters, he cannot venture to say definitely. that the good or evil of a state of affairs is a matter of what that state of affairs is and of how we feel and shall feel towards it. This com- bination of a transcendental ethical ontology with his positivistic epistemology work havoc. (See Broad's notes on the symposium between Waddington and Ewing, Proc. Aris. Soc., 28 May, 1942.) I shall assume that if Waddington had been acquainted with recent work on how one thing may be a matter of other things without being formally definable in terms of them then he would have constantly said what he sometimes finds himself obliged to say, namely, that goodness is a matter of natural characters. Though less dogmatic than Professor Bernal in his little sermon (p. 114) Dr. Waddington is almost equally innocent. To deal with the intuitionist doctrine of ethics it is necessary not only to make ,fun of it but also to remove the difficulties and admit the limitations of positivistic accounts. Dr. Waddington in rejecting the rhetorical doctrine and the analytic doctrine (Dr. Karin Stephen, p. 79, lines 8 and 9) makes this impossible. Yet Sidgwick, Moore and others cannot be ignored. No doubt their thinking, like that of poor Broad, is vitiated by the fact that their " concepts are non-develop- mental " (p. 51) or are " anthropomorphic abstractions such as Will, Conscience or Desire" (Bernal, p. 120). It would be kind, however, to explain a little how it is vitiated so that those of us who are still so anthropomorphic about men may the sooner go to where we are going, or should I say, the sooner reach that realistic ethos and superior social environment towards which the dynamic processes of evolutionary change are even now inevitably conduct- ing us. If someone says of a baby, " He's his father to a T ", while another says, " No, no, he's his mother all over ", then one expects to find each right in some ways and to find that some of the ways in which the one is right make the other that far wrong, and that anyway the baby is quite a lot just like himself and not like his parents. It is the same when someone tells me that a giant panda is just a little bear while another says, "No, he just a big guinea pig ", while a third says, " No, he isn't anything but himself, the living essence of all cuddly toys ". What makes one think well or ill of</page><page sequence="3">C. H. WADDINGTON AND OTHERS, Science and Ethics. 277 these paradoxes, hyperboles, exaggerations, simplifications, is an intricate tale. Certainly, it isn't only a matter of the degree of likeness between the things concerned. Even if the baby is much more like his father than his mother, if the likeness to the mother can be revealed to me by suitable talk then I may think better of " No, it's his mother he's so like ", just because this likeness doesn't leap to the eye but is subtle and profound. " Ethical statements aren't statements but are commands, ex- hortations, exclamations "1 is false but profound and, till recently, novel, though strongly hinted at by Hume. " Ethical statements are statements, statements of fact " is of course true. They are statements of fact about what is good and right, i.e. about ethical fact. And mathematical statements are statements about mathe- matical fact. And both sorts of fact can be discovered. But to say all this is platitudinous and useless except in opposition, i.e. as corrective to falsehoods such as, "' They are exclamations ". For, as always in metaphysics, the difficulty lies within the expres: sions ' statement', ' fact', ' true ', ' false ',,' discover '.2 It is not for nothing that we use the same words ifn ethical and asthetic ,and mathematical procedure as we use in scientific procedure. But " Ethical statements are statements " is a platitude and reveals nothing, for it reminds us only of a likeness our notation already emphasizes. It can be useful only in opposition to a paradox, i.e. in the way " A man is a man and neitheir a monk nor a monkey" (with apologies to Forster) is useful. In contrast to this, "Ethical statements are statements of scientific fact, and in particular of psychological fact " is not a platitude and boring, but false and though not novel can still be illuminating if followed up in a novel way. I don't feel that we can say that Dr. Waddington does this, but he does make a sug- gestion as to how it could be done. (2) Dr. Wadcdington is anxious to increase our grasp of and emphasize the connexion between ethics and psycho-analysis. It is the speaking out of this idea and the help which Dr. Stephen and Mrs. Klein give him in doing so which make this little book worth something, so it seems to me. The idea is still new though it has been put forward before to some extent, e.g. by H. V. Dicks when in Clinical Studies in Psychopathology (p. 109) he writes, " Clearly the union of the opposites has been set as the highest goal of human achievement . . . a task to be fulfilled by the individual within himself-a process of psychological growth and unification-the resolution of conflict, to give it its modern name. The discovery of oneself, the finding of the centre from which we cannot err, of the 'still, small voice' of the ' Golden Flower', . . . of the thousand- 'See " Ethical Words and Ethical Facts ", Duncan-Jones, MIND, 1933. 2 We can all remember those 0 so valid, proofs that mathematical state- ments aren't commands nor rules of grammar because it is true that 375 X 2 equals 750 while neither commands nor rules can be true.</page><page sequence="4">278 CRITICAL NOTICES: petalled lotus, etc., etc., by whatever name this precioMs self- realization and acceptance has been called-this is nothing less than the aim of psychotherapy, within the limits of the patient's powers." This seems to me to be in a certain very important respect a better account of the connexion between ethics and analysis than Dr. Waddington's. On page 10 he writes, " the psycho-analytical discoveries, which are concerned with the development of the ethical systems of individuals, are the most profitable basis from which to begin an examination of the scientific basis of ethics ". This suggests that psycho-analysts discover generalizations and that then from these ethics may be deduced.' This misrepresents the psycho- analyst who, like a mechanic or a teacher of dancing, is as much an artist as a scientist. And also it is the discoveries in analysis by the analysed rather than the discoveries from analysis by the analyst that are most importantly connected with ethics. And, finally, the " discoveries " in analysis like discoveries of beauty in pictures or music are as much alterations in oneself and one's object as discoveries. An account such as Dicks' suggests how a man in the course of analysis may suddenly say to himself, " Why, this is ethics. I have been reading about it all my life, and sometimes when a difficult decision has been called for I have been forced to do ethics, but often the decision has been a matter of having to act one way or another-not a settling of things in myself." Of course working through an analysis is not doing ethics. But just as besides doing logic in the sense of setting out logical rules there is logical practice from which the rules are extracted as mne- monics, so besides ethics there is ethical practice from which, much less successfully, ethical rules can be extracted if that kind of thing amuses you. Now it is not so wrong to say that part of analysis is ethical practice. By " logical practice " I mean estimating the value of arguments, offering and accepting arguments and sifting our reactions to arguments. By " ethical practice " I mean accept- ing and refusing persons, acts and feelings, and the sifting of those acceptances and refusals. I mean the asking and answering of such questions as, " Is Jack such a blackguard ? ", " Ought I to have done that ? ", " Is it horrible of me to feel like I do when . . . ? " This is what Hume called, significantly, our decisions of praise or blame.2 But even if we say that it is this which is done in analysis we shall still be apt to mislead. For just as in deciding whether a picture is good and even in deciding whether a show is funny we don't merely look again at the picture and sift our reaction to it but also count the reactions of others, especially Clive Bell, so in deciding Whether it would be right to do so and so and whether it was right 'Another different but still intellectualistic bias is to be seen in Professor Stebbing's Ideals and Illusions. 2 The Enquiry, Appendix A.</page><page sequence="5">C. H. WADDINGTON AND OTHERS, Science and Ethics. 279 to do so and so we count the reactions of others. If, say what we will and say what they will, they differ from us still, then we say either that they use words differently or, in different circumstances, that though it is funny to us, or lovely to us, it isn't to them. And but for the extra regularity of nature in the matter of sweetness and redness and hotness and roundness we should do the same for them and say, " It's red to us but not to others ", or " It's sweet to children but not to adults ". And just as the redness, the real objective redness, of a red flag is a matter of its redness to nearly everybody to-day and also to-morrow unless it's been dipped in ink so is the beauty of a face, the niceness of a person, and the rightness of an act, a matter not only of how they seem to oneself but also of how they seem to others, and not only now but also when the bands stop playing. To sum up in jargon: Real redness is constructed from redness to A and redness to B and redness to C and, etc. And redness to A is constructed from seeming now red to A, still seeming, e.g. on closer inspection, red to A. Likewise satisfa,ctoriness is constructed from satisfactoriness to A, to B, to C. And really satisfactory to A is constructed from seems satisfactory to A, still seems satis- factory to A after listening to it again, or even now that he is sober, or, etc. Likewise rightness is constructed from really seems right to A, to B, etc., and really seems right to A is constructed from seems right to A at first blush, still seems right to A after review, comparison, etc. It is with the business of the transition from " seems for the moment acceptable and right to A " to cc seems really right and acceptable to A " that occurs in analysis. .1 remember how after I had been going to an analyst for about a month I was walking home and thinking over the sort of thing I had been doing and I said with surprise, " Why, this is ethics ". It was because what I had been doing struck me as being just more of the sort of thing I should call thinking a thing over to see whether it seems right to me, whether I can "accept myself" ifI do it. And yet what I had been doing could also be described as going into how I felt towards doing this with those consequences or that with those other consequences. To say that right is a matter of what at infinity still seems right to everybody and that what seems right to so and so is a matter of what he finally feels, is not to make right more subjective than red or round-(though it is more subjective). But it is a naturalistic and anti-transcendental metaphysic of ethics, i.e. ultimate description of ethical activity. It is opposed to the type of talk in, e.g. Principia Ethica, which suggests that goodness is related to those natural characters which make a thing good and our feelings to them like the power of a horse is related to those structural characters which cause that power and our feelings to them. The naturalistic type of talk suggests that on the contrary goodness is related to stopping on the way from Damascus 1 and 1 Karin Stephen, p. 79.</page><page sequence="6">280 CRITICAL NOTICES: cups of water and so on and our reactions to these, like the grace of a dancer to her movements and our feelings for these. Her grace is a matter of the patterns she gives to our eyes and the lift she gives to our hearts. So there is no problem of how we know she's graceful. All this isn't new. Mill said that the desirable is the desired and he didn't mean all the nonsense he's been said to mean. He didn't mean that the desirable is what happens to be consciously desired at the moment. He meant that it is what is really desired. What is really desired is what is desired when all our inclinations towards it are faced and not some ignored, including desires not to have a desire for such a thing; in other words, our desire for X is a real desire when all our desires for all that is for us in X have been " owned " and " sifted ". What does this mean ? In ethical effort people take note of the voice or prick of con- science-of the immediate response, "0 no, mustn't do that ". But they do not always take this as final. They say, " But there's no harm in it really, it's only my puritanical conscience ", and a small Dionysian voice grows louder, " It's,foolish, but it's fun ". They join in the frolic of the Restoration. And then they turn again and say, " The Puritans had something after all ", and take to driving in a victoria roun'd Balmoral-only to leave it for a faster car and the dancing 'twenties and so on. Oscillation in deciding between philosophical doctrines goes hopelessly on until one gives up suppressing conflicting voices and lets them all speak their fill. Only then can we modify and reconcile them. It is so with other things. The sifting of one's reaction towards doing such and such a thing having such and such consequences is like the sifting of one's re- action to a picture or an argument, or one's reaction (non-ethical) to a person. Professor Joad recently said to me, " How much of our reaction to these pictures is nostalgia for France? " and again one may say, " How much of my reaction to that man's argument was rhetoricql or due to flattery, how much logical ? " In this way one may say, cc How much of my reaction 'against a ' blind' on a Saturday night is due to my puritanical upbringing ", or " How much is it due to my father's being such a drunken misery- maker every Saturday night ". And saying this alters the reaction. True, one says, "I thought I disapproved a Saturday ' blind' but I didn't really ", but one might equally well say " I used to dis- approve a Saturday ' blind' until I connected my reaction to Bill's ' blind' to-night with my reaction to all father's ' blinds' when I was three ". And there is much in analysis which isn't different in kind from this. It is still connecting. It is more extensive and it is finding, grasping, how much the past is hidden in the present. And this is best done not so much with what Proust calls the " intel- lectual memory " which he says " preserves nothing of the past itself ", but in the way in which he found hidden in a madeleine and a cup of tea all those Sunday mornings and the streets and</page><page sequence="7">C. H.

It wasn't dugouts that River's patient feared, or, if you like, it was dugouts, only in them was hidden for him that frightening and shameful moment when having just pawned the watch his mother and father had given him he found himself caught in a narrow passage by that figure of vengeance, a big, silent dog, straight from the landscapes of the surrealists. Though it is especially the past it is not only the past that is hidden in a reaction to this or that now. " Her voice is in the falling rain " even if she is still alive and even present. In a different way the future comes in too. "Unborn To-morrow and dead Yesterday, Who cares about them if To-day be sweet?" The question would not have been asked if the answer hadn't been " Everybody ". Nor would it have been asked had not everybody sometimes wished the answer to be " Nobody ". Is it that to get a real response to the present we need something that will "clear to-day of past regrets and future fears " ? " In vino veritas" they say. "But the pubs mostly close at 10. Besides though the Meseglise and Guermantes ' ways ' leave us exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment and even to many mistakes, . . . by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest ". And in sifting one's reactions one may at first reject as infantile and compulsive what in a re-sifting one may accept though in a different degree and different way perhaps. " How much is this nostalgia for France ? " we may ask, and looking again at the picture see it rather differently, and then turning on ourselves once more we may say " And why not nostalgia ? Is it all to be rejected ? Isn't the Primavera what it is, in part because in the face of the Flora are so many Springs ? " It is not the mere fact that a reaction comes out of the past that makes it tyrannous-it depends on what past it comes from and what welcome it receives. Ethical effort is the weighing of considerations and, as Aristotle said, there are no rules which will enable us to avoid this effort. The trouble is we are very apt to be dissatisfied with our weighing, the weights too often and too much change with every re-weighing. It is not that we want the weights never to change. And it is not so much abrupt and even frequent change that is the trouble-it is that oscillation which finds expression in " I don't know what I really want " which is so distressing. It's all very well for the vocalist to advise "Experiment And it will lead you to the light."</page><page sequence="8">282 CRITICAL NOTICES: WADDINGTON, Science and Ethics. No doubt if you wish your child to become a connoisseur in tea you will encourage him to try lots of teas. But then tea is cheap while murder, adultery and robbery are not. Besides that way, namely, seeing life, isn't adequate even with tea, and many men " experienced with horses " even when industrious and well intentioned are very dangerous. With your tea, drinking child you will do your best in choosing the order in which he drinks the teas just as you would. over the order in which he " looks at " horses, pictures and arguments in order that he may develop with respect to these from the stage at which all are marvellous or all a bore to a stage in which he has greater discrimination. And, unfortunately, he may easily come to hate them all more and more like Mrs. Arnot Robinson, came to hate ships, or become unable to like anything except Bach and Mozart or, worst of all, come to have a strong love and hate for all. This last is best avoided and best resolved by increasing his discrimination not so much of the objects to which he reacts as of his reactions to the objects. The mother says, " How would you like it ? " i.e. " How much is your complaisance due to the fact that it's you who are pulling the cat's tail and not vice versa ? " And in this she is not merely putting something into the child but bringing out the uneasiness which lurks in him just as it did when biting her breast he laid waste his world and with it.himself. There are other ways in which analysis is connected with ethics. For example, analysis isn't concerned only with what one really approves, really accepts in oneself, but also with what one really wants, fears, loves, hates. In deciding what to do, one of the things necessary is, of course, to estimate what consequences will follow and primarily what consequences in the way of how people, including' oneself, will really feel, and that not in the way of approval or disapproval. (3) About the connexion'between what is good and what has been exemplified in the course of evolution. I heartily agree with Dr. Waddington's critics that most of what he says won't do at all and involves old muddles. But I would like to point out that on page 39 he says he means " if the ethical system is to be derived from the nature of the experimental . . . one of the most important data is the scientifically ascertained course of evolution ". If it were not for the words '.' scientifically ascertained " this might easily mean " One of the criteria as to what a man or people really want is what they tend to get hold of in the end " and then it would be right though not easily applicable except in simple matters like wine and cars. Finally, do we value Socrates (p. 38), Van Gogh (p. 90), because of their contribution to the progress of mankind ? Not on your life. Social progress be damned. It's the picture that counts.
