<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AREAS AND PERIODS IN FLORIDA TOHN M. GOGGIN* THE state of Florida is mainly a peninsula projecting some three hundred miles south of the continental North American land mass. This unique position has given the state a cer- tain amount of isolation, as a result of which, and because of environmental factors, Florida has been able to participate in the Southeastern cultural picture and at the same time to develop characteristic local features. Although Florida has had a long history of archaeological research, with an impressive bibliography of descriptive material, synthesis has only recently been attempted. Some early attempts were made to divide the state into archaeological areas but none were of any sig- nificance until M. W. Stirling's recent four-fold division into the Gulf Coast, Glades, St. Johns, and Northern Highland areas.' This division has been found, in general, to be useful, needing only greater refinement. However, stratigraphic data to give temporal perspective were lacking 27 1.

Subsequently, Gordon Willey's chronological work on the northwest coast of Florida2 and his analysis of the Weeden Island culture' marked the beginning of a new period of study. The recent work of the Yale Carib- bean Program was specifically directed towards the southern part of the state, but it has be- come apparent that an archaeological picture of the whole state is necessary in order to under- stand the situation in any part of it.

Areas and periods of culture in Florida. a chronological and cultural framework is only now being prepared, the preliminary results can be briefly presented. Considering archaeological Florida from the geographical aspect, we may delineate three major divisions, the Gulf Coast, the St. Johns, and the Glades. It is also possible to distinguish Central Florida, a division possibly of equal status, and the small Kissimmee region, which is not definitely placed. It will be seen that these divisions are very similar to the ones proposed by Stirling and mentioned above. On examining the situation still more closely, the Gulf Coast can be subdivided into three areas, the Northwest Gulf Coast, the Central Gulf Coast, and the Manatee region. Within the St. Johns there are two comparable areas, the northern St. Johns and the Melbourne region. In making this outline, chronological se- quences for three areas served as the basic temporal framework: the Northwest Gulf Coast, the Northern St. Johns, and the Glades Area. The sequence from the Northwest Gulf Coast was developed by Gordon Willey,4 and 2 Willey and Woodbury, 1942. a Willey, 1945a. 4Willey and Woodbury, 1942.</page><page sequence="3">116 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [2,1947 that for the St. Johns by James B. Griffin,5 Vera M. Masius,8 and Irving Rouse.7 The third major sequence is that worked out in the Glades area by the author,8 based in part on the work of Gordon Willey.9 Using these three sequences for cross-checking, and with the aid of seriation, it has been possible to determine the cultures and periods present in other regions. The accompanying map (Fig. 11) shows the individual archaeological areas and regions. The chronological sequence for each of these areas and the adjacent Lower Mississippi Valley, is shown on the chart (Fig. 12) as completely as the available knowledge permits. On the left side of this chart a series of dates is given. The more recent dates, from Troyville times on, are modified from Krieger's cross-dating of lower Mississippi Valley pottery types, as found in eastern Texas, with Southwestern Pueblo trade wares which can be dated by means of dendro- chronology.'0 THE NORTHWEST GULF COAST The Northwest Gulf Coast (Fig. 11:1) is a coastal strip running from Mobile Bay in Ala- bama to Apalachee Bay in Florida. It is not easy to delineate the exact depth of the area but the climax culture, Weeden Island, ap- pears to extend up the Appalachicola-Chat- tahoochee-Flint river system for over a hundred miles into the state of Georgia." Archaeological interest in the Northwest Gulf Coast has been continuous for almost a hundred years since Schoolcraft's excellent description and illustration of Fort Walton incised pottery.'2 However, this area is most closely associated with Clarence B. Moore who in the early years of this century made repeated trips along the coast and up the rivers."3 The most recent work is that of Willey and Wood- bury who re-surveyed much of the area, making key stratigraphic excavations.14 These revealed the presence of six periods representing five cultures. With one exception these cultures are almost exclusively known by their ceramic complexes. Chronology for this area is almost wholly based on the work of Willey and Wood- bury. Pre-Deptford period (?). It is possible that an early pottery-making culture existed in this region prior to Deptford times. This has been suggested by Willey and Woodbury, who found some fiber-tempered sherds in Deptford levels.'5 Such a culture presumably would be related to fiber-tempered pottery using cultures of the late Archaic. Additional fiber-tempered material from a site near St. Marks supports this pos- sibility.'6 Deptford period. The culture of the Deptford period is related to one of the same name found on the Georgia coast.'7 Knowledge concerning it is limited, but the ceramics are forms of sand- tempered pottery decorated with simple and linear check stamping.'8 Other artifacts in- clude large triangular projectile points, pebble hammer stones, and small flat whetstones. Burial mounds do not appear to have been constructed. Santa Rosa-Swift Creek period. The Santa Rosa-Swift Creek period is also one showing influence from, or connection with, Georgia. In addition, sites to the west show influence from the lower Mississippi Valley as reflected by the presence of Marksville pottery. The distinctive pottery of this period is a sand-tempered ware, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped, decorated with well executed stamping.'9 Other artifacts 6 Griffin, J. B., 1945. 6 Masius, 1947. 7 Rouse, 1947. 8 Goggin, 1947b. i Willey, 1945b. 10 Krieger, 1947. Krieger's dates for Troyville and earlier periods produce, by correlation, a too tightly compressed chronological picture in Florida. Discussion with George Quimby and James B. Griffin suggested that the early horizons of the Lower Mississippi Valley should be moved back in time, placing Tchefuncte as far back as 500 A.D. Such revision fits the Florida data somewhat more com- fortably. Therefore, this dating has been used on the lower part of the chart. See Martin, Quimby, and Collier, 1947, Fig. 122. 11 Moore, 1907b; Fairbanks, 1946. 12 Schoolcraft, 1854. 13 Moore, 1901, 1902, 1903a, 1907b, 1918. 14 Willey and Woodbury, 1942. 14 Willey and Woodbury, 1942, p. 252. 16 Specimens in Yale Peabody Museum (3837). The exact location is unknown, but it should not be confused with the St. Marks site, which has produced late metal ornaments (Goggin, 1947a). 17 The names for the archaeological periods on the Gulf Coast are also used for the cultural assemblages present at that time (Willey and Woodbury, 1942, p. 238). "8 The types Deptford Bold Check Stamped, Deptford Linear Stamped, and Deptford Simple Stamped are il- lustrated by Willey and Woodbury (1942, P1. 11, Fig. 1). 19 Swift Creek Complicated Stamped is illustrated by Willey and Woodbury (1942, Fig. 27 a, b; P1. 11, Fig. 2, a), as are the associated types, Marksville Stamped (PI. 11, Fig. 2, g), Marksville Incised (PI. 11, Fig. 2,f), and Santa Rosa Stamped (P1. 11, Fig. 2, h).</page><page sequence="4">GOGGIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL AREAS AND PERIODS IN FLORIDA 117 differ little from those of the preceding period. The most notable introduction at this time is burial mounds containing secondary and flexed burials.20 Weeden Island I period. The Weeden Island culture is the climax of development on the Gulf Coast. It has been divided into two periods on the basis of ceramics, Weeden Island I and II. In the first, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped2' continues to be present along with many new distinctive incised and punctated types of which the most skillfully decorated are Weeden Island Incised22 and Weeden Island Punctated.23 Simpler decoration is found on Carrabelle Punctated24 and Tucker Ridge Pinched.25 Painting also appears for the first time on Weeden Island Zoned Red.26 An overall study of the Weeden Island cul- ture in all parts of Florida gives us a fairly broad picture of the many other artifacts pres- ent.27 Celts and plummets are the most numer- ous of many types of stone artifacts, and trade material such as copper and sheet mica appear in some quantity. Shell objects are not abun- dant with the exception of cups or dippers (prob- ably Busycon dippers). Numerous conical sand mounds containing secondary burials have been the most com- monly excavated sites of this culture. The inter- ments often have substantial quantities of burial offerings and the custom of killing mor- tuary pottery is almost invariably indicated. Weeden Island II period. The second Weeden Island period is distinguished from the first solely on the basis of ceramic change. Swift Creek Complicated Stamped dies out by this time and a new surface textured ware, Wakulla Check Stamped,28 takes its place. This type seems to mark the resurgence of check stamp- ing from some center, possibly the Georgia coast, whence it spread southward into the St. Johns and Glades Areas and westward into the Northwest Gulf Coast. Fort Walton period. The culture in Fort Walton times represents a blend of the Floridian elements of the Weeden Island culture plus a strong Middle Mississippian influence. In terms of ceramics this resulted in a marked change in ware and decoration. Large, coarse grit re- places fine sand as a tempering material and shell is also used to some extent. Simple de- signs are now commonly confined to a band on the rim of the vessel and are formed by deep, broad-line incision and large punctations. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures are simply represented and effigy bird head "ador- nos" are often applied on the rim. Fort Walton Incised,29 which exhibits most of the above char- acteristics, is the most abundant decorated type while Safety Harbor Incised30 is less common, usually appearing only in the eastern part of the area. The latter type appears in many respects to be a degenerate form of Weeden Island Incised and Weeden Island Punctated. Little is known of other aspects of this cul- ture. Burial mounds are less common and seem to be less important. Large flat-topped temple mounds, representing Middle Mississippian influence, occur at a number of sites." Historic material appears towards the end of the period. CENTRAL GULF COAST The Central Gulf Coast (Fig. 11:2) includes the coastal strip extending east and south from Apalachee Bay to the lower end of Tampa Bay. The width of this area is undetermined, but is probably not great, although certain cultures extend up some of the rivers such as the Su- wanee.32 Archaeological work of a desultory nature has been very extensive. Walker's explorationsu were some of the earliest and were fairly impor- tant as he showed a keen awareness of many of the problems. Later workers have produced much descriptive material; Clarence B. Moore, as might be expected, has given us the most.34 Other important excavations include those of Frank H. Cushing at Tarpon Springs,35 J. Walter Fewkes at the classic Weeden Island 20 Willey and Woodbury, 1942, pp. 252-3. 21 See Willey and Woodbury (1942, Fig. 27, b; P1. 11, Fig. 2, e) for late Swift Creek Complicated Stamped. 2 Willey, 1945a, Fig. 15, b, d, e.

Willey in a forthcoming paper. Since no stratigraphic data are available for the Central Gulf Coast, the chronology must be determined by correlating local culture assem- blages with adjacent sequences. However, much excavation is necessary in order to de- termine many minor but important points. A good example of this is the burial mound at Crystal River excavated by Moore,39 which has been recently discussed by Willey and Phil- lips.40 Despite an abundance of material the site cannot be satisfactorily placed in the exist- ing cultural sequence and the strong Hope- wellian relationships are not clearly under- stood.41 The following sequence must be con- sidered as only indicative of part of the archaeo- logical picture, although its believed to indicate the dominant tradition of culture. Pre-Weeden Island period. Knowledge of the culture of this period Is very limited. Its exist- ence is based on the presence of a simple pre- mound culture reported by Fewkes42 to underlie the Weeden Island culture at the Weeden Is- land site. A large bowl from this lower level43 is said by Willey to resemble material from the Glades Area, i.e., Glades Plain pottery.44 Weeden Island I period. The presence of Weeden Island I is inferred from the occurrence of Swift Creek Complicated Stamped, the marker for this period to the north, in many sites including Weeden Island itself.45 How- ever, it has not been isolated in pure sites lack- ing check-stamped pottery which characterizes the subsequent period. Weeden Island II period. Whatever the status of Weeden Island I, there is no doubt as to the presence of Weeden Island II. In general the latter is closely similar to the same culture on the Northwest Gulf Coast. Some regional differ- ences may be noted in ceramics but no data are available for other artifacts. Weeden Island Punctated is the most abundant decorated pottery, with incised forms occurring much less frequently. In addition the typical fine grit- tempered paste is sometimes abandoned in favor of a chalky ware, probably derived from the St. Johns area. Typical Weeden Island de- signs occur on this paste as does check stamping (either St. Johns Check Stamped or Biscayne Check Stamped) which takes the place of Wakulla Check Stamped to some extent. No study has yet been made of any sites in this area except burial mounds. Many large and extensive shell middens occur which may, at least in part, have been occupied by the peoples of this period. Safety Harbor period. Despite the fact that the culture of the Safety Harbor period as a whole is little known, there is widespread evi- dence of its range and importance. The ceram- ics can be characterized as a crude degenerate form of Weeden Island Incised and Weeden Island Punctated modified by a strong Middle Mississippian influence, although not as strongly as Fort Walton Incised was affected. Fort Walton pottery accompanies local wares in varying amounts. The local decorated type is called Safety Harbor Incised.46 Most sites which date from this period can be considered as being of the Safety Harbor culture but others are perhaps more typical of Fort Walton culture although the two are closely related. Many of the non-ceramic artifacts of the Weeden Island culture continued to be used in Safety Harbor times and a number of new artifacts appeared, such as shell picks, which were apparently derived from the Glades Area. Burial mounds continued in popularity at least in the south.47 MANATEE REGION The Manatee region (Fig. 11:3) lies south of the lower end of Tampa Bay and includes the coast as far south as Charlotte Harbor. The eastward extension is uncertain but the country around Arcadia probably should be included. This area occupies a position between the Glades area and the more highly developed Central Guilf Cnact. and this nerinheral no- 36 Fewkes, 1924b. 37 Rainey, 1935. 88 Simpson, 1936; Anonymous, 1939. 39 Moore, 1903b, pp. 379-413; 1907a. 40 Willey and Phillips, 1944. 41 Greenman, 1938. 42 Fewkes, 1924b, pp. 23-6. 43 Fewkes, 1924b, P1. 24, c. 44 Willey, 1945a, p. 250. 4- Fewkes, 1924b, p. 21. 46 Willey and Woodbury, 1942, pp. 244-5. 47 Cemetery sites such as Buzzard's Island (Rainey. 1935) represent the Fort Walton culture in respect to method of interment as well as in pottery.</page><page sequence="6">GOGGIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL AREAS AND PERIODS IN FLORIDA 119 sition is clearly shown by the admixture of cul- tural contents in some of the sites. Although Walker and other early archaeol- ogists reported a number of sites in the region, little work was done in the nineteenth century.48 Moore visited the region on two trips but found little of interest.49 More recently excavations were conducted here as part of the Federal relief projects.50 Montague Tallant, an amateur archaeologist of Manatee, has excavated numer- ous sites in the last few years. Pre-Weeden Island period. Evidence for the existence of this period is not well defined, but it is quite probable that such a horizon existed. Shell mound sites containing only plain, grit- tempered pottery (Glades Plain) are reported. Such material probably equates with the Pre- Weeden Island horizon to the north and Glades I to the south. Weeden Island I period. The presence of this period is postulated because of its probable presence to the north, and because the Weeden Island culture was present at some time in the region. Complicated-stamped material, occa- sionally reported, may belong to this horizon. Weeden Island II period. Weeden Island cul- tural material occurs sporadically throughout the region but only one important site has come to the attention of the writer, a sand burial mound excavated by Montague Tallant on Cayo Palu, a small island in Charlotte Harbor, east of Boca Grande, near the southern bound- ary of the region. Englewood pottery series. This series includes several types delineated by Gordon Willey on the basis of his study of the specimens from the Englewood site. The material appears to be a local development derived from the Weeden Island tradition, but it is not known whether we are dealing with only a ceramic complex or a distinct culture. On the basis of his study, Willey is of the opinion that the Englewood series in this region can be equated in time with the Safety Harbor or Fort Walton periods.5' However, it appears that the series is even ear- lier, being also coeval with Weeden Island ma- terial. The basis of this is the presence of Englewood trade material in the Glades Area contemporaneous with Weeden Island material, as well as in a later horizon contemporaneous with Fort Walton or Safety Harbor material. The Englewood series can briefly be noted as being pottery with incised and punctate decora- tions on either chalky or gritty wares. It is more crudely executed than Weeden Island pottery and is similar to, but distinct from, Safety Harbor Incised. Pear-shaped bottles are a unique vessel form; Stirling has called some of this material Arcadia ware.52 Safety Harbor period. This period is very strongly represented in both historic and pre- historic sites. Moore illustrates Safety Harbor and Fort Walton material from sites in the southern part of the region.53 Numerous sites, some containing historic material are known in the vicinity of Sarasota; specimens from Pool Hammock near Laurel are in the U. S. National Museum. The cultural assemblage of this period shows numerous traits in common with the Glades Area. The bottle form is also found in Safety Harbor pottery. GLADES AREA The Glades Area (Fig. 11:4) includes all of the southern tip of the state south of Boca Grande Pass on the west coast, and below Fort Pierce on the east coast. This region comprises all of tropical Florida, and the local culture reflects this environmental influence. Archaeological interest in the area has been of long duration, dating from Jeffries Wyman's visit to the Miami River in 1870. In the follow- ing years occasional amateurs and scientists visited the region giving short accounts of cer- tain sites. Cushing's remarkable discoveries at Key Marco stimulated much interest,54 but Moore failed to repeat his finds although he visited many sites and made large collections of non-ceramic artifacts.55 Subsequent workers were numerous and included, J. W. Fewkes,56 M. W. Stirling,57 Henry B. Collins Jr.,58 Ales Hrdlicka,59 and many others. In the 1930's various Federal relief agencies sponsored ex- cavations at Belle Glade and in Dade and Broward counties. This material has been recently written up by Willev.60 The writer has 48 Walker, 1880a. 49 Moore, 1900, 1905. 60 Stirling, 1935. 61 Personal communication. 62 Stirling, 1936, p. 353. 63 Moore, 1905, Figs. 1-5.

These were based in the Tekesta sub-area on the stratigraphic sequence at Upper Matecumbe Key,84 in the Calusa sub- area on the sequence at Gordon's Pass,65 and in the Okeechobee sub-area on the Belle Glade sequence.88 All the information available on the area has been brought together in one report which is the source for the following material.87 Glades I period. This earliest period is but little known. Its existence is based mainly on data from Gordon's Pass Midden. However, information from other sites appears to supple- ment this. With our present knowledge the main characteristic of the period is the presence of plain, grit-tempered pottery, Glades Plain,8 and the absence of decorated material. Biscayne Plain pottery, a chalky ware, may also be pres- ent. Glades II period. During this period we have evidence of a well-established culture with a development of ceramic decoration in two areas. The basic grit-tempered pottery is modified by incision, producing simple repeated design mo- tifs on the east coast;69 while on the west coast an effort was made to produce more compli- cated over-all designs by a combination of in- cised lines and dashes or ticks. 70 Belle Glade Plain is found throughout the area but in great- est quantity to the north. Most of the distinctive tools and implements characteristic of the Glades Area as a whole can now be shown to be present. The Busycon and other whole shell implements apparently origi- nated on the west coast and achieved a flourish- ing development there, finally reaching the east coast late in the period. Limited evidence indicates extended primary midden burial with no grave offerings. Cere- monial development did not reach an outstand- ing stage. The use of personal ornaments was limited to a few forms, plain or incised bone pins being commonest. The few pendants or plummets are of the crudest and simplest forms. Glades III period. This period is the climax of Glades culture, marked by extensive con- tact with neighboring and other Florida peoples, as well as by great internal cultural develop- ment. There appears a shift in emphasis from the decoration of ceramics to the working and ornamentation of many other materials. Incised pottery decoration dies out in all parts except the lower east coast where a very simple form, Surfside Incised,71 is found. This pottery type is the marker for the first part of the period, Glades HIla. The second part, Glades IHIb, is characterized by another pottery type, Glades Tooled,72 confined except for occasional trade sherds, to the lower east coast. Period IlIc is distinguished by Glades Tooled pottery plus European material. In addition to the gritty ware pottery mentioned, large amounts of a chalky ware type, Biscayne Check Stamped,73 carry through all three parts of the period. Many minor types and much trade pottery are present. The other distinctive features of the period, in addition to pottery, are numerous. Various forms of ornaments were developed, shell and stone plummet pendants being common. Many objects of ceremonial nature occur, especially those of wood from Key Marco74 and sites around Lake Okeechobee, and of metal from historic sites. The general ceremonial development is also demonstrated by the construction of extensive earthwork and shell work sites comprising numerous platform mounds, ramps, ridges, canals, and enclosures.

Burial offerings are present in small quantities but indications are that the custom they represent was a late trait which became popular in European times. The interments were usually secondary. Much of the ceremonial assemblage in terms of minor artifacts appears to be locally developed, while the more impressive features such as burial mounds and ceremonial struc- tures were undoubtedly stimulated by contacts with the Weeden Island II, Fort Walton, and Safety Harbor peoples to the northwest. THE KISSIMMEE REGION The Kissimmee region (Fig. 11:5) is a some- what amorphous area tentatively considered, on poor evidence, to comprise the drainage of the Kissimmee River from Lake Tohopekaliga to the boundary of the Glades Area. Archaeo- logical work has been negligible, and Moore's visit produced little information of value.75 A. W. Conklin's description of the earthwork sites, although very limited, is probably the most illuminating paper on the area.76 Another short paper by Kinnaman notes a site at the outlet of Lake Kissimmee.77 Many undescribed sites are reported to exist in this region. Little is known of the actual archaeological cultures in the region, and for that reasona chronological column is not given on the chart. A few sherds from Bassinger (not Fort Bassinger) near the southern boundary are Glades Plain and Belle Glade Plain, common types of the Glades Area. The only other pottery examined is a Belle Glade Plain vessel with a scratched surface from Lake Kissimmee.78 Similar vessels, at least of the same ware and with the same sur- face finish but of a different form, have been found to the north near Orlando.79 THE MELBOURNE REGION The Melbourne region (Fig. 11:6) includes those parts of the Atlantic Coast and St. Johns River drainages south of Cape Canaveral and north of the Glades Area. The region oc- cupies a peripheral position both geographically and culturally between the Northern St. Johns and the Glades Area. In the earliest times the strongest cultural affiliations were with the former region, while in later times influence was strong from both directions. Early archaeological work was not extensive. Moore visited the area on several occasions, excavating mounds on Banana River.80 An unusual cache of pendants from Turkey Creek, south of Melbourne, was described in another report.8' In the following years little interest was taken in this region until the discovery at Vero of human remains and artifacts in ap- parent association with Pleistocene mam- malian fauna.82 A few years later another find was made at Melbourne with similar remains and under similar conditions."' The literature on these finds is extensive and opinions on the dating run the full gamut of possibilities. My present opinion is that these finds are probably early, that is in the recognized cultural column, but that they are not of any great antiquity. This problem is being thoroughly re-examined and evaluated in a forthcoming paper by Rouse.84 Recent interest in the region has been stimu- lated by the work of Mr. A. T. Anderson, an amateur archaeologist of Melbourne, Florida. His extensive excavations at South Indian Field, ten miles west of Malabar, came to the attention of James B. Griffin who in turn brought them to the notice of Irving Rouse. This resulted in a joint Yale Peabody Museum- University of Michigan excavation under the leadership of Dr. Rouse in the summer of 1944. Stratigraphic excavations made by Vera M. Masius85 and a survey of the general region made by Irving Rouse86 have resulted in a stratigraphic sequence which is used in this paper. Further excavations in the area were made in the summer of 1946 by Hale G. Smith at the Higgs site near Sebastian Inlet. While this is thought by some to be an Indian mis- sion site, it appears more likely to be a Spanish plantation dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century.87 Indian material in the site and nearby indicates a long aboriginal oc- cupation extending into historic times. 76 Moore, 1905, pp. 299-302. 76 Conklin, 1875. 77 Kinnaman, 1912. 78 Collected by C.

A period of non- ceramic occupation as represented in the North- ern St. Johns has not yet been found. However, it is possible that the Vero and Melbourne finds may belong in part to this horizon. Orange period. This is the earliest ceramic horizon, distinguished by fiber-tempered pot- tery of the Orange series.88 The period is best represented along the St. Johns especially at South Indian Field,89 but small sites on the ocean indicate a minor occupation of the lit- toral.90 In addition to the distinctive pottery, numer- ous steatite vessel sherds were found at South Indian Field. Other artifacts assignable to this culture include Strombus shell celts, chipped flint points, and polished bone ornamental pins. There seems to be the possibility that dogs were prized for food and apparently many were raised for eating. St. Johns I period. The abandonment of fiber-tempered pottery seems to have taken place late in the Orange period with a carry- over of the designs to a chalky ware pottery. In St. Johns I times, this decoration dies out and St. Johns Plain,9' a chalky ware, becomes the dominant form of ceramics. No decorated types occur but trade connections with the south, the Glades Area, are indicated by an appreciable quantity of Glades Plain and Belle Glade Plain pottery types. The only other type of artifact which can be assigned to this period is the Busycon gouge, but its earlier and later range is not known. It is also not known whether burial mounds were in use at this time. There is some indication that during this period the center of population shifted from the St. Johns River Valley, in the interior, to the coast. This may be the result of, or an accom- paniment of, a shift in basic subsistence from hunting to the gathering of molluscs. St. Johns II period. The final major horizon in the region is characterized by the appearance of check stamping on chalky ware, St. Johns Check Stamped.92 Burial mounds are now known with certainty for the first time. The later part of the period runs into historic times. Our knowledge concerning the snecific cultural details of the period is limited because no modern excavations have been undertaken in a prehistoric site of this horizon. The occu- pation seems to have been very extensive but mainly on the coast. It is during this period that the bulk of the larger shell middens along the Indian River were built up. THE NORTHERN ST. JOHNS REGION The Northern St. Johns Region, which in- cludes the lower St. Johns River Valley and adjacent Atlantic coast north of Cape Canav- eral, is the area with the longest history of human occupation in Florida (Fig. 11:7). In addition it is a region exhibiting many exotic cultural features which are difficult to place in their proper perspective at the present time. Aboriginal remains along the St. Johns were some of the most impressive in eastern United States with elaborate earth structures and large shell middens which stood twenty odd feet above the marshy banks of the river. It is only natural, therefore, that they attracted the at- tention of travelers at an early date. Bartram's colorful descriptions of sites are still interest- ing.93 However, the modern period of interest begins after the War Between the States when numerous northern tourists (the first of their kind) began to make steamboat trips up the St. Johns River. Many notices are available from this period, but the work of Jeffries Wyman, culminating in his final posthumous report, is most significant.94 In subsequent years other workers gave brief contributions to the archaeology.95 Clarence B. Moore began his intensive work here in 1892 and continued for a number of seasons, covering the whole St. Johns. His contributions on the archaeology of this region are perhaps the most significant of all his work. In the years following Moore's work there was little interest in the St. Johns, perhaps be- cause the feeling existed that the possibilities had been exhausted. Attention now shifted to the Atlantic Coast where Mayberry96 and Douglass97 had previously noted sites. Douglass' work was perhaps the most thorough of any on the east coast for many years.

C. Nelson to point out in care- ful detail the stratigraphic ceramic sequence at Oak Hill.102 Certain other particulars aroused interest in this general period, for instance the finding of extinct auk bones in a shell midden near Ormond.103 The recent period of archaeological research is distinguished by excavations carried out under Federal relief programs in the 1930's. Those at Ormond Beach and Cape Canaveral have been briefly discussed by Stirling.'04 F. W. Sleight reports a recent test dig on a shell mound five miles northwest of Geneva, but no details are given.105 The rather large amount of data available for a student of this region is overwhelming in its variety. There were local efflorescences which produced the "freak" mortuary pottery of the St. Johns; in addition the region exhibits the impacts of many surrounding cultural in- fluences. This is shown by the Middle Missis- sippi traits and the Georgia complicated stamped and cord-marked pottery extending southward along the coast; Griffin even infers Hopewellian influences.'06 At present it is im- possible to give a clear archaeological picture of the region, although we can present a general outline, derived mainly from stratigraphic se- quences in middens without consideration of the complex burial mound remains. The se- quence is a synthesis of the data of Wyman, Moore, and Nelson, plus inferences derived from the Melbourne region. 107 It is almost identical with the Melbourne sequence but it should be remembered that the Melbourne se- quence probably shows, fairly well, the actual situation, while this one does not illustrate the complexities. Non-ceramic horizon. The existence of a Dre- pottery culture in the St. Johns is well demon- strated by Wyman and Moore. This must have been a long intensive occupation for very large shell middens can be ascribed to the horizon. However, beyond its existence and the absence of pottery, little is known of the culture as a whole. Moore notes arrowheads in this horizon, but nothing else, and he specifically denies the presence of ornaments.'08 The bulk of the occupation at this time is believed to have been on the St. Johns River, but Nelson reports a pre-pottery level on the coast at Oak Hill.'09 It has not been noted else- where on the coast. Tick Island period. This is a fiber-tempered pottery horizon, the northern counterpart of the Orange period. As with the previous period, little is known of the total culture. The pottery, well represented in a number of collections, is a thick fiber-tempered ware, both plain and incised."10 Chipped stone is present and midden burials are occasionally found, but other cul- tural data are lacking. Occupation is mainly along the St. Johns and tributary streams, but one possible site is reported on the Halifax River on the coast."' St. Johns I period. The replacement of fiber- tempered pottery and incised decoration by a chalky ware, St. Johns Plain, is characteristic of this horizon. There is every reason to believe that some of the many burial mounds of the region were constructed at this time. Two cul- tural units isolated by Griffin,"2 Racey Point and Murphy Island, fall within the general time horizon of this period, but the few stamped sherds noted by Moore"' at the first site sug- gests that a critical examination of that cul- tural unit is necessary. Vessels, undecorated save for red paint, occur in some quantity at certain sites and may represent another cul- tural unit assignable to the period. Another tentative unit dating from the latter part of this period would include the low mounds south of Grant mound, and the Alicia mounds notable for their abundance of late Swift Creek Compli- cated Stamped pottery."14 98 Webb, 1894. 99 Brower, 1906. 100 Butler, 1917. 101 Gleck, 1894.

This was a long horizon tentatively marked by the introduction of check stamped pottery."5 As with the other periods of the region, cultural details are lack- ing. It is probable that there were numerous cul- tural units which have yet to be distinguished. Middle Mississippian influences were strong in some sites such as Mount Royal, where numer- ous artifacts attributed to the Southern or Buz- zard Cult have been found. Occupation was extensive on both the interior and coast, but it is most noticeable in the latter region where St. Johns Check Stamped pottery is abundant in large shell heaps. CENTRAL FLORIDA Central Florida (Fig. 11:8 )is not a clear-cut cultural area, but rather is the portion of the state remaining after the other regions have been delineated on all sides. In general our knowledge is scanty, but the limited informa- tion indicates that at some times, at least part of the region was culturally distinct. Early his- torical accounts testify to a large aboriginal population in the sixteenth century. Available data fall into two groups, a northern and south- ern, and for that reason we will consider each in turn without any implication of geographical or cultural importance other than convenience. Information is not available to form a chrono- logical column for this region, so none is pre- sented on the chart. Southern section. Archaeological work in this section has been done around Lakes Butler and Apoka to the west of Orlando. Some early ex- cavations were made by Featherstonhaugh, but his data are scanty."' He found historic mate- rial among other things. In 1932, Joffre L. Coe made a small test excavation in a low sand bur- ial mound on the west side of Lake Apoka. Arti- facts found included a few sherds, all grit- tempered, with one marked with check stamp- ing and another with simple stamping."17 The most fruitful source of information is a good sized collection made in this section by Adolph Meinecke."18 It includes abundant Wee- den Island material, Englewood series pottery, and many historic objects, indicating a good range of occupation with much influence from the west coast. It may be that further data will show the section to be merely an eastward ex- tension of the Central Gulf Coast region. Glades Area or Kissimmee region influence is shown by two vessels of Belle Glade Plain ware with scratched surfaces. Northern section. In this section, too, informa- tion is scanty but much undescribed material is in the Florida State Museum. The center of available knowledge is roughly Gainesville, and while there is no large amount of material avail- able from any one site, a long range of occupa- tion is indicated. Suggestions of an early occupation have been made by A.E. Jenks who reports beveled artifacts of bone and ivory in Columbia County.119 A middle period of occupation is probably represented by the two mounds near Gainesville excavated by the Bureau of Ameri- can Ethnology.120 Henry Gillman excavated sites in the vicinity of Santa Fe Lake. One sand mound may have contained Weeden Island material, to judge from his description of sherds with "indented patterns." An outstanding characteristic of the site is the presence of cremation with two hu- man crania filled with burnt bones.'2' Another mound, undoubtedly historic, contained a Spanish olive jar.'22 Sherd collections made by the writer in the vicinity of Paynes (Alachua) Prairie, south of Gainesville, contain a good proportion of grit- tempered, cob-stippled pottery.123It is possible that this may pertain to the eighteenth century Seminole occupation in the vicinity. CONCLUS IONS This survey of the archaeological picture of Florida, although brief and in places sketchy, indicates that the problem may be attacked from a combined geographical, cultural, and temporal point of view. It appears probable that there were three cultural hearths in Flor- ida which served as the main centers of develop- ment. These are the Northern St. Johns, possi- bly the oldest, the Northwest Gulf Coast, only somewhat younger, and the Glades Area. In the case of the first two areas, it is probable that, 1I6 St. Johns Check Stamped, Nelson, 1918. 'IO Featherstonhaugh, 1899. 117 Personal communication, Joffre L.

Florida's peripheral position by no means excluded it from the broader aspects of the gen- eral Southeastern prehistoric picture. Certain widespread cultural phenomena such as the early use of grit-tempered pottery and the gen- eral late distribution of check stamped pottery, which marks the beginning of Weeden Island II, St. Johns II, and Glades III periods, have counterparts outside the state. Broader cultural configurations, such as the "Middle Mississip- pian," may readily be detected in Florida and special phases, such as the Buzzard or Southern Cult traits, can also be easily seen.124 However, all foreign influences in Florida cannot be simply equated with their counter- parts. For example, Greenman125 and Griffin'26 have noted Hopewellian resemblances on the St. Johns, especially at Crystal River. Both Griffin'27 and Quimby'28 have equated the Crys- tal River culture with the latter part of the midwestern Hopewellian, coeval with Weeden Island I in Florida. While this may appear to be the logical position of the Crystal River culture to those workers looking at Florida from the north, it does not appear to fit the local details. The most intensive study of Crystal River was made by Willey and Phillips,'29 who placed the part studied in late Weeden Island times (Weeden Island II). Moore's'30 data, as inter- preted by Willey and Phillips leave no other feasible alternative, unless much of the chrono- logical sequence now in use is in error. In addi- tion, Crystal River has a greater number of specific similarities in traits with the Glades Area than does any other culture in Florida. Many of these shared traits do not appear in southern Florida until Glades III times, which is the equivalent of Weeden Island II and Fort Walton. Thus, ties to the south support the date of Willey and Phillips. Difficulties of this sort, which may be due to Florida's marginal position, will certainly in- crease with more data. Nevertheless, foreign in- fluences, both in ceramics and broader aspects, may well prove to be important temporal and cultural factors in determining the relationships of many Floridian cultures, both to each other and with other Southeastern cultures.
