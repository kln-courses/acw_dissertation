<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 562 Journal of the American Oriental Society 133.3 (2013) when, and under what circumstances the doctrine of textual falsification developed and came to be the  predominant Islamic position—is beyond the scope of the present investigation. It is to be hoped that  Nickel himself or other scholars will pursue this subject in the future. In the meantime, Nickel suggests  several issues that merit scholarly attention: (1) the need of the new community of believers to estab- lish a distinctive Islamic identity, especially in the context of polemical exchanges between Jews and  Christians, on the one hand, and Muslims, on the other, about the nature and validity of their respective  scriptures; (2) a shift in the understanding of the locus of authority from the sunna of God to the sunna  of Muḥammad, which may have undermined the authority of earlier sacred scriptures in the minds of  Muslims; (3) the growing awareness by Muslims of discrepancies between Qurʾanic narratives and  their biblical counterparts, e.g., the identity of the son who was Abraham’s intended sacrifice; (4) the  growing awareness by Muslims of anthropomorphic descriptions of God in earlier scriptures; and (5)  the emergence of the doctrine of ʿiṣma, according to which biblical figures identified as prophets in the  Qurʾan (e.g., David) should not have been portrayed as committing sins in the Hebrew Bible. In Narratives of Tampering Gordon Nickel successfully deploys the techniques of word study and  semantic analysis in an effort to disabuse scholars of the mistaken assumption that the doctrine of  textual distortion is found already in the text of the Qurʾan. This reader has in consequence been  largely disabused of this notion—albeit not entirely. In my view, greater attention should be paid to  the exegeses of Q 2:79, 3:78, and 5:13, in which verses the plain meaning points to the manipulation  of text. I am not fully persuaded by Nickel’s argument that the doctrine of textual distortion remained  largely undeveloped until the time of al-Ṭabarī. My hesitation is based in part upon the small size of  Nickel’s database, which includes only the three sources of the commentaries of Muqātil and al-Ṭabarī  and the Sīra of Ibn Isḥāq, and upon his tendency to downplay evidence inconsistent with his thesis.  One wonders if the seeming anomalies—e.g., a reference to scriptural distortion by either Muqātil or  al-Ṭabarī dismissed by Nickel as “unusual” or “isolated”—may not be the tip of an iceberg whose  body lies largely beneath the surface of the water. Another shortcoming is the absence of engagement  with the Shiʿi claim that references to ʿAlī and his family were deleted from the Qurʾan, a subject to  which Nickel devotes only one sentence (p. 231) although his bibliography includes at least two rele- vant articles and one monograph by E. Kohlberg published in 1972, 2005, and 2009, respectively (the  second article and the monograph were co-authored with Mohammed Ali Amir-Moezzi). Until the Shiʿi  data have been incorporated into the picture, Nickel’s project remains incomplete. The final typescript would have benefited from careful proofreading. There are numerous typos and  spelling errors in English (e.g., p. 71, “indentifiable”; p. 73, “thought” for “though”; and throughout,  “descendents” for “descendants”), errors of transliteration (e.g., p. 79 n. 52, Saʿd b. ʿIbādat; p. 85, anā  awalu man; p. 131, ʿᾹzab for ʿᾹzib; p. 152, al-Ḥassan for al-Ḥasan; p. 154, Abū al-ʿAliya for Abū  al-ʿᾹliya; p. 192, qarra for aqarra), and failure to italicize Arabic terms. The author does not seem  to be familiar with Arabic mā . . . min clauses and their proper translation into English. And I was  annoyed by his use of “exegete” as a verb (e.g., p. 151, “Ṭabarī exegetes Q 3:71”; cf. p. 86). David S. Powers Cornell University Entre mémoire et pouvoir: L’espace syrien sous les derniers Omeyyades et les premiers Abbassides  (v. 72–193/692–809). By Antoine Borrut. Islamic History and Civilization, vol. 81. Leiden:  Brill, 2011. Pp. xxiii + 543. $234. In this thought-provoking study, Antoine Borrut examines how Umayyad and early ʿAbbāsid Syria  are remembered in historical and other sources. He commands a wide array of sources to raise pertinent  questions about the temporal and geographical parameters that shaped later Islamic (and consequently  modern) understandings of the Umayyad period and of the transition from Umayyad to ʿAbbāsid rule.  While he does not offer a comprehensive reinterpretation of the events of the long century he examines,  he does lay the groundwork for the more sophisticated discussion that will surely follow. In particular,  </page> <page sequence="2"> Reviews of Books 563 he shows the artificiality of the tidy geographic division between Umayyad Syria and ʿAbbāsid Iraq.  He also questions how revolutionary the ʿAbbāsid revolution (which he sometimes described as a coup  d’état instead) actually was and suggests a longer, more complicated transition between Umayyad and  ʿAbbāsid rule. Borrut begins with three chapters devoted to the sources available for studying the period in ques- tion. The first chapter examines traces of Umayyad-era historical writings and includes short descrip- tions of a number of early historical writers associated with the Umayyad regime. The next chapter  describes the filters imposed upon earlier layers of historical writing by later exigencies and by the  agendas of later revisionists. Here Borrut divides two hundred years of early Islamic historical writing  (72–279/692–892) into eight phases shaped by pivotal political events. He argues that writers in each  subsequent phase reshaped earlier material to satisfy their contemporary needs. The brevity of these  phases underscores the rapidly changing political reality of the period. One wishes that Borrut would  refer back to these phases more frequently and more explicitly in later chapters. His third chapter offers  a discussion of non-Muslim sources, particularly Syriac and Armenian texts. His analysis of these  sources is particularly refreshing. While Syriac chronicles and other “outside” sources have routinely  been used to explicate or complicate chronological problems in the Arabic sources, Borrut’s analysis  is more sophisticated. He emphasizes that these works shared common sources with some Arabic  historical writings and that there was a dialogue between the Arabic and non-Arabic sources. In his fourth chapter, Borrut outlines his interpretation of the historical memory of Syria in Ara- bic sources. After explaining his understanding of “memory” in medieval sources, based largely on  theoretical works on European history, Borrut offers a thorough and thoughtful discussion of the place  occupied by Umayyad Syria in later historical works. He offers examples of the ʿAbbāsid struggle first  to treat the Umayyads as enemies, then to uphold the legitimacy of their caliphate to counter ʿAlid  claims to the contrary. He also discusses Umayyad efforts to portray themselves as heirs to the Biblical  Solomon. Most significantly, he offers a nuanced geographical analysis, arguing that the traditional  lines between Iraq and Syria were in fact imposed by later historiography. Instead, he points to the  centrality of the Euphrates River, not as a dividing line but as a focal point, a theme to which he returns  in later chapters. The following two chapters examine the changing historical images of Maslama b. ʿAbd al-Malik  and ʿUmar b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, respectively. Here Borrut draws on non-Arabic sources to illustrate that the  apocalyptic anticipation attached to these leaders permeated both Muslim and non-Muslim interpreta- tions. He describes efforts to cast Maslama as a contemporary Alexander and the subsequent revision  of this image after his failed attack on Constantinople. Borrut examines the apocalyptic vision of ʿUmar  II and the revision of this image necessitated by the uneventful passing of the year 100 a.h. and by  his subsequent death. Borrut also emphasizes the ʿAbbāsid effort to claim ʿUmar II as an exception to  Umayyad impiety and their focus on apparently pro-Hashemite decisions he made. In general these two  chapters provide thorough discussions of these pivotal, sometimes oppositional, figures. Borrut’s final two chapters address broader questions, ultimately justifying his reconsideration of  geography and periodization. Chapter seven takes on the ʿAbbāsid revolution, questioning the central- ity of the defeat of Marwān II in 132/750. Borrut emphasizes the ambiguous role of ʿAbd Allāh b.  ʿAlī, the ʿAbbāsid governor of Syria who had caliphal pretentions. He also argues that the real shift in  power did not occur until 136/754 when Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Saffāḥ died. Prior to this the ʿAbbāsids had a  strong Syrian presence. It is not until after his death that Arab vs. Persian and Syria vs. Iraq narratives  appear. Non-Muslim sources also point to 136/754 as the turning point, while ignoring the revolu- tion in 132/750 altogether. Borrut argues that a major historiographical revision occurred, creating  the emphasis on 132/750 as the beginning of the new dynasty. This revision, largely a product of the  post-Sāmarrāʾ phase of his historiographical periodization, required that the ʿAbbāsid connection to  their Syrian home at al-Ḥumayma be minimized. It also required that ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAlī be portrayed  as a rebel rather than as a viable claimant to the ʿAbbāsid throne. Geographically, this revision moved  the center of gravity to the east and imposed the division between Umayyad Syria and ʿAbbāsid Iraq. In his final chapter, Borrut turns to physical evidence to support his argument. He provides a thor- ough discussion of Umayyad efforts to claim the Syrian landscape both for their religion and their  dynasty, emphasizing the utility of the so-called desert palaces for projecting power, facilitating both  </page> <page sequence="3"> 564 Journal of the American Oriental Society 133.3 (2013) commerce and political control. He illustrates that, despite its status as the capital, Damascus was  not the focal point of caliphal attention. Instead a number of caliphs circulated primarily in the Jor- danian desert while others, particularly Hishām b. ʿAbd al-Malik, looked to the north to the environs  of Palmyra. This northward and eastward shift, continued by Marwān II when he moved his capital  to Ḥarrān, is particularly significant. Borrut points out that the early ʿAbbāsids followed Hishām’s  example and chose residences like al-Anbār and Raqqa, which hugged the Euphrates. The continuity  implied by these choices illustrates that the ʿAbbāsid revolution was not so radical a rupture as the tra- ditional chronologies suggest. Instead of a sudden shift from Syria to Iraq, from Arab to Persian, from  proto-Sunni to pseudo-ʿAlid, the revolution merely shifted the de facto capital a few miles across the  Euphrates, where Marwān II had already ventured in moving to Ḥarrān. Borrut’s work gives scholars of Umayyad and early ʿAbbāsid history much to consider. His decon- struction of both the geographic and temporal parameters to which we are so accustomed raises a  number of difficult questions that will require further research. In particular, the divisions within the  ʿAbbāsid family, long acknowledged but poorly understood, need to be revisited. Were these selfish  rivalries or did they represent more significant dissension about the nature of the “revolution” and the  relative geographic prominence Syria would play under the new regime? A more painstaking evalua- tion of the process of revision Borrut describes is also essential. Borrut paints in broad strokes without  becoming mired in isnād analysis and other technicalities. Future works will need to embrace these  minutia. This book is a welcome addition to the growing literature on the Umayyad period. It will cer- tainly provoke additional discussions of the second/eighth century, as well as the later historiography  that shaped our vision of the Umayyad era. Steven C. Judd Southern Connecticut State University The Transformation of Muslim Mystical Thought in the Ottoman Empire: The Rise of the Halveti  Order, 1350–1650. By John J. Curry. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010. Pp. xviii  + 330. $105. John Curry’s book is an important contribution to the history of Sufism in the early Ottoman empire.  Based on an in-depth analysis of Sufi writings, it leads the reader to the very heart of Sufi life that  developed in Anatolia in a broad social, political, and religious context. This work belongs to the very  valuable trend in the study of mysticism that takes advantage of Sufi texts, whether theological or  hagiographical, and thus informed by an understanding of the mechanisms of assimilation and trans- formation of earlier traditions, as well as of the contemporary aims of the writers, John Curry’s foray  into writing history is successful indeed. The study concentrates on the Halveti order, which has been, with its various branches, the most  widespread Sufi path (tarikat) within the Ottoman realm. The book is interesting for three reasons. One,  it relates as far as possible the history of the origins of the path and its expansion into Ottoman Anatolia,  about which until now there was only a rough idea. Two, it presents aspects of the mechanisms of the  formation of the order’s branches, through the analysis of shaping of the Şaʿbâniye, a Halveti branch with  its center in Kastamonu. And, finally, it provides insights into the position that some Halveti shaykhs took  in the religious debates that roiled the Ottoman empire in the first decades of the seventeenth century  concerning the cult of saints or the Sufi dance (semâʿ, devrân)—even before the famous period of the  Kâdızâdelis—and the stakes (even juridical) of the polemics the Halvetis were involved in. The book is divided into three parts. The first and the second relate the origins and the first expan- sion waves of the order in Anatolia, while the second and the third highlight the formation of the  Şaʿbâniye and its crystallization at the beginning of the seventeenth century in a specific political and  religious context. If the second part is pivotal, it is because it relates the life and the activities of the  eponymous saint of the Şaʿbâniye, Şaʿbân-i Veli (d. 1569), and of some of its successors, before ʿÖmer  al-Fuʾâdî really founded the Halveti network with its center in Kastamonu. </page> </plain_text>
