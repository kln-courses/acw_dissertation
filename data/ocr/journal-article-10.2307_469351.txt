<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction: A. J. Greimas* Paul Perron NTIL RECENTLY, English readers have had access to Algirdas Julien Greimas's theories mainly through the commentaries of critics,1 or the numerous more or less well-founded ap- plications that often consist in simply projecting the elementary struc- ture of signification (the semiotic square) on various cultural and social objects. However, in the last few years most of A. J. Greimas's major texts have appeared, or are about to appear, in English translation,2 finally giving critics direct access to his work and making it possible for them to evaluate for themselves the importance and heuristic value of the global theory in the analysis of literary texts. The first article written by A. J. Greimas, on Cervantes and Don Quixote, was published in 1943 in the Lithuanian journal Varpai, Al- manach littiraire. His most recent important work, de l'imperfection, was published some forty-four years later and focuses on a series of liter- ary texts composed by five authors from different countries and tra- ditions: Michel Tournier, Italo Calvino, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jun'ichiro Tanizaki, and Julio Cortaizar.3 One might assume that Grei- mas has come full circle and returned to his first literary concerns. But on closer examination, it can be seen that, throughout his career, literature has been an ongoing preoccupation; he has written, and continues to write, on a wide variety of topics directly and indirectly related to this domain: the Russian folktale and the folktale in general ("Le conte populaire russe, analyse fonctionnelle" [1965]; with Joseph Court6s, "Cendrillon va au bal ... Les r6les et les figures dans la litterature orale franpaise" [1978]), structural linguistics and poetics ("Les relations entre la linguistique structurale et la po6tique" [1967]), ethnic literature ("La litterature ethnique" [1970]), mythology ("Com- parative Mythology" [1963]; "116ments pour une th6orie de l'interpr6tation du r6cit mythique" [1966]; Des dieux et des hommes [1986]), semiotics and poetics (Essais de sbmiotique poetique [1972]), the * I would like to thank Frank H.

In his programmatic lecture "On Meaning," the first article in this volume, Greimas defines some general principles on which his semi- otics rests, then traces the progressive conceptualization of the theory, mapping out future areas of research. He briefly situates his own work within the intellectual context of his times and acknowledges the importance for him of anthropology (Claude Levi-Strauss), folklore (Vladimir Propp), linguistics (Ferdinand de Saussure, and especially Louis Hjelmslev), mythology (Georges Dumezil), and phenomenol- ogy (Marcel Merleau-Ponty). In addition to several of the above, whose research can be considered a direct consequence of the Saus- surian epistemological break, one can also recognize the impact of others, such as Roland Barthes, Emile Benveniste, Michel Foucault, Roman Jakobson, Jacques Lacan, and Hans Reichenbach, in refram- ing his own work during the 1960s and 70s.5 It is within this context that Greimas conceived his project of establishing semiotics on a "scientific," or at least systematic basis. He considers the scientific attitude as an ideology, as a quest for knowledge whereby the modal- ized subject renounces this object of value in favor of its transmittal to the sender, society.6 Furthermore, as Herman Parret notes,7 Grei- mas's project must be understood in terms of several predominant European intellectual traditions (structuralism, phenomenology, and narratology). Thus his semiotics is difficult to reconcile with other semiotic theories, for example the Peircian paradigm founded on different anthropological and epistemological presuppositions.8 For Greimas's theoretical development, the Danish School of Glos- somatics and Hjelmslev's conception of language were more impor- tant than Saussure's.9 Greimas borrowed from Hjelmslev the concept</page><page sequence="3">INTRODUCTION 525 of semantic universe (coextensive with the concept of culture), de- fined as the totality of significations prior to its articulation. The semiotic existence of this universe implies its inscription in the struc- ture that links the subject to the object of knowledge. However, since the semantic universe (the set of the systems of values) cannot be conceived of in its totality, Greimas introduced the concepts of se- mantic microuniverses and universe of discourses. The semantic mi- crouniverse, which is apprehensible as meaningful only if particular- ized and articulated, is paradigmatically and syntagmatically manifested by means of discourses. The semantic universe, however, can be reconstituted by reestablishing isotopies and the basic axiolo- gies; it is self-sufficient and allows for the occurrence of intertextu- alities and semiotic syncretisms; whereas the discourse universe in- cludes references to the "exterior" world (SL 361). From this perspective, literary discourse is defined as a specific re- alization of the discourse universe, with the difference that, compared to other semiotic systems, for example, legal or religious discourse, it cannot be characterized by a specific content. Its content plane is coextensive with the semantic universe encompassed by a natural lan- guage, whereas the literary plane provides expressive forms that are responsible for its organization and are identified by discursive lin- guistic articulations (SL 179). Hence, the discursive universe encom- passing literary discourse is seen as a mediating instance articulating the two macrosemiotics of language and the natural world, which are vast reservoirs of signs where numerous semiotic systems are mani- fested. The natural, or extralinguistic world (the world of "common sense") is given form by human beings and constituted by them as signification. Far from being the referent (the denotative signified of natural language), such a world is a biplanar language,'0 a natural language. These theoretical distinctions make it possible to reduce the question of "reference" in literary discourse to a problem of in- tersemioticity, that is to say, to the correlation between two semiotic systems. Conceived as a natural semiotic system, the referent and/or the extralinguistic context have no need to exist as linguistic concepts, and the question of reference in literary discourse can be relegated to a problem of veridiction, an intrinsic property of the saying and the said, and to the construction of an internal referent and a referential discursive level that provides a basis for other levels (SL 260-61). The problem that needs to be addressed here is not that of the referent, but rather, that of referentialization. We need to examine the proce- dures by which the "reality" and "truth" meaning effect is estab- lished-to examine, for example, how the figures of the plane of expression of the natural world (perceptible figurative, spatial, and</page><page sequence="4">526 NEW LITERARY HISTORY temporal categories), and those of the plane of content (modal and/or syntactic investments that define the relation of the subject to the world already constituted as representation), are manifested. The fact that natural language takes up these "natural" entities that maintain an identity independent from their verbal articulation does not de- tract from the relatively autonomous nature of the figurative dimen- sion of literary discourse." The criterion of figurativity that characterizes literary and historical discourses is opposed to nonfigurative discourses such as scientific or philosophical ones but allows for the inclusion of other types of fig- urative discourse (for example, mythology and folklore). This dichot- omy makes it possible to consider literary discourse as part of a gen- eral typology of discourses and, within the general framework of literary semiotics, to distinguish between an ethno-literary semiotics, concerned with discourses of archaic microsocieties, or surviving groups, and a socio-literary semiotics, which studies social discourses of industrial macrosocieties. This broad domain of literary semiotics encompassing both ethno and socio-literary discourses has been a focal point of Greimas's work. It should be stressed, though, that Greimas's concerns are not simply speculative and abstract, but that his theoretical practice is founded on the analyses of actual texts. Since literary discourse can be defined as a signifying whole and the literary text as syncretizing several semiotics, textual analysis consists first of all in showing how this discourse integrates the various semi- otics constituting it. This means identifying descriptive procedures or classes of operations, which, in fact, involve constructing a descrip- tive language, thereby making it possible to distinguish between two linguistic levels-the object language, or semiotic system, and the metalanguage. Hence, coming to grips with the problem of significa- tion in a literary text consists in transposing one level of language into a different language by constructing an adequate metalanguage and working out techniques of transposition. Nevertheless, a fundamental difficulty encountered by those who attempt to master the intricacies of Greimas's semiotics stems from the rigorous conceptualization of its descriptive language that contains its own rules and constitutes a semiotic system with a hierarchy of definitions.'3 Furthermore, the concepts of the system, established as postulates, are integrated into a network of interdefinitions that en- sure its internal coherence. An additional difficulty resides in the fact that concepts drawn from other theories need to be interdefined with respect to those of the host system, which involves working out all the necessary theoretical mediations for transposing them from one the- ory to another.</page><page sequence="5">INTRODUCTION 527 The concept of narrativity and the descriptive procedures of nar- ratology are at the very core of Greimas's semiotic. We noted that the semantic universe could be apprehended only when articulated or narrativized. So too with meaning that can be conceived of as such only when manifested in the form of articulated signification: "the production of meaning is, consequently, in itself, a signifying endow- ing with form, indifferent to the contents to be transformed. Meaning, in the sense of the form of meaning, can thus be defined as the possibility of transforming meaning."'14 While, on the one hand, narratology made it possible to analyze narratives as descriptions of the transformations of connected actions and showed the existence of more abstract and deep organizations, narrativity, on the other hand, appeared as the organizing principle of all discourse, whether figurative or nonfigu- rative (SL 209). Yet, though narratology provided Greimas with sev- eral fundamental concepts (for example, LUvi-Strauss's paradigmatic organization of narrative and Propp's syntagmatic cover), it should be stressed, once again, that these concepts were not simply borrowed but were modified, transformed, problematized, and redefined be- fore being integrated into the global theory. A case in point is Propp's thirty-one functions, which were initially defined to account for the morphology of the folktale. But what initially described the morphol- ogy of the folktale at the level of events was transformed over the years by Greimas into a model of syntactic structures governed by intersubjective relations.'5 He developed a modal semiotics that de- fined the manipulating and sanctioning subject and opened the way to a semiotic of passions that studied both how passions modified a subject's cognitive and pragmatic performances, and how epistemic categories, such as knowing and believing, modified the subject's com- petencies and performance.16 "On Meaning," "On Narrativity," "The Veridiction Contract," "De- scription and Narrativity: 'The Piece of String,' " and "Figurative Se- miotics and the Semiotics of the Plastic Arts," spanning some twelve years of work carried out by Greimas and his research group in Paris,"7 are intended to provide readers with an overview of the de- velopment of the theory and to show its ongoing, prospective, and constructive nature. In "On Narrativity" Paul Ricoeur and A. J. Grei- mas discuss some of the fundamental issues raised both in "On Meaning" and in the philosopher's clear and lucid chapter entitled "Greimas's Narrative Grammar." Ricoeur opens the discussion by de- fining semiotic rationality as a second order intelligibility, which has as its object our preunderstanding of narratives, not the narrative struc- tures themselves. For Ricoeur and Greimas, the explanatory capacity of semiotics can increase one's ability to read and understand literary</page><page sequence="6">528 NEW LITERARY HISTORY texts, and their dialogue explores just how this can occur by examin- ing: (a) the relationship between deep structures and the figurative level of narrativity (Is the figurative simply a surface structure? Or is figurativity also found at the deep level of discourse?); (b) the trans- positional nature of the model (Is there indeed an increase of signi- fication in the passage from deep structures to surface structures?); and (c) the status of enunciation and point of view (Can other narra- tological concepts be integrated within the theory?). To deal with these crucial issues for the study of literary texts, Ricoeur stresses the need for the theory to open up to other narratological concepts, and, as can be seen from the recent publications by Greimas and research- ers of the Paris School, this has progressively occurred over the last few years.'8 In "The Veridiction Contract" Greimas considers discourse as the fragile locus where truth and falsehood, lie and secret are inscribed and can be read. Texts are understood as complex signs about which cultures adopt attitudes defined as their connotative metasemiotic interpretations, and as having their own veridiction markers that limit their interpretations. Within our present-day cultural context of dis- cursive manipulation, the subject of enunciation no longer seeks to produce a true discourse, but rather to produce "truth" meaning effects, either by subjectivizing or objectivizing camouflage. The con- tract of veridiction, which supposes an implicit fiduciary agreement between two actants in the structure of communication, implies two autonomous components (the modalities of knowing and believing) and two superimposed levels (epistemic judgment-certitude and alethic judgment-truth). The only analysis of a literary text to appear in this volume, "De- scription and Narrativity: 'The Piece of String,' " was initially to be part of a much more ambitious project that was to include all of Maupassant's short stories. Greimas's analysis begins by examining formal procedures (spatiotemporal and grammatical criteria) for seg- menting texts into sequences, before showing that in this type of text, description (surface structure) is organized according to the rules of narrativity (deep structure). The narrative is seen as the confrontation between two types of knowledge and practice (being and doing), whereby individual and social knowledge and practice are opposed. Though the analysis focuses mainly on the peasants' arrival at the market place and lunch at the innkeeper's, description appears as a micronarrative in which collective desire and the figurativized subject are instituted and social practice and social sanction are demon- strated. This text has other important theoretical implications of a</page><page sequence="7">INTRODUCTION 529 general nature, since it contributes to the study of the construction of collective actants. The analysis of Maupassant's short story briefly explored the rela- tionship between the figurative and cognitive dimensions of the tra- ditional short story. "The Cognitive Dimension of Narrative Discourse" offers a theoretical model that can account for figurative discourses in general, defined as discourses whose content corre- sponds to something on the expressive level of the natural semiotic system. Here, the term "cognitive" refers to various forms of articu- lation of knowing, for example, organization, production, manipula- tion, and reception. Hierarchically superior to the pragmatic dimen- sion that acts as its internal referent, the cognitive dimension unfolds in conjunction with an increase in knowing of the subjects installed in the discourse, whether they happen to be enunciator or enunciatee and/or actants in the narration, such as narrator and/or narratee. Within the framework of the communication schema, the transmis- sion of the object of knowledge brings into play intersubjective rela- tions of persuasion and interpretation. The subjects of cognitive per- formance (persuasion and interpretation) require a corresponding competence. This gives rise to a semiotics of manipulation and sanc- tion of a polemico-contractual nature, in which subjects can inter- changeably assume the roles of either sender or receiver. Their study makes a fundamental contribution to literary semiotics by laying the groundwork not only for a typology of cognitive subjects and a semi- otics of manipulation, but also for a typology of cognitive discourses that play on either the interpretive and/or the persuasive activities of enunciators and enunciatees. A widely held misconception regarding Greimas is that his semiotics deals only with abstract schemata and is not concerned with daily life and lived experience. This is certainly not the case: his semiotics is about individuals and natural and cultural worlds, and "Figurative Semiotics and the Semiotics of the Plastic Arts" should go a long way toward laying this misconception to rest. Greimas begins by stipulat- ing the existence of a reading grid, subject to cultural relativism, in which the figurative forms of visual figures are identified as "representing" objects of the world transformed into object-signs through semiosis. In this figurative semiotics, semiotic objects are not given but are the result of reading constructions. Greimas sets in place procedures that can help account for the articulation and manipula- tion of contents, that determine the multiple forms of meaning and the modes of its existence, and that describe the pathways of the transposition and transformation of contents.</page><page sequence="8">530 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In the first part of this introduction, we noted that Greimassian theory gave importance to the concept of narrativity, defined as the immanent organizing principle of all semiotic systems whether verbal or not. The strength of the theory lies in the fact that it distinguishes between two levels of representation and analysis: a manifest level and an immanent level of narrative that forms a common structural source where narrativity is situated prior to its manifestation. Hence, the signification of figurative and plastic phenomena, originating in this fundamental model, is independent of their mode of manifestation. In order to understand how and what plastic figures signify, one needs to come to grips with the problem of defining figures found on the surface and grouping them into signifying ensembles. This volume also contains seven contributions by authors who, over the years, have carried on a dialogue and debate with Greimas's work. A number of these studies raise epistemological questions that are related to either the coherence of the model or to its fundamental presuppositions. Others, more concerned with its applicability, ques- tion the empirical relevance of the theory, while proposing refine- ments and corrections to its epistemological postulates and philosoph- ical axioms. Two papers focus on the basic postulates of Greimas's semantics and the relationship between the thymic, praxic, and cognitive dimen- sions of narrative grammar. In their incisive text entitled "Greimas- sian Semantics and the Encyclopedia" Umberto Eco and Patrizia Ma- gli examine the foundations of the theory from the perspective of dictionary or encyclopedic representation. They argue that, even though in Structural Semantics Greimas makes use of Hjelmslev's con- cept of dictionary, because it takes into account a plurality of contexts, such a dictionary functions much like an encyclopedia. Furthermore, since the lexeme presented in early Greimassian theory undergoes encyclopedic transformation, it is said to be the product of history or usage, rather than structure, and that the problem of the organization of content "depends on the perceptive and the phenomenological signified of figures of the world." We stressed above that the source of the figures of natural language is found in a semiotics of the nat- ural world. The authors also insist on the same point and show how, in fact, the progressive transformation of his theory into a theory of discourse makes it possible to consider the lexeme as a virtual text. They provide an articulated description of the morphology and syn- tactic functioning of the encyclopedia within narrativity. Moreover, they maintain that with the notion of discursive and motive configu- ration, Greimas introduces notions very similar to those of scenario and frame used in artificial intelligence research. The authors con-</page><page sequence="9">INTRODUCTION 531 clude by noting that "what we shall call the Greimassian encyclopedia does not present itself only as a universe of images of the world, or as the set of possible destinies of a lexical unit, or even as a repository of a collective memory, but also as a dynamic system of syntactic and for- mal relations that articulates the cognitive competence of the subjects in a communication situation." Paul Ricoeur's paper, "Greimas's Narrative Grammar," written in 1980, had a strong impact on the orientation of the theory. Ricoeur criticizes the Greimassian model on several counts. First, how can logico-deductive structures such as contradiction at the deep level be converted into anthropomorphic polemic at the surface level? Sec- ond, there exist syntagmatic supplements at the surface level that cannot be obtained from the conversion of the fundamental grammar to the surface grammar. Third, one has to recognize the dual con- straints, both logical and practical, of the model and the necessity to clarify the conditions of its application. Ricoeur's insightful paper was instrumental in bringing about a reevaluation of Greimas's theory; it led to important methodological changes that reformulated action and syntactic operations anthropomorphically and substituted the formal term, generic doing, for all verbs of action. He also introduced the concept of process as a transcoded doing, an aspectualized and converted doing.19 The papers by Cesare Segre and Wladimir Krysinski examine de l'imperfection, the author's most recent theoretical-literary production. The critics feel that this work opens up a new field of investigation for which the method and theme seem undeducible from Greimas's prior semiotics of narrativity and modality. Cesare Segre's study begins by exploring the faintly discernible traces by which Greimas's techniques of analysis weave through sug- gestion a web in which semiotic terms coexist with visual and tactile sensations. The aesthetic experience is seen as the fusion of the sub- ject with a reality (object) that absorbs but, at the same time, dissolves him. Compared with Maupassant, which remains more in line with Greimas's earlier interests in which he brought his entire systematic semiotic arsenal into play, de l'imperfection is seen as a text in which there is a deployment of style that constitutes a radical break with the previous enterprise. In the second part of his article, Segre explores the coherence and systematicity of the work in general. He then contends that a Grei- massian vulgata came into being in which researchers associated with him uncritically accepted the techniques proposed without investigat- ing their bases. Perhaps this was the case until quite recently; never- theless, even a cursory examination of volume II of the Dictionnaire</page><page sequence="10">532 NEW LITERARY HISTORY edited by Greimas and Courtes in 1986, in which entries were written by forty contributors, clearly shows that this no longer applies. In- deed, the editors have explicitly indicated the status of these entries in relationship to the theory presented in volume I by classifying them as either: (C) complement, continuation, conformity; (P) proposition, prolongation, project; or (D) debate, discussion, divergence, digres- sion. Nonetheless, Segre concludes his article by reflections on the recent evolution of Greimassian semiotics and the new face it offers us in trying to come to grips with the subjective, the ecstatic, and the sacred. Wladimir Krysinski's paper focuses on the problem of aesthetic perception explored by Greimas as the stages and forms of transfor- mation which subject and object undergo. He points out that, since the author presupposes the existence of being (perfection) existing above or beyond seeming (imperfection), the "cognitive and quasi- utopian stance of this discourse is to be found in the conviction that although every seeming is imperfect, it hides being--if only, at times, to unveil it and to open unto death or life." Since for Greimas the aesthetic experience is understood as a fundamental experience that leads toward a new understanding of life, his message is considered as essentially ethical. Krysinski shows how for Greimas the aesthetic ex- perience originates in the canonical actantial relationship between a subject and an object of value, in which beauty appears in the narra- tive process and is analyzed in terms of a narrative sequence. The semiotic existence of the subject is guaranteed by a particular type of conjunction with the object of value (virtualizing, actualizing, realiz- ing), and beauty emerges in the synthetic conjunction with a partic- ular situation: "the object's emergence as visible form and the sur- passing of every day life by the subject." Krysinski gives an extremely sensitive account of Greimas's analysis of five literary texts in which the aesthetic experience is described as a complex and complete nar- rative process, whereby the actantial subject is defined as a narrative, pathemic, and cognitive actant. The second section of the paper con- centrates on the last part of Greimas's book, entitled "Ways Out," which is "an extremely dense general reflection on and plea for aes- thetic experience in life in today's society." Here Krysinski accentuates the utopian aspect of the enterprise in which the aesthetic experience is conceptualized and described in semiotic terms and an attempt is made to draw semiotics into an engagement with life. The two studies by Donald Maddox and Felix Thuirlemann analyze different narrative objects and enrich and supplement the basic the- ory. Thiirlemann's paper, "Fictionality in Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece," can be considered as an application and development of</page><page sequence="11">INTRODUCTION 533 Greimas's chapter on visual semiotics. Thuirlemann begins with a cri- tique of the representational position that defines the iconic sign in terms of its resemblance to an external referent. He proposes instead an examination of the semiotic principles involved in creating a ref- erential illusion from the dual principles of utterance and enuncia- tion. His paper also helps to dispel the notion that Greimassian theory is basically achronic, since he clearly shows that it is possible to con- sider that the mimetic dimension of a work of art, such as the San Zeno Altarpiece, as well as its other levels of meaning, are historically mediated. Three areas of concern are raised within the vast domain of visual semiotics: (a) pictorial discourse is a mimetic discourse that can be considered as a metadiscourse on its own process of construction; (b) the mimetic image can be analyzed as the end term of a generative process occurring on the planes of expression and content; and (c) the type of semiosis that frequently occurs in the visual arts is semisym- bolic in nature and made up of categorical webs. This innovative study concludes with an investigation of the aesthetic limits, or how the image "uses its own internal devices to define spatially the rela- tionship between its fictional world and the world beyond it, that of the viewer's reality," and an examination of the narrative devices by which the "figurative picture makes behavioral demands on the recipient." In his paper "Veridiction, Verifiction, Verifactions: Reflections on Methodology," Donald Maddox briefly reviews the salient features of the theory from a historico-notional perspective and centers on an area that has not been sufficiently explored until now. Noting that Greimas's suggestion regarding the possibility of establishing a typol- ogy of discourse, based on modes of veridiction, has not given results in the realm of literary discourse, Maddox proposes a study of specific cases of veridiction that can provide access to a vital dimension of the literary text and contribute to rethinking the literary critical enter- prise itself. By directly linking such a semiotic theory of veridiction to reading and interpretation, he makes it a concern of literary criticism. Maddox indicates the need to expand current methodology that only considers the classification of cognitive transformations along the syn- tagmatic unfolding of narrative and to envisage veridiction as a type of coherence within discourse. In a semasiological move he analyzes veri-dictory modalities that result in truth semantic effects (verum), uttered (dicere) by different voices, or from different cognitive per- spectives, in order to identify the constituents as well as the structu- ration of veridictory discourse. His detailed analysis of a short story by Guy de Maupassant to measure the working hypothesis taken from Bakhtin, according to which "one might expect that as the reservoir of</page><page sequence="12">534 NEW LITERARY HISTORY knowledge expands with the proliferation of voices, each offering its own cognitive perspective, there would be a corresponding increase in the density and complexity of the veridictory coherence," is exem- plary of the creative tension that can exist between theory and prac- tice, by which the former is reevaluated and rectified through con- frontation with the latter. Maddox concludes his text with a reflection on the "domain of criticism and the attitudes of its practitioners to- ward the objects of critical enquiry." Eugene Vance proposes both a critique of the Greimassian project and an alternative way of reading medieval texts, for "a new kind of linguistically informed medievalism has evolved that is as much ori- ented toward studying the discursive consciousness of medieval intel- lectual life as it is toward the documentation of events." In his study Vance raises questions not only about some of the epistemological foundations of the model, but also about its applicability and its em- pirical relevance for the discipline of medieval studies. It is legitimate, though, to ask to what Greimassian model and to what account he is referring. As can be seen from the texts ascribed to Greimas and those written by other critics in this volume, the initial claims made for and about postwar semiotics and the "Parisian school" do not exactly cor- respond to the current state of affairs. Rather than eluding "the de- terminations of national language, culture, and epoch," Greimassian semiotics recognizes not only the fundamental determinations of na- tional language, culture, and epoch, but also the interdependence of the natural world and natural languages, which are p!- ces for the elaboration and practice of multiple semiotic systems."2 These semi- otic systems precede the individual, "who is inscribed from birth within a signifying world made up of both 'nature' and 'culture,' and is progressively integrated therein through experience." Far from being a neutral referent, nature is "strongly culture bound ... and by the very same token, nature is relativized (ethno-taxonomies provide dif- ferent 'world views,' for example) (SL 374; emphasis added). Again, Segre's and Krysinski's accounts of de l'imperfection clearly demon- strate that, although Greimas does-as Vance says-"insist on the constitutive role of the semiotic square in all semantic processes," he certainly does not continue to insist "on the primacy of modals to the syntax of stories, and on the adequacy of the Greimassian actantial model to decode the syntactic operations of any message or discourse," since his analysis bears especially on the discursive and figurative dimension of the unfolding narrative. As for the semiotic square, it can be compared with Blanche's hexagon and to Klein's and Piaget's groups.21 To criticize Greimas for being "closed to the history of semiotics" is</page><page sequence="13">INTRODUCTION 535 to ignore the scientific and intellectual tradition his work is rooted in and to disregard the basic aims of systematicity and the project of "scientificity."22 In an interview with Herman Parret, published in 1974, Greimas clearly states that "every scientific approach is reduc- tionist by definition-and it cannot be otherwise.... Every scientific approach supposes the choice of a definite level of generality and the treatment of individuals inside classes. Scientific research is first of all a research for invariants.... Linguists have never tried to fool any- body, and philosophers are responsible for their own illusions."23"" To put it another way, as Donald Maddox has so succinctly shown in the final part of his study, this debate not only opposes two attitudes concerning the issue of referential truth and veridiction, but also concerning the ability of various semiotic models to show "how texts were 'seen' in the Middle Ages or ... how they should be 'read' now, for each has its own variant interpretation of the cultural context, its own Middle Ages." Be that as it may, in the second part of his study Vance gives an overview of a number of broadly held medieval se- mantic theories that are of great interest to modern semioticians, since they clearly demonstrate that texts must be understood in terms of the multiple semiotic systems they syncretize. The final and main part of the paper examines the Pardoner's "Prologue" in the Canterbury Tales and, through textual analysis and social contextualization, attempts to "reconstruct the social issues that are at work in the poet's web of words," in order "to grasp the full materiality of his or her discourse." In addition to reading this text as a "brilliant fiction of human character," Vance concludes that "the axis of fiction embodies, as well, a true plane of social consciousness expressed through language." In the final paper of the volume, entitled "A Logic of Narrativity," Philip Sturgess proposes an alternate and more restricted solution to the problem of narrativity than does Greimas. His theory deals only with narrative texts written in natural languages and not with all forms of discourse, and it does not encompass other semiotic systems that are independent of natural languages. Sturgess defines narra- tivity as a dynamic process that functions syntagmatically in every text, whether ancient, modern, or postmodern. Contrary to Greimas, for whom narrativity is the organizing and transformational principle of the syntactic and semantic components, not only of the deep and surface levels of the semio-narrative grammar but also of the discur- sive structures, for Sturgess, narrativity essentially corresponds to the logical syntagmatic unfolding of the discursive and figurative evene- mential levels of text. In Greimas's theory narrativity can be seen as the processes accounting for signification that transform the value systems set in place, while for Sturgess narrativity is what guarantees</page><page sequence="14">536 NEW LITERARY HISTORY both the transformation of events and the coherence of texts. In his transpositional model of meaning, Greimas defines the operators at the deep and intermediate levels in terms of actants and narrative programs, and, at the surface discursive level in terms of actors (ac- torialization, spatialization, and temporalization), whereas in his syn- tagmatic model of action and causality, Sturgess concentrates on char- acters at the discursive and figurative levels of texts. In short, Greimas adopts a semio-narrative perspective while Sturgess works within the tradition of general narratological studies, and it is within this frame- work that he provides us with a comprehensive theory of the logic of narrativity that constitutes an original and important contribution to modern text theory. The aim of this volume has been not only to make available a number of texts written by, on, and about Greimas, but also to con- tribute to the debate on the foundations and the developments of this theory (and semiotic theory in general), especially its significance for the analysis of literary texts. The various problems raised, and the different directions taken by the contributors, attest to the openness of the theory and the dynamic quality of the research programs in question. However, many key issues are yet to be resolved, and if this volume fosters ongoing discussion, it will more than have fulfilled its purpose.

According to Hjelmslev, biplanar semiotic systems are those which contain two levels which differ in their paradigmatic articulations and/or syntagmatic divisions. 11 Jacques Geninasca, Pour une simiotique littiraire, Actes simiotiques-Documents, 9 (1987), 10; Geninasca's is the clearest and most concise account of recent developments in literary semiotics inspired by Greimas's work. 12 See Geninasca.</page><page sequence="16">538 NEW LITERARY HISTORY 13 See Fredric Jameson, Foreword, On Meaning, on the problem of reading Greimas, who is perhaps the most difficult and forbidding of the great thinkers and theoreticians of French structuralism and whose works, as Jameson notes, are "bristling with scien- tificity, .... breaking out at all points into that graphics of formalization (equations, schemata, nonverbal symbols of variables and invariables) that always seem to the 'humanist' to draw a boundary across which one looks with frustration at the forbidden and promised lands of mathematics or symbolic logic, or of musical theory" (p. iv). 14 Algirdas Julien Greimas, Du sens: Essais semiotiques (Paris, 1970), p. 15. 15 See Algirdas Julien Greimas, Du sens II: Essais semiotiques (Paris, 1983), p. 11: "The polemico-contractual confrontation that we consider as one of the fundamental orga- nizing structures of the narrative schema is now transposed and established in the very heart of intersubjectivity where it seems to be able to account for the fiduciary, uneasy, groping, and, at the same time, cunning and dominating nature of communication." 16 See Parret, Introduction. 17 Greimas has often stressed the collective nature of the research undertaken over the last twenty years by the "Groupe de recherches s miolinguistiques" in Paris, which has published ninety issues of Actes sbmiotiques-Documents and some forty issues of Actes semiotique-Bulletin, under the editorship of Eric Landowski; see "On Meaning," this issue, n. 3; Jean-Claude Coquet, Semiotique: L'icole de Paris (Paris, 1982); and Parret, Introduction. 18 See, e.g., recent issues of Actes sbmiotiques-Bulletin and Actes sbmiotiques-Documents, as well as Denis Bertrand, L'espace et le sens: "Germinal" d'Emile Zola (Amsterdam, 1985); Jacques Fontanille, Le savoir partagi: Sbmiotique et theorie de la connaissance chez Marcel Proust (Paris, 1987), and Claude Zilberberg, Raison etpodtique du sens (Paris, 1988), in all of which discursive structures and the figurative dimension of texts are explored. 19 See Algirdas Julien Greimas, "Algirdas Julien Greimas: Mise A la question," in Michel Arrive and Jean-Claude Coquet, Simiotique enJeu (Paris, 1987). 20 See my discussion above, pp. 525-27. 21 See Jean Petitot, Morphogenrse du sens (Paris, 1985), and his article "Structure," in Encyclopedic Dictionary of Semiotics (Berlin, 1986), pp. 991-1022. 22 This would, it seems to me, correspond to criticizing Noam Chomsky for being closed to the history of linguistics. 23 Quoted in Parret, Introduction.</page></plain_text>
