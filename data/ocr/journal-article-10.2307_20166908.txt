<plain_text><page sequence="1">The question of the body in Mesoamerican art JAMES ELKINS A teacher of mine?Charles Cohen, a specialist in Venetian painting?once remarked that his principal goal as a scholar was to understand as many of his own biases as possible. That was an odd way for a Renaissance art historian to describe his calling, and it has stayed with me ever since. He could have said that his aim was to understand Renaissance art, and that he kept an eye on the possible influences of his own twentieth-century thinking; but instead he inverted the usual formula and put the search for biases first?almost as if whatever he understood of Renaissance art would be an aftereffect of his introspections. There are many ways to negotiate this dilemma, which is one of the central figures in the epistemology of history. Perhaps the most common formula could be stated as such: What we see in the past is certainly influenced by our own thinking, but we will be steered toward true accounts by remaining faithful to the historical evidence. This stance, or something like it, has been used as a reason to eschew the philosophy of history and "theory" more generally. If the historical facts do not support whatever biases or theories we have?so this argument runs?then we will automatically tend toward more accurate accounts. There are many reasons to doubt this notion, and they all proceed from one general claim that was first articulated by Hegel: theories, he thought, are what guide our apprehension of "facts," so that there is no such thing as a fact free of theory.1 I do not propose to follow this question any further as an abstract philosophic problem; instead, I am interested in how it might be addressed at the level of specific historical inquiry. Recently Mesoamerican studies have come up against a particularly intractable version of this issue as scholars have attempted to define how the Mesoamerican artists conceived the human body. The recent decipherment of Mayan script has revivified an ongoing interest in Mesoamerican sacrifice, and in the past ten years there has been an increasing amount of discussion centered on bloodletting, dismemberment, and symbolic bodily fragmentation. The central critical term of this literature is the represented human body, and its ultimate goal is the description of the characteristically Mesoamerican sense of the body. My purpose is to list several sources of bias that impede and distort our concept of the Mesoamerican body; in particular, I will explore the concepts of bodily fragmentation and pain. Both of those ideas, I will argue, come from nineteenth- and twentieth-century European cultural history, and are inappropriate conceptual tools for the Mesoamerican material. Like Charles Cohen, my primary purpose is to understand what / think about the body, but throughout these remarks I will also be implying that this kind of study is not irrelevant for Mesoamericanists?that the most interesting scholarship is the product of informed study of the artifacts together with reflective inquiry on our own cultural situation. Without the archaeological detail, Mesoamerica becomes speculation; but without cultural self-awareness, it becomes the unnoticed projection of our own ideas. In this form, the problem is applicable to any historical research that finds itself engaging with alien material and at the same time spurning historiographie inquiry. This is a condition not only of historical knowledge but of knowledge in general. It is more corrosive than this description suggests, since "artifacts" and "archaeological detail" are also names for unnoticed projection, so that ultimately there is no contrast between a firm base of facts and the endlessly cycling groundless self-awareness. Any object, qua object, can set this groundless specularity in motion, and no object, qua object, can settle the difference between seeing mind and seen object. But I am not concerned with this kind of speculation on speculation, because it quickly makes history impossible; it is the particular balances and decisions of historical writing that are of interest. In order to remain within history, and to continue to speak about history, we need to agree on questions that cannot be asked; and it seems to me that this is one such moment. It can be helpful to draw attention back to the self-awareness of the historian, but only if the material object can remain as such: perhaps inaccessible, always difficult, but potentially engaging.2 1.

A comprehensive account of body forms in art would encompass?to cite a few prominent examples?questions of representation in AIDS; the entire history of sexism; the philosophy of the gaze, including the problematic of the beholder; the seen and the unseen; and the metaphors of skin, inside and outside that continue to generate so much contemporary art. At the moment it seems premature to try to define this field, although it might be called somatic, or body, criticism.3 The rough outlines of its history are already visible: it began with the gradual devaluation and disuse of the academic study of art anatomy, which had been historians' main tool in discussing the body.4 In another development, historians beginning with Alois Riegl, Robert Vischer, and Adolf Hildebrandt began to speak about the body's interaction with painted bodies,5 and that orientation can be seen today in work by Rosalind Krauss, Michael Fried, and Leo Steinberg.6 With the rise of the history of ideas art historians had access to a much wider field of concepts, and current scholarship is a heady mixture of anthropology, art history, and the histories of culture, philosophy, medicine, and anthropology. Often enough there is a curious disinterest in imposing any order on this nascent field, almost as if it is best served by a certain conceptual incoherence.7 For many writers, the body is an arena with a particular fascination and freedom, especially because it seems to be the strongest available example of a conceptually nomadic field: that is, it appears to have no boundaries, no settled or determinable viewpoint, no canonical exposition.8 In part, that ostensibly uncontained quality is ascribed to the most rudimentary facts of human experience: that our bodies are ourselves and our minds, and so they cannot be separated as we might separate still lifes or landscapes. We often desire to lose ourselves in the midst of a truly disorienting, intractable thicket, and the body gives us that. But that very ambition is a sign of the specific time and place from which we write. Thinking "at" and "around" As a preliminary strategy, it is helpful to ask an especially abstract question: how do we think about thinking about the body? Cecelia Klein has pointed out that we notice, or seem to notice, the Mesoamericans "thinking through" or "with" the body; and that we ourselves might well doubt what we see, and do our own "thinking through" or "rethinking."9 In English there is a curious ?nappropriateness about the prepositions we use with the verb "to think." I can't think of anything I've actually thought entirely through, that is, if I take the construction literally and imagine boring through the problem and coming out on the other end. And when I attack some problem, I certainly don't mean to say I think about it, as if I've missed it entirely, and gone around it. Heidegger solved these problems by deleting the preposition, so that he could use phrases like "Let us think the question of Being." Let me suggest that we distinguish between thinking something, as Heidegger would have said?that is, thinking directly at it, what we normally mean by saying we think about or through?from thinking by means of something. Then the second possibility, thinking by means of something, is what people of any culture do automatically when they read or interpret symbolic images. When I type these words, I do not think of the forms of the letters, and when a Mayan read an inscription, he would presumably not have thought of the bustling activity and incipient violence of the bodily forms that comprise the Mayan glyphs. So in this case, and in part?and I emphasize those qualifications?thinking by means of an image is using 3.

In Mayan studies, for example, we might want to stop inquiring into the apparent violence of fragmented bodies, to stop zeroing in on the place where the thorny string seems to pass through Lady Xoc's tongue in Yaxchilan (fig. 1), to stop requiring the size of blood scrolls to correlate with the volume of blood, to stop using the images to imagine the original smoky scenes of sacrifice and hallucination.11 It is not that native readers would not have seen the blood (although I might recall in passing that these lintels were raised above the level where such details could easily have been seen, especially if they were painted in monochrome); it is that our reading might be inventing lurid scenarios that were not originally lurid, or imagining squeamish pain where none was present?or in general, interpreting a suffering or mutilated body where none was intended. Even if the rope does pass through Lady Xoc's tongue, it may not signify pain, vision, or mutilation. Much more can be said about these possibilities? how a "mutilated" body might also be a whole one, or a perfected one, or how a "suffering" body might also be a natural one, or a healed one?and I will have more to say about them, and about the reasons why we may sometimes want to opt for the radical excision of our reading habits rather than their slow adjustment. But having made this plea for not reading, I want to hasten to point out the opposing possibilities. It is always necessary to ask about the remaining corporeal nuance even in signs so common they are nearly bleached of all naturalistic significance. As Ezra Pound pointed out in the heyday of Imagism, the Chinese sign for "east" is a tree with the sun tangled in its branches. Native speakers of Chinese have assured me that they do not notice pictographic signs in the ordinary course of reading, but they do: they study them in school (Chinese education includes a system of a half-dozen different types of pictographic and ideographic signs, in marked contrast to our Western idea that pictographic and ideographic form a strict opposition), and they know them immediately when the question arises.12 The same may be said of the Mayan glyphs. In Mayan a glyph can be written as an "abstract" form, a "head variant," and a "full-figure variant," all meaning the same thing, and "full-figure" glyphs would certainly have been noticed and appreciated, especially by the highly literate (and incidentally, the question of a sophisticated, "aesthetically aware" avant-garde in Mayan art is one that still needs to be developed).13 And in terms of bloodletting, I doubt the "hand scattering" and "blood group" glyph that denotes bloodletting (a down-turned, opened hand, letting loose a stream of little circles) could have ever been read without a fleeting thought of the body and its blood.14 So what I have in mind is a general caution about what is visible and invisible to the people in a given culture. In terms of contemporary theory, we tend to interpret bodies and body parts when they occur in pictures, and we tend not to interpret bodies when they comprise writing. That distinction is being questioned in current studies on word and images,15 and it bears on the more specific points I want to make about how we use concepts like pain, dismemberment, fragment, part, and whole. 10. Among the many semiotic theories that set out this kind of distinction, see The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, ed. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1965), vol. 2, par. 247-249, for the concepts of "symbolic" and "iconic" signs. The most detailed and also, perhaps, the most conceptually elusive account of the pictorial nature of all writing is Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard's Discour, figure (Paris: Klincksieck, 1971), which is still untranslated. See, for example, Bill Readings, Introducing Lyotard, Art and Politics (London: Routledge, 1991), pp. 3-52. A related essay is my "What Really Happens in Pictures?

Especially in America, this may seem unlikely; but in Europe, Surrealism continues to be the principal strategy for poetry, and in Eastern and Central Europe it is a strong current in visual art. This is particularly the case with French poetry, which comprises a tradition almost hermetically sealed from contemporary Anglo-American poetry. So in considering surrealist influence on our thought, we are not restricting ourselves to some unexpected parochialism or anachronism, but we are considering a living tradition that is both versatile and insinuant. In the case of the body, the Surrealism of George Bataille matters the most, although Roger Caillois's thought would also be influential if it were better known in English (it is significant, incidentally, that Caillois did not illustrate Eye of the Medusa, and that Lacan did not illustrate his lectures on Caillois). I am not suggesting that we would have any problem in freeing ourselves of some of Bataille's ideas if the issue were a direct textual influence. I do not think that current somatic criticism is significantly influenced by his particular ideas concerning ecstasy, redemption, or sacrifice.16 American Mesoamericanists may be more familiar with the diluted Surrealism of popular horror movies and science fiction. But Bataille is the original source for a much more widespread and interesting set of ideas that perhaps comprises a large part of our informal sense of the sacred. When art historians begin speaking about spiritual values?when it becomes apparent that they are talking about questions that concern them personally, that seem to be viable alternates to the largely unbelievable liturgy and ceremony that were practiced by whatever cultures they happen to be studying?then they tend to enlist a small number of ideas. As informally as possible, I would like to list these ideas and propose them as an informal art historical sense of the genuinely transcendental?as a "religion of art history." The ideas include an interest in personal spirituality as opposed to established religion; in mysticism as opposed to scholastic theology; in the body in all its horrific vicissitudes as opposed to the chastized, abstracted, and negated body of Christianity; in negative theology or inchoate belief rather than public credenda; and in corporeal, tangible, or otherwise physicalistic senses of spirit as opposed to the insubstantial and abstract Christian spiritus sancti. These are the skeletal outlines of an informal or unformed consensus of spirituality that is shared, I think, on the one hand by many people interested in contemporary art, including art historians, and on the other by the French surrealists. This is a massive and unwieldy subject precisely because it is inchoate, uncodified, and intensely personal. Usually these ideas are not fully thought through, so that they surface in our texts and then Figure 2. Ling-tschi, Chinese execution by division into a thousand parts, ca. 1920.

An unusually developed example from the art world is Joel-Peter Witkin, whose photographs are partly intended as a project to document what he calls "the sacred"?an idea that for him is strongly expressed by the varieties of human sexuality and suffering. For Witkin, the body, and especially the failing, straining, ecstatic, degenerate, disproportionate, "perverse," malformed, "deviant," mutilated body, is the source and carrier of "the sacred." An indispensible icon in this field is Bataille's photographs of the Chinese execution called ling-tschi, "death by division into a thousand parts." The photographs have not often been reproduced, but they are the centerpiece of Bataille's later thinking on the connections between the fragmented body, redemption, and religious ecstasy (fig. 2). They are also the ultimate record of this attraction to blood and incomprehensible violence, and of its immediately felt connection to "perverse" spiritual exaltation. Several years ago, I discovered a sequence of ling-tschi photographs entirely by chance in a German ethnographic journal, and I thought it was my own scholarly possession until I found Bataille had beat me to it. His engagement with the material, I discovered, was strongly different from mine: he was concerned with explicitly religious values (transfiguration, ecstasy, revelation, vision), while I used the image as an instance of a failure of seeing?of an image that we cannot easily see. In other words, I echoed the cognitive, philosophical apect of Bataille's interest without taking up the actively religious purpose. To me, the sequences of the ling-tschi (mine are all slightly different from Bataille's, suggesting a common source) have resonance with the current art historical discourse on the gaze and on related questions of deflected and forbidden seeing and blindness. The experience of discovering Bataille's appropriation in Tears of Eros eventually taught me about my own position in intellectual history and my partial adherence to a tradition I had only vaguely suspected. It is not a simple project to trace the influence of an author and a movement that are only vaguely present in our memories. But Surrealism in general is one of the central forces in our thinking, and it directs us toward the sacrificial and spiritual aspects of bloodletting. Surrealist thought blends with contemporary private spiritualism to produce the mixture of thoughts that lead us to confront the disrupted body: and with that general observation, I turn to the central topic of this paper? the ways we understand the specific transformations of the Mesoamerican body. What is fragmentation? The word "fragment" itself is charged, since it comes from Latin frangere, to break, implying violence and pain. But the history of bodily representations does not always accord with this etymology, even when it gives us incomplete bodies. There are various ways of disassembling the body?for instance, by being coy about its wholeness, obscuring it, veiling and clothing it. In addition the body is divided differently in each culture, and that question is especially complex in Western art with its alternate traditions of articulated and divided metrologies. Albrecht D?rer saw the body in harmonious proportions, in fractions, in orthogonal</page><page sequence="7">Elkins: The question of the body in Mesoamerican art 119 dimensions, in a butcher's articulations, and on a minutely divided, ruled scale, and he worked with a specific imaginative dramatis personae of unideal and ?deal body types, gestures, poses, and ages (fig. 3). All of that is his idea of the body?or, to be more accurate, the formal portion of his idea of the body?and artists with views as similar to D?rer as Martin Schongauer saw things differently. Wholeness and fragmentation cannot be evoked as generalizations without making inadvertent use of particular cultural constructions of those terms, most often derived from twentieth-century studio art pedagogy. There is an overarching distinction that is sometimes helpful here, and that is between acts of fragmentation involving pain and those that entrance us intellectually.17 The visceral and the intellectual are often opposed possibilities in representation as they are in art. Most recently, in our culture, Surrealism has explored ways to painlessly disassemble bodies in the most intricately bizarre fashions, and expressionism has shown us the squirming discomfort, itching and twisting pain that we recognize as expressions of psychic unrest (the psychomachia). This is often enough a generative dichotomy: to take Mesoamerican examples, it describes the difference between our Western fascination with the "violated" body, its "fragmentation," and its "lurid" sacrifice on the one hand, and its routine, symbolic disarticulation on the other. At the moment, our own culture is at an interesting crossroads: on the one hand, we inherit the painlessness of surrealist fantasy, and on the other, there is a sharply increasing bibliography of pain and its treatment.18 Among the many instances of painless metamorphosis are the "abstract" figures at Teotihuacan that blend so well into nontheriomorphic architectural details.19 One of the most grotesque Mayan practices, even worse than the penis perforations and the thorned ropes that may have been dragged through or along women's tongues, apparently involved ripping the jaw off a living victim.20 But the figures that seem to show that practice are as bloodless as can be: they merely show captives, with hands on their jaws (fig. 4).

Doesn't the apparently decadent, hypersensitive "Painter of the Prancing Deer" convey heated, irritable absorption in the body, even though he or she does not depict bodily mutilation (fig. 5)?21 Part and whole A principal origin of the modern sense of pain is early German Romanticism.22 It is, I think, directly relevant that the same period gave rise to the fascination about the fragment. Since Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling's work in particular, it has been attractive to speak about the part, the disconnected piece, rather than the whole. We tend to think about fragments and by means of fragments, and it has even been remarked that our sense of the concept of beauty now needs to be considered in terms of "shards and fragments."23 There are several observations that might be made here. Esther Pasztory has remarked on the fragmentation of bodies at Teotihuacan, among both sacrifical victims (who are reduced to their hearts) and gods (who appear as mouths, claws, and eyes); and she opposes those representations to the anonymous rows of figures representing the ruling class. She sees the hearts as "cosmic and timeless" rather than "human and historic," the gods as "active" and "pervasive" in the natural world, and the elite as self-effacing manipulators of the created world.24 There is an interesting moment when Pasztory says that depictions of eyes in Teotihuacan "appear simply to belong to water and nature in general." They are as naturally and painlessly fragmented as flowing water. But if they belong to water?if they serve to "suggest that water is alive and all-seeing"?then they are in a sense also not fragments. And if one body part, cut off from the body to which it might belong, is not to be conceived as a fragment, then it becomes riskier to assume that the victims' hearts are fragments. Might a heart not be a whole? Might it not be a coveted essence, an indispensible and sufficient token, like the piles of foreskins King David required from his generals? There is some evidence of this in the fact that the hearts are rendered in three dimensions even though Teotihuacan style is "generally flat." Hearts may be wholes, and it may be our Western eyes that keep thinking of them as organs.25 Since the ruling class give themselves the only whole bodies, she concludes that their world was itself "fragmented." This is again a question of parts and wholes. What part belongs in a whole? Does every heart belong in a chest? Can't a whole be a fragment? And isn't every line of identical rulers a geometric shard of the overall scheme of the represented world of Teotihuacan? One of the most reflective recent accounts of this problem is Whitney Davis's Masking the Blow.26 Speaking of canonical Egyptian art, and quoting an earlier study he had written, he remarks that "register compositions" (rows of more or less identical figures sharing a "register ground line") might be said to "be a means of claiming the 'registered' organization of the world ... as a truth or as an ideal by representing it as a fact of experience."27 That seems to be a plausible interpretation, and it is closely related to the one Esther Pasztory proposes; but Davis goes on to say that it is necessary to think also of what the register compositions "do not depict through substitutions and suppressions." An image might represent a thing, or 21.

In the case at hand, the rows of the elite at Teotihuacan might also be repressions of a sense of fragmentation that they project onto their world and violently enact on their subjects?that would be an instance of substituting what cannot be depicted, in this case inner "fragmentation"?or the figures may be suppressing differences and even "fragmentations" among their apparently uniform ranks, in order to present a solid appearance, which would be a case of "masking" what is deemed unwise to show directly. These possibilities, which I have elaborated from Davis's account, are just a few of an indeterminate number of ways that the rows of uniform elite might come to be seen as parts, and the hearts might come to be wholes. I should say that I am not proposing any one of these readings, and in fact I find Pasztory's reading provocative and convincing. But our concepts are our own in any interpretation, and they will often lead us without revealing themselves. A schema like Davis's has the distinct advantage of opening other possibilities; some of them, inevitably, will not seem right, but their logical equivalence can set us thinking about how we employ concepts such as "part" and "whole." Close reading By way of concluding, I would like to sketch the kind of investigation that is needed to bring us closer to the solution of these problems. What is called for, I believe, is a genuinely close reading of the exact ways the body is treated: precisely where it is cut, exactly where it touches the surrounding glyphs or bodies or frames.28 Western treatment of the body is exceedingly complex, and all the evidence suggests that the same is true of the Mesoamerican body; but without attending as closely as we are able, we are likely to pour new wine into the old bottles of Western concepts of the body. The Aztec material, for example, is especially rich, but the persistence of Western perspectives has shown itself in the Western schemata that have been used to house the N?huatl terms.29 The Mayan material may not seem as fundamentally disorienting as the Central Mexican material where a body part may be an ideograph, a figure, an attribute, "or even a suggestion of the setting," and a linguistic sign might be "embedded" in an ?mage; but the initially clearer separation of pictorial figure and pictorial writing in Mayan art raises even more delicate questions of the nature of the body.30 28. This is related to the question of word and image as discussed in Arthur G. Miller, "Comparing Maya Image and Text," in Word and Image in Maya Culture, ed. William F. Hanks and Don S. Rice (Salt Lake City: Univ. of Utah Press, 1989), pp. 176-188. 29.

If the syllable pa is depicted as a full-figure glyph, it is known as the"pa-man." In one instance, the pa-man picks up the other two syllables and holds them, forming an image with the same linguistic denotation but an entirely transformed pictorial significance.31 The shape and some of the form of the remaining syllables are altered when they are "carried" in this way. Let me make a few disconnected observations about the pictorial goings-on here in order to suggest what kinds of interpretation are possible. A Mayanist might not care that the ts'a sign is slightly different when it is carried by the "pa-man" (the formal alterations do not affect syntactic meaning, and they do not denote the state of being carried). But to an eye that is used to corporeal changes, the transformation the ts'a sign undergoes when it is to be carried may be read as a response to its new pictorial setting?I might say, its shape is changed when it takes on some of the significance of a picture. (In Peirce's "semeiotic" theory, the ts'a syllable glyph undergoes a slight graphic change when it shifts from a mostly symbolic sign to a combined symbolic and iconic sign.)32 Likewise, a Mayan scholar might not notice that the pa-sign's long hooked nose looks like a hook that forms part of the ha syllabic sign, but in pictorial terms that visual rhyme gives the pa-man a kind of linguistic significance: the hooked nose's slant rhyme makes the pictorial body more textual; to put it in the hybrid language it deserves, we might say the hooked nose is a kind of "infix" in its own right. Pictorially, the entire full-figure glyph block and the very idea of a part of a word holding other parts of a word expresses containment and engastration as well as "setting upright," and so the pictorial performs a kind of unnecessary metaphoric enactment of the linguistic. Much more could be said along these lines, since the slightly varying lines, dots, and curves in each sign follow a complex pictorial logic that is not entirely assimilable to the linguistic requirements, though it cannot be understood apart from them. There is no study on these "pictorial" or "graphological" elements?the morphemes or "elements" in David Kelley's term33?of the Protean Mayan signary, since Mayanists are still engrossed in deciphering linguistic meanings.34 In this context let me propose that these questions constitute a huge unopened field, and that there is no way to separate the ongoing problems of "word and ?mage" in Mayan studies from the question of the body. The "elements" of these signs carry pictorial meaning within, before, and despite their linguistic functions, and the most minute laws of their form and combination are linked to laws about the body. To close, the plethora of Mayan monsters that have been identified in the past few decades have yet to receive an analysis that would provide us with the laws of bodily change. Decapitation and bloodletting are only the simplest operations, especially when they are compared to the nearly incomprehensible convolutions of the pre-Peten anthropomorphic "bird monsters,"35 the "Cauac Monster" or the "Curl-Formed Monster,"36 or the "sky-band" body of the Celestial Monster.37 The fact that we cannot yet name all the parts of such monsters should not deter us from attempting a more myopic analysis of the bewildering ars combinatoria of their parts. These monsters may operate on principles close to the Western gryllus, which is the traditional monstrosity composed of nameable body parts from various animals (sphinxes, griffins, and centaurs are ready examples).38 But there are other principles at work in Mesoamerican images: there are also continuous, Catherine Berlo, "Early Writing in Central Mexico: In Tlilli, In Tlapalli Before a.D. 1000," esp. p. 19, both in Richard A.

Do we really have any sense of when and why the "rear head of a Vision Serpent" might be connected by a "skeletal dragon" (the thin S-shaped scroll) to "personified blood"?40 Even where the symbolic sense is becoming clear, the logic of the body is elusive. And these are not the only modes of "fragmentation"; another that is at least as prominent is the iterated occlusions formed by bodies in front of bodies or bodies swallowing bodies. In ceramics this way of thinking about bodies has led to some of the most intricate creations; in some of them a composition must have been planned in advance and then formed by laying down successive layers of material, trellis fashion, producing a texture that almost amounts to a woven fabric.41 In other cases the compositions are painted directly on the vessels, and I will close with one such example. The very detailed analyses undertaken by Nicholas Hellmuth in the course of his discovery of what he calls the "Underwaterworld" have been well brought to bear on one of the more intricate Mayan pieces, an incised tripod bowl (two details are shown in fig. 6).42 It has a bewildering variety of "acrobats," "snake monsters," gods, and others, in undecidable states of twining and occlusion. In one place, a figure appears half-stuck in a dragon's mouth (fig. 6, top right). Its right leg is above it, and the forms just under and in front of its chin might be elbows. Hellmuth annotates the form in front of the mouth with a question ("probably an arm?") and calls the other an "unidentified body part."43 Certainly the figure is not normally articulated, but is it dismembered? Is it unfolding, and being regurgitated, or is it collapsing, disappearing into the dragon's mouth? These kinds of iconographie questions cannot be answered until we have a better formal account of the possibilities of bodily transformation. What constitutes a "whole body" here? What is a "fragment"? Is the hatched, incomplete "elbow" more fragmentary than the decorated "elbow" or the leg? Is the figure one body and the dragon another? And if so, how do we outline the dragon, since its body is only inconsistently visible and distinct from other forms? When two forms coalesce, what is the difference between ordinary optical occlusion, decorative exigency, and symbolic union? Hellmuth concludes a thorough account by saying that the artist has made use of "skeletalization, metamorphosis . . . visual and linguistic puns . . . [and] deliberate ambiguity and 'incompleteness' to create the confusing palimpsest of figures." Hellmuth puts "incompleteness" in quotation marks, as I would, but there remains the underlying question of the influence of Western thinking on the analysis as a whole. What are "skeletalization" and "metamorphosis" but quintessential^, intractably Western concepts? Exactly what constitutes a "pun"? Does the figure's decorated leg pun with the dragon's spotted jaw? And is the coincidence of "comparable markings" on the figure and the dragon enough to say that the figure is "metamorphosing into a part-reptile, part-human state," or should we conclude, as Hellmuth also does, that he is merely "held"?44 Before we can decide this, we need to decide how to construe terms such as "pun" and "comparable." Is the curl of the dragon's teeth a sufficient pun with the figure's hair? What is needed is a detailed, inch-by-inch look at the images, paired with an historiographie inquiry that tries to find and understand the Western etymologies of our critical terms. Neither strategy alone is sufficient. A theoretical inquiry into the origins and meaning of concepts such as fragmentation, wholeness, or pain cannot make contact with the works, and a myopic but untheoretical analysis will only rehearse unnoticed Western categories of thought. In the end there is no guarantee that we can see outside our accustomed sense of the body, or retrieve something of the Mesoamerican body. Charles Cohen's maxim is an ongoing responsibility, not a task that has some determinate method and limit. But self-reflection and attention to troublesome details are particularly effective ways to upset our ingrained thinking and bring out the persistent strangeness of the images. 40.
