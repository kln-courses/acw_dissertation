The Colloquium, reflecting the Center's multifaceted agenda, is an eclectic program that attempts to foster interdisciplinary and international scholarly dialogue concerning the intellectual and social infrastructure of science and mathematics from all historical periods and from diverse cultures. All lectures are open to the public. Selected proceedings of the Colloquium appear in the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science [Kluwer Academic Publishers; a list is available from the Center]. In addition, the Center sponsors postgraduate Research Fellows, who have come from thirty-five countries. Alfred I. Tauber, Director; Robert S. Cohen, Director Emeritus.
