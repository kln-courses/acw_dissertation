During World War II, Americans found themselves lacking in rubber for all purposes, as Japan controlled 90 percent of the world's rubber supply, and American- made synthetic rubber proved inferior to the natural product. As early as 1907, experiments by the Intercontinental Rubber Company were conducted on gu- ayule, a Mexican desert shrub that contained 20 percent pure rubber that lent itself to harvesting. The International Rubber Company soon began to breed the plant to produce double that amount of rubber. After harvesting, the plant was sent to a mill for production, where it was compressed into molds for shipment. The Salinas Valley was host to commercial operations on a large scale, begun in 1926 by the Intercontinental Rubber Company. Eight thouLsand acres of guaytule were under cultivation and up to five tons of guayule rubber were turned out daily. After a paper published by Intercontinental Rubber's vice president, Dr. David Spence, outlined how the United States could not become dependent on foreign supplies, the War Department sent two majors (one of whom was Dwight D. Eisenhower) to investigate the Salinas operation. After the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, the</page><page sequence="33">174 Environmental History federal government passed the Emergency Rubber Project Act in 1942 and took over Intercontinental's operations in Salinas, creating the Guayule Rubber Project, un- der the direction of the United States Forest Service. Nurseries were established for the Salinas plant near Bakersfield, Oceanside, and Indio, California, and in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. By 1944, 32,ooo acres were devoted to the growing of guayule. The end of World War II and the improvement of synthetic rubber meant the end of the guayule project in the Salinas Valley. After 1945, the Salinas land was turned over to the production of other crops. (Source: Verardo, Jennie Dennis, and Denzil Verardo. The Salinas Valley: An Illuistrated History.

In 1974, Hart again ran for the State Assembly and this time was successful. He served there from 1975 until 1982. His most notable legislative accomplishments were in the areas of education and envi- ronmental protection. He was the principal co-author of major state bond measures for open space and park acquisitions, and authored California's landmark solar tax credit legislation, which quickly established California as the leading state promot- ing solar energy. In 1982, Hart became the State Senator representing portions of Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties. Hart authored an important endangered species bond measure, the first of its kind in state history, and consis- tently ranked at the top of state environmental organizations who rated the voting records of state legislators. In 1988, Hart ran for the igth U.S. Congressional District seat but lost to the incumbent. He was able to maintain his seat in the California Senate. Hart was re-elected to the Senate in 1990 and served until 1994.

The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 called for the establishment of a committee that would council and advise the secretary of agriculture during the development of national forest management planning regu- lations, as required by the NFMA. In April 1977, Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz appointed a nuLmber of forestry professors and government researchers to the USDA Committee of Scientists (COS). Arthur W.

Stark, Lucille F. Stickel, Dennis E. Teeguarden, William Webb, and Earl L. Stone, Jr. From 1977 to 1979, the COS held a number of meetings and drafted a series of proposed regulations for multiple-use management of U.S. national forests.

The Reagan administration briefly reconvened the members of the commit- tee as a panel of experts in the early 1980s for the purpose of reviewing and possibly limiting national forest management regtulations, btut the panel tirged that the regtulations written by the COS remain in effect, and no changes were made to the NFMA regulations. The Cooper Papers are comprised of materials that the Coi- mittee of Scientists either constulted or generated in its review of national forest management planning regtulations, primarily dturing the period from 1977 to 1979.

Joel Palmer, pioneer leader and author, was born October 4, 1810, in Ontario, Canada. As a young man in 1836, he moved to Indiana and worked on the canals. In 1843 and 1845, he served as a representative in the Indiana legislature. During the spring of 1845, Palmer started overland to Oregon. During his journey he kept a diary of his experiences, which was published in 1847 as Jotrnal of Travels over the Rocky Mountains. This publica- tion served as a guidebook to immigrants for information on equipment and route details. The next year he returned to Indiana and made a second trip back to Oregon. He served as commissary-general of volunteer forces in the Cayuse War, and as peace emissary to persuade neighboring tribes not to join the Cayuse Indi- ans. After the war, Palmer left for California and upon his return laid out the town of Dayton in Yamhill County, where he filed his donation land claim and built a sawmill. In 1853, he became superintendent of Indian affairs for the Oregon Terri- tory. Serving with distinction, Palmer had the difficult task of securing Oregon lands from warring Indian tribes while preventing the outbreak of hostilities. Dur- inlg his tenure, he negotiated nine treaties of cessation. He was removed as superin- tendent in 1857 for purstuing too lenient an Indian policy. He served as speaker of the Oregon HouLse of Representatives in 1862 and state senator, 1864-1868. In 1870, Palmer was defeated as the Reptublican candidate for governor. He died June 9, i88i, in Dayton, Oregon. Papers include: Correspondence (1848-1869) of Joel Palmer concerning the conduLct of Indian affairs in Oregon, enlistment of a state militia, and efforts to establish a Union League Council.
