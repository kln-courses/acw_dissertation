<plain_text><page sequence="1">news from our chapters' Atlanta In February, the chapter visited the Atlanta National Wîather Ser vice (NWS) Forecast Office for a closer look at Atlanta's Auto mation of Field Operations and Services ( AFOS) and the rest of the NWS facilities. Meteorologist-in-Charge Carlos Garza and NWS staffers Charlie Matthews, Marvin Maddox, John Laing, and Claude Hall demonstrated various segments of the Atlanta oper ations: computer-worded forecasts,- warnings and how they're composed and distributed to the media; aviation weather ser vices; and public weather services.—Nancy Wright, Secy./Treas. Central North Carolina The chapter met 17 November 1983 at the National Institute of Environmental and Health Statistics, and discussed the NOAA sponsored Booz-AJlen-Hamilton report, "National Wfeather Ser vice: A Strategy and Organizational Concept for the Future." The discussion was led by a panel consisting of Joe Pellissier (NWS), Mike Modrick (WRAL-TV, representing the media), Walt Bach (ARO, representing the private sector), and Dave Barker (NCSU, academia). Hersch Slater (retired) served as moderator. Although no attempt was made to arrive at a concensus on any aspect of the report, some issues were highlighted. The group agreed that the report's publication and wide distribution may have an overall positive effect for meteorology. It created a vehicle for self-criticism. A program to automate surface observations appears feasible. Because of the long implementation phase, the panel thought little personnel impact is likely. Concurrently, opportunities would develop for private sector activities in developing, installing, and maintaining observing systems. The proposed organization and responsibilities of the forecast activities would likely insulate the forecaster and the public, which would erode feedback from the user and degrade credibility that is essential for a viable forecasting service. Similarly, the media, though expected to be the primary forecast and warning dissemination medium, would simultaneously have less access to NWS. The report says little about the functions of people, so the impact on educational programs is most unclear. The implications are, however, that meso-scale phenomena need more attention, and greater exposure of budding meteorologists to business adminis tration and communication programs would be in order. Demand for training in installation and maintenance of the communica tion, sensor and display systems is likely. Major deficiencies in the report that have research implica tions included: 1) the dependence on the profilers as a replace ment for the RAOB was considered to be an unacceptable risk; 2) the proposals ignore the needs for climatic data; and 3) the pro posals tailor NWS around forecast models in current use—a sit uation which may dampen research. 'Meeting reports received at headquarters before 15March 1984 are included. Copy from chapter representatives should be typed double-spaced and submitted to the News Editor in duplicate.— News Ed. Bulletin American Meteorological Society Bob Muller, Meteorologist-in-Charge (MIC), National Wfeather Service (NWS) Raleigh, spoke at the 8 December meeting. He was the the meteorologist on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Disaster Survey Tfeam for Hurricane Alicia which struck Galveston Island, Tfex., 17 August 1983. He presented a comprehensive and well-illustrated review of the météorologie, geographic, and demographic circumstances and alluded to the political interplay that was faced by weather officials. The 1983 hurricane season in the Atlantic and Gulf was the quietest in 40 years. However, one storm, Alicia, caused a record two billion dollars in damage. Of the 21 deaths, five were caused directly by Alicia, and of those five, four were due to falling trees. No deaths occurred on Galveston Island, where a hurricane killed 6000 people in 1900. The average wind exceeded 80 kph for more than one hour, gusting up to 185 kph at times. The storm surge reached 2.5-3 m. The 4.5 m sea wall protected Galveston City from the surge which wiped out two unprotected towns on the western end of the island. Wind damage in the city was extensive. The warning and general performance of the NWS was consid ered excellent by the public, state, and local officials. The news media praised NWS for its role in the emergency. The National Hurricane Center's hurricane probability procedure was extremely useful. The public understood the relative threat involved, and generally took appropriate measures. Tfexas does not have a mandatory evacuation law, as does North Carolina. Alicia developed and struck in about 48 h, which is the minimum warning time necessary to completely evacuate the 80 000-120 000 people on the island. The sole evacuation route is one causeway. A storm similar in intensity to Alicia would be disastrous if it ever struck the North Carolina coast. There is no sea wall behind which to hide, total evacuation is impossible, and structures could be expected to have the same unsafe features that were so prevalent on Galveston Island. At the 19 January 1984chapter meeting, Chairman Gerry Watson commended Dick Jones for his excellent weather presentation to an elementary school on behalf of AMS. He also thanked Rod Gonski for the outstanding newsletter for January. Robert Lamb, Research Meteorologist in the Meteorology and Assessment Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), gave a thought-provoking presentation entitled, "Air Qual ity Modeling: Predictability, Limitations, and Hopes for the Future." One of the questions facing the modeling community is, "How should the emissions of oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons be altered so that ground-level concentrations of ozone will not exceed 0.12 ppm for 1 h?" He argued that this question is funda mentally an engineering problem. Traditionally, engineers look to empirical formulations to solve their problems. However, empirical approaches, though appropriate and often highly suc cessful for specific problems with limited scope, lack generality. Air quality modeling is now in an analogous circumstance. The problems currently faced are of such scope that they cannot be addressed by the empirical formulations that were developed for specific problems two and three decades ago. There are no empirical bases for the ozone problems, so current research is falling back on basic theoretical concepts for regional modeling of problems like ozone distribution and acid rain. How ever, in applying the fundamental physical laws to these prob 509</page><page sequence="2">510 lems; the researcher immediately faces the difficulty that the state of the atmosphere cannot be specified in complete detail from a finite set of measurements; because as a dynamical system, the atmosphere possesses infinite degrees of freedom. This matter is the limiting circumstance to the much-sought-for deterministic solution. To alleviate this situation, Lamb described an analytical approach termed, "expectation of events." It is a procedure com monly used in engineering and one which might apply to air qual ity evaluation and impact analyses. A simple example might be a long range transport problem. The problem might be attacked with a process for rationally choosing a few most probable trajec tories from an ensemble of innumerable trajectories. He proposed that a Lagrangian regional climatology be developed which could provide data to choose most likely trajectories under given mete orological conditions. Sandia National Laboratory, with funding from the EPA, is actively developing a balloon system which will enable 3-dimensional trajectories to be specified. A Lagrangian climatology could be based on an appropriate set of such trajectory data. Summarizing, Lamb indicated that some problems of relating sources to air quality are beyond the reach of modeling. He sug gested that innovative tracer techniques using isotopes or spe cially designed balloons, for example, might be used to acquire empirical descriptions of source-receptor relationships for cer tain air pollutants over regional-scale areas. These data would pro vide a solid basis for regulatory decisions, and coupled with the oretical models, they would provide much more useful and credible information on air pollutants than one could hope to acquire from theoretical models alone. Tom Wallsten, Professor of Psychology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, spoke on "Probability Forecasts: The Com munication of Uncertain Information," at the 16 February meet ing. He described his experiments with the public's interpretation of probability words. He pointed out that the National Weather Service (NWS| assigns numerical percentages to specific verbal terms and phrases that are used in public forecasts. But how are the phrases perceived by the public ? Surveys show that the public places a broad range of interpretations on most probability terms. Murphy and Brown, with whom Wallsten has collaborated, have again shown this (November 1983 Bulletin, p. 1283). The ques tion: Is this circumstance due to the wide variations in the mean ings of the words or to the wide differences in the interpretation of their meanings by the public? Wallsten impressed the members with the detail and care necessary in his experiments if meaningful data are to be obtained. Chapter members were the subject of one of his studies in November 1983. He found in most of his studies that: 1) individual's interpreta tions of probability phrases are relatively stable over time and in contexts; 2) interpretations of phrases vary widely among differ ent individuals; 3) a subset of phrases exists which many individ uals rank the same way; and 4) the specification of a context increases the variability of interpretation. He concluded that: 1) numerical terms are a clearer way to communicate than prob ability phrases, but not all aspects of public forecasts should be numerical; 2| numerical phrases should be used where the com munication of the degree or extent of uncertainty is important, e.g., hurricane land-fall estimates; 3) research can suggest which forecast formats are most useful, preferred or remembered; and 4| research may indicate which phrases are least confusing. Lamb also suggested that in many aspects of human endeavor, probabi listic terms are sometimes usefully ambiguous. Most experi enced forecasters would agree.—Heischel H. Slater, Secy. Vol. 65, No. 5, May 1984 Denver-Boulder "The New Colorado Avalanche Information Center and Ava lanche Forecasting" was the topic of the 31 January meeting held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesa Laboratory in Boulder. Knox Williams, lead forecaster of the Col orado Avalanche Information Center, related that Colorado leads the nation in avalanche-related deaths since 1950. After 10 years, the Colorado center has been shifted from primarily Forest Ser vice funding to a coalition currently consisting of several federal, state, and private agencies. The Center operates from November to April, and issues warnings on an average of 46 days per year. Since the number of fatalities is steadily increasing, particularly due to back-country climbers and ski tourers, more states have followed the example of Colorado and have similar warnings and information programs in operation. A long series of questions fol lowed this very interesting presentation. The chapter held a joint meeting 22 February with with the Front Range Chapter of the American Geophysical Union. Thomas McKee of Colorado State University spoke on "Twentieth Cen tury Climate Variations in Colorado." McKee related that it is fre quently difficult to distinguish between climate change and cli mate variability (natural fluctuations) in dealing with the public. Particular interest in extreme cold was generated by December 1983 in Colorado; only a few months at any time of the year have been colder statewide, and this month was more than 3 standard deviations below normal. Perhaps because of the mountainous terrain, McKee has not found any precipitation variations with widespread areal extent or statistical significance since 1900; nor have any of the longer-term temperature oscillations that have been found over the Northern Hemisphere been detected in Colorado. However, the climate in Colorado is more variable in recent years than earlier in this century.—Ronald L. Holle, Vice Pres. Farthest North The arctic front was the topic for the 27 January meeting—rather appropriate since the temperature outside was -42°C with visi bility of 0.41 k in ice fog. President Richard Hoopes led a round table discussion of the operational significance, 3-dimensional structure, and analysis techniques related to the arctic front. In the Tanana Valley in Interior Alaska, location of the arctic frontal zone is important in forecasting low cloud and snow events. A southward moving arctic front is one of the more frequent snow producers in the valley. It was agreed that initial location and fore casts of frontal movement are complicated by sparse data to the north. Also, the winter radiation inversion often masks the loca tion of the deeper arctic air when surface temperatures are used alone. Only by aggressive analysis of upper air data can the approx imate frontal zone be located. Hoopes also discussed his paper, "Mesoscale Profile of an Arc tic Front," coauthored by Robert E. Fischer. Hoopes described how the slope and vertical extent of the frontal zone was investigated during a special flight from Fairbanks, north to Five Mile Camp. The front can be an active weather producer even in non-winter months.—Dale L. Johnson, Secy.-Treas. Hampton Roads The third chapter meeting of the 1983-1984 year was held at the Fort Monroe Officers Club on 18 January 1984. The speaker for</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin American Meteorological Society 511 the evening was Irwin Kaplan of Systems and Applied Science, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center. His speech was on the MASS/TASS Mesoscale Numerical Modeling System at the Center and its application to coastal cyclone systems. MASS is a mesoscale atmospheric simulation system used to develop a 36-h real-time forecast capability over North America. This model involves inviscid hydrostatic diabatic Navier Stokes equations and detailed numerical techniques, including higher order space differencing and predictor-corrector time marching. TASS is a terminal area simulation system utilizing a non hydrostatic, compressible, unsteady set of governing equations. The model equations include prognostic equations for momen tum, pressure, potential temperature, water vapor, cloud water and ice, rain and hail. The equations are approximated by second order quadratic-conservation space differences and a second-order Adams-Bashforth time marching. Following the presentation, Earl Kindle of Old Dominion University remarked that Kaplan's research was a significant breakthrough in an area that continues to baffle the LFM.—Peter Weigand, Secy. Indiana Following the business portion of the 17 November meeting, Dennis McCarthy, a Lead Forecaster with the National Wfeather Service Forecast Office (NWSFO) in St. Louis, spoke on four north west flow (NWF) severe weather outbreaks which occurred in the Central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley in July of 1980,1981, and 1982. Particular attention was given to satellite imagery of these outbreaks. Each case began with convection, often having a convective cluster appearance, beginning over Kansas or north em Missouri. Warm, moist flow from the south and southwest at 850 and 700 mb, with westerly flow of 10, combined with a weak trough at 500 mb, characterized the flow aloft in the area of con vective activity. As the activity built, it propagated to the south east at approximately 50 kt. Surface wind speeds associated with the storms reached 80-160 kph. During the height of the out break, the temperature-enhanced satellite imagery showed a steep temperature gradient in the inflow area in the southeast portion of the storm. As the activity weakens, this temperature image becomes more concentric in appearance. Ron Przybylinski added a presentation of radar images of sim ilar severe weather events. The maximum echo tops were shown to be along the leading edge of the activity and it was noted that the leading edge gradient was very similar in appearance to the satellite temperature imagery—Michael Kennedy, Secy.-Treas. Kansas City On 8 February 1984, the chapter held a joint meeting with the midwest section of the Air Pollution Control Association ( APCA] at the Adams-Mark Hotel. The topic for the evening, acid precip itaton, was highlighted by a screening of the controversial Cana dian film "Acid Rain: Requium or Recovery." A panel discussion followed the film's presentation. Panel members included Gil Fuller, Empire District Electric Company; Jim Ameson, representing the local chapterof the Siena Club; and Rick Pershall, Missouri Department of Natural Resources. The diverse views of the three panelists generated a great deal of debate. Fuller objected to the film on several points. His main conten tion was that the hydrogen ion (pH) levels used in the film's lab oratory experiments were far more acidic than those found any where in nature. He also disagreed with the movie's claim that the pH of rain is 5.6, arguing that rain typically varies between 4.5 and 5.6 in pH, depending upon prevailing meteorological, sea sonal and. geographical conditions. Furthermore, he said, even values as low as 4.0 are not necessarily of anthropomorphic origin. Fuller went on to say that scientists have yet to document a case in which forest damage has been directly linked to acid precipi tation, and that it is still not certain that utility-generated sulphur and nitrous oxide emissions are the leading cause of acid rain. Finally, Fuller noted that the surface wasting (exfoliation) of masonry structures is not due solely to acid precipitation, as the movie suggested. Jim Arneson, on the other hand, thought that the film accu rately portrayed the acid precipitation problem. He quoted sources estimating that acid rain costs the United States at least five bil lion dollars annually... with nearly half of that due to building damage alone. He expressed his support of House Bill 3400 which would reduce sulphur dioxide emissions over the next 15 years by 50%. This bill would also require the installation of "scrubbers" at the 50 dirtiest power plants across the country and would, according to Ameson, at least be a major step in the right direction. Arneson was particularily concerned with acid rain's leaching effect on toxic metals held in the soil. He ended his presentation with the warning that "... we must tackle the acid precipitation problem now, while we still have some foresight, for soon it will be too late." Rick Pershall, though, favored a more conservative approach. He stressed that money, like the environment, is a resource that must be managed wisely. In other words, acid precipitation con trol measures of any type must be cost-effective. Research has yet to provide answers to many of the most important questions regarding acid rain's causes and effects. Therefore, he concluded, heavy investment in acid precipitation control cannot be justified until more concrete data is at hand. In the meantime, Pershall suggested the use of low-sulphur coal and intensified research as the sensible approach for the remain der of the 80s.—Stephen Coifidi, Secy.-Treas. Memphis The chapter met 10 January 1984 at the WHBQ-TV studios. Roy Degan, a Republic Airlines pilot and member of the Winston Recovery Tfeam, was the guest speaker. Degan explained how the Winston Recovery Ifeam is attempt ing to recover vintage World War II aircraft lost on Greenland dur ing the war. The missing aircraft include six P38Fs and two B17s that crash-landed on the Southeast Coast of Greenland. The air craft were returning to Sndre Strmfjord, Greenland, when they encountered a violent cold front. The pilots picked up a false radio beacon, went off course, ran out of fuel, and were forced to crash land on a flat stretch of snow. The 25 crew members spent ten days there before being rescued by coast guard cutter and dog sled. After researching the history of the event, Degan and a friend felt they could locate the planes. In the summer of 1981 they located one of the aircraft with a magnetometer. The R.J. Reynolds Company then agreed to underwrite the recovery effort, a move that was the genesis of the Winston Recovery Team. Loran Equipment was brought to the site in 1983, but a radar unit belonging to a University of Iceland professor finally pin pointed the eight aircraft. Unfortunately, it was determined that the planes were encased in about 25 m of snow. The R. J.Reynolds Company is deciding at this time whether or not to continue the recovery efforts. The planes are worth about $2 000 000. Between $500 000and$750 000 has already been spent to locate them and</page><page sequence="4">512 Vol. 65, No. 5, May 1984 COMPUTERIZED Met One now offers the interface between meteoro logical sensors ond o personal computer to provide a complete, automatic weather station.

Numerous slides were shown illustrating the extremes of weather on Greenland. Degan's log showed that the highest tem perature recorded was 5°C. Winds were clocked at greated than 100 mph during a couple of storms.—Christopher P. Jansen, Secy. Northern California Chapter The fifth meeting of the 1983-84 year was held at Stanford Research International (SRI), Menlo Park, Calif., on 16 February 1984. Hugh Ellsaesser, from the Physics Department at the UC Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, provided a different view of the green-house problem in his talk, "Climatic Effects of C02 and Volcanic Ash." On 19 May, the chapter is joining the Monterey Peninsula, Sac ramento, and San Jose State University (Student) chapters in host ing a "40th Anniversary of the D-Day Forecast" program.—Milt Sipple, Secy. Twin Cities On 17 November, the chapter met at the Control Data Corpora tion Small Business Center in downtown Minneapolis. Chapter Vice President Noel Petit was the speaker, and he opened with a discussion of satellite operation and involvement. A slide presen tation illustrated the history of satellite involvement in meteor ology and the theory of operation. The slide show was followed by two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) films, one on the formation of outflow boundaries and storm fronts and the second, on satellite meteorology. The meeting was con cluded with a tour of the rooftop equipment for Northern Video graphics. There were two 2 m satellite receiving dishes for GOES East and West, as well as lightning detectors. At the 19 January meeting, Erling Weiberg reported that the Min nesota Historical Society had accepted the past records of the chapter to be kept on file. These records cover the years 1963 1983. The chapter is grateful to Erling for his efforts in preserving the history of the local AMS chapter. Jim Block gave a summary of the events at the AMS Annual Meeting, held 9-13 January in Miami. He mentioned that several discussions were held concerning the issuance of severe weather watches and warnings. The main focus concerned who issues them—the private sector or the National Weather Service. Rev. Thomas Wright, who has done research in the area of weather and its effect on human behavior, was the speaker. He explained that Europe is far ahead of the United States studying the topic. Several studies have been done, particularly in Ger many, that equate known weather conditions to behavioral tend encies. There is, however, a wide range of sensitivity to these effects. There is a way to determine how sensitive you are to weather and the degree in which it will effect your behavorial tendencies. Those more sensitive tend to be very young or old, female,-upper management or blue collar workers. Climatic variation has the effect of introducing outside stress with changes in weather. People living in northern climates, where there are wider climatic changes over the year, tend to be more productive. The continual change in weather provides a more frequent input to stimulate performance. There are several physical properties that have a known effect on behavior. In the passage of a cold front, there are changes in ozone levels, barometric changes, and electromagnetic proper COMPUTERIZED Meteorological Measurement IBM Met One now offers the interface between meteoro logical sensors and a personal computer to provide a complete, automatic weather station.

Seasonal changes in the weather, especially in northern climates, effect the acid/alkaline content in the body. This is known to create the feel ing of "spring fever." Willis "Bud" Skiff, operations manager at Northern States Power Company (NSP), spoke at the 16 February meeting. NSP supplies electrical power to areas in the five-state region of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and part of upper Michigan. There is a cooperative arrangement between NSP and the National Wfeather Service (NWS) in the exchange of potential storm dam age information that can affect the power supply system at NSP. Skiff reviewed the effect on the power supply system produced by four recent storms—summer storms on 3,13, and 19 July 1983, and the heavy wet snow storm of 18-19 November 1981. The 19 July storm created the worst power failure in recent his tory at NSP. It was a mesocyclonic storm that started in North Dakota and traveled down 1-94 through Minnesota to the Twin Cities. The storm hit the Twin Cities at 4:30 pm after creating major problems in Alexandra and St. Cloud, Minn. In 20 min, the storm caused the power distribution in their entire system (six states) to drop 20%. It was so intense, in fact, that at one time or another during its course, the storm affected 50% of NSP's system. The 13 July storm was a tornado in a remote northern area that had a devastating affect in power costs. NSP has a 500 KVA power line that runs from Winnepeg Canada to the NSP system, bringing in low-cost Canadian hydroelectric power. This tornado took out 12 of the power line towers in a very remote area. The cost to repair the line and replace the towers was $ 1.8 million dollars. The storm of 3 July created a situation that compounded the effects of the storm damage. The storm was a line of downburst winds at speeds in excess of 160 kph. These winds started in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities and moved to Western Wisconsin. Damage from the winds was in a smaller area than the later storm of 19 July, however repairs took longer than expected, since it occured on a Sunday of a long weekend, and many of the repair crews were at cabins or out of touch with NSP in the Twin Cities. The November 1981 snow storm was a wet heavy snow—the first significant snowfall for that season. During the worst part of the storm, 165 000 customers were without power. It took three days to restore all the damage and cost $ 1 million dollars to repair. Most damage was caused by branches bending under the weight of the snow and shorting out the lines. Many large branches up to 40 cm in diameter cracked under the weight of the snow, taking out several power lines as they fell. father conditions are particularly important in predicting power generating needs. In the winter, power requirements are directly proportional to temperature and winds. The winter peak is generally around Christmas, due to the use of Christmas lights. During the summer, the peak demand is generally three to four days after a heat wave hits. For the first few days people prefer to "sweat" it out rather than pay higher electric bills. By the third or fourth day, however, they give in to the elements.—Bernard King Smith, Secy. West Central Florida Lt. Dave Neal of the United States Coast Guard Air Station spoke at the 23 February 1984meeting. A brief discussion of equipment and operations was followed by a tour of the facilities. The oper ational area contains a multi-range colorized radar display received via a dedicated line from the Tampa Bay (TBW) National Wîather Service (NWS) office. A pilot briefing and routing area permits communication with the Flight Service Station at the adjacent St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport. Members of the chapter were treated to a first-hand view of the cockpits of the HC-130H and the HH-3F aircraft. Neal explained that the seven-crew member HH-3F helicopter was used in search and rescue operations. Built at a cost of $3.5 million, the HH-3F has a maximum forward speed of 142 kt. The larger and more expensive HC-130H airplane presently has a law enforcement radar but will be retrofitted for weather radar soon. The dedicated people that participate in the rescue operations, often in severe weather, are to be commended.—Andy Johnson, Secy. • Third Joint Conference on Application of Air Pollution Meteorology Sponsored by: American Meteorological Society Air Pollution Contre?] Association Session Topics: ■ Ozone and Long-Range Transport ■ Long-Range Transport and Photochemistry ■ Acid Rain and Visibility ■ Source and Input Data ■ Regulatory Aspects!
