<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophia Reformata 73 (2008) 32-53 ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT: THE CASE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS ANDREW BASDEN Th ose who believe that explicitly Christian thinking is possible in the scientific disci plines tend to assume that it must be antithetical to the world's thinking. Based on some of the author's experience, this article examines a different approach, in which Christian thinking is used to account for and enrich the world's thinking by trans planting it from its current ground-motive (usually that of nature-freedom) into the arguably more fertile soil of the creation-fall-redemption ground-motive. The article shows how Dooyeweerd's version of Christian thinking has been em ployed in two areas of thinking in information systems (selected from five with which the author has been involved): (1) thinking about the nature of computers and information, with the artificial intelligence question of whether computer is like human being (2) soft systems methodology, by which perspectives on 'human activity systems' are orchestrated into new leaming and plans. In both areas, the original ideas are accounted for, given philosophical underpinning, reinterpreted and enriched. These two show that Dooyeweerd's philosophy can be equally useful in thinking grounded in both positivist and interpretivist cultures. 1. Introduction This article is intended for more-or-less Christian readers, especially of a Refor mational persuasion, because it addresses the topic of how Chrisdan thinkers can engage with humanist and other non-Christian thinkers while retaining an explicitly 'Chrisdan' stance. But others too should flnd it understandable, reasonable and interesdng since, underlying that topic, is the more général one of how two apparently incommensurable perspectives can interact with each other. I recently received an email from a Christian thinker who said he found it frustrating to engage with the secular mind. Even though I am deeply critical of secularism, I no longer find it frustrating, but rewarding and stimulating. Though one can argue for a deep antithesis between 'Christian' and secular thought, I see this as secondary to a stronger belief that all of us work and think within the same created cosmos so that even secular thinkers can possess what, from a Christian viewpoint, is genuine insight. Though not trained in philosophy, I have found that the field in which I work, information Systems (IS), has benefited from an understanding and application of the philosophy of Herman Dooyeweerd, and it was for these reasons that I began to explore his thought in the early 1990s. The fact that Dooyeweerd shared my Christian faith was a bonus, and not the primary reason for exploring his ideas. But these fields have also seen the application of other types of philosophy, so I have had to find links between Dooyeweerd's philo sophy and these.</page><page sequence="2">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 133 According to Klapwijk (1986), Reformational philosophy in the wake of Kuyper has long emphasised the antithesis between Christian philosophy (CP) and the world's philosophy (WP). But he argues that this overstates the case and also that in practice CP must have communication with WP. Religious antithesis, with which he agrees, need not necessarily entail philosophical antithesis nor an antithetical approach in science. He suggests a 'transformational philosophy' in which ideas or concepts from WP, such as aliénation, can be 'critically appropriated' by CP. But "the valuable insights of those of other persuasions must be shelled from the pods of their worldviews ... must be pulled up out of the religious ideological soil in which they have thus far been accustomed to flourish." (p.145) Thus a Christian philosophy may be formulated which is not completely isolated from WP but takes account of it. Criticisms of Klapwijk's proposals, such as by Geertsema (1987) do not con cern us here. What is more important is the différence between this proposai and Klapwijk's in how CP engages with WP. Whereas Klapwijk focuses on building a good CP, incorporating input from WP, this article focuses more on building a good WP with input from CP. Or, rather, it focuses on using CP to engage with philosophical ways of understanding a field in which WP has been active. It is through the Dooyeweerdian ability to do justice to both diversity and cohérence that I have subsequently come to understand and value the thought of other thinkers and have a basis for engaging with them. This is a paradox, even in Dooyeweerd's own terms: how can the thought of other thinkers have real value if it is founded on a ground-motive that is antithetical to what he claimed is the Christian one? In my field of information Systems (IS) and information technology (ΓΓ) positivism held sway in the early period (up to the 1980s), interpretivism became a significant paradigm in the 1980s and 1990s, and critical theory, from the 1990s onwards. Though each of these turns is treated as incommensurable with those that preceded it, I have found Dooye weerdian thought to be commensurable with all three and able to both enrich and offer useful critique to all, despite their emerging from the nature-freedom ground-motive (Eriksson 2006). A reflection on why this may be so is found at the end of our discussion. But this article focuses on my actual experience and presents, as worked examples, two issues in which Dooyeweerdian thinking has been found to be enriching. One concerns the nature of computers, which is an issue in which ontology is important, and which has been dominated by a positivist paradigm. The other is information Systems development (ISD), in which epistemology and normativity are important, and which has been dominated in recent years by an interpretivist paradigm. More issues may be found in Basden (2008). The approach taken in each case is not primarily to identify what is wrong with the thinking around the issue, but rather to understand it and then to enrich the insights in it. This is followed by reflective discussion on the types of enrichment that have been demonstrated, on what it is in Dooyeweerdian thought that enables sensitive engagement with and critical enrichment of other thought, and on the influence of different ground-motives.</page><page sequence="3">134 ANDREW BASDEN The discussion here assumes that readers are aware of Dooyeweerd's notion of the spheres of meaning (modal aspects) and of his four religious ground motives (especially the nature-freedom ground-motive (NFGM) and the creation-fall-redemption motive (CFR)), even if only at a cursory level; chapters 2 and 3 of Basden (2008) provide a useful summary of appropriate depth. 2. Levels of computer systems Our first case cornes from a stream of research in IS influenced by the nature pole of NFGM, that of computer science and artiflcial intelligence (AI) as it was constituted in the early 1980s. Allen Newell, a key figure in this field, published in 1982 what was to become his most-cited article, 'The knowledge level'. Newell's main concern was to explore the intuitive distinction between know ledge and the symbols that hold it (in computer systems and — by extension from an AI standpoint — in the human mind). His article had two main parts. In the first, he discussed a number of systems levels, introducing a new level, the knowledge level. Here he focused on the knowledge level, posing the funda mental question "How does an agent's knowledge relate to its symbolic représentation?" In the second he tried to compare computers with humans especially in relation to predictability of behaviour. 2.1 Newell's theory of levels Newell argued that a computer system may be described at several distinct levels: • Device level, whose medium is électrons and magnetic domains in physical materials • Circuit level, whose medium is voltages and currents in electronie components • Logic level, whose medium is bits in computer memory and registers • Symbol level, whose medium is symbols in data structures • Knowledge level, whose medium is knowledge: what the symbols are about: "aboutness". (Note: Some of Newell's terminology cornes from the fields of electronics and computer science: 'device' refers to such things as semiconductor P-N junctions, 'logic' refers not to analysis but to digital electronics in which what is meaningful is not the voltage but whether it is 'on' or 'off, '1' or '0'.) Newell worked out his notion of levels in some detail. Each level provides a set of concepts and vocabulary for describing a System that includes (Newell 1982, 95) "a medium that is to be processed, components that provide primitive processing, laws of composition that permit components to be assembled into Systems, and laws of behavior that détermine how System behavior dépends on the component behavior and the structure of the System". This should enable us to predict the behaviour of a System at each level.</page><page sequence="4">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 135 Different levels describe the same system, not different parts thereof, and do so in equally valid ways — e.g. "The Prospector system found molybdenum deposits" (KL) or "The Prospector system calculated probabilities" (SL). As Newell (1982, 95) said, "Neither of these ... définitions of a level is the more fundamental. It is essential that they both exist and agree." A description at a level is complete, in the sense of not leaving gaps that must be filled in by reference to descriptions from other levels. "It is noteworthy," said Newell (p.95-96), "how radically the levels differ. The medium changes from électrons and magnetic domains ... to current and voltage ... to bits ... to symbolic expressions" ... to knowledge. Each level defines a distinct technology. This distinctness means that, though one can find aggregation within a level (e.g. bit - byte - megabyte) aggregation does not occur between levels (e.g. "bit - byte - symbolic expression" makes no sense). But the levels are not completely independent: for any level to be implemented we must implement the lower levels. For example, knowledge is implemented in (represented by) symbols, symbols are implemented in bit patterns in memory, bits are implemented by voltages at, and currents flowing through, conductors and components, which are implemented in (manufactured from) physical materials. If a system has a description at one level then it will always be possible to describe it at the next lower level, and it will always be possible to realize any level's description as a physical system. But the reverse in not always the case. "Computer systems levels," said Newell (1982, 97), "are not simply levels of abstraction. That a computer has a description at a given level does not necessarily imply it has a description at higher levels." Most of his discussion was devoted to the knowledge level and its relation to the symbol level: "How is knowledge related to représentation?" By knowledge, Newell meant the answer to the question, "What is it that a system has when it has knowledge?" This, he presupposed, should be able to be answered in the same way for both humans and computers. His answer referred to the goals of the system, what the stored symbols signify, reasoning the system makes on these to achieve its goals, and one agent's knowledge of what another knows. 2.2 Dooyeweerdian understanding of levels The reader might already have detected the similarity between Newell's levels and some of Dooyeweerd's aspects: Device level = physical aspect, 'Logic' level (bit, signal) =psychic aspect, Symbol level = analytic and formative aspects Knowledge level = lingual aspect (these approximate équivalences are argued below) and between Newell's theory of levels and Dooyeweerd's théories:</page><page sequence="5">136 ANDREW BASDEN • Each level, as a level of description, provides a number of concepts that are meaningful in a particular way and not in another way, and is thus a sphere of meaning in the Dooyeweerdian sense, that is a modal aspect. • The description at a level, like that from an aspect, is of the whole system, not of a part. What Newell calls system might be Dooyeweerd's enkaptic structural whole. • Both levels and aspects exhibit irreducibility of meaning and law. • The levels and aspects occur in the same sequence. • Both levels and aspects exbibit inter-aspect/level dependency in what Dooyeweerd called the foundational direction. • 'Components' equate to the beings enabled by each aspect. • Levels, like aspects, involve laws of behaviour. • Levels also involve laws of composition, which may resemble Dooye weerd's structures of individuality. • Each level defïnes a distinct technology; each aspect defines a distinct science. Two further similarities may be found. Newell claimed that his levels are not derived from a priori theory but derived primarily from years of practice in AI (1982, 92); Dooyeweerd's aspects are likewise those found in everyday life. Second, Newell made a strong ontological claim for his suite of levels: They [levels] are not just a point of view that exists solely in the eye of the beholder. (p.98) Nature has a say in whether a technology [and therefore a level] can exist. (p.97) To repeat the final remark of the prior section. Computer system levels really exist, as much as anything exists. They are not just a point of view. Thus, to claim that the knowledge level exists is to make a scientific claim, which can range from dead wrong to slightly askew, in the manner of all scientific claims. (p.99) Likewise, though Dooyeweerd held that his suite of aspects should be subject to criticism and refinement (Dooyeweerd 1955, II, 556), they also imply some kind of ontological claim as being 'not just a point of view'. 2.3 On assigning levels to aspects The level-aspect correspondences suggested above need examination and justification. The device level, concerned with physical materials, is obviously the physical aspect of the computer. The knowledge level's concern with 'aboutness' closely matches the lingual aspect's 'signification'. (Also, Newell saw the rôle of symbols as giving 'distal access'; this might echo Dooyeweerd's view that meaning 'refers beyond'.) But the other level-aspect correspondences, though perhaps intuitively appealing, require clarification of how to assign levels to aspects, which is a process that is neither exact nor provable. The reader might use this as a worked exemplar for aligning other suites of levels with Dooyeweerd's aspects. Why do I align the bit level with the psychic aspect? First, by considering what concepts are meaningful at this level, we can immediately rule out most aspects.</page><page sequence="6">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 137 Bits (on-off states) have no meaning in the physical aspect, nor in the formative nor lingual aspects. But they could be meaningful in the analytic aspect, of sharp distinctions, or the psychic aspect, in which pre-cognitive mental states are meaningful. We do not hereby attribute either mental states or distinction-making to the computer as subject, but only as object (Dooyeweerd's version of subject object, not Descartes'); this is discussed below. So, second, we can consider human experience of the computer as object, via its user interface (UI), in these aspects in more detail. In the analytic aspect, we experience distinct, individual pièces of data (a number, a word, etc.) on screen, but in the psychic aspect we experience colours, shapes, etc. The bit level of a screen is the pixels, which possess the property of colour, rather than pièces of data. Therefore the bit level seems more aligned with the psychic aspect than the analytic. Third, we may compare things at each level of a computer System with aspects of a human subject. Analytic opération of human memory involves conceptualization. But there is also a psychic opération of memory (including what Dooyeweerd called animal distinctions that enable récognition of e.g. mates (1955, I, 39)), which involves neurone activation states, and signais sent between them. It is the latter that is replicated in computers in terms of bit patterns and signais. fourni, on closer exammation, digitization appears not to be essential to the bit level. Neither the multi-valued colours of pixels nor the opération of analog computers are simple on-off states. For at least these four reasons we are justified in aligning the bit level of the computer with the psychic aspect. Regarding the symbol level, it must first be noted that Dooyeweerd's use of the word 'symbolic', referring to the lingual aspect, must not be confused with 'symbol' in computer science, which refers to pieces of data. It is more like a concept. Though a 'symbol' might anticipate lingual signification, might stand for something, some do not, for example temporary variables. Later, Newell (1993) encountered a dichotomy within his symbol level that he could not explain, which centred on whether the 'symbols' are processed or not. Such processing involves formative power. So I have no hésitation in aligning the symbol level, as pieces of data and as processing and structure, with the analytic and formative aspects respectively. Finally, we missed out the circuit level (hardware) and the organic aspect, yet they occupy the equivalent position in each suite. Might they correspond with each other? If we can only see the organic aspect as life functions, then a quick answer must be "No" on the grounds that the computer neither lives nor directly supports life. But we might note Dooyeweerd's own difficulty in identi fying the organic aspect of Praxiteles' sculpture (1955, III, 112ff). After a leng thy discussion he concluded that its organic aspect lay in what, of the sculpture, the human organic functioning (tissues, organs, etc.) engages with. Of the computer, the human tissues and organs engage with things like mouse and screen: the manufactured hardware components. Since it is such things that are meaningful at Newell's circuit level, this level may reasonably be aligned with the organic aspect. Added evidence for this might be found in the fact</page><page sequence="7">138 ANDREW BASDEN that one of the key organic functions is the maintenance of an equilibrium and integrity of the organism that is not explainable in terms of the physical environment. The hardware of the computer forms a distinct 'physical' entity, with an equilibrium that cannot be explained in terms of the environment, and which is designed to maintain its own integrity (e.g. by feedback and hardware memory checksums). These level-aspect correspondences are summarised in Table 1, and discussed in more detail in Basden (2008). Table 1. Newell's levels and Dooyeweerd's aspects Level Aspect Device Physical Circuit (hardware) Organic Bit (logic) Psychic Symbol (data types) Analytic Symbol (process, structure) Formative Knowledge Lingual Though we have, to some extent, tried to 'fill slots' of levels or aspects, two things may be noted. First, most of the alignments have been quite natural. Second with the exception of the splitting of the symbol level, we have no gaps in either seqnence, which is interesting given both thinkers' ontic beliefs that there are no more aspects/levels 'nestling in between' the ones of the either suite. A similar exercise may be carried out when critically examining the align ment of Dooyeweerd's aspects with any other suite of 'levels' (such as those by Boulding, Bunge, Hartmann, Maslow). 2.4 Underpinning and enriching Newell's theory of levels Towards the end of his article Newell sought a philosophical underpinning for his theory, suggesting that the différence between the knowledge and symbol levels was similar to that between what Dennett (1978) called the intentional and subpersonal stances, which in turn were based on Brentano's (1874) con cept of intentionality. But there are significant différences from Dennett, and Newell called for closer analysis (1982, 123). Can Dooyeweerd, who criticised 'intentionality' (e.g. 1955, II, 28ff.), provide a sounder philosophical underpin ning than Dennett? While Dennett might account for the différence between the symbol and knowledge levels, he cannot account for all the levels, nor for the host of characteristics of levels, and certainly would disagree with Newell's ontic claim. By contrast, Dooyeweerd accounts for all of these quite nicely, as shown above.</page><page sequence="8">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 139 If Dooyeweerd can underpin Newell's notion of levels, then it should be possible to reinterpret it from the standpoint of Dooyeweerd's philosophy and yet remain sensitive to what Newell was aiming for. To most Systems theorists, levels are just distinct catégories. Some, such as Bunge and Hartmann, recognise foundational dependency. Newell went fur ther, in recognising laws of behaviour and composition, different types of medium, and the rôle of levels as providing a complete description of a thing. But Dooyeweerd was a philosopher, while Newell was not. So it is no surprise to fmd that Dooyeweerd has worked out the notion of aspects more soundly than Newell did. This means that Dooyeweerd might be able to enrich and, where necessary, correct Newell. For example: There are five levels but fifteen aspects; could this point to other levels? It is no surprise to find Carley and Newell (1994) and Jennings (2000) discussing a social level. Dependency is often confused with reducibility (even sometimes in Newell), but Dooyeweerd provides a basis for clearly separating them by focusing on meaning. In addition to the foundational direction of dependency, Dooyeweerd would offer an anticipatory direction. For example, data storage (analy tic) anticipâtes its being processed (formative), which in turn anticipâtes standing for something (lingual). Exploration of anticipations can enrich Newell's theory. Dooyeweerd's aspects involve inherent normativity; so this could provide Newell's levels with the ability to give normative guidance to those work ing at each level. If what Newell calls System is Dooyeweerd's enkaptic structural whole, then we can bring Dooyeweerd's whole theory of enkaptic relationships to bear. For example, the relationship between program and operating system might be understood as corrélative enkapsis. Our understanding of laws of composition of levels might benefit by being informed by Dooyeweerd's theory of structures of individuality. Newell focuses only on the bits, symbols and knowledge 'inside' the com puter. But remove the cover and we cannot see them. What philosophical basis do we have for treating them as 'inside' the computer? Dooyeweerd provides one, in his discussion of how technical apparatus can deepen naïve experience (1955, III, 102), and we can integrate this with our experience at the UI. That each aspect defines a distinct science, with distinct methods, criteria, etc., could inform our development of the technologies associated with each level. Finally, while Newell focused on the AI question and ignored such issues as the benefits or detrimental impact of computer use, information Sys tems development and the information society, Dooyeweerd provides the basis for integrating our understanding of those issues with that of the nature of computers. Basden (2008) discusses these in more depth, inclu ding how this understanding can assist the design of system architectures.</page><page sequence="9">140 ANDREW BASDEN Given ail the above, it seems Dooyeweerd can not only underpin NeweU's notion of levels philosophically but enrich many of the elements. 2.5 Comparing computer and human But we must be careful, because the two thinkers présupposé different ground motives — as becomes apparent when we try to compare computer with hitman. Newell focused on the unpredictability of human behaviour and the predictability (in principle) of computer behaviour. On the reasonable assump tion that descriptions at symbol and knowledge level are valid for both computers and humans, he is faced with the conundrum that knowledge level behaviour is unpredictable but symbol level behaviour is predictable. How does non-determinate behaviour emerge from determinate? Newell's honest attempt at an answer is complex. Briefly, since knowledge involves reasoning with what is represented as symbols within the agent, Newell defined knowledge as the logical closure of (i.e. the total of what could ever be deduced from) all that is represented in the agent's mind (for example, if I know X is father of Y and brother of Ζ then I know that Y is nephew/niece of Z). This knowledge could be infinité in extent. But an observer agent can never know what portion of another agent's such knowledge is actually used in any spécifie décision, so the former cannot predict the latter's behaviour precisely, without help from the symbol level. So the knowledge level is 'radically incomplete' as a level of description. There are several problems with INewell's approach. Une is that ne does not address genuine non-determinacy; he hides that issue behind inability to predict. Though he does not say so explicitly, it seems that he still believed the cosmos including human beings to be deterministic. And why should the knowledge level be unlike other levels in being 'incomplete'? But the main problem is that his définition of knowledge as logical closure is completely at variance with everyday experience and even normal theoretical définitions. These difficulties may be because of two presuppositions, which become more visible when contrasted with a Dooyeweerdian stance. One is the AI presupposition, that computers and human beings are equivalent and that this équivalence is unproblematically discussed on the basis of substance-concepts (knowledge and symbols). It led him to overlook an obvious factor. Knowledge level behaviour is believed to be non-determinate because of our experience of human behaviour. Only on the AI presupposition, that knowledge-substance is the same for human and computer, can it be assumed that computer know ledge level behaviour will likewise be non-determinate. Similarly, symbol level behaviour is believed to be determinate because of our experience with com puters, to whose symbol level we have access since we programmed them. But we have no direct access to the symbol level of our own minds and, only on the AI presupposition, that symbol-substance is the same for human and computer, do we assume that human symbol level behaviour is determinate too. The other is the systems theorist presupposition, that behaviour at one level 'emerges' from the level below (example: life 'emerged' from physical processes). This is what makes it mandatory to explain how knowledge level</page><page sequence="10">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 141 behaviour emerges from symbol level behaviour. If we do not hold that presupposition, that question need not be posed, and a different relationship between determinacy and non-determinacy may be considered. Searle (1980) tried to overcome Newell's problem, on the same presupposi tional base, by simply holding a dogma that computers and humans are fundamentally different substance (or 'causality'): while physical causality can 'manipulate formai symbols' biological causality is needed to 'process informa tion'. But Searle offers no reason why this should be so. Searle's opponents remain unconvinced, simply holding the opposing dogma. As a resuit, the AI question remains unresolved even after 30 years. This is not surprising from a Dooyeweerdian perspective. The AI and systems theoretic presuppositions are variants of what Dooyeweerd called the imma nence presupposition as it appears in the nature-freedom ground-motive. Dooyeweerd claimed the immanence presupposition always leads to irresol vable problems. Dooyeweerd's presupposition of the creation-fall-redemption ground-motive would both pose and answer the question, of how to compare human and computer, differently. While Searle dogmatically asserts that computers and humans are unalike, and Newell assumed they are alike, Dooyeweerd allows two types of alikeness: what we might call subject-likeness and meaning-likeness. Dooyeweerd would allow that it is as meaningful to say "The Prospector program found a molybdenum deposit" as to say "Using Prospector, Jim found a molybdenum deposit." In terms of meaning, computer and human are alike, because both function within the same meaning-framework. But they function in different ways, one (program) as object, one (Jim) as subject. We can validly say, without anthropomorphism or metaphor, that the Prospector knows and can reason about mineral deposits, as long as we recognise that, in the aspects of knowing, it is functioning as object as part of human subject-functioning in the post-physical aspects. The very being and functioning of the computer in these aspects is by virtue of our attributing meaning of those aspects to the physical subject-functioning of the computer; for example the very idea of 'bit' is an attribution of meaning to physical electric charge. But the computer can function as subject only in the physical and pre physical aspects. It is only in these aspects that the computer 'as such' is like the human. Allowing for two types of alikeness helps overcome Newell's problem. The deterministic behaviour of the computer is accounted for, not as Searle does from such things as 'symbol manipulations', but solely by reference to its physical subject-functioning. In post-physical aspects, as long as we attribute meaning to this in a systematic way, the computer's behaviour also appears to be deterministic. But human functioning in later aspects is non-deterministic, so we can be less than systematic in our attribution, as for example when we make faulty attribution. Then the computer seems wayward in its behaviour. Basden (2008) provides fuller discussion, including of inconsistency in Searle's position. Dooyeweerd's view of the relationship between aspects is not one that admits of an automatic emergence process. So the question of how non-determinacy</page><page sequence="11">142 ANDREW BASDEN emerges from determinacy no longer applies. That early aspects are determinate while later aspects are not, leads us to expect determinacy at one level and non-determinacy at another. So if we pose the question as "In what ways is it meaningful to say that computers can behave like humans?" then Dooyeweerd can provide an answer that avoids both the confusion of Newell and the unnecessary dogma of Searle. 2.6 Conclusion Thus not only can Dooyeweerd underpin and enrich Newell's notion of levels, but he can résolve some of the problems at the very root of the discussion of the comparison between computers and humans, putting them on a new foun dation. Newell worked within a tradition that views human beings through the lens of naturalistic science. But the field of information Systems began the move away from that tradition in the early 1980s. We now discuss part of this movement. 3. SSM and CA TWOE Newell assumed a deterministic cosmos in which freedom is only apparent. What became known as 'soft systems methodology' (SSM) assumes the oppo site: complete freedom of human beings to interpret, appreciate and décidé, and thereby affect the course of events. SSM was fïrst devised by Peter Checkland (1981) as a reaction against System analysis and development methods that had been influenced by the assumption of a more-or-less rational world: organisations were assumed to run according to clearly-defined rules, at least in the idéal. But the reality of organisational life is that the rules by which they run need interprétation, that interprétation présupposé perspectives, that even the implementation of rules can be variable, and that all this is not a departure from the idéal. The apparent diversity of these makes both prédiction and control very difficult, so real organisations were ill-served by traditional methods. Checkland experienced this tension in the UK chemical industry, and devised SSM. SSM was conceived fïrst as a method of intervention in human situations ('human activity systems') that enabled some degree of systematic analysis and action in spite of diversity. Later it developed into a method that enables organisations to learn. SSM has several phases: finding out about the system or situation, modelling it, deciding action, taking action. In the modelling phase the participants abstract from the situation so that new ideas might be generated. 3.1 SSM concepts Central to SSM is developing a 'rich picture' of the situation, which is expressed in a single 'root définition'. Expérience has shown (Smyth and Checkland 1976)</page><page sequence="12">ENGAG1NG WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 143 that this contains at least the following six elements, 'CATWOE', as defined in Checkland's classic Systems Theory; Systems Practice (1981 ): • C - customers: "beneficiaries or victims affected by the system's activities" • A - actors: "agents who carry out, or cause to be carried out, the main activities of the System, especially its main transformation" • Τ - transformation process: "the means by which deftned inputs are transformed into defined outpuf' (where input is current situation and output is desired situation) • W - Weltanschauung: "an outlook, framework or image that makes this particular root définition meaningful" • O - ownership of the System: "some agency having a prime concern for the system and the ultimate power to cause the System to cease to exist" • Ε - environmental constraints: "features of the system's environments and/orwider Systems which it has to take as 'given'." For example (Checkland and Scholes 1990, 37) a house-painüng System is "A householder-owned [O.C] and manned [A] System to paint a garden fence [T], by conventional hand painting, in keeping with the overall décoration scheme of the property [E], in order to enhance the visnal appearance of the property [W]." SSM has been widely used in business since the 1970s. Usually CATWOE analysis is carried out in a group and several Ws, Os, Cs and Ts are tried, leading to several alternative root définitions from which alternative courses of action might be chosen. CATWOE has remained essentially the same ail this time, suggesting it 'works'. But it does not work as well as it might, suggesting it could be improved (Bergvall-Kâreborn, Mirijamdotter and Basden 2004). Learning to use CATWOE is hindered by ambiguous définition of its elements and no clear understanding of why each element is needed. Spécifie problems are outlined below, along with the Dooyeweerdian enrichment that can ameliorate them. 3.2 A Dooyeweerdian understanding of CATWOE Various authors have suggested ad-hoc improvements to SSM. But more prin cipled improvements may be made by reference to Dooyeweerd's philosophy. For example, Mirijamdotter and Bergvall-Kâreborn (2006) have applied Dooyeweerdian thought to SSM as a whole. Basden and Wood-Harper (2006) applied Dooyeweerdian thought to CATWOE. The latter will be outlined here. Basden and Wood-Harper sought to examine each element from a Dooye weerdian perspective, to disclose its meaning in real-life use of SSM. The meaning of most elements is seen to be multi-aspectual, but in different ways: Τ (Transformation): A common pröblem is that Τ is conceived too nar rowly. But if we see Τ as multi-aspectual human functioning (including the social aspects), then this stimulâtes those who participate in CATWOE analysis to actively consider a wider variety of T.</page><page sequence="13">144 ANDREW BASDEN C (Customer): A common problem here is that many potential or actual beneficiaries, and especially victims, of Τ are overlooked, particularly those without a voice. The word 'customer' has unhelpful connotations. Using Dooyeweerd, the attention shifts from the people or interest groups as such to the aspectual repercussions of T, which can occur in all aspects. That the aspects transcend all involved as well as the whole situa tion in which Τ occurs, and are diverse, stimulâtes wide-ranging discussion and draws attention to repercussions that are often overlooked. A (Actor): Few problems have been reported here. However, if Τ is multi aspectual then it is likely that the competencies required in those who carry out Τ will be diverse. Dooyeweerd's aspects can be used to plan the provision of such competencies. W (Weltanschauung): The main problems here are that non-dominant perspectives (Ws) are suppressed, that there is no sound basis for judging between Ws (it has been said that SSM could have been employed in designing a more efficient concentration camp), and that SSM cannot cope with conflict (clashing Ws). The latter two problems arise from the subjectivist thread in SSM, which allows us merely to describe Ws, never to judge them. The connection between Dooyeweerd and SSM hinges on W being what makes Τ meaningful while aspects are spheres of meaning. So a particular W is likely to be centred on an aspect. This gives a basis for judging Ws, in that any absolutization or distortion of an aspect is anti normative and thus detrimental. Absolutization of different aspects causes conflicts. Having the suite of aspects available as an analytical tooi, as with Τ and C above, means that non-dominant Ws need not be suppressed. O (Owner): This concept has been found difficult to use in practice, partly because it is assumed to be a single person, partly because it is ambiguous, and partly because it is not clear whether O is part of the system or the environment. Dooyeweerd's focus on law implies respon sibility. Reinterpreting O as multi-aspectual responsibility, rather than as a person, makes the concept more usable in practice and the other problems dissolve. Ε (Environmental constraints): A major problem here is that Ε often merely restâtes the status quo, which hinders considération of imaginative possibilities and results in many CATWOE analyses generating insipid proposals. A problem also arises when constraints are not part of the environment but are inherent in the system itself. Reinterpreting Ε in the light of aspectual law résolves the latter issue automatically and can ameliorate the former problem. This is because aspectual law knows no boundary between system and environment, and it transcends both status quo and all possible alternatives. Aspectual law enables as well as con strains. This, together with the diversity of aspects, can stimulate imagina tive ideas that nevertheless remain meaningful in the real world. This enriches each element, sometimes reinterpreting it slightly — but never in a way that is at variance with how it is used and understood in SSM application.</page><page sequence="14">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 145 This also enables us to provide a philosophical underpinning for each element of CATWOE. As a resuit, this makes the six elements less ambiguous and easier to learn to use in practice. In addition, Basden and Wood-Harper (2006, 82) suggested that Dooye weerd can explain why each element is important (meaningful) in the human activity system: "W is central because Meaning is primary. Τ, Ε and C are intégral parts of human func honing seen as response to normative aspectual law-promises that have repercussions. O and A are qualified by two of the most important aspects of a transformation, the juridical aspect of responsibility and the formative aspect of cultural shaping and achieving." This underpins Smyth and Checkland's (1976) finding that each element seemed necessary. This raises the question of whether CATWOE as such is adequate from a Dooyeweerdian perspective. For example, if the nine human aspects are normative for any human activity — including making transformations to human activity Systems — then perhaps there should be nine elements, not six. This possibility has not been discussed, but it opens new avenues for SSM research. 3.3 Commensurability between SSM and Dooyeweerd Checkland did actually try to ground SSM in philosophy, making reference to no less than 40 philosophers in his Systems Theory; Systems Practuê. Why should we add a 41st? More fundamentally, Checkland stressed two main philosophical underpinnings that are, arguably, incommensurable with Dooyeweerd: systems theory and interpretivism / subjectivism. This makes the proposai to underpin SSM with Dooyeweerd very bold because it implies displacing Checkland's two underpinnings. On what basis may we even consider doing this? A practical basis for doing so was summarised in the previous section. A theoretical basis is that Checkland's philosophical profligacy leads to a number of inconsistencies; Probert (1997) suggests that Checkland's appeal to early modern natural science philosophers and to Popper clashes with his subjectivism. But we also need a philosophical basis for doing so. Is there really an inner connection between Dooyeweerd and SSM that the enrichment of CATWOE might suggest? First, though SSM bears the label 'systems', the main tenets of systems theory — the supremacy of the part-whole (subsystem-system) relationship, emergence, autopoiesis, and the notion of boundary between system and environment — play only minor parts, if any, in actual SSM. Notions found in Dooyeweerd's thought seem to play a larger part. For example, the attempt to define a root définition is not so much the attempt to delineate a boundary between system and environment, as the expression of a distinct central idea — and Dooyeweerd can account for this in terms of functioning in the analytic and lingual aspects. For example, the concept of which Checkland (1981, 18) says "This concept is the most important one in the methodology" is not that of system, but that of Weltanschauung, important precisely because it makes Τ</page><page sequence="15">146 ANDREW BASDEN 'meaningful'. So meaning is more central to SSM than system — and meaning is central in Dooyeweerd too. Second, though SSM is generally thought to be based on interpretivism, if we examine what facets of interpretivism are important in SSM, we find they are those which Dooyeweerd would affirm. The central idea is not only that people are expected to hold different perspectives, but also that they are free to do so, not constrained by organisational rules or historical precedents that would preclude certain courses of action a priori; such constraints had characterized pre-SSM thinking. So Checkland stressed this freedom and built it into his method. Dooyeweerd would see this, not as interpretivism as such, but as a very valid attempt to escape the absolutization of the aspects at work in rationalistic functionalism, by opening participants' to acknowledge ail normative aspects. Eriksson (2006) draws attention to an even deeper possible incommen surability. He employed Dooyeweerd's insight into the nature-freedom ground motive (NFGM) to obtain strategie understanding of the relationship between different types of Systems thinking: • Hard Systems thinking, a name for that against which Checkland was reacting, is aligned with the Nature pôle. • Soft Systems thinking, the stance which underlies SSM, is aligned with the Freedom pôle. • Critical Systems thinking, a stance based on the Frankfurt School, attempts to bridge both pôles, but unsuccessfully. h ven ιί Sb M is closer to Dooyeweerd than to Systems theory and mterpretivism, if Eriksson is right, then how can SSM be commensurable with Dooyeweerd, whose thought is rooted in the creation-fall-redemption ground-motive (CFR)? Our answer to this is that the ground-motives seem more important in theoretical thought than in everyday living, where both control and freedom work together. It is only when we take a theoretical attitude governed by NFGM that we suppose they are incompatible. Since both SSM and Dooyeweerdian philosophy are oriented towards 'real-world situations', the différence in ground-motive may not be as troublesome as we fear. What we may learn from this is that the actual proposals made by humanist thinkers are often commensurable with Dooyeweerd, when taken as used in real life, even if theoretical attempts to ground those proposals are not. 4. Réfections We may now reflect on the above. In both cases it will be seen that we eschewed the common form of argument that examines extant views, uncovers problems and then proposes a solution. This is because the very récognition of a problem already présupposés a viewpoint from which it is meaningful as a problem. Since we are proposing a different viewpoint, that strategy is inappropriate. In stead, we tried first to understand the important issues from within (immanent critique), then to reconceptualise them within a Dooyeweerdian framework,</page><page sequence="16">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 147 and then problems became visible. I find this approach a very fruitful way to engage with and enrich humanist and other thought because it begins by affïrming rather than questioning their main insights, and have used it for formulating new frameworks for understanding a number of issues in IS in addition to the two outlined here. 4.1 The value of Dooyeweerd That Dooyeweerd was able to underpin and enrich both Newell's and Checkland's ideas suggests that Dooyeweerd provides what they seemed to be reaching for, even perhaps without their knowing it. In his notion of levels, Newell seems to have been reaching for something that current thought could not provide: a suite of ways of describing compu ters which was "a fact of nature" and not merely a point of view. Moreover, he wanted each way of describing to incorporate laws of composition and behaviour, and the whole suite to reflect the everyday lifeworld of AI research and practice. Dooyeweerd offers all these. In his comparison of computer with human, Newell wanted a way of bringing them together, but his entrapment in the NFGM made it difficult to reconcile the non-predictability of human behaviour with the deterministic calculations that computers make at the symbol level. Dooyeweerd addresses this problem. In his SSM, Checkland seems to have been reaching for a way to do justice to the diversity of meaning in 'human activity systems' and our experience of freedom to interpret them in creative ways, while acknowledging responsibility and constraints. Dooyeweerd offers this. These mixtures of needs pose problems for conventional thought, but Dooyeweerd can speak to them quite eloquently. Why might this be? One reason is that Dooyeweerd attempted not primarily to build a philosophical theory but rather to clear away impediments that prevent us seeing the struc ture of reality (of which the NFGM is one). Since it is this reality which urges itself on us all — including Newell and Checkland — when we take everyday life seriously we find that the Dooyeweerdian reinterpretion of their thought enables us to see more clearly the structure of the part of reality they were struggling with. Another reason is that Dooyeweerd examined critically what both Newell and Checkland seemed to take for granted: diversity and meaning — and took them as his starting-point. In such ways, and for these reasons, Dooyeweerdian thought can underpin and accept, reinterpret and enrich the world's thinking. 4.2 The versatility of Dooyeweerd Dooyeweerdian thought nas been used in a variety of ways in both cases. What Dooyeweerd enriched was, in the flrst, a conceptual framework for under standing, and in the second, a methodology. In the first case we used Dooye weerd to supply an alternative, sounder philosophical underpinning for existing</page><page sequence="17">148 ANDREW BASDEN ideas, which could take them further, in the second, we reinterpreted the central concepts. In both cases, we were able to respect the original motivation behind the proposed ideas and the main meaning of ail concepts. In both cases we suggested a new philosophical or presuppositional foundation. In both cases we found it resulted in enrichment. In the first case, we used Dooyeweerd to make presuppositions more visible. In the second case, it was found that Dooyeweerd, by offering a fuller understanding of the central concepts, makes them easier to learn and apply. Dooyeweerd's thought has enriched and underpinned both an area where technology is the focus and an area in which the human is the focus — areas centred on each pole of the NFGM. Why is this possible? It is possible because Dooyeweerd embraces the human and that which is other than human, with that which transcends both. Both the human and the technological may be understood within the same framework of meaning-and-law without denaturing either of them, yet always urging us to remember the other. Thus, in pondering the nature of computers this framework urges us to remember that this issue cannot even be posed as a question, let alone answered, without taking human aspects into account. Likewise, in pondering human activity Systems, this frame work provides a way to affirm human freedom without sacrificing the notion of a reality that transcends us. As discussed below, this is made possible in a self coherent way (Clouser 2005) because Dooyeweerd worked outside the NFGM. These two examples show how versatile Dooyeweerd's framework can be — and other examples can be found in Basden (2008). 4.3 Pitfalls What might be the pitfalls in this approach? Since such application of Dooye weerd's philosophy is relatively new, it is too early to give any definite answer to that, but we might note the following problems. One danger is self-sufficiency. If Dooyeweerdian thought is indeed able to provide an integrating foundation for other thought, then it would seem more complete than that other thought. It is therefore tempting to ignore what Klapwijk (1986) calls the world's philosophy (WP), but doing so leads to isola tion and perhaps arrogance. But Klapwijk's approach does not completely overcome the danger of self sufficiency, because the rôle he proposed for WP is mainly of helping build a more complete CP (Christian philosophy). This can lead us to engage only when we already know there are gaps to fill or issues to address, in a rather functionalist manner in which the other thought is 'used' rather than respec ted or enriched. This is unsatisfactory. Sometimes the very first glimpse of the fruitful way forward does not emerge from reflecting on Reformational thought as such, but is offered by the humanist thought itself. Had I not read Newell, it might never have occurred to me to apply Dooyeweerd to formulate a multi-aspectual way of understanding the nature of computers. Dooyeweerd's treatment (1955, III) of things like the worn book, the microscope, Praxiteles' sculpture and performance art, was unlikely on its own to lead me to it but,</page><page sequence="18">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 149 having read Newell, the relevance of miilti-aspectual being became obvious (see Basden 2007, chapter 5). Another danger that I find myself prone to is that my motivation is often to explore how Dooyeweerd can be used to address issues rather than to address the issues as such. Part of the joy I found in enriching CATWOE was not that CATWOE beneflted but that Dooyeweerd was so suited to this task. While such personal joy is valid, it should not be the only motivator of academie discourse. There is also a converse danger: being embarrassed about Dooyeweerd. Perhaps previous générations of Reformational thinkers were too enthusiastic about Dooyeweerd, and even seemed arrogant, so that a reaction set in (espe cially, I observe, in the Netherlands). But, as seen above, Dooyeweerd has some thing significant to offer. These dangers can be ameliorated by respecting humanist and other thought as something of value in its own right, even from a Christian perspec tive, and attempting to enrich it in ways that it itself would welcome. 4.4 The Challenge But taking this approach is hard work. One must properly understand Dooyeweerd, properly understand the other thought, and convey an under standing of Dooyeweerd to others which they can embrace. One must under stand it in its own terms (that is, immanently) rather than from a 'Reforma tional' starting-point — its underlying aims, motivations, hopes, and what previous problems it is trying to overcome. Then there must be a period of reflection and discourse in which the two ways of thinking are linked sensitively to each other, without any attempt to force. This process is not just an analyti cal one but has a certain aesthetic and justice in it, together with an ethical aspect of self-giving. For example, I did not rush to align Newell's levels with Dooyeweerd's aspects but let them coexist in my reflection for a decade before they came together naturally. Is it worth the hard work? History shows another danger: compromise of inappropriate kind. Mediaeval thought, in trying to synthesize the Greek and Biblical ground-motives, instead of 'Christianizing' pagan thought was itself 'paganized' into a dialectical ground-motive. A smaller, more recent example may perhaps be found in De Raadt's (1997) attempt to combine Dooye weerdian aspects with the Viable Systems Model of Stafford Beer, to produce Multi-Modal Systems Thinking. The resuit was a little uncomfortable, because De Raadt accepted Beer's focus on processes and boundaries, and Strijbos (2006) suggests that it is still partly based on the nature-freedom motive. Is it not inévitable, if Christians try to engage with other thought, for their own thought to end up compromised? I do not believe so. If we simply bring a scheme together with Dooyeweerd, accepting its key concepts as they are without question, then it may be that compromise is inévitable. But what I have tried to do in information Systems is to critically reinterpret the key concepts — the elements of CATWOE and the levels of Newell — in a way that fulfils their deepest aspirations. We may see this</page><page sequence="19">150 ANDREW BASDEN as transplanting the other thonght into the creation-fall-redemption ground motive. 4.5 Transplanting to different gronnd-motive Klapwijk uses two metaphors, which it might be useful to modify. The first metaphor was already used by some of the Church Fathers: 'spoiling the Egyptians', taking their riches (which, Klapwijk points out, was due to the Israélites for all their work over the previous 400 years). I, however, prefer to think in terms of a partial fulfilment of the Abrahamic Covenant by which all nations will be blessed because of God's people and of Romans 8:18-22 in which the entire création rejoices when the 'sons of God' are revealed. The second metaphor we saw at the start, where Klapwijk talks of 'pulling up'. Our approach, however, is more like transplanting, front the barren soil of the NFGM to the more fertile soil of CFR, where what is transplanted can flourish. When we move plants into more fertile soil they retain their nature but flourish and become more beautiful and fruitful. It may be the same with humanist ideas transplanted from the barren soil of NFGM into the more fertile soil of CFR. (The seemingly arrogant claim of fertility rests on the assumption that God created and redeems.) What is this transplanting of ideas? in my expenence, ït is possible to give critical respect to tne ideas encoun tered in our disciplines' paradigms, even while recognising their spécifie limitations (such as aspects ignored). This involves paying less attention to the words in which ideas are couched, or the précisé formulation of the positive proposals humanist thinkers make, and more to their underlying concerns and the général thrust of their proposals. When we do this, the ideas are no longer mere concepts or théories but become 'alive' with aspiration and meaning. As such they become candidates for reinterpretation within the scope of Dooye weerd's spheres of meaning and law (aspects). This frequently reveals their inherent diversity and usually one ('qualifying') aspect characterizes what they aspired to be as ideas and théories. In this way they can be transplanted without distorting or damaging their original aspiration, and they flourish in the new soil of CFR. Why should this be possible, if — as many Reformational thinkers maintain — there is a deep antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thinking? There seems to be two reasons. One has already been alluded to: while thinkers might appeal to one pôle of a dualistic ground-motive to form their théories, much of their naïve thought and living embraces both pôles. As Chesterton (1908, 35) once aptly pointed out, "The ordinary man ... has always believed that there was such a thing as fate, but such a thing as free will also." The other is that création and rédemption of God is deeper and more fundamental than any supposed antithesis, so thinking based on other ground-motives will still contain genuine insight. (It may be noted that Dooyeweerd also expressed appréciation of and even admiration for thinkers of other traditions, despite their being trapped in dualistic ground-motives.) Klapwijk's (1986) version of transformational philosophy was concerned with building a better Christian philosophy (CP) by 'critical appropriation' of ideas from the world's philosophy (WP), involving:</page><page sequence="20">ENGAGING WITH AND ENRICHING HUMANIST THOUGHT 151 a) taking of the ideas and concepts from WP b) reinterpreting them in the light of the CFR ground-motive. But in our cases we also have a third activity: c) re-activating them in their original working context. Klapwijk does in fact acknowledge this third step in a short concluding section in which he argues that CP "must direct itself to real people, as they express their experiences in the language and thought patterns of particular cultures" (p.150). But he did not develop it very far. This article tries to take it further by focusing on the third stage. The transplanting of ideas into the soil of CFR is not to be seen in terms of 'critical appropriation' of them into CP but in terms of offering the deeper insights of CP to WP and, more widely, to the world's thinking (WT) in the disciplines. There must also be a feedback from WT into CP. But the aim is not so much to build a perfected, complete CP as to shed light abroad into WP and WT in a way that attracts their practitioners, so that "Nations will be drawn to your light" (Psalm 60:3). 5. Concluding discussion I have sought, in this article, to reflect on my experiences of using Dooye weerdian thought in my interdisciplinary field of information Systems, which has led me to enrich rather than oppose humanist thought. To summarise, the approach has been applied to a technical idea developed under a positivist framework and a methodological idea developed within an interpretivist framework. Three others are discussed in Basden (2008). In Basden (1999) I also applied it to a philosophical idea that is sometimes seen as anti-Christian (viz. Hegei's notion of Spirit) but perhaps need not be. We may detect some common threads: • Seeing the thought as insight rather than error, we seek to get behind the words used to an immanent understanding of its concepts and what its inner motivation is. • We seek to reconceptualize the insight in Dooyeweerdian terms, and affirm its concepts. • This usually results in enriching the concepts ... • ... and often in addressing problems that the thought is acknowledged to exhibit. • In addition, we have found it possible to set the insight on a sound philosophical foundation, for example by accounting for what had been held as a dogma or merely gleaned from experience. By this means the enriched insights retain much of their original thrust and intention. Some dangers in this approach have been discussed.</page><page sequence="21">152 ANDREW BASDEN It is, of course, not uncommon for new théories to expand previous ones, but this usually happens within the bounds of a particular scientific paradigm or within a particular philosophical stance. It is rare for thought from one stance to enrich that in another; positivism and interpretivism seldom actually enrich each other, for example. But I have found that Dooyeweerd enables me to enrich thought across a variety of philosophical stances. (One stance I have yet to work in is postmodernism, but if Smith (1999) is correct, then that is where Dooyeweerd can really shine.) Whereas there has been some attempt to apply Dooyeweerd to the sciences of the early aspects — mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology — this article suggests his thought can be applied also to at least some of the later sciences of the human aspects (specifically computer and management sciences). I have found that, while most Christians seem doubtful about Dooyeweerd's philosophy, many non-Christians value and are attracted to his thought. Why is this? Perhaps nobody else provides such a sound basis for interdisciplinarity and rich complexity that is able to address the real problems we face today. Some find the centrality of Meaning attractive, while others fïnd the ground-motives useful. Dooyeweerd (1955, I, vii) suggested that "It is a matter of life and death for this young philosophy that ... scholars in all fields of science seek to put it to work in their own specialty." The approach illustrated and discussed in this article might present Dooyeweerdian thought with an historically unique opportunity to enter the mainstream. The opportunity is that Dooyeweerdian thought can become known and properly explored within the mainstream of academie thought and practice, that it can be linked into others' thought, and that it can become valued, not in providing an alternative that replaces, but in providing a perspective that enriches.
