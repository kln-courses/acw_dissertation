NE LS ON Tao Yuanming's Sashes: Or The Gendering of Immortality ABSTRACT A visual image based on a literary text, it is generally understood, is not just an illustration but an interpretation-a particular con- struction of the text. Such a visual interpretation may be consid- ered a nonverbal form of literary criticism, parallel to written commentaries; and some striking correspondences between con- temporary written and visual interpretations of literary texts- between poetry criticism and poetry illustration-have been explored in recent studies. This essay calls attention to a less well recognized phenomenon: the degree to which pictorial interpre- tations of written texts may diverge from the corpus of written commentary. A familiar image of the poet Tao Yuanming, origi- nating in Song and often replicated in later times, serves here as a case in point. This construction of Tao's likeness, which incor- porates Buddhist, Daoist, and feminine imagery, has inflected the pictorial traditions surrounding him with meanings quite distinct from the themes emphasized in written commentaries.

NE LS ON Tao ruanming'n Sashes: Or, The Gendering of Immortality SINCE THE SONG DYNASTY (960-1279) if not before, a distinctive pictorial convention has been used for representing the great East- ernJin poet and recluse Tao Yuanming Fxl l HA (Tao Qian A$ ;!, 365-427). A well-known painting by the Song court artist Liang Kai X * of around 1200 now in the National Palace Museum in Taibei, The Scholar of the Eastern Fence (Dongli gaoshi . 4 d '), is an example of the type (figs. 1, 2).' A goodlooking smooth-featured man of young middle age, the poet is shown in three-quarter view striding to the left, a walking stick in one hand, a chrysanthe- mum in the other. His dress is elegant and informal: a long outer robe tied across his chest, a short fur cape, sandals, a loose scarf on his head. Clothes and sashes swish and flutter behind him. He holds his flower up at face level, but his attention seems directed to some object in the distance ahead. Pic- tures of Tao in a standing posture almost always have several of the attributes or characteristics seen here: chrysanthemum, headscarf, staff, mobile stance, trailing robes and sashes, lifted chin and dis- tant gaze. This is a standard Tao Yuanming image, and-with various backgrounds and settings or with none, silhouetted against a blank ground- functions as his portrait in the visual tradition (figs. 3-5).2 These Tao Yuanming portraits stand apart from the main traditions of representing distin- guished men in portraitlike guises that had become established by the Song dynasty. The portraits of twenty-four estimable officials (Gongchen xh E ) that adorned the Lingyan At ;2 Hall in the Tang capital city of Chang'an, painted by Yan Liben Fg v 4 (d. 673) with eulogies written by Emperor Taizong i r (r. 626-49), represent an important early model for the genre. Though the originals are lost, stone engravings made after them in 1090 show them to be a row of sober, dignified standing figures.3 Northern Song portraits of writers and scholars are in the same mode; a fine extant example is the anonymous album of portraits of five Northern Song scholar- officials, all octogenarians, who gathered in Nanjing in the 1 050s. The work goes by the name of the Five Old Men of Suiyang (Suiyang wulao e 1% L *); it was executed before 1056, the date of the earliest colophon. Feng Ping ,U +, typical of them all, is illustrated here (fig. 6).4 Scant of setting, action, and emotion, the image projects a model Confucian sobriety. His posture is enclosed, with restrained gestures, elbows close to the body, and shoulders slightly hunched forward, as if burdened by respon- sibility or deferring to a superior; his clothing is proper and just so, his demeanor and expression composed and severe. Considering that at the moment he is supposed to be at ease, his decorum is all the more revealing and meaningful. The twelfth- century portrait in the Cleveland Museum of Dazhi ,k -N (1048-1116), a priest of the Lii (Vinaya) sect of Buddhism, though belonging to a somewhat dif- ferent genre and serving a ceremonial function, rep- resents the same impressive, reassuring ideal (fig. 7). A laudatory inscripton by Liu Tao 'J1 A, (late 1 1 th- early 12th centuries) emphasizes his air of dignity and composure: Uprightness and gravity he possessed in full, His countenance was like his mind; 3</page><page sequence="4">SUSAN E.

Several handscrolls and albums illustrating this text are extant, associated with the late Northern Song painter Li Gonglin ffi o 4 (ca. 1041-1106) and with later artists working in his tradition. The Nine Songs tell of deities and spirits-the Greater and Lesser Masters of Fate, the Princess and Lady of the Xiang River, and others-and their celestial roamings and divine passions. In the illustrations these exotic divinities coast and soar among clouds and waves, robes swishing and sashes tracing the breeze. The Princess of the Xiang (XiangJun 4n4k), for one, flower in hand, walks on water; her stance, in a drift of coiling scarves, is spirited and elegant (fig. 10).7 Qu Yuan appears as a frontispiece to these compositions, and in sharp contrast with them: standing with shoulders burdened and arms thor- oughly sleeved, only a finger or two protruding, an image of the workaday, here-and-now literatus. Liang Kai's Tao Yuanming presents an image entirely unlike this-indeed, he resembles the divine Princess of the Xiang River rather more than he does his fellow poet Qu Yuan. His smooth features and light, mobile silhouette recall other types from Chi- nese pictorial art as well: flying immortals, gracefully beribboned Buddhist divinities (figs. 1 1-14).8 In terms of the familiar, established forms of traditional Chinese pictorial art, Tao's portrait situates itself not only with the literati but among girls and god- desses, Daoist transcendents, and bodhisattvas. The present essay is an inquiry into this curious fact. I will argue that these feminine and divine allu- sions represent an interpretation of Tao's thought- they are, in other words, a kind of literary criticism or exegesis in visual form. This visually proffered interpretation does not dwell on the ideas of reclu- sion, simplicity, contentment, and Confucian virtue usually associated with him-themes that pervade the written traditions of Tao Yuanming criticism. Rather, it emphasizes other aspects of the poet's writing: preoccupations with death, thoughts of escape or transcendence, unconsummated yearn- ings. This is an interesting alternative way of looking at Tao Yuanming, his works, and his legacy. It is also interesting as evidence of the visual artist's mea- sure of independence from the traditions of literary commentary-even when treating a literary subject.9 I have paired the concepts of femininity and divinity here; the overlapping of the two in the Chi- nese visual tradition, though sometimes recognized, remains an important subject for investigation, and aspects of it will be considered here. OTHERWORLDLY THOUGHTS Liang Kai's Scholar of the Eastern Fence is not sim- ply a picture of the man, for there is a narrative sub- sumed within the image. Tao is shown at a moment he described in one of his best-known poems, the fifth in his suite of Drinking Wine: Twenty Poems (Yinjiu ershi shou W`5 -::- + t ), which, he tells us in a preface, he wrote in the evenings "all alone with my shadow" over some excellent wine. The poem opens with a quatrain about the hubbub of local traf- fic passing by his cottage-traffic that he does not hear; in the world of his mind-his "detached mind"-he is in a remote, unpeopled place. He goes on to describe it: Gathering chrysanthemums by the eastern fence I catch sight of South Mountain in the distance; The mountain air is lovely as the sun sets And flocks of flying birds return together. There's an essential meaning in all this- I would explain it but can't find the words. 10 It is the central couplet that is visualized in Liang Kai's painting: "Gathering chrysanthemums by the eastern fence / I catch sight of South Mountain in the distance." Chrysanthemums were believed to have medic- inal properties. Following a custom traditionally practiced on the "Double Ninth," the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, Tao used to steep their petals in wine for a longevity potion. This autumnal cus- tom is often associated in his poetry with thoughts of mortality and oblivion, and as he gathers chrysan- themums in the fifth Drinking poem Tao is indeed thinking about wanings and endings. The day, like the season, is declining; it is evening, with the birds returning to their roost.

Province-Tao's glimpse of it caps and clinches the valedictory mood. Mount Lu was famous as a her- mits' retreat and an immortals' abode, and Tao else- where speaks of it metaphorically as his final resting place. Its sight moves him to transmundane imagin- ings to which he alludes with a haunting elusiveness, "losing" or "forgetting the words" (wangyan ) to describe them. Liang Kai has pictured Tao poised in this moment of serene awareness, lifting his chry- santhemum as if saluting the numinous mountain, his robes quivering as if to express his state of mind. That is in fact what they are doing. Tao's silhou- ette-posture, gesture, dress-represents an inter- pretation of the nature of his insights at this moment. For Tao's figure here, Liang Kai has drawn on an earlier portrayal of the poet: Li Gonglin's illustra- tion of another of Tao's poems, the great "Returning Home" (Guiqulai ; -A- *) prose-poem in which Tao describes his decision to leave his official job and his return home to a life of privacy and indepen- dence in which he could be himself. Li's handscroll illustration of "Returning Home" was well known at court in the Southern Song; a version in the Freer Gallery, Yuanming Returning to Seclusion (Yuan- mingguiyin N1 'J Pk), is generallyjudged to be an early and close copy of Li Gonglin's composition." It presents a series of scenes alternating with sec- tions of the text, with Tao's figure appearing eight times, engaged in various activities he described in the prose-poem. The seventh Tao figure in Li's scroll is the prototype for Liang's image (fig. 15). Tao appears here on a hilltop overlooking a stretch of water with a cliff and clouds beyond. As in Liang Kai's painting, he is shown in three-quarter view, walking by a tree, staff in hand, facing a distant pros- pect, clothes blowing behind him. It was not by chance that Liang Kai appropri- ated this particular Tao figure, for it expresses an idea well suited to his purposes. The corresponding section of the "Returning Home" text-the closing lines-is, like the central couplet of the fifth Drink- ing poem, a valedictory image: So little time are we granted human form in the world! Let us then follow the inclinations of the heart ... Rather on some fine morning to walk alone, Now planting my staff to take up a hoe, Or climbing the east hill and whistling long Or composing verses beside the clear stream: So I manage to accept my lot until the ultimate homecoming. Rejoicing in Heaven's command, what is there to doubt?"2 8</page><page sequence="9">TAO YUANMING IS SASHES -,^1t-w H . *_ . U I,X t 1 ' A,:t: ;:: .- .:; i:/ FIG. 16.

Li Gonglin's staff-holding, windblown Tao on the east hill is an image of the poet engaged in thoughts of death and release. His long whistle, a practice aiming at communication with spirits and alignment with nature, orients him away from human con- cerns. His mind is turned to the next, the "ultimate homecoming"; his forward momentum has an air of lightness and freedom, as if passing from a state of Confucian eremitism to a more footloose Daoist dis- engagement. His agitated clothing, suggestive of whistling, of flight, and of faraway thoughts, is the medium for this message. It is a message very much in keeping with Tao's experience at the eastern fence. By invoking Li Gonglin's image of the poet contemplating death and release, Liang Kai amplifies his own of Tao catching sight of South Mountain. The generalized airiness seen in these figures is pervasive throughout Tao Yuanming pictorial imag- ery: a breeze follows him even where, in terms of the material world around him, it seems to make little sense. Though just two of the Tao Yuanming fig- ures in the Freer Returning to Seclusion scroll-one of him arriving by boat at the beginning, in addition to the east hill image near the end-have trailing gar- ments, in many later illustrations of the poem most or all of them do. In a copy of the Freer handscroll in the National Palace Museum in Taibei, every one of the Tao Yuanming figures from one end of the scroll to the other has been zapped by the wind. Those walking around out of doors all have streaming sashes and puffed-out sleeves; even those that are seated or indoors have short scarf-ends fluttering edgily around them-as, for example, in the scene of a drinking party where Tao's sashes twitch while those of his companions lie inert (fig. 16). Tao's sashes also wriggle or fly throughout many of the scenes in a collaborative Ming Returning Home scroll in Liaoning (fig. 17) and in a late version attributed to Qiu Ying et - (ca. 1495-1552) in the National Palace Museum.13 It is only Tao whose clothing is agitated in this way; friends, family, and servants occupying the same spaces are unaffected. Similarly, in the Scholar of the Eastern Fence, to judge from the foliage it is not a windy day, nor does Tao's stride look brisk enough to account for the broad swish and flutter of his clothes. Simply put, the air around his body seems dynamic; it is an aura, and imputes to him a measure of divinity. 9</page><page sequence="10">SUSAN E. NELSON II &gt; FIG. i8.

Anne Hollander has discussed similar effects in European painting "when an other- worldly wind begins to assert its power on the gar- ment for aesthetic purposes other than showing motion or gravitation": Flem-ish and German artists of the Late Gothic period show how the drapery of figures may by itself invest an image with visionary force, as when the cloth is made to whip up and swirl with- out any apparent physical force exerted on it. Certain scenes from this period will combine the mundane figures of donors, whose clothes hang and lie in folds, with those of saints and angels, whose garments fly, subject to fits of inexplicable energy.... It clearly seemed appropriate to the creators and beholders of such paintings that celestial drapery float but that earthly clothing ... obey the common law of gravity.14 It is such a "visionary force" (qi , in the Chinese context) that often seems to envelop the earthly gar- ments of Tao Yuanming. ROAMING WITH THE IMMORTALS Tao's breezy silhouette associates him with Chinese divinities of many sorts that have been pictured in a stream of divine energy: goddesses and river nymphs, traveling shamans and wonder-working sages, bodhi- sattvas and angels-seekers and finders of immortal- ity or enlightenment. Underlying the airiness of all of them is the idea of celestial flight, a human fantasy that knows few regional or cultural bounds. In the Chi- nese tradition, flight has been an accomplishment reserved for immortal beings, and at the same time a route toward the prize of immortality-overlapping ideas that may be said to acknowledge the quasi-sex- ual coexistence of fulfillment and desire. A magic voyage is the subject of one of the earli- est Chinese paintings extant, a painting on silk of around the third century B.C.E. found in the Chang- sha region in the then state of Chu (fig. 18). A stand- ing male figure rides on the deeply curved, boat- shaped spine of a dragon. A fish swims along beneath the dragon while a crested bird perches on its tail, demarking the aqueous and aerial realms.'5 Seen in profile and slightly from the rear, robed and capped, the man carries at his waist a rodlike object-perhaps the long staff or sword mentioned as a shaman's attribute in the Nine Songs of roughly the same time and region as the painting.'6 His feet are not quite planted on the dragon's back; he appears to hover above it, and an umbrellalike can- opy likewise hovers above his head, neither sup- ported nor hanging by any visible device. The voy- age is evidently a rapid one; the pendant tassels of the canopy stream backwards, and the figure's cap- strings fly back behind his neck too. The scene sug- gests the voyage by dragon-mount or dragon-boat described in one of the Nine Songs: 10</page><page sequence="11">TAO YUANMING S SASHES The stream runs fast through the stony shallows And my flying dragon wings swiftly above it."7 Flying robes and sashes are common in Han dynasty pictures of humanlike sprites who whiz around in the qi-filled realms-the cosmic force fields-depicted on coffin surfaces and tomb walls.'8 They are also characteristic of the anthropomorphic immortals of various kinds pictured in Six Dynasties art, such as the flying angels (apsaras) of the Bud- dhist cave-temples at Yungang, Longmen, and Dun- huang, or the flying celestials of the Xishanqiao and Dengxian tombs.'9 Fluttering sashes remain a pri- mary pictorial device for representing divinity throughout later times. A hanging scroll in Taibei by Liang Kai's contemporary Ma Yuan f it (fl. ca. 1190-1230) of an immnortal riding a dragon through space, sashes flying, is a latter-day version of the Chu picture of 1500 years earlier (fig. 19).2? The idea of flight is expressed here in a complexly spatial and dynamic way, and the scene throbs with super- natural energy. The sage and his dragon twist and flex as they course through the clouds, while a gnome-servant speeds toward his master bringing his potent dragon-headed staffi Every part of the figures' clothes, the staff's trimmings, or the dragon's body that can curl, swish, or snap in the air is doing so. The dragon-boat poem belongs to a body of poetry on "roaming immortals" or "roaming with the immortals" (youxian shi * IJ4 *); the lines quoted are from the "Princess of the Xiang" section of the Nine Songs. Visions of celestial journeys appear in other poems in the Songs of Chu collection too, among them "Traveling Afar" (Yuanyou i#-;#), "Heavenly Questions" (Tianwen X FUJ ), and others of the Nine Songs.2' The "roaming immortals" genre was particularly popular in the early Southern Dynasties period. The literary elite of those days were preoccupied with the notions of immortality and divine flight, and many of them took drugs and practiced exercises aimed at the extension of life and the attainment of special powers. Among the powers they aspired to was flight, and various drugs believed to bring about the lightening of body weight-an important part of the process of becoming an airwor- thy immortal-were much sought after.22 ~~~~~ 7 ~ A FIG. 19. Ma ruan. Riding a Dragon, hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, 1 08. 1 x 52.6 cm. National Palace Museum, Taibei. In time these preoccupations subsided, and "roaming with the immortals" poetry yielded place to other literary modes.23 But the language and imagery of celestial beings and magic j'ourneys proved to have a very long half-life; they remain commnon throughout later writing, even in texts only 11</page><page sequence="12">SUSAN E. NELSON tenuously connected with immortality ideas. David Hawkes has remarked on this phenomenon: the patterns of thought associated with what one might call the cosmological approach to art became so ingrained that they affected all litera- ture, not only those kinds whose themes sug- gested it. As an example he cites Luji FA (261-303), who, in his "Prose-poem on Literature" (Wenfu ; RA), moves in a few lines from the reasonable "the writer contemplates the mystery of the universe" to the fan- tastical "his spirit gallops to the eight ends of the uni- verse . . . Floating on the heavenly lake, he swims along; plunging into the nether spring, he immerses himself." As Hawkes explains it, "The metaphor ... treats the creative writer as a magician who moves through the universe like the mystics and shamans of old in their celestialjourneys."24 Supernatural imag- ery, as he says elsewhere, "formed part of the stock- in-trade of all Chinese poets."25 And so it remained long after Lu Ji's time, indeed throughout the entire history of traditional Chinese literature. After all, the supernatural was immanent, for longevity and immortality were viewed as a continuum rather than as pertaining to clearly distinct realms. Wolfgang Bauer has described this continuum in connection with the life-conserving practice of eremitism. The process begins, so to speak, with Tao Yuanming; that is, with the hermit's resignation from leading posts, com- bined with a preference for living in smaller towns or villages rather than in the busy capital. As a next step, the hermit might leave the town or village and choose to dwell in the countryside.... He may then go even further, abandoning his family and fleeing into wholly uncultivated areas, dwelling alone in the mountains and marshes.... The subsequent steps are imaginative rather than real: the hermit bids farewell to mankind alto- gether, vanishing into distant, fabulous countries or islands. . . . Many of the Chinese immortals (hsien) may be counted among such "hermits" ("earthly hermits" ti-hsien). The final stage . . . is reached when the hermit leaves the world entirely, when he ascends to heaven. . . . This stage is necessarily associated with the idea of death, although this is rarely expressed; or it may even be interpreted, by means of inversion, as an overcoming of death.26 Given the porous borders between mortal life and immortality in Chinese thought, beings could be imagined as belonging to, or between, both realms, and the visual imagery of immortals in the later Six Dynasties period bespeaks just such an understand- ing. Just as Luji's hero was at once philosopher and magician, pictured figures might combine mortal and supernatural features. As Audrey Spiro has shown, transcendent beings in Six Dynasties funer- ary reliefs shed the feathers and wings of their more archaic manifestations and took on portraitlike faces, while the figures of eminent historical gentle- men such as those portrayed in the Xishanqiao tomb near Nanjing developed the lightness and insubstan- tiality of ethereal beings. Eulogistic language about real people might use the imagery of spiritlike airi- ness: in Liu Yiqing's g'J ffi "New Account of Tales of the World" (Shishuo xinyu efT 'A St T ), Wang Xizhi - -2 (303-6 1) and other luminaries are described as drifting like clouds, light and grace- ful, airily soaring.27 In the Southern Dynasties imag- ination, in other words, praiseworthy mortals were sometimes portrayed as the light-bodied transcen- dents many of them aspired to become, and recluses who went off in quest of immortality might be pic- tured as if they had arrived at their goal. Hawkes speaks of such imagined celestial jour- neys as flights to prolong life,28 and Helmut Wil- helm calls them "wanderings of the spirit on the lookout for another life, for continuing in another way, another place."29 It goes without saying that, for all their pipe-dream exoticism and the endless sensual elaborations in which some of them indulge, "roaming with the immortals" poems reflect entirely natural, urgent human anxieties about life and death. Tao Yuanming's own poetic voice was very dif- ferent from that of the "roaming immortals" poets of 12</page><page sequence="13">TAO YUANMING S SASHES - FIG. 20.

E I.st .E \0]^ Sk.V his own and earlier times and indeed came to sup- plant it; his oeuvre stands at the beginning of the long later tradition of writing about real landscapes and personal feelings in simple, natural language. All the same, death was much on his mind, and he too sometimes entertained fanciful visions of divine flight. His parable about the secret utopia of the "Peach Blossom Spring" (Taohua yuan t, 4 ends with this image: I want to tread upon the thin thin air And rise up high to find my own kind.30 In "Drinking Alone in the Rainy Season" (Lianyu duyin it r 'ib k), after musing on drinking and on death, Tao writes: Is heaven so far from this after all? Nothing tops the one who trusts the True. The cloud-high crane with wonderful wings Can reach the ends of the earth in a moment of time. The cloud-high crane is Tao's image of drunken immortality, though he was aware that immortality was not his lot.3' Elsewhere he wrote about leaving for South Mountain, associated with transcendence and immortality: "On and on, where should I wish to go? / My old home is there on South Mountain." These lines suggest a transmundane spirit journey, and Tao's airily poised attitude as he faces South Mountain in Liang Kai's painting is entirely consis- tent with such an idea. Desire or aspiration is here expressed as a projection of a wishfully fulfilled self- image: the visual metaphor of flight presents him as a poet contemplating transcendent matters, like the sage in Luji's "Prose-poem on Literature." Super- natural imagery, clearly enough, was part of the stock-in-trade of the pictorial artist as well as the poet. LOVE OBJECTS The language and visual imagery to which Audrey Spiro directs our attention, casting mortal sages as "light and airy" divinities, is distinctly feminine imagery; and indeed, one of the most striking and curious things about Tao Yuanming's portrait is its femininity. He drifts lightly across the ground with sashes silkily trailing, a flower in his delicately pointed fingers; his silhouette resembles nothing so much as that of the court beauty presenting herself to her prince in Gu Kaizhi's 'I '3. - (ca. 344-406) Admonitions of the Ladies' Instructress (Nushi zhen 1*t A) scroll (fig. 20).32 She, too, glides hopefully leftward, sashes trailing behind and curling in front of her; her torso and head are similarly tilted, chin 13</page><page sequence="14">SUSAN E.

Also Tao-like is the beauty in another composi- tion traditionally attributed to Gu Kaizhi, a hand- scroll illustrating the prose-poem "The Nymph of the Luo River" (Luoshenfu Il,4P) (fig. 21). The poem, written in 222 by Cao Zhi Iti (192-232), tells a story of unfulfilled romance between a prince and a ravishing river fairy. Several versions of this composition are extant today; none of them ante- dates the Song dynasty, but they retain many ele- ments of Six Dynasties style.33 In the section shown here, from the version in Beijing, the nymph appears surrounded by a dragon, a hazy moon, chrysanthemums and a miniature pine tree- attributes that, along with the whispery lightness of her figure, are meant to illustrate Cao Zhi's poetic description: Her body soars lightly like a startled swan, Gracefully, like a dragon in flight, In splendor brighter than the autumn chrysanthe- mum, In bloom more flourishing than the pine in spring; Dim as the moon mantled in filmy clouds, Resdess as snow whirled by the driving wind.34 Both grace and flight are suggested by the airy motion of the goddess's sleeves and skirts, and espe- cially by the ribbonlike sashes that detach themselves from her frame and open it out to the space around. The poetic imagery underlying Gu Kaizhi's conception of femininity goes back well before Cao Zhi's time to such sources as the ethereal dancing girls in Fu Yi's 4 At (ca. 35-ca. 90) "Rhapsody on the Dance": Coloredjackets with flying sashes are adorned with dainty gauze.... With every puff of a gentle breeze They send forth the sweet scent of pollia.... Gossamer gowns blow in the breeze, Long sleeves tangle and twine together ... They flutter about like hovering swallows, And soar into the air like starded swans.35 Earlier still, there are the dancing beauties of Sima Xiangru's i] J4 -Au (179-117 B.C.E.) verses, weightless dream lovers like the goddesses of the Xiang and Luo Rivers. Their fluttering, drifting scarves and ribbons seem almost to be amorously fingering the viewer's imagination: Long and trailing, full and flowing ... Flying aprons and dangling sashes, 14</page><page sequence="15">TAO YUANMING S SASHES Flap and flutter, swirl and sway, Surge and billow, rustle and swish, Grazing thoroughwort and basil below, Brushing feathered canopies above ... Vaguely visualized, dimly descried, Apparitions, it seems, of goddesses.36 From Gu Kaizhi's time on, dream girls and river nymphs-filmy, sylphlike beings-have been pic- tured in the wafting clothes and lightsome attitudes described in early texts like these. Lightly breasting the wind, the Eastern Fence scholar has the same ethereal air; and the coincidentally shared imagery of chrysanthemum and pine adds a further, uncanny correspondence between the poet and the Luo River nymph. Were it not for the matter of gender (implicit anyway, given the gender-free Chinese syntax), Cao Zhi's description of the nymph quoted above-and Gu Kaizhi's illustration-would be only a few removes into the empyrean from the buoyant girlish figure of Liang Kai's Tao Yuanming.37 After the Six Dynasties period the delineation of figures in general became more corporeal, and the drapery of beautiful women came to conform more closely to the shape of the body within and the tug of gravity without. The court ladies painted on the walls in early eighth-century tombs near Xi'an or on a screen in the Sh6soin in Nara have real mass; so do those in a copy of a scroll by the court painter Zhou Fang JAJ H (fl. ca. 740-800), Ladies with Flowers in Their Hair (Zanhua shi'nu t4t-*) in the Liao- ning Provincial Museum.38 Their robes have palpa- ble mass too, draped over shoulders and arms and hanging earthward. But these more substantial women still share posture and gesture with Tao- particularly the central figure in Zhou Fang's scroll, as she contemplates the blossom in her hand (fig. 22). Rare is the painting of a mortal male figure- poet, scholar, official-whose physical articulation resembles that of the Eastern Fence poet as closely as does this beauty in her garden. And it should be noted that divine women continue to wear floating sashes in the Tang, keeping much of their transpar- ent airiness as their mortal sisters put on weight.

Yakushiji in Nara is a celestial counterpart to the pal- ace lady in Zhou Fang's garden scene, or to the beauties on the Sh6s6in screen: similar in physique and posture, as her body and attention center on the symbolic treasure in her hand (fig. 13). The myste- rious energies flowing through her trailing scarves, though, proclaim her divine status. By the time Liang Kai painted Tao's picture, the feminine and divine implications of the fluttering silhouette were very clearly established.39 Along with his sashes, Tao's chrysanthemum is a common feature of his iconography, to be found in bust-length portraits and in paintings that show him seated as well as standing, such as an anonymous Yuan painting in the Palace Museum in Taibei; a small picture by Lu Zhi a a; (1496-15 76) of himself 15</page><page sequence="16">SUSAN E.

To be sure, scholars appreciated flowers too- their beauty and the virtues or values that many of them symbolized-and many paintings show gentle- men meditating thoughtfully on flowers. In most cases, though, the flowers are growing in a garden or arranged in a vase, and the man admires them at a distance, without touching them.4' Indeed, the appreciation of flowers is most commonly suggested through paintings of the flower alone, without figure or setting-paintings that are themselves objects of hands-off visual appreciation-with the scholar's responses conveyed in the form of inscribed mus- ings. Pictures of scholars other than Tao actually handling flowers are unusual, and most of them date from Qing times; an example is the painting Luo Ping 1- did for his friend Yi'an gX in 1798 of a man holding and sniffing a spray of plum blossoms (fig. 25).42 This gentleman cuts an odd figure with his jaded, distracted air, moodily ugly and heavy of stance in his stiff robe, posed by a bizarre shell of hollowed rock. His physical contact with the flower is a further eccentricity. Holding a flower, in other words, is character- istically feminine or devotional, and there is also a distinctly feminine or devout manner of doing so: stem held lightly between thumb and forefinger in a delicate pinching gesture. This is the way women, immortals, and Buddhist figures generally hold their various floral attributes; it is the gesture Tao invariably uses, very different from the blunt grip flower-holding gentlemen like Luo Ping's I FIG. 24.

Held this way, a flower does not speak of scholarly virtues and gentleman gardeners but of other spheres of meaning, ones consonant with themes of divinity and desire. In the hand of a worldly charmer such as the central figure in Zhou Fang's scroll, it is a metaphor both for the perfection of her beauty and for its fragility (fig. 22).4' The sprig held by the age- less, immortal Princess of the Xiang is a metaphor for transcendence (fig. 10)-as in the Nine Songs passage where the seeker, "twisting a spray of cas- sia," aches for union with the deity.44 Herb-gather- ing transcendents of Daoist lore lucky enough to find a lingzhi 3E X, the mushroom of immortality, hold it up the same way (fig. 26).45 Donors and worshipers in Buddhist painting are frequently pictured approaching a divine being with flower in hand in a gesture of offering or praise, using the thumb-and-forefinger gesture-as does the monk from a cave at Kizil in Central Asia of around the fifth century in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, or the king in the Five Dynasties cave no. 98 at Dunhuang (fig. 27).46 As an expression of votive sentiment, the small drawing of a hand holding a flower Tao's way, between two fingers-a fragment of a Buddhist painting on silk of the eighth or ninth 17</page><page sequence="18">SUSAN E.

To quote further: Skimming the water in my cassia boat ... I look for the goddess, but she does not come yet ... North I go, drawn by my flying dragon ... I waft my magic across the Great River. I waft my magic, but it does not reach her. The lady is sad, and sighs for me; And my tears run down over cheeks and chin: I am choked with longing for my lady ... The stream runs fast through the stony shallows And my flying dragon wings swiftly above it.48 These verses on the "Princess of the Xiang River" and Cao Zhi's "Nymph of the Luo River" quoted above are early and influential poems in the tradition of cantos on river goddesses, a genre of sensual poetry about the amours of nymphs and princes. Airy and breezy images, such as the winds that spin the snowdrifts in Cao Zhi's poem, pervade these verses and have an insistent presence in the cantos of later times as well. They suggest cosmic harmonies and divine flight; but there is also an erotic side to them for, as these poems make abun- dantly clear, the associations of wind in Chinese cul- ture include the idea of the winds of passion. Wind is the ray of desire beamed by the beauty: "The wind pulled at her precious clothes"; "Wind from her netted gauze underskirt stirs up a light dust"; "In front of the railing, the wind sends off a pervasive fragrance"; "Cold and pink, blown upward by the wind: peach flower petals." It is the lover's lust and its consummation: "Willow belts [a sign of the king] shaking in the wind"; "Moon color threads through the hanging screen; wind enters the bamboo"; "blinded by pleasure, his heart proved inadequate, / The wind blows." Wind is also the shiver of frustration and loss: "the pillow [is] cold, / The wind is delicate, rain falls in a misty veil"; "Songs and flute airs from thejade storied building, / Their sound severed, have already followed the wind"; "In green aspens, the wind grows still, con- gealing my idle resentment"; "My fleeting life's lengthy resentments whirl up like tumbleweed."49 Love poetry of this sort is a specialized genre, to be sure; but the theme of erotic yearning found there, expressed in the Luo River nymph's wind- ruffled silhouette, is not altogether incompatible with the yearning of the windblown scholar of the Eastern Fence. The bridge between them-between transcendental and sexual longing-is crossed by the Song poet Li Qingzhao 4 . (1084-ca. 1 151 ) in a well-known lyric, "Drunk in the Flowery Shade" (Zui huayin 0 t1 !*). This poem is a play on Tao's fifth Drinking poem that gives it a dis- tinctly erotic twist. Li is writing, she tells us, on the Double Ninth; it is twilight, and she raises a cup at the eastern fence. Her mind, though, is not on South Mountain, but on incense, her jade pillow, and silk bedcurtains stirred by the west wind-an emanation i8</page><page sequence="19">TAO YUANMINGIS SASHES of her absent lover. Overcome with yearning, she feels "more fragile than the yellow chrysanthe- mum."50 To picture Li Qingzhao's variation on the theme of Tao Yuanming's fifth Drinking poem, it would take but a slight variation on the painting of the Scholar of the Eastern Fence. The substitution for Tao of a figure like the Luo River fairy or the woman from the Admonitions scroll would do it (figs. 21, 20): lightly erect in posture, her hems, sleeves, and scarves floating up and out around her-"cold and pink, blown upward by the wind: peach flower petals." Let us pursue a bit further our hypothetical transformation of Tao Yuanming into Li Qingzhao at the eastern fence. Li Qingzhao's distant gaze is fixed not on South Mountain, symbol of other- worldly yearnings, but on a far-off object of amorous desire. The differences between the mountain and the lover are not as absolute as they may at first appear, for love objects had long been a metaphor for transcendental aspirations, and the trajectory of the seeker's desire a metaphor for the journey to the realms of the immortals. David Hawkes has elucidated the correspon- dences between the male shaman's vain pursuit, "choked with longing," of the river goddess in his dragon-drawn boat in the "Princess of the Xiang" and magic flights undertaken with the aim of tran- scending mortality such as that described in Sima Xiangru's "Great Man" prose-poem (Darenfu k PA) of the second century B.C.E.5' Mystic journeys were often associated with the "quest of the god- dess," and the beauty herself stands for thejourney's fulfillment. After all, the erotic climax, petite mort, has modeled death and immortality in many tradi- tions, as drunken ecstasy did for Tao Yuanming ("I forget heaven," he wrote, drunk, "but is heaven so far from this after all?"52 ). Finding and uniting with the goddess was to be the poet's own transfigura- tion. The cult of Xiwangmu 5 X -, the Queen Mother of the West, as Suzanne Cahill sums it up, centered on the conjoined longing for eternal life and perfect love.53 Donald Holzman explains Ruan Ji's 1t - (210-63) poems of yearning for beautiful immortals in terms of a thwarted fantasy of becom- ing one with them: "The sadness he feels because he is not able to unite with them is, on one level, sad- ness for his own mortality."54 And the love he feels for them is love for the immortality that these divine females represent in their very bodies. The goddess- like silhouette of the far-gazing Tao Yuanming expresses this fancied union. Tao's image in the Eastern Fence painting-on the one hand voyaging, on the other feminized-conflates the seeker and the goal. Indeed, a gender shift is implicit in the court- ship between men and divine women; as Stephen Bokenkamp has shown, since human seekers -stand in a subordinate relation to divinities, the mortal male suitor of a goddess assumes a feminine role.55 Though he may pursue her, he will also learn wom- anly ways of attending, waiting, and receiving. There is a feminine dimension to the very practice of retirement itself: separated from the outside world within the "closed gate" of the reclusive home and garden, the hermit adopts the sheltered inward life of the neiren 09 A, the wife or "inside person." THE BODHISATTVA The image of the feminized transcendent goes back at least to the graceful, maidenly flying immortal described in the Zhuangzi 4tI!-: there is a Holy Man living on faraway Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gende and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the four seas.56 The Daoist vision of the silky flying adept found a place in the culture of Southern Dynasties Bud- dhism, where the practices of mountain travel and mountain contemplation, suffused with old ideas about shamanistic spirit voyages, were promoted as Buddhist disciplines by the monk Huiyuan 4, i (344-416) at his Mount Lu temple community. In his "Treatise Illuminating the Buddha" (Mingfo lun % 4b Pt) Huiyuan's adherent Zong Bing A ; (375- 443) writes of sages traveling to the ends of the earth like shamans, gaining Buddhist insights and per- spectives into cosmic realms. In another essay, 19</page><page sequence="20">SUSAN E. NELSON "Introduction on Painting Landscape" (Hua shan- shui xu A o4 7JC), Zong described the journeys of the imagination he made himself while looking at landscape paintings; these were undertaken in the pursuit of Buddhist enlightenment as well.57 The imagery of flight and femininity permeates Buddhist art. The flying angels of the cave-temples at Dunhuang might be the Gushe transcendent con- verted to Buddhism, and the gracious silhouette of the standing bodhisattva also often seems airily adrift. One from an early Tang cave at Dunhuang glides forward with an offering tray; one from a panel of the seventh-century Tamamushi shrine at Haryuji in Nara holds a lotus with a thoughtful air (figs. 1 1, 12). Svelte, fringed with swaying scarves and curling hair ribbons, their bodies look fluid and weightless.58 Like goddesses and river nymphs, these standing Buddhist divinities give the impres- sion of havingjust alit or materialized out of the air. Some are actually engaged in a narrative of flight, like the cloud-borne Guanyin A* as the "guide of souls" coming to gather up the souls of the deserv- ing dead and conduct them back to heaven, a scene represented on silk banners from Dunhuang.59 Always androgynous, the Chinese bodhisattva image became increasingly feminine in Song, as in the relief of Guanyin holding a rosary at Dazu in Sichuan-a winsome girlish figure facing slightly to the left, scarves trailing behind and curling in front, body lightly arched (fig. 14).60 The description of Guanyin in the sixteenth-century novelj7ourney to the West (Xiyouji 4f* 'Z ) is very much like those of the sexy girls and goddesses invoked by Sima Xiangru, Fu Yi, and Cao Zhi in passages quoted above: Fringes of dangling pearls and jade, Scented bracelets set with lustrous treasures, Dark hair piled smoothly in a coiled-dragon bun, And elegant sashes lighdly fluttering as phoenix quills ... Her velvet skirt and golden cords Wrapped by hallowed air. With brows of new moon shape And eyes like two bright stars, Herjadelike face beams with naturaljoy, And her ruddy lips seem a flash of red.6' The sexual metamorphosis of the bodhisattva has long been recognized, though its causes-and the eroticism of the imagery-are just beginning to be investigated.62 As we have seen, feminine imagery invokes the ideas of revelation, divine wisdom, or immortality modeled by the goddess in early litera- ture. Chinese bodhisattvas-like Tao Yuanming- owe their feminine forms partly to the ancient iden- tification of women with spiritual realization and the hope of heaven. The similarity of Tao Yuanming's silhouette to images such as the Dazu bodhisattva is alight with meaning. In so nearly approximating this well-estab- lished, familiar Buddhist figure type, Tao's image presents itself as participating in some way or degree in the meanings represented by the bodhisattva. It would not be surprising to find Buddhist per- ceptions in Tao Yuanming's writings, or at least affin- ities with Buddhist thought. Buddhism was very much part of the intellectual life of the Eastern Jin period and the Mount Lu region, and many of Tao's contemporaries were involved and conversant with it. On two occasions Tao himself spoke of "illusion," a central Buddhist term and concept: the term liu- huan ;A ki "flowing illusion" appears in his poem on "Returning to My Former Residence," and meng- huan ;f k "dream-illusion," a phrase found in the Vimalakirti-nirdesa siitra, in the eighth of his Drink- ing Wine poems.63 The sentiments of disillusionment he sometimes expressed are also compatible with a Buddhist worldview. But such ideas lie at the inter- stices of Buddhist and Daoist thought, and Tao's commentators have been strongly inclined to locate them in the latter camp. They recognize in his writ- ings a mix of Confucian and Daoist ideas and debate at length-sometimes contentiously-the relative weight of his allegiance to those two schools. Bud- dhism has rarely been brought into the discussion. If the written commentaries on Tao for the most part ignore Buddhism, though, the visual record has vigorously engaged with it, drawing unmistakable connections between the poet and Buddhist imag- ery and ideas. The pose Tao assumes at the eastern fence, facing the numinous Mount Lu, is very close to the classic pose of the bodhisattva in attendance on a central image-like the ones on the Tamamushi 20</page><page sequence="21">TAO YUANMING S SASHES FIG. 29. Kichizan Minchi, Sakyamuni "raising theflower and smiling slightly," 1426, central panelfrom a seven azntzng set. Rokuoin, Kyoto. After Nihon bijutsu taikei, vol. 4 s (Tokyo, 1959-61). shrine, which adorn the doors to the icon within (fig. 12): the three-quarter view, the tilt of the face, the position of the feet, the curling of the sashes, and the flower-raising gesture. Indeed, the close similarity between Tao's pose and that of the bodhisattva Guanyin as Padmapani- carrying a lotus, symbol of rebirth in the paradise of the Pure Land-implies an equivalence between their two floral attributes. To be sure, the benefits offered by Tao's medicinal chrysanthemum are triv- ial compared to those represented by the bodhisat- tva's lotus. Since longevity is linked in Chinese thought with transcendence and immortality, though, both flowers ultimately symbolize other- worldly aspirations, and Tao's bodhisattva-like pose expresses the hope of a lotuslike transcendence and release. It also draws on other familiar Buddhist stories of lifted flowers that stand for the teaching and its truth. One popularized in the collectionWumen guan A f6 o (The Gateless Pass, 1228) is known as "raising the flower and smiling slightly" (nianhua weixiao 4X, `_ i, X). It tells of the moment during his sermon on Vulture Peak when Sakyamuni "held up a flower and displayed it to the assembled multi- tude" as a symbol of ultimate truth."4 A painting dated 1426 by the Japanese artist Kichizan Mincho + OA L (1352-143 1) is a rare illustration of this event, and there is reason to believe it was modeled on a Chinese prototype (fig. 29). Seated on a lotus throne in the clouds, Sakyamuni holds a flower in his right hand in front of his bared chest; his eyes, like Tao's, seem to be looking through rather than at it. His disciple Kasyapa stands to the right, clasping his hands in delight while a smile of understanding spreads over his ugly, likable face.65 The raised flower as wordless symbol of truth plays an active role in another well-known episode recounted in the Vimalakirti-nirdesa siutra, during the great philosophical debate between the sage Vimalakirti and the bodhisattva Ma-njusri.66 The text tells of a "heavenly woman" (tiannu :k&amp;, goddess or deva) taking part with Vimalakirti to argue the case for the doctrine of nonduality. She is herself an extremely advanced being, having been in the ser- vice of 92 million billion Buddhas and having attained "irreversibility"-the point of no return in her progress toward salvation. In the course of the debate, she makes a point by scattering flowers on the monk ?riputra. The flowers stand for human attachments, which ?riputra, as yet not enlight- ened, is unable to shake off. Though these sticky flowers are illusions, at the same time they are instru- ments of revelation, part of the argument by which truth is taught. (Indeed, gender itself is an illusion, as the goddess goes on to demonstrate by swapping genders with the monk-who thus in fact becomes, albeit under protest, a feminized seeker.) From an 21</page><page sequence="22">SUSAN E. NELSON FIG. 30. Liu Songnian, Goddess Offering Flowers, detail of an album painting, ink and color on silk, 26.6 x 51.4 cm. National Palace Museum, Taibei. early date Vimalakirti's debate was a very popular subject for illustration, and the goddess with her flowers often figures in the scene.6 In a fragmentary but particularly fine example, Goddess Offrering Flowers (Tiannu xianhua :k-&amp;-k` ) by Liu Songnian 'Ji24-(ca. 1 150-after 1225, a contem- porary of Liang Kai's in the late Song Academy), the scarf-lightened, flower-presenting frame of the allur- ing bodhisattva-goddess is, again, much like Tao YuanIing's (fig. 30).68 The general guise of a gliding, breeze-lightened figure holding a single sprig daintily aloft, whether to contemplate, scatter, offer, or display, is a well- established idiom bringing together concepts of femininity, purity, salvation, and transcendence. Tao Yuanming at the eastern fence is an image con- structed to suggest these ideas. It represents a visual commentary on Tao's thoughts about an "ultimate homecoming" on the east hill or at his eastern fence, interpreting them as transcendental aspirations. The language of this commentary involved allusions to divine women who represented these aspirations in early literature-the poet/shaman's love object and the goal of his impassioned quest. Though this equation of sex and transcendence slipped to the fringes of later literature, it became embedded in the pictorial tradition, offering a feminine form for the concept of divine aspirations and of immortality itself. The erotic object fixed in the seeker's mind is made manifest in the shape assumed by his person. The Buddhist analogies of Tao's silhouette functioned in much the same way. Tao may well have been entirely unaffected by contemporary Buddhism, as later writers have generally supposed; but the visual devices used to depict Buddhist donors and bodhisattvas provided familiar, strongly evocative formulas for representing minds fixed on otherworldly ideals, and Tao's image-makers had recourse to them. What, then, of the disjunction between these otherworldly, questing, feminine images and the written traditions of Tao Yuanming criticism with their emphasis on his rustic contentment and per- sonal integrity? The enormous privilege that written discourse and verbal texts have enjoyed in China over history is not in question, nor should we imag- ine that the illustrators of texts were any less sensible than everyone else to these cultural tropisms. But visual metaphors in Chinese art are not to be explained simply as pictorial versions of verbal dis- course, nor is there a corresponding written text for every pictorial invention. What we are accustomed to speaking of as textual illustration should rather be seen as a corpus of visual or pictorial commnentary on texts, with access to a vocabulary of meaningful forms of its own-forms that have to be parsed on 22</page><page sequence="23">TAO YUANMING S SASHES their own extratextual terms. When an idea-in this case, the idea of Tao's otherworldly preoccupa- tions-finds expression in a particularly powerful and dynamic visual formulation, it takes on its own kind of momentum and force. The metaphoric use of such forms circulates meanings through the image world, crisscrossing boundaries of subject matter and genre, importing and recharging concept, value, and affect. Tao Yuanming's sashes function meta- phorically in this way, inflecting his figure with ideas of flight, divinity, and desire and contributing dimensions to his historical image that cannot be explained within the compass of the written tradi- tion, broad as that compass may be.

There is no early evidence that Gu Kaizhi himself actually illustrated this text, though, and Chen Pao-chen believes, on the basis of compari- sons with datable narrative compositions at Dunhuang, that the extant versions are probably derived from a prototype of the sixth century.

The virtuous wife has sometimes served in Chinese litera- ture as a metaphor for the loyal official, whether appreciated or (like Qu Yuan) neglected, but I have not seen this metaphor used in reference to Tao Yuanming, nor have I found anything in the literature on Tao that seems to correspond to this visually proposed femininity. 38. Zhou Fang's painting is reproduced in color in Zhongguo meishu quanji: Huihua bian, 2:no. 23. 39. Guardian figures and other virile male divinities are com- monly shown with flying sashes too, but theirs tend to have a snapping, nooselike shape quite distinct from the smoother, svelte, undulating patterns of the goddesses'-and Tao Yuan- ming's. 40.

The painting is reproduced in color in pl. 16. Luo Ping's chrysanthemum- holding Yuan Mei tit uses the same masculine hand gesture (Vinograd, Boundaries, color pl. 12, printed in reverse). Eight- eenth-century scholars often had themselves painted standing and holding objects with which they wished to be identified. Popular choices were books, scrolls, writing brushes, and their own beards; a very few chose flowers. See Qu Guanqun and Hua Rende, eds., Zhongguo lidai mingren tujian, 2 vols.

(Hawkes, "Quest of the Goddess," 74, and Ch'u Tz'u, 39)-a gesture again at once amorous and vo- tive. Much of the flower and plant imagery that pervades the Nine Songs is associated with spiritual quest and union. And di- vinities may indeed respond to the lure of flowers; drawn by their fragrance, in the "Lady of the Xiang," "like clouds in num- ber the spirits come thronging." 45.
