<plain_text><page sequence="1">30 The organisation of votive production and distribution in the peak sanctuaries of state society Crete: a perspective offered by the Juktas clay animal figures Marika Zeimbeki The concern to determine the character of state soci- ety and statehood holds a central place in studies of Cretan polities of the Bronze Age (e.g. Cherry 1986; Warren 1987, 1994).1 Researchers have recently given momentum to their engagement with such issues by making use of ethnographic and archaeological models of statehood and by identifying, through innovative studies of material culture, the institutional character of economic, ritual and political organisation in Minoan society (e.g. Knappett on ceramic production 19970, 1997/*, 19990; Schoep 1999 on local and regional ad- ministration; Christakis 1999 on domestic food stor- age; Whitelaw et al. 1997 on local potting traditions and inter-regional economic contacts). Distancing themselves from centrist organisational models, stud- ies of local and regional material culture (and particu- larly those focusing on ceramics) have altered signifi- cantly our understanding of the organisational and in- stitutional settings relating to community-based eco- nomic activities. The study of the peak sanctuaries' material evidence could potentially benefit greatly from similar ap- proaches. These cult sites feature prominently in de- bates on the nature and form of political power in Minoan Crete; however their artefactual evidence has hardly been used as a source of information on how the symbolic and economic activities linking these cult sites with their surrounding communities were articu- lated materially and organisationally. Yet answers to such questions would throw light on how the economic, the ideological and the political spheres were interlinked in these central cult sites. Interest in the economic and organisational aspects of peak sanctuary ritual is timely in view of an increased emphasis on the contribution of the ideological sphere in explanations of the emer- gence of social and political complexity (Knappett 19990, 619-20, 635-6). THE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES OFFERED BY THE PEAK SANCTUARY MATERIAL EVIDENCE In this section I suggest how a problem oriented ap- proach to the material evidence from peak sanctuaries might help us to gain a further insight into these sites' organisational and institutional settings. Because of a traditional concern with the character of political power, attempts to identify peak sanctuar- ies' organisational settings have focused mainly on elaborate forms of material culture from more prestig- ious sanctuaries (e.g. stone offering tables and archi- tectural investment) with a view to ascertaining whether these cult sites were, or became, institutions of state centres (Rutkowski 1971, 1986; Cherry 1986; Peatfield 1987, 1990; Simandiraki 1998). In tandem with an in- creased concern with regional studies, this emphasis has recently been redressed by an interest in the mate- rial culture of peak sanctuaries situated in the rural milieu (Peatfield 1992). The contrastive, "qualitative" characterisation of peak sanctuaries' material culture and their organisa- tional settings into either "prestigious/palatial" or "humble" is beset with problems. It focuses selectively on the elite elements of more prestigious cult sites to the detriment of their other material features; and it characterises "rural" peak sanctuaries mainly in con- trast to more "prestigious" ones, rather than in terms of their specific material culture. A further repercus- 1 I should like to express my gratitude to Alexandra Karetsou, the excavator of the peak sanctuary on Mt Juktas, for support- ing me in my research and entrusting me with the publication of the animal figure assemblage from this fine sanctuary. This material was first studied for my doctoral thesis at the Univer- sity of Bristol. I am grateful to Peter Warren, who supervised my research, for his constant advice and guidance. I would like to thank both him and O. Dickinson for reading and dis- cussing this text, and P. Day, C. Knappett, K. Kopaka, A. Sarpaki, A. Simandiraki and T. Whitelaw for their comments on the paper and related matters. I should also like to thank Giannis Papadakis for the care he took in photographing the animal figurines. The animal figure assemblage from the Juktas peak sanctu- ary will be published by the Archaeological Society of Athens in a volume nearing completion, entitled The Juktas Peak Sanc- tuary: the Animal Figurines and Figures. The preparation of this volume for publication has been funded by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory.</page><page sequence="2">352 MARIKA ZEIMBEKI sion of this dualist approach is that it does not recog- nise adequately that a continuum of institutional and organisational settings might have existed between the extremes branded as elite and humble (for the wider permutations of this debate: Knappe« 19990, 635~9).2 Consequently, the potential organisational variability between and even within peak sanctuaries is not ad- equately recognised. The most serious shortcoming of this approach is that the contribution of the peak sanctuary institution itself is not utilised adequately in our understanding of the organisation of Minoan society. Peak sanctuary ritual brought about new forms of material and symbolic ex- change: the cult afforded a vehicle of collective expres- sion at a community and inter-community level; and it generated the widespread production of material cul- ture in response to an unprecedented social demand for ritual devices used by individual participants in col- lective worship. Most importantly, there is a tendency to ignore the common ground between peak sanctuar- ies, namely the fact that, institutionally, peak sanctuary organisation and, potentially, the production of its ma- terial culture were embedded in the social and economic life of its affiliated communities. It is therefore essen- tial to examine how the symbolic and economic activi- ties related to this cult were organised, and to gain an insight into the material articulation of links between community and peak sanctuary. I aim to contribute to these questions by examining the organisational and institutional setting of the MM I-LM I production and distribution of clay animal fig- ures at Juktas. It is believed that the study of this com- mon class of votive offering will have wider ramifica- tions in our understanding of peak sanctuary ritual. Depending on how the production and distribution of other objects at Juktas are found to have been organ- ised, the information derived from the animal figures can be used in either a comparative or contrastive ca- pacity. It can however be anticipated that some of the other clay votive offerings found at Juktas were made under the same or similar organisational conditions, very likely in the same workshops. I hope that the information derived from the Juktas setting, whose exceptional architectural and material investment has been ascribed to ritual and organisational connections with the Knossian palatial centre (Evans 1928,66,761, 1935, 607; Karetsou 1977,418, 1981, 151), may be usefully integrated into a wider analysis of peak sanctuary organisation because of its uniqueness, rather than despite it. THE DATA: THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROFILE AND PRODUCTION MODES OF THE JUKTAS ANIMAL FIGURES The Juktas evidence My aim in this section is to infer the modes of produc- tive organisation related to the clay animal figures de- posited at Juktas by identifying their technological pro- file. I establish this by assessing the degree of stand- ardisation, labour investment, and skill invested in the figures themselves. This approach is based on the work of Costin, Sinopoli and Hagstrum on specialisation (Costin 1 991; Costin and Hagstrum, 1995; Sinopoli 1988) and on its innovative application in Minoan ce- ramic studies by C. Knappett (19970, I997^&gt; 19990)- Once the productive modes are established, I assess how the ritual character of peak sanctuary activity and the links it generates between cult sites and communities could impact on the productive and distributive organi- sation of the votive animal figures. The animal figures deposited at Juktas from MM I to LM I are made in four principal fabrics.3 The ma- jority of these figures and fragments thereof (81%) are made in a pure, fine textured, hard fired fabric; 17% were manufactured from 3 rough textured fabrics; and the small remainder is made in other minority fabrics. Figurines in all fabrics are small, ranging from 1 .4 to 9.8 cm in length, with most between 2.2 and 2.8 cm; 2.9 to 34 cm is also common. However, the rough tex- tured fabrics have also been used to manufacture a far smaller proportion of medium and large figures, which make up less than 5% of the animal figure assemblage (intact figures/figurines and fragments thereof). These range between 18 and 27 cm in length. I use the terms "figurines" and "figures" to distinguish between these two clearly differentiated scales.4 The manufacture of the figurines, all solid and usu- ally solid painted, requires a relatively low level of in- vestment in time and labour. The diversity in form, scale and modelling of the figurines made with each of the three rough textured fabrics is indicative of low standardisation and low levels of skill. FIG. 30.1 shows rather extreme examples of this in one of these fabrics. At face value, the technological profile of the rough tex- tured figurines could be related to non - centralised production, that is, production by manufacturers work- ing independently of political/administrative authori- ties on a small scale in dispersed locations (Sinopoli 1988, 582). However, it is more likely that these rough textured figurines originated from a production group(s) which, when using this fabric, specialised mainly in the manufacture of clay vessels (maybe "utili- 2 This insight has been provided by the work of Knappett, who has demonstrated that such organisational and institutional variability exists in ceramics within both individual settlements and potting regions. 3 Pétrographie analysis, employed to verify the fabric distinc- tions made on the basis of macroscopic examination, will soon be under way. 4 See French 1985 for the importance of this distinction. The term "figures" is also used in this paper when general refer- ence is made to the entirety of animal figures and /or figurines deposited in a single site.</page><page sequence="3">THE ORGANISATION OF VOTIVE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 353 Fig. 30.1 (above).

This hypothesis may be indirectly reflected by several factors: the addi- tion of animal figurines on Juktas vessel rims made in the same rough textured fabrics (FIG. 30.2); the occa- sional production of rough textured figures (as opposed to figurines) in a scale akin to that of medium sized vessels; and the unsuitability of these fabrics for mod- elling in detail miniature or small scale figuration. Like the rough textured figurines, the far greater number of their counterparts in the fine fabric reflect low investment in both time and labour. In contrast however, their fabric permits a certain degree of delib- erate elaboration: they occasionally feature more indi- vidual forms of decoration (light on dark, and dark on light linear painted decoration); they have a greater range of forms (for example, naturalistic and schematic figurines can co-exist in the same contexts). They also represent a range of animal species fulfilling the sym- bolic requirements of the cult, in contrast to the rough textured figurines which mainly represent generic quad- rupeds. All the above aspects of the fine fabric figu- rines show that the frequent use of the fine fabric is due to its suitability in forming such small representa- tional devices. The fine fabric figurines are characterised by the consistent combination of fabric, forming technology and decoration. Their constant technological traits, in- cluding the dominant use of the pure, fine fabric, sup- port significantly the contention that many of the figu- rines dedicated at Juktas were the products of work- shop groups from the surrounding potting region, which includes Knossos and Archanes (for use of the term "technological trait" see Knappe« 19970, 3°9)- In morphological terms, they naturally manifest con- siderable diversity. This is partly but not exclusively due to the use of these votives over a wide chronologi- cal span, ranging from at least MM I to LM I. There are quite a few morphological singletons, and a low pro- portion of figurines evidences inconsistent and, at times, sloppy workmanship. But, in further contrast to the rough textured figurines, their fine fabric counterparts</page><page sequence="4">3 54 MARIKA ZEIMBEKI Fig jo. j. Morphologically similar figurines found in the same microstratigraphic context. show considerably high patterns of standardisation. Identical twos and threes are rare but it is possible to group together morphologically figurines numbering six, eight and even 1 1 (e.g. FIG. 30.3). Their clustering in the same microstratigraphic context indicates that these were produced in the same workshop, very likely during the same or closely spaced production events. Other larger morphological groups of figurines, found in a greater range of stratigraphie contexts, show that these were manufactured in a single or kindred work- shops, possibly attesting to a more durable manufac- turing tradition. A more difficult task than grouping together mor- phologically similar figurines is that of identifying the relationships between these groupings, in order to pin- point the number of workshops represented. Differ- ences between "sub-groups" of production units could be misinterpreted as differences between discrete pro- duction groups and vice versa (Knappett 1997^, 209- 1 1). This problem is further compounded by the fact that variability between groups could be attributed to either chronological differences or differences between workshops. Thus, for example, it remains unknown whether the rough textured figurines and figures were produced in the same or different workshops as the fine fabric figurines. Having said that, I feel that the identification of two large groups of closely similar figurines very likely at- tests to the co-existence from at least MM II to LM I of two distinct production units or groups providing the sanctuary with a considerable turnover of figurines, the sort of evidence we should expect to associate with more centralised independent production and a few dominant workshops (Sinopoli 1988, 581). The distinc- tion of the output of two production groups (number- ing at least 254, and 365 figurines) can be hypothesised because the forming procedures of each group features different sequences of physical actions and manipula- tion of clay, resulting in distinct and not overlapping morphological profiles. Such differences in motor habits could be indicative of different workshops (Knappett 1997^, 215 on pottery vessels; Morris 1993 on human figurines; more generally on differences between inten- tional and mechanical attributes see: Costin 1991, 35; Costin and Hagstrum 1995, 622). The figurines in question were found together in lay- ers dated to MM I-II, MM II-HI, and MM HI-LM I, but it is not possible to know how many workshop units were producing them (see Knappett 1997^ 209-10 for the distinction between workshop groups and workshop units). Group 1 figures are formed with the compress- ing (rather than stretching) of an initial piece of clay (FIGS. 30.4-30.5). The thumbs and fingers are manipu- lated in a consistent manner resulting in specific for- mal characteristics. These slightly squat figurines fre- quently feature a triangular, curved outline, with an obvious fall in the area of the rump. Subsequent form- ing is achieved with folding and tucking rather than pulling of the clay. In the group 2 figurines, more em- phasis is placed on pulling than pinching (FIGS. 30.6- 30.7). They are attenuated in form and their pointed legs and horns occasionally require the addition of clay. The production modes ofthejuktas animal figures The evidence permits us firmly to ascribe the produc- tion of the majority of clay animal votives offered at Juktas between MM I and LM I to specialist manufac- turers. The production by small manufacturing units with a low turnover should not be discounted in view of the considerable quantity of figures that are single- tons or cannot be neatly classified into larger group- ings. However the technological profile of the majority of figurines and figures shows that a production mode characterised by predominantly centralising tendencies was very likely in place from at least MM II to LM I.5 5 This production mode is commensurate with demand levels related to ritual participation during communal feast days.</page><page sequence="5">THE ORGANISATION OF VOTIVE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 355 Fig. 30.4 (above). Group 1 figurines, side view. Fig. 30.5 (below). Group 1 figurines, view from top. The projected variability of the productive modes of animal figures deposited at peak sanctuaries Because of the virtual absence of comparanda from other sites, we cannot show how typical or not the centralised productive mode was; however it should not be taken as the norm for all peak sanctuaries. It is also evidenced in the animal figures from the prestigious peak sanctu- ary of Kofinas (see below). The only other site from which the systematic study of the evidence affords a potential insight into the productive systems of human (not animal) figures is from the Atsipades peak sanctu- ary. In her stylistic analysis of this assemblage, C. Mor- ris groups together these figurines on the basis of pri- marily morphological features and provides valuable information on the range and frequency of figurine types and their contexts of deposition (Morris 1993). In comparison with the Juktas animal figure assemblage, the Atsipades human figurines exhibit greater variabil- ity with fewer numbers of figurines in each grouping. While groups of twos and threes are common (Morris X993&gt; 58-66), they are rarer at Juktas where groupings of animal figurines have more members. The large groups amounting to hundreds do not seem to be at- tested at Atsipades. These differences may indicate that, in contrast to Juktas, the Atsipades votive material was mainly produced in smaller scale workshops with lower turnovers (Costin and Hagstrum 1995, 624; Sinopoli 1988, 582), a profile characteristic of non-centralised production. We should not expect the productive modes repre- sented by Atsipades on the one hand and Kofinas and especially Juktas on the other (sites used to exemplify the contrast between "rural" and more "sophisticated" sanctuaries) to comprise the only manifestations of the productive organisation of animal figures dedicated at</page><page sequence="6">356 MARIKA ZEIMBEKI Fig. 30.6 (above).

They could have ranged within a continuum from non-centralised to centralised mode (Costin 1991, 33) THE ORGANISATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTER OF ANIMAL FIGURE PRODUCTION In this section I consider how the use of animal figures in the public ritual sphere, the articulation of the mate- rial links between communities and cult sites, and the organisational character and socio-political settings of peak sanctuaries could affect the institutional and or- ganisational character of the production and distribu- tion of these figures. I try to account for the organisa- tional variability attested by the different productive modes and, more specifically, to assess how centralis- ing tendencies in the production of animal figures might be viewed within the organisational context of the Juktas sanctuary, evidencing as it does the intervention of an elite priesthood. The production context of the animal figures In theory we can envisage a range of organisational sys- tems of production and distribution for the votive ani- mal figures dedicated at peak sanctuaries. Each corre- sponds with different sources and forms of organisa- tional initiative, producer relations, and material rela- tions between communities and peak sanctuaries. One such scenario is the production of clay votive animals in installations either within or close to the sanctuary, exclusively serving the productive requirements of the cult. Should animal figure production have occurred in such a context, we might expect to find waste mate- rial or debris related to manufacture6 but not necessar- ily a complex manufacturing installation since the fig- 6 For an example of the remains of evidence of Aztec figurine manufacture but no kiln production, see Charlton et al. 1991, 106.</page><page sequence="7">THE ORGANISATION OF VOTIVE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 357 ures could be fired in an open space rather than a built kiln.7 While on-site production of animal figures may even- tually be shown to have taken place in other peak sanc- tuaries, its occurrence in Juktas cannot be positively attested. I therefore proceed, by default, on the prem- iss that the figures dedicated at Juktas (and some other peak sanctuaries) were made in workshops not exclu- sively serving the ritual needs of sanctuaries. This sec- ond scenario would have entailed different organisa- tional logistics since it would have involved the move- ment of votives (as well as worshippers) to the peak sanctuary and since makers would not have been affili- ated to central ritual places subject to regulation by re- ligious authorities. The economic scale of production Now that we have decided upon the extra-sanctuary productive context of the Juktas figures, we might be in a better position to situate certain aspects of the eco- nomics of their production, i.e. the scale of both de- mand and productive output, within their wider eco- nomic setting. The turnover of the community-based workshop groups manufacturing the Juktas animal figures is com- patible with the levels and forms of demand generated by the urban settlements in the sanctuary's catchment area. For example, large-scale workshops accommodat- ing a centralised productive system and servicing the urban centres of Knossos and Archanes may well have existed alongside smaller scale workshops with a smaller turnover. It is also to be expected that figures dedicated in peak sanctuaries with catchment areas encompass- ing smaller scale, rural communities might represent the output of a less centralised, even non-centralised, productive mode commensurate with the lower levels of demand and the productive scale of organisation gen- erated by these settlements. This hypothesis is not con- tradicted by the preliminary information derived from the Atsipades human figurines, provided their produc- tion was carried out in an extra-sanctuary context. These correlations between scale of demand, scale of productive modes and their wider socio-economic set- tings are commensurate with those projected by Knappett for community based production of utilitar- ian wares (Knappett 1997a, 309-1 1).8 This is not sur- prising since both utilitarian and ritual objects may have been produced by the same workshop groups and thus be subject to the same production conditions. However it remains to be seen whether the production and dis- tribution of the animal figures were subject to the same source and form of organisational regulation as the utili- tarian wares produced in the same productive mode. Potential sources of organisational regulation of the animal figures' production and distribution systems. According to models defining the character of produc- tion systems manufacturing utilitarian wares for com- munity use, both centralised and non-centralised (and presumably intermediary) forms of production organi- sation are institutionally and organisationally independ- ent of political/religious authorities (Sinopoli 1988, 581; Costin and Hagstrum 1995, 620). However, one must ask whether the production/distribution of ritual ob- jects like votives might be subject to regulation of this sort. Such a caveat is recognised by Sinopoli. She con- tends that regulation might occur if goods manufac- tured with a centralised production mode are used in a sphere of consumption that provides an institutional setting for the elite display of ideological power and the consolidation of its political power (Sinopoli 1988, 581). Therefore such objects could be subject to a form of intervention akin to (if not identical with) that related to administered production. In this respect, it is worth mentioning Knappett's suggestion that the Malia elite may have been involved in the provision of plain drink- ing vessels for public feasting from as early as the Protopalatial period (Knappett 19970, 3°9&gt; I997^&gt; 2i3~ 14 where the term "partially administered" productive mode is used). It is imperative therefore to consider whether the production and distribution of the animal figures was linked to some form of higher intervention by religious/political authorities, possibly emanating from the institution of the peak sanctuary itself. Evidence of regulatory intervention is already known to us from the peak sanctuary's ritual context. A. Karetsou has identified the unique architectural invest- ment at Juktas (Karetsou 1976, 408-14, 1978, 232-46, 1979,281, 1980,344-51,1981, 141, 147-51). This shows that, even prior to MM III-LM I, the ritual and mate- rial organisation of this cult site was regulated by the elite and grounded in the political economy of, very likely, the Knossian palatial centre (Karetsou 1977, 418, 1 98 1, 151). This architectural articulation of physical space offers a good indication that religious authorities officiated over ceremonies enacted at the site. Juktas is unique among peak sanctuaries in that its architecture projects forcefully the religious and political authority emanating from the cult site itself. However, another physical manifestation of involve- ment by the religious/political authorities in peak sanc- tuaries is not restricted to Juktas. The MM III-LM I stone offering tables dedicated at several prestigious 7 Evidence for such simple but effective installations for firing large animal figures can be found in the village of Lambadia, north Gujarat. They are circular depressions in the ground that have been used for generations. The figures are covered by a mound of twigs and cowdung cakes: Shah 1985, 41, 52-3. 8 1 hese patterns emerge from Knappett's study of ceramic pro- duction in the Protopalatial Malia "state". He has shown that the centralised production mode is evidenced by utilitarian wares in the town of Malia, whereas the smaller community of Myrtos-Pyrgos evidences a non-centralised production mode.</page><page sequence="8">358 MARIKA ZEIMBEKI peak sanctuaries, which bear the physical characteris- tics of products made by an administered productive system, were most likely manufactured by specialists attached to (low-lying?) elite institutions with which the priesthood was linked.9 In the absence of reported evidence of sanctuary- based production of stone offering tables, their manu- facture in habitations sites cannot be excluded. In the case of Kato Symi, which is not a peak sanctuary, the excavator reports that there is clear proof that the stone offering tables were manufactured at the cult site itself (Lebessi 2000, 175). A factor contributing to this pro- ductive context might be the physical distance of Symi from the urban centre of origin of the priesthood offi- ciating at it. Most of the physically identifiable evidence of priestly involvement in the material means of produc- tion relates to the administered production system (be it the Juktas architecture or the stone offering tables), and is restricted to more prestigious sanctuaries. How- ever we still need to determine who organised the pro- duction/distribution of ritual objects used widely by community participants, and dedicated at all peak sanc- tuaries. They are undoubtedly related to a different sphere of production and consumption from the offer- ings bearing the characteristics of administered pro- duction. It has been suggested above, at least in rela- tion to the rough textured figurines and figures, that they were made in workshops which also supplied sur- rounding settlements with ceramic wares used in both ritual and (mainly?) utilitarian contexts, and this very likely also applies to the fine fabric figurines. However the question must still be asked whether their produc- tion/distribution was the prerogative of independent producers, or whether this aspect of the material cul- ture may offer an otherwise elusive insight into the in- volvement by local religious authorities in the organi- sation of these public, extra-community sanctuaries. The material articulation of links between community and peak sanctuary To resolve this matter, it is necessary to reconstruct in greater detail the material articulation of the links be- tween peak sanctuary and community evidenced by these votive offerings. Ideally, we need to know the provenance(s) of the worshippers visiting Juktas; the provenance(s) of the votives, pottery and other ritual paraphernalia deposited there; where the worshippers acquired the figures, at the sanctuary itself or in their community/ies; and whether or not the distribution pattern of dedicators and votives coincides. One must ask whether there is an organisational link between the predominantly centralised production sys- tem of the Juktas animal figures and the (at least in some respects) centralised elite organisation of the sanctu- ary. It is however difficult to comprehend the potential organisational links between the economic and ritual spheres because of the problems in reconstructing the spatial and logistical dimensions of the figures' pro- duction and distribution systems. Even the task of identifying how many (not even which) topographic locations they were made in seems problematic. The figures have been interpreted as the products of two production units or groups manufac- turing on a large scale and very likely several smaller ones with a lower turnover. Because of the predomi- nance of the fine fabric, the spatial provenance of the figures cannot be distinguished on the basis of fabric differentiation. Furthermore, because of the additional similarity in firing conditions and formal attributes like their mean length, it is virtually impossible to know whether the smaller production units were located in the same or different areas from the larger ones and also whether the two large workshop units/groups were associated with provisioning of the same or different communities. So it remains unknown whether the cen- tralised production system was responding to local (ur- ban?) community requirements or also meeting the de- mands of neighbouring communities. It has already been suggested that significant degrees of centralisation in the votive productive system could be indicative of the region's economic scale of activi- ties. Even if such a system could be shown to evidence the spatial centralisation of votive production, this does not constitute proof that it was subject to the central- ised regulation of a priestly authority. It is possible that one or two independent workshops producing utilitar- ian wares might have had a specialist tradition in mak- ing representational votives and other ritual objects. By the same token, an independent workshop could be sup- plying more than one community with utilitarian and ritual wares, particularly if it is situated at some dis- tance from its surrounding habitation sites. Pertinent here is Karetsou's suggestion that one of the workshops providing Juktas worshippers with pottery may be lo- cated at the foot of Juktas between Vathypetro and Archanes (Karetsou 1976, 415, 1978, 253-4).10 The one logistical requirement that might have ne- cessitated an overarching organisational input extend- ing beyond the producers' remit may be related to the post-production stage of the proceedings. If the cult sites functioned as central locations not only for the dedication but also for the acquisition of the figures, cult organisers could have forged loose organisational rela- tions with the figures' makers through mediating in their relationship with the dedicators. It is conceivable that such a conjectured relationship between produc- ers and cult officials might have been more formal if a few, or even one, workshop unit produced the prepon- derance of votives used in the peak sanctuary. The ac- 9 For the stone offering tables found at Juktas, see Karetsou 1 974, 236, 1976, 415, 1977, 419-20, 1978, 257-8, 1980, 347-8, 1984, 1 13-14, 1985, 86-7, 1988, 162-3; Karetsou et al. 1985. 10 Karetsou considers that this workshop produced ceramics found at Juktas, Archanes and the "villa" at Vathypetro.</page><page sequence="9">THE ORGANISATION OF VOTIVE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 359 quisition of figures at the peak sanctuary would have made logistical sense if the workshop was located at some distance from the habitation sites of the worship- pers, or if a workshop(s) were supplying worshippers from several communities. However, it would be incor- rect to ascribe this hypothetical function of the cult site as an acquisition centre of votives only in the case of more centralised production systems. This post-production involvement would comply with the form of intervention by religious/political authorities envisaged by Sinopoli (1988, 581).11 Unfor- tunately it remains a hypothesis, since the figures them- selves cannot serve as indices of whether they were ac- quired at the cult site or in the workshop. The deposi- tion of similar figures in a microstratigraphic context could indicate that dedicators from the same locality visited the sanctuary together bringing their figures with them (Shah 1985, 26-7). While a more in-depth study of the ethnographic data is necessary, these seem to show that the production of clay votives occurred commonly in communities rather than sanctuaries located close to settlements, and that these votives could have been ac- quired either at the sanctuary or the workshop.12 If it could be shown that the figures were acquired by the worshippers in their communities, we should expect that they were made independently by producers, irre- spective of the degree of centralisation of the produc- tive system. Conclusions Although the animal figures were used in a public ritual context, their physical setting of production in work- shops that were very likely manufacturing utilitarian wares suggests that they were manufactured by inde- pendent producers. It is surely significant that this is the case with the figures dedicated at Juktas, a site evi- dencing in other respects a considerable degree of cen- tralised ritual organisation. The specialised production modes of animal figures will probably be shown to vary from site to site and will need to be considered within the socio-political setting of each sanctuary's catchment area. We must evaluate each sanctuary's material evidence separately. In order to gain a comprehensive under- standing of how the economic, ritual and political spheres were related in these cult sites we need to lo- cate topographically the workshops and the provenance of both worshippers and cult officiants. This will en- able us to qualify with greater confidence the charac- terisation of peak sanctuaries as "community" or "in- ter-community" shrines. One must stress that this analysis is based on evi- dence from one site, and that we must be prepared to recognise in future different patterns of evidence from those discussed above. Variability seems to be the key to understanding the productive modes of animal fig- ures, but without enough comparanda we cannot yet use it to its full interpretational potential. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUKTAS FIGURES' PRODUCTIVE TRADITION I should like to end by comparing the Kofinas and Juktas animal figure assemblages, with a view to defining bet- ter the specific temporal and cultural circumstances surrounding the local production tradition evidenced by the Juktas figuration. This comparison shows that the organisational and institutional setting of the fig- ures' manufacture/distribution can enhance our under- standing of the local form of their production and con- sumption. The presence of many figurines at Juktas is inversely linked with the low presence of figures, while the re- verse applies to Kofinas where the animal figures domi- nate.13 Commensurate with the prominence of differ- ently sized figurational devices at each site is the domi- nance of different manufacturing techniques. The solid figurines are simply made whereas figures combining hollow and solid parts require a specialised and more elaborate formation process. The hollow portions of the Kofinas figures, formed with slab building, provide evidence of rolling, patting and possibly further draw- ing of the clay after the initial slab was formed.14 Although the Juktas and Kofinas animal figure as- semblages manifest considerable differences in the de- grees of skill and labour investment, they were both the products of a manufacturing mode with centralis- ing tendencies.15 While a detailed technological profile has not yet been established for the Kofinas assemblage, a non-centralised productive mode seems unlikely: the 11 In the case of centralised productive systems, Sinopoli envis- ages the "political elite intervening primarily at the final stages of the production-distribution process" (Sinopoli 1988, 581). 12 The inhabitants of Mitla in Mexico buy and sell miniature replicas of what they desire (fields, animals, houses) when they gather at the cult site at which they celebrate their communal ritual (Wolf 1966, 99 and n. 2). In contrast, at Chhota Udaipur in central Gujarat the dedicators acquire the animal votives and carry them off to the open air sanctuary (Shah 1985, 85). I hope to look more systematically, for comparative purposes, at the archaeological and ethnographic literature relating to the production/distribution of clay votives dedicated at both com- munity shrines located close to settlements and urban tem- ples. 13 The sheer quantity of large figures found at Kofinas trans- forms our understanding of Minoan animal figuration. 14 These figures are hand built. Neither wheel throwing nor com- bination methods like coiling and wheel throwing or wheel shaping (Knappett 1999^) have been attested so far in the study of the assemblage. 15 Note that while some categories of votives like faience beads and votive stone plaques were produced within temple com- pounds of New Kingdom Hathor temples, the clay fertility figures were very likely produced in community workshops, with the implication that they were brought to the cult site by the dedicator (Pinch 1993, 329-30, has an useful review of ethnographic material, especially Indian, on the production and distribution of votives).</page><page sequence="10">3Ó0 MARIKA ZEIMBEKI manifestly high levels of skill and the considerable in- vestment in expertise and labour time show that the figures were produced in a centralised manner. They are also different from the MM IH-LM I mould made figures bearing the characteristics of administered pro- duction, used primarily in low lying contexts of ritual use. Peak sanctuaries rarely feature the MM III-LMI mould made figures produced in administered contexts. This reinforces the point that in MM IH-LM I several spheres of production and consumption existed for animal figures, and that these very rarely intersected. This is corroborated by the sparse occurrence at Juktas and Kofinas of hollow, hand formed figures emulating mould made ones. The distinct formal attributes of each site's figures can best be explained in terms of the temporally and spatially determined social circumstances surrounding local traditions of production and consumption. The production of small (in fact miniature) figurines dedi- cated at Juktas from MM I to LM I is the hallmark of a local manufacturing tradition in figurational represen- tation. Its tenacity is evidenced by the low presence of large figures that were increasingly made across Crete during MM IH-LM I (Kourou and Karetsou 1997, 1 13). This conservatism can be ascribed to the fact that figurines served well the site's ritual and ideological re- quirements. The Kofinas material, with its shorter and (significantly) later chronological span in MM IH-LM I, shows that the widespread adoption of innovative forming techniques in producing figures is more likely to be embraced, even initiated, within the context of a recently established cult site and its attendant ritual and social requirements. The formal similarity of the zoomorphs within each site served to reinforce the group identity of ritual par- ticipants. However, the formal differences of contem- porary (MM IH-LM I) figures between these two sites show that in each sanctuary animal figuration embod- ies different social values relating to the display poten- tial of the figures and the projection of the group's so- cial/ritual status. The small, inconspicuous Juktas figu- rines projected egalitarian access to ritual by retaining a form established in MM I- II while the more con- spicuous Kofinas figures, reflecting a contemporary concern for social display, perhaps attested to inegalitarian access due to the social and/or ritual iden- tity of the cult participants. The local Juktas and Kofinas traditions evidence an adherence to an "optimal mode of production" (Costin 1 99 1, 13) determined by specific sets of social and ritual requirements. However by establishing the physical at- tributes of figuration, these productive traditions are instrumental in dictating how the local dedicator is materially projected in the group ritual. It remains to be seen to what degree this formal consistency, and the way it impacts on the individual's choice of votive of- fering, manifests itself in less centralised forms of pro- duction organisation. Had we not used the technological profile of the Juktas figures as an independent source of evidence re- garding their production mode, we might have made incorrect assumptions about the character of the or- ganisational/institutional setting of their production organisation by relying on their obvious physical at- tributes. Thus, by simply contrasting the formal char- acteristics of the Juktas and Kofinas figures, we might have incorrectly characterised their respective produc- tion modes (e.g. as non-centralised and centralised; or centralised and administered), not realising that both sets of figures were the products of similar production modes. Similarly, by simply contrasting "qualitatively" the figures as "humble" and "sophisticated", the relative rarity of figures and the prominence of figurines at Juktas, the most prestigious sanctuary of its kind, would have seemed perplexing. Yet by situating historically and chronologically both sites' local production tradi- tions and the social values they projected, we are pre- vented from making contrasts of this order. The term "crude" is often employed with pejorative connotations in the literature to describe figurines very like those deposited at Juktas. This misguided term far from re- flects the specialised productive systems that have given them form.16 Finally, it becomes clear that the physical location and institutional context of the production and acqui- sition of symbolic devices like the animal figures are essential in understanding the setting within which the formation of ideologies and the display of social norms were projected through the peak sanctuary ritual. The challenge which lies ahead is the explanation of the meaning and diversity of these ideologies. 1 6 The opinion has been voiced by archaeologists themselves that simply made clay figures characterised as "crude" cannot be the work of specialists. This for example is implied in Lesure 1999, 210-11. "Random" samples of the use of the term for clay animal and human votives can be found in Postgate (1994, 176: Mesopotamia), and Pinch (1993, 329-30: Egypt), who suggests that crude figures may have been made by poor dedi- cators or unskilled craftsmen.
