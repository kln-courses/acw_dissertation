<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A Need for Greater Openness:  The Countryside in Czech Fiction  since 1989 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS In The Country and the City, Raymond Williams rides a metaphorical  escalator back through English literary history, noting how writers  repeatedly return from ‘the city’ to ‘the country’ to lament the destruction  of a better, more ‘organic’ way of life. The conception of ‘the country’ is not  identical in each case:  What seemed a single escalator, a perpetual recession into history, turns  out, on reflection, to be a more complicated movement: Old England,  settlement, the rural virtues — all these, in fact, mean different things at  different times, and quite different values are being brought into question.  We shall need precise analysis of each kind of retrospect, as it comes.1 The persistence of these returns, however, in all urbanized literatures,  seems to Williams to reflect ‘some permanent or effectively permanent  need, to which the changing interpretations speak’.2 Most basically, ‘the  country’ represents for human beings their origins, an ‘other’ against  which their present state may be measured, both positively and negatively: Rajendra A. Chitnis is a Senior Lecturer in Czech and Russian Studies at the University  of Bristol. 1  R. Williams, The Country and the City, Oxford and New York, 1973, p. 12. 2  Ibid., p. 289. In his discussion of the ‘regional novel’, which includes both rural and  urban writing, Keith Snell also rejects the notion of decline in favour of cyclicality. He  notes that regional-novel publishing emerges most strongly ‘during periods when older  interior ways of life were being threatened economically, and when changes in familiar and  psychological “landscapes” affected even those who were economically secure, who were  the majority readership’.

CHITNIS On the country has gathered the idea of a natural way of life: of peace,  innocence, and simple virtue. On the city has gathered the idea of an  achieved centre of learning, communication, light. Powerful hostile  associations have also developed: on the city as a place of noise, worldliness  and ambition; on the country as a place of backwardness, ignorance,  limitation.3 ‘The country’ may serve as a measure not only of humanity’s decline  from the ideal, but also of its progress from the primitive. It may not only  be advocated, but also tested or mocked as a better way of life, a place  of potential escape or source of redemption for ‘the city’. A definition of  rural writing must therefore include any text for which analysis of the  representation of ‘the country’, as a setting, concept or metaphor, produces  a complete interpretation. ‘Returns to the Rural’ in Czech Literature Williams’s notion of cyclical ‘returns to the rural’ is exemplified in the  history of Czech literature since at least the early-nineteenth-century  National Revival. These returns have generally reflected a desire to retreat  from excessive openness to alien influences to the strong, comforting  embrace of national tradition. In the 1880s, patriotic intellectuals criticized  Czech writers for threatening the nation’s very existence by abandoning  the native literary tradition for superficial imitations of fashionable  foreign literature.4 The 1930s Ruralists responded similarly to the left-wing  avant-garde.5 In the 1950s, in imitation of the concurrent collectivization  of agriculture, Czech Stalinist writers seized ‘the country’ from the  predominantly Roman Catholic rural right and enclosed it within Socialist  Realism, while during the 1970s Normalization, conformist writers set the  ‘normality’ of the collectivized countryside against the ‘abnormality’ of the  ‘Western-inspired’ ‘reform-Communism’ of the 1968 Prague Spring.6  3  Williams, The Country and the City, p. 291. 4  For a discussion of rural fiction in this period, see R.

Kvapil, Venkov v současné české  literatuře, Prague, 1944. 6  Pavel Janoušek argues that, during the Normalization, the rural setting represented  for some ‘the opportunity to argue that at least in the village, unlike in towns and factories,  something visibly new and different and relatively functioning had been created, that is,  something like real Socialism’.

The grandmother, a pious, humble, intuitively  patriotic woman who passes on to her grandchildren the model of a  self-sacrificing life lived in harmony with Nature and folk wisdom, was  presented as a national ideal to which Czechs should return for succour and  inspiration, though Babička is itself better understood as part of another  instance of Williams’s ‘rural retrospect’ in Czech literary history. From  the 1890s onwards, rural writers repeatedly try to re-imagine the ideal,  closed, rural national space in notionally epic, increasingly anachronistic  texts that endeavour to reverse the perceived speed and fragmentation  of modern urban literature and life, typified by the monumental novel  cycle Naši (Our Folk, 1897–1930) by Josef Holeček (1853–1929). Each time,  however, the ‘return to the rural’ is overwhelmed by anxiety. Most writers  find the rural ideal only in an unrecoverable past, and view ‘the city’ —  progress, education, economic power — as either the unstoppable cause of  the devastation of ‘the country’ and human beings, or the only source of  their recovery. The Twenty-First-Century Czech ‘Return to the Rural’ The present study is devoted to a ‘precise analysis’ of the ‘return to the rural’  in early-twenty-first-century Czech fiction, which — as a phenomenon —  has gone largely unrecognized by Czech critics, despite producing many of  the most admired books of the decade. As in the late nineteenth century,  this ‘return to the rural’ has no single ideological basis, but signals a shift  in the preoccupations of Czech literature or the terms in which it explores  them. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the countryside had all but  disappeared from Czech fiction. A comprehensive survey of 1990s Czech  literature makes no mention of it.7 Then, in 2001, ‘the country’ suddenly  returned in four of the most widely discussed books of the year — by Květa  Legátová (b.1919), Jáchym Topol (b.1962), Miloš Urban (b.1967) and Ludvík  Vaculík (b.1926) — and the trend continued in the following years.  The authors involved form a panorama of contemporary Czech  literature, from those born early in the First Republic (Legátová, Vaculík)  to those with no adult memory of the Communist period (Petra Hůlová,  b.1979). It includes writers associated with sanctioned fiction (Antonín  Bajaja, b.1942), dissidence (Vaculík) and the underground (Topol) under  7  See L. Machala, Literární bludiště, Prague, 2001.  </page> <page sequence="4"> 434 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS Communism, and writers who emerged only after 1989 — Urban, Radka  Denemarková (b.1968), Jiří Hájíček (b.1967) — writers long interested  in rural themes (Bajaja, Legátová, Vaculík) and writers who have either  moved decisively from ‘the city’ to ‘the country’ (Topol) or oscillate  between them (Hůlová). Their work, however, seems commonly motivated  by a desire to disturb the prevailing, illusorily comfortable stagnation of  ‘the city, connected perhaps with post-Communist society’s perceived  failure to break with the myths, attitudes and behaviour of the preceding  decades. Unlike their predecessors, 2000s rural writers therefore return  to ‘the country’ seeking not security and stability, but greater ‘openness’,  understood variously as intellectual curiosity, adaptability, empathy,  direct contact with Nature, the willingness to revisit prevailing accounts  of twentieth-century Czech history or the desire to escape national  introversion for the debates of the wider world.   Denemarková and Hájíček present ‘the city’ as a source of enlightenment  and progress. For the others, however, it is a place of homogenized, passive,  complacent space of consumerism, convenience, superficial sophistication  and illusory security, synonymous with the pro-Western, pro-business,  ‘global’ liberal consensus that dominated the post-Communist Czech  political establishment, media and public life. ‘The country’, by contrast,  is forgotten, a place one visits for recreation rather than lives and works.  Writers dramatize the rediscovery of ‘the country’ by showing characters  move from ‘the city’ to ‘the country’, or by ‘moving’ the reader to the  countryside, sometimes back in time or abroad, where ‘the country’ exists  in a way it no longer does in the Czech Republic. Topol, a ‘mystic of Prague’,  was widely considered in his third novel, Noční práce (Night Work, 2001),  to have moved himself from the city to the countryside.8  ‘The country’ in Czech rural fiction has historically been synonymous  with the village. Unlike their late-nineteenth-century counterparts,  however, the 2000s writers do not need to dispel urban illusions about  idyllic village life, which exists only as an extension of the urban or a  festering relic. As Ondřej Horák notes, novelists, like historians, merely  investigate the causes of its fate:  What is the situation in the Czech village and why? Was its structure —  especially on the edges of the republic — destroyed as early as 1938, when  it became important who was German, Czech or Jewish? Or is today’s  8  L.

Did  November 1989 provide a new impulse for the village, or was it the last nail  in the coffin when people began to move to towns for work?9  Since the cultural liberalization of the 1960s, writers like Vaculík, in his  1966 novel Sekyra (translated as The Axe), have blamed the destruction of  the village way of life, and the contemporary Czech’s definitive separation  from the countryside, on the post-war collectivization of agriculture.10  In an interview published in March 1989, Vaculík’s fellow east Moravian,  Bajaja, a cattle breeder since 1964, described the change: When I started, cooperatives were not yet being merged. Where there  had been a village, you had a collective farm. And in some villages there  were more private farmers than cooperative farmers. Family, neighbourly  relations dominated among ordinary people. There were still farmers  working in the cooperatives who had put their property into them. Today  it is their children, grandchildren, relatives or completely different people,  who have come just to make a good living.11 In his view, ‘cooperatives are now agricultural-industrial cooperatives. The  basic rights of cooperative workers are the same as in industry. Alienation  from the soil and from animals is growing everywhere’.12 This alienation  pervades Bajaja’s bold 1988 novel, Duely (Duels), which echoes the then  unavailable Sekyra in its portrayal of villages as homogenized, anonymous  dormitories, where understanding between generations has broken down.13  Vaculík’s Cesta na Praděd (Journey to Praděd, 2001) is based on a  journey that he made in August 1966, as a Prague-based journalist, on  horseback and by horse and cart from central Bohemia to north Moravia’s  9  O. Horák, ‘Posílám nějaké peníze, s úctou Hitler’, Lidové noviny, 28 June 2006, p. 20. 10  In its content and timing, this ‘analysis’ coincides with the criticism in identical  terms of EEC agricultural policy by the emerging ecological movement in the West,  exemplified by E. F. Schumacher’s Small is Beautiful (1973, Czech translation, 2000). The  publication of the first major post-Communist historical account of the collectivization  coincided with the beginning of the 2000s ‘return to the rural’ (see K. Jech, Soumrak  selského stavu, 1945–60, Prague, 2001). 11  P. Frýbort, O.

Indeed, because it was this generation which caused the rupture, the generation which, in  building better tomorrows, forgot not only their forebears, but also those for whom they  wanted to build them’.

The text was more than half written in 1966, but not  completed until 2001. The narrator says of the villages he sees: Neither village, nor town. Neither past, nor future. A loss of memory. The  desertion and denial of true origins. The villages in this poor region beside  the River Sázava still take their living from the fields, but in 1966 without  great confidence in them [...]. Everywhere it is the same and I see it  everywhere. I have visited so many such places that they merge for me into  one horrendously typical place, a place seen in high fevers or bad dreams.  The main village buildings always laid out identically and the same for  all the walls, so that to climb over the wall means to find yourself where  you were before. It makes no difference whether you speak to no one or  everyone. A total loss of long-term memory. They don’t know where they  have come from, and I don’t know where I am.14 This homogenization eradicates the natural diversity given by each  village’s name, the shape of its fields, its trees, the speed of the water in its  stream, the views from its windows and doorways: ‘The Bohemian village  as an artistic living-space, which said something to poets and composers,  must be considered a thing of the past.’15  For the 2000s Czech rural writers, the traditional idea of the village  either no longer exists or repels them as a symbol of ideological propaganda.  They are therefore liberated to explore the alternative connotations and  uses of ‘the country’ in early-twenty-first-century literature. The close  reading in this study begins with Denemarková and Hájíček, for whom  the decay of the village leaves only ‘the city’. I then turn to writers who  choose instead to look beyond the contemporary ruined village for a more  powerful idea of ‘the country’, located in either the open countryside or the  countryside of the past. I end with discussion of two Hůlová novels that  serve as commentaries on ‘the return to the rural’. Opening the Past From Hájíček’s Selský baroko (Peasant Baroque, 2005) to Denemarková’s  Peníze od Hitlera (Money from Hitler, 2006) to Topol’s Noční práce and  Kloktat dehet (2005, translated into English as Gargling with Tar), the village  serves as an increasingly explicit metaphor for a society that stubbornly  rejects openness and enlightenment in favour of reassuring prejudices and  14  L.

Selský baroko still echoes Vaculík’s regretful portrayal of the village  as a victim of external forces. The novel is set in the author’s home region  of South Bohemia, paradigmatically idealized by Holeček as the cradle  of Czech nationhood, but here beset by unemployment, under-education  and alcoholism. Hájíček unequivocally condemns collectivization for  devastating agriculture and a once admirable rural way of life, notably in  a passage in which the history of the embedding into Czech of the word  ‘kulak’ (the Stalinist Russian label for a land-owning farmer) is implicitly  shown to parallel the twentieth-century decline of rural and public life.16  This decline is encapsulated in the account of a pub that only opens when  the landlord gets home from his job in town.   Hájíček’s villagers are, however, prejudiced and devious. They mistrust  and mock the narrator, Pavel, an archivist and local historian, because  of his university education and non-manual profession, and drive away  his well-meaning, city-born wife. The ‘baroque’ political machinations  that Pavel uncovers are unchanged between the collectivization and the  early twenty-first century. Short of money, Pavel accepts a mysterious  commission to establish why, in the early 1950s, three wealthy farmers  were imprisoned and lost their land. He discovers that one had made a  peasant woman pregnant, but denied paternity. In revenge, she wrote to  the police, informing them of the farmers’ illegal gambling, and the police  seized the opportunity to present their meetings as a plot. In 2004, the  woman’s illegitimate son is standing for mayor, and his opponents want  the information to discredit him. When Pavel refuses to give it to them, it  is stolen by Daniela, a woman in their pay, who seduces him.17  Daniela embodies the ambiguity of the rural in the novel. She reminds  Pavel of his ex-wife, except for an indefinable difference, explained when  she turns out to be the grand-daughter of one of the farmers, who is fighting  to have his land returned. Unlike Pavel’s less tenacious wife, Daniela comes  from tough, pre-collectivization farming stock, and has not given up, but  will do anything to achieve her aim. Hájíček wants to find hope in the  rural, but cannot. His difficulty is encapsulated in Pavel’s inability to  reconcile the unreliable historical memory of local people and the rational  precision of his laptop memory.18 Unable to find Daniela’s spirit among  16  See J. Hájíček, Selský baroko, Prague, 2005, pp. 21–23. 17  Janoušek argues that Daniela could not have deceived Pavel because he would  have begun researching her genealogy through the paternal line. See Janoušek, ‘Co s tou  kolektivizací?’, p. 77. 18  Hájíček’s approach superficially recalls Graham Swift’s Waterland (1983, in Czech  1993), in which the purpose of historiography is explored in the context of painful personal  </page> <page sequence="8"> 438 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS the rural ‘lumpenproletariat’ produced by industrialized agriculture,  Hájíček reluctantly concludes that the task of reviving the countryside and  preserving what remains of the traditional ‘peasant baroque’ architecture  is better left to rich ‘in-comers’ from ‘the city’ with the know-how and  respect.  Hájíček’s ambivalence stems from his identification with Pavel, who  is torn between the rural and urban. In Peníze od Hitlera, by contrast,  Denemarková’s initial proximity to the perspective of her central character,  Gita, results in the demonization of the village. Gita’s view of the village is  shaped by her experiences, but those experiences seem merely to confirm  the implied author’s existing stereotypical negative urban expectations.  After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Gita discovers her  Jewish ancestry and is sent with her family to a concentration camp.  When she returns home in 1945, her father’s factory and the family house  have been seized by local Czechs, who consider her a Sudeten German,  imprison her in a barn and attempt to starve her to death, as they had her  brother a few weeks before. In 2005, their descendants fiercely resist her  efforts to reclaim her property. Their use of illegally obtained psychiatric  reports forces Gita to tell how, in the 1950s, she was gang-raped and saw  her infant son murdered by Prague youths, including one with origins in  her home village. For Gita, with her idyllic memories of childhood, it is  the Occupation that changed the Czech village. Denemarková, however,  implies that Gita has merely been forced to abandon her naive illusions  and recognize the permanent ‘inherited vulgarity and callousness’ of the  Bohemian village.19  The seizure of Gita’s family property amounts to a barbarian invasion  of urban civilization, an implicit metaphor for the fate of Czechoslovakia  from 1938 to 1989 that, for Denemarková, has yet to be fully reversed. As  an adolescent in 1945, Gita wishes she could say to the villagers eating from  her family porcelain: I am Gita Lauschmannová. The daughter of an educated mother, who was  brought up in the city, wore the scent of European cafés and found it so  hard to get used to life here. So my father built her this rectangular country  house. In the village they called this grand building with puzzled envy the  little chateau. I am Gita Lauschmannová.

In 2005, the elderly Gita declares: ‘I  don’t want to be compensated as a German. I want to be compensated as  a human being to whom an injustice has been done. Like a human being,  a citizen, who has been unjustly treated.’21 These ‘civic’ notions of justice,  transparency and human rights, so important to the post-1989 urban  intelligentsia, mean nothing to the village. Throughout the novel, urban  sophistication, which is shown to breed decency, contrasts with rural  coarseness — not created but nurtured by Nazism and Communism —  which breeds brutality. The village is repeatedly represented by images of  intimidating, Neanderthal masculinity, fleshy lips and masticating jaws;  the only villager with any conscience is a terrified, bullied woman who  has moved into Gita’s house, but helps the adolescent Gita escape and  later wants her to regain the property. Otherwise, only ‘the city’ is kind;  a sensitive military officer saves Gita from expulsion and enables her to  return to relatives in Prague. Positive characters, like Gita, speak in the  standard Czech of educated people, while the villagers use dialect, littered  with slang and swear-words, and are unable to understand the figurative  use of language. Their cruel intransigence contrasts with Gita’s planned  gesture of giving up her property in return for a monument to her father.   Towards the end, however, Denemarková unexpectedly softens her  position. Milena Marešová writes:  Denemarková at first makes frank and fierce accusations. She tears out  deeply rooted evil, claws open scars and makes the pain all the sharper by  showing that the originators and protagonists of the very worst things were  fellow countrymen, neighbours and local people. At the very end of the  book, however, the author incomprehensibly and against all logic makes  light of her accusations, relativizing and undermining all that had already  been said and argued.22 Denemarková moves closer to the indecisive position of Denis, the terrified  woman’s son, now an orthopaedic surgeon in Prague and, like Hájíček’s  narrator, caught between ‘the country’ and ‘the city’.

CHITNIS responds to his roots and becomes the village’s champion against Gita,  until her plan for a monument stirs the decency he has learned in the city.  His feverish efforts to help Gita cause his sister to disown him, but do  not achieve Gita’s aims. In despair, he tells her: ‘You know best of all that  I am the last person who would want to defend the residents of Puklice.  But... they mostly behave like this out of ignorance, the historical context  confuses them.’23 In keeping with the prevailing rhetoric in Czech society,  he then emphasizes the incomparably brutal behaviour of local Germans  during the occupation. Gita stops listening, all too accustomed to the  village’s — Czech society’s — inability to understand. Denemarková,  however, sympathizes with Denis; Gita dies with a new, troublesome  memory of her father wearing a swastika armband ‘so our lot (naši) leave  us in peace’.24  Both Peníze od Hitlera and Selský baroko demonstrate what Françoise  Mayer characterizes as the triumph of the ‘non-political’ view in post- Communist Czech efforts to ‘come to terms’ with their post-war history.  Despite efforts to heroize, demonize, commiserate and condemn, Mayer  suggests that the past has returned ‘“without incident” to those people,  who were not Party cadres, former prisoners or dissidents, who under  the Communists managed somehow not to be either for or against them  and who ultimately form the overwhelming — silent — majority of the  population’.25 Hájíček prefaces his novel with an admiring dedication to his  father, who worked uncomplainingly as a driver in industrial Ostrava after  his father’s land in South Bohemia was collectivized, and was ‘rewarded’  after 1989 with the chance to drive tourists round Europe. The only  possible response to the past, Hájíček suggests, is to acknowledge and move  on. Janoušek notes: 23  Denemarková, Peníze od Hitlera, p. 221. 24  Ibid., p. 238. 25  F.

This ‘silent’ majority was heard in a manner strongly reminiscent of the villagers’  treatment of Gita during the 2013 Czech presidential election, when outgoing president  Václav Klaus and his family sought to present the eventually defeated aristocrat, Karel  Schwarzenberg, as not merely insufficiently patriotic, but insufficiently Czech to hold the  office. As a child, Schwarzenberg fled to Austria with his family following the Communist  takeover, and speaks Czech with a marked accent. He nevertheless supported the anti- Communist opposition and returned in 1990 to head President Havel’s administration.  Klaus declared that he favoured a president who had experienced recent Czech history  first-hand and that he could ‘never forgive’ Schwarzenberg for characterizing the post-war  expulsion of Sudeten Germans as a violation of human rights; his son falsely suggested that  Schwarzenberg’s father was a Nazi sympathizer, and his wife expressed her discomfort at  the prospect of a First Lady who spoke German, but not Czech. </page> <page sequence="11"> THE COUNTRYSIDE IN CZECH FICTION SINCE 1989 441 The image of the village to which collectivization gave birth and which  pro-Communist literary works helped to reconstruct has been more or  less accepted by a large part of Czech society. It looks as though we have  moved on, and many of us behave in a way that shows no desire to return  to something that would cast too much doubt on our present way of life.26 Denemarková’s novel begins with an image of digging, but eventually,  like Hájíček, she chooses to compromise between the rural desire to  bury, and the urban desire to investigate. The result, Pynsent argues, is  enough ‘to please the Czech intelligentsia; a work of self-righteous national  sentimentalization’.27 Opening the Mind Denemarková and Hájíček ‘accommodate’ the reader, rendering the past  superficially attractive by emphasizing its relevance to the present and  making kitsch use of popular literary forms. Topol, by contrast, is not  interested in making his readers comfortable, but asks them instead to  abandon shared, received opinions for the alarming, uncertain solitude of  intellectual freedom, symbolized by the dangerous countryside beyond the  village. His move from the city to the village in Noční práce appears to have  been prompted by a desire to confront Czech nationalist mythology at its  heart. In 2002, he praises the post-Communist media for changing Czechs’  understanding of the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans: There is most probably the blood of twenty to thirty thousand murdered  people on Czech hands. We have a victim complex: Russians are evil,  Germans are evil, whereas we, with our ‘sweet little village’, are really nice  little people, with our clean hands and Hrabalian mug of beer. By the way,  [the film director] Jiří Menzel [b.1938] with his films bears his share of  guilt for this unproblematic understanding of [the writer Bohumil] Hrabal  [(1914–97)]. We like to erase any cruelty, any wounds or scars that we have  caused anyone. That disgusts me.28 26  Janoušek, ‘Co s tou kolektivizací?’, p. 76. Memoirs by Czech writers who grew up  from the 1950s onwards tend to recall visiting rather than living in the countryside as  children.

CHITNIS For Topol, after the organized brutality, massacres and expulsions to which  the Czech countryside was subjected and in which Czech rural people  collaborated, the renewed idealization of the Czech village in the 1970s and  1980s Normalization evokes what Theodor Adorno called the barbarism of  writing poetry after Auschwitz.29  In his 2000s novels, Topol shows how contemporary society seeks to  petrify the past through the ‘institutionalization’ of twentieth-century  history in education, public discourse and museums. This institutionalized  identity recalls Freud’s notion of the ‘cultural Über-Ich’. Freud writes: It can be asserted that the community, too, evolves an Über-Ich under  whose influence cultural development proceeds [...]. The Über-Ich of an  epoch of civilization has an origin similar to that of an individual. It is  based on the impression left behind by the personalities of great leaders,  men of overwhelming force of mind or men in whom one of the human  impulsions has found its strongest and purest, and therefore often its  most one-sided, expression [...]. Another point of agreement between the  cultural and the individual Über-Ich is that the former, just like the latter,  sets up strict ideal demands, disobedience to which is visited with ‘fear of  conscience’.30 In Topol’s novels, authorities like the police, army, religious orders,  academic historians, ministries of culture, the EU and political dictatorships  collaborate to protect this established identity from disruption. In Kloktat  dehet, boys in an orphanage who ‘tell lies’ are made by the nuns to  gargle tar. In Noční práce, a local state security commander orders: ‘End  obscurantism. To end it once and for all, to put a stop to evil, that is our  night work.’31 Topol associates this ‘cultural Über-Ich’ with the national  idyll of the village. His novels since 2001 portray a flight not from the  urban to the rural, but from this static, infantile dream to the ‘adulthood’  of ‘the country’ understood positively as Freud’s Es, a place of permanent  dynamic chaos and absent authority, where, through constant testing, the  paradigmatically in Vesnička má středisková (My Sweet Little Village, 1985), an enduringly  popular Menzel film, written by Zdeněk Svěrák (b.1936) in the spirit of Menzel’s earlier  Hrabal adaptations. In Noční práce, the village neighbours Zásmuky, the birthplace of  František Kmoch (1848–1912), the father of dechovka, patriotic Czech wind band music  that shares the jolly, collectivizing sentimentality of these films. 29  See B.

The authorities in fact  seek to preserve ‘obscurantism’; Topol considers it his ‘night work’ to resist  them.  The embodiment of the ‘cultural Über-Ich’ is the village pub in Noční  práce, an archetypal Czech setting, and the village orphanage in Kloktat  dehet, which both act as a metaphors for a Bohemia that imprisons its  people in a den of patriotic fairy-tales.32 As in Peníze od Hitlera, the village  in Noční práce is portrayed as hellishly hot. Topol writes: ‘The pub was  full. Old women were sitting in the hall on sacks of potatoes, chatting. In  the hall it was almost dark. You could smell the lavatories there. Yellow  flypaper was hanging from the pub ceiling, full of flies. The flies, buzzing,  were crawling over one another, coiling up in the slime, constantly trying  to fly away.’33 The flies recall those ‘shitting’ on the Emperor’s portrait in  the pub in Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války (The Fortunes of  the Good Soldier Švejk in the Great War, 1921–23) by Jaroslav Hašek (1883– 1923). The link is made explicit when one regular suggests that, to attract  a younger clientele, a picture of Švejk should be taken down and replaced  by a photograph of the singer Karel Gott, the modern embodiment of  the amoral Czech survivor.34 Like Denemarková’s village, the pub and  orphanage are the preserve of crass, intimidating men, who treat young  boys as a captive audience for their outlandish opinions and stories,  typified by Mr Cimbura in Kloktat dehet. His name, as Horák points out,  ironically recalls the idealized Bohemian farmer in the canonical 1908  rural novel, Jan Cimbura, by Jindřich Šimon Baar (1869–1925).35 A symbol  of the decaying national myth, Topol’s Cimbura grows increasingly infirm  and deformed.  In both novels, this decay is disturbed by ill-defined external events. The  images of incoming Red Army soldiers, displaced people, mass emigration  32  In Noční práce, a history teacher has a comic epiphany after being struck on the head:  ‘I’ve been lyin’ to schoolchildren me whole life [...] I tormented them with made-up heroic  epics about our race’ (ibid., p. 183). The truth about the founding of Bohemia, apparently,  is that Forefather Čech was too lazy to go any further and was left with the old, the sick,  pregnant whores, alcoholics with depression and children no one wanted, who somehow  survived and multiplied. 33  Ibid., p. 25. 34  In his first novel, Sestra (Sister, 1994, translated as City Sister Silver), Topol’s narrator  gives this type the name ‘Josef Vissarionovich Švejk’. The picture of Švejk is no doubt  by Josef Lada, whose naive drawings epitomize the comforting twentieth-century myth  of Czech identity, and make Hašek’s protagonist and the Czech countryside almost  impossible to visualize differently. 35  O.

CHITNIS and confusion evoke two periods in post-war Czech history, May 1945  and August 1968, when the national narrative briefly descended into the  flux that Topol favours. Topol maximizes the reader’s disorientation with  a chaotic narration designed to represent a child’s ‘un-institutionalized’  reception of events, filtered through his imagination, the books he has read  and the things he has been told. These two periods promised ‘liberation’, but  ended in the conformity of Stalinism and the Normalization respectively.  In Noční práce, with its epigraph from Georg Büchner’s Woyzeck, the  adolescent hero, Ondra, like his namesake Andres (Ondra in Czech) in  Büchner’s play, resists absorption into the madness that consumes his  surroundings. By contrast, the village in Noční práce, and the permanent  child, Ilja, in Kloktat dehet, bear comparison to Woyzeck, whose acceptance  of ever greater degradation and brutality drives him mad, until he becomes  an agent of violence himself.   In keeping with the Freudian parallel, both Ondra and Ilja are seeking  their fathers, but only Ondra, a lover of ‘Boys’ Own’-style stories, which he  lives out in the woods, learns to abandon this quest. Near the end of the  novel, he rebels against the stifling mediocrity of the ‘cultural Über-Ich’,  declaring in the pub: ‘I don’t want a life like this [...] I don’t want it!’36 Soon  after, he realizes that the man driving him and his brother into emigration  is not their father, but the village’s leading collaborator, who is going to  hand them over to the Russians. Ondra vows to change forever, to stop  doing what others order him and stop expecting anything from anyone  else. Martin Pilař writes: ‘Ondřej is tested and leaves the blessed world of  the child’s imagination. His younger brother, Malej [Little ‘un], remains on  the level of childish amazement.’37  The contrast between movement and stasis in Noční práce is captured  in the opening image of the frozen river surface, under which the water  continues to flow, a metaphor for time in Communist Czechoslovakia  before the ‘Thaw’ of the ‘Prague Spring’. At the height of the ‘thaw’, a pub  regular recalls how — during the war — parents threw their children from  a train passing through the village, and the villagers drowned the children  36  Noční práce, p. 226. 37  M.

Jaromír Slomek points out that ‘while [their father, the playwright  and poet, Josef Topol (b.1935)] experienced a proper rural childhood, for his sons it was  already a matter of summer trips into uncertain terrain’.

They cannot,  however, remember whether the children were Jewish or Sudeten German.  The river is no longer frozen, time is flowing and liberation seems possible,  until the Russians come. Like the dancer-narrator, Potok (meaning  ‘stream’) in Sestra, Ondra is associated with this flow, which symbolizes  endless renewal and freedom. He hides a boat, which he dreams of taking  to a distant rural utopia where his tribe can start again:  He thought of a valley, far away and cold. The snow there gleams because  the sun is shining. There is snow everywhere, even on the branches. He  also saw people. They were standing under trees. They were all his people,  people with whom he wanted to be. He will find faces and names for them.  He will not be alone there, certainly not. It will be quiet there.38 Ondra and Malej escape in their boat just as the river is starting to freeze  again and the village is on fire. As at the end of Topol’s second novel, Anděl  (Angel, 1995), the burning village signifies purification, the eradication of  evil, and the chance for a new beginning, at least for Ondra, Malej and the  implied reader.  Ondra has to act as a father to Malej, who cannot walk after being  hit by a car. By contrast, in Kloktat dehet, Ilja’s handicapped brother is  killed by orphans in a scene reminiscent of William Golding’s Lord of the  Flies, and Ilja thus remains a child throughout the novel. Critics routinely  compare him to Oskar Matzerath in Günter Grass’s Die Blechtrommel  (The Tin Drum, 1959), but he is more like Hrabal’s short, amoral waiter  Jan Dítě (John Child) in Obsluhoval jsem anglického krále (translated as  I Served the King of England, 1989), another novel influenced by Grass,  because he does not ‘refuse’ to grow up, but is not allowed to by his  institutionalized upbringing. The novel’s opening — ‘They called me  Ilja’39 — alludes to Říkali mi Leni (They Called Me Leni, 1948, revised 1959)  by Zdeňka Bezděková (1907–99), in which a girl growing up in post-war  Germany gradually realizes that she is really a Czech, who was selected  for ‘re-germanization’ during the Occupation after the execution of her  father. Like Leni, Ilja is a Czech in a German setting, and he travels around  the countryside seeking a father, just as Leni seeks her homeland. Topol  thus implicitly presents Bezděková’s novel — recommended reading in  Czech schools under Communism — as an instrument of the nationalist  38  Noční práce, p.251. 39  J. Topol, Kloktat dehet, Prague, 2005, p. 7. </page> <page sequence="16"> 446 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS indoctrination it purports to criticize.40 Given Topol’s rejection of the  affectionate ‘domestication’ of both Hrabal and Švejk, Kloktat dehet  may be read as a radical attempt to remind the reader of the insanity of  conformity at the heart of Obsluhoval jsem anglického krále. Just as Dítě’s  story follows Czech history from the First Republic to the early 1950s, so  Ilja’s story may be read as a fantastic retelling of that history from 1945 to  1989. In 1945 — or 1968 — Ilja, an average Czech, whose name derives from  the braying of an ass and perhaps — like Leni — evokes Vladimir Il ́ich  Lenin, adopts a Soviet army captain as his father and collaborates with the  Russians, but at the end of the novel kills the captain and returns proudly  to Bohemia with plans — in imitation of old Cimbura — to write his story.  The contest between the institutionalization and what Topol calls  the ‘revitalization’ of history returns in his fourth novel, Chladnou zemí  (Through a Cold Land, 2009), which satirizes international efforts to  transform the sites of twentieth-century atrocities into sanitized objects of  consumption, ‘houses of horrors’ conforming to current mythologies and  the needs and expectations of foreign tourists. In Bohemia, this process  appears complete. Having failed to protect his home town of Theresienstadt,  a transit ghetto for European Jews during the Second World War, from this  fate, the narrator travels to Belarus, where the accounts of the experience  of the Belarusian countryside put the Czech story of martyrdom and  suffering into perspective. Here, the frozen countryside is not a place of  potential liberation or renewal, but a mass grave hiding the full extent  of twentieth-century Central European violence and waiting for more  dead. The narrator joins a like-minded group striving to preserve this  countryside as a graveyard-museum, ‘The Devil’s Workshop’, an antidote  to the pastoral idyll. The president, however, decides instead to build a  motorway through it. The Belarusian campaigners do not despair: ‘there  is still time for a museum like this in this country. Do you know why?  Because the Devil is still damn hard at work here!’41 For them, as for Potok  in Sestra: ‘only wars lost in advance, only they are interesting.’42 Topol and  his heroes will keep moving out to the perilous periphery to continue their  ‘night work’, and hope the reader might join them. 40  For a discussion of this view of Bezděková’s novel, see R.

Her  objective is captured in the name of her fictional village, which derives  from želet, meaning to ‘pity’, ‘deplore’ or ‘grieve for’. Želary is set in poor,  isolated south-east Moravia, where Legátová worked as a school-teacher  after the Second World War, but the action is moved back to the 1930s,  in Horák’s view to challenge the Czech idealization of life in the First  Republic.43 In this interpretation, what Denemarková presents as a model  of democracy, decency and sophistication becomes synonymous with  the urban self-satisfaction that Legátová seeks to disturb. Judging by the  enthusiastic reception of Želary, ‘the city’ had been longing for just such a  lesson from, in effect, a new ‘grandmother’, a voice of ageless wisdom and  truth, emanating from the pure countryside, untouched by contemporary  ‘civilization’. Much to Ludvík Kundera’s irritation, reviewers accepted the  publishers’ claim that Želary was the eighty-two-year-old author’s first  work, when in fact between the late 1940s and 1970s Legátová, whose real  name is Věra Hofmanová, had written several radio plays and two books  of rural fiction under the pseudonym Věra Podhorná.44  In Želary, Legátová thus self-consciously continues the line of female  ethnographic writing that runs from Božena Němcová (1820–62) in the  1840s through Karolína Světla (1830–99), Růžena Svobodová (1868–1920),  Božena Víková-Kunětická (1862–1934) and Jarmila Glazarová (1901–77)  to the 1940s Silesia-based works of Ludmila Hořká (1892–1966). Mojmír  Trávníček notes that in Želary the ‘traditional motifs of rural fiction are  laid marvellously bare almost to their archetypes’.45 This effect is achieved  by shattering the chronology of the text, which reflects the experience  of the grandmother in one story, whose ‘world is disintegrating like the  world of a child into a thousand little fragments’.46 Each story contains  pieces of a larger jigsaw puzzle, which Legátová asks the reader patiently to  examine individually and put together, not only in imitation of the author’s  own process of recollection, but also as a gesture towards those characters  43  See O.

The book, which is presented as a cycle of self- contained stories, thus effectively becomes, as several critics have argued,  a Modernist rural novel.47  Legátová pointedly distinguishes between characters that do and do  not possess the will or ability to approach the villagers, especially children,  without prejudice. Those that do not are typically — like the implied  reader — comfortable, educated outsiders. Štěpán Vlašín highlights the  juxtaposition of the ‘irritable, bossy schoolteacher and the patient and  understanding parish priest’.48 The schoolteacher never loses the sarcastic  sense of superiority which he brings with him: ‘I got to know the village  through a series of slapstick events.’49 Legátová presents the whole  educational establishment as a failure, incapable of helping those in its  care. The teacher is compared unfavourably to the priest, who tells him:  ‘We make our biggest mistakes with children. The child’s soul is a flower  yet to blossom.’ The teacher brightened. ‘I’d like to know what would make  Vratislav Lipka blossom.’ ‘Vratislav Lipka really deserves our sympathy.’50 The priest’s sensitivity allows him to recognize the qualities and talents  hidden in the children, but also exposes him to debilitating doubt, which  undermines his capacity actively to help. He lacks strong faith in God and  his lenience at confession makes one parishioner lose hope of absolution.  Ultimately, like the teacher, he is rendered powerless by the discrepancy  between his ideal of humanity and the imperfect reality. He preaches:  ‘Only when you cease being slaves of the world, when you find good in  humility, when you prove capable of unconditional love, when faith is for  you no longer a chain of burdensome duties, but a blessing and a gift of  which you are not worthy, only then will you become Christians.’51  The implied author seems to agree with this judgement, frequently  contrasting poor children’s capacity to find joy in simple things with the  47  See, for example, P.

She doubts, however, that human beings  will ever change. She prefers the approach of the herbalist who, unlike  the teacher and priest, has no high expectations of her fellow villagers,  which liberates her to help them. The local doctor claims that his practice  would fail without her. The herbalist intuitively understands her people  and watches over them, almost mysteriously appearing whenever illness  or injury strikes, but wise enough to use the hospital when necessary. She  voices the priest’s (and Legátová’s) implicit advocacy of compassion rather  than chastisement, drunkenly declaring to a stunned visiting churchman:  The Old Testament God does have the qualities of a strict, punishing  father. The New Testament God is a Mother [...]. Immeasurable love for  that which is born from us, willingness to forgive, sacrifice and pity, that  is the essence of a Mother [...]. God the Mother is the home we abandon  to conquer the world and our whole lives we seek him again, call for  him, hurt, humbled, burdened with guilt. We betray God the Mother in  moments of Pride and call for Her in moments of Disaster because only  God the Mother will take our suffering on Herself.52 Vratislav Lipka is not reached by authority or reason, but by intuitive  experiences of empathy, whether on hearing verse by Jaroslav Seifert  (1901–86), or falling asleep among barn animals. Legátová writes: ‘Animals  inculcated timidity in him, they taught him patience and let him see  freedom as the basic principle of life.’ 53 It is ‘the country’, not ‘the city’,  that gives him insight into his existence. On finding a corpse in the snow,  he thinks: ‘The human being is nothing more than any other creature  who has been swallowed by the winter.’54 The remark may be read as Old  Testament judgement, mocking the modern urban human being’s illusions  of superiority, or New Testament love, reminding human beings that they  belong to Nature and share its vulnerability. The Return to Nature Bajaja and Vaculík share Legátová’s view of ‘the country’, its animals and its  physically harder way of life as a pre-eminent source of insight into human  existence. For them, as for Urban, renewed experience of Nature may not  only reawaken sympathy for other human beings, but also restore balance  to the lives of excessively urbanized human beings, for their own sake and  52  Želary, p. 192. 53  Ibid., p. 130. 54  Ibid., p. 132. </page> <page sequence="20"> 450 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS the sake of their environment. Bajaja and Vaculík’s portrayal of Prague  as inimical to a healthy, happy life follows a model established by their  fellow Moravian, Vilém Mrštík (1863–1912), in his 1890s novels. In Cesta na  Praděd, inhabitants of the city are depressed, exhausted, insomniac and  physically and mentally ill, their fragile condition epitomized by a young  Czech man determined single-handedly to bring about a Sorbian national  revival by writing verse in Upper Lusatian. His ambition comically reflects  the city’s muddled yearning for authenticity and purpose. In Bajaja’s Duely,  a Moravian farmer’s daughter moves to Prague after the war to marry an  ardent Stalinist, develops a Prague accent and a love of Socialist fake folk  songs, is divorced twice and becomes estranged from both her parents  and her children. In Zvlčení (Becoming Wolfish, 2003), the marriage of  Prague-based couple Tomáš and Markéta is in trouble, while their niece  has moved from the countryside to Prague only to become trapped in an  abusive relationship with a drug addict.  The narrator of Cesta na Praděd is accompanied on his journey by Josef  Zeman, the unconventional director of a farming school, and some of his  ‘apprentices’, a term that reflects the ideological bias of the industrialization  of the countryside. He hopes to rediscover a way of life that, like Zeman,  is ‘older, harder and manlier’.55 People lived ‘half outside the law’, survival  was harder, but personal freedom was greater. Vaculík’s company decide  not to take supplies, because ‘to travel in the awareness that every day  you have to work for the next day’s bread, to travel on and on because  you cannot stay long in one place, that is a different story and a different  responsibility! Travelling players, grinders, rag-and-bone men, pipers and  tinkers did not have it easy!’56 This plan would please the elderly farmer in  Duely, who complains that collective farm workers are paid regardless of  the quality of the harvest, when in fact ‘they should come to know [hunger]  while there is still time’.57 By returning to ‘the country’, human beings may  prepare themselves for tougher times to come, and even find the resolve to  avert them.  Vaculík repeatedly rues the replacement of horses by cars, which have  transformed the human being’s attitude to space, time, other beings and  his or her place in the world. The narrator asserts: ‘One of the features of  55  Cesta na Praděd, p. 20. 56  Ibid., p. 30.

He can  no longer imagine movement in it that is not motorized.’ 58 The rider uses  elements of his being that the motorist has all but forgotten. The horse, as  the agent of the fastest natural speed that a European human being can  experience, provides a natural limit to the human being’s conception of  how quickly something can be achieved. Moreover, by copying the horse’s  constant submission to the undulations of the earth, the human being  might relearn humility. E. F. Schumacher quotes Aquinas: ‘It is evident that  if a man practises a compassionate affection for animals, he is all the more  disposed to feel compassion for his fellow men.’59 Vaculík writes: ‘If today  the number of horses and different lives in general is in decline on this,  their one and only earth, then it seems to me our sense of respect for horses  and other lives in general is threatened, for which we shall ultimately pay  ourselves, and perhaps more heavily than horses.’60 All contemporary  human beings apparently need to do is get out of their cars and onto  horses, but that, as the narrator says of his own journey, is ‘a simple thing,  so hard to bring about’.61  The interference of technology in the relationship between human  beings and domestic animals features in Bajaja’s pre-1989 fiction.62 In  Zvlčení, however, he explores the extent of the human being’s separation  from Nature by paralleling the lives of a human and a wolf family, brought  together in the east Moravian mountains. John Berger argues that animals  constituted the first ‘other’ for human beings:   Animals interceded between man and their origin because they were both  like and unlike man. Animals came from over the horizon. They belonged  there and here. Likewise they were mortal and immortal. An animal’s  blood flowed like human blood, but its species was undying and each lion  was Lion, each ox was Ox. This — maybe the first existential dualism  — was reflected in the treatment of animals. They were subjected and  worshipped, bred and sacrificed.63 58  Cesta na Praděd, p. 158. 59  E. F.

Tomáš, Markéta, their lawyer-daughter, and their niece  first travel east from Prague to the mountains following the death of  Markéta’s father, a symbol of an older way of life that has definitively  passed. Their journey for them is from the tame to the wild. The wolf  family, by contrast, are driven to the same mountains from Transylvania.  Their migration recalls that of the ancient Czech tribes to Bohemia at  the beginning of Vančura’s first Obrazy z dějin národa českého (Scenes  from the History of the Czech Nation, 1939). Like the primitive Slavs, ‘the  emaciated beasts are urged on by the idea of a place providing sufficient  prey and peace and quiet’64 and, as in Vančura’s text, their journey is from  the wild east to the tamer west.   The east Moravian mountains are one of the least developed, most  peripheral Czech settings, but for the wolves, the evidence of the  encroachment of ‘the city’ on ‘the country’ — vehicles,  litter, stray domestic  animals — is overwhelming. Jiří complains that game-keeping has become  more a matter of accountancy than forestry. Like Hůlová and Topol, who  go outside the Czech Republic, to Mongolia, Siberia and Belarus, to find  a genuine ‘rural’, Bajaja voices Czech writers’ frequent sense that their  land lacks a sufficiently wild, exotic space, particularly since the loss of  Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia, which served this purpose for writers like  Olbracht, Vančura and Karel Čapek (1890–1938) during the First Republic.  The wolves are greeted by a hoarding advertising beer, a symbol of both  urbanization and domesticity that comes to mark one edge of their new  territory. The question, however, becomes whether the modern human  being is willing to live alongside them.  Bajaja suggests that the wolf fascinates human beings because they  recognize so much of themselves in them. Like the human being, the wolf,  on entering an environment, requires all other creatures there to adjust to  its presence:  The wild animals adapted [to the danger] through increased caution, and  gradually realized that wolves also have qualities that permit co-existence,  64  A. Bajaja, Zvlčení, Brno, 2003, p. 19. </page> <page sequence="23"> THE COUNTRYSIDE IN CZECH FICTION SINCE 1989 453 that their days are subordinated to rules and that (like the human being)  do not always have the intentions of hunters in mind.65 Bajaja also demonstrates the likeness by describing in parallel the changing  nature of love-making as the wolf and human couples grow older and more  familiar with one another, and using the same words to describe each  couple’s attempt to come to terms with the death of offspring.  What separates the wolf from the human being, however, is its unity  with its surroundings. Bajaja here gives unashamed expression to the  modern human being’s dream of how animals apprehend the world and  their place in it. When narrating from the wolves’ perspective, he conveys  the continuity of their connection with their surroundings by omitting  full stops and using short, indented lines to indicate their pauses to listen.  As the names of several wolves — Odin, Beltane, Genghis — suggest, they  continue to inhabit an ancient, mythic space and time, where dream and  reality intermingle, their memories and dreams merge with the memories  and dreams of all wolves, and ‘wolf is also Wolf ’. Bajaja uses lush lyrical  passages to show how the wolves experience their environment through all  their senses as a ‘symphony’, ‘an all-pervading chord of trees, herbs, soil  and mycelium, flavoured here and there with a ground beetle’s musk or a  wagtail’s inquisitiveness’.66 Their howl is described variously as a fugue,  a canon and plainsong, rising out of and inspiring awe in the life around  them. The discordant notes, alerting the wolves to danger, are provided by  human beings; the young he-wolf ’s call for ‘compassion and consonance’  is answered by the sound of a chainsaw and a falling tree.   By contrast, the human being’s experience of being is distanced and  fragmented. In Tomáš, a psychotherapist, an intuitive relationship with  Nature’s mysteries has been replaced by psychoanalytical theories that  attempt to explain them. The quarrelsomeness of human beings reflects  their disrupted, volatile apprehension of the world, whereas even the wolves’  fights serve to strengthen their bond. They are also more unthinkingly  capable of empathy. In one episode, they settle down to watch, with  curiosity and amusement, as the human family drinks around a campfire.  When two teenagers start arguing, ‘He-Wolf even panted in answer and  smacked his lips; perhaps, anticipating a scrap, he had remembered the  pack and begun to long for a proper chase’.67 In their readiness to reaccept  65  Ibid., p. 145. 66  Ibid., p. 186. 67  Ibid., p. 202. </page> <page sequence="24"> 454 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS human beings into their wilder existence, however, the wolves may risk the  corrupting domestication — and the declining ability to coexist — that has  befallen human beings.  At the end of the novel, the human and wolf families finally meet in  the forest, as they hunt the same herd of deer. On coming face to face  with He-Wolf, Markéta wrongly assumes that he intends to attack her, and  shoots him. Her family consider her action not only a logical response,  in keeping with a subconscious view of Nature as alien and potentially  hostile, but also a cause for celebration. Markéta, however, finds herself  suddenly distanced from this perspective. She is associated in the novel  with the legendary shepherdess and martyr, Margaret the Virgin, and,  according to her daughter, she seems still to retain a hereditary sense of the  ‘dualism’ described by Berger:  She was completely different. There was something almost defenceless in  her with regard to animals [...]. Just as the Old Testament is all blood and  passion, while the New proclaims love and compassion, so my mother  could on the same day help to slaughter a pig or go hunting and then chat  somewhere in a corner with a sick tom-cat. No split personality, just one  Bible.68 She is drawn mysteriously to She-Wolf, whose howling she alone hears as  mourning, rather than as a threat. Her eyes become honey-coloured, like  the amber eyes of the wolves. Sensing that She-wolf has come to the lodge,  Markéta goes out, kneels before her and looks into her eyes, unwittingly  imitating a young he-wolf ’s earlier behaviour when seeking forgiveness  and reacceptance. Tomáš, however, not seeing Markéta, and anxious to  demonstrate his own prowess, fires at the she-wolf, but kills his wife.  Modern human beings, Bajaja suggests, can only relate to Nature through  wretched attempts to assert their dominance, which are destructive and  will end in tragedy that the human being neither intends nor can imagine.  This assertion of supremacy is reflected linguistically in the title, which  is taken from the verb zvlčet, meaning ‘to go wild’ — literally, ‘wolfish’ — a  typical example of what Katy Soper calls ‘negative anthropomorphism’:  68  Ibid, p. 42. Berger writes: ‘A peasant becomes fond of his pig and is glad to salt away  its pork. What is significant, and is so difficult for the urban stranger to understand, is  that the two statements in that sentence are connected by an and not by a but.’ ‘Why Look  at Animals?’, p. 259. </page> <page sequence="25"> THE COUNTRYSIDE IN CZECH FICTION SINCE 1989 455 if we have turned to animals in an attempt to transcend the ‘loneliness’  or ‘alienation’ of our cultural status, we have also persistently used  them to preserve the culture-nature barrier [...] by associating all our  ‘lowlier’ characteristics and bodily functions with animality, we assert the  importance of sustaining those higher or more spiritual attributes that  grant us human sovereignty over the beast.69 In Zvlčení, however, it is better to be wolfish than ‘civilized’. Only two  human characters still attempt to co-exist intuitively with Nature and,  in keeping with Vančura’s view of the Czechs as irredeemably bourgeois,  both are from more ‘eastern’ Slav tribes. Ester, a witch-like peasant woman  from Slovakia, experiences reality most similarly to the wolves, aided by  home-brewed alcohol, and uniquely strikes no fear in them. Jadwiga, a  devout Polish Catholic and Markéta’s de facto step-mother, urges Tomáš to  accept Markéta’s death with humility, because ‘mourning [...] springs from  immaturity and pride’.70 She sends him the story of St Francis and St Clare,  which Markéta was reading just before she died. The copy was printed  from the ‘infernet’ by Jiří’s son, who, with his equal aptitude for hunting in  the forest and on-line, alone embodies the possibility of renewed balance  between the modern and traditional. For Bajaja, the spirituality inherent  in folk belief and traditional Christianity offers a path back to a more  balanced co-existence between human beings and their environment.  As Lubomír Machala writes, ‘becoming lupine is a goal or a means of  salvation, in the sense of a return by people to “pure” natural principles’.71  In effect, as Urban also argues in Hastrman (The Waterman, 2001), only by  becoming more savage may the human being be tamed.  In Hastrman, Urban counters the notion of the human development  away from Nature to culture by arguing for the preservation of a balance  between them in the human being. In the first part of the novel, set in the  mid-nineteenth century, the waterman objects to the parish priest’s claim  that local peasants are returning to paganism, arguing: ‘Perhaps they are  69  K. Soper, What is Nature?, Oxford and Malden, MA, 1995, p. 86.

In  this example of ‘negative anthromorphism’, which directly causes the tragic outcome of  Zvlčení, a trait more characteristic of human beings is transferred to a creature that human  beings would prefer to consider more ‘savage’ than they. 70  Zvlčení, p. 10. 71  L.

Perhaps it has always been here.’72 The balance  between Nature and culture is captured in the recurring, positive motif of  amphibiousness, incarnated in the waterman, who on land poses as a coldly  rational, educated nobleman, the embodiment of culture, but in water is a  fierce, instinctive creature, the embodiment of Nature. In a strong attack  on the Czech character, Urban has the waterman criticize the post-war  expulsion of Sudeten Germans for ending the ethnic ‘amphibiousness’  of his lands, claiming that the Germans would never have allowed the  Communists to devastate them.  In his novels, Urban frequently expresses nostalgia for the time when  human beings neither dominated nor lived in passive awe of Nature,  but were actively fascinated by its mysteries and power. Through a weak  English pun, his waterman, Johannes Salmon de Caus, appears to be  descended from the French hydraulic engineer, garden designer and  polymath, Salomon de Caus (1576–1626), whose work sought to imitate the  ‘engineering’ of Nature or, in Vaculík’s terms, to submit to the undulations  of the Earth. As Igor Fic argues, de Caus attracts Urban as a representative  of the Baroque ‘yearning to decipher the world of God’s creation, to break  through “to God through this world” [a quotation from the art and literary  historian Zdeněk Kalista (1900–82)] and thus attain salvation’.73 In his  major work, Les Raisons des formes et mouvements (1615, revised 1624), de  Caus sought to reveal what Luke Morgan calls the ‘divinely sanctioned  natural law’ underlying all phenomena, natural and man-made.74 The  waterman’s admiring description of his ancestors’ reconstruction of their  lands recalls de Caus’s method:  It was undoubtedly an artificial piece of work, but it respected the original  starting-points given by Nature: they built it in a place where lakes, pools  and swamps had been since time immemorial. This work made the place  accessible to human beings and benefited them without taking from the  marshy region its natural beauty and function.75  Over time, however, in Urban’s account, human beings change from  being admirers to being unregulated exploiters of Nature. Urban situates  the waterman’s lands in the region associated with the poet Karel Hynek  72  M. Urban, Hastrman, Prague, 2001, p. 110. 73  I.

In an 1854 play by the  Norwegian writer Andreas Munch (1811–84), de Caus declares to a Catholic  priest: ‘Thy deity is not my God! My God is Nature!’77 In the first part of  Hastrman, set in the mid nineteenth century, the waterman repeatedly  cites Feuerbach, who, in the foreword to his Vorlesungen über des Wesen  der Religion (1851), asserts that the ‘origin or cause’ of the human being  is ‘not God — a mystical, vague, ambiguous word — but Nature, a clear,  empirical, unambiguous word and essence’.78 For Feuerbach, Christianity  marked the culmination of monotheism and the shift in religion from  Nature towards the human being. In a debate with the local parish priest,  the waterman shows how these developments merely legitimize ever  greater human voraciousness:  You have taught them obedience and humility, the art of ridding  themselves of responsibility for sin. And he who comes after you will teach  them something else: a kind of lack of shame which he will declare the new  religion.79  The main defender of pantheism is the local squire’s rebellious  daughter, Kateřina, who leads a pagan cult that conducts ancient rituals in  the local countryside. She is appalled by the elaborate works undertaken  by the waterman to reactivate the local mill. For her, as for her patron, St  Catherine of Alexandria, the wheel symbolizes death, like the breaking  wheel into whose spokes the prisoner’s limbs are woven in Máj. The  waterman, however, only later realizes that the mill ‘project’ marks the  beginning of the industrial exploitation and destruction of his lands. A  76  Urban states that his inspiration for the waterman was ‘the land that I consider  my own and which is stupidly called Mácha’s. As a child I sailed in a boat around a lake  covered in thick green duckweed. I imagined that trees grew under the surface. That  people lived there who looked like fish. I found out much later, with a feeling of horror,  that reservoirs are filled and whole villages left at the bottom of them. That my fairytale  invention was actually quite real, if more romantic’.

Let people be people and let him be  their nightmare, their cautioning finger. Because if he does not do it, then  they will become the nightmare and their fingers will no longer warn, but  merely break and take.80 At the end of the first part, the waterman impregnates Kateřina and  takes her underwater, as Hades takes Persephone to the underworld  every autumn. His lands are thus left to a long, destructive ‘winter’ under  capitalism and Communism in ‘a plebeian state obsessed with production  and consumption’.81  In the second part of the novel, set in the 1990s, the pre-industrial rural  utopia of the waterman’s estate has been submerged (utopena, another  pun) by a huge dam and the waterman is conducting a campaign of eco- terrorism against the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen responsible.  He takes up with a group of peaceful environmentalists called Děti vody  (Water Babies),82 led by the charismatic Tomáš Mor, the namesake of the  author of Utopia (1516). Urban spells his surname like the Czech for ‘plague’,  perhaps in reference to the rash of utopian ideologies that Thomas More’s  model inspired. Kateřina joins the Babies, and becomes a model ‘friend  of the Earth’. While the waterman kills his enemies, the Water Babies  achieve their ends by peaceful means. They recover the village and begin  establishing an Edenic community based on solidarity with and deference  to Nature. Since human beings no longer need him, the waterman allows  himself to be sacrificed in a carnival ritual of renewal. Should human  history repeat itself, however, Kateřina is carrying his heir.  Critics disagree about how seriously to take the utopian ending.  Janoušek, while praising Urban for restoring ‘ideological’ writing to post- Communist Czech literature, detects a familiar totalitarianism in his  ecological message that scares him.83 By contrast, Anzhelina Pencheva  80  Ibid., pp. 154–55. 81  Ibid., p. 287. 82  The name may be a typically playful allusion to Charles Kingsley’s pro-Darwinian  1863 novel The Water Babies, which Urban perhaps encountered when living in London as  a child.

Urban  seems to have written the ending like Mácha wrote Máj, ‘a light smile on  his face, deep grief in his heart’. In an interview, Urban claims that the  violence reflected his anger at the state of Czech politics and public life,  personified for him by the former Prime Minister and future President,  Václav Klaus, an outspoken climate-change sceptic and proponent of  libertarian economics. The destructive exploitation of the countryside in  Hastrman serves as a metaphor for the dominance of corruption, greed  and commercialism in contemporary Czech society, epitomized by the  takeover of the Mladá fronta publishing house where Urban worked until  ‘in the spring of 2000 it was subjected to political and economic pressure  from above and forcibly transformed into a different type of publishing  house. He was the only person to leave the normalized publisher out of  sheer idealism’.85 Urban maintains that in the novel ‘I am settling scores  with people who made me angry a short time ago. I consider them the  people who are really harming this country. I have distorted the names,  but they can still be recognized’.86 With the ending, Urban playfully  realizes his sincere, but hopeless fantasies of revenge and the restoration of  respectful co-existence with Nature.  The Openness of Despair Hůlová’s novels Paměť mojí babičce (A Memoir for My Grandmother,  2002, translated into English as All This Belongs to Me), set in Mongolia,  and Stanice tajga (Taiga Station, 2008), set mainly in Siberia, satirically  explore ‘the city’’s persistent need for ‘the country’ as a metaphor for  the more general relationship between the self and other. Both novels  play with the fashion for travel literature, which transports readers from  their comfortable modern urban mediocrity to unfamiliar places that  offer a richer, more colourful and intense experience of life or confirm  the superiority of their own world. This fashion exemplifies Hůlová’s  implication in her fiction that people, including readers and writers,  84  A. Penčevová, ‘Vzadvpřed, aneb není snad všechno jinak?

CHITNIS prefer not to confront their problems, but to seek ways of feeling better. In  interviews, she appears amused by the perception of Paměť mojí babičce  as an ethnographic text, and hopes that readers ‘will find something more  general than just a story from an exotic world that has nothing in common  with our life here and now. For example, even here a clash arises between  the maintenance of classical norms and their transgression. I think that  they have this problem everywhere and a story set in Mongolia only puts  it in sharper focus, because there they really do not bother about a whole  series of things that obscure this problem for us’.87  Hůlová’s work implicitly rejects the ‘familiarity’ prevalent in  contemporary Czech fiction, which is commonly set in a recognizable,  shared notion of Bohemia, with predictable frames of reference and opinion  and narrators or main characters closely identified with the author. For  Hůlová, this method, despite appearances, inhibits self-discovery in favour  of self-affirmation. Instead, she favours distance and defamiliarization as  the means of achieving clarity. She claims that the characters and stories in  Paměť mojí babičce come from Prague and her own life.88 Much of what is  shown about Mongolia in the novel could equally belong to a stereotypical  view of Czech society and family life, from the fatty diet, matriarchal  household and internecine hostility to the ‘invented’ nationalism imposed  on children in school and the paradoxical superiority and inferiority  complexes of a lukewarmly patriotic nation caught between two larger  nations that behave like colonizers.  Hůlová thus uses the exotic ‘other’ not to escape the self, but to analyse  it more closely. She defines her writing as ‘coming to terms with what has  happened to me’.89 She is not easily identified with any of her characters;  instead, her novels may be read as ‘experiments’ in viewing existence from  ‘other’ perspectives and life experiences, through ‘other’ settings, with  the aim of learning more about her own.90 She detects a similar method  in another work commonly approached as an ethnographic text, the  monumental two-volume novel, Cesty na Sibiř (Travels to Siberia, 2008),  by the documentary film-maker, Martin Ryšavý (b.1967):  87  J.

C8.  </page> <page sequence="31"> THE COUNTRYSIDE IN CZECH FICTION SINCE 1989 461 [Cesty na Sibiř] is a meditation on the search for meaning. For the narrator,  this does not lie mainly in the shooting of a documentary film in Siberia,  but in the longing through this work to find out something about himself  [...]. Despite the extensive passages describing the local environment,  Cesty na Sibiř is above all auto-therapy.91  This approach reflects Hůlová’s perception, in both novels, that the  other is unreachable, and that any attempt to get to know the other results  only in self-delusion or, perhaps, greater self-understanding. In Paměť  mojí babičce, Hůlová juxtaposes the perspectives of five women — three  sisters, Dzaja, Nara and Ojuna, their mother, Alta, and Dzaja’s daughter,  Dolgorma — who have faced the choice between ‘the country’ or ‘the city’.  Several critics interpret the novel as an account of the decline of traditional  rural life,92 but the debate about the two settings is a red herring. The  subjectivity of each narration means nothing can be known for sure about  the quality of life in each setting, now and in the past, though both seem  horrendous.   Hůlová suggests that most people are pre-determined for a particular  environment, and struggle when removed from it. Nara complains of the  plants Dzaja buys to make their flat more ‘natural’:  Every plant likes something different, but it’s not always possible to do this.  If I give them too little water, the prickly ones are happy, but the flat-leaved  ones wither and their stems give way. If I give them too much water, only  the flat-leaved ones enjoy it and the others darken and the water in their  pots smells like a sewer.93  Dzaja and Nara are of mixed race — the children of affairs Alta had with  Chinese and Russian men associated with the city — and seem to belong  wholly to neither the steppe nor the city. By contrast, Ojuna, the child  of steppe parents, can, like city-born Dolgorma, only imagine life in one  setting, and loathes the other. Where characters ‘belong’ — or perhaps  hope to belong — is betrayed by their language. Even after life in the city,  Dzaja persists in using similes relating to sheep and horses, a reflection  of her carefully nurtured nostalgia for the steppe, whereas Dolgorma  compares things to ketchup and lift-shafts.94 91  P.

CHITNIS  Rather than admit their inadaptability, the characters persuade  themselves that their way of life is superior to the other. Each narrator  strives to recast a life marked by disappointment, degradation and failure  as a triumph. Dzaja presents her final return to the steppe, in middle age,  as a logical, happy ending: ‘When I sit in front of my ger, I feel like a Khan  princess.’95 Hůlová, however, disagrees: ‘Dzaja may say “I am at home here  and all this belongs to me”, but in fact this is a bit ridiculous. She is kidding  herself.’96 Dolgorma has found out about Dzaja’s life as a prostitute and  abandoned her, leaving her nowhere else to go but the steppe. The same  self-delusion is apparent in Alta’s dreams of becoming a ‘grandmother’  figure like her mother-in-law, Ojuna’s self-aggrandizement as a model of  the traditional rural wife and mother, and Dolgorma’s quest to find her  father, one of her mother’s clients.  The ‘city’’s attempt to get to know ‘the country’ is more comically  satirized in Stanice tajga. In 1946, Hablund, a middle-aged, married  businessman, decides to leave his Copenhagen home, the epitome of  Western comfort and civilization, in an attempt to compensate for his  failure to participate in the resistance against Germany. He is inspired by  a popular geographical magazine, Our World, to travel to a remote, poor,  backward Siberian village to observe the natives and report on their ways.  On his arrival, ‘he could feel that his heart was wide open and he was ready  to be much more understanding and generous than in Copenhagen’.97  However, when he meets his first local villager, in accordance with the  advice in Our World, he tries to find something to praise about him, but  cannot. Hablund never returns, and sixty years later, a young Danish  anthropologist, Erske, goes to look for him, hoping that he might make a  discovery that will earn him promotion, implicitly the only likely ‘impact’  of his research.   The encounter in the novel between ‘the city’ and ‘the country’ — or  the West and the East — resembles that between a psychologist and a  madman, in which the psychologist believes he has the knowledge and  skills to understand his patient, but is easily outwitted. Hablund is an  idealistic, clumsy but well-intentioned amateur, vainly struggling in the  opening scene to see himself and his rucksack in the mirror in his hallway  before he leaves.

Erske would no doubt dismiss  Our World, but the anthropological theories through which he filters  his experiences are even less useful because they prevent unmediated  contact with the villagers, just as in Topol’s Chladnou zemí, contemporary  historiography is shown not to uncover, but to mask the past. Erske misses  the opportunity of a love affair with the wife of Fedorek, a conductor on  the Trans-Siberian Railway, because he views their relationship as a case  study in research ethics. He eventually leaves the village, without learning  Hablund’s fate, disillusioned not so much by his theories as by the local  people’s failure to live up to them. By contrast, Hablund gradually believes  he is becoming accepted; as summer turns to autumn, villagers start  greeting him by cheerily squeezing his arms, apparently in the manner of  a tribe described in Our World, and then he is invited to join the annual  reindeer hunt. The hunt fails, however, and the villagers eat well-fed  Hablund instead, perhaps as they had always intended.   Fedorek learns more about the village and its past than Hablund and  Erske. Like Dzaja, he is genetically split between ‘the city’ and ‘the country’,  since his father fled to Siberia during the siege of Leningrad and married a  local villager. Unlike Denemarková and Hájíček, for whom this combination  breeds weakness, Hůlová, like Urban, favours amphibiousness. In a world  where answers cannot be found anywhere and the modern human being is  equally alienated in all settings, the most authentic way to live, it seems, is  to drift endlessly between them, like Fedorek and Dzaja, and like she does  in her novels, set alternately abroad and in Prague. Conclusion Most writers discussed here place their hope in ‘openness’ as a means  of coming to terms with the past, liberating human beings from dogma  and restoring their compassion for one another and Nature. Hůlová’s  ‘openness’ by contrast, is bleak and daunting, Topol’s dangerous, uncertain  landscape without the incorrigible adventurer’s optimism, and with little  hope of what contemporary psychology calls ‘cognitive closure’ or genuine  empathy. The pessimism in the 2000s ‘return to the rural’ can be linked  not only to disillusion with the Western society and culture that the Czechs  rejoined after 1989, but also a perception that post-Communist Czech  society had become a continuation of late Communist society, whether  in political practices, the perpetuation of post-war myths or modes of  thought, the urbanization of the countryside or the seamlessness between  </page> <page sequence="34"> 464 RAJENDRA A. CHITNIS Marxist-Leninist materialism and late-twentieth-century capitalism. The  banality of some messages in the works discussed may say as much about a  perceived absence of common sense in the paths followed in recent Czech  and human history as the limitations of their authors. ‘Returns to the  rural’ often seek to slow or halt the momentum of ‘the city’ in a particular  direction. They remind people of older truths that they appear to have  forgotten or dismissed, and their repetitiveness itself seems to undermine  ‘urban’ notions of development and progress. By contrast, the 2000s  ‘return to the rural’ seems to crave movement and change.   The break with the post-1989 consensus is evident in the renewed  fascination with the East, so soon after the departure of Soviet troops,  as a source of less pampered and enfeebled, more rounded humanity. In  both content and style, these works escape the narrow preoccupations  of much mainstream 1990s Czech fiction, which was dominated by  autobiographical, notionally ‘authentic’ accounts of life under Communism  that, in its implicit attempt to create a post-Communist collective based  on shared experiences and beliefs, recalled the poetics of first-person- narrated sanctioned realism during the Normalization.98 For the writers  discussed here, ‘the country’ is not only a political device, but also a rich  source of creative possibilities. Their preoccupations with the state of  contemporary human beings, their environment and their capacity to  face the challenges of the future, moreover, resonate with those of writers,  scientists, sociologists, economists, historians, philosophers, the media  and wider public throughout the industrialized world. In the 2000s, most  uncharacteristically in Czech literature, ‘the country’ becomes the source  of renewed cosmopolitanism. 98  For a discussion of this poetics, see R. B.
