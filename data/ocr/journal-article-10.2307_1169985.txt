<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Educational Research Fall, 1979, Vol. 49, No. 4, Pp. 557-576 Extrinsic Reward and Intrinsic Motivation: A Review with Implications for the Classroom John A. Bates University of Massachusetts The notion that certain systems of reward may inhibit children's desire to participate in educational activities was investigated by reviewing recent re- search on intrinsic motivation. This research was critiquedfromfour theoretical perspectives: self-perception theory, personal causation, the overjustification hypothesis, and behavioral contrast. Studies were grouped according to the independent variables (reward systems) demonstrated to have the greatest effects on subsequent motivation. General trends observed in the results of this research included detrimental effects both of participation-contingent and of task-inherent rewards, and the motivational value of unambiguous social reinforcers. It was suggested that the contradictory nature of the bulk of reviewed results was-partly due to the failure of researchers to commonly define intrinsic motivation, andfurther research using a variety of dependent measures was encouraged tofacilitate evaluation of classroom reward systems. The apparent inability of the American educational system to preserve and enhance the interest in exploration and learning that seems to be intrinsic to most children when first entering school has been cited recurrently in the literature of the field (Bruner, 1968; Dewey, 1900; Goodman, 1962). Whether learning for the sake of learning is a phylogenetic characteristic of the human species, the product of continually lengthening schedules of reinforcement, or a high level skill achieved through the development of some cognitive process, is a debatable, if not empirical, issue. Nevertheless, many long-standing educational procedures have been changed with stultifying learning motivation in children. The often casual use of a variety of classroom systems of reward to control disruptive behavior or to increase academic achievement has recently been criticized as being one of the chief threats to the desire to learn. For example, Levine and Fasnacht (1974), in citing prior research on intrinsic motivation in children, con- cluded that one of the most powerful tools available to the teacher for affecting student behavior (the classroom token economy) may lead to nothing more than token learning. Their fear is that the supplying of a student with extrinsic incentives for learning may be an artificial procedure, unlikely to be paralleled outside the classroom, which may ultimately undermine the inherent human desire to learn for the sake of learning. The evidence against classroom reward systems is not, however, without ambigu- ities. Some researchers (notably, Feingold &amp; Mahoney [1975] and Reiss &amp; Sushinsky 557</page><page sequence="2">JOHN A. BATES [1975]) have found no empirical basis for the contention that token economies, at least, harm intrinsic motivation. Further, those researchers who have noted such "ill effects" have themselves frequently warned against a premature condemnation of all reward systems (Lepper &amp; Greene, 1976; Lepper, Greene, &amp; Nisbett, 1973). Never- theless, the implicit goal of a responsible educational program must be the production of individuals capable of autonomous learning. Any stratagem that increases the learner's dependence on artificial contingencies extant only within the program detracts from that goal. If it has indeed been demonstrated that certain classroom systems of reward often undermine student interest in the learning process, and that these contraindications are not exclusive to contrived laboratory environments, then a careful reevaluation of the use of such procedures is clearly mandated. Before reviewing the research and theory relevant to classroom intrinsic motivation, it should be clear as to what the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation mean in the context of this paper. Although infrahuman research may seem to be an inappropriate source for definitions of human intrinsic motivation, it nevertheless provides a useful analog. Berlyne (1966) has suggested two components to inherent curiosity in animals: specific (goal-directed) exploratory behavior, and diversive (novelty-directed) exploratory behavior. Goal-directed behavior in infrahuman re- search generally describes activities prior to and directed toward receiving extrinsic reinforcers. This description parallels the notion of human extrinsic motivation. That is, humans often engage in activities for the (apparently) sole purpose of receiving tangible rewards. In contrast, novelty-directed behavior involves the seeking out of "stimulation, regardless of source or content, that offers optimum amounts of novelty, surprising- ness, complexity, change or variety" (Berlyne, 1966, p. 26). It has been similarly noted that humans often appear to perform a task for no reason other than the satisfaction inherent to task participation and completion. The process that leads to this behavior in the absence of external rewards has been labeled intrinsic motivation. Theoretical Approaches to Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation Differing theoretical perspectives have modified these simple descriptors of intrin- sic and extrinsic motivation to more fully encompass human behavior. Four of these perspectives will next be discussed. It should be noted that although each position offers a slightly different interpretation of the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, none of them offers clearly unique predictions of interrelationships with systems of reward. Behavioral Contrast The phenomenon of behavioral contrast has been well established in infrahuman research (e.g., Freeman, 1971; Reynolds, 1961; Terrace, 1968). Although it is a descriptor of behavior and not a theory, it is included in this discussion since it offers the most functional approach to intrinsic motivation. The general paradigm used to demonstrate contrast involves training an animal to perform a task on dual schedules of reinforcement. Once behavior has stabilized under both schedules, if the frequency of reinforcement in one schedule is changed, the response rate under the other schedule will change in the opposite direction. Negative contrast is said to have occurred when the frequency of reinforcement is 558</page><page sequence="3">REWARD AND MOTIVATION increased in one schedule, resulting in a decreased response rate under the other schedule. Feingold and Mahoney (1975) have argued that experimental demonstrations of the inverse relationship between human intrinsic motivation and systems of extrinsic reward may not be phenomenologically different from the process of behavioral contrast. A detailed critique of their evidence in support of this contention is reserved for a following section. However, a brief description of the typical intrinsic motivation paradigm is necessary for an understanding of their argument. In general, subjects are requested to perform a task judged to be interesting by the experimenter. For their participation, subjects are then presented with some tangible reward (e.g., money, tokens, symbolic awards). Either immediately following rein- forcement, or at some later time, subjects are permitted to interact with the experi- mental task in a free-choice mode. The amount of time subjects spend with the task is compared either with time similarly spent by a nonrewarded control group or with time spent by the subjects themselves in a pretreatment free-choice period. Rewarded subjects who spend less time during the posttreatment free-choice period than either type of control group are said to have experienced a decrease in intrinsic motivation. Two issues of import immediately arise from this general research paradigm. First, the concept of intrinsic motivation has been experimentally operationalized as time freely spent on an activity in the absence of extrinsic rewards. Second, such a definition combined with the differential reinforcement procedures outlined above may be interpreted as the human analog of demonstrations of infrahuman behavioral contrast. Certainly, no guarantee exists in behavioral research that similar behavioral outcomes in different species (rats or pigeons vs. humans) may be the result of the same underlying process. Nevertheless, the behavioral contrast approach presents perhaps the simplest description of the ill effects of extrinsic reward on intrinsic motivation. Self-perception Originally suggested as an operant psychology alternative to cognitive dissonance theory (Bem, 1967, 1972), self-perception theory posits that motivation is a product of response patterns learned through acculturation. That is, humans learn through experience that other humans engage in activities to a degree dependent on the expected outcomes of pay-offs of the activities. These observations lead individuals to the generalization that motives for engaging in any activity may be deduced from the tangible gains to be realized from participation. Thus, if individuals perceive their task participation to eventuate in powerful extrinsic reinforcers, they may view these reinforcers to be the locus of causality for their participatory behavior. Such individuals are said to be extrinsically motivated. If, however, task participation carries with it no (or very little) salient contingent reward, individuals will perceive their participation to be a product of their own volition, and may be said to be intrinsically motivated. Although it may at first appear logical to assume that rewarding individuals for performing a task which might otherwise have been engaged in for intrinsic motives alone should increase the incentive for continued performance, self-perception theory predicts that such rewards will decrease the probability of future task participation if 559</page><page sequence="4">JOHN A. BATES the reward is withdrawn. This will occur because individuals will experience a shift in the perceived locus of causality for their behavior from the original intrinsic motives to the extrinsic reward. Removing the reward will then decrease both motivation and subsequent activity. Self-perception theory also carries with it the possibility that such a reward- motivation interaction need not necessarily occur. It will occur to the extent that a reward is perceived to be salient to the task which is to be rewarded. A reward may have other properties (such as conveying a sense of competency) which may over- shadow the magnitude of the reward, or the task may be so entertaining that any rewards are perceived as only tangential to participation. It is not inconceivable, for example, that a highly paid automobile assembly line worker may have a different level of intrinsic motivation than a similarly paid university professor. Given the condition of reward salience, however, self-perception theory clearly predicts detri- mental effects on intrinsic motivation. The Overjustification Hypothesis The overjustification hypothesis is a direct offshoot of self-perception theory, and predicts that intrinsic interest of individuals in an activity will be undermined by inducing them to engage in that activity as an explicit means to some extrinsic goal. Oversufficient extrinsic incentives will be perceived as the locus of control for behavior (Lepper et al., 1973). According to this approach, the nature of an extrinsic reward is a variable with little or no effect on intrinsic motivation. Oversufficiency of reward, then, describes the condition of receiving any reinforcement beyond that which in the past has sufficed to justify task participation, even if the "reinforcement" is insubstantial or merely symbolic. This perspective of intrinsic motivation differs slightly from the above interpreta- tion of Bem's (1967, 1972) self-perception theory. Lepper et al. (1973) have defined intrinsic motivation as the process leading to task participation in the absence of perceived, salient, unambiguous, and sufficient extrinsic rewards. While Bem's approach may be interpreted to suggest that an individual's reevaluation of locus of causality is, at least in part, a function of task and reward parameters, Lepper et al. have argued that any extrinsic contingency beyond that which is currently maintain- ing any behavior will interact with intrinsic motivation. This prediction, combined with corroborative research, has led to a criticism of contractual classroom techniques which offer rewards irrespective of differing initial levels of individual interest in activities. Personal Causation DeCharms (1968) has suggested that intrinsic motivation may be distinguished from extrinsic motivation by relative feelings of personal causation. Individuals who derive satisfaction from having accomplished something through individual effort will perceive themselves to be the origin of their own behavior. This perception of personal causation will foster a high level of intrinsic motivation. Alternatively, individuals who primarily derive satisfaction from the possession of objective rewards which result from their efforts will perceive themselves to be pawns under the control of those extrinsic contingencies. This perception will foster high levels of extrinsic motivation. 560</page><page sequence="5">REWARD AND MOTIVATION Personal causation makes a prediction similar to those of the previously mentioned theoretical perspectives in regard to the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. That is, intrinsic motivation will decrease if an extrinsic reward is obtained in a situation where individuals normally perceive themselves to be the origin of their behavior. However, personal causation makes the additional prediction that intrinsic motivation will increase if expected rewards for task completion are withheld. This will occur, according to deCharms (1968) due to a necessary reevaluation of the origins of the behavior. This second prediction seems logically untenable, since its application would suggest that the aforementioned automobile assembly line worker would find his or her job more intrinsically motivating if his or her pay envelope were discovered to be empty! This probable absurdity aside, personal causation seems to differ from the other theoretical perspectives only to the extent that it provides labels (pawn vs. origin) for the perceptual outcomes of reward-motivation interac- tions. The four perspectives presented above reflect a continuum of increasing reliance on hypothetical constructs and cognitive processes to describe and explain the same behavioral outcomes. Of course, they do not exhaust the arsenal of theoretical approaches to relationships between rewards and behavior. For example, an analysis of differential response probabilities (Premack, 1965) may also account for postre- ward reductions in time spent engaging in target tasks by noting concurrent increases in time spent engaging in alternative and competing activities. Further, the concept of achievement motivation (e.g., Atkinson, &amp; Feather, 1966; McClelland, 1961), especially as it has been applied to children's behavior in an academic environment (see Maehr [1976] for a discussion of this approach), closely parallels the notion that individuals possess an inherent desire to (successfully) participate in stimulating endeavors, and offers alternative explications of the reward-motivation phenomenon. However, to fully review all the potential theoretical conceptualizations of intrinsic motivation would be far beyond the scope of this paper. The perspectives that have been reviewed provide a satisfactory framework within which the results of most of the research on intrinsic motivation may be evaluated. The following sections will briefly review much of this research according to the independent variables which have been domonstrated to have the greatest effect on intrinsic motivation. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to clearly differentiate between two of the most often manipulated variables: contingent and noncontingent rewards. In all cases where a reward or reinforcer has been described as contingent, this term refers to a schedule of reinforcement based on a subject's level of perform- ance on the experimental task. A noncontingent reward, in contrast, is one which has been delivered based only on the subject's participation in the experimental task, independent of the level of performance. The importance of this distinction will become apparent when the implications of the various methodologies for classroom systems of reward are discussed. Variables Affecting Intrinsic Motivation Contingent-expected rewards An early study by Harlow, Harlow, and Meyer (1950) provides some insight into the interaction between human intrinsic and extrinsic factors, if again from an infrahuman perspective. Harlow et al. presented rhesus monkeys with a latch-puzzle 561</page><page sequence="6">JOHN A. BATES that could be opened only by following several prescribed steps. The monkeys showed great interest in the puzzle, and quickly learned to solve it. Several of the monkeys were then deprived of food for 22 hours. The experimenter baited the puzzle-latch with a bit of food in the presence of the deprived animals and returned it to them. The monkeys reportedly attacked the previously mastered puzzle without regard to the manipulations necessary to open it. When it was opened and the food eaten, the monkeys demonstrated no interest in continued play with the puzzle. DeCharms (1968) has cited this study as evidence of the ill effects of extrinsic reinforcers, and as support for a theory of cognitive reevaluation of the locus of causality for behavior. However, alternative hypotheses for the behavior of the rewarded monkeys include fatigue, satiation, and an increase in arousal (due to deprivation) far above the optimum level, which hindered rather than enhanced activity (Berlyne, 1966; Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908). Moreover, to ascribe the cognitive capacity to evaluate complex motives for behavior to monkeys (however intelligent) seems more anthropomorphic than empirical. Still, this infrahuman research closely parallels the results of other studies involving the effects of contingent-expected rewards on human behavior. Deci (1971) rejected the infrahuman evidence of an interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors on much the same bases as described above. He therefore attempted to demonstrate such an interaction effect within the framework of self- perception theory. In his first series of experiments, Deci hypothesized that different rewards may have different effects according to the interpretation of the individual. Specifically, money may be interpreted as a causal agent for an activity which originally was highly intrinsically motivating. To test his hypothesis, Deci presented 24 college students (who were satisfying course requirements) with a puzzle-solving task (Soma, a commercial puzzle com- posed of seven differently shaped pieces which may be fitted together to form a nearly infinite variety of configurations). Subjects were asked to reproduce several configurations which had been drawn on paper for them. Twelve subjects were instructed that they would receive one dollar for each correctly solved puzzle. The other 12 were instructed only to solve as many puzzles as they could, with no mention of a reward. After the experimental session, all subjects were given an 8-minute, free-choice period, wherein they could continue solving puzzles or read a variety of magazines. The control (unpaid) subjects spent significantly more of their free-choice time on puzzle-solving than the experimental (paid) subjects. This, according to Deci, indi- cated a decrease in intrinsic motivation due to a shift in the perceived locus of causality for task participation. Deci then attempted to replicate his results in a field setting. His subjects were eight college students who worked as headline writers for a biweekly newspaper. Half the subjects were paid $.50 per headline written during the experimental phase, and half were paid nothing. After termination of the payment, unpaid workers wrote significantly more headlines than paid workers. This was again reported as evidence that contingent-expected rewards decrease intrinsic motivation. Although the Deci (1971) research suggests that "something happened" as a result of experimental manipulation of contingencies, it is difficult to ascribe that "some- thing" exclusively to a change in intrinsic motivation. Deci assumed that his puzzle- solving task was intrinsically motivating for all subjects. His only attempt to verify that assumption was a post hoc measure of students' attitudes toward the task. All 562</page><page sequence="7">REWARD AND MOTIVATION students indicated that the task was enjoyable. However, this result may also be explained in terms of dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957). That is, subjects who were not rewarded rated the task as highly as the rewarded subjects because they needed to justify their participation. Further, if one accepts the notion that extrinsic rewards decrease intrinsic motivation, one should expect to find subjects who were rewarded to rate the task as less enjoyable than did the nonrewarded subjects. This contradiction may reflect only a low correlation between the attitudes subjects express to experi- menters in pencil-and-paper surveys and their observed behaviors, or it may reflect deeper theoretical problems. In addition, it is not unreasonable to doubt the level of intrinsic motivation involved in Deci's field study. Headline writing seems less an inherently interesting exercise than it does a tedious, boring task. Another study conducted by Deci (1972b) was intended to demonstrate no conceptual discrepancies between the inequity theory of Adams (1963) and self- perception theory. Adams has suggested that the observed level of task performance is a function of the degree of inequity in the input-outcome ratio perceived by an individual. His research (1963; Adams &amp; Rosenbaum, 1962) demonstrated that a person paid by the hour will increase his or her performance if the pay appears to be inequitably large, and that a person paid piecework will decrease his or her perform- ance if the pay appears to be inequitably large. Thus, where intrinsic motivation is defined as level of task performance, it can be manipulated according to the schedule of reinforcement and the intensity of the reward. Deci presented 96 subjects with the same Soma puzzle used previously. Each subject solved puzzles in one of six conditions: (a) not rewarded, (b) rewarded with money before the free-choice period, (c) rewarded with money after the free-choice period, or (d), (e), and (f), verbally rewarded in combination with one of the first three. In all money-rewarded conditions, subjects were aware of the forthcoming reward. The predictions were essentially identical to those of Deci's studies of 1971, with the exception that subjects who were paid before the free-choice period were expected to spend a greater proportion of free-choice time on puzzle-solving as a result of a perceived inequitable input-outcome ratio. That is, these subjects would perceive that they were paid more money than the task deserved, and would, consequently, attempt to compensate for the overpayment by a high level of puzzle-solving activity during the free period. The results supported Deci's predictions. The unpaid subjects spent a significantly greater proportion of their free-choice time on puzzle-solving than either of the paid groups; and, subjects paid prior to the free-choice period spent more time with the puzzles than subjects paid after the free-choice period. (The results of crossing monetary rewards with verbal rewards will be discussed later.) Although Deci has viewed this research as indicative of no conceptual discrepancies between inequity and self-perception, that conclusion may not be compelling. Self- perception theory argues that, if a person is given extrinsic rewards for performing a task perviously intrinsically motivating, that person may reevaluate the locus of causality for his or her behavior, thereby reducing subsequent intrinsic motivation. Inequity theory, in contrast, would predict that rewards would be evaluated in relation to expended effort, and that an unreasonably large reward would lead to increased activity (intrinsic motivation). On one hand, Deci's results disconfirm self- perception theory, because subjects paid before the free-choice period showed an 563</page><page sequence="8">JOHN A. BATES increase in intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, his results disconfirm inequity theory, since subjects paid after the free-choice period showed a decrease in activity. Deci has offered no theoretical explanation for the implication that expected rewards are more powerful inhibitors of intrinsic motivation than received rewards. How such an explanation would fit neatly into either theory is difficult to imagine. Deci's assumption that the "three to four dollars" (1972b, p. 117) paid to subjects in the rewards-before condition constituted an unreasonable remuneration may also have been unwarranted. It seems that the only justification for this was a post hoc evaluation of the data. If anything, this study demonstrates the inadequacy of at least two popular theories of intrinsic motivation to deal with all potential task- reward parameters. Calder and Staw (1975a) have offered an additional criticism of the Deci research. They have pointed out that none of the Deci studies reported performance data for the experimental task. "It is thus unclear whether any change in free time spent on the task is due to a change in intrinsic motivation or merely to differences in performance" (p. 77). It may have been that the contingently rewarded subjects expended more effort on the experimental task and that their consequent drop in free-choice puzzle-solving time was attributable to satiation or fatigue. Evidence conflicting with the results of Deci's research has been presented by Reiss and Sushinsky (1975). They have argued that any exposure to a salient rewarding stimulus (such as the promise of monetary reinforcement) prior to exper- imental treatment, may result in a variety of competing responses. Their "competing response" hypothesis predicts that such perceptual or cognitive distractions will disrupt task performance to the extent that continued participation in a free-choice mode will become less desirable or satisfying. Reiss and Sushinsky selected six girls and three boys from a kindergarten class to demonstrate that contingent-expected rewards (in the context of a more traditional token paradigm) can increase intrinsic motivation by controlling for competing responses. Subjects won poker chips by listening to one of three target songs over 10 reinforcement trials of varying intervals (10 to 100 seconds), and were able to redeem their chips for a variety of toys. Forty-eight hours after training, the subjects were given a 5-minute, free-choice period to listen to any of the three songs in an environment very similar to the experimental setting, and in the presence of two adult observers. The results confirmed the hypothesis: subjects listened to their target songs significantly longer than to either of the other two songs. A crucial problem exists within the methodology presented by Reiss and Sushinsky which makes their interpretation of these results questionable. Posttreatment testing of the subjects' intrinsic motivation to listen to their target songs was conducted in an environment that may have been indistinguishable (for kindergarten children) from that which had previously been associated with potential rewards. Lepper and Greene (1976) have pointed out that this amounts to a discrimination-learning paradigm, wherein the subjects had not yet learned to properly discriminate between external contingencies for reinforcement and nonreinforcement. What Reiss and Sushinsky (1975) have demonstrated, according to Lepper and Greene, is that the use of token extrinsic reinforcers is effective in maintaining learned behavior provided the external contingencies for potential rewards be maintained. An additional study of the effects of contingent-expected rewards in the operant tradition deserves mention. Feingold and Mahoney (1975) have cited a number of methodological deficiencies common to previous research in intrinsic motivation: 564</page><page sequence="9">REWARD AND MOTIVATION procedures have not been analogous to token economies (experimental sessions have been brief and without mention of a reinforcement effect), there has been a general lack of independent observations, conclusion have often been drawn from marginal results, there has been a neglect of the relevant literature on behavioral contrast, and there has been a lack of control for discrimination learning. For these reasons, Feingold and Mahoney have reported a methodology design to demonstrate a reinforcement effect, to parallel normal classroom token economies, and to provide continuing measurements sufficient for examining temporal trends and transition states. Five randomly selected, second-grade children served as subjects for this study. The experimental task involved connecting dots to form pictures in follow-the-dots booklets. An initial baseline measure of the number of dots connected without extrinsic reinforcement was collected for each subject over a 2-week period. Subjects were then rewarded with points, to be exhanged for toys, for connecting dots in excess of their best baseline performance. Reinforcement continued over four sessions (1 week). A second baseline without reinforcement was then established over a 2- week period. Following a 2-week interval of no experimental contact, a third 2-week baseline was recorded. The results indicated an increase in mean responses during the reinforcement procedure, followed by a drop in responding during subsequent baselines which nevertheless exceeded original baseline measures. Contrary to other research, the children displayed an average increase of 95.08% in performance from Baseline 1 to Baseline 3. Although Feingold and Mahoney (1975) have stated that their results "cast doubt on the assertion that extrinsic reward necessarily undermines intrinsic motivation" (p. 375), a careful look at their data may suggest otherwise. Of the five subjects participating, the two who showed the greatest increase from first to third baseline were those who had the lowest level of Baseline-1 activity. Moreover, the subjects who had the highest level of Baseline-1 activity showed the least change on Baseline 3 and demonstrated a trend toward activity decreasing below Baseline 1 if the third baseline period had been extended. If the individual subject performances are considered in this fashion, rather than mean performance across subjects, the outcomes appear well within the predictions of at least the overjustification hypothesis presented by Lepper et al. (1973) and Lepper and Greene (1975). Specifically, subjects with low initial, intrinsic motivation will display an increase in that charac- teristic following reinforced exposure to a potentially intrinsically motivating activity. Similarly, subjects high in initial, intrinsic motivation may tend to decrease activity to the extent that they are confronted with extrinsic rewards contingent on previously intrinsically motivating activity. While correct in their argument that previous research has had methodological flaws, Feingold and Mahoney have not corrected that methodology to eliminate alternative explanations for their own results. Clearly, the effects of contingent-expected rewards on intrinsic motivation have not been well-established. Methodological inadequacies and conflicts in theoretical interpretations similar to those discussed above may also be noted in the following presentation of research on the effects of noncontingent rewards. Noncontingent-expected Rewards In 1964, Weick offered college students extra course credit for participating in an experimental task. Half of the subjects, before beginning the task, were told they 565</page><page sequence="10">JOHN A. BATES would not receive the expected credits. On a posttask measure of interest, these denied subjects demonstrated a higher degree of task satisfaction than those subjects who had received credits. DeCharms (1968) has cited this study as evidence of changing levels of intrinsic motivation due to the effects of noncontingent-expected rewards. It must be pointed out, however, that Weick interpreted his results from the perspective of dissonance theory, which would predict that individuals will attempt to justify their participation in an unrewarded activity by reevaluating upward the desirability of that activity. Kruglanski, Friedman and Zeevi (1971) have considered this problem of conflicting interpretation (which is not unique to noncontingent rewards), and have argued in favor of self-perception theory as the most parsimonious explanation of the relation- ship between noncontingent task inducement and subsequent task enjoyment. In their 1971 research, Kruglanski et al. hypothesized a higher quality of task performance and motivation in the absence of noncontingent incentives. All subjects were volunteers between the ages of 15 and 16. They were presented with five tasks which included Zeigarnik measures, suggesting titles for a literary paragraph, com- posing a story from a list of vocabulary words, answering questions about a newspaper story, and recalling a list of nonsense syllables. Half of the subjects were told they would receive a reward (a tour of the Psychology Department of the Tel Aviv University) contingent only on task participation, and half were not. Those subjects who did not receive the noncontingent incentive spent significantly more time on- task, and expressed greater task interest and satisfaction than those who were promised the reward. That the experimental tasks used in this study were hardly of the variety normally considered intrinsically motivating is especially important to those concerned with the efficacy of classroom token economies. Since tokens are generally given to improve baseline performance (in tasks not likely to be engaged in independently), it may seem reasonable to question, on the basis of these results, whether extrinsic incentives may be the best means of eliciting a desired behavior. However, the possibility remains that the effects reported in this study were less a function of a reevaluation of the locus of causality, and more a function of the distractive qualities of the expected reward. In addition, although the results indicated a qualitative inferiority of responses for the rewarded subjects, the presence of extrinsic noncon- tingent incentive also resulted in "a tendency to perform the task in the shortest, fastest, most parsimonious way possible" (Kruglanski et al., 1971, p. 615). Finally, it is important to note that token economies do not generally reward participation in a task as an exclusive response topography. While some incentive may be necessary to initiate a behavior, continued reinforcement is usually made contingent upon reaching established performance criteria. The Kruglanski et al. research is representative of the literature on noncontingent rewards in that the only criterion for reinforcement was participation in the experimental task. This is, of course, the defining feature of noncontingent rewards and is not posed as a meth- odological inadequacy. However, the fact that this distinction exists between the body of research and the normal token paradigm severely limits the applicability of its results to the classroom token economy, although perhaps not to other classroom systems of reward. Lepper et al. (1973) performed a field study with preschool children to test the effects of noncontingent rewards from the perspective of the overjustification hy- 566</page><page sequence="11">REWARD AND MOTIVATION pothesis. Children who demonstrated high intrinsic interest in a drawing activity during baseline observations in their classrooms were selected as subjects for the experiment. These subjects were blocked by degree of initial interest in the activity and assigned randomly to one of three treatment conditions: expected reward, unexpected reward, and no reward. Rewards consisted of a gold star and red ribbon attached to a card labeled "Good Player Award." The experimental task involved asking the children already observed to have a high interest in drawing to draw pictures (individually and in private) for the experimenter. The experimenters noted a qualitative inferiority in the pictures drawn by the expected-reward subjects as opposed to the pictures of the other groups. Further, posttreatment measures of normal classroom drawing activity demonstrated decreased interest for those subjects who had received a noncontingent-expected reward in the experimental session. Subjects in the other two conditions demonstrated no change in their level of activity. Lepper and Greene (1975) replicated the earlier Lepper et al. (1973) research with a slightly different procedure. In addition to the expected-unexpected reward con- ditions, this study included surveillance-nonsurveillance via television monitor as independent variables. Subjects were 80 randomly selected preschool children. The experimental task involved solving a set of simple plastic puzzles, and the rewards were free play with one of several attractive toys. Despite these methodological variations, the results paralleled those of the earlier study: subjects in the expected- reward condition completed their target task slightly more quickly than did members of the other groups, but showed less interest in puzzle-solving after treatment than did subjects in the unexpected-reward condition; subjects under surveillance showed less posttreatment task interest than did subjects not under surveillance. These results were judged to be confirmation of the overjustification hypothesis. Lepper et al. (1973) were careful to point out that their data do not "suggest that contracting to engage in an activity will always or even usually result in a decrement in intrinsic interest in the activity" (p. 136). Although others (Levine &amp; Fasnacht, 1974) have interpreted the Lepper et al. (1973) and Lepper and Greene (1975) studies as contraindicative to token economies, the researchers themselves have made a distinction between the general token-economy paradigm and their own methodol- ogy. Specifically, token economies are instituted when the level of initial intrinsic interest in an activity is very low, or when the activity is one whose attractiveness becomes apparent only through engaging in it to some minimal levels of mastery. In their 1973 study, Lepper et al. chose subjects who had already demonstrated high interest in the activity on a behavioral measure. Thus, any system of reward may prove to be an unwise strategem for students already possessing high motivation for task participation if reinforcement is dispensed noncontingent with performance. In response to criticism that the one-trial reinforcement procedure common to overjustification research is not analogous to the multiple-trial token paradigm (cf., Feingold &amp; Mahoney, 1975; Reiss &amp; Sushinsky, 1975), Greene, Sternberg, and Lepper (1976) designed a test of their hypothesis within a more typical token- economy environment. Their study took place in an elementary school which emphasized an individualized mathematics program. Normal procedures of this program included a "math lab" and a weekly "Awards Assembly" for dispensing extrinsic rewards, such as certificates and trophies, to deserving students. Forty-four fourth- and fifth-grade students were selected as subjects on the basis 567</page><page sequence="12">JOHN A. BATES of the amount of time each had spent within the math lab over a 13-day period working on four new mathematics activities which had been introduced by the experimenters. Subjects were blocked into 11 groups of four, according to the extent to which they had concentrated on their two most preferred activities. From these blocks, subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: (1) differentially reinforced for engaging in either of a subject's two most preferred activities; (2) differentially reinforced for engaging in either of the subject's two least- preferred activities; (3) differentially reinforced for engaging in either of two activities selected by each subject on the basis of individual preference; and (4) nondifferen- tially reinforced for engaging in any of the four activities. Reinforcement consisted of one credit toward receiving an award at the Awards Assembly for every 3 hours (cumulative) spent on the target tasks during math lab. The reinforcement procedure continued for 12 days. Withdrawal began with an announcement that credits could no longer be given (because it was thought to be unfair to other students), but that the children were still encouraged to use the activities during their laboratory sessions. Withdrawal continued for 13 days. In order to demonstrate a reinforcement effect, baseline, treatment, and withdrawal phases were compared within each of the three differentially reinforced groups. In all cases, time spent on target tasks increased during treatment and decreased during withdrawal. The mean time spent on-task during withdrawal was then compared with the time spent during baseline, within each group. Further, these withdrawal data were compared with time spent by nondifferentially reinforced subjects on tasks matched according to level of preference expressed during baseline. For example, the time spent by subjects in the high-interest experimental group during withdrawal was compared with the time spent by nondifferentially reinforced subjects on tasks for which they had demonstrated the greatest preference during baseline. The time spent by low-interest subjects was compared with time spent by controls on their least preferred tasks. Time spent by choice subjects was compared with time spent by controls on activities with the same rank of preference as established during baseline. In all three differentially reinforced groups, time spent on-task during withdrawal was less than time spent during baseline (although the difference in the low-interest group was not significant, probably due to a floor effect). Also, except for those who were in the high-interest group, differentially reinforced subjects spent less time on- task during withdrawal than their nondifferentially reinforced counterparts. These results were interpreted by Greene et al. (1976) to demonstrate an overjustification effect within the context of a multiple-trial, token-economy paradigm. They suggested that the inconsistency observed in the high-interest/control comparison was more a function of methodological than theoretical inadequacy. While the results of this study appear to be strong evidence that a multiple-trial, token economy may produce a decrease in intrinsic motivation, it is important to recall the distinction made earlier between contingent and noncontingent rewards. Greene et al. have made continuous reference in this study to the contingent nature of their reinforcement. Nevertheless, the only criterion for dispensing rewards was time spent with the target tasks. Thus, their results offer no clear indication of the phenomenological similarity between decreases in intrinsic motivation due to rein- forcement for task participation and reinforcement for meeting some performance criterion, assuming that such a similarity indeed exists. 568</page><page sequence="13">REWARD AND MOTIVATION Deci (1972a) has reported an additional study within the same general paradigm as his previous research on contingent rewards, but including several additional variables and with results conflicting with the Lepper et al. (1973) research. Subjects were confronted with the Soma puzzle, and placed in one of six conditions: (1) threatened with punishment for poor performance; (2) given positive verbal feedback about their performance; (3) given negative verbal feedback about their performance; (4) rewarded with money contingent on participation; (5) rewarded with money contingent on performance; or, (6) given no reinforcement of any kind. The results suggested that rewards contingent on performance, threats of punishment, and negative verbal feedback all decreased subsequent intrinsic motivation, and that positive verbal feedback increased intrinsic motivation, as measured by time spent engaging in the puzzle-solving activity in a free-choice mode. However, rewards contingent on participation (i.e., noncontingent rewards) had no effect on subsequent behavior. This study is subject to the same methodological flaws already mentioned for previous Deci studies (1971, 1972b). Nevertheless, it raises an interesting question concerning the relative effects of contingent and noncontingent rewards. Calder and Staw (1975a) have taken issue with Deci's conclusion that noncontingent rewards do not change intrinsic motivation because subjects are less likely to perceive themselves as motivated by the rewards. Specifically, they have argued that Deci's results merely affirmed the null hypothesis, and that, since one can never know what factor accounts for a lack of change, it is impossible to prove the absence of an effect. They have asked whether "the receipt of noncontingent rewards in this experiment was the same as receiving no treatment at all, or were there other variables which caused the subjects' intrinsic motivation to remain intact" (p. 78). Calder and Staw (1975b) have delineated two major problems in accounting for a behavior in terms of intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. First, labeling a behavior as intrinsically motivating begs the question of the nature of the process through which the behavior has become motivating. Second, the methodology currently used leaves open the possibility that alternative explanations may describe the results equally well. Through their critique of Deci's research, Calder and Staw developed an experi- mental technique to test the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation by manipulating both intrinsic and extrinsic factors as independent variables and measuring their effects on task satisfaction and task persistence. They hypothesized an inverse (self-perception) effect when a task initially high in intrinsic motivation was paired with a noncontingent, monetary reward. That is, subjects would perceive the noncontingent reward to be the locus of causality for their behavior and would express dissatisfaction with the task. In contrast, Calder and Staw predicted a direct (reinforcement) effect when the rewarded task was not interesting. In this case, subjecLs would derive satisfaction from the normally uninteresting task due to the reinforcing quality of the reward. Subjects in this study were college students, and their task consisted of solving 15 jigsaw-type puzzles. Intrinsic motivation was manipulated by giving half the subjects blank puzzles, while the other half received puzzles that formed interesting pictures. All puzzles were very simple five-piece arrangements to minimize the effects of differing puzzle-solving abilities. Half of each group (n = 20) of subjects completed the series of puzzles for no pay, while the other half received one dollar on completion 569</page><page sequence="14">JOHN A. BATES of the task. The monetary reward was verbally and visually pointed out to the paid subjects before the experimental session to insure expectancy. After task completion, all subjects were asked to evaluate the task on a 17-point scale ranging from "extremely unenjoyable" to "extremely enjoyable." In addition, as a behavioral measure, subjects were asked to volunteer for future experiments of a similar nature, but for no reward. The results indicated a significant interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Paid subjects given the blank puzzles (extrinsic reward + low intrinsic motivation) rated the task higher and volunteered more often than unpaid subjects given the same puzzles. Conversely, paid subjects given the picture puzzles (extrinsic reward + high intrinsic motivation) rated the task lower and volunteered less often than unpaid subjects given the same puzzles. Moreover, the picture puzzles were actually rated as less enjoyable than the blank puzzles with the introduction of the noncontingent, monetary reward. Although the methodology used to generate these results is not consistent with the token-economy paradigm (i.e., single-trial, noncontingent reward with no demon- stration of a reinforcement effect), the observed interaction between reward and motivation is of more than theoretical importance. It suggests that a reattribution of the locus of causality for behavior (within the confines of noncontingent reward) is dependent at least in part on the nature of the task for which reward is offered. This relationship may be applied to any number of classroom reward systems to evaluate their potential effects on subsequent behavior. The results of research investigating the effects of noncontingent rewards seem nearly as contradictory as those reviewed for contingent rewards. However, it is becoming clear that a careful delineation of task-reward parameters is fundamental to understanding their relationship to intrinsic motivation. Further evidence for this is offered in the following section. Task-inherent Rewards Kruglanski, Riter, Amitai, Margolin, Shabtai, and Zaksh (1975) have investigated another of the conditions for interaction between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic rewards: the "content-consequence" hypothesis. They have suggested that whenever a tangible reinforcer is inherent to a task, its presence should enhance intrinsic motivation. In contrast, if a tangible.reinforcer is not normally associated with a task, its introduction may decrease task satisfaction. To test this hypothesis, Kruglanski et al. (1975) first presented 48 boys (14- to 15- years old) with one of two games. The first was a coin-toss guessing game, the other, a block-building game. Half of the subjects in each group received money contingent on performance in their game, and half received no money. Since winning money was judged to be more commonly associated with the coin-toss game than with the block-building game, Kruglanski et al. predicted higher intrinsic motivation for the former group of paid subjects than for the latter group. The results supported this prediction. Subjects in the money-intrinsic condition rated their task as more enjoyable and expressed a greater likelihood to reengage in the task when they were paid than when they were not paid. Subjects in the money- extrinsic condition rated their task higher when no monetary reward was offered. A similar experiment with 15- and 16-year-old subjects using other games (stock market transactions and athletic games) provided similar results. 570</page><page sequence="15">REWARD AND MOTIVATION In contrast to Deci's (1971, 1972a, 1972b) interpretation of the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors, Kruglanski et al. (1975) have demonstrated that extrinsic rewards may enhance intrinsic motivation if they are perceived to be inherent to the task content. Unfortunately, no measure was made of the quality of performance for the subjects in these studies. Without such data, we are unsure of the implications for those classroom systems of contingent reward wherein rewards may not be normally regarded as intrinsic to task performance. Should noninherent, contingent-extrinsic rewards prove to be both quantitatively and qualitatively inferior to inherent contingent rewards, a major reevaluation of such reward systems would be necessitated. It would follow that any activity could best be motivated (in terms of qualitative performance and resistance to extinction) by creating situations wherein participation in the activity could be causally attributed to the activity's content rather than its consequences. Unexpected Rewards The results of two studies involving unexpected rewards have already been discussed (Lepper &amp; Greene, 1975; Lepper et al., 1973). It may be recalled that both studies suggested that unexpected rewards had no effect on subsequent intrinsic motivation. Greene and Lepper (1974) have demonstrated a similar lack of effect. However, Kruglanski, Alon, and Lewis (1972) offer conflicting results. In their study, Kruglanski et al. (1972) introduced a series of five games ("follow- the-leader," "word construction," "song-matching," "discover-the-rhyme," and "speed writing") into the activities of four fifth-grade classrooms. Each class was randomly divided into two groups which competed between themselves on the games. No mention was made of any reward for the winning team. At the end of the competition, prizes were given to the members of the winning teams in two randomly selected classrooms. Immediately following the reward, and again 1 week later, the subjects were asked to evaluate their enjoyment of the activities. Subjects in the prize condition rated the tasks as less enjoyable than subjects in the no-prize condition in both evaluations. Kruglanski et al. attributed this decline in intrinsic motivation to a perception by the subjects that the competition engaged in was of the sort that normally would yield a reward. The presentation of a reward, even though unex- pected, maintained that perception, and the reward was further perceived as the causal agent for behavior. Kruglanski et al. (1972) have argued that their results may apply to any system which makes salient rewards a normal product of behavior. If rewards come to be expected (as they would, for example, in a token economy), their presence may inhibit intrinsic motivation. In fact, this rationale may explain why the Lepper et al. (1973) and Lepper and Greene (1975) studies failed to demonstrate a decrease in intrinsic motivation due to unexpected rewards. The tasks (drawing and puzzle- solving) in which their subjects engaged were not of the sort that normally yield salient rewards. However, too little research in the area of unexpected rewards has been reviewed to provide a compelling generalization to real-world systems of reward. Social Reinforcers Proponents of applied behavior analysis have often argued in favor of restricting reinforcers to those which may be more natural to the client's environment, in order 571</page><page sequence="16">JOHN A. BATES to maximize the likelihood of generalization and maintenance of behavior (e.g., Ferster, 1971; O'Leary &amp; Drabman, 1971). Social reinforcers, such as verbal approval, seem to fit the model of natural reinforcers. Three studies have been reviewed which attempt to place the effects of social reinforcers within the schema of intrinsic motivation. Deci (1971) hypothesized that the effects of social reinforcers (in this case, praise) may not be phenomenologically different from the inherent satisfaction derived from the successful completion of a task, and thus should act to increase intrinsic motivation. To test this hypothesis, Deci replicated the methodology of his original puzzle-solving research, with the exception that praise, rather than money, was the experimental reward. The results indicated a marginally significant difference (.10 level) between praised and unpraised subjects on free-choice time spent with the target task. Deci interpreted these results as supportive of the predicted increase in intrinsic motivation due to verbal reinforcement. It may be recalled that, in his attempt to demonstrate the compatibility of self- perception and inequity theories, Deci (1972b) again made use of verbal reinforce- ment, crossed with the presence or absence of monetary rewards. The experimental task was again puzzle-solving. Although Deci expected a positive effect from praising subjects' performances, only male subjects showed an increase in intrinsic motivation as a function of verbal reinforcement. Female subjects given verbal reinforcement demonstrated no significant change in motivation. Deci hypothesized this to be the case because the experimenter was a male who may have had enough positive interaction with the female subjects before the treatment phase to negate the effects of verbal reinforcement. Research by Eisenberger (1970) and by Paris and Cairns (1972) lend support to Deci's interpretation of this lack of effect for social approval. Eisenberger demon- strated a deprivation-satiation function for verbal reinforcement in line with these results. Paris and Cairns have suggested that verbal reinforcement is inferior to verbal punishment in promoting learning due to the contextual ambiguity and high fre- quency of verbal reinforcement in general conversation. A further study by Deci (1972a) used both positive and negative verbal feedback as consequences of puzzle-solving. It has already been noted that, in this study, positive verbal feedback increased intrinsic motivation, while negative verbal feed- back decreased intrinsic motivation. These results, combined with those of the previous two studies, suggest that social reinforcers may be beneficial to intrinsic motivation, provided that their presentation be unambiguously related to task performance. A Summary of the Evidence The methodologies of the studies reviewed above have often differed widely, and each has suffered from one or more inadequacies. Research that has consistently been interpreted to suggest the harmful effects of token economies on intrinsic motivation has seldom paralleled the token paradigm. In fact, few researchers have demonstrated that their rewards were actually reinforcing target behaviors. Also, aside from Feingold and Mahoney (1975), Greene et al. (1976), and Kruglanski et al. (1972), little effort has been made to investigate the long-term effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. Even in these cases, "long-term" was limited to 1- or 2-week investigations. 572</page><page sequence="17">REWARD AND MOTIVATION Methodological inadequacies notwithstanding, an overview of this body of research reveals a few relatively consistent findings that may, given further corroboration, have potential applications to the classroom. First, when rewards have been made contingent only on participation in an activity, this has generally led to a decreased interest in that activity, especially if it was, in itself, an entertaining or stimulating enterprise. Although, as has been noted, there is little evidence to indicate the longevity of this apparent decrease in task attractiveness, it may nevertheless be reasonable to doubt the wisdom in the common practice of dispensing certificates or trophies for mere membership in school-sponsored organizations. The single piece of research investigating an intentionally low-interest activity (e.g., Calder &amp; Staw, 1975b) has indicated that participation-contingent rewards may, initially at least, increase task interest. However, because this study did not include measures of subsequent subject performance on or interest in the task after rewards had been withdrawn, its value as a source of guidelines for educational practices is severely limited. A classroom example may best illustrate this issue. Elementary school children are offered some salient reward for time spent practicing the multiplication tables. Since this activity may generally be regarded as low interest, the reward may enhance task desirability. If the children were to evaluate their interest in the task immediately after receiving their rewards, they would (as a generalization from the Calder and Staw (1975b) results) rate it higher than if they had not been rewarded. However, this knowledge is of no value in predicting attitudes toward multiplication when rewards are no longer available. Any intrinsic-motivation research paradigm that does not supply the information necessary to make this extrapolation fails as a source of evidence for or against systems of reward. Another general finding has been that social reinforcers may contribute to intrinsic motivation if they are salient to the task at hand, and if their presentation is both unambiguous and of a low enough frequency to prevent satiation. Some evidence suggests that these and other more natural reinforcers are probably of greatest value when the task to be rewarded is one not normally associated with a tangible reinforcer. Generalization from the reviewed research to classroom reward systems based on performance criteria, including token economies, is extremely tenuous. In cases where task performance is already closely associated with extrinsic rewards, the absence of appropriate reinforcers would appear to be more damaging to intrinsic motivation than their presence. Whether the inverse may be true for tasks not clearly associated with rewards is a hypothesis that has produced conflicting results (e.g., Deci, 1971, 1972a, 1972b; 1975, vs. Feingold &amp; Mahoney, 1975). Finally, if, as some research has suggested (Kruglanski et al., 1972, 1975), repeated pairings of an extrinsic reinforcer with a task lead to a condition wherein task and reward are perceived as inherently inseparable, then one might seriously question the use of such reinforcers in situations where long-term maintenance of behavior would be critical. Of course, no reputable behavior analyst prescribes a program where tangible reinforcers are withdrawn with no attempt made to gradually fade in the control of more natural reinforcers. However, this notion of task-inherent rewards may, in part, explain the great difficulty of achieving stable behavior maintenance and generalization that often plagues behavioral researchers (Kopel &amp; Arkowitz, 1975). If so, teachers who routinely dispense rewards for all manner of classroom 573</page><page sequence="18">JOHN A. BATES activities may be well-advised to look elsewhere for methods to enhance the learning motivation of their students. An attempt has been made to generalize some of the results of previous research to classroom systems of reward. Clearly, the contradictory results that have charac- terized studies of intrinsic motivation have limited the scope and precision of these generalizations. The fundamental problem that may account for this failure of a large body of educationally relevant research to generate consistent prescriptions for the classroom may be the reluctance of the researchers to agree on a common dependent measure of intrinsic motivation. Is this construct most appropriately defined as the relative proportion of time allotted to engaging in a variety of competing activities, the quality and quantity of task performance, the subjective appraisal of a task's esthetic or entertaining properties, or some combination of these and other potential variables? Perhaps the most reasonable course for researchers to take in the future would be to combine as many potential dependent measures as possible into any experimental consideration of intrinsic motivation. If results continue to indicate that slight changes in methodology dramatically influence performance or subjective judgments of task interest, and that different measures of the same variable respond differently to the same experimental treatments, then one may question both the practical value and the psychological validity of the construct intrinsic motivation, at least as it has been applied to the educational milieu. In those studies where researchers have uniformly defined intrinsic motivation as freely choosing to engage in an activity in the absence of perceived, salient, extrinsic rewards, results have typically indicated a detrimental reward effect. Even in these cases, it may be reasonable to doubt the ecological validity of such results. In a very real sense, the experimental environments that have characterized most of the reviewed research should not be equated with the classroom, since the former describe one-way experimenter-subject reactions, while the latter involves a complex teacher-student interaction. However, although introducing rewards into a simulated classroom situation may provide greater insight into reward effects, manipulating rewards in an actual classroom may not be advisable. The results of prior research indicate that certain systems of reward may yield inferior performance and/or decreased interest when paired with certain tasks. Also, there is some evidence that these effects may influence future behavior in the absence of rewards. To replicate these results with children and academically oriented activities would be ethically unjustifiable. If, as Greene et al. (1976) have suggested, variations in procedure may in fact determine whether subjects ever think about the reasons for engaging in activities (p. 1,231), then future research must delineate these parameters. The notion of dispensing a reward to elicit or enhance a desired behavior pervades the American educational system. Whether that reward exists within a token economy, an Honors Assembly, or some more informal classroom procedure, it affects both initial and subsequent behavior. In what direction, to what extent, and for how long a time are the questions that must be answered before the ultimate desirability of any reward system may be finally determined.
