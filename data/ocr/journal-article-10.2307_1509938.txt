Paulsen Brigham Young University The view that God is incorporeal, without body or parts, has been the hallmark of Christian orthodoxy, but in the beginning it was not so. In this article I show that ordinary Christians for at least the first three centuries of the current era commonly (and perhaps generally) believed God to be corporeal. The belief was abandoned (and then only gradually) as Neoplatonism became more and more entrenched as the dominant world view of Christian thinkers.1 The evidence for my thesis is mostly indirect and circumstantial, but, considered cumulatively, it may prove to be quite convincing. Herein I emphasize evidence derived from two of the most uncompromising incorporealists, Origen and St. Augustine. Given their strong antipathies to corporealism, their testimony is particularly persuasive. THE GOD OF THE BIBLE That the very earliest Christians widely believed God to be corporeal is admitted by the noted church historian, Adolph Harnack, though he buries this admission in two footnotes in his seven-volume work, The History of Dogma. Of first-century believers, he writes: God was naturally conceived and represented as corporeal by uncultured Christians, though not by these alone, as the later controversies prove IFor a historical study of the introduction of Platonism into early Christian thought and its subsequent entrenchment as the dominant world view of Christian thinkers, see Robert P.

In the case of the cultured, the idea of a corporeality of God may be traced back to Stoic influences; in the case of the uncultured, popular ideas co-operated with the sayings of the Old Testament literally under- stood, and the impression of the Apocalyptic images.2 And Harnack further concedes, in the second century. . . realistic eschatological ideas no doubt con- tinued to foster in wide circles the popular idea that God had a form and a kind of corporeal existence.3 Harnack identifies several sources of early Christian belief in an embod- ied deity, including popular religious ideas, Stoic metaphysics, and Old Testament sayings, literally understood. It is well known that ordinary persons (including the early Greeks4 as well as early "uncultured" Chris- tians) have always (as Harnack suggests) naturally conceived God (or the gods) to be embodied. Further, Christians influenced by Stoic views reached the same conclusion on metaphysical grounds; from the Stoic belief that only matter was real, it followed that God was a material (and hence cor- poreal) being. But no doubt the biblical writings contributed most signifi- cantly to early Christian corporealism; for therein God is described in decidedly anthropomorphic terms.S For example, Cherbonnier shows that the God of biblical revelation, as contrasted with the deity of Neoplatonist metaphysics, is personal, invisible de facto not de jure, everlasting not timeless, ethically constant not metaphysically immutable; indeed, in many respects, God has more in common with the gods of the Greek and Roman pantheon than with Plato's "Being" or Aristotle's "Unmoved Mover."6 More 2Adolph Harnack, History of Dogma (7 vols.; New York: Dover, 1961) 1. 180 n. 1. 3Ibid., 2. 255 n. 5. 4Gilbert Murray, Five Stages of Greek Religion (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1955) 9- 10.

Professor Marmorstein points out that the issue of divine embodi- ment was vigorously debated by opposing rabbinic schools during the early centuries of the current era. Those who interpreted the scriptures literally understood God to be corporeal. Hellenized Jews, on the other hand, followed Philo's lead in attempting to purge the Old Testament of its anthropomorphic and anthropopathic ideas by means of allegorical exegesis. 6See E. LaB.

PAULSEN 107 to the point, many biblical passages (New Testament as well as Old) specifically indicate or imply that God is embodied.7 It is only after divine corporeality is rejected on philosophical (Neoplatonist) grounds that these passages are given figurative or allegorical interpretations.8 ORIGEN (185-253 CE) Substantial evidence that many (if not most) second- and third-century Christians believed God to be corporeal is found in the writings of Origen, a Hellenistic Christian philosopher, born in Egypt, probably Alexandria, about 185 CE.9 As noted, his testimony has great weight because of his vigorous opposition to corporealist teaching. All told, directly or indirectly, Origen supports my thesis in at least six ways. First, in his most important theological work, De principiis (On First Principles), Origen enumerates the doctrines that he says were delivered to the church by the apostles. Significantly, he does not include the doctrine of divine incorporeality in the list.l° 187. Cherbonnier provides a clear description of the anthropomorphic God of the biblical record, particularly as contrasted with later mystical/Neoplatonist views of deity. 7To mention a few, consider Genl:26-27; 5:1; 9:6 (God creates man in his own image and likeness); Gen 32:30 (I have seen God face to face); Exod 34:10 (they saw the God of Israel, there was under his feet. . .); Exod 33:11 (the Lord spake unto Moses, face to face); Exod 33:23 (thou shalt see my back parts; but my face shall not); Acts 7:56 (Stephen sees the Son of man standing on the right hand of God); Phil 2:6 (our vile body. . . fashioned like unto his glorious body). Cherbonnier acknowledges, of course, that there is considerable variety in scripture, including some passages that apparently reject an overly simple anthropomor- phism e.g., Hos 11:9, "For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst." However, he points out that standard proof texts such as these do not indicate that the later prophets abandoned anthropomorphism. Rather, he claims, that modern scholarship, "by restoring these passages to their context and so recovering their orginal meaning, reverses such an interpretation." Ibid., 188. XThough the philosophic critique of popular anthropomorphic conceptions of deity has its roots in ancient Greece, Philo Judaeus (20 BCE-40 CE), a Jewish Platonist educated in Alexandria, appears to be the first to apply allegorical interpretations to the anthropomorphic and corporealist passages in the Old Testament. Albinus, a second-century non-Christian and Middle Platonist, followed Philo's lead and, in turn, greatly influenced Origen and patristic thinkers. For an insightful examination of the reasons why the later church fathers rejected the primitive view of a corporeal deity see Grace Jantzen, "Theological Tradition and Divine Incorporeality," God's World, God's Body (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1984) 21- 35. 9See Joseph Wilson Trig, Origen: The Bible and Philosophy in the Third-Century Church (Atlanta, GA: John Knox, 1983). l°Origen, De principiis, in Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., The Ante-Nicene Fathers: Translations of the Writings of the Fathers down to A.D. 325 ( 10 vols.; Grand Rapids,</page><page sequence="4">108 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Second, Origen enlightens us on first- and second-century word usage, ignorance of which has contributed to misunderstanding of some biblical and other early texts. For example, Origen points out that nowhere in the Bible is God explicitly described as incorporeal. The Greek term for incor- porealzsomatos does not appear there. And even where the term does appear in early nonscriptural Christian writings, it does not have the same meaning, Origen tells us, that Greek and Gentile philosophers assign to it.1l Rather, Christian writers use the term to refer to a material body that is just much finer and less palpable than those perceivable through the senses. For example, he explains that in the treatise called The Doctrine of Peter where the resurrected Jesus is quoted as saying to his disciples, "I am not an incorporeal demon," this must be understood to mean that He had not such a body as demons have, which is naturally fine, and thin as if formed of air (and for this reason is either considered or called by many incorporeal), but that He had a solid and palpable body. Now, according to human custom, everything which is not of that nature is called by the simple or ignorant incorporeal; as if one were to say that the air which we breathe was incorporeal, because it is not a body of such a nature as can be grasped and held, or can offer resistance to pressure.l2 Among the early Christian writers who described God as asomatos, Origen was the first, with the possible exception of Clement of Alexandria, to use the term consistently in its technical Greek sense.13 In doing so, Origen followed the lead of second-century, non-Christian Middle-Platonists such as Albinus.14 More unexpectedly, Origen informs us that the New Testament passage John 4:24 (;;God is a spirit") the proof text now most frequently cited in support of the doctrine of incorporeality was initially understood by some as evidence against it. Thus, Origen writes: MI: Eerdmans, 1951) 4. 240-41. l IOrigen undoubtedly has reference here to "Greek and Gentile philosophers" of Neoplatonist persuasion who believed the spirit to be immaterial. As already noted, Stoics believed what- ever exists to be material and, thus, corporeal. Origen, De principiis, 241.

PAULSEN 109 I know that some will attempt to say that, even according to the declarations of our own Scriptures, God is a body, because. . . they find it said. . . in the Gospel according to John, that'God is a Spirit, and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.'. . . Spirit according to them [is] to be regarded as nothing else than a body.15 [Emphasis added] This surprising statement is explained by the facts that (1) pneuma (translated "spirit") literally meant "air" or "breath," thus implying that spirit is both material and corporeal; and (2) as already noted, for Christian Stoics, since existence was confined to material bodies, God, being a spirit, was only the purest of all bodies.16 Third, Origen explicitly acknowledges that at the time he wrote (about the middle of the third century CE) the issue of God's corporeality had yet to be settled in the church. He says that "how God himself is to be un- derstood whether as corporeal, and formed according to some shape, or of a different nature from bodies" is "a point which is not clearly indicated in our teachings." He thus proposes to make the issue a matter of rational investigation with a view to formulating a "connected series and body of truths. . . [or] one body of doctrine, by means of illustrations and argu- ments-either those. . . discovered in Holy Scripture, or. . . deduced by c;losely tracing out the consequences and following a correct method.''l7 Fourth, Origen engages in sustained polemics against those who affirmed God's corporeality. His argument is two-pronged: (1) he tries to show that corporeality is logically incompatible with Platonist conceptions of the di- vine nature, and (2) most important for my thesis, he labors throughout his writings to show his fellow Christians, by means of painstaking exegesis and allegorical interpretation, that the scriptures, notwithstanding their lit- eral import, do not disprove divine incorporeality. 18 It is instructive to consider some instances of the latter kind of argument in that they indicate the popular Christian understanding of the scriptures that Origen was in- veighing against.

Though Origen does not explicitly identify his opponents, Stroumsa says "they are, obviously, Christians (quoniam inueniunt scriptum esse apud Moysen)" (p. 346).</page><page sequence="6">110 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In De principiis, Origen argues that the scriptural passages that describe God as spirit, light, fire, etc. which, literally understood, would indicate God to be corporeal, should be understood metaphorically. 19 In his Homilies On Genesis, Origen argues that Gen 1:26, properly interpreted, does not show God to be corporeal. We do not understand, however, this man indeed whom Scripture says was made "according to the image of God" to be corporeal. For the form of the body does not contain the image of God, nor is the coxporeal man said to be "made," but "formed," as is written in the words that follow. For the text says: "And God formed man," that is fashioned, "from the slime of the earth." But it is our inner man, invisible, incorporeal, incorruptible, and im- mortal which is made "according to the image of God." For it is in such qualities as these that the image of God is more correctly under- stood. But if anyone suppose that this man who is made "according to the image and likeness of God" is made of flesh, he will appear to represent God himself as made of flesh and in human form. It is most clearly impious to think this about God.20 Origen makes light of a corporealist interpretation of Gen 1:26 by show- ing the absurdity that results from interpreting other passages the same way. Thus, he continues: In brief, those carnal men who have no understanding of the meaning of divinity suppose, if they read anywhere in the Scriptures of God that "heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool," that God has so large a body that they think he sits in heaven and stretches out his feet to the earth. But they think this because they do not have those ears which can worthily hear the words of God about God which are related by the Scripture.2l In Homily IIl, Origen acknowledges that "the Jews indeed,22 but also some of our people, supposed that God should be understood as a man, that is, 190rigen, De principiis, 24245. 20Ronald E. Heine, trans., Origen: Homilies On Genesis and Exodus (FC 71; Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1981) 63-64. 21Ibid. 22For an interesting discussion of the significance of anthropomorphic and corporealist conceptions of God in Jewish or rabbinic thought, see Gedaliahu G.

PAULSEN lll adorned with human members and human appearance" because in many scriptural passages God is described as speaking to people. But since "the philosophers despise these stories as fabulous and formed in the likeness of poetic fictions" (emphasis added), Origen attempts to show how God can speak to people without a mouth and a tongue and the other members with which the function of speaking is performed: But in this manner God is said to have spoken to man; he either inspires the heart of each of the saints or causes the sound of a voice to reach his ears. So also when he makes known that what each one says or does is known to him the Scriptures says that he "has heard"; and when he makes known that we have done something unjust, it says that he "is angry"; when he censures us as ungrateful for his benefits, it says he "repents," making known indeed these things by these dispositions which are common to men, but not performing them by these members which belong to corporeal nature. For that sub- stance is simple and is composed neither of any members nor of bodily structures and dispositions. But whatever is done by divine powers is either cited by the name of human members or is announced by dis- positions that are common and known, so that men can understand. And in this way God is said either to be angry or to hear or speak.23 Origen suggests that just as human voice can be understood as air that has been struck or made to reverberate by the tongue, so the voice of God might be understood as air that has been made to reverberate by the will of God. However, God often communicates his word to prophets without the sound of a voice. In this case the mind of the prophet that has been illuminated by the Spirit is directed to words. Fifth, Origen specifically includes the learned Melito as among the prominent second-century Christians who taught that God is embodied. Melito was active during the imperial reigns of Antoninus Pius (138-161) and Marcus Aurelius (161-180); he was probably dead by 197. Apparently, he spent some of his earlier life in Syria, having been made bishop of Sardis in Lydia in about 168 or 169. At this time, he was active as a Quartodeciman in the controversy concerning Easter.24 Melito was a prolific writer, composing some eighteen to twenty works. Of these, only five or six are definitely known to us, and these mostly in 230rigen, Homilies on Genesis and Exodus, 89-91. 24Richard C. White, trans., Melito of Sardis, Sermon "On the Passover" (Lexington, KY: Lexington Theological Seminary Library, 1976) 4-6.</page><page sequence="8">112 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW fragments.25 In the extant fragments, there is no affirmation of divine cor- poreality. That he taught the doctrine is reasonably believed on the basis of Origen's testimony recorded about fifty years after Melito's death. In his Selecta in Genesim, Origen explicitly identifies Melito as among the Christians who taught that God has a body in form like humans.26 Eusebius includes in his enumeration of Melito's works a book entitled (The Dis- course) on the Corporeality of God.27 Some have suggested that Origen was mistaken in attributing a corporealist view to Melito, claiming that he had no other basis for this attribution than a very weak inference from the title of the aforesaid treatise, which might be alternatively rendered as "The Discourse on God Incarnate." Thus, one commentator, while admitting that "it is not at all impossible that a writer as orthodox as Melito. . . held the opinions which Origen imputes to him," nonetheless questions Origen's claim: Here occurs the doubt: Had Origen himself read the treatise of Melito, or did he know nothing but the title, and rashly jump to the conclusion that Melito held views akin to those which he was at the moment combating? If Melito be the author of the Syriac apology no fault can be found with the spirituality of his conceptions of God. It does not seem possible now absolutely to determine the question. We are our- selves inclined to believe that Origen made a mistake, and that the subject of Melito's treatise was the Incarnation.28 Such speculation appears to be without warrant. Given Origen's erudition and his vigorous efforts to disabuse his fellow Christians of their corporealism, it seems totally incongruous that he, without having read Melito's book and without any further evidence, would have attributed this view to a respected bishop of the church. Moreover, Origen's testimony is further corroborated by Gennadius who, writing in the fifth century, affirms that Melito was responsible for a sect of Christians who followed him in 25Stuart George Hall, ed., Melito of Sardis, On Pascha and Fragments, Texts and Translations, (Oxford: Clarendon, 1979). 26;;Prius discutiendum est ubi consistat illud, ad imaginem, in corpore, an in anima. Et in primis videamus, quibus utantur qui prius asserunt; e quorum numero est Melito, qui scripta reliquit, quibus asserit Deum corporeum esse." PG 12, col. 94. See also his Comm. in Rom. 1.19, PG 14, col. 870-71, where Origen continues his polemics against Christian anthropomorphites: ;;qui in Ecclesia positi imaginem corpoream hominis, Dei esse imaginem dicunt." 27See Eusebius, Ecclesiastical Alistory, book 4, chap. 26. 28See ;;Melito," DCB (London: John Murray, 1882) 898.</page><page sequence="9">DAVID L. PAULSEN 113 the belief that the bodies of humans are made in the image of God.29 Further, since the doctrine of divine incorporeality was eventually endorsed in the later creeds, the fact that Melito taught God's corporeality (as well as the fact that he also turned out to be "wrong" on the Quartodeciman issue) could help to explain the otherwise mysterious disappearance of the aforementioned work and other of his writings.30 Finally, it is Origen who has preserved for us the testimony of Celsus, a second-century Middle Platonist and non-Christian, who wrote a compre- hensive critique of Christianity about 178 CE entitled Alethes Logos (True Doctrine). The work was subsequently suppressed or destroyed, and we know it only through quotations in Origen's work Contra Celsum composed seventy years later. Celsus attempts to demonstrate the inadequacy of Christian teachings, especially their doctrine of God, by reference to typical assumptions of Platonist philosophical theology.31 According to Origen, Celsus argues "at length" against what Celsus understands to be the Christian belief that God "is corporeal by nature and has a body like the human form."32 In his rejoinder, Origen refrains from even quoting (let alone refuting) Celsus' anticorporeality arguments, ex- plaining that if Celsus invents out of his own head ideas which he heard from nobody, or, to grant that he heard them from somebody, notions which he derived from some simple and naive folk who do not know the meaning of the Bible, there is no need for us to concern ourselves with unnecessary argument.33 It is interesting to observe that in responding to Celsus a fellow Platonist whose objections to divine corporeality he shares Origen feigns ignorance of any Christians actually teaching the doctrine. But as already shown above, Origen elsewhere reckons the learned Melito among the Christian teachers of the doctrine and throughout his writings engages in sustained argument against his fellow Christians who do believe the doctrine. Thus it seems 29Gennadius, Liber ecclesiasticorum dogmatum, 4. 30Compare Stroumsa ("Forms of God," 270) who claims that the affirmation of Melito's anthropomorphism is unfounded, citing 0.

ST. AUGUSTINE (354-430 CE) In his Confessions,34 St. Augustine provides substantial evidence that belief in a corporeal deity was still commonly held at least in some Chris- tian quarters as late as the fourth century. Augustine was born at Thagaste in North Africa in 354. His mother, Monica, was a Christian. Evidently, Augustine understood that Christians believed God to be embodied be- cause, by his own admission, this doctrine for many years constituted an insurmountable stumbling block to his acceptance of the Christian faith. As a youth, he tells us, he was embarrassed by the doctrine and succumbed to the logic of those who wittingly maligned it. For. . . that which really is I knew not; and was, as it were through sharpness of wit, persuaded to assent to foolish deceivers, when they asked me:. . . 'is God bounded by a bodily shape, and has hairs and nails?'. . . At which, I in my ignorance, was much troubled, and, departing the truth, seemed to myself to be making towards it; because as yet. . . I knew not God to be a Spirit, not one who hath parts extended in length and breadth, or whose being was bulk.... And what that should be in us by which we were like to God, and might be rightly said to be after the image of God, I was altogether igno- rant.35 At first, unable to accept Christianity because of (what he took to be) its doctrine of a corporeal deity, Augustine was much attracted to the Manichaean sect. I despaired of finding the truth, from which they [the Manichees] had turned me aside, in Thy Church, O Lord. . . and it seemed to me very unseemly to believe Thee to have the shape of human flesh, and to be bounded by the bodily lineaments of our members.36 For when my mind endeavoured to recur to the Catholic faith, I was driven back, since that was not the Catholic faith, which I thought to 34Edward B. Pusey, trans., The Confessions of St. Augustine (New York: Random House, 1949). 35Ibid., 44. 36Ibid., 89.</page><page sequence="11">DAVID L. PAULSEN 115 be so. And I seemed to myself more reverential, if I believed. . . Thee, my God. . . [to be] unbounded. . . than if. . . I should imagine Thee to be bounded by the form of a human body....37 Eventually, Augustine's career as a teacher of rhetoric took him from his native Africa to Italy, first to Rome and then to Milan where, under the influence of Bishop Ambrose, he became acquainted with Latin translations of Platonist writings and with the possibility of God's being a purely "spiritual," i.e., totally immaterial, invisible and incorporeal being.38 Au- gustine accepted this view of God and, with his long-standing stumbling block to Christian doctrine now removed, he was converted to the faith in 386 and the following year, at age thirty-two, was finally baptized. In his newly found Neoplatonic reinterpretation of Christian doctrine, he exults: But when I understood withal that "man, created by Thee, after Thine own image," was not so understood by Thy spiritual sons. . . as though they believed and conceived of Thee as bounded by human shape... with joy I blushed at having so many years barked not against the Catholic faith, but against the fictions of carnal imaginations.... For Thou, Most High, and most near; most secret, and most present; Who hast not limbs some larger, some smaller, but art wholly every where and no where in space, art not of such corporeal shape.... Thy Catholic Church. . . I now discovered. . . not to teach that for which I had grievously censured her. So I was confounded, and converted; and I joyed, O my God, that the One Only Church. . . had no taste for infantine conceits; not, in her sound doctrine, maintained any tenet which should confine Thee, the Creator of all, in space, however great and large, yet bounded every where by the limits of a human form.39 [Emphasis added] From the foregoing passages, it is evident that in his youth and for many years thereafter Augustine understood Christians to believe that God is embodied. Of course, he may have been mistaken. But since his own mother was a Christian, it seems more likely that at the least the Christians with whom he was acquainted actually believed and taught that God was corpo- real. 37Ibid., 89-90. 38Stroumsa, "Incorporeality of God," 352. 39Augustine, Confessions, 99-100.</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 116 This conclusion need not rest solely on inference, because Augustine acknowledges that belief in God's corporeality was still found among contemporary Christians, whom he mocked for not being able or willing to interpret the Bible allegorically.40 THE DEMISE OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE Though replacement of the embodied God of the Bible with the incor- poreal deity of Neoplatonist metaphysics occasioned great relief for St. Augustine, it was traumatic for others. A case in point is seen in the distress this caused one fourth-century Egyptian monk, Abba Sarapion. John Cassian, in his Tenth Conference, reports that Sarapion believed God to be like a man since Adam was made in his image, and so pictured God as he prayed. When Photinus, a learned deacon from Cappadocia, visited the brethren, he was questioned about the meaning of the scriptural teaching that man was created in the image and likeness of God. He explained that in the East "all leaders of the churches" interpreted this phrase "spiritu- ally" ("non secundum humilem litterae sonnum, sed spiritualiter"). Sarapion was persuaded to give up his erroneous beliefs and devotional practices. Yet he felt devastated, when "the anthropomorphic image of the Godhead, which he used to set before him in prayer, was removed from his heart." In great despair, prostrating himself on the ground and weeping, he cried out, "they have taken my God from me, and I have now none to behold, and whom to worship and address I know not.''41 40Augustine, C. epist. fund. 23.25.
