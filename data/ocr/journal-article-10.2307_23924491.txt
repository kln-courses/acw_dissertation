<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 6, No. 2, June 1992 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE William F. Monroe To Take Up The Waste Land once again would seem a feckless if not a foolish attempt. 'So many,/... so many': was Eliot anticipating the superflu ity of critics? The impulse to persist comes in large part from the belief that the appropriation, dismemberment, and disposal of texts inadvertently accomplished by writing and scholarship is in fact a major source of the alienation and renunciation figured forth by Eliot's poem. We do well to take up again those central if unfortunately overworked texts and attempt, as best we can, to turn them back into poems and stories. The world needs more conversations, more 'coductions,' especially about this poem.1 That, at any rate, is one of the assumptions that makes possible this admittedly personal and confessional essay. The attempt, then, is not to say something new, something that no one has thought or said before, but to say again more or less familiar things about Eliot's poem, certainly one of our century's great gnostic myths. Despite the slipperiness of the term and the treacherousness of the gnostic terrain, I am encouraged by the fact that Eliot, though the darling of the new criticism, invites his readers to employ whatever languages may prove useful, even those not native, familiar, or intuitively sympathetic. In 'Reli gion and Literature' Eliot invites us to bring to The Waste Land not only our literary and aesthetic sensibilities and languages, but also our broader cultural affiliations and habits, our religious commitments and experiences, our social and political practices. 'The author of a work of imagination is trying to affect us wholly, as human beings, whether he knows it or not,' Eliot asserts, 'and we are affected by it, as human beings, whether we intend to be or not.'2 Thus Eliot sanctions a coductive and confessional criticism. Moreover, Eliot's own allusive, omnivorous poetics encourages us to respond in ways that the academy would describe as cross-cultural and interdisciplinary, and our responses are likely to be less precise, definite, and incontrovertible than if we limited ourselves to a consistent, homogenous, theoretical language. Consequently, even if some of my remarks about Eliot's gnostic impulse prove familiar, others may appear predatory, parochical, and wrongheaded. I will try to avoid offending not only Eliot scholars but also students of comparative religion and those feminist scholars who, like Elaine Pagels and Rosemary Radford Ruether, look to historical Gnosticism as a powerful Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">192 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE countervailing theology, a perennial religious impulse beneficially subvers ive of the masculine, monotheistic orthodoxies of the West.3 The gnostic axis inspiring and informing Eliot, however, is not the proto-feminist axis associated with Elizabeth Cady Stanton's revision of scripture and some of the work of Gertrude Stein as well as with Ruether and Pagels; it is, rather, a dualistic, esoteric tradition, what Pagels calls a 'gnostic world view—a philosophy of pessimism about the world combined with an attempt at self-transcendance.' (xxx)4 A sharp division between good and evil, spirit and flesh, a tradition of mystical apotheosis beyond the prison-house of stultifying conformity, and a history of antinomian attempts to 'exhaust the flesh' constitute a powerful legacy for modern writers, including Eliot. This pessimism-cum transcendance strategy can be found in The Waste Land by tracing the testimony of the Thunder and the final 'benediction' to their common source in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. And, while a gnostic spirit of asceticism predominates, Eliot's poem also evinces a strategy of exhausting the world and the flesh through antinomian license, an essential element of historical Gnosticism. The gnostic impulse is thus complex in its manifestations, and it has been explored, exalted, and contemned by such modern intellectuals as Hans Jonas, Paul Zweig, Eric Voegelin, Harold Bloom, and Ihab Hassan.5 Cleanth Brooks and John Desmond have demonstrated that Gnosticism can be used as a heuristic for explaining the strategies of literary characters and authors, and their essays serve as models for my effort here.6 Calvin Bedient's recent declaration in He Do the Police in Different Voices that 'insofar as Eliot is "Christian," he is Gnostically so, at least in The Waste Land,' has also encouraged me in what ten years ago seemed a somewhat fanciful approach to the poem. My intention is to trace, or retrace, what Bedient calls Eliot's 'blistered and blistering antihumanism' and explain how his disenchantment with civilization impelled him to seek a purifying, antinomian 'passage to India'.7 Whereas reform is presumably the satirist's nominal objective, worldly renewal or rebirth in any guise is seen as a delusion by the true Gnostic—or by the impermanent yet acute 'gnostic attitude' that we all sometimes adopt. For the poet who has had, as it were, a gnostic vision, the lyric impulse that follows, if it follows, is not best expressed by the prophet's shout of reformation and renewal but by the hermit's raspy whisper of alienation. The Gnostic Impulse as a Strategy of Alienation Patterns of gnostic desires, whether poems or cosmogonies, can be usefully understood as strategies of alienation from dominant cultures. At their best, strategies of alienation sensitize us to the presence of hierarchy and privilege</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM F. MONROE 193 in order to make us uncomfortable with repression and victimage. These strategies can also offer a sense of solace and superiority to authors and readers who cannot conscience or abide an affiliation with a world of senseless war, comfortable conformity, luxurious emptiness, and life-in death. Thus the greatest impetus for the cultivation of gnostic strategies in the twentieth century has been the uninhabitable nature of the twentieth century itself. But once we recognize these costs of civilization, of our identifications political and communal, how shall we respond? What strategies shall we employ in a world where congregation is forever joined to exploitation and oppression, where merely by walking, by working, we seem to 'tread on faces, on compulsive/thighs and knees,' as Eliot says in 'The Death of St. Narcissus'? Kenneth Burke reminds us that our culture is not by any means the first to engender remarkable and influential strategies of aliena tion. Perhaps all historical epochs have fostered intellectuals—and I am including 'poets' of every variety in this group—who have expressed estrangement from their cultures. For Eliot, this impulse eventually resolved itself in an exaltation of Lancelot Andrews and 'The Idea of a Christian Society,' a world of high culture that would foster classic works of art shaped by a refined, intellectual religion. But at the juncture of The Waste Land, the poet is, as Bedient observes, 'like the Hinayana Buddhist who goes apart from others to save his purity, as opposed to the Mahayana Buddhist who would establish a Pure Land for the many.' (218). Even the recluse who abandons the res publica must practice some social or 'corporate' identifications—even the hermit's role may be a social one. Their effort to avoid sociality per se led the Gnostics to cluster in small enclaves, often in the 'deserts' of the ancient world; and their corresponding effort to avoid corporate or group identifications led them to create alternat ive, otherworldly identifications of mystical self-regard. In practice, though, the Gnostic prophet could no more 'cure' his followers of their impulse to identify with shared corporate attitudes than can the modern psychoanalyst, who, according to Kenneth Burke, 'cure's his patient of a faulty identifica tion only insofar as he smuggles in an alternative identification.'8 'Smuggling in' an alternative, otherworldly identification, I believe, might well be accomplished by a poem. In their obsession to avoid impure identifications, some of the most conscientious and self-reflective people of Latinity abandoned the character istic Roman public life. Hans Jonas describes the Gnostic movement as the most potent of these renunciations, a diffuse yet comprehensive phenomenon that influenced many Greek and Jewish sects, as well as pre-Christian and early Christian religious thought. Central to all versions of historical Gnos ticism is a radical distinction between the material and the spiritual, between</page><page sequence="4">194 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE the world and God. Unlike orthodox Christianity, which retained a certain reverence for the human body and the fallen but divinely created world, the Gnostics denounced the mutable world, its laws, and its customs as utterly foreign to the 'knowing' among mankind. Eliot uses alien, other worldly prophets—Ezekial, Ecclesiastes, Augustine, the Buddha, Tiresias— and blends their voices into a gnostic lament, a chorus that proclaims our homelessness in a world of things and senses. Gnostic cosmogony ingeniously posits an unseeing and ignorant Demi urge as the creator of the corrupt and corrupting world. The possession of knowledge (gnosis) distinguishes the spiritual one from his environment and sanctions a 'privative mood': the Gnostic is the knowing one in the midst of the unknowing, the light in the midst of darkness, and he possesses a 'divine spark' or pneuma that guarantees his alienation. Just as the true God is alienated from the created universe, so the Gnostic pneuma is forever 'a foreign spark' in the quotidian world. Striking a similar chord, Eliot has Augustine, 'a representative of Western asceticism,' rejoice in his escape from Carthage and proclaim, 'O Lord Thou pluckest me out.' We under stand that Augustine is rejoicing in his escape not from a particular place or even from the lusts of the flesh per se, but rather from humanity itself— certainly his is a gnostic psalm. If the Gnostics' sense of alienation gave rise to their notions of an antiworldly God and pneuma, it also engendered a derisive attitude toward those human beings who seemed to belong and be at home in the world. If their cosmogony asserted a radical dualism between God and the Demi urge, their theology drew a sharp distinction between the saved and the damned. Centuries later, some Calvinistic Christians would see the earmarks of 'election' in worldly success; the Gnostics, conversely, cultivated their estrangement, for 'failure' in the world signified their superiority and their salvation. In the Buddha's 'Fire Sermon' he explains that 'the learned and noble' develop 'an aversion' for the eye, for the mind, for ideas, for everything outside the self, in fact. Eliot, composing his own 'Fire Sermon,' introduces Tiresias, whose blindness suggests an aversion for the eye. Tiresias is, in Eliot's words, 'the most important personage in the poem' specifically because he possesses a purer, higher consciousness. He is an anomaly and a worldly 'failure,' but Tiresias also represents the knowing one in the midst of the unknowing, the gnostic, we might say, amid the hylici, the wooden, spiritless denizens of this world. Perhaps The Waste Land's Gnostic analogues are merely coincidences. If we view historical Gnosticism as a compensatory spiritual strategy, however, a response to the flux and confusion of the late Roman Empire, then we would surely expect images, concepts, characters, and patterns classifiable as 'gnostic' to appear at other times in history as well, especially in our own</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM F. MONROE 195 incoherent, demythologized age of alienation. Gibbon, for example, bor rowed the imagery of the Gnostics to describe the Pax Romana. Its homo geneity, not unlike the conformism of our time, felt like a prison, Gibbon says, vast yet confining and airless. Indeed, prison imagery is ubiquitous in the Western intellectual tradition. Fredric Jameson uses it to discuss contem porary structuralism in The Prison-House of Language and thereby suggests some of the scandals of structuralist analysis: its emphasis on the synchronic at the expense of the diachronic, its inability as a system to account for linguistic and cultural change, and its 'arbitrary and absolute decision' to analyze reality in terms of linguistic systems.9 But Jameson also reminds us that it was Plato who composed the most famous and persistent story of the world as a prison-chamber: the Myth of the Cave in Book 7 of The Republic. In the cave or chamber, Socrates says, are 'men who have been prisoners there since they were children, their legs and necks being so fastened that they can only look straight ahead of them and cannot turn their heads.' They know nothing 'of themselves or their fellows save the shadows thrown by the fire upon the wall of the cave opposite.'10 The Myth of the Cave tells us that what we know with our culturally mediated tools of perception and analysis is not the ground of knowledge; what we experience is not reality itself, but something foisted on us by our collective linguistic system. Platonic metaphysics suggests that the best salvation comes to the few who have escaped the prison-house of culture. One could argue, in fact, that a gnostic impulse already within Platonism re-emerged a millenium later in the dualisms of the Neoplatonists. But these connections are only intuitive, schematic, and I resist making the claim that there was a historical borrowing between various dualistic traditions or a literal adaptation of gnosticism by Eliot. The use of 'prison' to describe the state of mankind by divergent sources in various socio historical epochs suggests, though, that a certain attitude toward the world—that it is an enormous confinement, a vast yet stifling corruption— is a recurrent strategic response to many different kinds of situations. Lionel Trilling notes the prevalence of the prison image in nineteenth-century literature and suggests that writers began 'to think of the prison not as a political instrument merely but as the ineluctable condition of life in society.' Wordsworth, Arnold, and Dickens, according to Trilling, anticipate Freud's view of the human mind as its own punitive confinement once the social impress transforms it into the matrix of civilization.11 The matrix of civilization, as Foucault has taught us, is but another means of oppression, another word for prison-house. The coercive force of culture, to which the alienated self is opposed, establishes 'its prisons in the family life, in the professions, in the image of respectability, in the ideas of faith and duty, in (so the poets said) the very language itself' (Trilling, p. xi). The sense that</page><page sequence="6">196 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE we are all trapped within the linguistic-symbolic or some other overarching system is a thought or 'belief' that is shared by theorists from Plato to Derrida. Eliot's famous description of The Waste Land as a 'wholly insigni ficant grouse against life' seems less self-effacing and more prophetic in this context. The poem is not a 'criticism of the contemporary world,' as social historians might hope, not a 'grouse' against the machine age, or the modern city, or contemporary morals, but against life itself. Freedom from life—— from one's culture, one's language, from one's own mind—this is the gnostic dream, and it is never far to seek in human experience. The Virtue of Damnation Writing immediately after the Great War, which seemed to many to signify the collapse of an entire culture, in Burke's words, 'too assertively, too hopelessly, itself,'12 Eliot may well have sensed a cultural or personal need for a gnostic transcendence of the world. At any rate, as a poet Eliot no doubt realized that 'affirmative' art, literary works that seem to uphold the dominant cultural values, do not 'work' very well at historical moments of alienation, of turmoil, or of enervating conformity—this is the modern writer's ubiquitous rhetorical problem. At such cultural moments, poems that uphold and preserve become deadening props of oppressing institutions and the status quo. A gnostic renunciation and transcendence, conversely, may very well awaken a powerful aesthetic and 'religious' response in readers who feel confined within an airless prison-house. Eliot's poem, I believe, awakens such a response. The Waste Land, even with its elaborate tissue of allusions and its dense verbal complexity, can still be read as a story of the alien poet or prophet searching—vainly—for whatever makes life worthwhile, call it meaning, in a meaningless world. 'The miseries that people suffer through their particular abnormalities of temperament are visible on the surface: the deeper design is that of the human misery and bondage which is universal.' Thus Eliot introduced Djuna Barnes's Nightwood, a book populated by outcasts, misfits, and aliens, but one that Eliot nonetheless praises as a tragedy of Everyman.13 We are all aliens, Eliot seems to say; but in The Waste Land, only some of us— perhaps the best of us—choose to become questers and wanderers, exiles from the 'Unreal' polities. Eliot's protagonist in this sophisticated and 'belated' poem, whatever his or her guise, is a wandering alien. In an essay published eight years after The Waste Land, Eliot praises Baudelaire for his sense of evil: 'he was at least able to understand', Eliot says, that the sexual act as evil is more dignified, less boring, than as the natural, 'life-giving,' cheery automatism of the modern world.14 This atti tude—that evil is better than 'cheery' conformity—is also evident in The Waste Land. In a moment I will try to demonstrate some parallels between</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM F. MONROE 197 ascetic Gnosticism and the Upanishads, those texts which seem to best explain the resolution of Eliot's poem. I want now to suggest an association between some themes in the body of The Waste Land and another, licentious strain of historical Gnosticism. Actually, the link between asceticism and libertine antinomianism makes sense: if the social, political, and material world is truly inferior, then to abide by its laws, its traditions, or its temporal justice is to align oneself with that impurity. While both the ascetic way and the licentious way countermand the claims of culture, a spirit of asceticism clearly predominates in The Waste Land. The questing figure (whether poet or knight or Fisher King) comes to the peace which passeth understanding by the path of self-denial as represented by the Buddha, by Augustine, and also by the chaste Grail Knight, Parsifal. It seems clear that the questing protagonist finds himself no longer a part of the world by the end of the poem. By the time he reaches the shore by the arid plain, he has been chastened, shriven, and insulated from the concerns of this world; like the 'intelligent Soul' of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad from which Eliot takes the testimony of the Thunder, 'He is not followed by good, he is not followed by evil, for then he has passed beyond all sorrows of the heart' (Brih., 4.3.22). Nonetheless, as Jonas reminds us, the ascetic repudiation of the world may be a mirror image of the libertine: both are lives outside the moral law. 'The one repudiates loyalty to nature through excess,'Jonas explains, 'the other through abstention.'15 Followers of Walker Percy will recognize this bifurcation of the moral life as 'angelism-bestialism.' In fact, several years after composing The Waste Land, Eliot admitted his dualistic tendencies in a letter to Paul Elmer More. 'I am one,' Eliot wrote to More, 'whom this sense of the void tends to drive towards asceticism or sensuality.' 'This sense of the void,' according to Lyndall Gordon, is Eliot's apprehension of the emptiness, the vacuity, 'in the middle of all human happiness and all human relations'.16 In The Waste Land, one of Eliot's many reminders of the void at the centre of human relations is the song of the nightingale. In the 'Unreal City,' the song is ugly and wasted, nothing more than "'JugJug" to dirty ears' (I.103). Or: Twit Twit Twit Jug jug jug jug jug jug So rudely forc'd Tereu (11. 202-205) The song of the nightingale has not always been sordid and debased, however; once the nightingale had sung with 'inviolable voice.' Philomel, according to Eliot's treatment of Ovid's story, was 'by the barbarous king/So rudely forced'</page><page sequence="8">198 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE (11.99—100), an act of violence and violation. Yet the rape of Philomel was responsible for the precious change, the woman's metamorphosis and the bird's beautiful song: yet there the nightingale Filled all the desert with inviolable voice And still she cried, and still the world pursues. (11. 100-102) A wantonly rapacious act, then, one that violates our sense of justice and would seem to demand punishment, is the sin qua non of the nightingale's 'inviolable voice.' In the modern waste land, the fate of Philomel may have degenerated into a grotesque ornament hung 'Above the antique mantel' (1. 97), possessed but unnoticed by the bored woman of leisure and luxury; but Eliot would have us feel that a certain grand and seductive pity has thereby been lost, and he associates the beauty of the nightingale's song with Ovid's retelling of this antinomian act, the morally reprehensible violation of Philomel. Eliot's treat ment here closely parallels the chilling but compelling claim of Robinson Jeffers in 'The Bloody Sire' that 'Violence has been the sire of all the world's values.' 'Who would remember Helen's face,' Jeffers asks, 'Lacking the terrible halo of spears?/Who formed Christ but Herod and Caesar?'17 Eliot's lines, I am claim ing, reflect a similar faith that violence is the bloody sire of beauty. 'The Fire Sermon,' as many have noted, parallels the ascetic renunciation by the Buddha and Augustine of the fleshly and material temptations of the world. Yet Eliot has in this section alluded to Andrew Marvell by using a line from 'To His Coy Mistress,' a line whose context indicates the banality of modern sexual relations: But at my back in a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. (11. 185-87, 195-98) Eliot's comparison by juxtaposition clearly favors the iconoclastic, erotic aban don of Marvell to the discreet, unguentary operations of Sweeney and Mrs Porter. If we follow Eliot's note, and examine To His Coy Mistress for contrasts as well as similarities, we discover that Marvell expresses a refined disregard for the mutable world and its moral laws, as if he would willingly destroy himself and his flesh-and-blood mistress in one final act of consummation and consumption. After hastily performing the requisite praise of his mistress' charms, the speaker is ready to get on with the satisfaction of his appetites. To this rapacity the imagery of the final stanza would seem to attest, with its</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM F. MONROE 199 'amorous birds of prey,' its pleasures torn 'with rough strife,' and its evocation of the act of love with the conceit of an assault on the 'iron gates of life' by a siege gun. By alluding to the carpe diem theme of Catullus through the mediation of Marvell's poem, Eliot inserts an element of licentious lust into the asceticism of 'The Fire Sermon.' To the same end Eliot implies the superiority of the Phoenician and Syrian merchants of the ancient world to the modern merchant, Mr. Eugenides. The 'Smyrna merchants]' in the past were purveyors of the great Phoenician fertility cults whereas the polite but 'demotic' Mr. Eugenides can only offer a businessman the bland sexual encounter of 'a weekend at the Metropole' (1. 214). Like Sweeney and Mrs. Porter, Mr. Eugenides participates in the habitual peccadillos and calculated misdemeanors that are the hallmarks of a meek, worldly existence. His name suggests that he descends from a noble race, the Phoenician fertility cults, but Eliot's treatment of 'Eu-genides' makes appar ent his inferiority to his ancestors. Eliot's fascination with the Phoenicians, underscored by the fact that the 'Phlebas' who dies 'by water' in Part IV is also a Phoenician, parallels his preference for Marvellian lust to the 'discreet indiscretions' of Sweeney and Mrs. Porter. But the licentious, cormorant quality in Marvell's poet is redoubled in the Phoenicians: they were worshippers of Baal, a Canaanite deity whose cults practiced holy prostitution and child sacrifice. According to moral traditions dominant in the West, even the debased sexuality represented by Mr. Eugenides, however vapid, would seem a lesser evil than the slaughter of innocents at the behest of a wanton fertility god. So it must have seemed to the Hebrew prophets, who represent for Eliot as they did for Matthew Arnold the idea of moral law. The Phoenician cults were so abhorrent to them that they probably amended the name of the Phoenician deity to form 'Baal-zebub' or 'Beelzebub,' an alternative name, of course, for 'Satan.' Yet these cults are clearly not abhorrent to Eliot. The rape of Philomela as depicted by Ovid, the lust of the courtier as expressed by Marvell, the cults of fertility as represented by the Phoenician sailors—these are exalted by Eliot, despite their association with violence and lawlessness. Or rather, it would be more precise to say that Eliot makes them comparatively attractive because their wanton intensity potentiates beauty and the kind of 'dignified,' that is, not boring, sexuality worthy of damnation. 'It is true to say that the glory of man is his capacity for salvation,' Eliot writes in 'Baudelaire'; 'it is also true to say that his glory is his capacity for damnation. The worst that can be said of most of our malefactors, from statesmen to thieves, is that they are not men enough to be damned' (236). It may not be unfair to recall Jeffers's antinomian assertion about a bird of prey: 'I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk.'18 The true Gnostic, as Jonas explains, will be forever at war with the world, and in fact the repudiation of objective responsibility and conventional morality is seen as 'the assertion of the authentic freedom of the self'. If the world is to be repudiated by being exhausted, if the gnostic impulse is to mortify the flesh by committing great evil, then the possibility of significant</page><page sequence="10">200 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE transgression, the capacity to sin, must be maintained. Some years after The Waste Land, Eliot laments the disappearance of cultural restraints and embraces a higher, more traditional culture. Such a conversion might have been anticip ated: traditional restraints provide a context for rebellion and 'damnation,' thus making plausible gnostic strategies of alienation. What the modern waste land lacks, Eliot seems to be saying, is the ability to 'sin mightily,' in the words of Luther. 'In all his humiliating traffic with other beings,' Eliot says in praise of Baudelaire, 'he walked secure in this high vocation, that he was capable of a damnation denied to the politicians and the newspaper editors of Paris' (236). Rather than Baudelaire, Eliot might well have been describing one of the two principal strategies of alienation utilized by the protagonist in The Waste Land. In the epigraph to 'The Hollow Men,' a poem obviously related thematically to The Waste Land, Eliot mourns the death of Kurtz, Conrad's Faustian over reacher. We recall that Kurtz's vision of modern civilization as 'The horror, the horror!' was to serve as the explanatory epigraph to The Waste Land before Pound insisted that Eliot change it. Simon Magus, the great Gnostic heretic, was also known by the name of Faustus, and he even claimed that his consort, Helena, was a descendent of Helen of Troy. Faust, the great 'overreacher' of our tradition, is often seen as the embodiment of man's urge for self-deification. And as Satre tells us in Being and Nothingness, the desire to be God is anything but a historical aberration: 'The best way to conceive of the fundamental project of human reality is to say that man is the being whose project is to be God.' It is other people who remind us that we are not God, that we must comprom ise, that coexistence requires polity, social arrangements, economic systems of transference and exchange. 'Hell,' one of Sartre's characters says in Huis Clos, 'ce sont les autres'. Eliot's poetic practice in The Waste Land, while infinitely more complex than in 'The Hollow Men,' exalts a Faustian or Baudelairean excess and suggests its superiority to the spiritless conformity of the modern world. Like the Upanishads that clearly influenced the poem, The Waste Land encompasses and celebrates libertine as well as ascetic patterns of conduct because both abnegate the prison-house of culture. The Upanishads and Gnosticism Many readers, seeking a more redemptive vision, point to the resolution of the poem, to the Upanishads, the Hindu scriptures, which seem to offer the protagonist, and by extention Eliot and the reader, a gesture and a tonality of repose: Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata. Shantih shantih shantih 'Give, Sympathize, Control'—the testimony of the Thunder, as Eliot's notes tell us, is derived from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad; 'Shantih' is a formal ending to an Upanishad, and is best translated: 'The peace which passeth understanding.' These cues from Eliot have been enough to convince many</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM F. MONROE 201 that Eliot holds out a hope for the reader at the very end of his poem: that rebirth is possible, that the modern waste land might finally be redeemed by the sacred words of Eastern scripture, especially when 'translated' into a benedic tion from The Book of Common Prayer. But the phrase is significantly elided— Eliot drops the reference to 'Jesus Christ'—and, given the nature of the experience that Eliot has brought us through, it is reasonable to question rather closely these 'good words,' to ask what kind of peace might still be possible, to ask, as Eliot did in 'Gerontion,' 'After such knowledge, what forgiveness?' The peace of 'What the Thunder Said,' I submit, derives from esoteric knowledge, and it 'passeth understanding' because it cannot be conceptually expressed. More importantly, it is not intended as 'useful knowledge'; it is not to be put into action or made to do work in the world. 'The word "Upani shad,'" as A. C. Bouquet explains in Sacred Books of the World, means 'secret or confidential teaching.'19 What the initiate eventually learns from the study of the Upanishads is vidya, or supreme mystical knowledge. By means of this knowledge he is raised above the world of the senses with its moral distinctions; through vidya he escapes the wheel of death and rebirth. Perhaps the most authoritative translator of the Upanishads, Robert E. Hume, confirms the importance of knowledge, as opposed to faith or works, in the Upanishadic ideas about salvation. 'Knowlege—not "much learning" but the understanding of metaphysical truths,' was, according to Hume, 'the impelling motive of the thinkers of the Upanishads.' (58) The nature of vidya, or mystical knowledge, varies somewhat within the Upanishads, but usually the knower is he who realizes that his soul is unified with the great Soul, Atman. Those initiates who seek the Atman are sometimes counseled to look into a mirror or pool of water to find him. 'That,' meaning Atman, 'art Thou'—this has become the most famous phrase of the Upanishads. For a Westerner like Eliot, the comparison to Narcissus would be inescapable. Vidya, then, might well admit equation with gnosis: not conscious or rational thought, not practical wisdom, but secret, ineffable, absolute, and self-regarding knowledge. According to Jonas, the possession of knowledge distinguishes the Gnostic from his environment and justifies his independence and repudiation of the world. In addition, it also signals the disappearance of the Hellenic concept of areté, virtue or excellence within the polity. The Gnostics, like many other adherents of transcendental religions, utterly rejected the Greek sense of virtue as a social or civic duty. The Gnostics found in their salvific knowledge an injunction to reject the world absolutely, and not only the world but the human body, the mind, and even the contaminated psyche or soul. The form that this rejection took was usually a self-abnegating asceticism, but as we have seen, it could also take the form of libertinism. An admonition to abandon or abnegate the social self and the political world can be discovered throughout the Upanishads. The practical way of knowing Brahma, the world-producer and controller, is by means of renunciation. The Brihadaranyaka gives Eliot 'Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.'; but there he would also have read that the knower of Brahma is 'He who passes beyond hunger</page><page sequence="12">202 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE and thirst, beyond sorrow and delusion, beyond old age and death.' The knower of Brahma is urged to 'become disgusted with learning'; he is to 'desire to live as a child. When he has become disgusted both with the state of childhood and with learning, then he becomes an ascetic (muni). When he has become disgusted both with the non-ascetic state and with the ascetic state, then he becomes a Brahman.'20 One becomes a Brahman, then, when the desire for children and wealth and worlds is extinguished, when both innocence and experience disgust one, and when everything other than the mystical, unearthly Soul is renounced. The emphasis on otherworldly knowledge, however, is not culturally domin ant, even in the land of the Upanishads. In From Ritual to Romance, Eliot would have read Weston's description of the Eastern 'Life-Cult': 'the sense of Life, the need for Life, the essential Sancitity of the Life-giving faculty,' she says, exercised an overpowering influence on primitive religions.21 Yet this Eastern 'Life-Cult' apparently did not capture or quicken Eliot's imagination; in fact, he creates a poem which serves as a counter-statement to the contemporary life-cults that he observed and could scarcely abide: 'OOOO that Shakespeher ian Rag—/It's so elegant/So intelligent' the speaker-protagonist sings, mocking the popular music of his time. Weston describes 'a strong opposition to [the Life] cult in Indian literature, beginning with the Rig-Veda, and ripening to fruition in the Upanishads' (45). This literary opposition, with its ties to Buddh ism and the Upanishads, clearly fascinated Eliot, and he articulates his rejection of the 'Life-Cult' and his allegiance to the myth of renunciation throughout the poem. The final Upanishadic benediction, far from offering hope for the world or humanity, opposes the 'essential vitality' of the 'Life-Cult' as common, popular, and sullied—not unlike the sexuality of the Thames daughters and the young man carbuncular. April, the Easter month of rebirth and life, belongs to the 'demotic' polity. Like the Buddha's renunciation of the world and the senses, the Brihadaranyaka clearly expresses an admonition that Eliot would have recognized as resembling Augustine's Neoplatonism or perhaps even Manichaeanism or Gnosticism. The one who is attached to this world, depreciated as a 'doer of deeds' in some of the Upanishads, is doomed to rebirth and reincarnation: Whatever he does in this world, He comes again from that world To this world of action. —So the man who desires. (Brih., 4.4.6) The one who eschews action in the world, however, can hope for freedom from this prison-house. 'He who is without desire may be "released" from the world and the painful cycle of rebirth. He who is freed from desire, "Being the very Brahma, he goes to Brahma/ ... Then a mortal becomes immortal!/ Therein he reaches Brahma!': That Thou art—Atman is Brahman. The equation obtains in historical Gnosticism as well: the soul or spark in the few was not</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM F. MONROE 203 merely a signal or reflection of the true Deity, but literally a fragment of God. As in Gnosticism, so in the Upanishads: with the rejection of the world of getting and spending comes an apotheosis of this contra-mundane, spiritual self. The Brihadaranyaka, in fact, urges the enlightened person to 'worship the Self alone as his world.' Eliot seems to have imitated the thematic pattern found in the Upanishads by contrasting his questing, gnostic protagonist with the secular 'dead'—the doers of deeds and the accountants of'profit and loss' in the 'Unreal City.' Indeed, the structure of the The Waste Land reflects the transference from the world of Becoming to the Nirvana of Being, an escape from the memory of 'the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell/And the profit and loss' to the undifferentiated, inviolable peace of'DA,' the cessation of the strenuous worldly quest in the gnostic quietude of 'Shantih Shantih Shantih.' The Waste Land, like the Gnostic prophecies, seems not to be seeking the end or alleviation of alienation, but rather working to intensify the estrangement of the audience. Eliot's note to line 308 ('Burning burning burning burning') directs the reader to the work of Henry Clarke Warren, who writes that 'the minds of the thousand priests became free from attachment and delivered from the depravit ies' while the Buddha delivered his Fire Sermon.22 Such a detachment seems to be the attitude pressed upon us by 'The Burial of the Dead,' 'The Fire Sermon,' and in fact by the entire poem. For the initiated reader, the reader who can, while contemplating the poem, give up his social identifications, there remains a kind of temporary redemption like that enjoyed by the thousand priests who attend to the Buddha's eloquent condemnation of the world. In conceiving an aversion for the created world, the world of the senses, the auditor/initiate becomes divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes free. Most importantly for us, 'he knows that rebirth is exhausted ... and that he is no more for this world' (Warren, 353). Thus the consideration of Eliot's final benediction and the testimony of the Thunder, both adapted from the Brihadaranyaka, leads us back to the heart of his poem, 'The Fire Sermon.' In his reading of the Upanishads, Eliot discovers attitudes sympathetic to his own and finds an ancient source of otherworldly teachings—just as Emerson had almost a century before. These sacred texts provide an authoritat ive, Eastern expression of aversion to fallen nature and debased culture, an aversion that also appears, though manifested variously, in historical Gnosticism, in Neoplatonism, and in other historical examples of theosophy and esoteric mysticism.23 The authority of alien prophets, the banality of modern sexuality, the futility of action within this worldly prison-house—these thematic elements can be combined with the final benediction in a reading of the poem as the elaboration of a gnostic impulse. At the beginning of The Waste Land we hear the sybil cry, 'I want to die'; and by the end of the poem, the end of the quest, a kind of death has been achieved. 'April', then, 'is the cruelest month' because it initiates yet another rebirth into this world of memory and desire. The final extinction of the memory of earthly discriminations and of human attachments,</page><page sequence="14">204 T. S. ELIOT'S GNOSTIC IMPULSE the Upanishads tell us, can only come in sushupti, dreamless sleep, or better still, through a death that brings release from samsara, the chain of births, deaths, and rebirths. This is the Nirvana of both Buddhism and Hinduism, the eternal, dreamless sleep sought by the sybil: a transcendence of the dessications and impurities of this world, a devoutly to be wished dissolution that signals the end of earthly rebirth and the final victory of the divine, alien spark. It may be worth noting that Augustine himself embraced two dualistic traditions, Manichaeism and Neoplatonism, before turning finally to orthodox Christianity. Eliot's celebrated conversion and his more orthodox poems come several years after his composition of The Waste Land. If the poem is, as I have argued, a lyric articulation of a gnostic impulse, a spiritual progression similar to Augustine's would seem to have been enacted in Eliot's own life. Whereas 'The Journey of the Magi' and the 'Four Quartets' may figure forth a specifically Christian sensibility, The Waste Land moves toward the Silence of the One, not the Incarnation of the Word manifested in the abundance of the world. The Vatican's 1989 letter on 'Some Aspects of Christian Meditation' makes these distinctions quite clearly: the divine is always revealed to the Christian 'through the human-earthly dimension.' The Christian is asked to renounce 'personal selfishness,' but not 'those created things which he has given us and among which he has placed us.'24 Orthodoxy asserts that God, not an evil Demiurge, has placed us among created, earthly things. But one need not resort to the orthodoxy of Rome and Cardinal Ratzinger for a clear Gnostic-Christian distinction. Sallie McFague, representing contemporary feminist theology, sug gests that the necessary 'otherness' of God is manifest and present to the Christian through a 'worldly transcendence'.25 Incarnational theology retains the fleshliness, what the Gnostics would call the woodenness, of God. Indeed, the Renaissance often emphasized Christ's humanity by depicting him as an infant with prominent, naturalistic genitalia or nursing at the bared breast of his mother.26 Even Ruether, who suggests that we look to Gnosticism for a 'usable,' feminist theology, regrets its dualistic depreciation of nature, embodi ment, and creation as a whole (Sexism and God-Talk, 21—36). We should not be misled by the words of the Thunder or the Upanishadic benediction. The poem's redemptive promise, if there is such a promise, is a gnostic salvation clearly distinguishable from an exemplary Christian life. And yet the poem speaks, and continues to do so, to 'us,' calling us—to what? Calling us to join, I would say, a special coterie of knowing ones who look for a world perfected through art and religion, or want no part of it at all. The Waste Land is a great gnostic myth that by its very artifice and effectiveness compromises its would-be thematic and ethical purity. By using rhetorical appeals to shape the experiences of culture-bound readers, the poet implicates himself in the worldly prison-house that his poem so eloquently renounces. Nonetheless, Eliot continually and overtly alienates himself from his audience, slipping in and out of recognizable personae, interrupting, dislocating, fragmenting, and 'doing' disembodied voices. We can admire Eliot's range and omnivorous 'translations' without valuing his hermeticism, what George Steiner</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM F. MONROE 205 would call his technical difficulty. At best the poet celebrates an exclusively high culture manifesting the power of the true God and his true followers to achieve vidya and leave the demotic world behind. It is a religious poem that does not rejoice in God's Plenty; it is a purifying ritual that does not cleanse society. The Waste Land 'smuggles in' a wholly divine rather than a communal identification: one self's purgation of the impurities imposed on it by the mundane and the many. Eliot's gnostic impulse, as Bedient asserts, leads him to 'the less indulgently anthropomorphic theology of the East' (42)—leads him, we might say, not to incarnation but to gnosis, not to liturgical song but to private chant, not to Isaiah's 'For unto us a child is born' but to the Brihadaran yaka's 'Shantih Shantih Shantih'.
