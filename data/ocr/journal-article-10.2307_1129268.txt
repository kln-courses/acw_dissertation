Schwartz University of Pittsburgh SCHWARTz, RicHARD G. Presuppositions and Children's Metalinguistic Judgments: Concepts of Life and the Awareness of Animacy Restrictions. CGan DEVELOPMENTr, 1980, 51, 364-371. The relationship between children's concepts of life and their judgments and revisions of sen- tences with violations of animacy restrictions was examined. Based on their responses to a ques- tionnaire, each of 40 children (4-2 to 8-10) was classified as belonging to 1 of 4 groups repre- senting different concepts of life. Their concepts differed in the types of inanimate and animate objects to which they attributed life and the criteria that they employed. A task involving judg- ments and conversions of 10 well-formed sentences and 30 anomalous sentences with animnacy re- striction violations was administered. Each of 3 anomalous-sentences types involved a class of subject noun referents that could have been considered alive by at least 1 of the groups, based on their questionnaire responses. Examinations of the children's judgments and revisions of these sentences revealed a close relationship between the children's presuppositions concerning the concept of life and their metalinguistic judgments. The findings suggest that such judgments are based on or made relative to relevant conceptions of the world. Children's abilities to judge the semantic and syntactic well formedness of various sen- tences and provide appropriate revisions con- sistently lag behind their productive mastery of the semantic and syntactic aspects of those sentences (James &amp; Miller 1973; Villiers &amp; Vil- liers 1972, 1974). The later emergence of such metalinguistic abilities has been attributed pri- marily to factors involving linguistic develop- ment. It has been proposed that as development proceeds, children may develop an increased awareness of certain specific linguistic rules, such as those governing lexical restrictions (James &amp; Miller 1973). Alternately, it has been suggested that this apparent lag in develop- ment may simply be indicative of asymmetries in the development of different linguistic per- formances (Villiers &amp; Villiers 1974). However, an important aspect of such judgments has been overlooked in explaining the development of this metalinguistic ability. Lakoff (1971) has argued that, for many sentences, it is not sensible to examine judg- ments of well formedness in isolation. Instead, some sentences may only be considered well formed or anomalous as they relate to a given set of presuppositions. Lakoff provided the fol- lowing example: "My cat, who believes that I'm a fool, enjoys tormenting me" (1971, p. 332). Speakers who have had experience with what Lakoff termed "cunning felines" would find the sentence to be well formed relative to their beliefs about the mental abilities of cats. Speakers who do not hold such beliefs concern- ing feline mental abilities would find the sen- tence to be anomalous. Metalinguistic judg- ments and revisions solicited from children may similarly reflect certain of their relevant con- ceptions of the world. Specifically, children's judgments of sentences involving violations of animacy restrictions should bear a close rela- tionship to their beliefs concerning the animacy of the referents involved and to their overall I wish to express my appreciation to the staff and children of the Memphis State University Campus School and the Parkway Village Educare Center, and to M.

For example, a child who believes that rocks are alive might judge the sentence "The thirsty rock rolls down the hill" to be well formed, while a child who does not believe rocks to be alive would judge the sen- tence to be anomalous. Animistic thinking, that is, the tendency to attribute life to inanimate objects, and the developmental changes in children's criteria for attributing life to objects (Laurendeau &amp; Pin- ard 1962; Piaget 1929) suggest certain predic- tions of children's performances in judging and revising certain anomalous sentences. Based on children's responses to a standard question- naire, Laurendeau and Pinard found that chil- dren could be classified into four groups (stages 0, 1, 2, and 3) according to their developing concepts of "life" (animism) .1 The bases for these classifications were children's judgments of the animacy of both animate and inanimate objects, the reasons they gave for their judg- ments, and their stated definitions of life. With some alteration of the definitions pro- vided by Laurendeau and Pinard to permit greater separability of the groups, the following predictions emerge. Group 0 children random- ly attribute life to a variety of inanimate ob- jects. They would be expected to be insensitive to violations of animacy restrictions (i.e., would judge sentences with such violations to be well formed or fail to appropriately revise them) regardless of the characteristics of the subject- noun referents of the sentences. Children in group 1 attribute life to all moving objects but not to static objects. These children consequently would be expected to be insensitive to animacy restriction violations in sentences with subject-noun referents classi- fied as exhibiting autonomous or nonautono- mous movement. They should, however, be sensitive to (i.e., consider anomalous) viola- tions occurring in sentences having static sub- ject-noun referents. Group 2 children attribute life only to those objects which exhibit autonomous move- ment. Given this belief, they would be ex- pected to be insensitive to violations only in those sentences with subject-noun referents that exhibit autonomous movement. Sentences involving static or nonautonomously moving subject-noun referents with violations cf anima- cy restrictions should be judged anomalous by these children. Group 3 represents the total disappearance of animistic thinking; life is attributed only to animals or plants. These children should be sensitive to violations of animacy restrictions regardless of the characteristics of the subject- noun referents involved. Given anomalous sentences differing in the characteristics of the inanimate subject nouns (autonomous, nonautonomous, static), one can also predict the relative sensitivity of the chil- dren in the different groups for each sentence type. For sentences with subject-noun referents exhibiting autonomous movement, it would be expected that only children in group 3, who do not attribute life to such objects, would be sensitive to violations. Children who attribute life to such objects (groups 0, 1, and 2) would be expected to be equally insensitive to viola- tions in such sentences. Only children in group 0 should be insensitive to violations of animacy restrictions in sentences with static subject-noun referents. Children who do not attribute life to such objects (groups 1, 2, and 3) should be equally sensitive to violations in such sentences. Group 2 and group 3 children, who do not at- tribute life to objects exhibiting nonautonomous movement, should be equally sensitive to vio- lations in sentences with such objects as sub- ject-noun referents. Children who attribute life to such objects, groups 0 and 1, should be equally insensitive to violations in these sen- tences. If Lakoff was correct in proposing such a close relationship between presuppositions and judgments of well formedness, such beliefs should influence children's metalinguistic judg- ments and revisions in the fashion mentioned above. It should be noted, however, that two other outcomes are also possible, The children might be more generally sensitive to animacy restriction violations than their questionnaire responses would suggest. In this case it might then be concluded that conceptions of animacy relevant to such judgments develop before a 1 Although Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) characterized these groups as "stages" and maintained that the development of the concept of life occurs in a series of stages, the term "group" has been substituted throughout this paper. Given the recent arguments which have been raised concerning the stage hypothesis (Brainerd 1973b), it appears questionable that this particular development actually occurs in separable sequential stages. Therefore the adap- tations of Laurendeau and Pinard's criteria for stages were employed as a means by which children could be classified into four groups, each representing a different pattern of perfor- mance on the questionnaire on life.</page><page sequence="3">366 Child Development child is able to express them in response to a questionnaire. A somewhat less plausible con- clusion might be that judgments and revisions are based exclusively on linguistic rules govern- ing the co-occurrence of words within sentences or probabilistic information about the co-oc- currence of words. To examine further the rela- tionship between conceptions of animacy and sentence judgments it would then be necessary to assess these conceptions nonlinguistically. Alternately, the children might be less sen- sitive to violations than their questionnaire re- sponses would suggest. Such a finding might lead to the conclusion that in addition to the conceptual underpinnings for metalinguistic judgments, a child must be aware of the spe- cific linguistic rules governing the co-occurrence of certain words. The purpose of the present investigation was an examination of the specific relationship between children's stated presup- positions concerning the concept of life and their judgments and revisions of sentences with violations of animacy restrictions. Method Subjects Forty children (18 males and 22 females), ranging in age from 4-2 to 8-10, with a mean age of 6-5, served as subjects. Included in this sample were seven 4-year-olds, six 5-year-olds, 15 6-year-olds, eight 7-year-olds, and four 8- year-olds. The children were drawn from an elementary school and a day-care center, both of which serve a predominantly middle-class area. The educational levels of these children ranged from preschool through third grade. None of the children who served as subjects had been identified as exhibiting any speech, language, or other developmental disabilities, or hearing difficulties. Stimuli Two tasks were involved in this investi- gation: (a) a questionnaire on life adapted from Laurendeau and Pinard (1962), which served as the basis for grouping the children according to their attained concept of life; and (b) a sentence-judgment task involving sen- tences with and without violations of animacy restrictions. Questionnaire.-The questionnaire on life involved both general and specific questions. The general questions were, "Do you know what it means to be alive, to be living? What does it mean? Give me the names of some things that are alive" (Laurendeau &amp; Pinard 1962, p. 265). The specific questions concerned 21 different animate and inanimate objects (e.g., a mountain, the sun, a pencil, a snake) and involved questions of the form "Is alive? Why do you say it is [not] alive?" (p. 265). These two questions were asked for each of the 21 objects. Experimental sentences.-The sentence- judgment task was comprised of 40 sentences: 10 were well formed and 30 were anomalous. Each sentence was in the form, Article + Ad- jective + Noun + Verb + Preposition + Arti- cle + Noun. The anomalous sentences involved only inanimate subject-noun referents, while the well-formed sentences involved animate as well as inanimate subject-noun referents. Three groups of 10 anomalous sentences differing in the characteristics of their inanimate subject-noun referents were constructed. Sen- tences of the first group, sentence type A (au- tonomous), contained subject nouns which could be characterized as exhibiting autono- mous movement, such as wind or clouds (e.g., "The hot sun runs across the sky"; "The thirsty cloud covers up the sun"). The subject nouns in the second group of sentences, sentence type B (static), had as referents objects which could be characterized as not typically exhibiting movement, such as mountains or walls (e.g., "The pretty lamp sleeps in the corner"; "The hungry bed is in the room"). The sentences in the third group, sentence type C (nonautono- mous), had subject-noun referents which could be characterized as exhibiting nonautonomous movement (i.e., objects requiring obvious agents) such as a car or chalk (e.g., "The new car looks at the light"; "The sad chalk falls on the floor"). Half of the sentences within each sentence type contained subject-verb vio- lations as in the first sentence of each pair of examples above. The remaining half of the sen- tences within each type contained adjective- noun violations as portrayed in the latter ex- amples in each of the pairs above. It should also be noted that 12 of the subject nouns in- cluded in the anomalous sentences corresponded to items in the specific question portion of the questionnaire on life. The children were not made aware of this correspondence. The remaining 10 sentences were well formed by adult standards. Four of these sen- tences had animate subject-noun referents such as fish or cat (e.g., "The big fish swims in the water"; "The scared cat runs in the house"). The remaining sentences contained inanimate subject-noun referents corresponding to the three different types of referents involved in the anomalous sentences (e.g., cloud, bed, and</page><page sequence="4">Richard G. Schwartz 367 pen). These well-formed sentences served pri- marily as a basis for comparison of the chil- dren's abilities to provide judgments for such sentences. They also were included as a guard against the possibility of response sets within the judgment task. To insure that the anomalous sentences were appropriately classified as anomalous and that the well-formed sentences were appropri- ately classified as well formed, 10 graduate stu- dents in speech pathology at the University of Pittsburgh were asked to judge the well formed- ness of the sentences and revise any they con- sidered to be anomalous. Their judgments, when compared with the original classifications on a sentence-by-sentence basis, revealed an agreement of 100%. Procedure Task administration.-Each child was ad- ministered the questionnaire on life and the sentence-judgment task during a single individ- ual session. The order of presentation of these two tasks was counterbalanced across subjects. For the questionnaire on life, the general pro- cedure of Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) was employed. In cases where a child either did not answer or gave an incomplete answer, the question was simply repeated or rephrased so as not to alter its content. With the aforemen- tioned exceptions, all children were adminis- tered the same questionnaire. Questions were randomized into two orders and presentation was counterbalanced across subjects. Items within the judgment task were ran- domized into two orders, tape-recorded for presentation, and presented in counterbalanced order across subjects. The children were in- structed that some of the things they would hear would sound "silly" and some of the things they would hear would sound "OK." They were instructed to tell the experimenter whether each sentence sounded "silly" or "OK." The children were further instructed to tell the experimenter how to make the "silly" sentences sound "OK" and the "OK" sentences sound "silly." Five trial sentences were then presented, three of which were anomalous and two of which were well formed. These sentences were designed to draw attention to subject-verb and adjective-noun violations (e.g., "The black cat barks in the house"; "The purple grass is in the yard"). In cases where a child exhibited some initial dif- ficulty, the judgments and revisions of the first two sentences were demonstrated by the ex- perimenter. None of the children was excluded because of inability to perform the task. Scoring.-First the children were classified as belonging to one of the four developmental groups representing different concepts of life. There were 10 children in each of these groups. The criteria for classification were adapted from Laurendeau and Pinard. Specifically, chil- dren classified as group 0 gave responses to the questionnaire which indicated that they at- tributed life to a variety of inanimate objects on the basis of unstated or inconsistent cri- teria. Objects which are typically static (e.g., mountain), nonautonomous in their movement (e.g., bicycle), and apparently autonomous in their movement (e.g., sun) were all labeled "alive" by these children. Group 1 children em- ployed movement as their primary criterion for judging objects to be alive. Things that ex- hibited any kind of movement (autonomous or nonautonomous) were considered to be alive, while any object that was typically static was not considered to be alive. Children in group 2 all made some differentiation between au- tonomous movement, for which a causal agent cannot be identified, and nonautonomous move- ment, for which there is an obvious causal agent. In employing movement as a criterion, these children attributed life only to those ob- jects which exhibit autonomous movement. In isolated instances children in groups 1 and 2 stated criteria of anthropomorphism and use- fulness in attributing life to inanimate objects. The children in group 3 did not attribute life to any inanimate objects included in the ques- tionnaire, although in some instances they in- dicated that they did not consider plants to be alive. This group represented the disappearance of animistic thinking. The reliability of the classifications of the children into these groups, when compared with those of a second judge for half of the subjects, was found to be 100%. A score for each sentence as well as a total score for each of the three anomalous- sentence types was derived for each child. Each well-formed sentence correctly judged "OK" was assigned a score of 1, and each well-formed sentence incorrectly judged "silly" was assigned a score of 0. Children received a score of 1 for each anomalous sentence which was correctly adjudged "silly" and was corrected in such a way as to eliminate its animacy restriction vio- lation. A score of 0 was assigned if the child correctly identified a sentence as "silly" but either maintained the selectional violation in the correction or provided a correction which bore no relevance to the original sentence. In cases where the child incorrectly judged an</page><page sequence="5">368 Child Development anomalous sentence to be "OK," a score of 0 was assigned. It has been argued that judgments alone are the most appropriate criteria for cognitive tasks such as those involving conservation (Brainerd 1973a, 1974, 1977). The scoring system employed in this investigation was adopted in spite of these arguments for the following reasons. Unlike conservation tasks, tasks involving metalinguistic judgments allow the possibility of alternate hypotheses (Villiers &amp; Villiers 1974). Children may judge a sen- tence (e.g., "The grey rock walks up the hill") to be anomalous for a variety of reasons other than the violation of animacy restrictions (e.g., "Rocks can only walk down hills"; The rock is black not grey"). The only means to insure that the child's judgment is based on the violation and not an alternate hypothesis is to consider the child's revision of sentences judged to be anomalous. Additionally, since the focus of the investigation was on the relationship between the children's performances on the sentence- judgment task and their responses to the ques- tionnaire, it was necessary to make the tasks as comparable as possible. Because classifica- tions based on the questionnaire involved both judgments and explanations, it seemed appro- priate to take judgments and revisions into ac- count in scoring the sentence task. Agreements between the children's judg- ments of anomalous sentences with subject nouns corresponding to items on the question- naire and their responses to those items were also scored. A score of 1 was assigned in each case where there was apparent agreement, and a score of 0 was assigned in each case where there was apparent disagreement. For example, an agreement occurred in a case where a child labeled an inanimate object as alive and had a score of 0 on the corresponding sentence; thus a score of 1 was assigned. Results Well-formed Sentences A one-way analysis of variance revealed no differences between the children in the different groups in their performances on the well-formed sentences, F(3,36) = 1.38, p &gt; .05. Thus, re- gardless of their concept of life, the children were all able to provide similarly accurate judg- ments for the well-formed sentences used in this investigation. Anomalous Sentences A mixed-model analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to examine the children's performance on the anomalous sen- tences. Groups served as the between-subjects variable; anomalous-sentence types served as the within-subjects variable. Significant main effects were revealed, indicating differences be- tween the groups, F(3,36) = 53.79, p &lt; .001, and differences between anomalous-sentence types, F(2,72) = 60.45, p &lt; .001. Additional- ly, a significant group x sentence-type interac- tion was found, F (6,72) = 8.57, p &lt; .001. The hypothesized relationship between concepts of life held by the different groups and the anomalous sentence types generated two sets of specific predictions concerning the children's performance. The first set concerned the performances of the children in the dif- ferent groups within each sentence type. The second set concerned the performances of the children within each group across the sentence types. These predictions were evaluated by means of a posteriori Student Newman-Keuls procedures. Summaries of these predictions and results are presented in table 1. All reported differences were significant at the .05 level. Cell means are presented in table 2. Sentence types.-For sentence type A (au- tonomous), the results indicated that the group 3 children, who did not consider such objects to be alive, provided a greater number of ac- curate judgments and revisions than children in groups 0, 1, and 2, who considered such ob- jects to be alive. There were no significant dif- ferences in the performances of the children in these latter three groups. Children in groups 1, 2, and 3, who did not attribute life to static objects, were significantly more accurate in their judgments and revisions of type B (static) sen- tences than were children in group 0, who did attribute life to such objects. There were no differences between the scores on this sentence type for children in groups 1, 2, and 3. On sentence type C (nonautonomous) the scores for the children who did not consider such ob- jects as animate, groups 2 and 3, were signifi- cantly higher than those for the children who considered nonautonomously moving objects to be alive, groups 0 and 1. Children in groups 2 and 3 did not differ in the number of accurate judgments and revisions which they provided for these sentences. Contrary to expectations, however, group 1 children performed better than group 0 children. In order to determine whether chronologi- cal age contributed significantly to the differ- ences noted above, or whether these differences were predicted by concept of life, stepwise multiple regression analyses were employed.</page><page sequence="6">Richard G.

These analyses involved the use of dummy variables to represent the different concept of life-based groups. The F tests applied to the derived regression coefficients revealed that in no case was age a significant predictor of the children's performances on the various anoma- lous sentence types. Chronological age was found to be correlated with the children's per- formances on each of the sentence types. How- ever, the regression analyses revealed that their concepts of life, not their chronological ages, were significant predictors of the children's per- formances on the anomalous-sentence types. Group performances.-The second set of predictions and a posteriori analyses addressed the relative performances of the children within each group across the three sentence types (see table 1). The group 0 children, who attributed life to a variety of inanimate objects on the basis of unstated or inconsistent criteria, per- formed similarly across the three sentence types. Children in group 1, consistent with their concept of life, gave a greater number of accurate judgments and revisions for type B sentences than for either sentence types A or C. Contrary to expectations, however, they were more accurate in their judgments and revisions of type C sentences than type A sentences. The scores for children in group 2 were significantly higher on sentence types B and C than on sen- tence type A, consistent with their attribution of life to only autonomously moving objects. There were no differences in their scores for sentence types B and C. Group 3 children pro- vided a greater number of correct judgments and revisions for sentence types B and C than for sentence type A, contrary to the prediction that they would perform equally well on the three sentence types. However, it should be reiterated that the performance of these chil- dren on sentence type A exceeded that of the children in the other groups. Task Agreement The children's judgments and revisions of sentences on the judgment task agreed closely with their responses to questionnaire items in the 12 cases in which subject nouns were also questionnaire items. The observed frequency of agreements was 431 out of 560 cases, which was significantly different from the expected frequency of agreements, X2 (1) = 162.86, p &lt; .001. Discussion The results, for the most part, confirmed the predictions concerning the relationship be- tween the children's stated concepts of life and their performances on the three types of anom- alous sentences. However, several deviations from these predictions were noted. One possi- ble source of these deviations might have been</page><page sequence="7">370 Child Development the limited assessment of the children's beliefs concerning the animacy of specific subject-noun referents. In the 12 cases in which subject nouns also appeared as questionnaire items, there was close agreement between the chil- dren's responses to the questionnaire items and their judgments and revisions of the correspond- ing sentences. The failure to examine the chil- dren's beliefs concerning each subject noun may have led to at least one of the unexpected findings. The group 3 children were less ac- curate in their judgments and revisions of type A (autonomous) sentences than type C sen- tences. It may have been the case that while these children did not, in general, attribute life to inanimate objects, as indicated by their ques- tionnaire responses, there may have remained some objects exhibiting autonomous movement to which they did attribute life. The source of the remaining deviations from the predictions may have been the chil- dren's awareness of object characteristics more specific than animacy or inanimacy. An exami- nation of the children's corrections of and re- sponses to sentences they judged to be "silly," such as "The white cloud eats up the sun," revealed a number of instances in which they gave responses such as "That's silly. Clouds can't eat. They don't have mouths." Many chil- dren who gave such responses were children who, on the questionnaire, indicated that they considered clouds to be alive. Thus such sen- tence judgments may have been based on the belief that clouds do not have mouths rather than the belief that clouds are not alive. A final question which warrants considera- tion is whether the children viewed the anoma- lous sentences as metaphors. The patterns of judgments and revisions provided by the chil- dren in groups 0 and 3 seem to resemble close- ly other findings concerning children's develop- ing preferences for similes (Gardner, Kircher, Winner, &amp; Perkins 1975) and explanations of metaphors (Winner, Rosensteil, &amp; Gardner 1976). Early in development, children appear to accept both appropriate and inappropriate similes and offer what seem to be magical or fantasy-based explanations for metaphors. The undifferentiated acceptance of the anomalous sentences by the group 0 children would ap- pear to be consistent with this level of meta- phoric abilities. Subsequently, children's preferences for similes and explanations of metaphors reflect a highly literal orientation. Similes that are literal and concrete are preferred to those that are nonliteral. In addition, children at this point in development offer strictly literal explanations for metaphors. The undifferentiated rejections and appropriate revisions of the anomalous sentences provided by the group 3 children appear to be consistent with this level of meta- phoric behavior. The differential performances of the chil- dren in groups 1 and 2 across the anomalous- sentence types were not, however, consistent with any reported findings concerning the de- velopment of metaphoric abilities. This would seem to suggest that the anomalous sentences in the present investigation were not viewed as metaphors. However, the relationship between relevant presuppositions, such as those ex- amined here, and the development of meta- phoric abilities remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The results of this study indicated the existence of a close relationship between chil- dren's stated concepts of life and their judg- ments and revisions of sentences with viola- tions of animacy restrictions. These findings offer strong support for Lakoff's argument that presuppositions are closely related to and, in fact, influence judgments of the well formed- ness of sentences. There are also significant implications for developmental investigations of metalinguistic judgments. It would appear to be inappropriate, particularly in cases where children's beliefs may differ significantly from those held by adults, to examine children's judgments of well formedness without due con- sideration of the relevant presuppositions which may be held by the child. In conclusion, the results of this investigation suggest that chil- dren's abilities to judge the well formedness of sentences do not develop in isolation but, rath- er, to a large extent may depend on the devel- opment of children's beliefs about the world.
