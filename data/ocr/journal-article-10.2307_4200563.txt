<plain_text><page sequence="1">83 EXPELLING DEMONS AT NINEVEH: ON THE VISIBILITY OF BENEVOLENT DEMONS IN THE PALACES OF NINEVEH By TALLAY ORNAN* As has been shown and extensively dealt with in early and more recent scholarship, Neo-Assyrian palatial wall reliefs went through many thematic changes throughout their two hundred and fifty years of existence. One of their conspicuous traits was a gradual abandoning of magical-religious subject matters, represented by protective supernatural beings, in favour of larger and more detailed historical compositions mostly of a belligerent nature - revealing, for the first time in antiquity, a truer sense of narrative display. As the narrative-historical themes were rightly considered to be an innovative and prominent contribution of Assyrian imagery to the history of art, extensive efforts have been devoted to the study of these compositions within the context of Assyrian palaces.' In the present contribution I intend, however, to concentrate on the "losing" side of Assyrian palatial decoration, namely to focus on the visibility of apotropaic fantastic creatures rendered on wall reliefs and to offer some explanation for their gradual expulsion from the pictorial display of the Assyrian palace. Following Porada, in this essay these hybrids are called demons, in accordance with the Greek term daimon.2 Benevolent demons appear already in early ninth- century Neo-Assyrian wall reliefs, both in temples, as shown by a small number of slabs from the Ninurta Temple at Nimrud,3 and much more commonly in palaces, in particular within the North- West Palace. The appearance and roles of these demons are also illustrated through cheap clay figurines, through textual references alluding to them, and through legends describing their functions and, at times, naming them.4 As I will focus here on the pictorial correspondence between the royal image and that of the protective figures, I will refer only to human-shaped, upright and two- legged first-millennium hybrids. It will be shown here that the manner in which these apotropaic figures were represented was modified, especially in terms of their relationship to the image of the king - the main protagonist of Assyrian wall reliefs. This transformation will be demonstrated by focusing on the portrayals of demons depicted within the palaces of Nineveh: the South-West Palace of Sennacherib and the North Palace of Ashurbanipal - both reflecting the last phase of Assyrian monumental art. In order to achieve this purpose it seems best to compare the hybrids from Nineveh with earlier demons sculptured on slabs from the North-West Palace at Nimrud. The highlighting of the difference between the supernatural beings of the North-West Palace and those appearing in the South-West and North Palaces at Nineveh will provide an opportunity to touch upon two points. The first is a certain inconsistency regarding the depictions of seventh- century supernatural beings, which is also implied when texts alluding to these creatures and pictures are juxtaposed. The second point is to connect the change in the visibility of human- shaped protective demons in seventh-century palatial decoration to wider trends apparent in monumental Assyrian art. The following comparison will deal, then, with "demonic" imagery as it appeared in the two chronological extremities of Neo-Assyrian art. It will examine the visual association apparent between the royal image and the demons by applying four pictorial aspects to shed light on the role, status, and hence importance of protective demons in the context of the Assyrian palaces: (a) the position of the demons within the architectural programme of wall decoration; (b) the physical proximity of demons to the royal figure; (c) the participation of demons in palatial activities and (d) the scale of the depicted demons. * Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

The position of demons within the palatial architectural programme Erect, human-shaped two-legged benevolent demons appear in the North-West Palace at Nimrud at various focal points: on almost all the walls of the east and south suites; in room F and enclave C of the throne room suite; in the corners and entrances of throne room B; and in the most pivotal location, behind the king's seat on slab 23 of the throne room. In addition they are shown repeatedly in most of the palace's doorways and on the walls of some of its courts. Three general types of winged human-shaped beings were represented in the North-West Palace: two human- headed figures, one wearing a horned mitre, the second adorned with a headband, and a third figure with an eagle-shaped head, equated with an apkallu sage.5 That these supernatural beings were imbued with meaning and were considered among the most valued images selected for the North-West Palace is demonstrated by their numerous occurrences within this royal residence. Their significant role within the palatial pictorial symbolism is reinforced by their frequent juxtaposition with a schematized tree - a highly valued inanimate visual sign either referring to major Assyrian deities or to notions of abundance, or functioning as a separate apotropaic image - in particular in rooms I and L of the ceremonial east suite and in room F of the throne- room suite.6 A sharp contrast with the aforementioned situation, however, is revealed in both the South- West7 and North8 Palaces at Nineveh, where benevolent demons appear only as guardian figures in doorways and on open court walls adjacent to entrances. The restriction of the demons to these specific palace locations may imply that the demons in later Assyrian palaces were deprived of their various tasks and left mainly with the role of protecting the building and its inhabitants - a role which, nonetheless, is not to be underestimated. B. The physical proximity of demons to royalfigures If we accept the notion that it is the image of the king which constitutes the main protagonist of Assyrian wall reliefs - both the magical, and the historical narrative9 the proximity of a demon to the royal figure can be considered as a sign conveying the status of a given demon. Accordingly, many of the aforementioned slabs from the North-West Palace, in particular those from the east suite, demonstrate that benevolent demons were not only displayed at focal points within the palace, they were specifically and, presumably, deliberately depicted in physical proxim- ity to the royal figure.'0 The almost intimate closeness between the king and the protective demon is missing, however, from the portrayals of Sennacherib at the South-West Palace and from those of Ashurbanipal in the North Palace at Nineveh. On the reliefs of these two monarchs the king is frequently shown standing in his chariot while supervising military or building activities. On these occasions, he is either alone or accompanied only by mortal figures: soldiers, charioteers or bodyguards." The 5Reade, 1979, 35-7. Wiggermann, 1992, 65, 75-6. Russell, 1998, 674.

Detail of a relief in the South-West Palace at Nineveh, room XLVIII (from Barnett et a!., 1998, P1. 58:529). removal of human-scale benevolent demons from the physical surroundings of the king is further demonstrated in a few cases where the king is shown enthroned, a stance regarded as conveying a more elevated status.12 For example, in the portrayal of Sennacherib on slab 12 in room XXXVI in the South-West Palace, where he is shown supervising the siege of Lachish and receiving its spoils of war, the king is accompanied by apotropaic figures shown on the supports of his throne (Fig. 1 ). A similarly decorated throne of Sennacherib is represented on slab 20 of room XLVII, where the king is seated within a fortified camp located in a wooded mountainous area, receiving captives (Fig. 2).13 However, the protective figures accompanying Sennacherib in these two latter cases are totally reduced in scale in comparison to the demons surrounding the king on the North- West Palace reliefs. The small dimensions of the supernatural beings surrounding the king in these cases, so vividly conveyed by the depictions of both nendlu thrones, can be confirmed by an actual find of an apotropaic bronze figurine (h. 35 cm) of an atlantid bull-man (kusacrikku) discovered at Tell Mahuz west of Kirkuk, which may confirm the rather small dimensions of the apotropaic images depicted on the sides of the thrones of Sennacherib. In his small-sized representation of the benevolent protective demons Sennacherib was probably imitating the depiction of Ninlil on the rock relief Pls.

To this end, indeed, reducing the scale of a protective being seems to have been an almost vital requirement, so that the supernatural figures would not compete with the king. The proximity of the demons to the very body of the monarch is, furthermore, manifested in the North-West Palace of Nimrud by the depictions of royal garments. This is especially evident on a few detailed portrayals of the king in room G of the east suite, as on slabs 3 and 8, where he is wearing a highly-adorned dress, probably suitable for the cultic ceremonies in which he is taking part (e.g. Fig. 3). The demons shown in these cases are human and eagle-headed figures 14Curtis 1988, 86, Pls. 80-2. It should be noted that in other portrayals of enthroned Sennacherib no protective demons are shown.

Detail of royal garment, North Palace at Nineveh, room Si, (after Barnett, 1976, P1. 65). very similar to the larger representations within the North-West palace.15 Although the images of Ashurnasirpal on the above-mentioned slabs are represented in a different situation from those of Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal in the palaces of Nineveh, it should be stressed that protective demons are missing in seventh-century traceable depictions of royal Assyrian garments. The royal attire in these cases seems to comprise only geometric and floral patterns sometimes referring, as in the case of the rosettes, to divinities like Ishtar (e.g. Fig. 5).16 C. The participation of demons in palace activities Some of the demons decorating garments from the North-West Palace are represented as actively involved in a cultic performance or in scenes where they fight fantastic creatures (Figs. 3-4).17 These compositions bring us to the third criterion for evaluating the role of demons in palatial monumental art, namely the degree to which they were displayed as participating in activities rendered in palatial decoration. The involvement of demons in ceremonies depicted on reliefs may reflect their perceived active involvement in ceremonies carried out within the palace. Activity in the representations of large-scale demons is achieved not by common pictorial means such as movement or contrasted directions of figures,'8 but rather by providing the demons with specific attributes. These attributes consist mainly of the banduddu2 bucket and the mullilu purifier, as well as a stem with flowers (illuiru?) or a mace.'9 When demons carrying these attributes were displayed in association with the king, or with inanimate symbols, such as the schematized tree, we can assume that the viewer comprehended their active role. The ancient beholder was probably familiar with the clues with which such scenes were invested, and thus was able to perceive their message: the king is purified by the demons. The demons are portrayed as active figures and part of a display oriented to a specific audience, and they most probably attracted much of the attention of the "knowledgeable" viewer selected to enter the palace. Assuming that the extent to which images are attractive to the spectator reflects their status within a given picture, the relative 5 Layard, 1849, Pls. 5-8. Russell 1998, Fig. 13. 16Protective demons are missing from other types of the royal dress of Ashurnasirpal, mainly shown in war scenes but also when he is gesturing before Ashur in the winged disc on slab 23, throne room B (Layard, Nineveh and Babylon I, Figs. 13, 15, 34).

Russell, 1998, 675.</page><page sequence="6">88 TALLAY ORNAN prominence of the demons engaged in scenes together with the king or with a schematized tree, as opposed to demons shown "on their own" in passageways, can thus be established. The visibility of the cultic involvement of benevolent demons in the magico-religious ceremonies of the North- West Palace is specifically demonstrated by their extensive representations in rooms I and L and by their almost exclusive representations in room H of the east suite, regarded as a highly central architectural unit, where palatial ceremonies involving liquids were carried out.20 In many compositions displayed in rooms G and H, where demons appear in close proximity to the king, the latter is shown carrying arrows or a bowl in his right hand, while holding in his left hand a reversed bow that rests on the ground. The presence of demons together with the king in these representations, in particular when he is shown raising two arrows (e.g. Fig. 3), not only defines these renderings as alluding to the purification of royal, god-granted weapons, but also conveys that here the king is being purified by the demons21 and is thus represented as a passive figure. In contrast, as the active purifying demons are removed from the image of the king on the wall reliefs of both the South-West and the North Palaces at Nineveh, the situation is reversed. The passive purified king becomes the active purifying image who replaces the demons. This is rather clearly demonstrated by the portrayal of Sennacherib in the above-mentioned Lachish relief (Fig. 1). The king is represented with only small accompanying apotropaic demons who display no attributes, and at the same time he wields the bow and arrows like his predecessors, thus implying that he has already been purified and is, in turn, the one who is responsible for purifying the weapons. Thus, one of the formerly conspicuous cultic functions of the protective demons, visually articulated in the North-West Palace at Nimrud, was appropriated by the king at Nineveh and hence contributed to his elevation through pictorial representation. As suggested by Magen, the cultic role of performing the post-battle cleansing rites was probably transferred from the supernatural figure to the royal image early in the reign of Tiglath-pileser III. In addition to a portrayal of the latter monarch adjacent to a protective demon carrying the attribute of a stem with flowers, Tiglath-pileser is himself shown holding a three-blossomed branch. This latter attribute, carried by some of the earlier demons in the North-West Palace, hints that it is the king who now actively replaces the demons in purifying weapons.22 Similarly, the date palm shoot (libbi gi&amp;immari) held by the "purifying king" in the South-West Palace and re-used by Ashurbanipal in the North Palace, can be traced back to the North-West palace where it is grasped by some of the demons. Compositions portraying Ashurbanipal poised in his chariot, accompanied by courtiers and soldiers, holding a palm-shoot and supervising the surrender of his enemies, depict him as being pure and at the same time as purifying the army after the battle.23 D. The scale of demons The many full-scale, supernatural, beneficial figures so often depicted in the North-West Palace at Nimrud cover the entire stone slab, whereas in the South-West and North Palaces at Nineveh they only appear in doorways and courts. The location of large-scale demons in passageways accords well with their important role as protective images which ward off evil. However, their later restriction to doorways, in addition to their disappearance from other focal localities of the palace, their removal from the very body of the king and their replacement by the king in performing purification rituals, suggest that they were to some degree deprived of their former status. The reduction of their status within palatial decoration is also hinted at by their more passive depiction when safeguarding doorways. Discussion The apparent decreased visibility of benevolent demons in the South-West and North Palaces of Nineveh by no means indicates, however, a lesser need for the supernatural protection of royal activities in general and of the royal residence in particular. This is demonstrated not only by 20Russell, 1998, 671-4 (with previous bibliography). 21 Magen, 1986, 67-9, 81-2.

Huge figure holding lion. various clay figurines, some of which are inscribed with identifying prescriptions, buried under floors or in specific corners of palaces,24 but also by a larger selection of demon types represented in the palaces of Nineveh. From three main types of protective beings in the North-West Palace and the Ninurta Temple (human-headed demons and bird- and fish-apkallti25), the number of erect, two-legged apotropaic images rendered in the South-West Palace increased to seven different types. The repertoire of protective images in the South-West Palace included winged human- headed and fish-garbed figures depicted in the North-West Palace at Nimrud, and a huge human- like hero holding a small lion, already known during the reign of Sargon II (Fig. 6). These beneficial images were complemented in the South-West Palace by four new types rendered monumentally: a six-curled figure identified with the lahmu; an empty-handed Lual (il-biti) wearing a horned mitre and raising his right fist; a lion-headed, eagle-footed ugallu; and a bull-legged figure, probably to be identified as the uridimmu (Fig. 7).26 The introduction of these new apotropaic demons may explain the proportional decrease in the visibility of the three older types in the South-West Palace. For example, whereas the winged human-headed demons and fish- apkallii appeared some ninety times in Sargon's palace at Khorsabad, they were only shown, according to Kolbe, some twenty-four times in the South-West Palace.27 The variety of benevolent creatures in the South-West Palace conveys a rich and an innovative selection of beneficial demons, inspired, it seems, from Babylonian imagery, which fits very well with the other iconographical inclinations of Sennacherib.28 It was in fact the strong need for supernatural protection which may have inspired this creative remodelling of new types of demons. Admittedly, as argued by Russell, "Sennacherib made visible that which had previously been invisible" he displayed on 24 Rittig, 1977. Wiggermann, 1992. 25 Russell, 1998, 674-5 (for fish-apkallu see Wiggermann, 1992, 65, 76-7). 26 Wiggermann, 1992, 57, 164-6, 169-74. Russell, 1991, 179-86.

Hence, their role within the architectural programme of the South-West Palace was modified and, in some respect, reduced. The images of Lual (il-biti), the lion-headed ugallu, the six-curled lahmu and the bull-legged uridimmu continued to be depicted in doorways of the North Palace. Although it seems that the number of types of two-legged, erect apotropaic demons was reduced, the creative articulation of supernatural images continued in the North Palace at Nineveh. This is evident from the disappear- ance of the winged human-headed demon from the North Palace, as well as from the creation of new compositions with older hybrids, such as the two confronting ugallui represented at the entrances of rooms S and T of the North Palace.30 The continuity of a dynamic tradition that required newly articulated supernatural beings within the North Palace is reinforced by the introduction of a formerly unknown type of guardian demon: an anthropomorphic figure wielding an axe and a dagger (Fig. 8). Three such demons, identified with the sebetti representing the Pleiades and standing for the seven gods of fate, are depicted on slabs 1 and 4 in an entrance (a) 29Russell, 1991, 186. 30Barnett, 1976, Pls. XLV, LV.</page><page sequence="9">EXPELLING DEMONS AT NINEVEH 91 leading from court 0 to room I. These were probably complemented by additional, now missing similar images, which stood on the other side of the entrance.3l The innovative imagery of beneficial demons located in doorways revealed in the South-West and North Palaces seems to be in accordance with seventh-century texts. This is evident with regard to Ashurbanipal, who like his father was especially concerned with the protection of supernatural guardian figures, as implied by such texts as "The Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince".32 In addition to the rather large number of supernatural beings referred to in this text - which, however, do not necessarily have similar apotropaic traits and are not easily identified with pictorial types - Ashurbanipal's fear of misfortune and his dependence on divine prophylactic activities are probably implied in such cases as the colophon of the bTt rimki ritual. In this text, the king tells of his reading ability, probably resulting from his training, when young, as a future priest, and which perhaps motivated his great concern for the correct performance of apotropaic ceremonies.33 It seems, then, that some ambiguity can be traced when juxtaposing the dynamic articulation of types of protective demons demonstrated during the reigns of Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal, sustained by contemporary textual evidence, with the above observations suggesting a restricted visibility of these beings in seventh-century palatial monuments. While no doubt still in much need, beneficial demons were no longer equally represented in the pictorial program of sculptured wall decoration at Nineveh. Indeed, this decreased visibility of demons does not convey a diminished need for their protection, but rather shows a stronger awareness of their visibility when confronted with that of the king, which may shed light on the latter's status when pictorially rendered. The removal of demons from the very body of the king, their absence from focal palatial localities, and their exclusion from prophylactic cults, clearly allowed for prominence of the royal figure within the pictorial arena. The reduced visibility of demons in palatial decoration may, thus, be regarded as one of the means of upgrading the Assyrian monarch in Assyrian monumental art. This apparent contradiction between a picture and its referred subject-matter underscores the notion that visual display cannot always be regarded as an exact reflection of the situation or theme it aims to represent. When transmitted into the pictorial arena, a given theme was often modified according to demands governed by a specific pictorial message.34 In the case examined here - the pictorial relationship of royal and divine images it can indeed be argued that the earthly demands of elevating the ruler in Assyrian art suppressed the magico-religious ones and resulted in the diminished visibility of supernatural beings. This phenomenon should not surprise us, since protective demons were not the only divine entities that were almost expelled from sculptured decoration. As can be seen from all Assyrian wall reliefs dating from the ninth to seventh centuries, even the major deities of Assyria were not actually represented in Assyrian palatial architectural decoration. When deities do occasionally appear in wall decoration they are shown in very small dimensions compared to the mortal hero of the reliefs, as exemplified by the image of Ashur blessing or engaged in a martial display on some slabs from room B of the North- West Palace.3" Minimizing divine representations is also evident with regard to other major Assyrian deities, who appear in these cases only as miniature additions, at times hardly visible at all. The deities in these instances were selected not for their own merit, but rather by virtue of their role as protectors of military activities, as is exemplified by the image of Ishtar shown on a yoke-pole of a chariot of Ashurbanipal on slab 14 of room C of the Great Lion Hunt in the North Palace.36 By eliminating supernatural images, protective demons as well as prominent gods and goddesses from sculptured Assyrian wall reliefs, competition for the attention of the beholder was prevented and the Assyrian monarch remained the only protagonist. However, as abstention from portraying major deities in pictorial renderings is well demonstrated in other media of Assyrian art and particularly in contemporary Babylonia, it seems that apart from being a tool 3 Gadd in Barnett, 1976, 48, P1.
