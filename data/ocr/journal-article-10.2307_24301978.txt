<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Manuscript of Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge By Christine Winfield I THE manuscript of Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, composed in 1884-85 and now in the possession of Dorset County Museum, Dorchester, is only partly com plete. It is written on 3 74 sheets of ruled paper measuring 63/2" x 7%" The sheets are numbered 1-479 in Hardy's hand, but five are frag mentary (ff. 97,106, 215,319,396); 108 are missing altogether; and there are three supplementary sheets (ff. 1 i6a-b, 133a) not included in the foliation. The missing leaves are generally in sequences of two to eight, though a number of scattered leaves are also absent. The miss ing leaves occur most frequently in the first twelve chapters of the novel. Only eleven lines of Chapter II survive, and Chapter VI is en tirely absent. Of the novel's forty-five chapters, eighteen only are complete. If we exclude ff. 97 and 319 which have obviously been torn unintentionally, the presence of several fragmentary leaves is pre sumably explained by Hardy's practice of cutting away canceled material.1 Though offered as printers' copy,2 the manuscript has many dele tions, interlinear substitutions, and interpolations, and there are addi tions on the verso of thirty-eight leaves. There is moreover a marked disparity in the distribution of revisions throughout the text; for while a large area of the manuscript may be classed as fair copy, other por tions present the text in various stages of development. With admitted simplification, these stages can be divided into three Sections: (1) ff. 1 Richard Little Purdy, Thomas Hardy: A Bibliographical Study (London 1954), p. 8 8, refers to this procedure in connection with the MS. of Jude the Obscure. 2 The Mayor was first published in twenty weekly installments (2 Jan.-i5 May 1886) in The Graf hie: An Illustrated Weekly Newspaper, and the use of the MS. by the Graphic printers is indicated by the presence of penciled square brackets and by the signatures "Alb," "Hickman," "Fred," and others (evidently those of the compositors), which occur at regular intervals throughout the text. (See, e.g., ff. 4, 164, 182.) 33</page><page sequence="2">34 Bibliographical Society of America 1-225 (Chs. I-XXII), (2) ff. 226-418 (Chs. XXIII-XL), and (3) if. 419-79 (Chs. XLI-XLV). The first and last sections generally contain the most heavily revised areas of the text, while the inter mediate section presents the least revised portion. While the paper on which it is written is of the same type through out—a ruled page of twenty-one lines—examination of the physical state of the leaves reveals that two quite separate stocks of the same type of paper were used during the course of composition. The paper in one stock (Stock A) is of poorer quality and condition than that in the other: the leaves are generally more soiled, and many are foxed and damp-stained. The paper is azure in color and the feint lines are pale blue and clearly defined. In the second stock (Stock B) the paper is of superior quality: the leaves are thicker in texture and whiter in color, with feint lines generally less conspicuous than those in the first stock. The paper is almost invariably in better condition, the leaves much less soiled and showing only occasional foxing and damp staining. Now a general correspondence is evident between the discrepancy in paper stock and the division of the manuscript text into areas distin guished by their density of revision. The greater part of Sections I and III (the areas of heaviest revision) are written on leaves from Stock A, while that of Section II (the area of least revision) is written on leaves from Stock B. There are, however, notable exceptions in the first half of the manuscript which suggest a correlation not only be tween paper stock and stage of composition but also between paper stock and period of composition. For in Section I, Chapter XII (if. 110-16a) contains paper from both stocks 5 and an inspection of the re visions here reveals that the chapter has been partly rewritten, and that the material on leaves belonging to Stock B (namely, if. no, in, 113, 116, 116a) appears to have been written well after the first half of the story (that is, during the composition of Section II). In Section II itself, ff. 214-15 are written on paper from Stock A and appear from the revision they contain to be survivals from a previously discarded chapter. Further evidence for the correlation (in the first half of the text) between paper stock and period of composition is to be found in the surviving traces, through a minor portion of the text, of a canceled system of foliation—a feature discussed in Part II of this article.</page><page sequence="3">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge" 35 One other preliminary factor to be considered in any textual study of Hardy's work is the similarity between Hardy's handwriting and that of his first wife Emma.3 The differences between the two scripts are small enough almost to escape notice on a cursory reading. It is well known that Emma often acted as transcriber for the fair copies of her husband's manuscripts (large sections of The Return of the Native and The Woodlanders, for instance, appear in her hand), and it has been sug gested that Emma, who herself entertained literary aspirations, may possibly have entered on her husband's manuscripts not only his re visions but her own as well.4 While this conjecture is of course impos sible to prove, the extent of Emma's contribution at least deserves consideration. Fortunately the manuscript of the Mayor appears to be almost en tirely in Hardy's hand.5 The script of the interlinear elements of the text is slightly more difficult to identify, since Hardy's style of writing in this area tends to differ somewhat from his usual hand. Assuming however that Emma was simply transcribing and not creating re visions, the identification of the handwriting is not of great importance. The absence of material earlier than the present manuscript of the Mayor makes it impossible to establish with any confidence the close ness of the roughest drafts in the manuscript to the period of incep tion. Unlike Dickens, George Eliot, and Joyce, who left in note form tentative plans of the structure of certain of their novels and so offered valuable information on their methods of composition, Hardy almost invariably destroyed the first experimental plans of his work, and hence the earliest surviving drafts of his novels are usually the manu scripts offered to the printers. Yet the limited evidence that is avail able of Hardy's earliest working plans suggests that the apparently tentative nature of many of the heavily altered or canceled passages 3 This problem is mentioned (with use of inadequate criteria for distinguishing the scripts) in Carl J. Weber's article "The Manuscript of Hardy's Two on a Tower," PBS A, 40 (1946), 1-21; and much more satisfactorily, by Dale Kramer in "A Query Concerning Handwriting in Hardy's Manuscripts," PBSA, 57 (1963), 357-60. 4 Kramer, "A Query Concerning Handwriting," 358. 5 The only exceptions I have noted are those found in the canceled writing on the verso of ff. 112, 116a, 172, 335, 413 (first one and a half lines) ; in the surviving fragment of the first line of f. 319, and the folio number and first line of ff. 94 and 331, all of which appear to be in Emma Hardy's hand.</page><page sequence="4">36 Bibliographical Society of America must undoubtedly have been preceded by much preparatory work. The source of this evidence is twofold: first, the manuscript of the sketches "A Few Crusted Characters,"6 which Hardy entitled "Wes sex Folk" and described as a "First Rough Draft" 5 and second, two surviving fragments of the "First Draft" of Far jrom the Madding Crowd (now in the Dorset County Museum). According to Purdy, the "Wessex Folk" manuscript is "a very rough hurried first draft (in places hardly more than notes)" and it has "notes and alterations on the verso of many leaves and at the end a good many trial names."7 The surviving leaves of the first draft of Far jrom the Madding Crowd, while showing Hardy's work at a more advanced stage of composition than the "Wessex Folk" manuscript, nevertheless displays the same features of experiment and denotation suggested in Purdy's descrip tion. The second of the two fragments forms part of an unnumbered chapter8 to which Hardy later supplied the note "Details of sheep rot—omitted from MS. when revised." This fragment is composed of eleven leaves (numbered io6a-k) of heavily revised material. The tentative nature of the writing, evident throughout, is seen in his placing of queries after words: "The (fatting) wethers (?) about to be fatted had no bell." (f. io6h) 59 and in the offer of several alternatives for a descriptive adj ective: steaming the fulsome firmament above noxious vapoury (f. lo6e) 6 The sketches form one of a collection of nine stories first published in book form by Osgood, Mcllvaine in 1894, under the title Life's Little Ironies. The MS. is now in the Bliss collection. 7 Purdy, p. 84. 8 Although the chapter was later canceled, elements of a descriptive passage on f. io6f were incorporated into the description of the Hollow in Ch. XLIV of the familiar text of Far from the Madding Crowd. The fragment is headed simply "Chapter," a factor which, together with the surviving lines of material (later canceled) on ff. 106 and 155* of the Mayor MS., headed by a similarly unspecified "Chapter," suggests that Hardy's practice was to number his chapters some considerable time after composition. 9 In all quotation from the Hardy MSS. discussed here the following method will be used: deletions will be placed within angular brackets (( )), and where the reading of a cancellation is doubtful the word in question will be followed by a query enclosed in square brackets ([?]); where illegible, it will be replaced by a blank (———) ; interlinear addi tions which represent the final form of the MS. text will be placed in italics. All wording, spelling, and interior punctuation will correspond with the original, even where unconven tional (e.g., Hardy frequently omitted quotation marks enclosing dialogue).</page><page sequence="5">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge" 37 Of greater interest still is the fragmentary sentence on f. io6f, comple tion of which is indicated by suspension points and a brief note (simply a phrase from Hamlet) incorporating the idea to be expanded: the presence of the fiery mist was caused by the effect of the hot sun's rays upon the swamp that afternoon . . . "god kissing carrion" etc. its colour, of course, by the reflection and refraction of the sun's rays. + (f. lo6f) The addendum to this note (indicated at the end of the sentence by the mark +) appears on the verso of f. io6e, and consists of a partially constructed sentence comprising only those aspects of the description salient in the author's mind; namely, the unpleasing anthropomorphic features of the obj ects described—an element characteristic of Hardy's handling of natural scenery. Blanks are left for material as yet un formulated: "desc. these fungi thus. Then there was the with its bloody skin and spots. . .. There was also" (f.io6e); Im mediately above this note further details of the fungi (written in pencil and later erased) have been added: "clammy tops, crowns, ooz ing gills—splotches red as arterial blood." The fragment contains many similar pencilings, a method of composition which Hardy con fined not only to early draft, for there are frequent traces throughout the Mayor manuscript of interlinear pencilings, usually comprising words or phrases later overwritten in ink. Indeed the remaining traces of a now erased penciled note in Chapter XII present the single in stance of revision in the Mayor to show the incompleteness of the work ing draft. This occurs between lines 12 and 13 on f. 114, where Hardy has added a summary of material to be expanded: Henchard has just told the young Scotsman Farfrae of his recent involvement with Lucetta Le Sueur, and the note suggests that he is to set the seal on the episode with an emphatic, if melodramatic, gesture, for the erasure reads as follows: "there's an end of her and here goes her picture. Burns it flame creeps up face etc." The incident however does not ap pear in the final form of the manuscript, either because Hardy may not after all have expanded the note, or because he omitted it when re working the chapter, most of which was rewritten before the comple tion of the manuscript. With this one exception virtually no material in the Mayor manuscript presents Hardy's work at so preliminary a stage as that of the first draft of Far jrom the Madding Crowd.</page><page sequence="6">jfi —1*7? *»y /ti-j Uf Cyi. &lt;£ fi*v ffT.

A typical example of Hardy's careful revision of passages of rustic dialogue.</page><page sequence="7">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge''' 39 While the manuscript of the Mayor presents a far from homoge neous text—that is to say, a study of its revisions reveals several dif ferent phases in the composition of the novel—Hardy's particular methods of revision frequently make it difficult to distinguish between fair copy and earlier draft. There are of course numerous leaves on which fair copy is readily detected: the relative absence of revision on fif. 212, 261, and 269, for instance, together with factors of line spacing (as on ff. 42 and 120) and foliation (f. 116a) suggests that re writing had taken place. Yet if absence of revision implies fair copy, the very frequency with which Hardy reviewed his material makes density of revision an unreliable criterion for assessing the stage of composition. There are numerous leaves in the manuscript which, if intended as fair copy, are yet difficult to detect as such, from the extent of later emendation, as well as from changes made during the act of copying. This point is of particular relevance to those areas of the text which generally receive the greatest amount of revision; namely, dialogue (that of rustic characters in particular) and passages of description. The text of many such passages, while sufficiently polished to have originally represented fair copy (prior, that is, to revision), neverthe less contain several layers of emendation, as for example, ff. 49, 73, 174,10 371, 445, and 473. Hardy appears then to have rewritten pages of fair copy only when the extent of subsequent revision made this imperative. Evidence that Hardy subjected his work to revision immediately after and sometimes during the act of composition (or perhaps more accurately, during the act of copying) is provided by the canceled ma terial on the verso of a number of sheets which contain the discarded beginnings of several leaves.11 Hardy's practice seems to have been to invert and use as fair copy the verso of a previously discarded leaf if the canceled material did not extend beyond nine or ten lines. Several of these pages contain corrections even when the material extends to no more than a sentence in length. Three illustrations of this practice may be cited: 10 A facsimile of f. 174 is reproduced overleaf. 11 Viz. the verso of ff. 112, 116a, 128, 155, 172, 244, 261, 327, 335, 384, 413, and 454.</page><page sequence="8">40 Bibliographical Society oj America 24-3 "Then the romance of the sower is gone for ever," sd Donald, returned, fixing itselj "Yes—yes. ...

(f. 26lv) 383 People thus waited and watched the far-off London highway, to the ringing of bells, till a man stationed at the turn of the road was seen to give a signal. (f. 384^) While it would be a gross simplification to suggest that the correc tions in a heavily revised manuscript like the the Mayor could be di vided into discrete chronological units, the interlinear position, style of writing, pen thickness, and ink color in which many of the changes are made do make it possible to detect what appear to be specific groups of revision. In particular two separate groupings may be distinguished: first, those revisions written with a very fine-nibbed pen and in black ink (the color used throughout the manuscript); second, those revi sions written in a greyish purple ink and with a pen thickness similar to that used throughout the manuscript. These revision groupings are worth noting, not only for the infor mation they yield on the probable stage of composition at which cer tain amendments were made, but also for the illustration they afford of the frequency and thoroughness of Hardy's revision; for their distri bution in the text suggests that Hardy reviewed his material after com pleting about two thirds of the novel, as well as subjecting it to a more extensive revision after completion of the entire work. The fine-pen revisions register numerous kinds of change, both stylistic and substantive, as well as a number of name changes, in par ticular, the amendment of the Scotsman's surname from the earlier "Stansbie" to the final form "Farfrae." Moreover, several additions on leaf verso are written in fine-pen.12 The revisions in grey ink in Sec tion I most frequently register the name changes "Alan" to "Donald" (for the Scotsman), and "Giles" to "James" (earlier forms of Hen 12 Viz. the verso of ff. 46, 81, 456.</page><page sequence="9">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge" 41 chard's first name), whereas in Section II they register various kinds of change. Both groups of revision represent a fairly late stage in the novel's composition, since many from each group are in fact corrections of already revised material: When a number of revisions from one or other of these groups appear regularly over a stretch of text, it would seem reasonable to assume that they form a series of revisions entered over one specific period. Yet there is evidence to suggest that these revision groupings can be sub divided: while certain of the revisions in fine-pen have clearly been made before Chapter XLII at the latest, other revisions in a similar pen have obviously been entered after completion of the novel. Evi dence for this appears in the series of changes made for the names of Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae. Henchard's first name is re corded as "Giles" until Chapter XLII where it then appears as "James," remaining in that form for the rest of the manuscript. Thus all fine-pen revisions in the final section amending "James" to "Michael" must have been entered after completion of the text. The Scotsman's surname appears as "Stansbie" until Chapter XXIII13 where it is then recorded as "Farfrae." Now in an addition on the verso of f. 160 the unrevised "Farfrae" appears with "G. Henchard," a concurrence which indicates, then, that a further group of fine-pen revisions (namely those including the alteration "Farfrae") must have been entered during the period of the earliest phase of Hen chard's first name: that is, before Chapter XLII. When supported by factors of foliation and revision, evidence of name change can prove a valuable criterion in identifying different phases of the manuscript's history, and in this connection one series of changes in particular may be mentioned. These concern the revisions made in the naming of Donald Farfrae. He's homes fun A simfle (old) man . . . 'Tis barren ignorance that leads to such words. A never was fit for good company . . . (f. 76) (tables) the square (cloth) of hedged fields surfaces [grey-ink revision in italics] 13 Exceptions to this are discussed below.</page><page sequence="10">42 Bibliographical Society of America It would appear that the Scotsman was first called "Alan Stansbie," later "Alan Farfrae," and finally "Donald Farfrae." This order of change is suggested, though not exclusively so, on the one hand by the presence on several leaves of the unrevised "Alan" with the amend ment "Farfrae," and on the other hand by the appearance of the re vision "Donald" in an ink coloring used for the series of alterations which seem to postdate those of the "Farfrae" group. With the excep tion of six leaves, the name "Alan Stansbie" together with the inter linear substitutions "Donald" and "Farfrae" appears throughout the text until Chapter XXIII (f. 233) where for the first time the name "Donald Farfrae" appears unrevised, and is maintained in that form for the rest of the text. Exceptions to the appearance of the Scotsman's name as "Alan Stansbie" in leaves prior to Chapter XXIII are to be found on three scattered leaves between Chapters VIII and IX and on three leaves in Chapter XII, where the name appears unrevised in its final form. Its presence of fF. 110, 113, and 116 in Chapter XII is easily explained since the foliation, paper stock, and series of alterations suggest that the leaves in question were written at a later date than the rest of the chapter.14 The appearance, unrevised, of the final form of the surname between Chapters VIII and IX presents a greater difficulty. Chapter VI, in which the Scotsman is first introduced into the novel, is en tirely absent from the manuscript; mention of him simply as "the Scotch gentleman" (f. 61), or as "the young Scotchman" (f. 64), occurs in Chapter VII; and he makes his first appearance in Chapter VIII, where his name is recorded as "Alan" (f. 72). His surname first occurs on f. 73, then on ff. 77 and 81, and on all three occasions the name appears unrevised as "Farfrae." These represent the only oc currences of the surname until f. 95 where it is recorded as "Stansbie," remaining in that form (ch. XII excepted) until Chapter XXIII. The appearance of the surname in its final form at this stage in the text would seem initially to suggest either that "Farfrae" was the name that Hardy first thought of, later discarded, and finally returned to halfway through the manuscript, or that the pages on which the name appears were written at a later date than the surrounding leaves. Yet nothing in the foliation, paper stock, or other revisions indicates 14 Evidence for this assumption is discussed below.</page><page sequence="11">Manuscript of Hardfs "Mayor of Caster bridge''' 43 later composition; and while the possibility of a return to a previously discarded name presents a more likely alternative, the very physical appearance of the name on if. 73, 77, and 81 makes this doubtful. On all three leaves the name has been written with a fine-nibbed pen, conspicuously different from the surrounding writing, and correspond ing to the series of revisions in a similar fine writing made at a later stage of the novel's composition. There seem to be two possible explanations: either that Hardy was unable to decide on a suitable surname at this stage of composition and simply left a blank space which he filled in on subsequent revision, or alternatively, that a surname was entered tentatively in pencil and later erased when the name "Farfrae" had been finally established. The suggestion of tentative penciling is strengthened by the presence, mentioned earlier, of occasional traces throughout the manuscript of portions of the text which first appear in pencil and are later over written in ink. Erasure of a previous entry in ink is not likely, since there is no indication that the surface of the paper has been disturbed— a feature present elsewhere in the manuscript where erasure of writing in ink has been made.15 15 E.g., the following words, which have been written over a previous erasure: "trusser," "hay trusser" (f. 17), "browsing" (f. 130), "a very fugue of sounds" (f. 428). It seems worth mentioning here that the original name of the Scotsman ("Stansbie") and that of the Mayor himself ("Giles Henchard") both appear to have been drawn from John Hutchins' The History and. Antiquities of the County of Dorset, 3rd edn., 4 vols. (London 1861-73)— a work with which Hardy was thoroughly acquainted, and a copy of which he kept in his library. The point may be illustrated as follows: i) The name Stansbie seems to have been derived from that of a prominent figure in the civic history of seventeenth-century Dorchester. Included in a list of civic offices held in the town of Dorchester and recorded in Vol. II of the History, the name Philip Stansbie ap pears on three occasions: twice as bailiff for the years 1650 and 1660, and, of greater in terest, as Mayor for the year 1657 (Hutchins, II, 353-54). ii) The name Henchard may well have been derived from that of Trenchard, an ancient and important family in the history of Dorset. A detailed history of this family appears in the section on the parish of Litchet Maltravers (Hutchins, III). The first name Giles (Henchard's original name) is featured several times on the Trenchard family pedigree, and the suggested link between the two surnames is considerably strengthened when we learn from the History that the origin of the name Trenchard is reputedly that of the "Dano-Norman Dreng-hard or Drenc-hard, i.e. Strenuus Miles, vel Potator" (Hutchins, III, 325). Hardy's familiarity with both the name and its derivation is apparent in the naming of another of his characters: in "The Lady Penelope" (a short story written two or three years after the Mayor, and first printed in Longman's Magazine, Jan. 1890), the pedigree of the heroine's first husband is based on that of Sir George Trenchard, the actual name appearing in its earlier form (i.e. Drenghard), and the origin of which Hardy ex plains by quoting the Latin tag supplied by Hutchins.</page><page sequence="12">44 Bibliographical Society of America II Section I. Chapters I-X The first ten chapters of the manuscript contain leaves from the ear liest traceable phase of the novel's history. None of these chapters is complete, most are fragmentary, and one is missing altogether. The surviving leaves of Chapter I contain some of the heaviest revision in the manuscript, and an inspection of the cancellations on these sheets reveals not only the existence of an earlier text embedded in the first twenty leaves of the manuscript but also a marked discrepancy between the system of the foliation of the leaves and the order of their com position. While the plot was subjected to a major reorganization be fore the first leaves of the present manuscript were written, sheets from an earlier phase of the novel's history have been retained and adapted to fit the later conception. While the existence of this earlier text is most apparent in Chapter I, the salvaging and subsequent adaptation of leaves from an earlier text results in the presence, until well into the twenty-second chapter of the manuscript, of traces of an earlier draft of the novel. The surviving traces of the earlier text suggest that a fundamental reappraisal of the relationships between the major characters occurred shortly after composition began, while the remnants of the earlier plot suggest a development divergent from that of the definitive version. The main features of the earlier text however are not in evidence until f. 14 of the manuscript. The first five leaves present the Henchard family situation as it appears in the definitive form—that of a young couple with their only child. The most significant revisions in these opening leaves concern the husband's trade, for deletions indicate that Henchard was first depicted not as the hay-trusser of the familiar version but as a mechanic: At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket from which frotruded at one end the crutch of a hay-knifey (of tools, and from a little side pocket down his thigh) a wimble for hay bonds being also visible in the aferture (gleamed the brass joint of a two-foot rule).

(f. 5) Not until if. 14-20 do the cancellations reveal that the "mechanic" of the opening leaves is itself a replacement of earlier attempts at rep resenting the protagonist's craft. Inspection of the revisions here indi cates that if. 14-20 antedate if. 1-5 and are survivals from an earlier phase of the novel's composition. Originally numbered 12-18, the figures have been altered to read 14-20 to fit the reorganized opening of the chapter. Deletions made over Henchard's trade are much heavier than before and reveal that he was first visualized as a wood man, and then more specifically, as a sawyer. "Woodman" has in several places been altered to "workman," but there are other instances of more elaborate revision: (stone mason) "Set it higher, auctioneer," said the (woodman) (sawyer), trusser (f. 15) trusser ". . . the bargain's complete," said the (woodman) (stonemason) (f.17 ) Traces of the earlier plot are now apparent, and they reveal that the Henchard family was originally composed not of one daughter but of two j while Susan, on being sold to the sailor Richard Newson, was to take one child with her, the second remaining with the husband: if she wants to, . .

The fairly heavy revision re veals traces of an earlier phase of the plot, including evidence of the two children originally ascribed to the Henchard family (lines 20, 21), and the alteration of the husband's trade from "woodman," "sawyer," and "stone-mason," to "hay trusser" (lines 10, 17).

Henchard has just woken the morning after selling his wife, and the leaf ends with the now canceled lines: ... a rustling on his left hand caused him to turn. The girl on the bench was just opening her eyes. He rose (f. 20) At this point in the manuscript further revelation of the course of the original plot is precluded by the sequence of missing leaves (ff. 21 28), and with the next grouping of leaves the plot appears to have reached the stage of development apparent in the opening leaves. The instability of the author's notion of Henchard's craft is now less evi dent, for Elizabeth Jane asks her mother: hay trusser "He was a (stone mason), wasn't he, when you last heard of him? (f. 29) In the absence of appropriate reference within the text, however, one cannot assert with complete confidence that Hardy had at this stage dispensed with the idea of two daughters, since it is quite possible that "woodman" may have been replaced by "stone mason" (ff. 15, 17, 19) before the cancellation of the opening of Chapter I of the earlier text. That is to say, it is not possible to state conclusively whether ff. 29-32 was written before or after ff. 1-5 of the present manuscript. Further deletions in Chapters IV, V, and X indicate that the role of Richard Newson in the earlier text was not meant to extend beyond the first chapter. The sailor's death, which, in anticipation of his re appearance later in the novel, is described rather vaguely in the final form of the manuscript, was originally made quite explicit: lost to them The sailor was now (dead and buried) (f. 35) was lost Father (died) last spring. (f. 96) This assumption is confirmed by further deletions which reveal that until f. 96 at least, the Henchard of the earlier text was the real father of the now adult Elizabeth Jane:</page><page sequence="17">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of C aster bridge" 49 Susan Henchard's (Elizabeth Jane's father, and the elder woman's) husband, in law at least, sat there. ...

(f. 96) By such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had en veloped his wife and her child in . . . total obscurity. ... (f. 96) In the evolution of Henchard's trade from woodman, through me chanic, and finally to hay-trusser, the resemblance between the earliest and the last trade makes it tempting to see in the final choice of hay trusser a reversion to a craft which, in identifying the protagonist more closely with physical nature, provides a more fitting complement to the character of a man of elementary passions.17 It is also tempting to see the changes made over Elizabeth Jane's parentage and the expan sion of the role of Richard Newson serving the function not only of gratifying the reader's "love of the uncommon in human experience"18 but also of reinforcing the persistence of an ironic fate, or perhaps more accurately, of reinforcing the expression of character in terms of that fate, since it is largely through Henchard's manipulation of the truth of Elizabeth Jane's parentage—one more instance of his playing with chance—that the tragic outcome of Newson's reappearance is de termined. However, since all surviving traces of the earliest phase of the plot 17 Hardy used both earlier versions of Henchard's trade for the occupations of central figures in two later novels: in The Woodlanders, published in 1887 (though according to Florence Emily Hardy, The Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840-1928 [London 1962], p. 102, originally conceived as early as 1874), George Melbury is a timber merchant, and Giles Winterbourne, though actually in the "apple and cider trade," is closely connected with the timber business through his association with Melbury; while the eponymous hero of Jude (1896) is a stonemason. is "The real, if unavowed, purpose of fiction is to give pleasure by gratifying the love of the uncommon in human experience, mental or corporeal." (Note made in July 1881 and included in The Life of Thomas Hardy, p. 150.)</page><page sequence="18">50 Bibliographical Society of America are confined to the opening chapters of the manuscript, and since the information offered on the likely direction of the plot is insufficient to establish with any certainty an affinity between the character and fate intended for the Henchard of the earlier version with that of the pro tagonist in the final manuscript text, any attempt to assess the author's motives for reorganizing the plot must in the end be unprofitable. Section II. Chapters XII, XVIII, and XXII Further traces of an earlier text appear with the introduction and development of the Henchard-Lucetta theme in Chapters XII, XVIII, and XXII. Since these chapters present material drawn from different phases of the novel's history they are, not unexpectedly, written on sheets from two different paper stocks, with material from the earlier text heavily revised to comply with that of the later version. The Henchard-Lucetta theme is first introduced in Chapter XII. In the final form of the manuscript text this chapter contains a con versation between Henchard and Farfrae, in which the Mayor dis closes past incidents in his life—the sale of his first wife and child more than twenty years ago, and his recent marriage to Lucetta Le Sueur, undertaken in gratitude to her for having saved his life in an accident in Jersey. Lucetta is expected to arrive in Casterbridge the following evening 5 an event which Farfrae agrees to forestall by meeting her boat at Budmouth Harbour with a letter from Henchard explaining the unexpected return of the wife he had believed dead, and the consequent annulment of his more recent marriage.19 The chapter presents a fairly complex synthesis of material. Alter ations reveal that the leaves in their final form were revised on no fewer than three different occasions, and hence the surviving pages, several of which have been renumbered, present a patchwork from two different paper stocks. The opening leaves of the chapter are missing, and the last page (f. 106) before the sequence of missing leaves (ff. 107-09) has been cut just above the opening lines of what would have been Chapter XII 19 In the version submitted to the Graf hie, both the history and the outcome of Hen chard's affair with Lucetta, it may be noted, differ markedly from that of the familiar version of the text, the main lines of which were introduced in the reworking of the serial for the first book-form edition in 1886.</page><page sequence="19">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge''' 51 (such cutting being indicative of the removal of canceled material). The final numbering of the surviving leaves in this chapter is 110-16a, with 115 missing. All leaves before Chapter XII, and with three ex ceptions the seventy-six leaves following, are written on paper from Stock A. Of the leaves in Chapter XII two (112, 114) are from Stock A and the remainder (no, in, 113, 116, 116a) from Stock B. Dele tions and additions on the surviving leaves reveal several stages of composition, and the suggested order of their composition is: 112, 114, no, in, 113, 116, 116a. The evidence for assuming this order is of fered as an illustration of the different layers of revision within the manuscript, and the consequent difficulty in assessing fair copy. Folios 112 and 114 are survivals from an earlier phase of writing. These were originally consecutive leaves: 112 was previously num bered 113, and the now canceled line at the end of the leaf is completed on 114: ... it turns out she is not your wife, the first (f. 112) being alive; so ye cannot see her ... (f. 114) Further, Farfrae's name appears as "Alan" on f. 112, which assigns it to the earlier period of composition, as the appearance of "Farfrae" unrevised on ff. no, 113, and 116 assigns them to a later period. At the second stage of composition the remaining leaves—110, in, 113, 116, and 116a—were written. All occurrences of Farfrae's name appear on these leaves unrevised in its final form. Folio no has obviously been written after the leaves assigned to stage one, since it includes, or rather reiterates, Henchard's disclosure of his first wife's return, information which also appears on (the chronologically earlier) f. 112: No wife or daughter could I hear of . . . till this very day. And now— they have come back. (f. no) This morning—this very morning . . . my first wife, my real wife, returned to me. (f. 112) Folio 112 must by this time have been discarded, for ff. 111 and 113 were originally consecutive: 113 was previously numbered 112, and the now canceled sentence at the foot of one leaf is completed at the top of the next:</page><page sequence="20">52 Bibliographical Society of America No: somebody must meet her, and let her know all: so that she goes back by the same packet which returns at once. (f- I") (f- "3) The last five lines of f. 113 are left blank, the leaf having been written to precede the already composed 114. The third stage of composition includes the reintroduction of the presumably discarded f. 112, and the deletions and substitutions made on f. 111 to adapt the later written leaf to the earlier. The reason for resurrecting this leaf may well have been the author's wish to maintain the strict tone of propriety in Henchard's attitude towards his rela tionship with Lucetta, for the leaf contains a speech by Henchard in which full acceptance of his responsibility for the outcome of events, and a concern with the ethical aspects of his position, strike the pre dominant note: Now see what misery a man may lay up for himself! Even after that wrongdoing at the fair ... if I had never taken the second false step at Jersey, all might now be well. For don't you suppose I complain of losing the younger . . . woman I last married: I do no such thing: I willingly bear all that . . . but I complain of the trickery of things, whereby a perfectly fair course is made impossible. I must injure one of them, and it is the second. Honour where honour is due—my first duty is to Susan—there's no doubt about that. (f. 112) and farther on: But these two women—I feel I should like to treat them as honestly as a man can in such a case. (f. 112) The mark X at the beginning of the sentence "That account of my escape at Jersey I didn't quite complete," on f. 111 denotes a textual addition which has been written in pencil on the verso of f. 110. This recounts Henchard's accident in Jersey and subsequent rescue by Lucetta, and was presumably added when Hardy, on revising the amalgamated version, realized that the account of Henchard's escape existed by this time only on sheets either destroyed or containing in adaptable material. While the deletions on the leaves in Chapter XII appear to be rem nants of an earlier phase of the introduction of the Henchard-Lucetta</page><page sequence="21">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Caster bridge" 53 motif, there are cancellations on sheets incorporated in two later chap ters (namely, XVIII and XXII) which appear to antedate the earliest traceable stages of composition present in Chapter XII. Like the earlier chapter Chapters XVIII and XXII show evidence of the adaptation of material from different phases of the novel's com position. A canceled system of foliation at the top left-hand corner of the leaf, beginning at f. 125 and, with several exceptions, extending through to f. 215, offers valuable evidence for identifying within this area of the manuscript a still earlier phase of the Henchard-Lucetta theme. Of equal importance, the canceled foliation confirms the as sumption made earlier, that leaves from Stock A (up to f. 215 at least) differ in date from those in Stock B; for the leaves from which the canceled foliation is absent are without exception those drawn from Stock B. The correlation between the earlier system of foliation and that of the final manuscript form is represented in the table below.

Marks of alteration and adaptation are evident in the opening leaves of the chapter, and the suggested order of composition is: 165 (lines 1-15), 167, 165 (lines 16-20), 166. Folio 165 is composed of portions of two separate leaves joined to gether. This is obviously not a once complete leaf torn and then mended, since the feint lines of the lower half (the last five lines of the leaf) differ in color from those of the top half, though both are of the same paper stock. Moreover the canceled system of foliation re veals that the following leaf (166) has been inserted at a later date, and that f. 167 originally followed f. 165 (top portion). Folio 165 has been cut shortly after the beginning of the reported content of Lucetta's first recorded letter to Henchard: She said that she perceived full well how impossible it would be for any further communications to proceed between them, now that his re marriage had taken place. ("But Giles," she) [cut] (f. 165) In the affixed lines and in the leaf following, which present the text of Lucetta's letter, the writer refers to "our ill-advised marriage" (165) and requests the return of letters written to Henchard "im mediately after being sent back to Jersey when I had come to join you" (166). This accords with the text presented in Chapter XII where even the earliest composed sheets of the chapter refer to Hen</page><page sequence="23">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor oj Casterbridge" 55 chard's marriage with the woman from Jersey. Yet f. 167, which has many deletions and alterations, contains traces of a still earlier phase of the plot, revealing that the relationship between the two was origi nally conceived in terms conspicuously different from those in the final form of the manuscript. Whereas the strictest propriety in the relations between the pair is observed in the text offered to the Graphic, the survival of the earlier text on f. 167 suggests that the relationship was originally a predominantly sexual one and that no marriage had taken place: Poor thing—six years of shilly-shallying with me—engagement as she calls it! Upon my heart and life, if ever I were left in a position to take another wife she ought in justice to be you—she ought to be you! (f. 167) while further correction in the same paragraph— you saved }s life than mine! better (she) had (seen) the devil (than me) (f. 167) —suggests that the life-saving episode which eventually leads to Henchard's marriage to Lucetta belongs to a later stage in the re organization of the subplot. Further traces of the earlier text appear in Chapter XXII. Opening on f. 211, the chapter is included in that area of the manuscript written on leaves from Stock B. Survivals from the earlier text are evident on ff. 214-15, both of which are drawn from Stock A, the latter half of f. 215 having been cut, presumably because the material it contained was no longer adaptable to the later text. Further traces of the sexual nature of Henchard's relationship with Lucetta are apparent: She was in a very coming-on disposition for marriage-, of that there could be no doubt. But what else could a poor woman be who had herself to him so unluckily at first given (the freshest years of her life to him ?) ( f. 214 ) The original tone of their relationship, which the rewriting noticeably suppresses, is nicely illustrated in the following alteration: woman "The artful little (wench)! " he said smiling. (f. 214)</page><page sequence="24">56 Bibliographical Society of America The rearrangement of material in chapters of the manuscript deal ing with the introduction and development of the Henchard-Lucetta theme points to a fundamental reorganization of this aspect of the plot sometime after its original composition. It is not possible to decide at what stage in the manuscript's history this occurred, but cancellations on several scattered leaves suggest that the major revision of Chapter XII, where the Henchard-Lucetta theme is first introduced, was prob ably not undertaken until well over half the novel was completed. The evidence for this assumption may be summarized as follows. In Chapter XII, it will be remembered, Farfrae agrees to meet Lucetta at Budmouth with the explanatory letter from Henchard: No—somebody must meet her, and let her know all; so that she may go back by the packet which returns as soon as the other arrives . . . will you do me the good turn of going for me ? "Yes—I will," said Farfrae . . . (fF. 112-113) Now the verso of f. 112 carries several heavily canceled lines which comprise material from the earliest traceable phase of the subplot, and suggests that the extent of Farfrae's participation in forestalling Lucetta's arrival was originally much smaller than it appears in the final manuscript form. The deletions, which are in Emma Hardy's hand, are practically illegible, but the leaf seems originally to have been numbered 121 [ ? ] and reads as follows: In about forty minutes they were on the Quay in Budmouth Har bour. There was but a lamp or two here or there and the man who took down Miss Le Sueur's personal luggage neither suspected who had brought her, Henchard leaving her there. Hen chard drove away and stabled his horse, after which he returned on foot to the Quay. While the evidence here, as in the opening leaves of the manuscript, is too slight to make conjecture on the possible course of the earlier form of the plot a profitable task, these lines seem to indicate that at one stage in the narrative Lucetta had in fact arrived from Jersey and was escorted from Casterbridge not by Farfrae, but by Henchard him self. The assumption is confirmed still further by deletions in Chapter XVIII which suggest that Farfrae's assistance in the original form of</page><page sequence="25">Manuscript of Hardy's "Mayor of Casterbridge" 57 Chapter XII corresponded fairly closely with the text of the first edi tion. For the canceled fragment of Lucetta's letter on f. 167— which I poured out to you the sentiments of a soul as warm as ever lodged in woman's heart! Especially send the one in which I wrote what I regret—if it is not destroyed." —is followed by a parenthetical explanation: (This referred to the letter on which he [Henchard] had consulted Stansbie.) (f. 167) while the following deletion appears later in the chapter: the letters Farfrae took the bundle [of Lucetta's letters].... guessed (they) were ■property of the lady become involved with the (letters) Henchard had (spoken of) (in their friendly days) . . . (f. 170) The original conception of the Henchard-Lucetta relationship re vealed in the fragments of the earlier text thus bears a marked similar ity to the version of their relationship "rewritten" for the first edition in 1886, in which Hardy simplified the plot by removing, among other elements designed expressly for the household reader, the rami fications of Henchard's marriage with Lucetta. Nevertheless one fea ture of the original conception—the sexual element in the relation ship—remained suppressed until the publication of the first uniform edition of 1895. The absence of any historical evidence either from letters between Hardy and the editor of the Graphic or from information included in the Life of Thomas Hardy makes it impossible to identify with complete assurance the immediate cause of the changes in this area of the plot; the inducement however was undoubtedly deference to the prudery of the magazine-reading public. In the light of previous objections from family magazine editors to his candid treatment of relations between the sexes,20 Hardy may have subjected his original story to close 20 In 1874 when Hardy was writing- Far from the Madding Crowd for serialization in the Cornhill, Leslie Stephen wrote to him that the seduction of Fanny Robin would "re quire to be treated in a gingerly fashion," and asked Hardy to "excuse this wretched shred of concession to popular stupidity. . . Three years later when Hardy submitted a portion</page><page sequence="26">58 Bibliographical Society of America scrutiny and, in anticipation of difficulties ahead, have doctored the sexual element, on his own initiative. A more likely possibility is that the changes were made as a direct result of editorial pressure from the Graphic. The general appearance of the revisions on several leaves in Chapter XII suggests a hasty and at times rather perfunctory re arrangement of material. In particular, the penciled addition on the verso of f. 110, though apparently a fairly rough draft,21 nevertheless presents with very little alteration the text as it appeared in the Graphic. Certainly the general quality of the changes made here sug gests the motive to have been one of expediency rather than of critical reappraisal. of the MS. of The Return of the Native, Stephen refused to accept the story for the CornhiU without first seeing the entire novel, because "though he liked the opening, he feared that the relations between Eustacia, Wildeve, and Thomasin might develop into something 'dangerous' for a family magazine...."
