<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ardhan?risvara in Indian Iconography A New Interpretation by Ellen Goldberg In this paper I develop a typology of the diagnostic features of the image of Ardhan?risvara in Indian iconography in order to illuminate gender issues in the images' various iconographical motifs. A feminist critique of this image is necessary given the gender implications of several of its diagnostic features, and the lack of feminist analysis of this image to date in sources on Indian iconography. My overall concern is that Ardhan?risvara functions in Indian tradition as an image of liberation for men and women particularly in the context of Saiva bhakti, hathayoga, and tantra, but to the extent that the image privileges his/her male features, s/he cannot be an emancipatory ideal for women, or men, for that matter. I provide a detailed analysis of one specific image of Ardhan?risvara, the well known 9th century C?la sculpture (2) in bronze from Tiruvenkadu (Fig. 1). While general accounts of the image of Ardhan?risvara in the principal canons of Indian iconography elaborate upon a wide range of diagnostic features (3), some of those features, as I point out in this paper, privilege the male half of the divine androgyne. The C?la image of Ardhan?risvara discussed here demonstrates several of those diagnostic features quite clearly, and is therefore an excellent example to analyse. In a more detailed work (Goldberg 1995) I have looked at a broad cross section of the various ways the half male and half female god/dess (4) has been typically (*) Raju Kalidos (1993) cites the significance of Ardhan?risvara in soteriologically oriented Sanskrit works such as the Mah?bh?rata, Svet?svatara Upanisad, Matsya Pur?na, Siva Pur?na, and Tantras?rasamgraha, to mentions only a few (Kalidos 1993: 84-85). Also, Frederique Apffel Marglin in her comprehensive analysis of devad?sis in Puri, speaks of Ardhan?risvara in terms often found in secondary sources. She says that the image of Siva half-man half-woman speaks of 'the transcendence of hierarchy' (Marglin 1989: 216). She also refers here to the Oriya style of representing Radh? and Krsna. (2) Kalidos states that culture in Tamil Nadu reached its 'apogee' with Coja sculpture. See Kalidos 1988. (3) For canonical and iconographical studies of Ardhan?risvara see Kandasamy 1994; Kalidos 1993; Adiceam 1968; Banerjea 1956; Rao 1968. (4) This is a term borrowed from Rosemary Radford Reuther (1986) to capture the male and female aspects of transcendent reality equally. [1] 175</page><page sequence="2">portrayed in Indian tradition. The typology I developed from studying no less than one hundred representative images indicates that the image of Ardhan?risvara, and the tendency toward male privileging, is universal in the Indian context, and can be found in temples from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu. For this reason, a feminist analysis of this pan-Indian image is necessary. Although there is no lack of images of Ardhan?risvara in sources on Indian iconography, this image has yet to receive its recognition There are to date no systematic studies dealing with the image of Ardhan?risvara, therefore, my data must be collected from scattered sources. This paper draws primarily upon the substantial commentaries on this image as found in canonical commentaries of Indian iconography by art historians such as T.A. Gopinatha Rao (1968), J.N. Banerjea (1956), and a more recent study of Ardhan?risvara by Raju Kalidos (1993). At times, it also draws upon references from the Indian system of S?rhkhya-Yoga to elucidate the metaphysical and philosophical presuppositions behind some of the iconographical motifs (6). While my analysis of this image is indebted to these sources, as well as to the canons of Indian iconography themselves, my critique goes beyond their descriptions to demonstrate how the image, and commentaries on the image, at points, are not free of androcentrism. Here I draw upon a significant study by Sherry Ortner (1976) titled 'Is Female to Nature as Male is to Culture' to frame my argument. Before I consider the specific image of Ardhan?risvara, it is important to understand exactly what the canons of Indian iconography tell us about the traditional diagnostic features of Ardhan?risvara. While a detailed study of this topic is beyond the scope of this particular investigation, a list of the various diagnostic features of Ardhan?risvara can be found in Rao 1968, Kalidos 1993, Kandasamy 1994, and Adiceam 1968 (7). In this paper, however, I limit the examination to a feminist analysis of one representative image of Ardhan?risvara in order to point out how (5) I wish to point out that there have been no sustained works specifically on Ardhan?risvara, unlike studies, for example, on Natar?ja (Fig. 5). Excellent discussions of Natar?ja can be found in: Sivaramamurti 1974; Gaston 1982; and Smith 1996. Canonical discussions of Ardhan?risvara, and interpretative ones such as those by Indian art historians, are primarily descriptive and typically discuss the image in the wider context of Siva iconography. In the principal texts on Indian iconography, as Kalidos (1993) points out, Ardhan?risvara is considered an image of Siva. Here, Kalidos looks at typical diagnostic features from the 19th century Sritattvanidhi, and compares its consistency with other silpa texts such as K?s'yapas'ilpa-s?stra, Matsya Pur?na, etc. (6) In her study of Bharata Natyam, a south Indian style of classical dance, Anne-Marie Gaston (1982) asserts that the parallels and correspondences between the iconographic motifs and gestures of Indian sacred images and dance are mutually informing. In fact, Gaston claims that the postures of Indian classical dance to a large degree derive their origins from the iconographic styles in Indian temple art. However, Indian iconography, I would argue, in turn derives its canons from Indian religion, philosophy, and mythology. (7) Also see Rao 1968 and Banerjea 1956 for detailed descriptions of the diagnostic features of Ardhan?risvara. 176 [2]</page><page sequence="3">certain features typically found in images of Ardhan?risvara privilege the male half. I also indicate certain traditional features that are more egalitarian, and come closer to symbolizing the ideal of 'ultimate reality', and the 'transcendence of hierarchy', that Ardhan?risvara is intended to represent (Kalidos 1994: 85; Marglin 1989: 216). It is also important to mention at the outset that the image is usually portrayed as one anthropomorphic form that is half male and half female (8), as the name Ardhan?risvara (the lord/god who is half woman) suggests. Here I wish to point out that the name Ardhan?risvara does not translate as 'half-man half woman' as Marglin suggests, but rather as the 'god who is half woman*. This immediately indicates a gender hierarchy in the sense that the male/Siva half is privileged by the title 'Uvara9 (lord, jjod, master), whereas the female/P?rvati/Sakti half is simply designated by 'n?rV (woman). The name, in other words, does not convey the same status for both halves. This feature could be an indication of traditional patriarchal Hindu social values in which the male is predominant, and/or it could be the result of sectarian bias, in which case Siva dominates the goddess of the Sakta tradition. Clearly, Ardhan?risvara is a syncretic image that fuses the principle deities of the Saiva and S?kta traditions into one reconciliatory androgynous form. However, it is sometimes difficult to disentangle sectarianism from androcentrism, especially when the former could well be rooted in the later in very complex ways. Fig. 1 - Ardhan?risvara, Tiruvenkadu. (8) In aniconic form, the yoni-lingam has also come to symbolize the union of male and female, or Siva and Sakti. In an interesting illustration of a p?ncamukhalingam from Nepal (Fig. 6), dated A.D. 1045, Martin Lerner and Steven Kossak identify the face as a form of Ardhan?risvara by distinguishing the two different styles of earrings worn in the left and right ears. On the p?ncamukhalingam this face is generally portrayed as half male and half female. Other aniconic images of half-male half-female Siva-Sakti are the sriyantra, ardhacandra bindu, and references to the susumn? in the subtle physiology of hatha-yoga, to name only a few. [3] 177</page><page sequence="4">The central diagnostic feature of all known anthropomorphic Ardhan?risvara images, that is to say, the half male and half female body of the deity differentiated along a vertical axis of right side male and left side female, clearly privileges the male half (9). By placing P?rvati/Sakti on the left side and Siva on the right, her status by comparison to that of Siva's is diminished. Kalidos and Kandasamy make this point in their respective studies of several rare syncretic South Indian images of the Ardhan?risvara type in which the female/goddess, indicated by the full breast, is situated on the right. Kalidos and Kandasamy suggest that by assigning what is considered the lower or left side to P?rvati/Sakti in the Ardhan?risvara images, or Visnu in the case of the Hari-hara images, 'a deliberate attempt was made to denigrate the personalities other than Siva' (Kandasamy 1994: 494). Again, it could be argued that this is an example of sectarian rivalry rather than gender bias. However, even the alchemical and yogic traditions of India, according to a recent study by David Gordon White, give strong expression of this gender privileging in their understanding of the human body as bipolar, i.e., male and female. In this context, the lower half of the body, which would be the equivalent of the left side on the image of Ardhan?risvara, represents the female or 'inferior half (White 1996: 36). Although the ornamentation of the exemplary C?la bronze chosen here for analysis is comparatively sparse, several essential diagnostic features are evident making it consistent with alternate representations of the deity as listed in Rao, Kalidos, Kandasamy, and Adiceam. For instance, a general delineation of the diagnostic features shows the figure standing in tribhanga pose, that is to say, there are three bends, in the head (it leans to the left), torso (it leans to the right), and right leg respectively (emphasizing the fuller left hip). The bipolar body of the deity is differentiated along the traditional vertical axis into male and female, the right side is male and the left side is female. On the right/male side the image is identified by the following diagnostic features: jat?makuta, male chest, broad shoulder, two arms, with the back arm raised holding a small parasu, and clothing characteristic of a male. Of the three traditional style earrings worn by Ardhan?risvara, according to Rao, the left male side bears a simple kundala. The left/female side demonstrates the following iconographical or diagnostic features: karanda makuta (bee-hive style coiffure), different shaped left eye, female style earring, full female left breast, curved hip, slim waist, and slightly larger thigh. The lower body of the left side is characteristically draped in fabric suitable to the female half falling just above the ankle. (9) Recent studies by R. Kalidos (1993) and P. Kandasamy (1994) raise interesting questions about the one-breasted devt of Narrinai, Ananku of Cankam literature, and Kannaki images found in South India that place the female breast on the right side of the image. While these images have distinct parallels in their use of the Ardhan?risvara model, they should not be considered as images of Ardhan?risvara. 178 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Also, several diagnostic features are shared jointly by the male and female sides. They include navel (10), bracelets on the wrists, upper forearms, and ankles, neckpieces, rings, yajnopavita, mekhalas (belts), and trinetra (third eye). Of the above-mentioned diagnostic features, one of the central images in Indian iconography used to convey the androgynous aspect of Siva is that of a woman's earring on the left ear. This emblem is one of the most significant female identifiers in the wealth of Siva iconography, and can be seen not only on images of Ardhan?risvara, but also on various anthropomorphic and aniconic representations, such as p?ncamukhalinga, and figures of Natar?ja, etc., as a sign of Siva's half female nature. It is also employed in various poems from the Saiva bhakti tradition, a sacred art form that could be called 'poetic iconography' (n). Art historian Alice Boner, in her book entitled Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture, suggests that the male earring Siva wears on his right side 'denotes his Purusa-aspect', and that the female earring 'he' wears on the left side represents 'his Sakti-Prakrti-aspect' (Boner 1962: 184). This reference, which is accepted as commonplace in Indian thought, associates the male and female halves of the deity with the hierarchical and often times polarized categories masculine/spirit (purusa) and feminine/nature (prakrti). Sherry Ortner's article 'Is Female to Male as Nature is to Culture' provides an appropriate theoretical perspective from which to frame an analysis of this diagnostic feature, and the wider discussion of prakrti-purusa in Indian culture which it raises. Ortner's main hypothesis to explain what she sees as the universal devaluation of women is germane to this analysis of the concepts and symbols associated with the figure of Ardhan?risvara. Ortner maintains that the universality of female subordination can no longer be challenged; it can be discerned 'everywhere', she writes, 'in every known culture' (12) (Ortner 1976: 69). Because of this, she (10) This diagnostic feature is rarely mentioned in the commentaries on Indian iconography. (n) Indira V. Peterson's study Poems of Siva (1990) shows that the metaphors used in Tamil devotional poetry focus on a range of religious themes from Indian myth and tradition, and evoke the presence of Ardhan?risvara through imaginal convention of poetic iconography that is consistent with the canons of temple art. Indian devotional poetry draws from the storehouse of conventional images and motifs to arouse the presence of the deity in the mind of the poet and audience. For example, in the following poem we see the presence of a woman's earring on one ear immediately evoke the presence of Ardhan?risvara: 'He wears a woman's earring on one ear; / riding on his bull, / crowned with the pure white crescent moon, / his body smeared with ash from the burning-ground, / he is the thief who stole my heart' (Peterson 1990: 246). In the poem specifically titled The Lord Who Is Half Woman' we read: 'When shall I see, to my heart's delight, / the devotees who worship his feet, / the bright young crescent moon, / the body like a white lotus that he shares / with the Goddess with soft young breasts?' {ibid.: 105). (12) Ortner's essay has been the subject of much intense discussion and criticism. One notable sustained effort to test Ortner's thesis of the universality of female subordination is Peggy Reeves Sanday's Female Power and Male Dominance (1981). In this work Sanday describes counter-instances [5] 179</page><page sequence="6">recommends that each culture come to understand its own internal mechanisms of female oppression, and the cultural assumptions and social organizations that stress the inferiority of women. The main postulate that Ortner proposes in order to explain the overwhelming global subordination of women is that woman' in every culture is being identified with ? or, if you will, seems to be a symbol of ? something that every culture devalues, something that every culture defines as being of a lower order of existence than itself. Now it seems that there is only one thing that would fit that description, and that is 'nature' in the generalized sense (Ortner 1976: 72). Here, Ortner defines culture as 'the transcendence, by means of systems of thought and technology, of the natural givens of existence' (Ortner 1976: 84). Consequently, it is culture's constructed duty to assert itself over, or ' "culturalize" ? nature' (Ortner 1976: 73). If, as the title of Ortner's article suggests, female is to male as nature is to culture, then the rationale for the domination of male over female is provided in the culturally constructed dialectic between these two gendered poles. In this particular study of Ardhan?risvara, this is metaphorized in the diagnostic emblems of Siva and P?rvati's earrings, as well as other diagnostic features that signal the gendered cultural constructs of nature (pra&amp;r/z/feminine) and spirit (purusa/male). As Boner says, Ardhan?risvara evokes the presence of an icon of prakrti and purusa. In other words, the universal cultural dialectic of nature and culture (i.e., the transcendental) is projected in Indian iconography on to the dual-gendered deity Ardhan?risvara (13). This hypothesis provides a rationale to help explain the predominance of the male half in so many of the diagnostic features found in the iconography of Ardhan?risvara. For example, in the various canons of Indian iconography images of Ardhan?risvara are designated with two, three, or four arms. Typically, images that depict Ardhan?risvara with two and four arms convey a more egalitarian posture that would challenge Ortner's thesis. Even though Sanday challenges Ortner's claim that female subordination can be discerned 'in every known culture' it does not diminish the value of Ortner's theory as an account to begin to explain the female subordination of some cultures, in this case Indian culture. In her most recent book Making Gender: The Politics and Erotics of Culture (1995), Ortner herself recognizes the oversimplifications of her thesis, and the tendency toward universals. However, it is still a valuable hypothesis for this analysis. (13) We see, for example, in the classical system of S?mkhya that prakrti refers to nature and the conglomeration of our physical body and mind which must either be annihilated or isolated to attain emancipation. According to the K?rik?s, the function or purpose of prakrti is to serve purusa (Larson 1969: 203). Similarly, Vy?sa's commentary on the final aphorism of the Yogas?tras states that once liberation is attained, the gunas, i.e., the primary manifestations of prakrti, 'have no further service to render to Purusha' (Aranya 1983: 406). In other words, nature's sole purpose is to serve spirit in its quest for liberation. 180 [6]</page><page sequence="7">(Fig. 2) (14). In the three-armed images, such as the C?la bronze figured here, the privileging seems more overt. In her commentary on this work, Nicole Balbir suggests that the asymmetry of the three-armed C?la bronze contributes to the work's beauty (Sivaramamurti 1974: 79). However, I would argue that this apparent absence of symmetry actually places the power of the deity, usually indicated in Indian iconography and mythology by additional arms, on its right/male side. This feature exhibits in anthropomorphic form what is clearly indicated by the name 'Ardhan?risvara', that is to say, the male half is isvara, and the female half is nari. In the C?la image of Ardhan?risvara (Fig. 1), the male and female eyes differ slightly in their shape. A full third eye (trinetra) is situated directly in the middle of the forehead, and is shared by both the male and female sides. This latter diagnostic feature is not always evident as such, and is a recognition of divine wisdom emanating equally from both the male and female sides of the deity. Iconographical variations on this theme include a half third eye on the right male side and a dot on the female side (Fig. 2), or a full third eye in the middle of the forehead and a dot situated directly below (Fig. 3) (15). The dot, when indicated, clearly refers to the marital status of the female half as the wife of Siva, whereas the third eye on the right side, shown in Fig. 2, attests to Siva's divinity or transcendence as isvara. If any mark is to be discerned on Siva's male half, whether common to both sides or not, it is the mark of divine wisdom, or in some instances the mark of ashes collected from various funeral pyres signifying the yogi par excellence who, donning the snake around his (14) This two-armed image of Ardhan?risvara from the 11th century A.D. Rajasthan stands in samap?dasth?naka pose, leaning neither to the left or to the right. Two attendants accompany the deity, a male on the right and a female on the left, carved in equal proportion, and several secondary figures can be seen as well. Several strands of jewels adorn the neck of the composite deity, upper arms, as well as a single bracelet around each wrist. This example of a two-armed Ardhan?risvara, holds the following emblems: trisula in the right hand and a nilotpala flower in the left. The body of the female side is denoted by the female left breast. The voluptuous contours of the female hip and waistline are noticeably absent, lending the image symmetry and balance. Earrings are differentiated into male and female styles, and the trinetra and dot are clearly discernible on the male and female sides respectively. (15) Figure 3 displays the animated quality of Hindu poster art from Bombay. Reproduced here in black and white, the original poster captures the striking differences between Siva's male and female sides in vivid colours. The image is divided vertically into male and female. The right male side is identified by jat?makuta, rudr?ksam?l?, two arms with the lower right arm raised in abhayamudr? (gesture of fearlessness), two-sided drum, serpent, axe, and Nandin. There are also several unique features in this illustration. The male and female sides are demarcated by their contrasting complexions, the male half is blue and the female half is golden. The image is contextualized against a Him?l?yan backdrop depicting Mount Kail?sa. Also, a luminous prabh?mandala shines in equal proportion behind the unified head of Ardhan?risvara as Gang? flows out of the top right side adorned with a crescent moon. The female half dons elaborate headdress, sari, and jewels befitting the wife of Siva. In her upper left arm she carries a nilotpala flower. She is accompanied by a lion. The third eye is located above the dot in the centre of the forehead. [7] 181</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 2 - Ardhan?risvara, Rajasthan. neck as the image often shows (Fig. 3), appears to have transcended worldly sexual life, or, in other words, prakrti. Hence the type and location of the markings on the forehead of the image can be a subtle form of privileging. Although in Fig. 2 two arms are an indication of egalitarianism, the forehead markings indicate a subtle difference in status, i.e., lord and wife, just as the name Ardhan?risvara implies. The diagnostic feature of the snake (16), not found on the C?la bronze, is referred to in the canons of Indian iconography, and is evident on many well-known temple images of Ardhan?risvara, e.g., Badami, Mahabalipuram, and so on (Fig. 4). The Ardhan?risvara Stotray which sings a song of praise to the deity, presents the female (16) The snake motif is associated with Siva in Indian tradition from the earliest times, and is usually shown as an ornament in the hair, as a bracelet, around the ankle or neck, or as a sacred thread. However, the snake ornament is also a sign of kundalini (Sakti). Awakening kundalini and so on, is the aim of yoga, i.e., union of Siva-Sakti. Generally, intense tapas is required to facilitate this experience. Tantric literature generally conceives reality as the interplay of Siva and Sakti in one body. 182 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 4 - Ardhan?risvara, Bad?mi, Cave I. Fig. 5 - Ardhan?risvara, South India. side of Ardhan?risvara with 'tinkling anklets and bracelets', and the male side with 'shining anklets of snakes' (17). An alternative to the snake motif also referred to in the Ardhan?risvara Stotra is a m?l? of skulls. Verse 5 of the Ardhan?risvara Stotra says: mand?ram?l?kulit?lakayai j kapalam?l?nkitak?dhar?ya (she is wearing a m?l? made from the mand?r tree in her hair, / he is wearing a m?l? of skulls on his neck). What is significant about these motifs is the implicit reference here to Siva as Adinath, the lord of yoga. Sakti (referred to as Siv? in the stotra) is associated typically with manifestations of prakrti (i.e., creation), such as campa flowers, musk-vermilion, tinkling sounds, lotuses, an extraordinary dress, and l?sya (the dance of creation) (18). Siva is associated with the images of renunciation, transcendence, yoga, and dissolution, (17) Verse 3 says: calat-kvanat-kankanan?pur?yai / p?d?bjar?jataphanin?pur?ya / hem?ngad?yai bhuja g?ngadaya / namah Siv?yai ca namah ?iv?ya. (18) Gaston clearly distinguishes Siva's vigorous masculine dance (t?ndava) from his/her tender feminine dance (l?sya). Gaston says that Ardhan?risvara is 'the most literal expression of the interplay of the male ipurusa) and female (Sakti) elements in the cosmic cycle'. As in temple iconography, Indian dance delineates the left side as P?rvati (l?sya) and the right side as Siva (t?ndava). In the context of the dance, however, a handkerchief divides the face of Ardhan?risvara. Gaston says, 'When the dancer performs l?sya, as exemplified by P?rvati, the feminine half of the face is uncovered and for the t?ndava or vigorous dance, the Siva half of the face is exposed' (Gaston 1982: 139). [9] 183</page><page sequence="10">such as ashes, snakes, skulls, digarhbara, and t?ndava (the dance of destruction). In other words, Siv? is portrayed as prakrti, and Siva is portrayed as ntvrtti or yoga. Siva/?'s dual creative and destructive nature, then, is personified in his/her male and female sides. However, in a culture that privileges self-realization, transcendence, and liberation (i.e., moksa), the power is placed on the right male side. Hence, the stotra, as well as the canons of Hindu temple iconography, convey prescribed cultural values that fortify the devaluation of the feminine/goddess in Indian culture (19), and, in turn, privilege the male side of the divine androgyne. As I have mentioned, there are numerous identifying diagnostic features of the composite image of Ardhan?risvara outlined in the canons of Indian iconography (Kalidos 1993; Kandasamy 1994; Adiceam 1968; Rao 1968; Banerjea 1956). However, I would argue that the only consistent features that distinguish this image as an Ardhan?risvara ('the lord/god who is half woman') are the various markings of the female body. The female earring on the left ear, the dot placed strategically on the forehead, as well as the female left breast, full hip, and slim waist, immediately identify this image as Ardhan?risvara. Salient and distinguishing features of Siva iconography, such as jat?makuta, trident, parasu, trinetra, crescent moon, trisula, Nandin, and so on, are abundantly featured on various representations of the image of Siva; yet, when those identifying marks are juxtaposed with those of the female, Siva is at once recognizable as Ardhan?risvara. In other words, unless the female half of the deity is made explicit, Siva is figured as male. The prescriptive insignia for the iconography of Ardhan?risvara, then, is the female form. This is not to discount the importance of the other frequently occurring secondary features, but only to say that without the presence of the vertical division identifying the female left half by the left breast, female torso, earring, etc., these secondary features, on their own, cannot firmly establish an image as Ardhan?risvara. Hence, Siva's female nature may be implicit in other aspects, as Sivaramamurti explains, but is explicit only in the Ardhan?risvara form. In this sense, Ardhan?risvara is androcentric. The assumption in androcentrism is that the male is the norm; if the female is identified at all, she must be specified from this assumed male norm (20). The image of Ardhan?risvara is identified (19) Recent studies on women in India discuss the challenge of issues such as dowry, abuse, widowhood, inheritance, sati, female infanticide, divorce, modernity, development, Indian feminism, spirituality, the goddess, and so on. Excellent works on these subjects, such as Leslie 1989; Sarkar &amp; Butalia 1995; Guha 1984; Hawley 1994; Wadley &amp; Jacobson 1992; Ray 1995; Ramaswamy 1997; Harlan &amp; Courtright 1995, and Manushi: A Journal about Women and Society, to name just a few, indicate the overwhelming marginalization of women in Indian culture. (20) In Buddhism after Patriarchy (1993), Rita Gross explains what she means by the term 'androcentrism' by referring to the following statement: The Egyptians allow (or don't allow) women to [...]' (Gross 1993: 294). Because such a statement is so common, it is hard to notice the inaccurate assumptions contained within it. The statement assumes that all Egyptians are men; women are merely objects of the male Egyptian actors. 184 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 6 - Piicamukhalifigam, Nepal. specifically by the image's female indicators. The god, that is to say Siva, is normatively perceived as male and the aspects that bring out his androgynous nature need to be identified as female, thus assuming that the male is the norm and the female is the exception (21). (21) Still, it is important to mention that anthropomorphic images such as Ardhanarivara are complex. Situating the female body along side the male can be discerned as having empowering and egaliarian tendencies, as well as dominating ones. Clearly, the god/dess dwells inside the practitioner, in both his/her male and female form. In this sense, the feminine embodiment of the divine can be seen as empowering for women and men. Christian feminist theologians, such as Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza (1989) and Rosemary Radford Reuther (1983), protest the exclusive masculine symbolism to proclaim a vision of god. They argue that rendering the image of god as male provides the justification [11] 185</page><page sequence="12">In sum, specific diagnostic features found in the canons of Indian iconography, such as right side male, status as isvara, associations with purusa vis-?-vis prakrti, and so on, place prominence or privilege on the right/male side. Hence an analysis of the gender implications of certain diagnostic features is necessary. Here, I have only begun to point out some of the possible gendered meanings of the diagnostic features found on images of Ardhan?risvara by using Ortner's thesis of female subordination to explain how such a privileging could come about. One possible explanation lies in the wider debate between nature and culture, and the ways these concepts are gendered in any particular cultural context. As such, an analysis of sacred images, such as Ardhan?risvara, which derive from metaphysical and ideological paradigms such as prakrti-purusa, pravrtti-nivrtti, etc., begins to expose the complex issue of gender myth-making that is evident in the composite male and female image discussed in this paper. Rather than continue the posture of egalitarianism thought to be portrayed in this imagery (22), instances of male dominance in the dual-gendered androgyne must be acknowledged and named in Indian textual materials, whether they are found in poetry, iconography, mythology, treatises on praxis, and so on. With each new reading of the androgyne in these various cultural institutions, like the illustrations of the diagnostic features provided above, indications that this two-sexed model of humanity that has been credited with the discourse of human emancipation, can be questioned. for the oppression and marginalization of women in Christianity. Some might propose that the gender inclusiveness of an androgynous divine offers a first step in the struggle against the exclusion and devaluation of women in the Church. However, if the image of a two-sexed model of the transcendent functions to privilege its male half, then the underpinnings of patriarchy are just as evident. (22) If anything this image has been used to idealize female/male equality. To illustrate my point, Swami Ghanananda of the Ramakrishna Order of India writes in his introduction to the spiritual tradition among Hindu women that '[no] other scriptures of the world have ever given to woman such equality with man as the Vedas of the Hindus' (Ghanananda 1956: 14). Ghanananda qualifies this statement on the basis of the androgynous nature of God in which the 'Lord' divides 'his' self into two halves, one male and one female. This divine creative act, according to Ghanananda, legitimates the fundamental equality between women and men in Hindu religion. Ghanananda cites the following passages from the Rg Veda, 5.61.8, and Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, 1.4.13 to support his point. However, Ghanananda does not see the inherent contradiction in the image itself, that is to say, an androcentric androgyne cannot be a liberating symbol for women (or men, for that matter). The problem from a feminist analysis is not that the image is male and female, but rather what male and female, in the particular patriarchal society from which the symbol arose, mean. 186 [12]</page><page sequence="13">REFERENCES Adiceam, M.E.
