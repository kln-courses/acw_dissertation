<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAHIENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS A SKETCH OF THE ARAB INVASION OF IFRIKIYA IN THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE HIJRA By FRANCIS RODD ITHIN twenty year* of the flight of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, and only ten years after his death, the recently persecuted adherents of the new Faith embarked on a series of conquests which distinguish the spread of Islam as one of the most important, if not the most important, historical period of the last two thousand years. The conquest of Egypt by the Khalifa Omar was hardly complete in A.D. 641, when the Arabs turned westward along the southern shore of the Mediterranean and became involved in a series of adventures which were destined to menace Europe at a most critical time in its history. The people of Arabia had begun to make another bid for world power which the European branches of Western Man eventually achieved, at their expense. The Arab invasions of the North African littoral, though perhaps less known, are not less important than the parallel movements which were in progress along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean at the same period. It is sometimes forgotten that the credit which Europe has given to the Crusaders for their actions in Syria is not wholly justified; it was not by them alone that the Muslimin were held in check. We owe a greater measure of gratitude to the inhabitants of North Africa for their vigorous opposition in the first century of the Hijra; the failure of the Arabs in Tunisia and Algeria at this time contributed directly to the success of the crusades which encountered them after the first glow of religious enthusiasm had passed away and Europe was in a better position to withstand their advance. The origin of the people of North Africa is so disputed that it would be out of place even to indicate the many theories which are current. They have been called Northern Hamites, or a branch of the Mediterranean Race, or simply Libyans. They are not Semitic in the ordinary sense of the word, though their original home may be sought in the east, unless the view is accepted that the cradle of their race was in Africa itself. Their own historians, basing themselves</page><page sequence="2">730 FRANCIS RODD-- on traditions current among the people, refer to a migration into Africa from Syria; while this may be correct, it would be a mistake to follow them in placing such an event in historical times. The parts in which the Berbers, as these people are usually called, survive in the purest state are more especially to the west of Tunisia. In the centre of the littoral they have been much more in contact with foreign races ever since their first arrival. The Carthaginians established colonies only along the coast, but their historical suc- cessors, the Romans, penetrated into the interior. The latter remained at variance with the Berbers throughout their ogcupation; they did not so much conquer the countries of North Africa, as establish a modus vivendi, disturbed by interludes like the Jugurthine wars. The Berbers appear to have retained their own tribal administration under the supervision of military posts interspersed with civic " colonike " which sprang up to contain the mixed population and foreign immigrants. In the early part of the fifth century A.D. the Vandals of Gaiseric arrived to complicate the ethnology of the country, and finally Belisarius came with a Byzantine Army to reconquer it. Under the Emperor Heraclius, many Berbers are said to have adopted some form of Christianity. They had already for some time previously become accustomed to absorb certain elements of the various civilizations with which they had come into contact. One of their most interesting characteristics has always been the faculty for retaining extraneous influences withouit allowing them to detract from, or enfeeble, their own national traits. Much of the art and architecture of North Africa, and for that matter of Spain as well, is not Arab, but Berber evolved under the influence of Islam. In the course of the campaigns which followed one another in rapid succession during the seventh and eighth centuries A.D., it was the Berbers who absorbed the Arabs, and not vice versa, as so many people have assumed. A study of the influences which went to make up the so-called Arab civilization more especially in the West would go far to show how little, apart from the- energy and vitality then inherent in Islam, did the conquerors really contribute. Moreover, it was only much later than the period referred to, that the Arabs became sufficiently numerous in North Africa to have any effect on the racial type in these countries. In the 22nd or 23rd years after the Flight of Muhammad, corre- sponding approximately to the year A.D. 642, Ibn el Asi set out from Egypt for Tripoli. Barca, which is known to-day as Cyrenaica,</page><page sequence="3">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 731 a name in classical times applied only to one part of the country near the town of Cyrene, had been occupied by the Arabs in the preceding year. Cyrene was pillaged for the second time in twenty-five years. Its capture in 616 by Chosroes the Persian in the course of his wars against the Byzantine Empire, and the devastation of what in classical times had been a prosperous country, contributed to the ease with which the Arabs were able to undertake the invasion of Africa beyond the Nile. Had the subsequent revolts of the Berbers against the Arabs taken the form of organized resistance in Barca as early as 641 or 642, the burden of the fighting would have fallen to a lesser extent on the people of the West. The early effects of the Arab move- ment would have been proportionately weakened, and if the nearness to complete success achieved by the later campaigns of Koseila and Kahena be considered, the subsequent development of Islam might have been very different. Speculation on the " might-have-beens" of history, however, is an idle pastime. Ibn el Asi captured Tripoli and the hieighbouring important town of Sabratha, which is near the modern village of Agilat, a few miles further west along the coast. Tunisia was at this time known as Ifrikiva; it was inhabited by Berbers and Franks, which is the best name for the people whom the Arabs called Rumi. The changing significance of the latter word is curious. The Byzantine Empire styled itself " Roman ", as the Greek orthodox Church in the East sometimes still affects to do. But contrasted with the Empire of the West, Byzantium was Greek rather than Latin. When the Muslimin conquered Syria they referred to their enemies as Rumi, from the name which they knew the latter applied to themselves. Thus, after meaning " Roman" the word in Arabic came to have the sense of "Greek ". It is still used in this sense, though the term Levantine would now be more nearly its equivalent. When the Arabs reached Tunisia they called all the non-Berber people there Rumi, as their friends had named the non-Semitic elements in Syria; yet in North Africa the people in question were probably more Latin than Greek; in order to avoid confusion they are therefore best called Franks. The Berbers and Franks of Ifrikiya were living in unhappy relation- ship under the rule of a Byzantine adventurer, or more properly speaking, traitor, by name Count Gregory, who had seceded from his government, and assumed the Purple. He had set up his capital at Sufetula, a site, known to-day as Sbeitla, and marked by the ruins</page><page sequence="4">732 FRANCIS RODD- of a Roman town, in whose previous history the only noteworthy fact which is recorded, is that it achieved the civic distinction of becoming a " colonia " after being a " municipium ". The Arabs under Ibn el Asi joined battle with the Franks and Berbers, most probably in the neighbourhood of the town. They were completely victorious; Count Gregory was killed and his daughter fell as a prize of war to Ibn el Asi. In a vain attempt to pacify the country the conqueror offered the Berbers favourable terms and proceeded to occupy the land which appeared to have been most successfully reduced. In A.H. 34 Muawiya ibn Hodeij set out to conquer Maghreb el Aksa, or the " Furthest West ", including what are now certain parts of Algeria as well as Morocco. He disputes with his successor Okba the claim to have founded Kairuan. Lack of information regarding Muawiya's exploits, taken in conjunction with the information that only eleven years later was a " serious attempt " made to annex the West, appear to show how little the first campaign in this direction achieved. The enterprise must have been far from happy. Revolts broke out behind his back among the Berbers, and one of their chiefs, Ibn Abi Yezid, at this juncture commenced his brilliant career of no less than twelve apostasies from Islam whenever a propitious moment presented itself in Maghreb or Ifrikiya. For in these days to embrace Islam was a sign of submission to the conquerors; to deny the Prophet signified rebellion, independence, and freedom. Ibn Abi Yezid was only finally " converted " under the Emirate of Musa Ibn Noseir, some thirty years later. Internal dissensions among the Arabs prevented any serious steps being taken to restore the situation until A.H. 45 or 46, when Muawiya ibn Hodeij was appointed Emir of Ifrikiya and a large expedition was dispatched from Egypt under Okba ibn Nafe' to extend the conquests of the Arabs along the southern shore of the Mediterranean in a more definite manner than had hitherto been attempted. On his way to Ifrikiya, Okba made a very remarkable expedition from Cyrenaica into the Fezzan on the borders of the Central Deserts to the south of Tripolitania. Not only did he succeed in reducing the country in the face of the almost unsurmountable military obstacles presented by the desert nature of the area, but he also penetrated a long way down the important caravan road, which runs from Cyrenaica and Tripoli to Lake Chad; he reached the Kawar oases in the twentieth degree of northern latitude. Rejoining his army which had been left in charge of Zoheir ibn Kais, Okba installed</page><page sequence="5">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 733 Muawiya in office as Viceroy of Ifrikiya and marched into the Maghreb. He defeated the combined forces of the Franks and Berbers in the " sea province of Edjem " despite the assistance rendered to them by a fleet which had been sent from Constantinople to support the Christians. Returning to Ifrikiya, in about 50 A.H. Okba assumed the Emirate of North Africa himself, and set up his capital at Kairuan. If he did not actually found the city, he was at least responsible for raising it to be the principal centre of the West, a position which it retained until the great Berber cities of Morocco began to dispute its pre- eminence several centuries later. Kairuan is graced by some of the finest examples of North African Moslem architecture. The Great Mosque with its arcaded court facing the many pillared shrine con- structed from the loot of Roman temples, dates from the-Aglabite Dynasty of the third century of the Hijra (ninth century A.D.). But the name by which it is known, The Mosque of My Lord Okba, perpetuates the memory of the great Arab leader, who had dedicated a simple prayer enclosure on the site. The other notable monuments of Kairuan also represent later achievements of the Berbers created under the influence of Islam. The Arabs of the seventh century had but little to teach them, for, if the few who retained some traces of eastern civilizations such as the Yemenite, be excepted, they were mainly simple nomads of Western Arabia. Despite the mis- leading association of words, the Arabs were more barbarian than the Berbers. The definite split between the Franks and the Berbers dates from the conclusion of Okba's first campaign in the west. The Berbers returned to their fields and villages, the Franks to their parasitic life in the " strong places " which had not yet been occupied by the Arabs. It was no doubt the normal state of affairs which had prevailed in the land before the arrival of the Arab invaders. The respite was not destined to survive for long the appointment of Abu el Muhajer as Emir of Africa in A.H. 55. Wearied of their association with the Franks, the Berbers began to take their own part under a leader of their own race, named Koseila, the son of Lemnezm, chief of the Aureba and Beranes divisions of the people. Both Koseila and his Lieutenant, Sekerdid ibn Rumi ibn Mazet, like most of their folk, were originally Christians; only the Tuareg or Veiled People of the Desert, who are usually, but perhaps wrongly, also regarded as Berbers, were reputed to be still heathen, though the statement is</page><page sequence="6">734 FRANCIS RODD- considered doubtful by certain modern authorities. Koseila and Sekerdid had been obliged by Okba to embrace Islam; their con- version only lasted until the advent of a propitious moment when they revolted against the Emir Abu el Muhajer and renounced the faith of their enemies. Their insurrection was partially checked by the defeat and capture of Koseila at Tlemcen in Algeria. Coupled with the widespread disaffection throughout the country and the activities of Ibn Abi Yezid, who needless to say had also taken the opportunity of denouncing Islam, the rising was nevertheless sufficient to bring about the fall of the Emir. The Khalifa considered that he had not displayed sufficient energy. The situation, indeed, became so serious that in A.H. 62 he was replaced as Viceroy by Okba, who was obliged to set about reconquering the land afresh. In his second term of- office Okba was again successful. He nearly met with disaster in the Atlas Mountains, but defeated the Berbers and Franks under Count Julian. He recommenced to convert, or in other words, to subjugate, the inhabitants wherever he went. Okba reached the furthest limits of the country where the deserts begin, and there undertook a rapid expedition against the Tuareg in an area called Sus between the Atlas and Anti-Atlas, followed by a second raid into the Messufa country to the south of Morocco, now called Mauretania by the French. The two expeditions are very interesting. In the first place they indicate the presence of the Tuareg in a district which is very much further north than the deserts over which they now roam, thereby confirming their own traditions of a gradual migration from the Mediterranean into the Central Sahara : and in the second place they show how well Okba understood the military necessity of not leaving unconquered raiders and hostile but intangible groups of people on the borders of settled countries. And this, if anyone should be sufficiently interested to examine the question, is the ultimate reason why the French in modern times have had to penetrate further and further into the desert as a result of their military occupation of Southern Algeria and Morocco, until they have ended by occupying the whole of the Sahara. " Trans- Saharan trade" and "the responsibilities of a civilized people to administer the nomads of the desert " are romantic fictions invented by politicians to pacify their electors. Such a solution of the problem must have appealed as little to Okba in the seventh century as it does to-day to those Frenchmen who have experience of the con- ditions prevailing in this economically useless area.</page><page sequence="7">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 735 Since his defeat at Tlemcen by Abu el Muhajer, Koseila had been kept a prisoner by the Arabs. He seems to have been held as a hostage for the good behaviour of his people and of the Berber auxiliaries whom the Arabs were using in their western campaigns. For more than seven years Okba kept Koseila near his own person " treating him with every indignity "; and Koseila bided his time and bowed his head as so many Tuareg and Berbers have done since his day. But he neither forgave nor submitted; he remained in continuous communication with his own tribes and reported all Okba's movements which were closely followed and watched. So successfully and secretly was the work done, that in spite of the lessons which Abu el Muhajer's misplaced leniency should have taught them, the suspicions of the Arabs were allayed. Returning from the Sus and Messufa expeditions, Okba sent the bulk of his army back to Kairuan and remained behind with only a small retinue to proceed at a more leisurely pace on what would now be termed an administrative inspection of the occupied territories. But the country was still hostile, and Koseila and his people leaped at the opportunity to rebel. Okba was ambushed hurrying back to Kairuan. He was killed with his followers at Tehuda, and Koseila reigned over North Africa in his stead. As soon as news of the disaster reached Kairuan, Zoheir ibn Kais, who had been Okba's lieutenant since the early days, precipitately abandoned the capital, leaving the place free for Koseila. Zoheir fled to Barca with a panic-stricken army and there awaited reinforce- ments from Egypt. To have spread with such rapidity, the revolt must have been well prepared during all the years of Koseila's captivity. It inspired terror among the Arabs: Koseila's treatment of them, however, was remarkable for its magnanimity. He pardoned all those who had fought against him and it may be presumed did not force them in retaliation to become Christians. He is said to have established his position firmly in a very short time and to have ruled with wisdom and authority over an area extending certainly as far west as Central Morocco and perhaps to the Atlantic, and including in all probability Tripolitania in the east since Zoheir had found it necessary to retreat as far as Cyrenaica. Koseila's policy contrasted so favourably with the treatment he had experienced at the hands of Okba, that when five years later he was again fighting for his life, the Franks threw in their lot with him and even accepted him as their leader. VOL. III, PART IV. 48</page><page sequence="8">736 FRANCIS RODD- Okba had only reigned a year when he was killed in A.H. 63. Internal strife among the Arabs in the east and the situation con- sequent upon the murder of the Khalifa Muawiya in Syria made it impossible for any assistance to be sent to Zoheir until A.H. 67 when the new Khalifa Abd el Melek commissioned him to avenge Okba and provided him with the necessary reinforcements. Zoheir re-entered Ifrikiya and the Arabs and Berbers met at Mems near Kairuan, where a great battle ensued. 'After severe fighting, the Berbers were driven back and Koseila was killed: The remnants of his army broke in flight and were pursued as far as the valley of the Moluwiya in Morocco. With the destruction of the flower of the Berber army, the influence of the Franks was also broken; henceforth they only play a minor part in the history of North Africa. Zoheir had hardly turned his back on Ifrikiya in order to chastise the heathen of Barca from whom he had experienced trouble during his sojourn there with depleted forces after his evacuation of Kairuan four years previously, when the Berbers of the west, hearing that he had been killed in the course of these operations, once again broke out, in spite of the loss of their leaders and the absence of any organiza- tion. The Khalifa Abd el Melek thereupon appointed Hassan ibn Noman, the Governor of Egypt, to take the place of Zoheir and directed him-it becomes monotonous through constant repetition- to reconquer Ifrikiya. It was the fifth attempt in less than fifty years. The dating of events now becomes somewhat confused on account of the efforts of Arab writers to crowd the history of the next few years into as brief a space as possible. According to El Bekri, Hassan set out from Egypt in A.H. 68, or in 69 according to Ibn Khaldun. Ibn el Athis gives 74 as the date, while another author gives A.H. 78; Ibn Abd el Hakim states that it occurred in 76 or 77. The date, as will be seen, is of. some importance: on the whole, 68 or 69 is the most probable year. The later dates which have been mentioned no doubt refer to events in the subsequent part of Hassan's campaigns when he re-entered Ifrikiya for the second time. The effect, if they were applied to the initial expedition from Egypt, would be to make the protagonist of the Berbers too old to have played the part for which this story is remarkable. Hassan ibn Noman marched into Ifrikiya by the traditional road along the coast from Tripoli and, after some fighting, captured Kairuan and Carthage by assault. The Berbers had not recovered from the disorganization which had set in after the death of Koseila.</page><page sequence="9">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 737 The early Arab successes had the effect of driving the Franks, dis- heartened by the defeats of Mems and the Moluiya two years before, out of Africa altogether to find new homes in Sicily and in Spain. They did not, however, all depart as Ibn Khaldun states, for some of them are again heard of a few years later playing a most unsavoury part; but they must have been emigrating throughout this period in increasing numbers. Following the example of his predecessors, Hassan set out for the West as soon as he had dealt with Ifrikiya. He had made inquiries with a view to ascertain the most prominent Berber chief from whom, or around whose person, resistance might be expected. Having anticipated serious difficulties in his reconquest, he had been surprised to encounter so little opposition due, apparently, to the absence of any personage fitted to fill Koseila's place. He was astounded to learn that the robe of authority of paramount chief of the Berbers had fallen on the unwilling shoulders of a woman. The whole period following the defeat and death of Koseila had been very disheartening for the Berbers. Their prompt rebellion after Zoheir met his death in Barca had been rather futile and had not damaged the Arabs ; the rapid reconquest of Kairuan and the manner in which the Franks had given up the struggle made many hesitate to resume hostilities. But a woman conceived it to be her duty at this most critical period to attempt what no man was willing to risk. And so it came to pass that the Queen Kahena stepped down into the arena and took up the challenge of Hassan ibn Noman. In Algeria to the south of the tourist ridden Biskra and Timgad lies a mass of mountains with peaks higher than 7,000 feet. Deep narrow valleys divide the massif into parallel crests, like the ridges and folds of a piece of stuff that has been pulled from opposite corners. There is every gradation of vegetation from cedars on the hills to groves of date palms in the valleys. To the south of the mountains lies the desert. In this limestone group which is called the Aures lie the homes of perhaps the most interesting of all the Berbers. Their constant wars and love of independence have driven them to build villages on inaccessible cliffs, with places of refuge and grain stores on the remotest and most inaccessible crags. The French entered the country in 1845, but the tribes, true to their traditions, continued to give trouble for five years until reprisals were taken by the destruction of Nara on the Wadi Abter. The unequal struggle did not even end there, and further military operations were necessary in 1859 and again in 1879.</page><page sequence="10">738 FRANCIS RODD- These curious people are among the purest of the Berbers. By a trait in their character, common but less pronounced in other branches of the race, they acquired, and are almost the last people to retain, some knowledge of Arab science. But not uninfluenced by the culture of others, they kept their own ideals. The civilization of Rome, for instance, permeated them sufficiently for a number of Latin words, including the names of the months, to survive in their dialect. Even their later association with Islam did not efface these recollections. The instruments which they possess and the medical operations which they perform, especially'those connected with trepanning the skull, have attracted considerable attention. Their skill is as remark- able as is the survival of knowledge at so distant a date from the time when the Arabs, who have long since forgotten it, were practising the art. Among the Aures Berbers, the faculty of learning from others more fortunately situated than themselves, and at the same time their jealous maintenance of freedom and independence are intensely interesting in combination with one another. Their receptiveness and retentiveness render it probable that at the time of Hassan ibn Noman's campaign they were possessed of a certain degree of Roman culture. It is interesting to consider the value of Ibn Khaldun's statement that the noblest tribes of the Aures people, the Jerawa, professed the Jewish faith, whereas the other Berbers of North Africa were Christians. Christianity here as elsewhere during this period was not of the purest. The Donatist dispute had given rise to many struggles; in so far as the Berbers were concerned it represented a nationalist rather than a religious movement. Heterodoxy among them became an expression of the desire to be rid of the Byzantines, of the influence, in other words, of foreigners who had come from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean to a land already inhabited by a conscious national entity. It is curious that when the Berbers eventually for better or for worse accepted Islam, many of them continued to manifest their independence by practising the Abadite heresy; from being heterodox Christians they became heterodox Moslems. This was especially the case in the Tripolitan mountains where the Donatist persuasion had formerly been particularly prevalent. That the Berbers should have adopted Christianity seems natural in so receptive a people with no alternative between paganism in a crude form and this religion, or some type of Greek philosophy</page><page sequence="11">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 739 for which they were temperamentally unsuited. The statement, however, that a non-Semitic people became converted to Judaism needs much evidence to be convincing. Judaism is a profoundly nationalist religion, but nationalist for the Jews in particular, or at the most for the Semites in general, and not for the Berbers. The point hardly requires labouring. Among this people the statement made by Ibn Khaldun probably does not mean more than that the Jerawa had adopted some form of monotheism. In the light of their history it is inconceivable that this people should have worshipped the Lord God of Israel-the One True God they may have come to believe in, but not under the name of the Lord Jehovah. The Berber historians explain the Judaism of the Jerawa by the traditional migration of the whole race from Syria at a time coeval with Goliath, who had been one of their kings; they parted company from the Philistines and the Canaanites to found new homes in Africa. The empiric ethnology of Ibn Khaldun, however, hardly stands the test of serious inquiry. The origin of the Libyans may, and perhaps must be looked for in the east, unless we are prepared to accept the view that the Sahara was the cradle of the race. But if they came to Africa from that direction the movement must have taken place at a time considerably anterior to the evolution of anthropomorphic monotheism as a religious conception in Syria or Arabia; and even if the Jerawa did in fact belong to the Jewish faith, it is unnecessary to presuppose an ethnological connexion with Syria at a comparatively recent date, when contact with the very ancient Jewish agricultural colonies all over North Africa is sufficient to explain the phenomenon. The origin of the latter would form the subject of a very interesting study, but the question is too complicated to discuss in this essay. It seems easier to assume that the Jerawa, instead of becoming Christians with all their heresies and schisms, simply adopted a mono- theistic belief in the place of the more primitive creeds which they had outgrown. It would be more pertinent to consider whether their monotheism was of local growth or indirectly due to the spread of such beliefs from the east. The woman who took up the challenge of Hassan ibn Noman was known to the Arabs as Dihyat el Kahena. She was the daughter of Tabeta, the son of Tifan of the Jerawa tribe, which had always provided the kings of the Abter division, one of the two main divisions of the Berbers in Ifrikiya. When Hassan marched out against her on his way to reconquer the west, he found the Queen ready. She</page><page sequence="12">740 FRANCIS RODD-- did not await his coming to defend herself in her mountains but advanced to meet him. Hassan may be supposed from various indications to have marched directly towards the Aures from his capital at Kairuan. On his road lay Tebessa, the Roman military station of Theveste and the city of Saint Augustin. The place had been the headquarters of the IIIrd (Augusta) Legion during the whole of the first century A.D. before its removal to Lambessa where it was stationed for two centuries more. Both Theveste ahd Lambessa were military posts strategically situated for watching the turbulent semi-nomads and mountaineers of the Aures and neighbouring massifs. Lambessa, at the N.W. corner of the Aures, was otherwise important as the guardian of the north-western approaches to the massif where access is perhaps easiest from the Maghreb; it also happened to lie in the gap by which the desert people could find a comparatively easy road into the more settled districts of Algeria. It served both to defend the gateway of the desert and the western approaches to the Aures and Tunisia. So important is the site that in modern times the French have established a military post for precisely the same motives at Batna in the immediate vicinity. The reasons which induced Hassan to march in this direction are therefore patent. From Theveste he was no doubt making for Lambessa itself, which was under the domination of the people of the Aures; to hold this place was necessary for a further advance westwards. He seems to have been proceeding round the northern slopes of the mountains when Kahena emerged from the fastness and obliged him to prepare for battle on the Miskiana River. She had assumed the offensive and pursued her advantage by attacking the Arab position. A hard battle ensued with considerable carnage; it terminated in the complete defeat of the Arabs, who were turned in headlong flight. Kahena pursued them eastwards out of the country and into Tripolitania. Hassan betook himself to Tripoli where he received peremptory orders from the Khalifa Abd el Melek to establish himself and await reinforcements which were promised should be sent from Egypt. The various accounts which we have of this campaign are not entirely clear. El Bekri states that Kahena had attacked Hassan's vanguard directly he enter Ifrikiya and apparently before the assault on Kairuan and Carthage; her advanced troops were commanded by one of Koseila's generals, and Hassan was driven out of the country</page><page sequence="13">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 741 to consolidate himself behind the Qsur Hassan in Tripolitania. From this we may infer that when the Arabs re-entered Tunisia in A.H. 68 they were immediately confronted by the light troops of the Berber army which scored some slight initial successes. But Ibn Khaldun and El Noweiri's accounts of the fall of Kairuan and Carthage and the subsequent battle on the Miskiana River are sufficiently circum- stantial to be regarded as the true sequence of events; El Bekri was engaged in giving a geographical rather than a historical description of the country. This authority states that Hassan built two forts at a point where there are a few gardens and some brackish water, to the west of Tripoli on the road to Ifrikiya, possibly at the place known as El Hassa on the present Franco-Italian boundary. Ibn Khaldun, however, also mentions the Qsur Hassan, and in accepting his version of the story it may legitimately be concluded that after the battle of the Miskiana River, there occurred the further events which included another reverse involving the Arab rearguard in disaster. It was in the course of this pursuit of Hassan's defeated army that one of his generals was killed and many prisoners were taken near Gabes. This fighting accelerated his rout and rendered his with- drawal as far east as Tripoli inevitable. He only succeeded with difficulty in consolidating his- position there by building the advanced posts at the point described by El Bekri. Kahena had been completely successful. She had achieved more than her predecessors. Even Koseila had. only chosen a favourable moment to rebel, whereas Kahena had deliberately challenged a fresh and victorious Arab army in open battle, and had routed it utterly and absolutely. It is unfortunate that we know so little of the early part of Kahena's life. She had been the leader of her own tribe and ipso facto nominal chief of the Aures if not of the whole Abter division of Berbers, since before the advent of the Arabs to Ifrikiya in A.H. 27. After the death of Koseila she actually became the principal personage among the Berbers. She only assumed an active r1le, however, as military leader when the country was again endangered by the advance of Hassan ibn Noman. If he had left Egypt in 68 this would have occurred in about 69 or 70. She must already have lost her father Tabeta when she assumed the leadership of the Jerawa in 27 ; her mother also had probably died, or the responsible position which she acquired would hardly have fallen to her lot among a people living under a matriarchal system whereby honour and authority are given to the senior women</page><page sequence="14">742 FRANCIS RODD- of princely families. But Kahena can hardly have been less than about 15 years old when she became the head of her tribe, so that her age must have been at least 57 in the year of the battle of the Miskiana. Such activity at the early age of 15 and as late in life as 60 is not unusual among the women of North Africa, where they grow up quickly, remain beautiful in the flower of their lives for only a short time, but continue for many years in wisdom and authority. Survivals of the matriarchal system are sufficient to explain her position among the Berbers. It would not have been extraordinary or very unusual. In her lonely and responsible life she had two sons of her own, but the name of her husband is not recorded. The little that is told of her personality is tantalizing. During the battle of the Miskiana River she captured a number of Arab prisoners, including one Khaled ibn Yezid, or Yezid ibn Khaled, el Kaisi. His name suggests a connexion with the friend of Okba, Zoheir ibn Kais, who was killed in Barca ; he is spoken of as a person of importance, but his origin is obscure. Khaled, we are told, was saved by Kahena, who "adopted him as her son ". It is a curious story of which we would like to know more. Why did the Queen, who was fighting the Arabs with all her strength, adopt one of the enemy as her son ? She had two sons of her own who were old enough to command detachments of her army. If, as is probable, Kahena had married when she was young, they would have been between 40 and 50 years old. But Khaled was not a child ; nor, in the light of after events, was he even a young man. What was this affection which prompted her to incur a risk that she must have foreseen might turn out so terribly badly, as indeed it did ? Her action implies that outwardly, at least, he must have shown some devotion for the queen; their relationship implied his conscious assent. But in an age where the fate of prisoners in war was more usually death, he displayed his gratitude by playing the part of a spy. He reported the queen's every movement to Hassan ibn Noman at Tripoli, and continued in his disloyalty for six years until he committed his final act of treachery. It is incon- ceivable that he should have succeeded in carrying on his disloyal correspondence for so long without Kahena hearing of his activities. The country was hostile to his intentions, and to his race. He must inevitably have been the object of jealous suspicion and surveillance on the part of the Berbers surrounding the queen. She did not believe what she must have been told. She neither drove him out nor rewarded him with the punishment he deserved, and when the end came she gave him his life; more than that, she ensured his personal safety. Kahena</page><page sequence="15">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 743 lost her kingdom, her country, and her life, but Khaled ibn Yezid was saved by her. The Arabs, as her name implies, attributed to Kahena divine inspiration, or the gift of seeing into the future. The familiar spirits foretold her destiny; they were after all perhaps nothing more than the wisdom and understanding which she possessed, for intuition and foresight have ever been esteemed as prophecy among people of grosser capacity. As soon as the campaign had been brought to a close, she returned to organize the government of Ifrikiya through the tribal chiefs of all those people who recognized her authority. That she should have ruled from Kairuan, as Koseila did before her, is inherently probable and the supposition is borne out by certain scraps of evidence. The site of her last battle against the Arabs is said to have been near Kairuan ; it is quite likely to have occurred near the Roman amphitheatre of El Jem, which is known to have been her fortress, some 40 miles to the south-east near the coast. Although there are few indications of the period during her wars when it was used as a military work, the fact that her first campaign began on the Miskiana River and terminated in a running fight on the frontiers of Tripolitania, point to her having fortified the amphitheatre during the second and last campaign against Hassan ibn Noman. If the accounts which have been given are in any sense true, the fighting in 69 was hardly of such a nature as to require the provision of strong points by th? Berbers, nor had she by then exercised her authority as far east as Kairuan. Of the Franks there still remained a certain number in the country, in the old Roman colonise. These also submitted to the Queen. Her kingdom extended over a vast area from the borders of Tripolitania as far as, and including Morocco. It stretched down into the desert to Ghadames on the southern spurs of the Tripolitan mountains where the great road from the Mediterranean runs to Central Africa by way of Ghat and the mountains of Air. In Ghadames, the entrepot of caravans, her memory was preserved long after her death in the name given to a number of underground structures which in the days of El Bekri were called the Prisons of Kahena. Elsewhere her kingdom skirted the desert to the south of the Aures mountains and along the steppes of Algeria. Though she herself has become nameless in the lapse of years, her legend has survived among the Veiled People of the Desert in Air; they have heard of the Great Queen who fought the Arabs and resisted the conquerors of the Noble People in the country of the north. Following her own inclinations and the accepted tradition of the</page><page sequence="16">744 FRANCIS RODD- Berbers, she forgave the Arabs who had fought against her and released the prisoners taken in battle. And there #as peace in the land for five years. At length Hassan ibn Noman received the reinforcements which had been promised from Egypt and in A.H. 74, or perhaps even later, returned to Ifrikiya to fight Kahena. The queen foresaw the magnitude of the struggle in which she would be involved, but her lack of initiative during the five years' truce is difficult to explain; it was responsible for her downfall. She may have been misled by Khaled ibn Yezid; she was certainly placed at a disadvantage by losing the liberty of offensive action. Even if she had not attacked Hassan in Tripolitania while he was recuperating, and driven him further east, she should at least have taken the field directly he approached Ifrikiya. Instead, she adopted a policy which was magnificent but fatal among people who lacked her own strength of mind and determination. She ordered the systematic destruction of her country in front of the Arabs in order to delay their advance, and stultify their conquest. Her short rule had been prosperous and successful; but she made ready to destroy the wealth of the land which she had rebuilt, after fighting to maintain its freedom. The execution of her orders provoked intense dissatis- faction. That they were executed at all is remarkable in itself. Traditionally the denudation of Tunisia has been attributed to the queen, but the accusation is probably unjust, for the century long misrule of the Arabs is sufficient to account for the poverty of the country. Until the advent of the French in quite modern times it did not recover sufficiently to compare in any way with the picture which we have in classical times of a land covered with happy towns and villages. Even now there are only bare rocks and dry watercourses around many of the ruined sites. Both the severity of her orders and their execution are characteristic; Ibn Khaldun says that " the land from Tripoli to Tangier with its crowded villages showed naught but ruins ". The Franks made indecent haste to secure their own terms by going over to Arabs. Many of the dissatisfied Berbers, represented by the bastardized sedentaries of the coastal districts, who certainly had more to lose than the semi-nomads of the mountains and interior, followed suit. They were induced to desert their leader by the promises of Hassan, who felt it politic to announce a general amnesty to all who would embrace Islam. It was perhaps natural that they should do so. They had often done so in the past, with the mental reservation</page><page sequence="17">KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS 745 that when a propitious moment arrived they could always rebel once more. The leniency of Hassan's terms and his preparatory intrigues which savoured almost of compromise with the enemies of his faith, prove how serious a task he anticipated. Kahena at last apprehended the danger of the situation, or as the Arabs said, her divine counsellors foretold that the end was not far off. She must at this time have been nearer 70 than 60 years old. Frankish treachery and Berber faint-heartedness surrendered Gabes, in the south of Tunisia, directly Hassan advanced. Nefzawa and Castilia were occupied shortly afterwards. As he moved northward, Kahena sent her two sons in charge of Khaled ibn Yezid to make their terms with the conqueror. Hassan accorded them mercy and made them honourable prisoners of war in charge of his officers. To recom- pense him for his services, Khaled was offered command of a detach- ment of the invading army and directed to attack his lady. He accepted the task with alacrity, and was engaged in the last battle which Kahena was ever to fight. The treachery of the Franks and of Khaled and the weakening of the Berbers in the towns had undermined the resistance of the population. Near to the coast, and about two days' march from Kairuan, is the Roman amphitheatre of El Jem. It is only a little smaller than the Colosseum at Rome and of the same design. It stands nearly perfect, overshadowing a small Arab village which has been built from a tiny part of its stones. The site is that of the Roman town of Thysdrus, but except for the circus the place has disappeared. The olive yards which surrounded the prosperous colonia of the third century A.D., where Gordian had been proclaimed Emperor in 283, were ordered by Kahena to be cut down. The plains all about are now interminable and bare. The amphitheatre looms up as a splendid landmark for miles in every direction. There are hardly any trees or gardens or vegetation near. The monument stands alone, overpowering in its size and solitude. Here Dihiyat el Kahena made her castle. Here, I think, she fought her last battle, deserted by her sons, betrayed by Kha.led ibn Yezid, and abandoned by all save her own loyal tribes from the Aures. She was attacked by the Arabs, who were victorious. There is little to add. Hassan called upon the Berbers to surrender, and proclaimed the amnesty which he had promised to all who would accept the True Faith. He demanded 12,000 auxiliaries for his army from among the people, and placed Kahena's two sons in command.</page><page sequence="18">746 KAHENA, QUEEN OF THE BERBERS But the Queen herself he failed to conquer. She had given no thought to safety or surrender for herself. She had expected to fall in battle, but her tribes fought too well. They broke through the Arab forces and escaped with the old queen. She made her way with the loyal remnants of her army to the mountains 300 miles away to the west. The Arabs fillally came up in pursuit, and the vision of her familiar spirit came true. She was killed in a last fight with the invaders at a place which thereafter was called the Well of Kahena in the Mountains of Aures. In all her 70 years she never gave in. Had she escaped right into the mountains which were her home I am sure she would have fought for her people again. The monument of her life is the fortress circus of El Jem, which stands alone and huge on the arid plains of Ifrikiya near the borders of the country that she had ruled and defended so well against an alien people. The monument of her death is a well in the Valleys of Aures, which divide the Desert from the Sown.</page></plain_text>
