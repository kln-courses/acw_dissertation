Let me declare at once that, for me, and I dare say for most readers, the most profitable chapters in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 161 this book are V, "The c A pint Movements in the Late Bronze Age," and VI, "The 'Sea-Peoples1 in Pa- lestine." By no means will readers agree with all the views expressed, but these chapters will at least provide several novel ideas. The latter, however, are rather peripheral to the main thrust of the work. Sad to report, the main thesis is not new, nor is it con- vincingly argued. It is an old idea, which one had hoped had been discredited. As stated on p. i, the main thesis (which was "quite conciously . . . chosen") is that Israel's political system, prior to the monarchy, consisted in the sovereignty of Yahweh. The deliberate adoption of this hypothesis is justified, without recourse to the prior assembling of evidence, as being "less mis- leading" (p. 4). In the subsequent pages no attempt is made to put the case by citing factual support; yet, on pp. 12-13, we are told that it is within the context of the great historical changes attendant upon the passage from Late Bronze to Iron I that "the genesis and development of the early Biblical faith must now be viewed." The pages which follow again fail to show why we must so view it, and only the passing remark that "the historical, linguistic and ar- chaeological evidence is too powerful to deny" is offered to allay the reader's unease (p. 16). Again, but a few lines further, we are informed that "early Israel is conceivable . . . not from what it evolved into." This is immediately followed by the remarkable statement that David is the Old Testament "Con- stantine," readapting the "authentic traditions of Israel." This insistence that the last quarter of the 2nd millennium B.C., the age of the Judges, was the crucial, formative period for Israel and her institu- tions, is an unfortunate tendency of a certain group of American scholars. It would be much easier to accept if their methodology were sound. As it is, one can do little and answer nothing by way of dialogue if one is only told what one must accept. The word "must" need not be used if the evidence is dispassionately set forth and the argument closely reasoned. But Mr. Mendenhall apparently sees no reason to argue his case. He speaks confidently of "oriental thought patterns of the time of Moses" (p. 60), and of "the authentic religious tradition of the Old Testament stemming from the time of Moses" (p. 65); and takes for granted "the Tenth century reduction to writing" of that tradition (p. 63). On what his confidence is founded he never says. It sounds more like an article of faith. But students of Egyptology will probably consult the book only for what the author has to say in passing about their discipline. Unfortunately it is rather superficial. In the wake of Gardiner, and with no reference to the work of Frankfort, Anthes or Assmann (to name but a few of his omissions), Mendenhall identifies the winged sun-disc as the symbol of Pharaoh, and "the deification of power which is recognized in the kingship" (p. 54). This is wrong-headed, it seems to me, in that the winged disc, along wath spread wrings surmounted by falcon head and the anthropomorphic falcon god, is simply a particular manifestation of Behdety, the falcon of Edfu. It is not particularly symbolic of kingship, nor a hypostasis of power. All deities in Egypt and their accoutrements partake of kingly attributes through deliberate or unconscious borrowing from Pharaoh. To find a royal epithet applied to the winged disc is no more significant than to find "king of the Two Lands" regularly predicated of Arsaphes, Ptah or Re. Mr. Mendenhall has a fixation with the supposed antithesis between "paganism," whether ancient or "modern," and the pristine purity of Israel's system of the "sovereignty of Yahweh" and the "covenant concept." It is as much a disservice to, and a distortion of, both the polytheistic forms and the Judaeo- Christian tradition to maintain such a simple dichot- omy as it is to continue supporting some of the oversimplified 19th century theological notions the author inveighs against. But Mendenhall hammers away at this theme incessantly, and whines on in such a high-flown, moralizing tone that the reviewer often felt he was confronted by said gentleman's sermon notes, and wondered why indeed he rather than a student of homiletics had been asked to review the work. Few readers will take kindly to Mendenhall's preaching at them, but his book does purport to be a scholarly treatment of the theme, and must therefore be taken seriously. Therefore, it will cause no little irritation to discover our author slipping in notes to the effect that he "believes" scholar so-and-so to have argued the point "somewhere," but "I have not recently found the relevant passage in his writings" (p. 7, n. 26) ; or again to come upon a statement quoted as supporting evidence with the added qualification "the source for this statement eludes me" (p. 9, n. 32). Elsewhere recourse is had to works as yet unpublished (p. 39, n. 32; 212, n. 38), or to statements "found in Thomas Jefferson, George Elliot and Schiller" without further reference (p. 216, n. 2) ! Albright is invoked as a witness, with no reference (the one given, p. 94, n. 71 is wrong), and whole bodies of literature and texts are trotted out in support without qualification. In the face of such untidy scholarship the reader may be excused for wishing the author had refrained from publishing. Like much Old Testament work done nowadays, the book ought to be done over again, a little more carefully and without the shibboleths and rhetoric. Donald B.
