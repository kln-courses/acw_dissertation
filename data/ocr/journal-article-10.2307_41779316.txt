<plain_text><page sequence="1">caves was an extraordinary event. Guapindaia had met João during previous research in the Amazon. He was aware of the urns' scientific value and alerted her soon after he found them. We re all worried that we won't find the caves, though João assures us that, being the dry season, it won't be a problem. For the moment, the difficulty rests in our navi- gating two miles of a black mud lagoon, stepping from palm trunk to palm trunk, balancing like tightrope walkers. We reach the other side, walk to the edge of a clearing, and suddenly Joãos smiles. "That's it!" he cries." It's right here!" We rush toward a cave entrance beyond a clump of</page><page sequence="2">Brazilian archaeologist Vera Guapindaia inspects a burial urn. One of the caves containing urns was hidden behind a dense curtain of vegetation. palms below a rocky outcrop. The urns are there! They've been overturned, perhaps by scavenging animals, but few of the 20 are broken. "Its a very moving to see them here, all together," says Guapindaia, directing the beam of her flashlight toward the statues' tubular bodies. They are each about two-and-a-half feet tall, though there are smaller ones, perhaps containing the remains of fetuses or infants. The urns were once paint- ed, and one can still discern traces of black, white, yellow, and red on them. Most of them represent men, women, and children, all in a seated position, but there are also urns in animal shapes, such as a small turtle.</page><page sequence="3">Guapindaia says the receptacles contain secondary inter- ments - bones from bodies earlier defleshed. Speculation that the corpses were first immersed in the river to be cleaned of flesh by piranhas was ruled out by an analysis of the bones conducted later by anthropologists from the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, who saw no evidence of tooth marks. Placement of the bones inside the anthropo- morphic urns mimicked their anatomy; foot bones were at the bottom of the containers, skulls at the top. The statues' heads served as covers. Despite hoards of ticks on the ground, Guapindaia crawls toward a small recess in the cave to reach one of the urns. "Unlike most cultures, the Maraca didn't bury their funer- ary urns," she says. "Theres a willingness here to display the dead, to maintain a relationship between dead and living." Worry overtakes us again as we spend the better part of three days searching for the other two caves. But we find them, solitary urns in each. Just how long the Maraca lived in the Amazon remains a mystery. "We don't have any idea of the age of the Maraca culture, nor when they first came to the region," says Edith Pereira, an expedition member and specialist in Amazon pre- history. "But it's not too soon to say the Maraca probably disap- peared in the seventeenth cen- tury, when the first Europeans settled here." A bead necklace accompanying the only urn on display at the Museu Goeldi may be evidence of this contact. What puzzles scholars is that all the statues are repre- sented seated on a bench. To be seated on a bench in the Amazon is "the privilege of chiefs, shamans, and guests," according to University of São Paulo ethnologist Manuela Carneiro da Cunha. The late ethnologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff believed benches possessed magical properties for the Indians, who described those without sound judgement as being "with- out a bench." The Maracas funerary statues are clearly dif- ferentiated by sex, but women and men are seated on benches, suggesting that both served as chiefs or shamans. Accounts of the region's first Western explorers, in par- ticular that of Francisco de Orellana, who in 1 542 was the first European to travel the Amazon, seem to confirm that women assumed nontraditional roles in tribal life. The Dominican monk Gaspar de Carvajal, a member of that expedition, wrote that the Spanish battled female warriors at the confluence of the Amazon and the Trombetas rivers. The Spanish called these women Amazons, referring to the mythical female warriors described by Homer and Herodotus. The great river is also named after them. Some scholars believe the Amazons encountered by Orellana belonged to a group known as the Caçoaimbaeguira, who were described by local Jesuits as speaking and dress- ing like men. Be that as it may, the iconography on ceramics produced by the region's people in later periods reveal a return to more traditional sex roles - men as chiefs and women serv- ing food or holding children. In 1896 a Brazilian collec- tor, Aureliano Lima Guedes, bequeathed a curious funerary urn to the Museu Goeldi. Neither pot nor jar, it was a fired clay statue of a man seat- ed on a bench, his arms bent, his hands lying flat on his knees. A necklace of blue and white colored glass beads was allegedly found in the vicinity of the urn. At the time, no one bothered much with the archaeological prove-</page><page sequence="4">nience of such an object, nor with its study. While the urn was virtually ignored, important discov- eries of refined ceramics and other artifacts from Marajó Island at the mouth of the Amazon and in the Santarém region to the south attracted the attention of collectors and, later, researchers. Marajó Island had been home to a culture that produced elaborate polychrome ceramics from the fifth century A.D. on. Excavations beginning in 1948 yielded jars; bowls; painted or incised plates with abstract, possibly mythological, decoration; and anthropomorphic funerary urns, the majority representing women. It was only in 1995 that the languishing museum urn came to the attention of archaeologists when a cave containing similar urns was found in the region of Igarapé do Lago in Brazilian Guyana. Guapindaia went to the site, transporting some of them back to the Museu Goeldis laboratories. Until fairly recently, most specialists believed that mi- grants from outside the rain forest, particularly from the Andean region, peopled the Amazon in the prehistoric era. "The Amazonian Indians," Guapindaia says, "were not considered anything more than a degenerate, tropical version of Andean culture." Now schol- ars believe exactly the opposite: its the Amazon tropical low- lands that contributed to the development of agriculture and ceramics in the central Andes. Early in the 1990s, excavations at Monte Allegre, a shelter cave in the lowlands, recovered arti- facts and plant and animal remains dating to around 10,000 years ago. Perhaps ca. 3,000 years ago, the areas hunter-gatherers became set- tled, evolving into complex societies. Cultures such as the Marajó or the Santarém seem to have flourished between the fifth and fifteenth centuries a.D. "The region was very pop- ulous in the prehistoric period," says Edith Pereira. "We should- n't impose on antiquity our notion of what the area is like today. Certain sites may even have been home to thousands of people." European diseases and the destruction and ex- ploitation of large stretches of the Amazon forest greatly reduced the region s Indian population. "With the cave discoveries, we now know that the sites of the Maraca culture are concentrated in a very limited geographical zone," says Guapindaia. Scholars exploring the northern Amazon in the 1950s and 1960s failed to locate any Maraca sites, and present thinking is that they lived in a circumscribed area along the Maraca River. "The caves may have been viewed as sanctuaries and may indi- cate that villages were nearby," she says. "We are looking forward to excavations here in the years to come, with all the problems that discovery and transport of such volumi- nous urns entail." ■ Bernadette Arnaud is a Paris correspondent for Archaeology.</page></plain_text>
