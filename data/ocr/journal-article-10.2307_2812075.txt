<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS The aim of this department is to give the reader brief indications of the character, the content, and the value of new books in the various fields of Biology. In addition there will occasionally appear one longer critical review of a book of special significance. Authors and publishers of biological books should bear in mind that THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY can notice in this department only such books as come to the office of the editor. The absence of a book, therefore, from the following and subsequent lists only means that we have not received it. All materialfor notice in this department should be addressed to H. B.

By Lecomte du Noiby. Longmans, Green and Com- pany, New York, London, and Toronto. $3.50. xii + 289 pp. 1947. Yet another book on religion by a scientist does not necessarily merit much attention.- However, when its publicity implies that it is "a scientific work ... which marks a new epoch in human thought"; when it is mentioned in the same sentence with the works of Descartes, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein; when a leading American scientist permits his remarks to appear on the cover jacket, saying, "A book of such fundamental grasp and insight as cannot be expected to appear more than once or twice in a century" (Robert A. Millikan-whose opinions, however, may be much more important in physics than religion) -then indeed the book must be examined, and ex- amined critically, by scientists. Du Notly has the distinction of being a biologist, whereas most of the other scientists who have pro- nounced on religious matters have been physicists. It seems entirely fitting that an attempt to bring biological evolution within the scope of religion should be made by a biologist. Even a biologist whose own work has not been especially in the field of evolution might be expected to have a better grasp of the subject than, say, a physicist. This is a curious book. Its scope is enormous. It first deals with scientific method. It treats of the origin of life, the whole panorama of biological evolu- tion, the emergence and present status of man and his future, though little that is concrete is said about his destiny, less than we are led to expect from the title. A large part of the book is devoted to a sermon on morality, which, if it did not sound quite so like a sermon, would be by far the best section of the work. Du Nouy's exposition of the importance of human dignity is alone a justification for the existence of the volume. Since the claim of the book is to present a hypothesis for the reconciliation of the picture of the world, as delineated by science, with the age-old intuitions of a religious nature-the "telefinalist theory of evolution'T -the crucial points to be examined by a scientific reader are those mathematical, physical, and biological concepts which are the fulcra on which it revolves. These are presented in very simple and understandable style in the first seven chapters of the book. Yet the reviewer was profoundly disappointed with these concepts as outlined here. The portion on the origin 315</page><page sequence="2">316 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of life would appear to have been written by a mathe- matician who had been shut away, not only from the physical world, but from all contact with chemists and geologists, one whose only outside influence had been from the direction of highly theoretical physics. The exposition of evolution demonstrates tremendous familiarity with the facts of paleontology, combined with an incredible lack of understanding of modern concepts of the process of evolution. The point of view presented resembles those theories of evolution advocated fifty years ago by biologists, long since abandoned by them, and now retained only by those theologians who have been forced, reluctantly, to accept the doctrine of evolution. The whole modern science of evolution, so ably summarized in Julian Huxley's Evolution, the Modern Synthesis, has apparently had no influence whatever on the author's ideas. An intimation of the limitations of the scientific portion of this book may be gained on page 18, where true scientific method is limited to analysis. If such a limitation is valid, then many scientists, including the reviewer, have been seriously exceeding their proper scope in a preoccupation with synthesis, held by them to be the necessary second half needed to complete the application of the scientific method. The author brings in the laws of chance to dispose of all possibility of a natural or materialistic origin of life. HEs example of the black and white powders which, once mixed, will never unmix themselves no matter how long they are reagitated, would not sound so convincing had he granted the white particles the property of cohering to white particles and the black partides that of cohering to black. His whole argu- ment, actually, is based on a universe composed of atoms and molecules with no differing properties what- ever. If one grants to atoms and to the myriad of aggregations of atoms that assortment of properties which they are observed to possess, then Eddington's "anti-chance" or "cheater" may well be totally un- necessary. If this is so, then the fundamental idea on which the book is based, that of the necessity for an extra-material influence, "will," or "God" to account for the origin and evolution of life,'supposedly in con- tradiction to the second law of thermodynamics, breaks down. It would seem, too, that the apparent conflict with this law does not really exist if life is regarded not as "an isolated material system" but as actually a part of the universe. The author's concept of evolution as an apparently directed, but certainly not very efficiently directed, trial and error process of striving for perfection, with actual evolution restricted to the single tortuous line that finally culminated in man, would not likely co- incide with that of many modem students of evolution. The now prevailing idea seems to be to regard evolu- tion as change in the characteristics of biological popu- lations and larger aggregations. The idea of progress is no longer regarded as synonymous with evolution, and the idea that the biological evolution of Homo sapiens has been completed may not find too much of a welcome. The creation or use of such words as "evolutive" may suggest that the author has wandered so far that he has lost contact with the very derivation of the word evolution. The projection into the future of evolution on a "psychological plane," aided and speeded up by tradi- tion, education, and moral effort on the part of in- dividuals of the human race, seems a hopeless mixing of concepts. What the author has in mind is without doubt a process that actually exists, and an important one. Whether it has any connection with evolution in the biological sense may be seriously questioned. Some psychologists may well question the duality of man, the fundamental conflict between "animal reactions" or "ancestral instincts" and "moral and psychic evolution" or "human dignity," a conflict which forms such an important part of du Nouy's ideas of evolution beyond the biological level. There would seem much more reason to believe that a balance between the two might comprise the ideal state. Un- due preoccupation with either, or the election of either extreme, might be, and indeed, has been equally de- structive. The idea that when a man "obeys his in- stincts" he "eliminates himself from evolution" is at least revealing as to the author's concept of evolution. Perhaps this evolution should be spelled with a capital E. One further wonders how, when man has reached the stage where the instinctive pleasures repel him (p. 177), the species will be reproduced. The section on the idea of God (chap. 14) contains some very interesting psychological speculation and some theology that may well prove equally unsatis- factory to fundamentalist and to scientist. God is considered a necessity, in order that the "entire or- ganized, living universe" be not incomprehensible. This is a very laborious justification of a belief in God. The author would, indeed, be horrified to be told that such a speculation is anthropomorphic in origin, but it is certainly that. We cannot conceive of the existence of a universe, or of anything else, without its having been created by someone or planned by an intelligence of some sort. Therefore we assume the existence of this intelligence, will, God. Regarding the origin of this God, we are now logically in exactly the same posi- tion as we were before in regard to the origin of the universe. We can perceive the universe, whereas we cannot perceive God. It is a definite strain to bring ourselves to believe in, or to accept, an intangible God, while it is no strain at all to accept the universe. It would, therefore, seem simpler to accept a universe without an obvious mode of origin than a God with the same drawback. If it were not for our background of anthropomorphic thinking, there would be no call whatever to create a God. Du Notuy's ideas on education are perhaps among the soundest parts of his book. There is no doubt that</page><page sequence="3">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 317 kind but firm discipline in the very early years of life offers a solution to many of the most difficult problems of teaching human beings to live with one another. It remains puzzling that, throughout the book, we are urged to do nothing that will weaken religion because it is needed by those who are not sufficiently intelligent or moral to get along without it, but on the other hand (p. 81), "Somehow the crowd must be made to under- stand that the important thing is, not to follow, but to make an individual effort...." These ideas are incompatible, and one has only to travel in countries where the crowds are carefully shielded from anything that might weaken their religion to know which is the preferable course. Though this book is by no means to be taken as expressing the modern point of view of scientists on matters of religion, nor marking a new epoch in human thought, still it is of great importance for these matters to be discussed and for all lines of reasoning to be ex- plored. Much of a moral quality that is good is re- iterated here, and the emphasis on the importance of human dignity and liberty is of tremendous value in times when both are threatened, and indeed outlawed, in large portions of the globe.
