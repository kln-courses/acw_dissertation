<plain_text><page sequence="1">would illuminate a whole new epoch of the past, completing the expanding picture offered by archaeology of the South Asian world in the third millennium B.C. Further volumes, initially two, are planned to cover the Indus seals preserved in Pakistan, and those elsewhere in the world. The third volume is also to contain the detailed catalogue of the pieces illustrated in the others, including that under review. The reader's first reaction is of admiration at what can be achieved when excellent scholar- ship is supported by first-class technical assistance and facilities. The assembling of so many admirable photographs, including many new ones, from objects in various museums, was a monumental undertaking. Throughout the work, photographs both of the original seals and of their impressions are included, frequently more than one of each, so that all possibilities of lighting are exploited. These plates form a fundamental resource for those interested in problems of the Indus writing. They are equally an unrivalled repertoire for students of art-history and religion. This iconography, preoccupied especially with bovines, suggests links with that of historic India. To the celebrated ' buffalo-hored deity' (M-304), moreover, besides the standard photos (p. 75), a colour illustration is devoted (p. 382-3). The authors understandably incline (despite some dissenting voices, e.g. Doris Srinivasan, 'Unhinging Siva from the Indus civilization', JRAS, 1984, 1, 77-89), to the traditional 'Siva' identification (p. xvii). No less interesting are the three seals (M-306- p. 76 and again in colour p. 384-M-307 and M-308) depicting an 'anthropomorph' grap- pling two lions-a reflection of the 'Master of the Beasts'. This was a subject widespread in ancient Near Eastern art and often labelled 'Gilgamesh', but more probably meant to represent a deity than a 'hero triumphant'. Which deity was intended could vary according to the context, and there is no indication at present which is depicted here. A concise introduction occupies the 32 pre- liminary pages, sketching the background to the discovery of Harappan civilization. There is a valuable survey and bibliography of current research, of the significance of Indus seals for the history of cultural contacts, and of the prevailing enigma of the script. Despite gallant efforts, one is left, inevitably, with the pessi- mistic impression that there has been little effec- tive progress in decipherment since G. R. Hun- ter's Script of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in 1934. The present book will certainly provide a stimulus for further research. Classification of the entries is arranged according to ownership, all the items here being in Indian public collec- tions. Then the succeeding levels of organiza- tion are by site-provenance, category of object, form, material, and iconography. Subjects are classified as 'unicorns', urus (= aurochs), bison, zebu, buffalo, markhor, goat, deer, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger, hare, snake, gharial, animal group, joined and composite animals, anthropomorph, tree, cult object ('manger'), ship, swastika, geometric designs, and aniconic. This arrangement allows rapid identification of specimens, and is eminently practical. Analysis of the inscriptions in relation to provenance, iconography and assumed function of the seals now becomes possible, and-will no doubt be pursued by researchers in due course. Interestingly, for example, on p. 191, H-102, the sign-group on the reverse of the seal (in intaglio, therefore a counterseal), also forms the first group of the inscription on the obverse. The same is the case with p. 79, M-318. There the element following is ' numerical', succeeded, as frequently, by a 'trident'. Similar 'numeral' groupings terminated by the 'trident' are on M-17, M-32, M-103, M-177 to 179, M-224, M-254, M-283, M-292, L-20, K-19. The trident ending has a special, perhaps exclusive, affinity for numeral groups. These are no doubt but a few of the intriguing sequences perceptible on these handsome plates, so much more easily grasped by human imagination than the blind numerals of previous computer printout. No doubt numerous leads will be suggested to future researchers. In a work on this scale, comprising 1537 items, occasional errors naturally are inevitable, though they seem com- mendably few. There is a list of corrigenda on p. 375, to which one may add the trifle that on p. 242, L-16A and L-16a (the original and its impression) appear transposed. In advance of the formal catalogue, there is a list (pp. 366- 375) of concordance, excavation and museum numbers. (The first series are those of S. Koskenniemi, A. and S. Parpola, Materials for the study of Indus script, I: a concordance to the Indus inscriptions, Helsinki 1973.) Ultimately reverse concordances of numbers will also be helpful, now easily compiled by computer spreadsheet. This book constitutes a major achievement, providing a fresh start for a study that not long ago seemed in danger of stagnating. The purposes of its distinguished sponsors have been admirably fulfilled, and readers will look forward with enthusiasm to the appearance of the succeeding volumes. A. D. H. BIVAR MICHAEL BOYLAN and WILBERFORCE CLARKE (tr.): Hafez: Dance of life. [110] pp. Cassette. Washington, D.C.: Mage Publishers, 1988. The work under review is another splendidly produced volume of Persian literature from the publishers of Nima Yushij's When the elephants came and Sadiq Hadayat's Patient stone in translation. It is a timely production since the fourteenth-century Persian poet and thinker, Khvaja Shams al-Din Muhammad Hafiz, of Shiraz, has only recently been reinstated in the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of the country's greatest poetical luminaries. This convenient publication should undoubtedly attract a new body of readers who may hitherto have only occasionally heard of the sage of Shiraz and who may not be well equipped linguistically to appreciate the intricacies of his poetical langu- age and the underlying philosophical ideas so dear to the Persians. HaIfiz's poetry has long stimulated great inter- est among Persian scholars in the Western world. There have been many attempts to popularize his ghazals and to attract a broader readership, but these translations have not 568 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS roused anything like the enthusiasm that 'Umar Khayyam did in the English-speaking world during the second half of the nineteenth cen- tury, no doubt because the latter presents far fewer difficulties for the European reader. The editors of this new selection of Hafiz's poems and the accompanying translations mark a new start with a more comprehensive approach and a skilful use of modern tech- nology, but whether it will fare better than its predecessors, only time will tell. The main intention of the editors is clearly to convey to the uninitiated reader the multi- faceted strength and subtlety of the poetic language, and to present the major ideas under- pinning the literary and cultural heritage of Iran. The task of giving a coherent account of these features poses enormous difficulties if much of the artistry of Hafiz is not to be lost. The editors have sought to provide 'a multiple perspective for the reader at every level: from the lyric to the metaphysical, from free illumination to disciplined calligraphy, from contemporary verse translation to an English translation'. To this end, the number of poems selected for treatment has been limited to 12 out of a corpus of around 500. The book is divided into various sections: part 1 comprises free-verse translations by the American poet and philosopher Michael Boylan and the nineteenth-century translations of H. Wilber- force Clarke (2vols., Calcutta, 1891), and the ghazals from the edition of Qazvini/Ghani, written in nasta'lrq by Amir Hossein Tabnak, interspersed with modern drawings by Hossein Zenderoudi, in an effort to provide an Einstim- mung with the world of Hafiz. Part 2 gives some basic rules to 'help the Persian reader in accurate pronunciation and recitation'. These are based on such authorities as Elwell-Sutton (The Persian metres) and Khanlari (Vazn-i shi'r-i Farsi), and understand- ably concentrate on practical application rather than systematic description. However, ques- tions of accuracy do arise. Thus it seems confus- ing to find 'connectives' mentioned as a sub- section of the vowels in Persian and similar problems arise in relation to the consonants. In addition, the phonological system is not always explained adequately. Moreover, to describe the Arabic-Persian alphabet as 'Persian letters' rather than the more usual 'Arabic script' is unhelpful to the non-specialist reader seeking to identify the alphabet. This section is followed by the texts of the 12 poems, again in nasta'llq, and in transliteration, with annotations, some by the editors and some selectively reproduced from Clarke's transla- tion. There is useful information in these com- mentaries but they could have been fuller for the European reader, unfamiliar with the inferences and hidden messages of the text, who may well feel the ground giving under his feet at times. In his Afterword, Michael Hillmann des- cribes and analyses the unique appeal which Hafiz has had for his readers down through the centuries, his influence reaching as far as radical modern poets in the secular camp, like Furugh Farrukhzad, and even recent Islamic revolu- tionaries, like Riihullah Khumaini. But the unique appeal of Hafiz's ghazals for the moder Iranian reader cannot be explained solely by the masterly incorporation of various artistic and philosophical strands in his distinctive personal style. H.fiz is unique because, as Jalal Al-i Ahmad once aptly put it, he embodies 'the Iranian world view'. This quintessential Iranianness found its expression in 'pairs of opposites or contraries' and in the view that ' bipolarities and dualities are part and parcel of the lives of thinking individuals and that, more importantly, cultural dilemmas are not sup- posed to be resolved', to quote Hillmann's account of the attraction of Hafiz's poetry for the modern reader. It is precisely this ambivalence which opens vistas on to the meta- physical and mystical aspects of the Iranian cosmos so subtly controlled and released in Hafiz's poetic work. While it is extremely difficult for the Westerner, to whom the present work is addres- sed, to penetrate these various layers of a rich poetic tradition, Michael Boylan's sensitive free-verse translations, supported by a well- produced cassette readings of the Persian and English texts, have opened a way in. This is, indeed, the right way to bring the ghazals closer to a wider English-speaking audience. PAUL LUFT SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI: Literature in the Vedic age. Vol. Ii: The Brdh- manas, Aran.yakas, Upanisads and Veddhga Suitras. (Bagchi Indologi- cal Series, 4.) vi, 404pp. Calcutta: K. P. Bagchi, 1986. Rs. 170. This second volume continues directly from the first (reviewed in BSOAS, XLIX, 3, 1986, 595-6). Thus, after just a contents page, the text begins with ch. v on the Brihmanas, although the pagination is not continuous between the two volumes. Less justifiably, having reached the end of ch. viii on the Veddhga Sutras, it just stops without any attempt to draw together the threads of the work as a whole. Both the author's aims and the measure in which they are achieved remain effectively the same in this volume. That is, it is intended to provide an up- to-date account of the subject for Indian students, incorporating also the results of researches published in French and German for their benefit, with a greater emphasis on the literary than on the religious aspects. It does not claim, therefore, to be a piece of original research but a survey of current interpretations. Within its own terms of reference, it continues in this second volume to be broadly successful, although one major qualification is that, despite the intended emphasis on literary aspects, the author devotes most space simply to description of the contents of the different categories of the literature. The chapter on the Brdhmanas is the longest, followed by that on the Upanisads, while that on the Ara.nyakas is much the shortest, as one might expect. Each chapter is subdivided into a substantial number of subsections (including, for example, in the Brdhmana chapter, sections on the text, poetry, and vac, and society, the family, women, caste, and social customs, out of a total of twenty-four such sections), which are not always as clearly distinguished from each other as they might be; this has resulted in some 569</page></plain_text>
