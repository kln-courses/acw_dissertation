<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DATA OF SOCIOLOGY. CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY. VI. THE leading distinction between modern and ancient philoso- phy is that the former proceeds from facts while the latter pro- ceeded from assumptions. Every science is at the same time a philosophy. The greater part of all that is valuable in any science is the result of reasoning from facts. What would geology be if all we know was the bare facts that the rocks present ? The history of the world as geologists now understand it is all deduced from a state of things that is now fixed or sta- tionary. It is true that similar movements are now taking place, or may be artificially caused to take place, from which past movements may be inferred, but they are none the less inferred. The geological period practically closed when the human period began, so that no record is possible. Yet who shall say that we do not know all that we claim to know about the earth's history ? The evidence, though all circumstantial, is absolutely irresistible as to the main points on which all geologists agree. Yet it is all inference. In other words geology, so far as it furnishes us anything of value is a philosophy. As much might be said of physics and chemistry. They deal with agencies and elements wholly beyond the range of our senses, and yet most of the material progress of the world has resulted from men's reason- ings about these invisible and intangible things. The chemical atoms, the luminiferous ether, electricity, all existed the same as now before anything was known of them. It is clear therefore that all the value they have now is due to the actions of men, and this has chiefly consisted in observing facts and drawing conclusions from these facts. So that chemistry and physics constitute a philosophy. Thus we might go through the whole list. The more complex a science is the greater the num- 738</page><page sequence="2">THE DA TA OF SOCIOLOGY 739 ber of facts required to reason from, and the more difficult the task of drawing correct conclusions from the facts. When we come to sociology the number of details is so immense that it is no wonder many declare them wholly unmanageable. I con- fess that to proceed according to the method chiefly in vogue of attacking the concrete phenomena presented by local and restricted areas and accumulating a heterogeneous mass of details, the case would be hopeless. The only prospect of success lies in a classification of the materials. This classification of socio- logical data amounts in the end to the classification of all the subsciences that range themselves under the general science of sociology. In calling this paper the "Data of Sociology" I have no idea of attempting an enumeration of the data of sociol- ogy. All I hope to do is to indicate how we can proceed to gather and investigate the data. To attempt to give details would be like taking a shovelful of earth from the side of a mountain. But if the details can be classified into first large and then smaller, and then still smaller groups, some of these groups may finally be so far reduced as to offer some hope that they may be investigated. This series of papers being devoted wholly to the philosophy of sociology, does not contemplate the consid- eration of any even of the smaller groups of sociological data, and the only justification for a chapter on the data of sociology is just this effort so to organize the different classes of data that it may be clearly seen what the concrete facts are from which the laws of associative action are to be deduced. Let us begin with the most general and proceed analytically toward the more and more special. In fact it will be well to begin entirely outside of sociology proper and consider first, on the basis of the classification attempted in the first paper, and in the light of all that has been said in the four subsequent papers, the depend- ence of sociology upon the other less complex and more general sciences. These simpler sciences may themselves be regarded as constituting a part of the data of sociology. Some knowledge of them is essential to any adequate comprehension of the full scope and meaning of sociology. It may have a discouraging</page><page sequence="3">740 THE AAMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY sound to say that in order to be properly prepared for the study of sociology one must first be acquainted with mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology, but when it is clearly understood what is meant by this it loses much of its formidableness. For it has never been maintained that it is necessary to become a specialist in all, or even in any of these sciences. It is only essential to have a firm grasp of the leading principles of all of them and of their relations one to another. It would be far better to devote time to this aspect of each of them than to mastering the details, as is so largely done in the present system of education. A certain amount of detail is of course necessary to furnish a full conception of what any science is and means, but it need go no farther than this. The pedagogic prin- ciple applies to any science. A fair acquaintance with the gen- eral principles of all the simpler sciences is essential to a full understanding of the one it is proposed to make a specialty of. The astronomer must understand mathematics, the physicist should be familiar with the laws that govern the solar system, the chemist should be acquainted with the general principles of physics, the biologist should have a fair command of chemical phenomena, and especially of those of organic chemistry, and the psychologist cannot dispense with a thorough foundation in the general laws of life and in the facts of anatomical and physi- ological science. So, of course, the sociologist, before he can fully perceive the scope and significance of his science, must know the laws of mind which directly underlie the whole social fabric. It is also always a great gain if the philosophical student of these higher sciences can have the advantage of much deeper drafts from the more directly underlying sources. It has an immensely broadening and deepening effect upon the study of mind or of society, to pursue, as a pastime or as a profession, some special branch of biology-botany, entomology, ornithology, or gen- eral zo6logy. The special study of physiology a-nd anatomy, par- ticularly their comparative study, is also exceedingly helpful to the psychologist or the sociologist. In fact, long and continuous</page><page sequence="4">THE DA TA OF SOCIOLOGY 741 occupation with any special class of natural phenomena, no matter how restricted that class may be, yields an acquaintance with the ways of nature that is wonderfully educating in fields far outside of that narrow circle of observation. This apparently iron-clad law of the study of the sciences, which seems to make such an extraordinary tax upon the sociol- ogist, is therefore, after all, little more than the requirement that the sociological student shall first of all acquire a good general education. It does not so much prescribe the quantity of his learning as the direction it should be made to take. It says that his education should be mainly scientific, that his study of the sciences should be so ordered as to give him a clear idea of their natural relations and dependencies, that they should be taken up so far as possible in the order of their decreasing generality and increasing complexity, and that they be pursued in this direction at least to include the science upon which the chosen specialty directly rests. In case of sociology this is of course to cover the entire range of the sciences, but in reality, this is noth- ing more than any well organized curriculum necessarily involves, and even the mathematician often goes through the entire course. It could be easily shown that sociology not only depends upon psychology and biology for its fundamental principles, but that the phenomena of human association would be seriously affected by any modification in the more general laws of the physical universe. Consider how different would be the affairs of men if the angle which the plane of the earth's orbit makes with the ecliptic were considerably greater or less so as materially to affect the seasons. So if the laws of motion, of gravitation, or of light and heat vibration were other than they are the social, and indeed the whole organic world, would be correspondingly different. Chemical phenomena still more closely influence animals and men, and it goes without saying that vital and psychic phenomena are what immediately govern and shape those of the human and social world. The primary data of sociology, then, are seen to consist of this general preliminary scientific education, this firm grasp of</page><page sequence="5">742 THE AMERICA N JOURNA L OF SOCIOLOGY the broad cosmical principles that underlie and govern all depart- ments of natural phenomena. But it is just this, as already remarked, that really ought to be afforded to every member of society irrespective of the field of labor that may be chosen. It is this that furnishes the most valuable of all knowledge, viz., knowledge of the environment. Paradoxical though it may sound, the knowledge of the environment is the most practical and useful of all knowledge, and it should be the principal aim of all sound education to furnish it. But upon this I need not now enlarge.' The more specific data of sociology consist in the facts con- tributed by the various branches or sciences that fall directly under it, in the relation described in the first paper, of true hierarchical subordination. This is in harmony with the general method of science in proceeding from the concrete to the more and more abstract. The sciences just enumerated are abstract in the sense of abstracting the concrete facts and subordinate laws and deal- ing only with the highest and most general principles. But such general principles are derived from the less general ones of which they are the generalizations. The subordinate principles are in turn only the expression of orderly phenomena, and such phenomena are only the modes of manifestation of the concrete objects occupying each field. The establishment of these higher sciences is simply a process of generalization from the facts of observation. In the case of sociology we have first and foremost the con- crete fact man. It is absolutely necessary to the study of sociol- ogy to study man as a concrete fact. Anthropology, as was shown, is a concrete science, and differs generically from biology and psychology, which deal respectively with the laws of life and mind. It is even more concrete than either botany or zo6l- ogy, in treating only of one species, or as some think, genus, of living things. So far as man's actions are concerned, especially his rational actions, they fall under psychology, and have already been considered. But the creature man. considered as a material x See Dynamic Sociology, Vol. II., pp. 492 ff.</page><page sequence="6">THE DATA OF SOCIOLOGY 743 object and as a great group of innumerable discrete individuals possessing many qualities, constitutes the primary datum of sociological study. First, this being may be described (ethnog- raphy) and subdivided into different races (ethnology), and then special attention may be given to his physical constitution (soma- tology), and also to what he produces (technology). Closely associated with this last, indeed an important part of it, is the search for the record he has left, consisting almost exclusively of such products belonging to past periods and preserved from destruction. This is archaology. But many of his productions are not material, and consist of institutions of various kinds. Using this term in a broad sense institutions embrace language, cus- toms, governments, religions, industries, and ultimately art and literature. The study of these constitutes real history as distin- guished from the mere "kistoire-bataille." Migrations and the vicissitudes of empire, even the doings of the persons who hap- pen to stand in the front of these movements, belong here, but their importance is apt to be exaggerated. All of these great fields of activity are capable of being divided and subdivided, and each little part erected into a science to be specially studied. The study of language forms the science of philology. Out of government there unfolds the great field of law and jurisprudence. The study of industry opens out in one direction into the field of political economy and in another into that of invention, machinery, and all the arts of civilization. History becomes crystallized in the form of statistics, which is the algebra of events. Now all this vast array of phenomena manifested by man in his manifold relations with the material world constitutes the data of sociology, and something must be known about it before any one is capable of entering into the consideration of those higher laws involved in human association, which, on final anal- ysis, are simply generalizations from the facts of lower orders. It is true that in the course of acquiring a sound general educa- tion every one necessarily learns something about most of these things, but this is insufficient to constitute an adequate prepara-</page><page sequence="7">744 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY tion for the study of sociology. This knowledge needs to be systematized and specialized, and directed to the definite end. The student needs to know just what he is pursuing it for. There is no more vicious educational practice, and scarcely any more common one, than that of keeping the student in the dark as to the end and purpose of his work. It breeds indifference, dis- couragement and despair. Therefore, while it would be fruitless to attempt to teach the principles of sociology before the student was put in possession of the facts from which those principles are derived, it is of the utmost importance to inform him as early as he is likely to understand what it means, that there is a great general science of society toward which all this is leading, and constantly to keep him imbued with the idea of an ultimate util- ity beyond the mere satisfaction of the desire to know facts. Looking over this great field with the eye of reason, we are able to grasp its general import; and first of all, it is profitable to note that the facts that make up the data of sociology constitute so many varying classes of phenomena. That is to say, they are the manifestations of the qualities or properties of the multitu- dinous units of society or individual men. These differ at differ- ent times and places and constitute a complex manifold or mul- tiple. There are distinct individualities in all the aggregates, from the ultimate units themselves upward through all their combinations into aggregates of higher orders. The study of such a varying manifold, however viewed, is essentially in the nature of history, and therefore the approaches to sociological study are all primarily historical. Moreover this history con- forms in all essential respects to the character of the phenomena which are currently described by the term natural history. Now this natural history of society readily subdivides into two groups, according to whether we study man himself in his social aspect, or his achievements. The first of these groups is anthropology in its proper sense, a sense considerably more restricted than that in which the term is commonly used. It would, for example, rigidly applied, exclude technology and archxeology, but this is less important to our present purpose.</page><page sequence="8">THE DATA OF SOCIOLOGY 745 It might be extended to embrace the ruder forms of art, but it has chiefly to do with race characteristics as the result of those individualities that have been mentioned, including everything that serves to differentiate the groups of human beings found inhabiting the earth. In short it is par excellence the natural his- tory of man. The second subdivision of the subject, which relates to human achievement, as distinguished from man himself, considers every- thing which can, in the broadest acceptation of the term, be classed under the head of human institutions. This branch deals essentially with what ethnologists denominate culture, and con- stitutes history proper. The several stages of culture, savagery, barbarism, civilization, enlightenment, or by whatever names they may be designated, are so many steps in the general progress of what is called civilization in the broader and more popular sense. The study of this is also a branch of natural history, since, prop- erly, all history is natural history, but here we are one remove farther from the biological base from which the natural history of man, as I have defined it, directly proceeds. Especially does the psychological element now distinctly make itself felt, and the qualities we have to deal with instead of being mainly phys- ical become almost exclusively psychical. The animal world, properly speaking, achieves nothing. It may work changes, more or less extensive, in the face of nature, but this is merely the incidental result of activities which do not have any such effect for their object. Nothing in the nature of art exists below the human stage, and in that treatment of man from which art is abstracted human achievement is also necessarily omitted. Man is considered as an active being, indeed, as constantly doing something, but not as ever making anything. In the history of culture, as distinguished from the natural history of man,- he is considered as primarily a producer of what did not exist before. While we are unacquainted with any stage of human history in which these two states do not coexist, it is a highly logical mode of studying the subject to treat them apart. The causes which originally led to human association were</page><page sequence="9">746 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY treated in the fourth paper; it may be added here that no race or condition of men is known in which association does not exist. We may therefore assume that it took place very early, and prob- ably at a wholly subhuman stage. It was doubtless one of the most powerful mutual factors in the rapid brain-development mentioned in that paper. This brain-development was the con- dition of the psychic element which made man a creator, the master instead of the slave of his environment, and which above all else distinguishes him from the rest of nature. The first and foremost, then, of all the productions of this being is society itself, considered as an artificial institution. For however early it may have come into existence, it is to be distinguished from all animal societies as the product of reason instead of a product of instinct. It is this and this alone which constitutes it an insti- tution. The study of this institution from this point of view, in its most embryonic stages and among the least developed races, therefore constitutes one of the most important fields of research, and comes clearly under the head of sociological data. About the first subject to which associated man turned his attention must have been the proper care of the young. Natural selection alone would secure this, since those who neglected it would be eliminated. This is the basis of the institution of marriage, and a careful survey of the various forms which this institution has assumed, both in primitive and advanced races, shows that it is in all cases more or less successfully adapted to this end. Even polyandry, which prevails in some districts of Thibet, and which seems so repugnant to our ideas, has been shown to be the best form of marriage for a people leading the kind of life which is required in such a country, where a portion of the men are obliged to absent themselves from home for a large part of the time. It is not enough to observe and record the customs of a people; sociology, scientifically studied, inquires into the reasons that underlie customs. The institution of government doubtless grew out of that of the family. The latter was not always, and is not everywhere, restricted to the narrow degrees of kinship that we recognize as</page><page sequence="10">THE DA TA OF SOCIOLOGY 747 alone belonging to it. The tendency originally was to embrace all of one kindred in one family, and this is the true origin of the gens. But here came in another apparently antagonistic principle. Somehow the lowest races of men realize that close breeding is injurious. How they find it out is an interesting question, but one that cannot be discussed here. They all know it and act upon this knowledge. To preserve the vigor of the race is next in importance to preserving its existence. Therefore marriage institutions must be framed to secure this end as well as the other. Hence the widespread and severe penalties against marrying within the gens. Leaving the vast subject of primitive marriage with these few general hints, we may further note the association of gentes into tribes and the consolidation, by war or otherwise, of tribes into nations. From this to the study of the semi-civilized and civilized nations and governments of the world the steps are easy and natural. Going back again to the earliest dawn of society we may take up another prominent class of phenomena and study the development of human thought. The simplest phenomena of nature have always been regarded as taking place according to natural laws. The experience of the race and of each individual is sufficient to teach this. Primitive man is not troubled about the causes of the facts of everyday experience, and unbeknown to himself, he reaches the scientific conception of uniformity and invariability in this restricted field. In fact, in a still narrower field, animals also act upon this same principle. If they are not rational they at least are not irrational. What mind qualities they manifest are always thoroughly practical and sane. Their acts are always characterized by what is called "horse sense." It is only rational man who deviates from this norm and indulges in irrational actions. This happens as soon as he begins to rea- son about phenomena, i. e., to draw inferences from the facts of observation. His data are always at first necessarily insufficient to enable him to draw the correct conclusion, and he conse- quently draws an erroneous one. When we reflect that it has required ages of exhaustive scientific investigation to enable</page><page sequence="11">748 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY us to reason correctly about the causes of such everyday phe- nomena as an echo, a shadow, or a reflection in a pool of water, we can readily see how impossible it must be for primitive man to reach the solution of the recondite problems that nature constantly thrusts upon him. But the fact that, unlike the humbler and more sensible creatures below him, he tries to solve these problems, is just what stamps him as a superior being. This act of his is the beginning of philosophy, and the study of the philosophy of primitive man constitutes legitimate data for sociology, Primitive philosophy is always anthropomorphic. A phenomenon, from its very name, is a change, a transformation, an activity. But the only being the primitive man knows to possess the power of spontaneous activity is himself, and he nat- urally imputes to every other change the same power. I need not trace the steps from this primordial stage to a full-fledged mythology, but mythology constitutes the philosophy of all undeveloped races. Out of mythology grows religion, if it is not itself religion, and religion is essentially a product of man's rational faculties applied to transcendental questions. It can only be from a profound misconception of this truth that Mr. Benjamin Kidd in his book on "Social Evolution" repeatedly speaks of religion as "ultra-rational." It has surprised me greatly that the religious world has failed to call him to account for such a fallacy, and in seeming rather to uphold him, it is tacitly admitting this, greatly to its discredit. Religion is pri- marily and fundamentally rational. It had its origin in an effort of the reason. No being without a well-developed reason is capable of conceiving of a religious idea. It is, in fact, one of the great branches of philosophy, and the history of religion is in great part the history of human thought. At every stage it constitutes most important data for the science of sociology. And then we might go back again and take up another great trunk line of social history and trace the rise and progress of the arts. Nothing is more fundamentally important to sociol- ogy than to study the workings of the inventive faculty, spurred on by its strict mother necessity. Leaving it to the psycholo-</page><page sequence="12">THE DATA OF SOCIOLOGY 749 gists to teach how this most important of all psychic attributes arose,' the sociological course may limit itself to the study of its products and to tracing it down through history to where it finally ushered in the age of machinery. Involved in this is the whole history of human industry, and political economy is itself only a special department of this wider field of research. This is the place to point out the grounds that exist for the claims of the historical school of political economy. We have seen that the data of sociology are, properly understood, essen- tially historical. Sociology, to become a true science, must rest on facts. It must consist of a body of truth, i. e., of broad principles derived from an accurate coordination of known facts. But from the nature of the case these facts must be furnished by the activities of human beings. These activities, taken in a broad sense, constitute human history, and as sooIn as we can divest ourselves of the idea that history is limited to a narrative of the doings of a few men whom events chance to bring to the surface at long intervals, it will become apparent that the entire industrial activity of the world belongs to history. But in such a vast field it is very important to find some mode of simplifying phenomena. It is necessary to seize upon certain natural keys to the whole system. If a few of the principal strands upon which it is all woven can be discovered and kept distinct the whole web may be seen to much greater advantage. There are many of these, and each student may choose his method. No better system has ever been proposed than that of regarding events as products of ideas and classifying ideas. This is the true psychic method and recognizes sociology as directly resting upon psychology. It is found that the progress of intelligence produces regular and necessary changes in human ideas. In the primordial blank condition of the mind the anthropomorphic mode of interpretation is the only one; inanimate objects are animated and animals are endowed with intelligence. Fetish- ism prevails. In the next stage intelligence and will are disem- bodied and ascribed to immaterial or spiritual beings. Polythe- Cf. Psychzic Factors of Civilization, Part II., especially chaps. xxvii.-xxx.</page><page sequence="13">750 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY ism reigns. At length the number of these beings suffers a reduction and ultimately they are limited to one. Monotheism holds sway. Under monotheism the spirit of speculation finds encouragement, and with it the forces of nature and the proper- ties of matter are erected into so many separate and independent existences or entities. Ontology or metaphysics dominates human thought. The faith in such entities is not reverential, and the bolder spirits soon question them and dare to institute investi- gation. The result is always the same, and the true order of nature is brought to light. How profoundly the whole social structure is influenced by the domination of one after another of these great fundamental classes of ideas can only be under- stood by a careful study of human history from this point of view. The great number of social correlations that can be found by such an inquiry is especially interesting. The most noted is that of militancy and the rdigime of status, as Sir Henry Maine calls it, with the earlier theological stages, and of industrialism and the rigime of contract, in Spencer's phrase, with the later rational and scientific stages. But, as I said, this is not the only legitimate and successful way to simplify the study of the real history of society, and the German historical school has already accumulated an immense amount of data, especially with reference to the historic period, and is still at work, almost, as it would seem, without conceiv- ing the idea of making any general application of it to the founding of a science of sociology, but which is certain sooner or later to be thus utilized to the advantage of our science. I have already referred to statistics as one of the chief sources of sociological data so far as relates to the history that is in process of making in modern states, and it would be a serious fault not to mention the method adopted by Spencer under the name of "descriptive sociology" for the lower races now occupying the outlying portions of the globe. But the data acquired by this method lose much of their value through their extreme unreliableness. The travelers who have supplied the greater part of this material, however well meaning, lack for the</page><page sequence="14">THE DA TA OF SOCIOLOGY 751 most part the scientific training necessary to qualify them for such work, and the only correct method is that of sending out trained observers representing some scientific body, who shall make systematic observations under the guidance of fixed princi- ples, designed to avoid to the utmost the errors into which the casual observer is liable to fall. This method has been adopted for many years by the United States Bureau of Ethnology in the study of the North American Indians, and the numerous able and voluminous reports of that bureau constitute an invaluable resource for the sociologist who aims to found the science upon a broad ethnic basis. Much has been said of late about the so-called " special social sciences" and their relation to sociology. Some regard sociol- ogy as consisting entirely of these sciences and as having no existence apart from them. Others distinguish sociology from the special social sciences, but in different ways. The latter are sometimes identified with "'social science," and this is treated as distinct from sociology. There is less variety of opinion relative to the nature of the special social sciences than there is relative to what sociology is if distinguished from these. I have often been asked my opinion on this question, and this seems to be the place to indicate my method of dealing with it. The special social sciences are numerous, and, in many cases, there is room for differences of opinion as to what constitutes such sciences, but the following are the principal ones about which there is little dispute: ethnography, ethnology, technology, archaeology, demography; history, economics, jurisprudence, pol- itics, ethics-all taken in a scientific sense, and with such natural subdivision of each as it admits of. No one of these, nor all of them together, can be said to form sociology, but sociology is the synthesis of them all. It is impossible to perform this syn- thesis without a clear conception of the elements entering into it. These, therefore, constitute the data for the process. The special social sciences, then, are not themselves the science of sociology, but they constitute the data of sociology. From all that has been said it follows that sociology proper,</page><page sequence="15">752 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY or the science of the laws of society, is one that requires ample preparation. I cannot, therefore, agree with those who would introduce it early in the undergraduate course. At the earliest it should not be taken up before the senior year, and its study in any adequate manner should be made postgraduate. It is essentially a university study, while the preparation for it, i. e., the acquirement of the Data of Sociology, belongs to the gym- nasium. LESTER F. WARD. WASHINGTON, D. C.</page></plain_text>
