<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mircea Eliade AUSTRALIAN RELIGIONS: AN INTRODUCTION PART II* For the Australians, as well as other primitive societies, the world is always "their own world," that is to say, the world in which they live and whose mythical history they know. Outside this familiar cosmos lie amorphous, unknown, dangerous lands, peopled by mysterious and inimical ghosts and magicians. The aborigines dread an adventure, even in numbers, into unknown territories.1 These strange lands do not belong to their "world" and consequently still partake of the uncreated mode of being. Yet even the most arid and monotonous landscape can become a "home" for the tribe when it is believed to have been "created" or, more exactly, transformed by Supernatural Beings. Giving shape to the land, the Supernatural Beings at the same time made it "sacred." The present countryside is the result of their work, and they themselves belong to a realm of being different from that of men. These Primordial Beings, moreover, not only molded the landscape; they also inserted in some places "spirit children" and "spirits" of various animals, brought forth from their own bodies. The epoch when the Supernatural Beings appeared and began * This is the second of a series of articles on "primitive" religions.

This mythical time is "sacred" be- cause it was sanctified by the real presence and the activity of the Supernatural Beings. But like all other species of "sacred time," although indefinitely remote, it is not inaccessible. It can be re- actualized through ritual. Moreover, it constitutes "a kind of charter of things that still happen, and a kind of logos or principle of order transcending everything significant for aboriginal man."2 Or, as Ronald and Catherine Berndt put it, "the mythological era ... is regarded as setting a precedent for all human behavior from that time on. It was the period when patterns of living were established, and laws laid down for human beings to follow."3 Everything which fully exists-a mountain, a water place, an institution, a custom-is acknowledged as real, valid, and mean- ingful because it came into being in the beginning. In a previous article we discussed the works of "creation" effected by the Sky Gods of the southeast Australian tribes; we also pointed out traces of a similar type of celestial divine Being in other parts of the continent. In southeast Australia, the origins are dominated by the creative activity of the Sky Gods ("All-Fathers"). We shall now examine at some length other Australian conceptions of the beginnings, in order to discover what type of Supernatural Beings dominated such fabulous, creative epochs. THE ARANDA MYTH OF ORIGINS According to the Aranda, the earth in the beginning was like a desolate plain, without hills or rivers, lying in eternal darkness. The sun, the moon, and the stars were still slumbering under the earth. There existed no plants or animals, only semi-embryonic masses of half-developed infants, lying helplessly at places which 2 W.

We have analyzed the structure and meaning of the necessity to relate all human behavior to paradigmatic precedents in our Myth of the Eternal Return (English trans., New York: Pantheon Books, 1954, reprinted as Cosmos and History: The Myth of the Eternal Return [New York: Harper &amp; Row, Pub- lishers, 1959]). 209</page><page sequence="3">Australian Religions: An Introduction were later to become salt lakes or water holes. These shapeless infants could not develop into individual men and women-but neither could they grow old or die. Indeed, neither life nor death was known on earth. "Only below the surface of the earth did life already exist in its fulness, in the form of thousands of uncreated supernatural beings that had always existed: but even these were still slumbering in eternal sleep."4 Finally these Supernatural Beings awakened from their sleep and broke through the surface of the earth. Their "birthplaces" were impregnated with their life and power. As the Sun too rose out of the ground, the earth was flooded with light. The Super- natural Beings that "had been born out of their own eternity" (altjirana nambakala) had various shapes and appearances. Some rose in animal forms, like kangaroos or emus; others emerged as perfectly formed men and women. "In most of these supernatural beings there was an indivisible linking between elements found in animals (or plants) on the one hand and in humans on the other. Those beings that looked like animals, for instance, generally thought and acted like humans; conversely, those in human form could change at will into the particular animal with which they were indivisibly linked."5 These Supernatural Beings, commonly designated "totemic Ancestors," began to wander on the surface of the earth, giving the central Australian landscape its actual physical features. Some of them assumed the functions of "Culture Heroes." They "sliced massed humanity into individual infants, then slit the webs be- tween their fingers and toes, and cut open their ears, eyes and mouths" (Strehlow, "Personal Monototemism," p. 728). Other Culture Heroes taught men how to make tools and fire and to cook food. When all these earthborn Supernatural Beings had accomplished their labors and completed their wanderings, "over- powering weariness fell upon them. The tasks that they had per- formed had taxed their strength to the utmost" (ibid., p. 728). Thus they sank back into their original slumbering state,6 and "their bodies either vanished into the ground (often at the site where they had first emerged) or turned into rocks, trees, or 4 T. G. H. Strehlow, "Personal Monototemism in a Polytotemic Community" (hereinafter cited as "Personal Monototemism), Festschrift far Ad. E.

The sites which marked their final resting places were, like their birthplaces, regarded as important sacred centres, and were called by the same name--mara kutata. Both kinds of pmara kutata could be approached only by initiated men, and only on special ceremonial occasions. At all other times they were places that had to be avoided on pain of death" (ibid., p. 729). The disappearance of the Supernatural Beings put an end to the mythical age, which-.-at least in the case of the Aranda-had a somehow paradisal character. Indeed, the Ancestors "were free from the multitude of inhibitions and frustrations that inevitably obstruct all human beings who are living together in organized communities. Nor were they accountable for their actions to any superior Power. For they were personages living in a world where the human notions of good and evil had but a shadowy meaning: they wandered around 'beyond the borders of good and evil,' as it were."7 This does not mean, however, that they were completely beyond all moral laws. T. G. H. Strehlow recalls certain myths showing that criminal acts did not remain unpunished.8 These primordial personages had a specific mode of being which, though different from that of men as they now exist, nonetheless constitutes its source and model. This is the reason for the imme- diate, "existential" interest of the Ancestors' myths for the Aranda-and also for their indifference to the Sky Beings. Indeed, unlike the Sky Beings, the Primordial Ancestors were subject to ageing and decay. But, unlike present-day men, they were immor- tal; even those who were "killed" by other totemic Ancestors have continued to live in the form of tchurungas. Nonetheless, before they finally sink into the earth, death has been brought into the world through some of their acts. Thus the first men come into existence in a world of labor, pain, and death.9 But the "life" that is left behind by the Ancestors throughout the land assures conti- nuity with the fabulous past. And what we call "religion" and religious activity is just that corpus of traditional techniques and 7 Ibid., p. 729. Cf. also T. G. H. Strehlow, Aranda Traditions (Melbourne, 1947), pp. 36 if. on "the Golden Age" of the totemic Ancestors. 8 Indeed, "there existed some indefinably nameless Force which was capable of bringing about the final downfall of even the most powerful supernatural beings that had believed themselves superior in strength to all possible opponents" (Strehlow, "Personal Monototemism," p. 729). 9 Ibid., p. 729. Cf. Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, pp. 42 ff., for the myth of the origin of death. The first dead had begun to emerge slowly from his grave when Urbura, the magpie, thrust a heavy spear into his neck and stamped him back into the ground with his heel, shouting: "remain rooted down firmly for all time; do not attempt to rise again; stay forever in the ground!" 211</page><page sequence="5">Australian Religions: An Introduction rituals by means of which the contemporary Aranda succeeds in keeping himself in communication with the mythological past of his tribe. As a matter of fact, this "communication with the mythical past" begins with the conception of every present-day man, that is, when the fetus receives the minute part of his totemic Ances- tor's "life" that constitutes his "immortal" soul. As Strehlow has recently pointed out, the Aranda believe that every human being possesses two souls: the first, the mortal soul, comes into being with the fetus, as a result of intercourse between the parents; the second soul, a particle of the Ancestor's "life," is received by the pregnant woman. It is this second, immortal, soul that gives his physical characteristics to the individual and also creates his entire personality (ibid., p. 730). Thus one can say that every new conception also reiterates the primordial activity of the Ancestors: in the beginning, they found an amorphous, prehuman mass which they transformed into real human beings; after the dis- appearance of the Ancestors, particles of their "life" (i.e., immortal souls) penetrate the fetus (which is animated by the mortal souls) and actually create the complete man. What is striking in this description of Strehlow's is the singular, one might almost say extravagant, mode of being of the Aranda's mythological Ancestors. Their ontological structure gives them a special place among the many types of Supernatural Beings known to the historian of religions. They are different from the celestial gods, although like them they are uncreated and im- mortal. Moreover, some of the earthborn Supernatural Beings- the Sun, Moon, and others-are said to have ascended to heaven and become planets and stars. This means that the earthborn "immortals" were able to become celestial immortals; they had only to climb to heaven. In the first article of this series we re- called certain traditions about such "climbing to heaven": in the beginning, communication with heaven was possible and even easy (by climbing a tree, a liana, a ladder); another myth clearly con- nects the origin of death to an interruption of the traffic between earth and heaven: two mythical Ancestors who had climbed to heaven afterward pulled up the spear and pronounced a death curse upon men (ibid., pp. 725-26). Thus one can say of the Aranda reports that there were originally three classes of Beings, all of them uncreated and immortal: (1) the celestial gods in heaven; (2) the Primordial Beings under the earth; (3) the Pri- mordial Proto-Men on the earth. They are different in that the 212</page><page sequence="6">last two classes of Beings have passed through an indefinite period of slumbering; moreover the last, the Primordial Proto-Men, although uncreated, knew only an "embryonic" immortality: when they truly became men through the anatomical operations performed by certain Culture Heroes, they lost their original condition of indefinite virtuality. The ontological originality of the totemic Ancestors is further emphasized by the fact that, though immortal, they were ex- hausted by their creative works and sank again under the earth- from where, strangely enough, they nevertheless can see and judge man's deeds. Moreover, as we shall see, they could be "killed" by men (of course, mythological, primordial men) and, as a result of this murder, at least a part of them (their "spirits") ascended to heaven and became celestial bodies and phenomena.10 Another characteristic of their mode of existence is their multiplicity and their simultaneous presence on the earth.ll An Ancestor exists simultaneously: (a) under the earth, (b) in various cosmic and ritual objects (rocks, waterfalls, tchurungas, etc.), (c) as "spirit children," and finally as (d) the man (or men) in which he is presently reincarnated. Now, it is a characteristic of religious thought in general, and of archaic thinking in particular, that Supernatural Beings are conceived as singular and unparalleled solutions of the unity-multiplicity problem. But what seems to be peculiar to the Australians is the mysterious connection between their land (i.e., mystical geography), the mythical history of that land (i.e., the deeds of the Ancestors), and man's responsibility for keeping the land "living" and fertile. All of this will become clearer as we proceed in our investigation. But we can already perceive that the ontological structure of the Primordial Beings (the mythical Ancestors) is so complex-more complex, for ex- ample, than that of the Sky Being (who is, in fact, a Supreme 10 Other myths tell how Primordial Beings climbed to Heaven by means of a lance and ultimately became celestial bodies. Cf. M. Eliade, "Notes on the Symbolism of the Arrow," to appear in the Festschrift for Erwin Goodenough. 11 "The body of the Ulamba ancestor is shown at many points of the route he once travelled: the main peak of Ulamba, the rock from which he sprang into life, the sharp hill near the mountain pass south of Ulamba, the great boulder which forms the lower portion of the Ulamba sacred cave, and many other rocks elsewhere, are, each one individually, stated to be 'the body of the Ulamba ancestor.' In addition, there is a tjuringa of him at Ulamba, and others in different storehouses, and the natives still would not have been troubled even for a moment by their number. The body of the tjilpa chief Malbanka is (or was) to be found, as far as I know, in form of a tjuringa in each one of the main caves which are to be found along the far-flung trail which he and his sons once travelled" (Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, pp. 28-29). 2-H.O.R. 213</page><page sequence="7">Australian Religions: An Introduction Being becoming a deus otiosus)-because they are involved in or incarnate the mysteries of life and fertility, of death and rebirth. NUMBAKULLA AND THE SACRED POLE To understand better the paradigmatic creativity of these Primor- dial Beings, we shall discuss a few examples. In general the myths represent the Ancestors as powerful and creative. They can fly above and walk beneath the earth. They travel everywhere, per- forming sacred ceremonies and depositing "spirit children" in the ground or in various natural features. But their myths are seldom exuberant or dramatic. For example, Spencer and Gillen tell the following story of Numbakulla, whose name means "always exist- ing" or "out of nothing." (This is one of the Supernatural Beings discussed by Strehlow [see p. 210 above], called altjirana namb- akala, "born out of their own eternity"). According to the tradi- tions of the Achilpa, one of the Aranda groups, Numbakulla arose "out of nothing" and traveled to the north, making mountains, rivers, and all sorts of animals and plants. He also created the "spirit children" (kuruna), a very large number of whom were concealed inside his body. Eventually he made a cave or store- house, to hide the tchurungas that he was producing. At that time men did not yet exist. He inserted a kuruna into a tchurunga, and thus there arose the first Achilpa (mythical) Ancestor. Numbakulla then implanted a large number of kuruna in different tchurunga, producing other mythical Ancestors. He taught the first Achilpa how to perform the many ceremonies connected with the various totems. Now, Numbakulla had planted a pole called Kauwa-auwa in the middle of a sacred ground. (A representation of this pole, made from the trunk of a young gum tree, is erected on the ceremonial ground during the long series of initiation rites known as the Engwura). After anointing it with blood, he began to climb it. He told the first Achilpa Ancestor to follow him; but the blood made the pole too slippery, and the man slid down. "Numbakulla went on alone, drew up the pole after him and was never seen again."12 12 Sir Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen, The Arunta. A Study of Stone Age People (London, 1927), I, 355 ff., esp. p. 360. Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, p. 78, quotes the west and south Aranda myth of the Ntjikantja Ancestors: the two brothers ascended into the sky by climbing up a tall spear (cf. above, p. 212). Spencer and Gillen, op. cit., pp. 307 ff., relate another myth: the two Numbakulla made men from a living, embryonic substance (inapatna). Such a "Creation" of 214</page><page sequence="8">This pole is charged with important symbolism and plays a central role in ritual. The fact that Numbakulla disappeared into the sky after climbing it suggests that the kauwa-auwa is somehow an axis mundi which unites heaven and earth. Elsewhere, and par- ticularly in the oriental cultures and the areas under their influ- ence, the axis mundi (conceived as a pillar, a tree, a mountain, etc.) actually constitutes a "center of the world." This implies, among other things, that it is a consecrated place from which all orientation takes place. In other words, the "center" imparts structure to the surrounding amorphous space. Both the Achilpa myth and the actual ceremonial use of the pole illustrate very well this double function of communication with heaven and means of orientation. The myth relates in seemingly endless detail the wanderings of the first Achilpa Ancestors after the disappear- ance of Numbakulla. They traveled continuously, in small groups, carrying out ceremonies, circumcising the young men, occasion- ally leaving one of them behind. When these mythical groups performed the Engwura rituals, the kauwa-auwa "was always erected and made to lean in the direction in which they intended to travel."13 In other words, the sacred pole helped them to chart the unknown space into which they were preparing to adventure. One day an accident befell one of these mythical groups: while pulling up the kauwa-auwa, which was very deeply implanted, the old chief broke it just above the ground. They carried the broken pole until they met another group. They were so tired and sad that they did not even try to erect their own kauwa-auwa "but, lying down together, died where they lay. A large hill, covered with big stones, arose to mark the spot."14 Seldom do we find a more pathetic avowal that man cannot live without a "sacred center" which permits him both to "cosmicize" space and to com- municate with the transhuman world of heaven. So long as they had their kauwa-auwa, the Achilpa Ancestors were never lost in the surrounding "chaos." Moreover, the sacred pole was for them the proof par excellence of Numbakulla's existence and activity. man by the metamorphosis of a prehuman element is indicated in the symbolic designs of the tchurungas; cf. L. Adam, "Anthromorphe Darstellungen auf aus- tralischen Ritualgeraten," Anthropos, LIII (1958), 1-50; see pp. 36 ff. 13 Spencer and Gillen, op. cit., p. 382. On the ceremonial pole, cf. Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, pp. 77 ff. 14 Spencer and Gillen, op. cit., p. 388. For the meaning of this myth and its related ritual, cf.

The world came into being as a result of their work. In some cases, the cosmogonic character of the Dream Time acti- vity is quite evident. This is true, for example, of the mythology of the Karadjeri tribe, which centers around the two brothers Bagadjimbiri. Before their appearance there was nothing at all- neither trees, nor animals, nor human beings. The brothers arose from the ground in the form of dingos, but they later became two "human" giants, their heads touching the sky. They emerged from the earth just before twilight on the first day. When they heard the cry of a little bird (duru) that always sang at that time, they knew it was twilight. Previously they had known nothing at all. The two brothers subsequently saw all kinds of animals and plants and gave them names. That is to say, from that moment, because they had names, the animals and plants began to really exist. Next the brothers saw a star and the moon and named them also. Then the Bagadjimbiri went toward the north. On their journey they encountered men and women without genital organs, and the brothers provided them with organs made from a species of mush- room. They threw a pirmal (a long stick) at an animal and killed it; the Karadjeri found the stick and have performed the same act ever since. The two brothers founded the initiation ceremonies and utilized for the first time the ritual instruments: a stone cir- cumcision knife, the bull-roarer, and the long pirmal. They saw a snake and sang the song for the production of snakes. Then they differentiated the dialects. The two Bagadjimbiri had a great deal of hair, some of which they pulled out and gave to every tribe. (Thus every tribe now possesses a corporeal particle of the Heroes.) But a certain man killed the brothers with a spear. Their mother, Dilga, who was far away, detected the odor of corpses upon the wind. Milk streamed forth from her breasts and flowed underground to the place where the brothers lay dead. There it gushed like a torrent, drowning the murderer and reviving the two brothers. The two Bagadjimbiri later transformed themselves into water snakes, while their spirits became the Magellanic Clouds.15 15 Ralph Piddington, "Karadjeri Initiation," Oceania, III (1932-33), 46-87; idem, An Introduction to Social Anthropology (Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1950), pp. 91-105. The murder of Bagadjimbiri may be connected with another Australian 216</page><page sequence="10">This myth constitutes the foundation of all Karadjeri life. During initiation the ceremonies instituted by the two Bagad- jimbiri are re-enacted, although the meaning of some of the rituals is no longer clear to the aborigines. This mythical pattern is well known in different parts of Australia: the epiphany of the Culture Heroes, their wanderings and their civilized activities, their final disappearance. As we shall see, every act of the Heroes (Ancestors) is duly repeated by the members of the tribe. As Strehlow put it: "All occupations originated with the totemic an- cestors; and here, too, the native follows tradition blindly: he clings to the primitive weapons used by his forefathers, and no thought of improving them ever enters his mind."16 But of course this is true only up to a certain point: the Australians, like other primitives, have changed their lives in the course of history; but all such changes are considered to be new "revelations" of Super- natural Beings. A MYTHICAL GEOGRAPHY Through the initiation rites the neophyte is gradually introduced to the tribal traditions; he discovers all that happened ab origine. This "knowledge" is total-that is to say, mythical, ritual, and geographic. In learning what took place in the Dream Time, the initiate also learns what must be done in order to maintain the living and productive world. Moreover, a mythical-or mystical- geography is revealed to him: he is introduced to the innumerable sites where the Supernatural Beings performed rituals or did signi- ficant things. The world in which the initiate henceforth moves is a meaningful and "sacred" world, because Supernatural Beings have inhabited and transformed it. Thus it is always possible to be "oriented" in a world that has a sacred history, a world in which every prominent feature is associated with a mythical event. W. E. H. Stanner writes, with regard to the Murinbata mythical geography: "The Murinbata considered the countryside filled with plain evidence that the dramas had occurred. The places of climax were known and named, and each one contained mythical theme: a Culture Hero "kills" the young man during the initiation and is finally himself slain by the surviving members of the tribe; cf. B. Spencer, Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia (London, 1914), pp. 214 ff., 270 ff., 295-305. 16 Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, p. 35. 217</page><page sequence="11">Australian Religions: An Introduction proof-a shape, or form, or pattern of a great event."17 Likewise Spencer and Gillen, relating their journey to an important totemic center in the company of a small group of natives, disclose for us the mythical geography of the Warramunga tribe. A range of hills marked the path traversed by the mythical Ancestor of the bat totem. A column of rock represented another Ancestor, the opossum man; a low range of white quartzite hills indicated the white ant eggs thrown there in the Dream Time by some mythical women. "All the time, as we travelled along, the old men were talking amongst themselves about the natural features associated in tradition with these and other totemic ancestors of the tribe, and pointing them out to us."l8 And thus, during the three days of the journey, they passed near innumerable tangible traces of the Primordial totemic (cultural) Heroes. Finally they approached the famous waterhole where the mythical snake Wollunka lived. Near the sacred pool the natives "became very quiet and solemn," and "the chief men of the totemic group went down to the edge of the water and, with bowed heads, addressed the Wollunka in whispers, asking him to remain quiet and do them no harm, for they were mates of his.... We could plainly see that it was all very real to them, and that they implicitly believed that the Wollunka was indeed alive beneath the water, watching them, though they could not see him."19 One must read the descriptions of Spencer and Gillen in extenso to understand why even the most dreary landscape is, for the aborigines, charged with awe: every rock, spring, and water hole represents a concrete trace of a sacred drama carried out in the mythical times. For the Western reader, these endless wander- ings20 and fortuitous meetings of the Dream Time Heroes seem excessively monotonous. (But then the wanderings of Leopold Bloom in Ulysses also seem monotonous for the admirer of Balzac or Tolstoi.) For the aborigines, the vestiges of the mythical drama are more than a cipher or stencil enabling him to read the sacred stories imprinted in the landscape. They reveal to him a 17 W. E. H. Stanner, On Aboriginal Religion ("Oceania Monographs," No. 11, [Sydney, 1963]), p. 254. 18 B. Spencer and F. J. Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia (London, 1904), p. 249. 19 Ibid., pp. 252-53. 20 The theme of the wanderings of the Ancestors appears to be characteristic of Australian mythology, but it is not exclusively Australian. It is found, for ex- ample, among the Californian Mohave (Yuman tribe); cf. A. L. Kroeber, Hand- book of the Indians of California (Bureau of American Ethnology, Bull. LXXVIII [Washington, D.C., 1925]), pp. 754-57; idem, "Seven Mohave Myths," Anthro- pological Records, XI, No. 1 (1948), 4-8. 218</page><page sequence="12">history in which he is existentially involved. Not only is he the result of those endless wanderings and performances of the mythical Ancestors; in many cases he is the reincarnation of one of those Ancestors. As T. G. H. Strehlow puts it: "The whole countryside is his living, age-old family tree. The story of his own totemic ancestor is to the native the account of his own doings at the beginning of time, at the dim dawn of life, when the world as he knows it now was being shaped and moulded by all-powerful hands. He himself has played a part in that first glorious adventure, a part smaller or greater according to the original rank of the ancestor of whom he is the present reincarnated form." [italics mine].21 Learning the mythical history of the familiar countryside, the initiate experiences a sort of anamnesis: he remembers his coming into being in the primordial time and his most remote deeds: "At the time of birth the totemic ancestor who has undergone rein- carnation is totally unaware of his former glorious existence. For him the preceding months have been a 'sleep and a forgetting'. If he is born as a boy, the old men will later on initiate him and re- introduce him into the ancient ceremonies which he himself had instituted in his previous existence."22 Through his initiation, the novice discovers that he has already been here, in the beginning; he was here under the appearance of the mythical Ancestor. In learning the deeds of his mythical Ancestor, he learns about his own glorious pre-existence. Ultimately, he is taught to repeat himself such as he was ab origine; that is to say, he is to imitate his own exemplary model. We shall have an opportunity to take up this problem again in the course of our investigation. For the moment, it seems relevant for us to point out the Platonic structure of the Australian doc- trine of anamnesis. As is well known, for Plato learning is recollect- ing; to know is to remember (cf. Meno 81). Between two existences on earth, the soul contemplates the Ideas: it shares in pure and perfect knowledge. But when the soul is reincarnated, it drinks of the spring of Lethe and forgets the knowledge it had obtained from its direct contemplation of the Ideas. Yet this knowledge is latent in the man in whom the soul is reincarnated, and it can be made patent by philosophical effort. Physical objects help the soul to withdraw into itself and, through a sort of "going back," to 21 Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, pp. 30-31. 22 Ibid., p. 93. 219</page><page sequence="13">Australian Religions: An Introduction rediscover and repossess the original knowledge that it had pos- sessed in its extra-terrestrial condition. Hence death is the return to a primordial and perfect state, which is periodically lost through the soul's reincarnation.23 Of course, there can be no question of assimilating the Austra- lian conception to Plato's doctrine of anamnesis. But it is signifi- cant that the belief in the perpetual reincarnation of the Ancestors has forced the Aranda to elaborate a theory of anamnesis fairly close to that of Plato. For Plato as well as for the Aranda, physical objects help the soul to remember his real identity. With this difference: for Plato, the soul through death is able to contem- plate the Ideas, and thus to partake in Knowledge. For the Aranda, the knowledge in question is not philosophical but mythi- cal and "historical": that which the novice discovers through initiation is what he did in illo tempore; he learns not ideas but his own primordial deeds and their meaning. He discovers in the mythology of a certain Hero his own fabulous biography. Certain physical objects (rocks, tchurungas, etc.) reveal themselves as proofs of his first and glorious existence on earth. For Plato, the physical objects help the soul to recover the knowledge of his extra-terrestrial condition. But for both Plato and the Aranda, the true anamnesis is the effect of a spiritual activity: philosophy for the Greek philosopher, initiation for the Australians. THE RITUALS THAT "RE-CREATE" THE WORLD Thus the Aranda geography reveals a structure and a meaning because it is charged with mythical history. Even the geographical orientation is related to a mythical history. The aborigines follow the paths marked out by the Supernatural Beings and the mythical Ancestors. They seldom approach a sacred site by the shortest route; rather they deem it necessary to walk on the same path taken by the Supernatural Being connected with it.24 The mythical history that transformed a "chaotic land" into a sacred and arti- culated world helps, moreover, to bind together groups and tribes. The paths pass through the "worlds" of different tribes, and be- tween these tribes there is a "secret bond of friendship and a mutual claim to hospitality and protection."25 The members of a cult group can travel safely along the path of the Hero even in 23 M. Eliade, Myth and Reality (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1963), p. 124. 24 Elkin, op. cit., p. 153. 25 Ibid. 220</page><page sequence="14">other tribal territories. Each cult group is the custodian of a par- ticular episode of the myth and of the particular rites associated with it. "But as continuity with the past, a full knowledge of social and ritual sanctions, and a complete assurance for the present and future can only be maintained and gained by a knowl- edge of the myth as a whole and the performance of all the rites, it is essential that each 'lodge' should do its part. Thus the groups and tribes are linked together by the cult-life."26 Though apparently confined to familiar territory, the "world" of a tribe is conceived as being all-embracing. Owing to the Austral- ian kinship system, everybody is-or can be-related to everybody else. If a friendly stranger approaches a camp, he is always finally recognized as being related to someone of the group. Consequently, for the Australians, only one "world" and only one "human society" exist. The unknown regions outside familiar lands do not belong to the "world"-just as unfriendly or mysterious foreigners do not belong to the community of men, for they may be ghosts, demonic beings, or monsters. But the "world" must be kept alive and productive. By them- selves, men have no power to "save" the world, to keep it indefi- nitely as it was "in the beginning," full of useful plants and ani- mals, with creeks and rivers and with the rains coming at the right time. But men have been instructed to do what the Supernatural Beings and Heroes did during the Dream Time period. All of the ceremonies are only reiterations of these paradigmatic acts. The ritual reactualization of the mythical history reactivates commu- nication with the Dream Time, regenerates life, and assures its continuation. In short, the ritual "re-creates" the world. The wanderings and the actions of the Ancestral Heroes are re-enacted in long and tedious ceremonies. The so-called increase ceremonies (intichiuma), which center about the vegetable and animal foods-yams or lily roots, kangaroos, snakes, birds-assure the renewal of the species through a ritual repetition of their creation in the Dream Time. The renewal of the edible species, animal and vegetable, is tanta- mount to a "world renewal." This should not surprise us, for the "world" is first of all the land where the man lives, where he finds his food and shelter. As we shall later discover in a more detailed way, alimentation has a sacramental value. In absorbing his food, the "primitive" partakes in the sacredness of the world. Living as 26 Ibid., p. 124. 221</page><page sequence="15">Australian Religions: An Introduction a human being is in itself a religious act. For men assume the re- sponsibility of preserving the world as it was made by the Super- natural Beings, periodically regenerating the world through rituals, and especially through the "increase cememonies." Some of these increase ceremonies are slight and mechanical, others, on the contrary, are quite dramatic.27 For example, it has happened that a particular mythical Being performed increase ceremonies at a certain site, leaving a stone as storehouse for a specific animal life or spirit. "Another place on his journey might have been sanctified and made efficacious by the loss of some of his blood or part of his body, or by his body being transformed into stone. Such a site is henceforth sacred. It is a channel from the creative and eternal dream-time. The creative power is brought into operation and causes the increase, for example, of kangaroos, by the care bestowed on, and the rituals performed at, the site."28 The performers say: "Let there be plenty of kangaroos here and there." But they also "blow powder from the stone, throw stones from the sacred heap, or take a mixture of powdered stone or earth and blood from the sacred place and deposit it in the countries where an increase of the species is desired and should normally occur.... The sacred stone or heap is not, for them, just stone or earth. It is in a sense animated; life can go forth from it."29 As we shall later see, the various acts of the "increase" ritual reiterate exactly the gestures of the Ancestors. REDEEMING SYMBOLS The increase ceremonies are apparently simple and monotonous. But for the initiates a seeming simplicity sometimes hides a very complex symbolism. And this is true of all Australian rituals. To give a single example: in northeastern Arnhem Land an emblem signifying a goanna's tail and vertebrae is ritually exhibited during a certain ceremony. Totemic designs are painted down its trunk, and feathered pendants attached. Slowly the actor removes it from its shade, posturing as he does so; he writhes along the ground, holding the sacred stick close to his breast. Singing continues; he is revealing one of the mysteries to participant-onlookers, all highly-initiated men. What does this mean? Here is an emblem which is a symbol of a 27 R. M. and C. H. Berndt, op. cit., pp. 227-31. See the elaborate description of the intichiuma ceremonies in Spencer and Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia, pp. 167 ff., 283 ff. See also below, p. 235. 28 Elkin, op. cit., p. 199. 29 Ibid., p. 200. 222</page><page sequence="16">goanna's tail and vertebrae, withdrawn from its shade. But to the neophyte it is much more than this. The shade or hut symbolizes a special conically-shaped mat, brought by the Djanggawul Fertility Mothers from a spirit land away in the sunrise, beyond the Morning Star. This mat is really a womb. When the goanna tail emblem is removed from it on the sacred ground, this signifies that the first people, ancestors of the present-day eastern Arnhem Landers, are being born from their Mother; and they, in turn, are associated with a combination of fertility symbols. Actually, there is symbol within sym- bol, meaning within meaning, much of it connected with fundamental drives.30 We meet here some new religious ideas (the Mother, the womb), about which we shall have more to say. But this example shows us how, in the guise of a very simple ritual, a rich mythology can be disclosed to the initiates and, consequently, how the connection with a spiritual world is maintained and reinforced. The disclosure of the sacred history of the tribe sometimes takes many years. Step by step, the individual becomes aware of the greatness of the mythical past. He learns how to re-live the Dream Time through the ceremonies. Eventually he shall be completely im- mersed in the sacred history of his tribe; that is to say, he shall know the origin and understand the meaning of everything from rocks, plants, and animals to customs, symbols, and rules. As he assimilates the revelation conserved in the myths and rituals, the world, life, and human existence become meaningful and sacred- for they have been created or perfected by Supernatural Beings. At a certain moment in his life, a man discovers that before his birth he was a spirit and that after his death he is to be reintegra- ted into that prenatal, spiritual condition. He learns that the human cycle is part of a larger, cosmic cycle; the Creation was a "spiritual" act which took place in the Dream Time, and, although the cosmos is now "real" or "material," it nonetheless must be periodically renewed by the reiteration of the creative acts that occurred in the beginning. This renovation of the world is a spiritual deed, the result of a reinforcing communication with the "Eternal Ones" of the Dream Time. In a similar fashion, human existence begins and ends-pro- visorily-in a spiritual world. As the Berndts put it: "To begin with, the essence of man or woman is purely spiritual. After birth ... it takes on a materialistic form: but it never loses its sacred quality. Woman possesses this sacredness almost without any effort-especially in such places as northeastern Arnhem Land: 30 R. M. and C. H. Berndt, The First Australians (Sydney, 1952), pp. 78-79. 223</page><page sequence="17">Australian Religions: An Introduction but for man the accent is on ritual, and organized ceremony. For both, sacredness increases with advancing age; and at death they become, again, completely spiritual."31 Should the sacred ceremonies be neglected and the social cus- toms despised, the world will regress to the darkness and chaos that existed before the "Dream Time" and the coming of the Supernatural Beings.32 As a matter of fact, the "world" of the aborigines has already been almost destroyed by acculturation, and the survivors linger on in a life of frustration and sterility. "A camp without ceremonies, where moonlit evenings are silent, or broken only by the muttering of the card-players or a sudden burst of quarreling, is a camp where the people's zest for living has been lost or diverted into other or less satisfying channels. Where sacred ritual has been allowed to lapse, people no longer maintain conscious contact with their own traditions and back- ground: and once this vital link has been broken, the whole course of their lives must reflect the change."33 Of course this is not yet the physical destruction of the cosmos presaged by the myths. But the result is almost the same: as the old "world" created or perfected by the Supernatural Beings becomes meaningless through acculturation, it is progressively obliterated. The survivors of this spiritual cataclysm will have to rebuild their culture with other means and new materials. The crystallization of a new Australian culture is still a thing of the future. But the degeneration and ruin of traditional values as a result of encounters with Western culture is a general phenemenon among "primitives." We shall have many occasions to point out the distortion, the hybridization, and the oblivion undergone by the most archaic religious ideas and beliefs. We shall also have an opportunity to analyze some new religious and cultural creations, born from the tragic encounter with Western values. For the moment it suffices for us to emphasize the Australian's need to live in a real "world." This means an articulated, signifi- cant, resourceful land, formed, enriched, and consecrated by Supernatural Beings. Such a "world" has a "center" or a structure -and for this reason it is "oriented," it is not a chaos, an amor- phous, bewildering vacuity. The coming into being of the world, of plants and animals and men, is the result of a sacred history 31 Ibid., p. 59. 32 Cf. Helmut Petri, "Das Weltende im Glauben australischer Eingeborenen," Paideuma, IV (1950), 349-62. 33 R. M. and C. H. Berdt, The First Australians, pp. 98-99. 224</page><page sequence="18">scrupulously preserved in the myths and periodically reiterated in the secret ceremonies. This implies not only that the world has a "history"-a sacred history unfolded during the Dream Time- but also that man has assumed the responsibility for maintaining the world, by continuously re-enacting the stupendous events of the beginning and by endlessly infusing the land with the powers of "Dreaming." When man ceases to communicate with the Dream Time and to re-enact his mythical history, the world will disintegrate and life will wither, to disappear eventually from the surface of the earth. Again and again we shall encounter Australian religious crea- tions which have sprung forth from such fundamental conceptions. But they are never exactly the same. From tribe to tribe, from culture to culture, there are significant variants, shifts of perspec- tive, brilliant innovations. No living culture is able to repeat itself indefinitely, for the simple reason that no culture endures in absolute isolation. The meeting of cultures, even of kindred forms which have issued from the same matrix, always provokes creative, if sometimes minute, innovations. Thus there exists no culture without history, without changes and transformations brought on by external influences. But this "history" is not acknowledged as such by the primitives; although they are aware of the modifications that have taken place in a more or less remote past, they telescope these modifications into a primordial and ahistorical time and interpret them as the acts of mythical Beings. In sum, by the simple fact that the innovation has been accepted and absorbed into the traditional pattern, it is considered to have taken place in the Dream Time period. THEOGONY and MYTHOLOGY OF THE UNAMBAL We shall now present, in some detail, the religious traditions of the Unambal, a tribe of northwest Australia. The German ethnologist Andreas Lommel has recently published a clear and well-articu- lated monograph on these people,34 whose mythology and religious customs differ in several respects from the patterns found in southeast and central Australia. These differences illustrate the complexity and richness of the Australian religious experience. But they are also important for another reason: they reflect 34 Andreas Lommel, Die Unambal. Ein Stamm in Nordwest-Australien (Ham- burg, 1952). 225</page><page sequence="19">Australian Religions: An Introduction certain historical changes, which we shall consider at the end of our investigation. The Unambal begin any narrative related to their life, their customs, or their myths by recounting the beginnings of the world. This is a practice found among many other primitive peoples and shows the importance of the creative happenings of the primordial time. Thus, in the beginning, say the Unambal, only earth and heaven existed. Deep in the earth lived-and even now lives- Ungud, in the form of a great snake. Ungud is often identified with the earth, but also with the waters. In the sky lives Wallan- ganda, who is lord of heaven and at the same time personifies the Milky Way. Wallanganda is supposed "to have made everything." He threw water on the earth, but Ungud "made the water deep," and so it started to rain. Thus began life on earth.35 Together, Wallanganda and Ungud created everything, but only during the night, as the outcome of a creative dream. Ungud transformed himself-or herself, for Ungud can be of either sex or even bisexual-into the Beings which he dreamt. Similarly, Wallanganda "dreamed" the Beings which he begot. He threw out from heaven a "spiritual force" and shaped it into images. Afterward, he projected these images, painted red, white, and black, onto the rocks and caves, where they can still be seen. This, according to the Unambal, was the origin of the painted images of plants and animals. These pictures also constitute the "spiritual centers" of the Beings which they represent. The relation between the images and the Beings depicted is said to be that of "father and brothers." Only after molding the "spiritual force" of the Beings into their respective images did Wallanganda make them in concreto and send them all over the land. Wallanganda painted the beings without mouth or eyes (these organs were later given by Ungud). Wallanganda continues to beget, incessantly, sending "spiritual germs" on the earth. He does not let his creatures die.36 On the rocks and cave walls, by the side of the reproductions of plants and animals, there are also anthropomorphic images, with- out mouths, which are called Wondjina. They personify the rain. According to the Unambal, the Wondjina were first found by Ungud, in a "creative dream," at the bottom of the waters. For 35 Ibid., p. 10. 36 Ibid., pp. 11-12. According to other versions of the myth, it was not Wallan- ganda who made the rock paintings but the bird Kujon, at his order. Wallan- ganda projected from heaven the "spiritual force" of the Beings, and Kujon painted them gradually as he grasped these messages in his creative dream. Cf. ibid., p. 12. 226</page><page sequence="20">this reason, every river, lake, or well belongs to a specific Wond- jina image located in the neighborhood. Immediately after coming into being the Wondjina went forth upon the earth, bringing the rains and changing the landscape, making hills and plains.37 While "the stones were still wet," the Wondjina built great "stone houses." (This, incidentally, indicates a megalithic tradition, about which more will be said later.) Then the Wondjina lay down on the "wet rocks," and their "impressions" produced the first rock paintings. The Wondjina entered the earth where their images are found today; they have subsequently lived under the earth, in the waters belonging to the rock paintings. There they incessantly create new "child germs." According to the Unambal, every man begins as a "child germ," called jallala. His father finds him in a dream and in another dream projects him into his wife. This jallala is in fact a portion of a Wondjina living in a certain water place; but it is equally a fragment of Ungud. When a jallala takes human form it is called jajaru and represents the "Ungud part" of the individual, or that portion of his soul which is descended from Ungud. Often the jajaru is said to be located in the kidneys; at death it goes back to the water hole and there awaits a new incarnation.38 There is a close relationship between a man and his place of "spiritual" origin. Generally speaking, one is always descended from the same Wondjina and the same water place as one's father. Thus there is always a certain number of individuals sharing the same spiritual origin. They are the rightful possessors of the region in which the water place and its respective Wondjina image are located. The oldest individual is considered to be the proper incar- nation of the Wondjina. In speaking of his Wondjina this old man uses the first person: "As I came along in the Dream Time and I left my impression on the rock...." He has the duty of repainting periodically, before the rainy season, the image of the Wondjina on the rock wall. He says: "I am going now to refresh and invigo- rate myself; I paint myself anew, so that the rain can come." He uses red ochre, white and yellow colors, and charcoal. After finishing his repainting he takes some water into his mouth and blows it on the rock image. In this manner, says the Unambal, the Wondjina brought rain in the Dream Time. 37 See other myths about the Wondjina in ibid., pp. 15 ff. Cf. also below, p. 232. 38 Lommel, op. cit., p. 13. A man is supposed to have other souls, whose origin is unknown to the present-day Unambal. One of these souls is the "shadow" which, after death, goes to the land of the dead and preserves there a sort of post- existence. See also ibid., p. 39 (the destiny of the souls after death). 227</page><page sequence="21">Australian Religions: An Introduction Near the anthropomorphic Wondjina are images representing plants and animals. As a matter of fact, the plant and animal totems are derived from the same "spiritual" source as man. Thus the aborigines live in an organic relationship with all nature. When mankind dies, the Wondjina will also die, and therefore the animals will no longer increase, the rain will no longer fall, and the vegetation will dry up. In short, the "world" will regress to the pre-creation "chaos." Like many other Australian tribes the Unambal not only are divided into two exogamous classes but also apply this "dualistic" system to the entire world, spiritual as well as natural. From prim- eval times, Ungud, Wondjinas, men, animals, and plants have belonged to one of two classes. The classes are named after the cranelike bird Kuranguli and the wild turkey Banar. These mythical birds are two Culture Heroes, who, after taking human form, founded all the rules and institutions. Everything that they did in the mythical time must be done again and again by the Unambal. The myth of the Culture Heroes somewhat parallels that of Wallanganda and Ungud. It is said that they came from heaven, that they are self-created, that they are the two Ungud snakes. Moreover, the first Wondjinas were nothing other than forms of the Culture Heroes. From them the first men descended; the first Ungud souls were made by them. Kurangali is more beautiful and more intelligent than Banar, who is in fact rather stupid. For this reason, they frequently enter into conflict39-a mythological theme that is widely diffused. Through the initiation rites, particularly the rites of circum- cision and subincision, the adolescent is progressively introduced into this mythical tradition. As everywhere else in Australia, men immerse themselves more deeply in the world of myths as they grow older. The medicine man is the main factor in renewing communication with the primeval times. His role in the spiritual life of the tribe is considerable. In the medicine man the creativity of the Dream Time is kept alive. While in extasis he is able to send his soul to Ungud. We shall learn more of his powers when we discuss the problem of the Australian medicine man. UNAMBAL AND UNGARINYIN As is the case with every other Australian tribe, one can discern in the Unambal traditions some basic common elements, which 39 Ibid., p. 20. 228</page><page sequence="22">can be considered pan-Australian, persisting side by side with more specific conceptions and beliefs. It suffices for us to examine the traditions of the neighboring Ungarinyin in order to see how the religious conceptions vary from one tribe to the next. Fundamen- tally, the Unambal and the Ungarinyin partake of the same religious pattern. But it appears that some beliefs have been either lost or radically modified by the Ungarinyin; or such variant beliefs can be interpreted as innovations introduced by the Unambal into an earlier pattern common to both tribes. Like the Unambal and other Australian groups, the Ungarinyin believe in a mythical primordial time (ldlan), when creation took place.40 The Ungarinyin also know Ungud (the Rainbow Serpent) and the anthropomorphic and celestial Walangala; but the struc- tures and functions of these figures are different. Walangala is not a creator. The Ungarinyin believe that the Creation is the work of Ungud and the Wondjina. Ungud sent the sweet water from heaven and created the first ancestral couple in the waters. Walangala can be considered as both a celestial god and a Culture Hero. He founded all the social and cultural institutions-and particularly the initiation rituals. The neophyte is taught the myths of Walangala during the most secret phase of the ceremony. Walangala is now in heaven; he sends the spirit children and watches to see whether the rules prescribed by him in the ldlan time are being respected. If they are not, Walangala will send a flood. In short, Ungud is the creator of life in all of nature, and Walangala is the author of the spiritual part of man. But one cannot say that Walangala is an anthropomorphic Sky God and Ungud a theriomorphic primeval deity. Ungud, too, ascended to heaven at the end of the primordial time. And some myths assert that Walangala was anthropomorphic while on earth but became a serpent in heaven. As Helmut Petri has noted,41 this is not felt as a contradiction by the aborigines. Many Wondjina take on a serpentine aspect at the end of Creation, without losing their anthropomorphic qualities.42 Many things remain obscure about Walangala. He can certainly be compared with the celestial Supreme Beings ("All-Fathers") of 40 Helmut Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien (Braunschweig, 1954), pp. 98 ff. 41 Ibid., p. 116. 42 We have here one of the most archaic expressions of the snake as the symbol of virtuality. 229</page><page sequence="23">Australian Religions: An Introduction the southeastern tribes; but no prayers are addressed to him (as is the case with Mungan-ngaua and Baiame), and nothing is said of his omniscience or his benevolence. It is possible, as Petri sug- gests,43 that an original creative deity has split into two divine personages, but we do not have the necessary data to deal with this problem. Directly related to Walangala is another Sky Hero, Ngunyari, who plays an important role in the initiation ceremonies. Nguin- yari is supposed to have made the bull-roarers "with his blood and elbows" and to have put his voice in them. He also painted the bull-roarer with lightning motifs-which is another way of saying that the bull-roarer is the thunderbolt. Ngunyari deter- mined all the injunctions having to do with the bull-roarers (they must be hidden in caves, far from women and children, etc.).44 After a series of wanderings, during which he revealed the myster- ies of the bull-roarer to the aborigines, he ascended to the sky by means of a ladder. Now his shadow can be seen near Walangala, on the Milky Way.45 Ngunyari is still remembered by the old men of the tribe, but his bull-roarer and its cult already belong to the past. They were supplanted by another type of bull-roarer, similar in form to the central-Australian tchurunga. These bull-roarers "belong" to a new cult, Kurangara, about which more will be said later.46 There are also other Culture Heroes: Banar and Kuranguli, known also by the Unambal; Wodoi and Djungun, two small night birds who, after their work in the primeval time, ascended to heaven and became the two stars Alpha and Beta Gemini;47 many mythical Ancestors; and finally Kalura, who is associated 43 Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien, p. 116. 44Ibid., pp. 119ff. 45 Ibid., p. 118. A. Capell found the Ngfinyari myth also among the Unambal and the Gwiini, but without the story of his wanderings in the west; cf. "Mytho- logy in Northern Kimberley, North-West Australia," Oceania, IX (1939), 382- 402; see p. 396. 46 Petri thinks that, among the Ungarinyin, Nginyari and the bull-roarers are of recent origin. They were introduced from the East. But it is impossible for us to know what type of cult objects were previously in use and supplanted by Ngunyari and his bull-roarers. The aborigines, naturally, assert that Ngfnyari and the bull-roarers were with them "from the very beginnings" (Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien, p. 128). 47 Like Bdnar and Kurdnguli, these two Heroes are different and antagonistic: one does everything in the correct way, the other one is stupid and inefficient. They fought together and W6doi killed Djungun, from whose blood ochre originated. 230</page><page sequence="24">with rain and with spirit children and can be considered the last important figure of the mythical lore of the tribe.48 We see, then, how the traditions of two neighboring tribes can vary. We also see how a cult can disappear almost under our eyes to be replaced by a more dramatic and aggressive one (Kuran- gara); this process must be kept in mind in analyzing the different layers of the Australian religions. But for the moment another feature commands our attention-a feature which, though charac- teristic of the Unambal and Ungarinyin, is not limited to them. We have noted that the structure and function of Walangala is repeated in Ngunyari and in other Culture Heroes. All of them are supposed to have founded the tribal culture and especially to have revealed the initiation rites. One has the impression that a specific paradigmatic model is being repeated again and again, as if a certain type of mythological figure and a certain religious function must be continuously reactualized, made present, active, and efficient. We shall encounter the same phenomenon in other primitive cultures. Related to this process of reproducing the type and function of a Supernatural Being in a series of successive personages, one notes a contrary process of reintegrating a multitude of mythical persons in a single divine figure. The Ungarinyin believe that at the end of the Dream Time the Wondjina entered the earth and became Ungud. Thus Ungud, the serpent, is conceived both as a unity and as the totality of an indefinite number of Wondjina.49 From a certain point of view one might speak of the procession or emanation of a divine principle, followed by the reintegration of these multiple hypostatizations. Even if this process were the result of the mingling of two or more cults, originally unrelated, the fact remains that the aborigines were able to deal successfully with such a paradoxical theory. The conception of Ungud as being simultaneously a unity and a totality of numberless separate individuals is not exceptional among the Australians. We have already noted that the Aranda point to the body of their mythical ancestor in all of the places where he traveled. They believe "in the simultaneous presence of the ancestor at each of the many scenes which once witnessed the fulness of his supernatural powers."50 48 Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien, pp. 132 ff., 139 ff. 49 Ibid., p. 147. Cf. also T. Herndndez, "Myths and Symbols of the Drysdale River Aborigines," Oceania, XXXII (1961-62), 113-27, for similar conceptions of the Ungur and Wondjina (Galoru) among a population of northern Kimberley. 50 Strehlow, Aranda Traditions, p. 29. 231</page><page sequence="25">Australian Religions: An Introduction THE WONDJINA AND THE RAINBOW SERPENT Most of the beliefs of the Unambal and the Ungarinyin are also to be found, with the inevitable variations, among the other tribes of northern Kimberley and Arnhem Land. The paintings of the caves and rock shelters of northern Kimberley51 both depict the mythology of the tribe and at the same time serve as a means for reanimating the contact with the Dream Time. Each gallery in- cludes representations of various species of animals and at least one anthropomorphic Being, the Wondjina. The Wondjinas are associated with sky, rain, the Rainbow Serpent, spirit children, and fertility. Capell describes them as "superhuman beings (male or female) whose homes are in caves," who "possess life-giving powers associated with waters," and who are related to the Rain- bow Serpent, which is considered by Capell to represent a later religious creation.52 But the structural continuity of all these mythological figures is also demonstrated by the etymologies of their names. E. A. Worms has proved that the terms wondjina, ungur, and ungud are all connected with the widely found Aus- tralian and Tasmanian root wan-, wun-, win-, "water." Wondjina 51 On March 26 and 27, 1838, Lieutenant George Grey discovered two caves containing paintings (cf. the description and colored sketches in his Journals of Two Expeditions of Discoveries (London, 1841), I, 201-4, 213-15). Many other caves with similar rock paintings were explored, described, and photographed by F. S. Brockman (1901), H. Basedow (1916), and W. R. Easton (1921). In 1928, A. P. Elkin visited three sets of cave and rock-shelter paintings of the Ungarinyin and for the first time presented in a coherent way their relations to the religious, economic, and social life of the tribe; cf. A. P. Elkin, "Rock Paintings of North- West Australia," Oceania, I (December, 1930), 257-79; idem, Studies in Australian Totemism ("Oceania Monographs," No. 2 [Sydney, 1933]), pp. 67-73. Grey's caves were found again in June, 1947, by H. Coate; cf. A. P. Elkin, "Grey's Northern Kimberley Cave-Paintings Re-found," Oceania, XIX (September, 1948), 1-15. Coate was able to collect some information from the natives in regard to these two caves. The first one seems to be connected with sexual relations and Wondjina (Elkin, "Grey's Northern Kimberley Cave-Paintings Re-found," p. 9); the second, discovered by Grey on March 27, belongs to another mythological tradition, namely, that of Galaru, the Rainbow Serpent (ibid., pp. 10-11).

Elkin has observed that, among the Ungarinyin, the name Ungud refers to the mythical time and to the Rainbow Serpent; but it is also equivalent to Wondjina.54 "The Wondjina paintings are therefore efficacious because they are Ungud, because they were instituted by Ungud, or in the Ungud time."55 According to Petri,56 the Ungarinyin have three names or concepts for the personages of the primeval times: Ungur, Ungud, and Wondjina. The aborigines consider Ungur and Ungud to be similar to the Wondjina; but they are "more boss" than the Wondjina. It is probable that Ungur refers to the primordial time when Ungud, the Rainbow Serpent, carried out the Creation. The Wondjina are the Heroes and lawgivers57 who came forth from Ungud and who continued the Creation at the Ungud sites. Ungud is invisible to all human beings, except for the medicine man. The ban-man ("Ungud doctor") not only can see Ungud; he speaks to him. Ungud gives the medicine man his magical powers, which are symbolized in the kimba, or quartz crystals. The quartz crystals are believed to have had a celestial origin. Indeed, Ungud, the master and protector of the waters, being the Rainbow Ser- pent, also extends to the sky. From a certain point of view, one might say that Ungud represents the mythological expression of the effort to unite the opposites, to articulate the polarities in a single paradoxical unity. Let us add that the Rainbow Serpent58 is an important mytho- logical figure in many parts of Australia, and almost everywhere 53 Worms, op. cit., pp. 549-50. 54 Elkin, "Rock Paintings of North-West Australia," pp. 263; 269, n. 8. 55 Ibid., p. 276. 56 Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien, pp. 102-3. 57 It has been remarked that the figures of the Wondjina give the impression of a skull without jaws (cf. Adam, op. cit., p. 22, n. 44). The painted image may resemble a corpse, that is to say, the body of a Hero who transformed himself into a painting at the time of his death, while his spirit descended into a nearby Ungud pool, ready to act when his image is repainted (cf. Elkin, "Grey's Northern Kimberley Cave-Paintings Re-found," p. 12). The caves are often the place for the final disposal of the bones of those who are spiritually related to the nearby water pool (Elkin, "Rock-Paintings of North-West Australia," p. 278). 58 A. R.

Thus it appears that the Creation, the rain, fertility, and the supernatural powers of the medicine men are traced to one and the same source: a primordial Supreme Being of a cosmic structure; for Ungud belongs concomitantly to the subterranean waters, to earth, and to heaven. The Rainbow Serpent appears ab initio, at the very beginning of the world. The Wondjina completed the Creation; but their powers are derived from the Rainbow Serpent, just as the powers of the medicine man originate from him. We have here an exemplary primordial figure. The Rainbow Serpent can be compared with the Mesopotamian Tiamat and other ophidian Beings of the oriental cosmogonies. But such a comparison is only partially valid, for Ungud, the Rainbow Ser- pent, was never conquered and displaced by a younger divinity as Tiamat was conquered by Marduk. For the Ungarinyin there is perfect continuity between Ungud, the Wondjina, and the indi- viduals who, up to our own day, keep their world alive. Moreover, the medicine men continue to maintain direct personal relations with the Rainbow Serpent. REITERATING THE CREATIVITY OF THE DREAM TIME The religious actuality of Ungud and the Wondjina is demon- strated particularly by their powers as the source of rain and of fertility. In northern Kimberley, if a rock painting is touched by a man from the proper totemic clan, rain will fall and the spirit children will become available for incarnation. Likewise, repaint- ing the animal and vegetal images is said to increase the respective species. "In one part of Northern Kimberley the man who finds a spirit-child, must go to the gallery and touch up the painting of the rainbow-serpent, and even paint a representation of a spirit- child, so that the former will be able to keep up the supply."59 These spirit children are pre-existent; while unborn, they sojourn in well-defined sites. "The pre-existent spirits for the most part came into existence during the long-past dream time as a result of some activity of a hero; according to some beliefs, how- ever, they are made from time to time or brought into being by a creative hero whose activity was not confined to the past but is continuous."60 Among the Ungarinyin, Petri found only the belief that the spirit child is found by the father in a dream; cohabita- 59 Elkin, The Australian Aborigines, p. 201; cf. Oceania, I, 262. 60 Elkin, The Australian Aborigines, p. 198. 234</page><page sequence="28">tion is considered merely to be a pleasure.61 Similar conceptions are attested among many neighboring tribes of the Ungarinyin.62 And, as is well known, all over central Australia procreation is not directly associated with sexual intercourse.63 The "increase" of the animal and vegetal species by repainting the rock figures is not a magic act but a religious one.64 The men are reactivating their contact with the source of life. Thus the crea- tivity of the Dream Time is again reiterated on earth. The same principle informs the "increase ceremonies" (intichiuma or, to use the more general Aranda term, mbanbiuma) of the central Austral- ians, so abundantly described by Spencer and Gillen. The ceremon- ies are carried out at spots associated with the mythical history of the tribe: that is, the sites where the totemic Heroes performed the rituals for the first time. Each actor represents a mythical Ancestor; as a matter of fact, he reincarnates that Ancestor. Each ceremony lasts only a few minutes, and while it is being performed the audience chants a song narrating the mythical episode in process of re-enactment. At the conclusion of each ritual, the old men explain its meaning and the meaning of the decorations and sym- bols to the newly initiated youth.65 As T. G. H. Strehlow puts it, the chorus of old men "chant those verses of the traditional song which commemorate the original scene in the life of the ancestor which has been dramatized in the ceremony witnessed by them."66 Among the Karadjeri, notes Piddington, the increase ceremonies take place at specific centers, founded during the bugari ("dream") time, where the spirits of the species had been left in abundance. Sometimes the performers chant a song associated with the mythical origin of the community.67 Thus the increase of a natural species is brought about through a reactivation of the contact with the Dream Time Heroes, and such a reactivation can be brought about by refreshing the rock paintings (Wondjina), by re-enacting the original creative act, or by chanting the myth in which this episode is narrated. 61 Petri, Sterbende Welt in Nordwest-Australien, p. 163. 62 Ibid., p. 170. 63 Cf.
