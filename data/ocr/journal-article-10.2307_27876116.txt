<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENERAL CLAUSES, VIEWED FROM A DISTANCE By John P. Dawson Cambridge, Mass.* Of all countries whose law resides in comprehensive codes surely Ger many has had the fullest experience with law manufactured by judges under the auspices of general clauses. No outsider, especially one trained in American law, could hope to say anything that would be new to a Ger man reader concerning the great overlay of pure case law that has thus been superimposed on the codes. But it may be that the upheavals that produced it will present some different aspects when viewed by an out sider from a distance. This is more likely when the distance is great, as great as the distance supposedly is between the American and the German legal system, whose premises, sources and working methods have seemed to differ so totally over so long a time. During the last 20 years German lawyers have become familiar with general clauses of another kind, of a kind that for not much less than 200 years have been a pervasive presence in American law. I mean of course the basic guarantees of our constitutions: - "the freedom of the individual is inviolable," "all human beings are equal before the law," government shall not deny "life, liberty or property without due process of law." Such clauses are very general indeed though they certainly do not lack meaning. They state in condensed form and reaffirm some of the deepest aspirations of human nature, those aspirations that make us human. In their primary function, as restraints on the powers entrusted to government, they provide standards that ought to be understood and complied with by all who exer cise governmental powers. But the German legal system has decided as the American did long ago that organized courts provide essential leverage both in the effective exercise of publicly organized power and for testing its legitimacy. So the two societies are both committed now to a venture that other countries have rejected as too risky - placing primary reliance on the judiciary for the enforcement, the detailed application, the "concretiz ing" of these overriding, open-ended mandates. It seems that this relatively * The article is based on a talk delivered at the Law School of the University of Frankfurt a. M. on January 11, 1977. 29 RabelsZ Jg. 41 h. 3</page><page sequence="2">442 JOHN P. DAWSON RabelsZ recent venture should have major effects on attitudes in Germany toward the capacity of judges to serve as guardians on other frontiers. Our concern is now with private law and especially with the general clauses of the Civil Code, the famous three - 138, 242, 826. The central feature of all three is that they explicitly authorize the use of moral ideas - good faith and good morals - and that as phrased these ideas are com pletely disembodied. Even the broadest guarantees of the present German Constitution (guarantees of liberty, equality, dignity, and so on) provide immunities for human beings and encroachment on these immunities will usually occur in specific ways. But for the three most general clauses of the Civil Code there is no such living target. To insert in prominent places in a comprehensive code ideas that float at so high a level was to authorize voyages of discovery without destinations marked on any map. The three clauses could be described as roving search lights, supplied with beams that could penetrate anywhere in private law. It must have been evident from the outset that judges would play the leading role in managing this equip ment. For it would be primarily through conflict, resolved by processes of litigation, that vacancies or malformations in the landscape would be ex posed, so that judges would be the first to observe them. I should mention in passing a small flurry that we have recently had in the United States over a similar issue - a much more modest general clause that relates only to sales of goods. It is part of a more ambitious project, the Uniform Commercial Code, which is now in force in all but one (Louisiana) of the 50 states. The flurry has come over one provision (sec. 2-302) in Art. II, which as I have said covers only sales of goods. It provides that if a court shall find a contract of sale or any of its clauses to be "unconscionable," the court may "refuse to enforce" the contract or clause. Instead of offense to "good morals" or "good faith," the test becomes offense to "conscience." Voices have been raised in the United States to protest most vigorously against this attempt, by statute, to introduce "conscience" into the law of sales. The protesters, I believe, have forgotten 600 years of history. The Anglo-American legal system is divided down the middle by what used to be a gulf. The common law in England had been organized rapidly and, as it turned out, prematurely. For all its key controls were quickly captured by a group of legal technicians whose minds became locked within the system they created. The early English common law was the classic demonstration, if one were needed, of the disaster that will come to a legal order when its own rules and internal structure come to be viewed as com plete and self-sufficient, when it destroys its own capacity to respond to new needs and developing moral values in the society it serves. The revolt against the common law that followed was successful, for the highest polit ical authority, that of the English kings, was appealed to and the revolt</page><page sequence="3">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 443 was conducted by the leading royal minister, the Chancellor. But the ideas to which the Chancellors appealed to explain and justify their actions could not be stated more precisely than equity, fairness, and especially "good conscience." The appeal to such moral ideas was constant. Though in most of our states (all but four) common law and equity are now "fused" in the sense that they are administered by the same judges, these moral ideas are a living part of our tradition. I bring up these matters only to reveal a cast of mind. It is really a conviction, which I think all American trained lawyers would share - that the frontiers of law must continuously advance, often by appeal to moral ideas, and that on many fronts judges, by virtue of their function, are placed at vantage points, enabling them to perceive the directions that the advance will take. At times this means they should lead the way. Why, then should some American lawyers now protest at the inclusion of a general clause, with an explicit appeal to "conscience," in legislation that regulates broadly the law of sales? If our courts are free to express and be guided by moral ideas when the responsibility is theirs alone, does this mean that objection arises only when the same authority is conferred by statute? The question when phrased in this way seems silly but behind it lurks another that is not at all silly. The question is - where a legislature after full deliberation has enacted comprehensive legislation, how free should courts be to amend, extend or override duly enacted law? To such a question, in such general terms, there is of course no single answer. It may seem strange that a person trained in the United States should be con cerned about this at all, for we have gone as far as any country in entrust ing creative powers to judges. Most of our private law was originally judge-made. Large sectors are now governed by express legislation but other large sectors" remain in which whatever law we have originally was made and is still being made by judges, and the power to make includes power to amend, extend and override, since they are free to modify or overrule their own past decisions. But the reasons given by our courts are scrutinized most critically. In examining the reasons given for innovations we find that haunting questions constantly arise. How can courts acquire the information they need? In what way is their judgment superior in balancing out and appraising the interests that are in conflict, often multi sided conflict? How can they surmount the limitations that are built into the particular case when they must give reasons that project beyond - to situations that the judges know not much about and perhaps have not imagined? Questions like these, and others too, cause us anxious and con stant concern, even in areas where legislatures have chosen to abstain and have left law-making to judges. These questions are simply thrown into higher relief where the legislature has bestirred itself and has produced legislation that seems to apply. The 29*</page><page sequence="4">444 john p. dawson RabelsZ limitations and disabilities that are inherent in the judicial function should then move, I suggest, from the back to the front of the mind. The reasons why courts should hesitate are derived only indirectly from a constitutional principle of separation of powers, by which law-making is assigned to legislatures. For with judicial innovations that can properly be ascribed to a general clause, there is at least a formal answer to any formal charge of judicial usurpation. By including these clauses the draftsmen of the Code and legislature acknowledged both that the Code was incomplete and that it needed to be supplemented, primarily through judicial action, from sources outside the Code. The new formulas, the variations on old formulas, and new standards of value that the courts invented were then to be used as rules that would govern their own decisions. I have called this a purely formal answer. So far as it goes it is good enough. But it does not address the central questions as to when this peculiar form of law making power should be exercised and what its objectives and limits should be. Nor does it reverse or seriously modify the basic decision made in our two countries when their constitutions were adopted. This decision was that rules of law binding us all, the rules to which we owe allegiance, should be approved and validated by an agency of government that is responsive and responsible to the needs and desires of our people in ways that courts cannot be. It is true that legislatures too have deficiencies, of a different kind. The German Civil Code itself, as Professor Wieacker pointed out, was the product of a "ministerial bureaucracy," deeply imbued with Pandectist legal science1, and the process of screening and authentication by the legislature changed the basic text very little. Something similar could be said of our own recent experience with the Uniform Commercial Code, drafted by groups of expert legal specialists in close consultation with the commercial groups most affected. The legislatures of the 49 states that have adopted the Code have on the whole complied with the urgent entreaties that were made to them not to make changes in the standard text. But this com pliance did not mean that the text was not closely scrutinized and in fact many voices were heard by the 49 state legislatures before they approved their own versions. It may well be, as Professor K?hler has said, that the demands and pressures on our legislatures have reached such a degree as to foreclose their undertaking any largescale recasting or rewriting of private law, even though given much outside help. These demands and pressures also make them all too slow to respond to much more specific and immediate needs in law revision2. This has been our own experience also, even with our state legislatures, on which the demands and pressures 1 Wieacker, Privatrechtsgeschichte der Neuzeit2 (1967) 459. 2 K?hler, Kodifikation und Demokratie: JZ 1969, 645, 646-648.</page><page sequence="5">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 445 are enormously less than on a national legislature such as our federal Con gress or the Bundestag. These issues, as to where the initiative should lie as between courts and legislatures, are extremely troublesome. They continually recur in many different ways in all developed legal systems whose societies are committed to political democracy. At what point does the "creativity" of judges become callous adventurism? When do judges undermine their own authority and respect for their own function by arrogating too much power to them selves? This can happen anywhere across the far-reaching front of issues with which courts must deal. The general clauses, then, do not create these problems, they merely focus attention upon them. But I suggest that these clauses have also offered a special temptation. For in form they were, as I see them, express licenses to judges to go out hunting anywhere and bring back their trophies, to be hung then in the living room. More important, their search was described (as I think it almost had to be) as a pursuit of moral values, raised to a very high level and completely undefined. The temptation was for judges to delude themselves, to believe that by virtue of their office they had a private entrance to a carefully guarded sanctuary located in some higher place, in cloud land. On their return to a profane world they would retain the white robes that had to be worn during their frequent visits to the sanctuary and would also retain the zeal that one ex pects in missionaries wearing white robes. At this point I only raise the question whether the zeal and extreme self confidence shown by the Reichsgericht judges in their most spectacular adventure - in the inflation cases of the 1920's - was not due in part to their own deeply-felt conviction that they were left as the direct and only spokes men for the moral values of all Germans. On this I have only two com ments: (1) that such delusions, no matter how firmly they may be held, almost certainly serve to disguise personal prejudices and one-sided views of social policy at a much more mundane level, too mundane to be men tioned; and (2) that such abstractions, charged up with the emotion that the sense of mission generates, remove the incentives for close and careful reasoning and tend to block off thought. Our country has the best example to offer, the United States Supreme Court, which, during the nineteenth century, discovered the entrance into the sanctuary of natural law, was allowed to view the tablets in a private showing, and continued to wear the white robes for a long time thereafter, well into the present century. As to German courts I only venture the comment that since the 1920's their missionary zeal seems to have receded somewhat. To me it is more surprising that from the outset, under the Code of 1900, German courts found entirely congenial the role that they conceived to be assigned to them as guardians of the nation's conscience. This was possible, I suppose, because the role was at first conceived to be so very</page><page sequence="6">446 john p. dawson RabelsZ much more limited than it later proved to be. But the Reichsgericht moved in rapidly, seemingly without hesitation, to extend liability for intentional infliction of economic harm, finding violations of "good morals" (? 826) in wholly new kinds of injury inflicted in wholly new ways, through the acts or threats of large and powerful economic groups engaged in competition and conflict with each other. I have recently studied the long series of German court decisions on contracts that produce a Knebelung, which I have translated (inadequately) as "shackling." This is a concept that the Reichsgericht invented in a decision not quite five months after the Code took effect. As expressed in that case its essence was that "the moral ideas and perceptions of the people . . . cannot and will not permit that the superior power of capital should result in the enslavement (Knechtung) of the working capacities of another." Since nothing like this set of ideas appeared anywhere else in the Code they could only be brought to bear through resort to the other "good morals" clause (? 138)3. And very early a style of judicial writing developed, not only in condemnations of Knebe lung but over the whole range of issues to which general clauses were applied. I would call it a thundering style in which the transaction con demned was declared to "outrage the sense of decency of all fair- and right-thinking persons and offend the conscience of the people." With these and similar formulations the courts seemed to speak with righteous indig nation from a mountain top but with complete confidence that the stern moral judgments they expressed would be shared by the people down on the plain, for whom they were entitled to speak. The only feature that is surprising about this is that German courts should have felt so free to innovate, especially for such reasons, under a Code enacted so recently, prepared over decades with such scrupulous care, a Code to which their own allegiance seemingly was total. Their allegiance was not merely to the Code itself but to the ordered system of legal ideas that the Code expressed in short-hand, the broadly conceived and highly structured system created by Pandectist "legal science" - remark able for its internal consistency, clarity and precision. To true believers it must have seemed that all the important questions had been thought of or at least that answers could be readily found within the system. Such convictions would not have obstructed, indeed they must have strengthened, the close ties existing between high court judges and the governmental bureaucracy that took the lead in drafting the codes. Some judges were engaged in work on the Civil Code itself and the judiciary was much more heavily used in preparing the subordinate codes and accompanying legis lation4. The government they served had carried forward from Prussia a The discussion of Knebelung appears in Dawson, Unconscionable Coercion - The German Version: Harv. L. Rev. 89 (1975/76) 1041, 1071-1103. 4 Wieacker (supra note 1) 467.</page><page sequence="7">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 447 and other German states a tradition of strong authoritarian control. But among the advancing societies of the western world Germany had shown the greatest resistance to theories of economic individualism, whose gospel it was to minimize government functions. Whether cause or effect, this resistance corresponded with a continued, even increased responsibility as sumed by government for correcting the imbalances in German society and redressing social inequalities. Bismarck himself had taken a leading part in developing the working model of the authoritarian welfare state5. The question I ask relates to the period roughly two decades before and two decades after 1900, the effective date of the Code. My question (which I put most hesitantly) is whether a strong sense of identification with the governing leadership in Germany could have made the judges of that earlier time more confident and more ready to assume responsibility for discerning and promoting the general welfare, invoking for this purpose the moral authority conferred on them by the Code. However this may be, the motives of the German high court judges in their greatest adventure of all - their plunge into the jungle created by the inflation of the 1920's - were in this respect directly the opposite. Professor Kiibler has shown that many judges, even in the early 1900's, had become dissatisfied with the recognition and rewards they received and were also growing markedly conservative in their political views6. The estrangement became complete with the advent of a republican government under the Weimar Constitution, with the successive political and economic disasters that followed, bringing disorder and tragedy to German society that seemed to threaten its survival and that the government was more and more help less to remedy. The story has been often told of the judiciary's response, its claims to a "plenitude of power" at least equal to and perhaps overriding that of the legislature. The threats the judges made to the government were not in the end carried out, solutions were found, the whole period now seems in retrospect to have been a nightmare that daylight gradually dispelled. But the daylight proved to be only a twilight before a much deeper darkness descended. It is worth remembering that in that short interlude the German judiciary did what it could, and at that with con siderable success, to undermine the power of a democratic government to protect itself against implacable enemies that were determined to destroy it and very soon succeeded7. That is not at all to say the courts were not justified in intervening as they did to clear away the monumental debris left by the great inflation. 5 Dahrendorf y Society and Democracy in Germany (1967) 59 f. The phrase "authoritarian welfare state" is his. 6 K?hler y Der deutsche Richter und das demokratische Gesetz: AcP 162 (1963) 104, 109-111. 7 K?hler (supra note 6) 112-121.</page><page sequence="8">448 john p. dawson RabelsZ Nor do I see from my distant lookout point any better solutions for the manifold injustices that the inflation had produced. A high percentage called for highly individualized treatment, rather than the cutting blade of a strict statutory rule; so by common consent they were left for the courts to deal with. The performance of the courts in my own view deserves praise. It also seems to me that this was for modern German law the great turning point, what I have called the great shift of the main axis, by which leadership in law-making was transferred from the legislature to the courts, a shift that seems to me irreversible. The courts were confronted with an enormous variety of human situations, dislocations, aberrations that no one had imagined before. Their inventions matched in some degree the novelty of the issues that they had to resolve. But the formulas they invented could not be confined to inflation cases and have become a vast network, spread out widely and deeply over German private law. There seems to be no reason to be anything but cheerful about this, as modern German lawyers generally seem to be8. For there are so many clear paths and intersections in what would otherwise be a jungle - paths and intersections that the judges unaided could not have mapped out or maintained. This is a theme to which I will return. Whether the total result has been good or bad, whether it was inevitable or not, seems hardly worth discussing. But it is worth keeping in mind that this great shift began when high court judges were in a mood that verged on rebellion, when the judiciary claimed a "plenitude of powTer" that cannot be tolerated in a democratic society that is deter mined to govern itself. For I start from the premise that judges have highest credibility and contribute most when they perform the function that is assigned to them and that is peculiarly their own - the function of applying existing law in settling disputes. This function has strict limits but the limits bring great advantages. The highly regulated adversary procedures that prepare cases for decision compel intensive study of the elements unique to each dispute. The setting, the immediate surroundings, will be disclosed but there will be severe limits otherwise on the range of inquiry. The great advantage of this narrowing of horizons is that the particular problem becomes more manageable, so that if there are numerous interconnected problems they can be taken up one by one and not settled all at once. And it is an ex perience constantly renewed that open-ended, vague, overlapping or con flicting ideas fall into place, are seen in different perspectives and in more ordered relations with each other when brought to bear on the concrete 8 Not all, of course. One author who raised an outcry against judicial powers of free decision was Roth-Stielow, Die Auflehnung des Richters gegen das Gesetz (1963). But his polemic was not addressed at all to misuse of the general clauses and as to them he concluded reluctantly that they were necessary in order to prevent "gross unfairness" (41-45).</page><page sequence="9">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 449 facts of real-life conflict. But the importance of the function goes much beyond this. Courts are continuously engaged in re-examining the legal order in the way that is most searching of all - from below, at the innumer able points at which legal rules are to be applied. It is here that their mean ing and consequences are fully and effectively tested. It is here also that a crucial opportunity is given to preserve - even to create - order and co herence among the rules themselves as they are seen converging on the individual case. The reasoned judicial opinion as it has now been develop ed in some countries, and to a high degree in Germany, permits rationality to be achieved by segments. It is an indispensable base and take-off point for the continuous, unremitting effort in which many others also must be engaged, to preserve - or achieve - rationality in the legal order as a whole in the midst of constant change. I have suggested that the contribution judges can make will diminish in both credibility and usefulness as they move out and away from their primary function - which is deciding, and explaining why they decide, cases. In my own view this fade-out occurs still more rapidly when the justifica tion for the decision must depend at least in part on moral ideas existing independently of any legal rules. By this I mean that the moral ideas are made to appear not merely as supportive (to show that the legal order has managed to promote virtue after all) but as filling a gap, large or small, in the available legal rules. For I believe that judges are not endowed by their robes of office with superior insight into moral issues. More than this, it seems to me that for most moral questions of any importance or difficulty there are no answers that are self-evidently right, even to judges. Since the answers are and will remain contingent and debatable, any reasons given by judges that depend on them must be even more than usually tentative and revocable. For me it was therefore all the more astonishing that the Bundesgerichtshof not very long ago reported its discovery of a code of natural law that its judges had been privileged to examine. No other high court judges elsewhere, so far as I know, have reported such an experience for the last 50 years - the United States Supreme Court was the last to do so. So I conclude that the code of natural law is guarded in a space-vehicle that is permanently stationed over West Germany. The remarkable feature of this code is that of its own force it can strike down secular law - codes or statutes that legislatures have enacted - and can even create new crimes9. It does now seem that the vehemence with which the "plenitude" 9 It is scarcely necessary to assemble references to the voluminous literature on this topic. The discussions that I have found to be most persuasive are Evers, Zum unkritischen Naturrechtsbewu?tsein in der Rechtsprechung der Gegenwart: JZ 1961, 241; E. Stein, Die verfassungsrechtlichen Grenzen der Rechtsbildung durch die Rechtsprechung: NJW 1964, 1744; Wieacker, Rechtsprechung und Sittengesetz: JZ 1961, 337</page><page sequence="10">450 john p. dawson RabelsZ of judicial power was thus re-asserted has subsided somewhat. As a visitor from a distant place perhaps I am allowed to say, I hope so. As to the need for general clauses, who can doubt it? It is impossible to imagine what German law would have been if the draftsmen of the codes had not had the wisdom to provide, through open-ended language, many avenues for entry of new ideas, including new standards of value, and of these the most important surely have been the general clauses. Their ex plicit appeal to moral ideas and the influence that courts have ascribed to these ideas have added, I believe, to the moral authority of German law itself. Is this a retreat from the statement just made that in the realm of moral values judges do not have and should not claim superior insight? I think not. For one can readily concede that judges are at any rate human beings and that if they have no more, they have at least as much insight as others in the human race. But they also have a great advantage derived from the key position they hold, at the main intersection between the legal order and the human affairs that it regulates. For the close-up view of human events that the judicial function provides will include a high per centage of the instances in which one person protests that the legal order had worked or is about to work injustice. The one who files the protest will usually have an advocate on hand to define and "concretize" the claim of injustice and also to suggest some specific correctives that a court could employ. If the court is persuaded, a general clause will often give authority to apply these or other correctives. This way of defining the role of judges in applying high-level moral ideas expresses one of my own disabilities. This one is congenital. I am not a philosopher and could not be if I tried. I have never felt at home in the stately mansions that ethical philosophers have constructed, from Aristotle onward. But it also seems to me that the ideal values they describe are dis tant and will remain so, for they continually recede and escape our reach as we struggle to attain them. We have staked much on our hope that the struggle will continue, that among all the variables in human impulses these ideals will persist because they express deep and enduring needs in human nature. But there are too many variables in human nature and the ideals themselves take on different aspects when seen by different persons from their separate vantage points. If one thinks of the sense of justice, for ex ample, I believe that the sense of injustice is a much surer guide and wish that in discussions of the relations between morality and law this theme were more often examined. To me the inspiration behind the sense of in justice, the motive force it supplies, makes it something more than a matching counterpart of the abstraction, justice. For an offense against jus tice or other high moral standards is not likely to arouse a strong human</page><page sequence="11">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 451 response unless the offense occurs in some quite specific and describable way and unless it strikes at the root of deeply held conviction10. Perhaps there also enters here another of my own incurable handicaps, that I have been trained in American law. For as I have said, though we have by now in the United States a very large volume of legislation, the activities of our legislatures can still be described as selective. They have intervened for the most part in areas where there is some social interest to be protected or some social policy to be advanced, important enough to concern and activate them. It is true that when our courts are called on to interpret constitutional provisions they take great liberties and conceive their mission to be very broad. But if no constitutional issue were raised we would expect our courts to be most hesitant in modifying or overriding legislative decisions, in acting not extra but contra legem. Main attitudes, of course, must differ in a legal system that has been comprehensively codified, for then there will be few important and lasting innovations made by courts, through resort to a general clause, that will not be in some degree contra legem: contra legem in the sense that results called for by express language in some codes are modified or reversed for reasons that are not contained - do not even lie buried - in any code language except the "good faith" or "good morals" of the general clause itself. Attributing such innovations to "good morals", "good faith" or "con science," with citation to a general clause, provides, I have argued, only a partial and formal answer. For the mission of judges surely is not to lead ever onward and upward toward these receding goals, to select from the welter of impulses in human nature its highest aspirations and actively work to realize them. In a society whose main directions - whose policies, purposes and moral values - are not given to courts to determine, courts can still have a vital conserving function, ensuring that essential decencies, widely shared, are not violated. If German law in the last 50 years had run a less turbulent course the goals of German judges might have been less ambitious and they might have been somewhat less disposed to conceive of their role as that of architects and planners of a better moral order. Whether the role was conceived grandly, as it has been, or much more restrictively, there was bound to emerge much judge-made law. Much of "the judge's art" consists of the resourceful use of moral ideas that may be ascribed to a high-level source but provide standards for judgment at an intermediate level - one should not venire contra factum proprium (in American law "estoppel") or profit by one's own wrong, and so on. The sense of fairness responds to such admonitions and they guide analysis but their reach is too broad for them to be called rules of "law"11. Also, there 10 This theme was developed in a most interesting and persuasive way by Edmond Cakn, The Sense of Injustice, An Anthropomorphic View of Law (1949). 11 The importance and usefulness of such precepts, serving at a fairly high but</page><page sequence="12">452 john p. dawson RabelsZ may be situations whose elements combine in such peculiar ways that they seldom or never recur and the solutions reached are not drawn into con sequence. But many situations do regularly recur, there are very strong reasons of calculability and fairness (if only, that "like cases be treated alike") for continuities to develop. Many are solutions to practical problems of every-day life and, when they consistently recur, whatever moral ideas helped to give them warrant soon fade away; attributing them to "good morals" or "good faith" becomes not much more than a formal observance of courtesies. This process has long been routine and utterly familiar in a highly developed case-law system such as the German. I would not attempt, of course, even to summarize the vast areas of German law that have been transformed by these means. In general terms I will only say that the case-law thus developed is a vast repository of original ideas from which American lawyers have a great deal to learn. The directions taken by German and American courts are usually parallel but on some fronts you have gone well beyond us. I would like to pause for a moment on one topic to illustrate this, partly because I have lately found the results to be instructive for us. This is the standardized form contract containing Allgemeine Gesch?fts bedingungen. We too use such prefabricated forms and on a massive scale comparable to yours. As I have read the German sources, the treatment now given standardized form contracts was developed by court decisions with no basis whatever in the Code and with no significant aid from legislation until the comprehensive statute on the subject that became ef fective on April 1st, 1977. The result is to place standardized form con tracts in a separate enclave, next to but detached from the law of contract. It all began in a prosaic way, through the need for uniform rules of inter pretation for A.G.B, that were used uniformly in two or more districts with different Oberlandesgerichte, so that the Bundesgerichtshof concluded it must take on the interpreter's task. Then it came to be seen that most of the text on printed forms was not read and, if so, was seldom understood by the signers, that this made nonsense of the usual tests of mutual assent, that the draftsmen of such documents were in substance and effect law makers. So the conclusion took firm hold that there should be cast on them the responsibility of law-makers to distribute even-handed justice. Such forms are now subjected to severe scrutiny, and wide powers are used by the courts to strike out oppressive, unexpected, and one-sided clauses. This power was recently described by one distinguished German author as a notable achievement, which has made "worthy of confidence" the regime intermediate level as practical guides to just decision, has been particularly em phasized by Wieacker, Gesetz und Richterkunst (1958) 10-15 and Zur rechts theoretischen Pr?zisierung des ? 242 BGB (1956) 15-36.</page><page sequence="13">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 453 of free contract to which Germany is committed12. I mention all this be cause our courts also are all too keenly aware of the almost universal use of mass-produced form contracts, the absence of free, comprehending as sent by most signers, and the manifold abuses through one-sided draftsman ship. The only difference is that our courts have had only sporadic success in correcting the abuses. In our contract law standardized form contracts are our greatest problem, the one we are furthest from solving. The reason for this is, I think, that almost none of our courts have as yet dared to assume the Draconian powers that German courts have exercised for the last 20 years, seemingly with the utmost assurance that "good morals" and "good faith" were a sufficient warrant. Thus in this adventurous foray German courts are far ahead of ours but not too much should be made of this. As to standardized form contracts American courts will surely move in the same direction and some may eventually catch up. There are no doubt some patterns of decision by American courts that to Germans would seem to be advanced. What seems to me notable - I have said before elsewhere - is the increasing con vergence between Germany and the United States in the methods with which we administer our case law. It would be difficult to imagine two legal systems that differed so totally in their origins and that were separated for centuries by barriers that seemed so high, almost impenetrable. There are quite a few differences still. Our judges when they disagree publish their reasons for dissent. We borrowed this practice from England, as we did so much else, and have found it to be a very good thing. It adds much to the wealth and variety of useful legal ideas and to us does not seem to undermine but rather to increase confidence in the work judges do. An other difference is that we often show more disrespect for our judges and criticize them more severely. This does not mean much, for disrespect is an American trait. But all the methods of managing and appraising case law are as well known in Germany as in the United States - the distinction between obiter dicta and reasons that were "necessary," testing and limiting grounds for decision by imagining the effects of adding or subtracting particular facts, lining up cases in series, comparing and contrasting them, matching results against reasons given, all of this in a spirit of skepticism - let us say, with a suspension of belief. German legal scholars, many of whom in their other work have achieved the highest distinction, actively engage in examining case law in these test tubes and, more important, go on to co-ordinate, search out and define new directions, build new struc tures of order out of the newly created disorder and fit them all into the grand design. 12 Von Caemmerer, Ansprachen aus Anla? des 25j?hrigen Bestehens des Bun desgerichtshofes am 3. Oktober 1975 (1975) 21, 25-26. My own discussion of A.G.B, appears in the article cited above (supra note 3) 1103-1118.</page><page sequence="14">454 john p. dawson RabelsZ This seems to me the great achievement of modern German law. The grand design is of course based on and built around the Codes themselves but the Codes, especially the Civil Code, expressed, as I have said, in short hand the complex and integrated system of ideas that "legal science" had earlier constructed and on which consensus had been reached to a remark able degree. The triumph of the Pandectist system in nineteenth century Germany was due in part to its basic assumptions, which happened to be in harmony with and even helped to meet the dominant needs of the time. But the triumph was at least equally due to the precision, care and thor oughness with which the structure had been contrived. It was the culmina tion of centuries of work in Germany by learned and devoted men. One does not need to subscribe to theories of racial consciousness to conclude that the effects of an immense organized effort of this kind do not quickly wear away. There came many protests against "pandectology" at that time and later. The certainties concerning the prospects for human society that the nineteenth century presupposed have for the most part been destroyed. Conceptions of legal method and the relations between law and society have been almost completely recast. Despite all this, despite many changes and new directions in German law itself, despite the innumerable contro versies in an abundant literature, it seems to me from my great distance that certain habits of mind persist. One of them is the habit of searching for rationality and order and pursuing the search on and up through higher levels of generalization. This means climbing hill-tops quite often and try ing to map the plains below - not for the purpose of thundering down some dictate of the moral law (courts do that) but simply for the purpose of mapping, to secure an overview. There would be a good chance of being misunderstood if I were to say that the search for system continues. Any "system" of German law that one would now describe would be profoundly different from any that existed before, if only because of the great over burden of judge-made law that has since been laid upon it. It would be better to say that the struggle for coherence continues with undiminished force - coherence that is to be maintained and extended over wide sectors of the legal order. In this broader effort, almost inevitably, the academic profession continues to take the leading role. The major shift in the last 50 years has been the initiative taken by courts in the active making of law - the peculiar kind of law that courts can make. This has brought a change in the ancient partnership between German legal scholars and German courts: legal scholarship has receded from the front-line position that it formerly had to what amounts, much of the time, to a follow-up role. But receding in this way has by no means brought resignation from the partnership. The multifarious creations of German courts would have wandered aimlessly about in adjacent vacant spaces, if scholars had not made constant and strenuous efforts to connect</page><page sequence="15">41 (1977) THE GENERAL CLAUSES 455 them up, realign and rearrange and put them in place within the central edifice. And it seems unlikely that they would have succeeded so well if influence had not continued to work actively both ways. The influence is evident to any reader of German law reports, not only in the frequency with which the courts cite scholarly writings but in the extensive use the courts make of organizing ideas that were first proposed by scholars. I would go much further and say that predictability and coherence could not have been maintained in German law in such high degree if a close work ing partnership had not been maintained between a career judiciary and legal scholars, both highly trained in and firmly committed to the same highly ordered system of legal ideas. It was this conclusion that led me to make a suggestion recently to American readers. It was made in an effort to explain the boldness and wealth of judicial innovation in Germany in the last 50 years. It was coupled with a confession that we ourselves would have serious misgivings if American courts were to attempt so much. The suggestion is almost but not quite a paradox - that German judges have been so free because they accept so fully and have learned so well the systematics and disciplines of modern German law. The thought could be put in another way - that judges felt free to wander on the uncharted open sea because they knew their way home and intended to maintain a permanent residence there. There has been one other feature that has surely added to their confidence - they had expert guides they could trust, who watched their wanderings closely and who could tap them on the shoulder if they showed any signs of losing the way. The misgivings we might have if American courts were to wander so far - especially in the pursuit of high moral ideals - can be best explained by mentioning some aspects of your own good fortune. German legislation, almost all of it, applies uniformly nation-wide, the German judiciary com prises a career service with promotion from within, at the summit led by a high court whose jurisdiction also is nation-wide. Thus all judges can be forced - perhaps against the convictions of some - to speak with one voice and an expert critical literature can concentrate on one coherent body of legislation and decisional law. I need hardly remind that in each of our 50 states there is an independent legislature grinding out statutes, and only rarely is there a legislative model to which any will try to conform. There are 50 separate systems of courts, in no way bound by each other's de cisions, and they likewise speak with discordant voices. Most judges in these systems are elected by popular vote, though this is not true in the 51st, the overarching hierarchy of federal courts. Our legal literature can be described as extensive. I have read complaints about the volume of the German literature, that it has become un?bersehbar. Wait until you have 150 periodicals devoted exclusively to legal topics, plus perhaps 100 more</page><page sequence="16">456 john p. dawson RabelsZ that lawyers would do well to read, plus massive treatises and thousands of other books. The volume alone makes our legal literature "unoverlook able" indeed and insures that its quality will remain diffuse and uneven. I do not say these things in a spirit of complaint, for we have become accus tomed to this profusion and on the whole we enjoy our lot. I wish only to explain why German judges can be safely trusted with wider powers of innovation than we would think wise for our own courts. This is because when the floodtide of case law unexpectedly came, German courts and legal scholars proceeded to train each other in developing navigational skills and direction-finding devices that are superior to those found else where.</page></plain_text>
