<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aesthetic Effects of "King Pest" and "The Masque of the Red Death" Elvira Osipova Although different in a number of significant ways, especially in tone, "King Pest" and "The Masque of the Red Death" are united by the image of plague, and in both stories the repulsive and the ugly are aesthetically charged. While many readers may recoil from some of the more grotesque imagery, others find it fascinating, and it has influenced later generations of writers and artists. Scholars have embraced "The Masque of the Red Death," but appear to be puzzled by what to make of "King Pest," which certainly has had its share of detractors. Thomas O. Mabbott considered it "the least valuable" of Poe' s tales, ascribing its chief interest to the fact that it is "a forerunner of 'The Masque of the Red Death.'"1 This dismissive judgment seems undeserved, however, if we regard the tale in a wider context. Louis Renza gives an overview of various interpretations of "King Pest," which is mostly regarded as "a burlesque of the Gothic- Blackwood genre of writing."2 Presenting his critique, he argues that the "scatological vulgarity" of the images "would surely obstruct an audience's political, mythological, and even latter-day Oedipal translations," and he suggests, among other possibilities, a "neo-Marxist perspective" in interpreting the tale.3 Even without considering political interpretations, "King Pest" has inherently interesting aspects, such as the specific nature of the fantastic and the use of pictorial devices. The beginning of the tale, for example, is a veritable catalog of macabre details typical of Poe' s Gothic fiction: the kingdom of the plague; skeletons; decomposing corpses; decay; ruins; a morbid light; ghosts of Awe, Terror and Superstition stalking along deserted streets. The atmosphere is abruptly broken, however, when two drunken sailors unexpectedly find themselves in an undertaker's shop. From this point, in keeping with Poe's own dictates in regard to enticing readers, the "the ludicrous [is] heightened into the grotesque."4 To modern readers, the description of the company of six personages drinking ale in the undertaker's basement may bring to mind the surrealistic pictures of Salvador Dalí - e.g., "The Dream," "Combat," "Soft Construction with Boiled Beans," "Autumn Cannibalism," "Soft Self-Portrait with Fried Bacon," "Meditation on the Harp," "The Anthropomorphic Cabinet" - 25</page><page sequence="2">where the deformation of human flesh is as particularly striking as Poe' s descriptions. While depicting facial features, Dalí distorts lips, chins, and foreheads. In "The Dream," for example, the forehead overhangs the nose and reminds us of a low-placed cap; the protruding lips, eyebrows, and chin are pierced by thin and sharp objects. "Le sommeil (The Dream)" by Salvador Dalí © 2007 Salvador Dali, Gala-Salvador Dali Foundation/ Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York In several of his paintings, necks resemble towels resting on supports. Particularly disgusting is the representation of what should be human faces in "Autumn Cannibalism," where two partners are devouring each other. Other parts of the human body are also objects of experiment: feet and arms are exaggeratedly extended and dislocated, as in "Soft Construction with Boiled Beans." As another theme, Dalí emphasizes the dialectic of the soft and the hard, when fluidity gives way to mechanical deformations, as in "The Anthropomorphic Cabinet," where a torso is presented as a cabinet with drawers. 26</page><page sequence="3">Obviously, deformations of the human body and its organs, with impossible combinations of fantastic elements - although each of them appears quite real - were used as an artistic device long before the appearance of Surrealism. Still, Dali's experiments with form have something in common with those carried out by Poe in the 1830- 1840s, specifically in "King Pest."5 To see the connection, one needs to reconstruct the features of Poe's revelers. The president of the ghastly symposium has a forehead "so unusually and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh" (245). One of the two ladies has an unusual mouth, which commences at the right ear and is "swept with a terrific chasm to the left" (246). The other lady's nose "hung down far below her under lip" (247). The ears of one of "the 27 "Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)" by Salvador Dalí Courtesy of the Philadelphia Museum of Art: The Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection, 1950</page><page sequence="4">gentlemen" "towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment" (247-248); another man with "huge goggle eyes" is dressed in "a new, and handsome mahogany coffin" (248), and another man's prodigious cheeks "reposed on the shoulders of their owner" (247). This study describes ugliness in its most repellent and exaggerated forms. Of course, Poe's grotesque here is comic while the effect of Dali's pictures is anything but comic. In the age of psychoanalysis, Dalí presented images of paranoiac obsessions, delirious dreams, sensory hallucinations as symptoms of diseased psyche. What, then, could be the meaning of "King Pest," which bewilders an unsophisticated reader and makes scholars search for a hidden social meaning in such a macabre setting?6 Does the tale, indeed, contain an allegory, as its subtitle suggests, or is it just another hoax intended by an author who was fond of staging games for his readers? Do we regard the picture of ludicrous drunkenness as a didactic lesson against intemperance? It seems much more likely that Poe's aim consisted in drawing an artistic canvas with unusual and morbid images bound to produce a strong effect on the reader rather than having the story insinuate a "moral precept."7 Another story set during the plague is "The Masque of the Red Death." Here the rough humor and the burlesque design of "King Pest" give way to a more somber and sophisticated stylization. The decadent atmosphere of "The Masque" strongly reminds the reader of Aubrey Beardsley's pictures and the poetics of Wilde's "Salome" although devoid of its sensual tinge. Some editions of Poe's tales were, in fact, illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings by Aubrey Beardsley. His work often pictures a bizarre mixture of elements, writhing and fluid forms, decorativeness and stylization so characteristic of Art Nouveau and very much consonant with Poe's style in many of his tales. "The Masque of the Red Death" is set for another "feast during the plague," but in a different aesthetic environment. Instead of grimy slums, the setting is a castellated abbey isolated from the outside world. The décor of its fantastic chambers is similar in style to those in "The Assignation" and "Ligeia," but here the décor is even more elaborate and extravagant: "There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre , something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust" (673). Poe created theatrical settings and stage effects with the help of various devices, including light, color, sound, and a constant change of masks 28</page><page sequence="5">and costumes. The strange suite of chambers in "The Masque of the Red Death" winds sharply every twenty or thirty yards, so that it makes a spiral (one of Poe's favorite designs; see, for example, a sharply winding river in "The Landscape Garden"). These motifs are employed in many of Poe's tales, each time creating different artistic effects. David Reynolds saw a metaphorical meaning in the colorful and morbid scenes of the tale. The castle, in his view, is "analogous to Poe's private kingdom of art and fancy established in direct opposition to the bloody, uncontrolled sensationalism in his surrounding literary culture."8 Although the critic's analogy seems arbitrary, his underlying point is well taken. In opposition to the "mass literature," Poe worked out his own style, foreshadowing later experiments in art and "presurrealistic images." The characters in "The Masque of the Red Death," like the revelers in "King Pest," are "arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments." "Unsuited limbs" are brilliantly depicted in the earlier story, but what about "appointments?" Here the word used as a military term sounds ironic. (Incidentally, the Russian translations of R. Pomerantzeva and V. Rogov do not render this ironic meaning. In Rogov's variant the word "appointments" is translated as "decorations.") The story is short and dramatic. The figures representing dreams "writhed" and "stalked to and fro." Significantly, the verb "to stalk" has a negative connotation as it is used, for example, in "The Assignation." The jerking rhythm of the characters' movements is interrupted by moments of stillness when the figures freeze in unnatural positions, overwhelmed by awe and anticipation of an end. The end of the horrible masquerade in "The Masque of the Red Death" is arranged as a musical piece with the help of alliterations, anaphora, and a specific rhythm of the narration.9 Thus, both meanings of the word "masque" are realized - a masquerade and a theatrical performance. In its second meaning, a "masque" originally included dances and tableaux and later dialogues and songs. Frozen at the strokes of the ebony clock, the costumed figures make a visually impressive tableau that remains in the mind's eye long after the reading of the tale is done. Such visual and auditory effects have influenced many artists, among them Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, who, like Poe, challenged the conventions of their contemporaries and whose aestheticism was a reaction to naturalism. A similar trend appeared in Russia at about the same time. "Aestheticism manifested itself in Russian art at the start of the twentieth century, particularly in Art Nouveau with its spirit of contemplation, 29</page><page sequence="6">deliberate lack of ideology, and protest against tendentious art."10 Its most outstanding representatives in Russia were writers and artists who gathered round the magazine, "Mir Iskusstva" ("The World of Art"). In 1898 the Russian art critic (later, a world-famous ballet impresario) Sergey Diaghilev wrote about "a one-hundred-years war" which was waged in the nineteenth century between those whom he called "utilitarians" and the proponents of "art for art's sake."11 This perspective allows another vantage point to assess the significance of many of Poe's tales. Like their American predecessor, the Russian painters and critics of "Mir Iskusstva" group rejected a utilitarian approach to art. The "aestheticism" of "The Masque of the Red Death" becomes more obvious if we compare it with Alexander Pushkin's short drama, "A Feast During the Plague" (1830). The Russian poet translated a part of John Wilson's poem, "The City of the Plague" (1816), in which the scene is laid in London during the plague of 1665. (Pushkin knew the poem from its 1829 edition.) John Wilson, a poet and a critic, had prominently served on the editorial staff of "Blackwood's Magazine" for about twenty-five years when "The Masque of the Red Death" was published. It is reasonable to consider the possibility that Poe might have known Wilson's poem - he often referred to Wilson (who wrote under the pseudonym of Christopher North) in his critical reviews.12 Interestingly, "The City of the Plague" has not been mentioned by critics as a possible source of "The Masque of the Red Death."13 In Pushkin's translation, we feel the tragedy of a man who has lost his wife and mother during an epidemic of the plague. The drunken revelry of the characters is a way to dull their grief. The song of Walsingham, which is Pushkin's invention, may be translated in the following way: &lt;. . .&gt; Есть упоение в бою, There is mad joy in battle И бездны мрачной на краю, And on the verge of an abyss И в разъяренном океане, And in raS'nS ocean Средь грозных волн и бурной тьмы, Amidst the threatening waves И в аравийском урагане, and stormy darkness, И в дуновении Чумы. And in Arabia s sandstorm, And in the breathing of the Plague. Всё, всё, что гибелью грозит, Для сердца смертного таит А11 ЛаС is frauêht with death' Неизъяснимы наслажденья - For human heart Бессмертья, может быть, залог, Unspeakable enjoyments has - И счастлив тот, кто средь волненья Perchance, a pledge of immortality, т* Их ^ . And happy is he, who, amidst this chaos, т* Их обретать и ведать мог ^ &lt;. . .&gt; . ^ , Could ^ feel these , joys.14 30</page><page sequence="7">Pushkin wrote his drama (one of his so-called "Little Tragedies") in the village of Boldino during an epidemic of cholera which, in Pushkin's times, was justifiably considered a kind of plague. These circumstances added poignancy to his text. The comparison of these three "feasts during a plague" suggests that Poe's stories of plague, most importantly, project visual and aesthetic dimensions that outlast and overwhelm possible moral or political readings. Unlike Pushkin who described a human tragedy - revelry in the face of horror, despair and annihilation - Poe pursued a different aim. His tales set during the time of the plague do not project grief, but strong visual and aesthetic effects. Clearly, these effects have had tremendous influence on many painters and poets who follow Poe. 31</page><page sequence="8">32 Notes 1. Edgar Allan Poe, Tales and Sketches. Vol. I, ed.

See, for example, Alexander Nikolyukin, American Romantic Prose (Raduga Publishers: Moscow, 1984), 26-27. Nikolyukin assumes that the tale contains a satire on President Jackson and his cabinet. Hints to this effect can be found in Louis Renza's article as well. 7. Poe's strictures against moralizing are well known. Very often the butt of his attacks is directed at Emerson and his circle. To give but two examples: at the beginning of "The Imp of the Perverse," he took to task "moralizers" (as well as phrenologists) who dared to "dictate purposes to God" (1219); in another "tale with a moral," "Never Bet the Devil Your Head," Poe jokingly accuses both writers and critics (including the contributors to the "Dial") of implying a moral or insisting on its necessity in a work of art. "Every fiction should have a moral; and what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fiction has " (621). 8.

Pomerantzeva; the anaphora conjunction "and" repeated five times by Poe in the story is lost; instead, five short sentences are joined to make three long ones.
