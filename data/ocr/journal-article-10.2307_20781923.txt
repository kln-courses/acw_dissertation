INTRODUCTION For the scholar, an easement is a kind of servitude, or maybe a servitude is like an easement.1 Grouping easements with covenants and equitable restrictions in an attempt to "unify the law of servitudes"2 is like putting bamboo poles into plastic garbage sacks: if the fabric doesn't tear (and let everything fall out), the resulting package is too unwieldy to carry. 1 For easements as servitudes, see, e.g., Reichman, Toward a Unified Concept of Servitudes, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1177, 1187(1982). For servitudes as a kind of easement, see, e.g., C. Clark, Real Cove nants and Other Interests Which "Run With Land," 174-75 (2d ed. 1947) [hereinafter Clark, Cove nants]. 2See, e.g., Reichman, supra note 1; and French, Toward a Modern Law of Servitudes: Reducing the Ancient Strands, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1261 (1982). More daring integrations have been suggested. Korngold, For Unifying Servitudes and Defeasible Fees: Property Laws Functional Equivalents, 66 Tex. L. Rev. 533 (1988). See text accompanying notes 14-22. Professor Susan French argues for fairly radical unification in two more recent articles: French, Design Proposal for the New Restatement of Property, Servitudes, 21 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1213(1988), and Servitudes Reform and the New Restate ment of Property: Creation Doctrines and Structural Simplification, 73 Cornell L. Rev. 928 (1988). Neither article advocates the complete elimination or submersion of easements, and the second leaves affirmative easements at least as a category.</page><page sequence="3">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 105 For the judge, an easement is an uncomfortable reminder of law school days.3 Easements may involve the application of apparently absurd fictions,4 or a rule that uses the term "reasonable" so often that it becomes a tongue twister.5 For the student, the problems of scholar and judge merge. Students find easements confusing; they are not possessory like fees and can come from many sources. Easements are almost, but not quite, as confusing as estates and future interests. Covenants may run, and easements can be thought of as running; the concepts run together, and the distinctions blur. Students cannot remember if easements require privity or create it.6 For the parties and lawyers trying to resolve a dispute about the use of an easement, the easement is truly a nuisance. It involves the efforts of different owners, each wanting to make reasonable uses of their interests in land. This article examines the existing arrangement for resolving the questions of conflicting uses of easements. The present arrangements are evaluated under a variety of tests. Finally, the article suggests a new and simplified arrangement based on the similarity of this problem to a nuisance dispute and using the method of resolving these disputes as a model.7 A. What Is an Easement? The Restatement of Property has a good definition of an easement: An easement is an interest in land in the possession of another which: (a) entitles the owner of such interest to a limited use or enjoyment of the land in which the interest exists; 3Cushman v. Davis, 80 Cal. App. 3d 731, 145 Cal. Rptr. 791 (1978). 4A court that measures the scope of an easement by the original grantor's and grantee's contemplation may have to imagine that parties in the 1790s realized that some day automobiles would be invented. 5A grant in general terms of an easement of way will ordinarily be construed as creating a general right of way capable of use in connection with the dominant tenement for all reasonable pur poses, and where this is the case, the only restrictions on the mode of use is that it shall not interfere unreasonably with the rights of the owner of the servient estate, and must be such as is reasonably necessary and convenient for the purpose for which the easement was created, or, in the absence of its creations for any specific purpose, to further any legitimate and useful purpose to which the dominant tenement may naKirally and reasonably be devoted, even though differ ent from that to which such tenement was devoted at the time the easement was granted. H. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property, ? 803, at 322-23 (3d ed. 1939) (footnotes omitted; emphasis added). 6Carlson v. Libby, 137 Conn. 362, 77 A.2d 332 (1950) (easements create privity of estate allow ing covenant to run). On a recent exam some students persistently discussed "touch or concern" in an easement problem. 7This article suggests that the position of the Restatement (Second) of Property (Servitudes) (Tent. Draft No. 1,1989) [hereinafter Proposed Restatement?Servitudes], which assimilates easements into a more general category of servitudes, is not a good idea because easements are a special kind of interest. Although there is no real objection to the treatment of most negative easements as covenants, the special problems of creation and scope of easements merits separate treatment. It is doubtful that many states will adopt the Restatements position on a matter of property law that is essentially paro chial and where there is no significant impulse for uniformity and unification. Consider that, for in stance, the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act has been adopted in only 11 states over a 43-year period and the Uniform Land Transactions Act has been adopted nowhere in 15 years, while the Uniform Commercial Code has achieved true uniformity.</page><page sequence="4">106 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 (b) entitles him to protection as against third persons from interference in such use or enjoyment; (c) is not subject to the will of the possessor of the land; (d) is not a normal incident of the possession of any land possessed by the owner of the interest; and (e) is capable of creation by conveyance.8 A popular real estate book for college students provides an even simpler defini tion: An easement is a right to use the realty of another for a special or designated purpose. An easement is a real property right, but it is not regarded as an estate in real property.9 Nonlawyers have no trouble with the most common types of easements, ways and utility easements. The basic idea of an easement as the use of someone else's property is not difficult to grasp. The language of easements is metaphorical or anthropomorphic. The real property is personified and referred to as if the land itself owns the use and the land's rights, not its owner's, are reduced.10 The domi nant estate uses the easement for its advantage; the servient estate is obligated to stand by and allow the use.11 Because an easement is a privilege to make a use of another's land, there are problems at the margins of the concept. At one end, easements fade off into mere licenses;12 at the other end, they become a possessory estate rather than a simple use interest.13 Most easement problems concern the creation or the scope of the easement. Easements, both the idea and the word, were known to the medieval com mon law, but an easement was only one of a variety of incorporeal heredita ments.14 In the early 19th century, easements began to develop both in impor tance and as a systematized and defined branch of the law. Gale on Easements appeared in 1839 and became the starting point for modern law. The need for easements of various types, both affirmative, or positive, and negative, began with the Industrial Revolution. Ways were required to allow passage onto new roads. Increased development provided the impetus for the creation of ease Restatement of Property ? 450 (1944). 9J. Dasso, A. Ring &amp; D. McFall, Fundamentals of Real Estate 110 (1977). 10O. Holmes, The Common Law 382-86 (1881 ). This article assumes familiarity with the terminol ogy of easements. Thus, the terms "appurtenant," "in gross," "dominant," and "servient" will not be defined. "Grantor" will be used to describe the person who owns a servient parcel and "grantee" will be used to describe the owner of a dominant parcel at the time the easement is created. Thus, there may be a grantor and grantee when there is no grant, not even a fictional one. For instance, if an appurtenant easement is created by prescription, the owner of the dominant land is the grantee of the easement and the owner of the servient land is the grantor. 11For a set of definitions, see Restatement of Property ?? 451-56 (1944). 12Jabour v. Toppino, 293 So. 2d 123 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1974). Licenses are revocable and usually not protected against third party interference. Restatement of Property ?? 520-21 (1944). uCompare Swan v. O'Leary, 37 Wash. 2d 533, 225 P.2d 199 (1950) (easement) with Carr v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 23 Wash. App. 386, 597 P.2d 409 (1979) (defeasible fee). 143 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 153-57 (5d ed. 1973).</page><page sequence="5">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 107 ments for light and water courses.15 Although the law of covenants and equitable servitudes developed contemporaneously, for purposes of this analysis the differ ences between them are more important than their similarities. Recently, some authors have suggested the need to unify, simplify, and ra tionalize the law of servitudes. The term "servitude" includes easements, real covenants, and equitable restrictions. Generally, the recommendation is to elimi nate technicalities that differentiate equitable restrictions (servitudes) from cove nants, simplify the process of creation by merging the various methods and theo ries of creation, and retain certain systems for removing outmoded servitudes.16 Most of these discussions mention easements as a type of servitude but deal largely, if not exclusively, with negative easements. Negative easements are al most always a device to control land use.17 But easements, taken as a whole, can not easily be fitted within the simplified servitude structure. There are a number of reasons for this. As Professor Lawrence Berger has pointed out, easements are created in a variety of ways that other servitudes are not. The creation of implied easements differs greatly from that of implied servitudes; almost no other servi tude can be created by prescription.18 In addition, affirmative easements involve a dual use of land.19 Because both owners are using the servient land, there is more need for interaction and cooperation between the dominant and servient owners. A covenant usually requires the servient owner simply to act or to refrain from acting. There is little need for any continuing give and take in working out problems. Easements tend, more often than servitudes, to be bilateral relation ships or to involve only a small group.20 Easements have more dimensions than covenants. There is seldom any discussion about the scope or extent of a cove nant or servitude.21 157 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 321-42 (2d ed. 1973). 16See supra notes 2 and 7. 17Common law recognized negative easements of light and air. Conard, Easement Novelties, 30 Calif. L. Rev. 125,126 (1942). Certain cases defined building restrictions as negative easements. See, e.g., Trustees of Columbia College v. Lynch, 70 N.Y. 440 (1877). Today negative easements may be important for preserving alternate energy sources (e.g., solar and wind easements) as well as more general restrictions such as conservation easements. 18Berger, Unification of the Law of Servitudes, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1339,1340 (1982). Berger, Inte gration of the Law of Easements, Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes, 43 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 337, 351 (1986). 19Clearly the dominant owner has the use(s) allowed by the easement. The servient owner has all the uses any land owner has, subject to the superior right of the dominant owner. The servient owner may use the land in any way that does not interfere unreasonably with the easement. City of Pasadena v. California-Michigan Land &amp; Water Co., 17 Cal. 2d 576, 110 P.2d 983 (1941). With affirmative easements, the effect of the easement in limiting uses of an estate is incidental to the main purpose of the easement. With restrictive servitudes, it is the whole point of the arrangement. 20lf the streets in a subdivision are not dedicated to the public use, they are easements appurte nant to each lot in the subdivision. If property lines run to the middle of streets, most, if notali, lots are also servient estates. 2'Servitudes are usually bipolar: either you act or you do not. Change may terminate the servi tude, but it does not usually cause changes in scope. In a lease and in some planned development cases, the entire arrangement and any particular agreement may be more complex and sometimes a</page><page sequence="6">108 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 While easements are clearly treated by the courts as property interests pro tected by the laws of property, servitudes are sometimes treated as a special type of contract. There seems to be some reluctance to afford them the full status of a property interest.22 Easements and servitudes are treated differently when changes of conditions are argued to justify their termination.23 For these reasons it seems there is no particularly good justification to impress easements into a simplified law of servitudes. Simplifying covenants is a grand idea, but easements deserve their own niche.24 Unfortunately, easements qua ease ments have received little scrutiny and the utility of old doctrines has not been re examined and challenged by new ideas designed to meet modern day needs.25 An affirmative easement is a privilege to use the land of another person. An easement, as such, clearly has no value apart from the use it allows. An easement appurtenant adds value to the dominant estate but only to the extent of the use allowed on the servient estate. Deny the use and the easement is denied; limit the use and the value of the easement is limited. Thus, aside from creation problems, the most important issue with respect to an easement is the scope of its use. B. The Problem Stanley owns a farm in an increasingly urbanized area. Some nearby owners have converted their farms to residential or commercial use. The local highway will soon increase to four lanes. Donna, Stanley's neighbor to the rear, has a farm about the same size as Stanley's. Donna has access by a winding, often muddy county road and by an easement across Stanley's land directly to the highway. The easement currently is a gravelled road about a vehicle-and-a-half wide. provision might have something like scope problems. But usually scope disagreements are not gener ated by changes or developments. Change often means termination of covenants or restrictions. Be cause of the clarity in most subdivision documents, scope issues are unlikely to arise. 22Compare the treatment of servitudes and easements under eminent domain laws. See, e.g., Arkansas State Highway Comm'n v. McNeill, 238 Ark. 244, 381 S.W.2d 425 (1964). 23Compare Waldrop v. Town of Brevard, 233 N.C. 26,62 S.E.2d 512(1950) (while changed condi tions may justify nonenforcement of restrictive covenants, easements not affected) with Downs v. Krueger, 200 Cal. 743, 254 P. 1101 (1927) ("covenant" terminated on basis of changed conditions). 24See supra note 7. 25ln the journals, except for discussions much narrower than this, no one has done much with easements since Alfred Conard's series of articles in the early 1940s. See Conard, An Analysis of Li censes in Land, 42 Colum. L Rev. 809 (1942); Requirement of Sealed Instrument for Conveying Ease ments, 26 Iowa L. Rev. 41 (1940); The Privilege Forcibly Ejecting an Amusement Park, 90 U. Pa. L. Rev. 809 (1942); Unwritten Agreements for the Use of Land, 14 Rocky Mtn. L. Rev. 153(1942); and Easement Novelties, 30 Calif. L. Rev. 125(1942). J. Bruce &amp; J. Ely, The Law of Easements (1988), ended what the authors saw as a near century of scholarly neglect. Id. at v. Their promise of a comprehensive exposition and analysis is generally achieved. The full range of easement topics is dealt with, and the variety of state approaches to each is recognized. But in a text of less than 500 pages covering all of easements and licenses, full consideration of "competing policy considerations" necessarily fails, notwithstanding the authors' hope. J. Backman &amp; D. Thomas, A Practical Guide to Disputes Between Adjoining Landowners?Easements (1989) (reviewed in this issue at page 213), has even broader sub ject matter coverage. Less than 400 of its pages deal with easements, covenants, licenses, and party walls. It also deals with boundaries, adverse possession, support rights, and mineral and water prob lems. Both texts seem to be intended for the practitioner with a need to solve a particular problem.</page><page sequence="7">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 109 Donna plans to convert her farm to a residential subdivision or sell to a resi dential developer. There is considerable advantage to using the easement rather than the county road to reach the highway. Stanley is not sure how he feels about the changes in the area. Donna has approached him and said that the easement must be widened and paved to ac commodate the additional traffic that will be produced by the development. Assuming that Donna does in fact have an easement, what are her rights with respect to the widening, paving, and increased use of the road? C. Scope of Easements When a dominant owner (Donna) wishes to make changes in the use of the easement to which the servient owner (Stanley) objects, the court's decision is framed in terms of the scope of the easement.26 "Scope" is shorthand for the rights of the dominant owner. Scope has a number of dimensions: 1. Geographical How much of the land is covered by, for instance, a parking easement?27 How wide is an easement of way?28 2. Mode In what manner may the dominant owner use the easement? Is an easement labeled a "cartway" limited so as to exclude automobiles?29 Does an easement for electric power permit the transmission of cable television signals?30 3. Purpose Can an easement established to reach a pasture be used to reach a nudist resort built in the pasture?31 4. Intensity How much more traffic can an easement of way carry?32 Can a larger pipeline be installed to carry more fuel?33 Can an additional pipeline be added?34 26This article deals with scope issues generated by changes made to the dominant estate. Scope issues may also arise when conduct by the servient owner, either based on changed uses or other wise, threatens interference with present or potential uses of the easement. The basic determination of scope is made in the same way as with dominant owner changes. The usual remedies may also be used. The proposed solution of a "buy-down" by servient owners is discussed in the text accompany ing notes 164-68. Sometimes injunctions may be denied but damages awarded to the dominant owner when a servient owner has interfered in good faith. See, e.g., Griffin v. Red Run Lodge, Inc., 610 F.2d 1198, 1204 (4th Cir. 1979). 27AC Assocs. v. First Nat'l Bank of Fla., 453 So. 2d 1121 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984). 28Cushman Virginia Corp. v.

Physical Effect Can the easement of way that was a gravel road be paved?35 Can a ditch be replaced by an underground pipe?36 6. Duration How long does the easement last? Does the easement end when a building it served is torn down?37 Does an easement by necessity end with access?38 7. Impact This is a summary, or result, of the dimensions. How much more can the servient owner's use be limited? Can an easement's change be allowed to affect the "rural charm" of the area?39 Donna's questions basically concern size, purpose, intensity, physical effect, and impact. Duration is unlikely to be at issue in our case. Donna wants to know whether her new use will be permitted. When a dominant owner proposes to expand or change her use, some au thorities take the position that the original scope of the easement should be deter mined. For them, all easements have some room for reasonable change, but some easements (such as prescriptive easements) start with a more limited scope and thus less change is permitted.40 Other authorities seem to suggest a range of expansion, smallest for prescriptive easements, slightly larger for implied, and largest for written.41 The issue is how much change or expansion the particular type of easement takes. The first group of authorities speaks of a scope issue, the second group speaks of an expansion issue. Regardless of how the discussion is framed, each is deciding whether a change (or expansion) is permitted. The ques tion will be referred to as the change/expansion problem. For present purposes, assume that the dominant owner is motivated by a de sire to make what she perceives to be a more productive use of the land. This desire is usually the result of changes to the area that evoke changes in the domi nant estate or technological developments or discoveries peculiar to the domi nant estate. A rural area changes to a commercial or residential area in the course of normal development. Transportation methods shift from horse-drawn wagons to cars and trucks. New farming techniques require more frequent trips to fertilize and apply herbicides. Minerals are discovered on the dominant estate, or known 35See Gui'llet v. Livernoi, 297 Mass. 337,8 N.E.2d 921 (1937) (holding one entitled to use private right of way may make reasonable repairs and improvements when way is already in use and espe cially where way is impassable without improvements). 36Restatement of Property ? 478 comment d (1944). 37R.

These changes in use, resulting from new events, will be referred to as "development driven."42 The servient owner's reasons for resisting a change/expansion are usually irrelevant. If the change/ex pansion is within the permissible scope of the easement, it will be allowed.43 D. Analytical Considerations Regarding Creation of Easements Often courts may be faced with the question of whether an easement exists. Even if it does, the type or source of the easement must be determined. Is the easement created by a writing, by implication, by prescription, by necessity, or by estoppel? Is it appurtenant or in gross?44 All of these generally are asked and 42The courts' frequent statements that expansion of use reflects reasonable use of property and that change of use caused by normal development is permissible suggest that development driven changes are usually allowed. There appears to be a general trend toward allowing, if not fostering, development and growth. However, the nebulous quality of the standards applied in the cases allows ad hoc adjustments in particular situations. 43The courts do not usually focus on the servient owner's reasons for resisting the change. The following are a few reasons why the servient owner may oppose the change/expansion: 1. The servient owner is really concerned about the impact that change/expansion of the use will have on the servient land. 2. The servient owner is concerned about the effect that the new use of the dominant land, not the change/expansion, will have on the servient land. This effect can be called the "nuisance effect." This does not imply that the use is a nuisance; it connotes that the effect results from the use of the dominant property, not the use of the easement. Whether it is, in actuality, a nuisance would be left to that area of the law. My point is to separate that effect from the easement effect, the impact of the change/expansion of the easement's use. One way to see if there is a nuisance effect is to look to the impact of any changes on nearby non-servient land. To the extent that the effect on servient land is the same, it is a nuisance effect. 3. The servient owner is trying to extract the maximum profit from the situation. Whether the servient land is affected, the servient owner is seeking to maximize his return. A ser vient owner might be encouraged by other nearby owners to resist change because they do not want the new use of the dominant tenement and perceive that it will lower the value of their land. If the change/expansion can be thwarted this way, it may be easier, cheaper, and more successful than a nuisance suit. 4. The servient owner is motivated by spite; there is rancor between the servient owner and the dominant owner. 44Courts typically do not favor easements in gross. Martin v. Music, 254 S.W.2d 701 (Ky. Ct. App. 1953). This may be because at one time easements in gross were said not to exist. Loch Sheldrake Assocs. v. Evans, 306 N.Y. 297,118 N.E.2d 444 (1954). More likely it is because an easement in gross detracts from the use or value of one parcel without any advantage to the use or value of another parcel. An easement appurtenant is a detriment to the servient land but also confers an advantage to the dominant land. "Benefit" and "burden" are not being used because they are technical, legal con cepts rather than factual effects. To say that an easement benefits certain land means legally that the easement is appurtenant to that land. The benefit is the extra rights the dominant owner has in the servient land. This legal benefit is an advantage to the dominant owner. That an easement gives an advantage to the owner of a particular parcel of land may help lead to the conclusion that the ease ment is appurtenant to or benefits that land. The burden is the reciprocal of the benefit: it is the extent to which the rights of the servient owner are decreased by the easement. This, of course, has a factual impact, the detriment to the servient land. Courts sometimes seem to use the legal term "burden"</page><page sequence="10">112 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 answered before continuing to the scope issue. When the court turns to scope questions, it may frame the issue as to original scope or as to expansion. In exam ining court decisions, three considerations appear in all discussions and affect how questions are both asked and answered. 1. Expectations/Intentions This consideration applies to both written and unwritten easements and fo cuses on the expectations of the parties to the original transaction or their succes sors. If the easement is written, the language will be examined. The original par ties know what they meant; readers' expectations are based on that language. Even unwritten easements may create expectations. Though the expectations created by unwritten easements may be less certain (because there is no text on which one can say they should be based), they may exist.45 2. Use/Value This consideration recognizes that the value of a property interest lies in the owner's ability to use that interest as desired. Use and value considerations lie behind the doctrine of constructive eviction for tenants who may possess but can not use the leasehold. Nuisance law involves the recognition and working out of the conflicting use interests of neighbors. In easement cases, this consideration justifies the general principle that both the dominant and servient owners should have some chance to use their interests and to gain whatever value that use will give. Unlike many property interests, an easement has value only as a use (be cause that is all it is). Courts often use a rule of reason when balancing the owners' interests.46 3. Compensation/Consideration This principle involves the notion that, in general, penalties should be com mensurate with fault and benefits should be paid for by the recipient. It finds rec ognition in the doctrines of nonforfeiture and redemption in a number of prop erty areas, and in quasi-contractual remedies.47 At least one court has suggested when they are talking about the factual impact or detriment. (See infra text accompanying note 76.) The discussion of promises respecting the use of land in the Restatement of Property ? 537 (1944) suggests the validity of this detriment/advantage rationale. In addition, the easement appurtenant is a limited easement. It cannot be extended to non-dominant land. Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash. 2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986). Where a right to use is self-limiting, it may be more likely to be read as in gross in a doubtful case. See Loch Sheldrake Assocs., 306 N.Y. 297, 118 N.E.2d 444. This rule, of course, leaves two questions: (1) which land is the dominant land and (2) how do you tell if an easement is "serving" dominant or non-dominant land? 45See infra text accompanying note 69. 46Sakansky v. Wein, 86 .H. 337, 169 A. 1 (1933). 47Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. v. Taylor, 318 So. 2d 203 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975) (trial court's reinstatement of a mortgage and dismissal of foreclosure action affirmed because default was technical and loss of entire property would result).</page><page sequence="11">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 113 that application of this principle to the law of prescription is generally appropri ate.48 These three considerations make themselves felt with varying weight in the courts' resolutions of change/expansion problems. They account for the ques tions that the courts ask in determining the scope or expansibility of the types of easements and the hierarchy of scope or expansion from written to implied to prescriptive easements. E. Doctrines Concerning the Creation of Easements A brief description of the doctrines concerning the creation and scope of easements will demonstrate how these considerations have shaped the current arrangements for dealing with the change/expansion problem. 1. Written Easements Little need be said about the creation of easements by a writing. If the only easements were those created by writing, there would be far fewer problems.49 Because easements are universally regarded as property interests, they can (and in fact should) be created by a writing complying with the Statute of Frauds.50 A written easement can be assumed to represent the intention of the parties to the transaction. The easement is either a conscious gift by the grantor or was an ele ment in any exchange that accompanied the transaction. The writing can be re corded to give future takers of the servient parcel notice of the easement and is a reference for anyone who acquires the easement. In determining the scope of an easement, a court seeks certainty and first ex amines the writing. If the language addresses the problem directly, the court ap plies the language of the easement.51 In some circumstances, the court applies general rules of interpretation to the easement in an attempt to discover the meaning that the parties attached to the language of the grant or reservation.52 This is a search for a precise meaning, again a search for certainty. If the search for certainty fails, either because the interpretation of the writing yields no answer or because the easement was not created by a writing,53 the court resorts to easement-specific methods to determine scope. With written un 48Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc., 139 Cal. App. 3d 260, 188 Cal. Rptr. 563 (1983), vacated, 35 Cal. 3d 564,199 Cal. Rptr. 773, 676 P.2d 584 (1984). The opinion is fully reported only in 188 Cal. Rptr. 563. 49But such limitation is improbable because of settled decisions and also may not be wise. There are good and valid reasons for continuing the creation of easements by implication, prescription, and necessity. 5ee Sterk, Neighbors in American Land Law, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 55 (1987); Singer, The Reliance Interest in Property, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 611, 665-72 (1988). 50The easement may be granted by itself, granted with a possessory interest, or reserved when a possessory interest is granted. There is some problem with easements "reserved" for third parties serving land not retained by the grantor. The trend, though still a minority, is to allow such a reserva tion. Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 8.3. 51W. Burby, Handbook of the Law of Real Property, ? 32 (3d ed. 1965). 522 American Law of Property ? 8.66 (A. Casner ed. 1952). 53lf an invalid written easement is involved, and is validated by either prescription or estoppel, it would probably be treated as a written easement.</page><page sequence="12">114 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 certain easements, these methods may involve speculation as to the original par ties' contemplation or intention,54 or a statement that the use will be a reasonable one.55 When courts search for certainty and look for a definite answer in a written easement, the chief value served is expectation/intention. If the easement is clear, parties or successors can be expected to have made appropriate adjustments in terms of consideration for any loss or gain in value. There is no unfairness in tell ing the landowner to leave land vacant when the easement explicitly grants a parking easement over the entire parcel.56 The grantor of the easement, or pur chaser of servient land, is not being penalized; he could have adjusted his price or been otherwise compensated. The easement clearly precludes any surface use by the servient owner. Thus, there is nothing to balance against the dominant owner's claims for use. Some courts, dealing with an uncertain written easement, qualify the intention-seeking inquiry by suggesting that the parties are presumed to have in tended reasonable change and expansion of the use over time. Other courts make the question one of pure reasonableness but qualify that by making the par ties' contemplation a factor in determining what is reasonable. As a result both considerations (value/use and intention/expectation) are present. When an uncertain written easement case involves the original parties, the parties themselves can supply the meaning and scope of the easement.57 If the litigants are successors, the inquiry will revolve around reasonable expectations based on the writing.58 This method of resolving uncertain written easements pre serves some of the values of the expectations/intentions approach. Some cases also recognize that the dominant owner's right is to a use, and as long as the use is not clearly proscribed, the right has more or less value depending on its extent.59 Recall that for the dominant owner the easement has value only as a use or poten tial use; there is no value to possession or exclusion. The servient owner, on the other hand, has all of the rights that do not interfere unreasonably with the domi nant owner's use of the easement. In assessing the rights of the dominant owner, courts add the use/value consideration to the inquiry in terms of reasonable use or rule of reason. In some cases the courts use the circumstances existing at the time the easement was granted to determine what is a reasonable use.60 In other cases, that information may be relevant, but the use at creation will not freeze the 54Nadeau v. Town of Durham, 129 N.H. 663, 531 A.2d 335 (1987). 55Sakansky v. Wein, 86 N.H. 337, 169 A. 1 (1933). 56See Magna, Inc. v. Catranis, 512 So. 2d 912 (Ala. 1987). 57See Brown Properties, Inc. v. Looper, 293 Ark. 133, 732 S.W.2d 471(1987) (the trial court used testimony of the parties to find the meaning of an easement it deemed ambiguous). 58See Davis v. Bruk, 411 A.2d 660 (Me. 1980) (the court in a relocation case spoke of protecting the "settled expectations" of the dominant owner who would be affected by a unilateral relocation). 59Many easements are very general in terms. Rights of way may or may not be interpreted to include utilities. Compare Ware v. Pub. Serv. Co., 412 A.2d 84 (Me. 1980) (utilities allowed) with Castanza v. Wagner, 43 Wash. App. 770, 719 P.2d 949 (1986) (a few grants are simply of an ease ment). See Kelly v. Schmelz, 439 S.W.2d 211 (Mo. Ct. App. 1969). 60Nadeau v. Town of Durham, 129 N.H. 663, 531 A.2d 335 (1987).</page><page sequence="13">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 115 easement forever in time; other factors, including the advantage gained and lost by the change/expansion, may be considered in trying to decide what is reason able.61 Presumably, regardless of which approach th? tourt emphasizes, the owners made some adjustments in the price paid for their parcels. The adjustment may have been inadequate, either too high or too low, depending on the court's deci sion in a particular case, but at least it was taken into account. Some compensa tion was paid and received. 2. Implied Easements An implied easement arises when the owner of a parcel of land, who has made an open, permanent, and reasonably necessary use of one part of the land for the benefit of another part, severs the two parts. The use, which until sever ance was only a quasi-easement, may become an easement.62 Some authorities view the creation of implied easements as giving effect to the expectations of the parties, or at least those of the dominant owner.63 A sec ond justification is that the common owner began the use (the quasi-easement) because of the efficiencies of devoting one parcel (quasi-servient) to the benefit of another (quasi-dominant); the creation of the implied easement continues this economically efficient arrangement.64 A third view suggests there is an obligation on the parties to communicate about the quasi-easement; if they do not, it con tinues as an easement.65 Since there is no writing to examine, the courts, when dealing with implied easements, may turn to a more clearly fictional imputed intent or contemplation, or, again, they may discuss the matter in terms of a reasonable use.66 Courts facing change/expansion questions with implied easements some times observe that the parties will be presumed to have contemplated the normal development of the dominant property and the change/expansion required to reasonably serve that development. Conversely, the parties to the original trans action may not have had any real intention with respect to the easement; how ever, the easement may have arisen because of facts that were not inconsistent with an intention. Putting aside the problem of hidden easements,67 the easement 61Sakansky v. Wein, 86 .H. 337, 169 A. 1 (1933). "Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 84, at 444-45. 63R.

Haverkamp, American Property Law 629 (1987). 65Sterk, supra note 49, at 97-98. Sterk posits a norm of neighborliness, requiring some notifica tion and communication between parties who are or are becoming neighbors. This norm both shapes and is shaped by the doctrines of implication and prescription and reflects an attempted resolution of the tension between the values of selflessness and self interest. 66Fristoe v. Drapeau, 35 Cal. 2d 5, 215 P.2d 729 (1950). 675ee generally Eichengrun, The Problem of Hidden Easements and the Subsequent Good Faith Purchaser Without Notice, 40 Okla. L. Rev. 1 (1987). The article adopts a solution to its problem similar to the solution proposed in this article.</page><page sequence="14">116 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 probably continued to exist in a way that was apparent to both the dominant and servient successor owners.68 But what expectations did each have with respect to this? Obviously, their expectations cannot be based on a writing since there is none, but rather must be based upon the easement itself or its actual use at the time of the conveyance. Two approaches may be taken in this situation. It might be supposed that the buyer of servient land saw the easement and, because there was no recorded writ ing, assumed that an easement did not exist or was limited to its current use. Pro tecting this expectation would mean a very restrictive view of the easement. On the other hand, a dominant buyer might have assumed that the easement was the equivalent of an uncertain written easement. This would suggest a greater scope.69 The expectation/intention consideration is of little use in formulating ques tions that can be answered in terms of how much change was expected and how much change should be allowed. Do the other considerations provide any more help? One could begin by saying that each party owns an interest and, in general, is entitled to some use, shifting the focus to the use/value consideration. The next issue is how to balance the interest of each party to a reasonable use. At a mini mum, the effect of the change/expansion on both parcels and on other possible uses for them should be considered. Courts again may talk of the application of a rule of reason, as with uncertain written easements. Finally, there is some room to apply the compensation/consideration princi ple. The presumption is that the original parties took the easement into account in their transaction. (That may well be open to question since manifestly they ignored or missed it for some purposes.) But since the easement was sufficiently apparent to prevent the operation of the recording acts, successors should have made some adjustments in their payments or decisions with respect to the property. As with the uncertain written easements, they may have guessed wrongly, but they had an op portunity to adjust. Thus, all three considerations may have some impact in setting the scope of an implied easement. There is some indication that the room for change/expansion for implied easements is more limited than for written ones or, from another point of view, that the original scope is smaller.70 68With many written easements there are two opportunities to discover the easement. One chance comes when the land itself is examined. Many easements will usually be apparent in an in spection of the property. The second comes in a title search, which will reveal a recorded easement. But implied and prescriptive easements do not appear on record until a judicial proceeding confirms their existence. 69A party's reasonable expectations will be protected. The question then is what sort of expecta tions are reasonable. Any expectation not supported by a recorded instrument might be considered unreasonable, but clearly this is not the case since unwritten easements, if apparent, are protected against the operation of the recording acts. Of course, expectation protection doctrines always raise the problem of the legally sophisticated party whose expectation, protected by the law, may be based (at least in part) on the knowledge that the law sometimes protects expectations. Without resolving that circularity, the problem here is typical of the problems generated by the softness or indetermi nacy of scope rules and is another reason for adopting the proposal of this article. 70See Long v. Sendelbach, 56 Or. App. 158, 641 P.2d 1136(1982) (suggesting greater scope or expansion change for a written than an implied easement).</page><page sequence="15">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 117 3. Prescriptive Easements Today most jurisdictions view prescription of private easements as a special case of adverse possession, involving a wrongful use rather than a wrongful pos session of the property of the true owner.71 In fact, if a trespasser's conduct falls short of possession, it may still create a prescriptive easement.72 Usually the courts adopt whatever tests they have for adverse possession, modified to deal with wrongful use.73 Virtually any justification that has been offered for adverse possession can be offered for prescriptive easements.74 Professor Sterk suggests that at the initial stages a wrongful use probably does not interfere significantly with the servient owner's use. If it did, the servient owner would act to stop it. This failure to act suggests that the costs of stopping are relatively small and ex ceed the loss of value. Because the dominant owner clearly values the use (or would not make it), the doctrine apparently awards the entitlement to the highest valuing user.75 It is rare for the courts to discuss the scope of a prescriptive easement in terms of the intent of the parties; it is rarer still for that discussion to be appropriate.76 Even those courts that may still cling to the fiction of the lost grant as the basis of prescription know that it is a fiction and that there is no lost grant to interpret.77 Because courts cannot honestly look to the intention of the parties, they usu ally abandon the expectation/intention principle. Some courts may discuss the matter as a test of the presumed contemplation of the servient owner. They will find that the use is permissible if it could reasonably have been foreseen during the prescriptive period, or not permissible if the servient owner would have ob jected to the use during the prescriptive period.78 What seems to trouble the courts most about the prescriptive easement is that its creation is contrary to the compensation/consideration principle. The servient owner has received nothing in return for the easement. Not only has the domi 71 Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 8.7. 72Maryland &amp; Pa. R.R. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., 224 Md. 34,166 A.2d 247 (1960). 73An occasional opinion may still recite lost grant requirements even when not appropriate. See, e.g., Zollinger v. Frank, 110 Utah 514, 175 P.2d 714 (1946). The lost grant fiction probably devel oped as a pleading device in early common law. It has now been almost entirely replaced by the adverse possession analog. See Lehigh Valley R.R. v. McFarlan, 43 N.J.L. 605 (1881) (extended dis cussion of the lost grant and some of its ramifications). 74See, e.g., Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc., 35 Cal. 3d 564, 199 Cal. Rptr. 773, 676 P.2d 584 (1984). See Merrill, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Adverse Possession, 79 NW. U.L. Rev. 1122, at 1126-37 (1985) (critical rehearsal of adverse possession rationales). 75Sterk, supra note 49, at 78-79. 76lf a prescriptive easement arises from a defective document, the doctrine of color of title might be used to allow a use fully consistent with the writing even though only a partial use was made during the prescriptive period. See Yakima Valley Canal Co. v. Walker, 76 Wash. 2d 90, 455 P.2d 372 (1969); but see Lacy v. Schmitz, 639 S.W.2d 97 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (rejecting use of a deed reference to expand the size of a prescriptive easement). 77See, e.g., Shellow v. H?gen, 9 Wis. 2d 506, 101 N.W.2d 694 (1960). 78Connolly v. McDermott, 162 Cal. App. 3d 973,208 Cal. Rptr. 796 (1984). This is a potentially self-proving test. Because the servient owner objects now, the servient owner would have objected during the prescriptive period.</page><page sequence="16">118 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 nant owner escaped liability for a long period of trespass, which led to the crea tion of the easement, the owner is also now entitled, without making any further payment, to continue to do those formerly wrongful acts. It does not seem fair.79 It seems even less fair if the dominant owner can make changes that will increase the impact on the servient owner and further reduce the value of the servient land without payment.80 The issue of expansion and scope of prescriptive easements is usually discussed in terms of the impact on the servient estate and the need not to penalize the party further. Of course, the parties have their respective interests in land, but the reasonable use of the easement is usually limited to the use that created it. The servient owner's interest in not being further subjected to unjust impoverishment overcomes the interests of the dominant owner in realizing more of the value of the easement.81 For parties other than the original parties to the prescriptive easement (the original grantor who got nothing and the original grantee who acquired a valuable right without paying), there is less justification for letting the compensation/consideration principle prevail totally and ignoring the expectation/intention and use/value considerations. In a number of situa tions, a grantee would be hard-pressed to discover, whether an easement was prescriptive, implied, or written but unrecorded. If the easement is apparent enough to prevent its termination by operation of the recording acts, parties can be expected to have taken it into account in their acquisition of the property.82 Thus, there is some justification for treating an old prescriptive easement with more latitude in terms of scope expansion than a new one.83 4. Easements By Necessity An easement by necessity is created when the owner of a parcel divides the land, leaving a part of it without access to a public way. The owner of the land locked parcel is entitled to an easement by necessity across the other parcel to reach the public way.84 Easements by necessity may be a species of implied ease ments arising out of the intention of the parties.85 A second view is that easements 79Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc., 139 Cal. App. 3d 260, 188 Cal. Rptr. 563 (1983), vacated, 35 Cal. 3d 564, 676 P.2d 584,199 Cal. Rptr. 773 (1984). The opinion is fully reported only in 188 Cal Rptr. 563. 80Cushman v. Davis, 80 Cal. App. 3d 731, 145 Cal. Rptr. 791 (1978). 8]But see Farmer v. Kentucky Utils. Co., 642 S.W.2d 579 (Ky. 1982) (allowing secondary ease ments to clear undergrowth along a prescriptive easement for electric transmission lines because nec essary to the basic use of the primary easement). 82But see Campbell v. Great Miami Aerie No. 2309, Fraternal Order of Eagles, 15 Ohio St. 3d 79, 472 N.E.2d 711 (1984) (this court confuses the "apparent" requirement of an implied easement with the degree of visibility that will protect an unrecorded interest from the operation of the recording act). 83ln Hayes v. City of Loveland, 651 P.2d 466 (Colo. Ct. App. 1982), the court spoke of increases in the scope of the easement from the time the present servient owner acquired his land. 84Even without the existing use it is assumed that the parties intended the landlocked parcel to have access. Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 8.5, at 447-48. 85United States v. 176.10 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated in the Towns of Truro and Wellfleet, 558 F. Supp. 1379 (D. Mass. 1983).</page><page sequence="17">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 119 by necessity arise out of a policy that disfavors the inaccessibility and economic uselessness of land.86 If easements by necessity are implied, they are normally treated like other implied easements. The same considerations apply. Courts that create them out of a policy favoring at least some available use of land (the dominant estate) might take one of two views. They could either suppose that the balance of value and use has been struck in favor of the dominant land already (favoring the use/value principle) and, therefore, allow virtually any use reasonably connected to the use of the dominant estate.87 Or they may allow a fairly expansive use but apply the compensation principle and require the dominant owner to attempt to meliorate the effect of the easement on the servient land.88 5. Easements By Estoppel or Part Performance The typical easement by estoppel begins with one owner's permission to an other to use the first owner's land. Money or effort is expended in reliance on the continued availability of the use. If the reliance was reasonable and the expendi ture sufficient, the servient owner is estopped to deny the grant of an easement, plead the Statute of Frauds, or revoke the license.89 Another approach takes an oral conveyance of an easement out of the Statute of Frauds by part perfor mance.90 The cases range from clear oral licenses that should be ineffective to create an easement?where the reliance rationale seems misplaced?to written grants of easements that are thwarted for technical reasons.91 86The courts impose an easement across the other parcel (without compensation) to allow some use of the land. Traders, Inc. v. Bartholomew, 142 Vt. 486, 459 A.2d 974 (1983). 87United States v. 176.10 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated in the Towns of Truro and Wellfleet, 558 F. Supp. 1379 (D. Mass. 1983). 88Traders, Inc. v. Bartholomew, 142 Vt. 486, 459 A.2d 974 (1983). Some courts also limit the scope of the easement in terms of time; when the necessity ends and, for example, direct access to a public highway becomes available, the easement by necessity ends. W. Burby, Handbook of the Law of Real Property ? 29 (3d ed. 1965). 89Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 8.8. The Proposed Restatement?Servitudes, supra note 7, ? 2.9, offers a somewhat clearer treatment of creation problems. Attempts to create easements that fail because of non-compliance with the Statute of Frauds are taken out of the statute if the benefi ciary of the attempt has changed position so that injustice can be avoided only by giving effect to the parties' intention to create an easement. In other informal transactions, an easement may be created if permission is given or a representation is made that an easement exists, and reliance on the non revocation of the permission or the truth of the representation is foreseeable, and the claimant changes position in that reliance. id. ? 2.10. These provisions may regularize the creation issues, but they leave scope untouched except insofar as taking written failures outside of the Statute of Frauds allows them to be interpreted as any written easement. 90R. Browder, R. Cunningham &amp; A. Smith, Basic Property Law 540-42 (4th ed. 1984). The ration ale chosen may make a difference in how the servient owner may eliminate the use and in the length and scope of the use. 91 See Conard, Unwritten Agreement for the Use of Land, 14 Rocky Mtn. L. Rev. 153 (1942). Some courts prefer to bring these cases within the domain of prescriptive easements; others are uncomfortable with that notion because they view the initial use as permissive and therefore not wrongful. Compare Ricen baw v. Kraus, 157 Neb. 723, 61 N.W.2d 350 (1953) (no prescription with oral grant) with Washburn v. Esser, 9 Wash. App. 169, 511 P.2d 1387 (1973) (easement by prescription with oral agreement).</page><page sequence="18">120 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 There are so few cases concerning the scope, as opposed simply to the crea tion, of easements by estoppel, that it is difficult to evaluate which principles a court is likely to apply. To establish the easement, courts use the principles of expectation/intention and compensation/consideration. The use of the succes sors' expectations would also be appropriate because the easement or license in place may be difficult to distinguish from other unwritten easements. Once courts determine that a change or expansion is permissible or within the scope of the easement, the dominant owner may make the change. Although the prevailing dominant owner may be required to do the minimum amount nec essary to make the permitted use,92 the courts seldom expressly require meliora tion.93 Direct payments to the servient owner to compensate for any increased impact are not required on the assumption that the servient owner discounted for the easement in acquiring the property. When the servient owner wins, the domi nant owner can negotiate with the servient owner for an increase in use, find an other and probably less efficient method of developing the property (e.g., buying an easement from some other neighbor), or forego the development driven change in use of the dominant estate. The doctrinal and remedial arrangement that results from the considerations can be briefly described as follows: A written easement that is so certain that it answers the question on its face will be given effect regardless of the rationality of the result. Expansion will be allowed or denied according to the terms of the writing. Unless specified in the writing, no compensation will be paid or melioration enforced. An uncertain written easement will be interpreted in accordance with the supposed intention or contemplation of the parties or a rule of reason balancing their interests. If expansion is allowed, no compensation or melioration is re quired. An implied easement will be tested for change/expansion in accordance with a clearly fictional intention or contemplation of the parties, or a rule of rea son balancing their interests. There is less likelihood of change in scope or ex pansion with implied easements. If expansion is allowed, it is without compensa tion or melioration. For both uncertain written and implied easements, courts may ascribe a con templation of "normal" growth to the parties. A prescriptive easement will be tested for expansion by a fairly strict adher ence to the use that created the easement, allowing limited room for expansion. Great attention is paid to the impact on the servient estate. If expansion is al lowed, it is allowed without compensation or melioration. Easements by estoppel appear only rarely in scope cases. They will probably 92Birdsey v. Kosienski, 140 Conn. 403, 101 A.2d 274 (1953). 93Traders, Inc. v. Bartholomew, 142 Vt. 486, 459 A.2d 974 (1983).</page><page sequence="19">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 121 be treated like prescriptive easements because they are created by conduct. But since they are rare, no good prediction can be made.94 This arrangement gives the courts a great deal of latitude in dealing with un certain easements that grow out of more or less voluntary transactions. There is a smaller, but nevertheless significant, area of latitude with prescriptive easements, especially the older ones.95 Courts that attempt to carry out the intention of the parties, and even those that apply a rule of reason, do not recognize the considerable area of overlap between the rights and expectations of dominant and servient owners, or the need to accommodate both parties.96 Rather they operate on the assumption that they are drawing the exact line of demarcation between the rights of the parties. Once the decision as to use is made, injunctive relief seems to flow automati cally; there is no place for the equitable hardship doctrine that relieves some of the problems in nuisance law.97 The use/value principle, and the tests it promotes, are significantly like nui sance doctrine. The conflict that arises is often the result of changing patterns of land use, or technological developments that may result in a greater impact on the servient property. F. The Problem Reprised How do these considerations and doctrines apply to Donna and Stanley? Suppose that the easement was created in 1895 when the original owner split the land and conveyed the rear half to Donna's predecessor "together with a way for teams and horses." Without going into the details of results in every jurisdiction, the following are conclusions about probable results or at least the questions a court likely will ask. 1. Subdivision In general if the easement is, as here, appurtenant, the dominant owner may subdivide the land and each parcel will continue to be entitled to use the ease 94Estoppel typically involves a non-payment situation so there is some similarity to prescription, but the servient owner has usually made some sort of representation on which the dominant owner relied and is thus perhaps less blameless than the merely nonfeasant servient owner against whom prescription runs. 95For an expansive prescriptive scope case, see Glenn v. Poole, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 423 N.E.2d 1030(1981). 96For a pictorial representation of overlap in nuisance, see C. Donahue, T. Kauper &amp; P. Martin, Property 1078 (2d ed. 1983). 97Some cases, of course, may be simple declaratory judgments or may involve damages together with an injunction. Injunctions are also available to prevailing dominant owners to prevent interfer ence with a permissible use. While laches will sometimes prevent an injunction, Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash. 2d 366, 373, 715 P.2d 514, 518 (1986), the doctrine of comparative or equitable hardship seems not to be applied. For a discussion of possible application of comparative hardship in certain easement cases, see Griffin v. Red Run Lodge, Inc., 610 F.2d 1198,1201-03 (4th Cir. 1979), noted 38 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 709 (1981). Fora case denying injunctive relief for nuisance, see Boomer v. Atlan tic Cement Co., 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870, 309 N.Y.S.2d 312 (1970).

Mode Over the years, teams and horses have undoubtedly yielded to tractors and trucks. If the language limited the use to horses, the use may have expanded by prescription, but then there would be stricter limits on the use.100 More likely, the language of the easement will be read broadly, making the easement a general one and allowing the change of use.101 3. Increased Traffic This is a written easement, and it seems likely that the increased traffic associ ated with the change in use will be allowed. Some decisions, however, may look to the contemplation of the original parties and closely limit use intensity to the original use and its impact. Others, even from the same jurisdiction, will allow more change and let the intensity increase.102 4. Paving If it can be shown that paving is necessary in light of a permissibly increased use, then it is likely that a written easement will allow the changes on the sur face.103 Even prescriptive easements may be paved if the changes can be reasona bly related to a permitted use and do not unduly burden the servient estate. Some courts are more restrictive than others in this regard.104 ^Cunningham, Property, supra note 37, ? 8.9, at 459. "See, e.g., Bang v. Forman, 244 Mich. 571, 222 N.W. 96 (1928). A close reading of this case suggests that it is the use of the dominant parcel (the nuisance effect) rather than the easement that is objectionable. Limiting the use of the easement precluded any nuisance effect. 100W. Burby, Handbook of the Law of Real Property ? 32, at 87 (3d ed. 1965). To the extent of the changes, the stricter notions applicable to prescription would apply. 101See Stevens v. Anderson, 393 A.2d 158 (Me. 1978). A 1915 reservation for "cattle teams and foot passengers" was said to be an idiomatic expression for all forms of travel and general enough to allow cars and trucks. W2Compare Brock v. &amp; M Moster Farms, Inc., 481 N.E.2d 1106 (Ind. Ct. App. 1985) (limiting change/expansion rights under a way for "horses, wagons, vehicles and persons on foot") with Ende rle v. Sharman, 422 N.E.2d 686 (Ind. Ct. App. 1981 ) (interpreting broadly an easement implied from a deed). See also Nadeau v.

Size This may be the most limiting factor. Many courts seem to set the size of an easement of way accordingto its original use.105 This does not appear logical if the size is not expressly stated and the permitted changes in use require changes in size. Consequently, courts are apparently more willing to allow a larger size than the original use.106 An emphasis on the expectation/intention principle would lead a court to seek the intentions of Donna's and Stanley's remote grantors. It could look to the usage of teams and horses in 1895 and find that those owners contemplated nor mal change in use and then determine if the proposed change was normal. Alter natively, the court might focus on the current parties and see if Donna's proposed change/expansion was reasonable considering land use patterns, the advantage to her, and the detriment to Stanley. This emphasizes the use/value principle. The court might consider whether the change, if allowed, would unduly restrict Stanley's use and reduce the value of his property. If Stanley loses value, his dis count (based on reasonable use and normal change) is inaccurate. He receives no compensation for his additional loss and Donna makes no new payment for her advantage. Thus, there is no good answer to give to Donna and Stanley, and a lawyer's prediction of the outcome would be, at best, a gamble.107 II. The Present Arrangement Evaluated This section evaluates the existing arrangements for resolving easement dis putes on the bases of efficiency, fairness, utility, neighborliness, and planning. New arrangements are then suggested and analyzed. Although other tests might have been chosen, these represent a fair cross section of methods of inquiry.108 A. Economic Efficiency The choice of legal rules will not affect the attainment of an economically efficient result if the parties have perfect information and there are no transaction costs.109 An efficient result is one that maximizes wealth. If the value added to Donna's property by the change/expansion is $15,000 and the harm to Stanley's 105?.g., Cushman Va. Corp. v. Barnes, 204 Va. 245, 251-52, 129 S.E.2d 633, 639 (1963). 106Horowitz v. Noble, 79 Cal. App. 3d 120,144 Cal. Rptr. 710 (1978) (holding implied easement not limited to area required by original use); Applegate v. Ota, 146 Cal. App. 3d 702,194 Cal. Rptr. 331 (1983) (awarding prescriptive easement wider than the road because servient owners actually used the additional area when meeting opposing traffic on road). 107The gambler gets a second shot in some jurisdictions where the appellate courts redetermine almost every appealed case. In others, the opposite approach prevails. Inconsistent opinions by lower courts are simply approved and not reconciled. One can compare New Hampshire, where easement scope cases are routinely affirmed, to Oregon, where they are usually modified, if not reversed. 108These criteria have been used to test, explain, or validate a number of property law doctrines, chiefly nuisance, but also adverse possession and the creation of unwritten easements. 109See generally Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J. Law &amp; Econ. 1 (1960). A good explana tion can be found in A. Polinsky, An Introduction to Law and Economics 11-24 (1983).</page><page sequence="22">124 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 property from the change in easement use is $10,000 then whether Donna or Stanley makes the choice, the change will occur. If Donna has the right, she will proceed; if Stanley has the right, she will buy him out. Alternatively, if the in crease in value to Donna's property is $5,000 and the damage remains at $10,000, then regardless of who has the right, the change will not be made. If Donna has the right, Stanley will buy it. If he has the right, he will not sell it.110 This is, however, a world of imperfect information, of transaction costs, and other impediments to the parties' attainment of an efficient result. Given that, Posner suggests the adoption of legal rules that minimize transaction costs, to allow the market to act and, if that is impossible, the wealth maximizing ap proach would mirror the market.111 The plethora of change/expansion cases reported suggests that not all parties are bargaining to efficient results. What is causing the problems in resolving these cases? The main impediments seem to be the problems of bilateral monopoly (strategic bargaining) and the uncertainty of litigation. A relatively small number of cases reflect clear spite. The transaction costs112 that impede resolution of many disputes seem absent: it is easy enough to locate the servient or dominant owner, there are less likely to be holdouts since there are fewer parties, and there are usually no free riders on the dominant side. Some costs persist. The nuisance effect has an impact, and nonservient owners may encourage a servient owner to hold out to prevent a use of land to which they object. A bi lateral monopoly exists in most easement cases because the servient owner can sell the right to expand or change the use of the easement only to the dominant owner. For the dominant owner, the expansion of the easement will invariably be cheaper than other op tions for acquiring access to the dominant property. In the hypothetical case, Donna could use the county road or acquire an easement from another neighbor, but the costs, both out-of-pocket and transactional, involved in those options probably exceed the cost of improving the existing road. The dominant owner would be willing to pay an amount up to slightly below the added value of the land.113 A servient owner with the right to veto any expan sion would accept no figure below the loss of value to the land. A servient owner without a veto would accept any amount. Even when the allocation is clear, a bilateral monopoly may prevent or impede the parties from negotiating to an effi 110lf there is impact from the changed use of the dominant land in addition to the impact caused by the changed use of the easement, the nuisance effect (see supra note 40), it will affect the servient owner's decision. A nuisance effect of an additional $10,000 loss of value should lead the servient owner to buy out the dominant owner or to refuse to sell out in either case. niR. Posner, Economic Analysis of the Law 13-15 (3d ed. 1986). 11 transaction costs are the costs to the parties of reaching a settlement of a dispute. They will include the costs of identifying parties with whom to negotiate, acquiring information, bargaining, excluding free riders, and administering a settlement. See generally Cooter, The Cost ofCoase, 11J. Legal Stud. 1,16-17(1982); A. Polinsky, Law and Economics 11 -14, 17-20 (1983). 113The dominant owner will pay the least of improving the existing easement, improving the county road, or getting a new easement. There will, of course, be expenses in discovering the costs of the various choices and reluctance to pay those may cause the dominant owner, initially at least, to focus on a single choice, the one perceived as least expensive.</page><page sequence="23">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 125 cient result if they engage in strategic bargaining. Strategic bargaining may result from the parties' misperceptions in the selection of initial strategies, from a belief that they need to appear tough for other purposes or from other reasons. The Coase theorem supposes, and many commentators agree, that eventually virtu ally all strategic bargaining problems can be resolved as the bargaining process produces more and better information.114 But if there is a time constraint, strategic bargaining may actually prevent resolution of the dispute; even without time lim its, not all disputes, even simple experimental models, can be resolved. In the real world "[Litigation drags on for months, strikes occur, nations persist in wars."115 If bargaining costs are high, it may be advantageous not to bargain. The costs of identifying the parties, acquiring general information about values, and excluding free riders are not likely to be high in most easement cases. In addition, bargaining, like litigation, can consume assets that might be better used in the improvement of society.116 Adding to the difficulty of pre-litigation settlement in easement cases (as in some nuisance cases) is the uncertainty of result and what might be called the jackpot effect. The servient owner who wins has a potential payoff well in excess of any damage, and he wi 11 bargai for a share of the i ncreased val ue to the dorn i nant tenement. Assuming that some reasonable return is left to the dominant ten ant on any investment that must be made, the rest is available to the servient owner.117 The dominant owner who wins takes all the value added to the property and needs to make no compensation or melioration. Logically, the parties will or should reach some decision based on the probability of success by either party, the amount of damage, and the amount of increase in value. Because the rule is indeterminate, however, no one can make an accurate estimate of the probability of success in the lawsuit. 114Cooter suggests that Coase's view of rational wealth maximizers is a philosophical one and that what Cooter labels a Hobbesian view of people as atavistic and recalcitrant is also entitled to consideration. Cooter, supra note 112, at 18-20. Some experimentation supports Coase, but even there some minimum of negotiations fail. Hoffman &amp; Spitzer, Experimental Law and Economics, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 991 (1985). Ellickson's field data suggest resolutions occur, but that they are not al ways efficient. Ellickson, Of Coase and Cattle: Dispute Resolution Among Neighbors in Shasta County, 38 Stan. L. Rev. 623 (1986) [hereinafter Ellickson, Coase). See Sterk, supra note49, at 69-74, for an extensive discussion of bilateral monopolies and strategic bargaining. The literature is re viewed in notes 64-71. 115Cooter, supra note 112, at 24. 116See Merrill, Rent Seeking and the Compensation Principle, 80 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1561, 1577 (1986) (explaining Epstein's view of taking as controlling rent-seeking behavior in the political arena). The same waste of resources can occur in trying to capture economic rent through litigation. Lawyers, after all, are accused of only dividing the pie, not making it bigger. 117The dominant owner who loses will likely bargain but may have an additional choice waiting. Presumably, the dominant owner has some use of the land and is seeking to increase the owner's return. If the servient owner seeks too much, so that other investments are more attractive, the dominant owner will invest in those, take the current return off the dominant tenement and later suggest, after some time has passed, the proposed change has become a normal development and is permissible.</page><page sequence="24">126 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 The parties also might try to reach an agreement that meliorates some or all of the potential damage caused by the increase, if that cost was less than the dam age. The present arrangement does not forbid this, but neither does it encourage it. A winning servient owner has gains beyond either damage or melioration; the winning dominant owner has no obligation at all.118 If the parties cannot reach agreement, the court could try to choose an eco nomically efficient solution. Although the battle necessarily will be of expert tes timony, which can differ significantly,119 the court could reach some reasonable conclusions regarding the parties' damages and benefits from the change. But courts have consistently rejected this efficiency standard in determining the scope of easements as well as in most other disputes between dominant and ser vient owners.120 Merrill has suggested that in cases where there are high transaction costs the courts have developed soft rules to facilitate their ability to find the economically efficient solution under the guise of reasonableness. When transaction costs are low, and the market can work easily, hard-and-fast, sharp-edged rules facilitate the operation of the market.121 In easement scope cases, the principal transaction costs are the strategic bargaining, based on a bilateral monopoly, and the inher ent flexibility of the rules. Unlike nuisance cases, in which flexibility may help solve the problem, the soft rule in easement cases tends to create a kind of vicious 118ln some cases, the dominant owner will be able to meliorate the damage to the servient prop erty by the way the expansion is carried out and a more efficient result could be achieved. Some cases suggest that the permitted use must be done in a way that minimizes the impact on the servient land. Birdseyv. Kosienski, 140 Conn. 403,101 A.2d 274 (1943). But the court is probably not particularly able to make that kind of determination and the costs of making it may be so large that the gains will be wiped out. Note, An Economic Analysis of Land Use Conflicts, 21 Stan. L. Rev. 293, 296 (1969) (dis cussing the problems of accommodating conflicting uses in nuisance cases). If melioration is possi ble, it will be in both parties' interests to pursue and achieve it. The proposed rule will maximize, or perhaps increase, the servient owner's use of land at no cost over the compensation remedy and will be a reduction in the amount due from the dominant owner. 1195ee, e.g., Askari v. R &amp; R Land Co., 179 Cal. App. 3d 1101, 225 Cal. Rptr. 285 (1986) (where expert valuations of a parcel of land varied from $1,000,000 to $1,400,000, a difference of some 40% of the lower figure). 120ln Aztec, Ltd. v. Creekside Inv. Co., 100 Idaho 566, 602 P.2d 64 (1979), a prescriptive ease ment over a 6' 50' strip of land that the servient owner initially was not aware he owned was limited to the creating use; no expansion was allowed even in the absence of actual injury. A large apartment development was thus held hostage to the servient owner. No consideration of relative impact and cost of the decision was attempted. See also Hatfield v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co., 85 N.C. App. 438, 355 S.E.2d 199 (1987). A servient owner blocked an old passway and claimed that there was no harm to the dominant owner, and, if there were, damages could replace the loss. The court said: Our research has found no authority for the proposition that a private property owner must give up his interest in an easement because a second property owner wants to pay him damages for taking away that easement so that a more economical use of the second owner's property can be pursued. We decline to so hold. 85 N.C. App. at 445-46, 355 S.E.2d at 203. 121Merrill, Trespass, Nuisance and the Cost of Determining Property Rights, 14 J.

Nothing short of allowing some kind of eminent domain will eliminate completely the problems of bilateral monopoly, but the present arrangement could be changed in a way that lessens the potential for strategic bargaining and perhaps leads to more settlements and less litigation. B. Fairness A common objection to a legal rule justified on the basis of economic effi ciency is that the results produced by the rule are not fair. Assuming that fairness is an appropriate standard for the validity of legal arrangements, there can be more disagreement about what is fair than about what is efficient. It may be easier to find attributes of an unfair result than to define fairness in any comprehensive way.122 The three most common attributes are lack of proportionality, random ness, and unexpectedness. There is a greater concern with a loss that is disproportionate to the lapse or fault that occasions it than there is to a disproportionate reward.123 Indeed, unjust impoverishment or forfeiture causes more concern than unjust enrichment. Courts frequently hold that equity will not enforce a forfeiture. Some courts will call it extortion to insist on a legal right with small value to the holder compared to the value to another of its release.124 Randomness and unexpectedness are in some ways linked. It is unfair that a party has to suffer a loss when there has been no chance to prepare for, take into account, or plan around the causal event. It is unfair if there does not seem to be a logical explanation why one party is enriched and another impoverished. Ran domness clearly interferes with our view that people should be able to plan and depend on consistent results.125 What if a coin flip entitled the grasshopper to the 122Ellickson notes the problems of defining fairness. Ellickson, Alternatives to Zoning: Cove nants, Nuisance Rules, and Fines as Land Use Controls, 40 U. Chi. L. Rev. 681 (1973) [hereinafter Ellickson, Alternatives]. Rabin prefers to use fault and innocence instead of fairness as a standard for al locating entitlements in nuisance. Rabin, Nuisance Law: Rethinking Fundamental Assumptions, 63 Va. L. Rev. 1299 (1977). Michelman discusses fairness at length and ultimately proposes a Rawlsian definition. Michelman, Property, Utility and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of just Compensation Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165 (1980). Ellickson may have rephrased Michelman's stan dard most understandably: The person bearing a loss should be able to perceive that the bad effect of the rule on people in his situation is most likely to promote the welfare of people like him in the long run. Ellickson, Alternatives, at 691 n. 30. Michelman's ultimate conclusion seems to be that fairness is so elusive that, at least in compensation cases, utility is a better measure. 123See Rose, Crystals and Mud in Property Law, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 577, 598 (1988). 124Kratovil, Easement Law and Service of Non-dominant Tenements Time for a Change, 24 Santa Clara L. Rev. 649 (1984) (addresses prevention of legal extortion by servient owners); Note, The Easement in Gross Revisited: Transferability and Divisibility Since 1945, 39 Vand. L.

Va. 586, 34 S.E.2d 348 (1945) (criticizing an extortionate nuisance plaintiff). In part, the doctrine of equitable hardship in nuisance cases reflects an anti-extortion view. See supra note 90. Others, of course, see no extortion. There is no threat of an illegal act, only the assertion of legal rights. Note, Injunction Negotiations: An Economic, Moral and Legal Analysis, 27 Stan. L.

The present arrangement has great potential for unfairness on all of these counts. The servient owner who loses bears all the costs while the dominant owner reaps all of the profits. Thus, there is a possibility of both unjust enrich ment and unjust impoverishment. The servient owner who wins, is in a position to extort from the dominant owner an amount clearly in excess of the amount of the damage.126 If the servient owner has already discounted the possible injury that the change will cause, it is neither unexpected nor random. The original grantor sup posedly contemplated that the easement would expand consistently with the normal growth patterns and that new technologies would arise. If the current ser vient owner is a successor, that owner knew that the easement existed and ex pected some expansion of the easement and discounted for the foreseeable loss in value.127 Thus, there is no unfairness. That the change/expansion will reduce the present value of the land strongly suggests that potential buyers, and by exten sion the current owner, did not properly discount based on the possible change/ expansion. If there is no change in price, there is no damage and, presumably, no harm.128 Courts are able to apply flexible rules as they see fit and, depending on the rule for review, the result is either an unappealable ad hoc decision by the lower 126Of course, the winning servient owner is not extorting from an economic point of view, but is only exploiting an advantage, selling the asset at the highest figure possible. In our example, Stanley will charge $14,000 if he can (if Donna will pay that much). See supra text accompanying note 104. 127lt is probably more logical to look to the reasonable expectations and contemplations of the current parties to the easement than it is to discuss the more remote intention of the original parties. See supra text accompanying note 54. 128This is arguably a self-fulfilling test. If there is damage, then there is damage. It suggests measur ing the value of the land with and without the increase, a relatively discrete inquiry. There may be a problem separating the damage from the use from any nuisance effect, but comparisons to neighbor ing nonservient land should allow an accounting for that. William Manson has suggested an analysis of nuisance law that assumes that property owners will foresee certain developments, discount for them in acquiring the property, and will, therefore, not be damaged when those events occur in the normal course of change. Manson, A Re-Examination of Nuisance Law, 8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 185 (1985). To the extent that the servient owner knows of the easement and can foresee the develop ment, this rationale would apply, as well as to any servitude or other encumbrance. See Epstein, Cov enants and Constitutions, 73 Cornell L. Rev. 906 (1988). There are a number of problems that arise with his discounting notion. First, the party must be presumed to know about the encumbrance. Re cording acts and the doctrines of off-record notice should assure that. But see Eichengrun, The Prob lem of Hidden Easements and the Subsequent Purchaser for Value Without Notice, 40 Okla. L. Rev. 1 (1987). Second, being aware of the encumbrance, the person must focus on it sufficiently to take it fully into account as an individual problem. This may be problematic when the encumbrance is only one of many in a complex transaction. See Alexander, Freedom, Coercion and the Law of Servitudes, 73 Cornell L. Rev. 883, 892-95 (1988). Finally, with easements and other uncertain developments such as nuisance, the expectations are inevitably colored by the law. That is, discounts for those changes or expansions that are expected to be allowed by the law; if not expected to be allowed, there is no reason to discount for them. The effect is circular. White, Economics and Nuisance Law: Com ment on Manson, 8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 213 (1985).</page><page sequence="27">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 129 court or an opportunity for a second spin of the wheel at the appellate level.129 If the courts used the softness to reach efficient results, the results at least might be predictable. To complicate things, the varying scope of easements required addi tional legal and factual knowledge to discount. Thus, it is difficult, if not impos sible, to apply the word fair to the current arrangement. C. Utility Not all fair solutions will be economically efficient, nor will all efficient solu tions be fair. Professor Michelman recognizes this in his article on takings and suggests a utilitarian standard for determining when compensation should be made in regulation cases.130 Debate continues over whether his entire quasi mathematical structure is appropriate to resolve land use problems.131 Perhaps it is more complicated than necessary, but he makes us aware of the need to con sider all of the costs of a particular decision measured against the gains.132 He uses the concept of settlement costs as the alternative to what he terms demoral ization costs.133 From an utilitarian view, a measure is presumably desirable if it is effi cient, but it may involve a capricious ("unfair") redistribution involving demoral ization or settlement costs. If the lower of settlement and demoralization costs exceeds the efficiency gains, the proposal should be rejected, but if one or both are lower, the lowest should be paid.134 As Rabin notes, generally there is a direct if not perfect correlation between fairness and utility. "A fair measure regulating land use is more likely to encour age thrift, industry, and good order than is an unfair measure."135 A similar, though again not perfect, correlation exists between utility and efficiency. The required quasi-mathematical process that Michelman suggests is not de sirable because the current arrangement is demonstrably neither fair nor more than coincidentally efficient. Thus, the initial reaction must be that it should be rejected on utilitarian grounds. The current arrangement produces either an uncompensated servient owner or a dominant owner who must pay extra money to make a new use or give up 129See supra note 101. 130Michelman, supra note 122. 131Note, Economic Analysis of Land Use Conflicts, 21 Stan. L. Rev. 293, 306 (1969). 132Ellickson, Alternatives, supra note 122, at 689 n.25. 1 "Demoralization costs are the dollar value of the disutilities that accrue to losers and their sym pathizers, specifically from the realization that no compensation is offered and the present capital ized value of lost future production caused by demoralization of losers, sympathizers, and observers disturbed by the thought that they may be treated similarly on another occasion. Settlement costs are the dollar value of the effort and resources which would be required to reach compensation settlements adequate to avoid demoralization costs. Michelman, supra note 122, at 1214. See also Ellickson, Alternatives, supra note 122, at 688-90, for a discussion of nuisance costs, prevention costs, and administrative costs as more appropriate measures for determining utility. 134Michelman, supra note 122, at 1215. 135Rabin, supra note 122, at 1308-09.</page><page sequence="28">130 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 that use.136 In any particular case the result may be efficient, but there is no assess ment of demoralization and settlement costs so a utilitarian calculation cannot be made.137 An analysis of the current arrangement as a whole suggests that it inflicts all costs on one party. The uncertainty of the rule and its all-or-nothing result may inhibit investment by servient owners and perhaps have effects on dominant owners' choices as well. If utility means usefulness, any particular arrangement should be examined from the point of view of lawyers advising clients in arranging transactions and settling disputes. For attorneys, a rule that is clear and bright is perhaps the most useful in either situation. The lawyer can confidently predict the probable result and then help the client negotiate a result to maximize the client's advantage, if any. If lawyers cannot predict the future, they will try to control it by providing for a definite result.138 The unpredictability of the current arrangement is both an advantage and a disadvantage to a lawyer advising a client in the midst of a dispute. The disadvan tage is that the lawyer simply cannot tell the client, with any degree of accuracy, the likely result. The advantage is that the uncertainty creates real incentives to settle. This arrangement may promote the avoidance of disputes by encouraging lawyers to draft easements with some care and precision so there can be no doubt regarding outcome. The well-advised party who acquires property subject to an easement, or with an easement appurtenant, should seek to clarify or renegotiate the easement. This appears to be the exception rather than the rule; easements are not written with any sort of precision, except in very rare cases. Few lawyers 136lf the servient owner has properly accounted for the chance of change/expansion, then there are no demoralization costs when it occurs. The owner recognized not only the loss of some use of the land but also the absence of compensation. The only reason such a servient owner might resist change is to obtain some of the dominant owner's gain. The resistance might then be viewed as extor tion. The dominant owner who loses, but accounted properly, also loses nothing since that owner should not have expected to be able to make the use. Again, there is no reason to assign demoraliza tion costs. So, if parties have calculated correctly, then the result is probably utilitarian in one sense. But the point is the virtual impossibility of calculating correctly, given the combination of soft rules and difficulties of predicting any particular change in land use, or technology, or both. 137lf a servient owner experiences demoralization costs because calculation is difficult, settle ment costs (measured by the objective loss of value to the servient land) would probably prevent them. Similarly situated owners might also experience less apprehension. Efficient results would fol low since the dominant owner would proceed only when gains exceeded settlement costs. It is more of a problem to suggest settlement to a disappointed dominant owner. Frequently the payment would be inefficient, the cost of settlement loss of value because of inability to make the use would exceed the gains (the loss the use would cause) to the servient owner. Thus, compensation would not be made. In addition, to make the calculations accurate, one would have to bar absolutely the change/ expansion and, thus, preclude much, if not all, future development of the dominant land and ignore future technological changes. 138For a suggestion for the adoption of those rules that will reward the careful planner, see Eas terbrook, The Supreme Court 7983 Term?Foreword: The Court and the Economic System, 98 Harv.

Parties obtaining burdened land do not limit or clarify written or unwritten easements. D. Planning A court's decision in a change/expansion case clearly has an impact on the uses that dominant and servient owners wi II make of their land. The decision that an increased use does not overburden the servient land allows more intense use of the dominant parcel and may limit uses of the servient parcel. The new use of the dominant land has an impact on the servient land as well as on other nearby land. There is an impressive array of complex rules and arrangements to resolve disputes about permissible uses of land. Public controls, zoning, and other land use laws set limits on uses of land and are the result of political decisions. There are restrictions on the substance and process of these decisions.139 Also, a com plex and difficult system of privately imposed land use restrictions has devel oped. Distinctions are drawn on the types of promises that are made, the form of the penalty for breach of the arrangement, and the way in which the arrangement is originally set up.140 An essential voluntariness is assumed in these arrange ments. At least initially, the parties are seen to have entered the transaction will ingly, and successors voluntarily acquire the property with knowledge of the ar rangement.141 The third type of control arises without the parties' consent, and sometimes without their knowledge. Certain obligations run to neighbors without regard to the acts of government or any previous promises. A nuisance cannot be commit ted and a neighbor cannot be deprived of lateral support or be flooded by a diver sion of surface water. Usually there is some reciprocity in these involuntary con trols; absent some sort of arrangement, each neighbor has a similar obligation. There are common threads to the questions that courts deal with when they attempt to apply these control doctrines. Roughly speaking, these kinds of con cerns may be characterized as "Dead Hand v. Change in Circumstances," or "Giving Effect to Reasonable Expectations," or "Letting Everyone Use Their Property," or "Respecting the Institution of Property as a Value in Itself."142 Easements fit awkwardly within this framework. Allowing an easement to 139The adoption of rules requires certain procedures and there are safeguards against biased deci sions such as the appearance of fairness doctrine. Additionally, the rules may not be arbitrary or capri cious and may not be so limiting as to amount to a taking. The decisions are political in that they involve choices and applications of policies; they also may be political in the sense that blocs and other political arrangements determine the outcomes. 140See Symposium, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1177(1982), for a comprehensive explication and evalua tion of the law of servitudes. 141 See Alexander, Freedom, Coercion and the Law of Servitudes, 73 Cornell L. Rev. 883 (1988), for some discussion of the lack of voluntary acceptance by successors to promisors. 142See Korngold, Privately Held Conservation Servitudes: A Policy Analysis in the Context of In Gross Real Covenants and Easements, 63 Tex.

Rev. 533 (1988), for some discus sion of the values and considerations used in dealing with control and use choices.</page><page sequence="30">132 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 serve a subdivided dominant estate may decrease the value of the servient land and other adjacent land, making the dominant land more valuable at the same time. A decision in favor of the servient landowner in the same case may increase the value of the servient land because it now has one less competitor in the subdi vision field (or the cost of subdividing the dominant land is increased), or because of hold-up value, or because the use will not be made. If a winning servient owner sells out, there will be an impact on the price that the dominant owner charges to buyers within the subdivision. The losing dominant owner may buy out the servient owner or acquire an other easement and raise the price of the land to the new users of the dominant estate. Or the expense may cause a transfer of the proposed new use to other land that is not, except for the problems with the easement, as well suited for the new use. Appropriate allocation of the costs of a given use is necessary to determine if a use is truly efficient. It is also a necessary part of rational planning on any ba sis.143 Under the present arrangement, the only consideration usually given to pat terns of use is whether the change in the dominant estate is normal or foreseen and, thus, presumably allowable. Consistent with current easement doctrine, lit tle thought is given to the effect of the result on other land. Larger changes are driving the developments and affecting the decisions landowners make, and easements ought not to be used to limit those options and skew land use plans. Planning decisions for larger areas pay little if any attention to easements and other micro arrangements that exist for individual parcels. The law of nuisance and other judge-made rules fill in the gaps in the larger plans. The current ease ment arrangement throws a potential monkey wrench into those broad-based de cisions. In some cases, development can take place without a true assessment or payment of its costs if the dominant owner wins; in others, it impedes the devel opment and use of appropriate lands if the servient owner wins. E. Neighborliness Professor Sterk has observed that the creation of cross boundary rights cannot be fully explained on the basis of either intent or economic efficiency. He goes on to suggest, as a rationale for rules in this area, a norm of neighborliness. At its highest level, this norm requires or at least encourages cooperation and ata lower level requires notification, if not two-way communication, to avoid the conse quences of certain rules.144 Ellickson uses neighborliness as the basis of liability in nuisance. A nuisance is something that, measured by the standards of a fairly small area is regarded as unneighborly conduct. Ellickson seems to require coop eration, the higher level of Sterk's norm.145 Neighbors cooperate and their ar 143Note, Internalizing Externalities: Nuisance Laws and Economic Efficiency, 53 N.Y.U.

If not cooperation, at least a level of tolerance and consideration for others.</page><page sequence="31">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 133 rangements may alter or ignore clearly prescribed legal rules. Ellickson has noted that among rural landowners, at least in Shasta County, California, there was a strong impulse to settle disputes without resort to the law and to cooperate for everyone's benefit.146 The situation with easements involves not only the creation but also the defi nition of rights. No matter how the easement was created, the dominant and the servient owner are thrust into a relationship. It may have been of their own or their predecessors' making or it may have arisen simply because they or their predecessors failed to act. But they must cooperate. Economics dictate that they should cooperate to allow the uses that are most beneficial to each, but impedi ments to successful negotiation abound. Further, the arrangement as it now exists offers a number of methods of attack for the truly malicious and spiteful neighbor. Because of the uncertainties of the rules, the noncooperative neighbor is in a po sition to hold up the neighbor who seeks to make a change.147 After reaching a conclusion favoring one party or the other, often when the expansion is not allowed, a court may suggest that the parties get together and settle the dispute.148 Given the experience of courts in struggling to define bar gaining and acting in good faith in other contract areas, it is probably asking a great deal to suggest that a rule can be devised that in fact will encourage cooper ation. Of course, the present arrangement creates a situation in which cooperation is possible. But it does nothing further to encourage that cooperation to settle ment. An alternative is needed that will aid cooperation by either establishing a clear basis for bargaining or by removing some of the incentives, both financial and psychological, for non-cooperation. III. Alternative Arrangements Suggested and Evaluated The current arrangement for change/expansion disputes produces results that cannot be justified doctrinally or by considerations of fairness, efficiency, utility, planning, or neighborliness. Differentiating easements by the method of creation is superficially appealing but does not survive thoughtful consideration. There is no good reason to subject a servient owner with an easement by neces sity, with probably the least chance to discover the easement, to greater risk of 146EII?ckson, Coase, supra note 114. The impulses to settlement that Ellickson recognizes arise in part because there are long-standing and complex relationships among landowners in a region. Par ties may settle because on another occasion they may be on the other side of the question and so they see both points of view. Simply knowing the people socially tends to produce cooperation rather than litigation. When land use or technological developments are the driving force, the older web of rela tionships is less important and new actors also may be entering the picture. 147See Flower v. Valentine, 135 III. App. 3d 1034,482 N.E.2d 682 (1985), for a near classic spite case. Dominant owners also seem to sometimes act out of spite. See Bard Ranch Co. v. Weber, 557 P.2d 722 (Wyo. 1976). 148See, e.g., Dillon v. Klamut, 278 Pa. Super. 126, 420 A.2d 462 (1980).</page><page sequence="32">134 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 change/expansion than the servient owner with a prescriptive easement.149 The current remedial system seems destined to produce problems in bargaining and to encourage, rather than limit, resort to litigation. What is really at base in an easement change case? Once the change/expan sion question is reached, the concern is no longer about the entitlement to a right, but rather the dimensions of that right. A determination of the best way to adjust the parties' conflicting rights must be made. This suggests a number of possible models. Similar problems of conflicting uses arise in a variety of property situations: 1. Co-tenants may disagree as to the most efficient or otherwise most desir able use of their property. 2. A life tenant and a future interest holder may disagree about whether a building or an orchard ought to be destroyed or whether property should be used to maximize the income or preserve the corpus. 3. Neighbors may argue about how to deal with surface water. Can one owner block the water? Can the other simply run as much as possible onto the downhill owner? 4. Underground water can produce disputes even if one owner does not use the water but only wants it left in place. 5. One owner may build a tannery on her land while her neighbor wants to run a high class restaurant. The problem suggests an uncertain (either unwritten or ambiguously written) easement and a desire for change/expansion that is development driven.150 There is no easy answer to the question of whether to allow the expansion under the present situation. Once there is agreement on a need to change the existing arrangement, there are three possible ways to deal with the problem: 1. Give the servient owner veto power over any change/expansion and re tain the injunctive remedy. 2. Give the dominant owner free rein in terms of change/expansion. 3. Allow the dominant owner to change or expand the easement, but re quire payment of compensation to the servient owner for the injury caused by the change/expansion.151 149A prescriptive easement is likely to exist in the ground and be evident to a buyer. An easement by necessity might be asserted even though no prior use was made. 150These suggestions explicitly reject any distinction among easements based on the circum stances of their creation. Once there is an uncertain easement it is tested by the rules laid out below. There is no justification to distinguish among easements according to their sources and to do so leads to even more confusion. But it would be possible to limit these suggestions to, for instance, written, general easements because they are inherently discoverable and hence more voluntary. Unwritten easements might then fall under another set of rules that could provide for the servient owner's veto. 151 Compensation is calculated on the basis of the decrease in the market value of the servient property. This objective view is adopted because subjective compensation for the injury?what the servient owner would accept to allow the change/expansion?is difficult to determine and because</page><page sequence="33">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 135 The first of these solutions is basically the rule of waste, at least as it has been applied historically. Little, if any, change in the use of the property was allowed when the future interest holder objected. The doctrine's primary objective was to protect the future interest.152 The second solution is analogous to the common enemy rule of surface wa ter. The holder of a right is entitled to do what is necessary to protect the holder's interests, as long as the interests are associated with the property, and devil take the hindmost in terms of the effects on others.153 The last approach owes much to the recognition of the similarity between the change/expansion and nuisance. Courts have sometimes used language clearly reminiscent of nuisance in establishing tests for expansion and scope.154 The idea of a reasonable use suggests the balancing process inherent in nuisance. One re cent article on nuisance further points up the similarity by discussing nuisance, reasonable uses, and compensation in terms of foreseeability.155 The remedial portion of this approach obviously owes much to Calabresi and Malamed and their four choices of remedies.156 Professors Ellickson157and Rabin158 have offered various ways to use the four choices in nuisance cases.159 One advantage, or per haps disadvantage, in dealing with easements is that it is much more difficult to the basic notion is to allow development-driven changes because such an allowance with compensa tion is more efficient, more utilitarian, fairer, and leads to more rational planning. "Market-induced" may be another way of saying "development-driven"; thus the market's determination of value is used as the hallmark of efficiency and as an important factor in other determinations. The market reflects the value that society places on a parcel of land and its uses. Only by using the market's valua tion of the cost of the change/expansion can this determination be made accurately. See Note, An Economic Analysis of Land Use Conflicts, 21 Stan. L. Rev. 293, 300 (1969) (loss of use measured by market value adjusted by subjective costs). For a critique of this view see Note, Injunction Negotia tions: An Economic, Moral and Legal Analysis, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 1563,1568-69 (1975). There may, of course, be some cases where the change/expansion rebounds to the servient owner's advantage, as when a road the servient owner may also use is paved and the advantage outweighs any cost to the servient land. 152E.

Rev. 1075 (1986) [hereinafter Polinsky, Re solving Nuisance Disputes]. 159The modern trend in nuisance law is characterized by (1 ) separating the assignment of entitle ments and choice of remedies; (2) assigning entitlements on grounds of fairness, neighborliness, or similar standards; (3) choosing remedies on the basis of economic efficiency; and (4) accepting a com pensated injunction remedy in some cases.

This proposal admittedly has a bias in favor of change/expansion in easement use be cause it allows change with compensation. This preference does not reflect a de cision that development is more worthy; rather it is based on the belief that more rational land use will result from allocating costs and freeing development decision-making from the idiosyncratic constraints of easements. How do these options fare under the tests that exposed the deficiencies of the present arrangement? A. Economic Efficiency Either of the first two proposals provides an absolutely clear background for uncertain cases and allows the parties to bargain for an efficient result. Virtually every uncertainty has been removed. If the servient owner has a veto right, change will occur only when the value to the dominant property exceeds the compensation demanded by the servient owner. If the value does not exceed the compensation, then the dominant owner will not buy out the servient owner. Under the second option, the servient owner will buy out the dominant owner if the injury exceeds the value added to the dominant property. There is room for strategic bargaining, but only as to amount.160 The third choice amounts to a forced sale if the dominant owner wants to go ahead. It will produce efficient results if the court has accurate information con cerning the damage caused by the change/expansion.161 The court will not always be able to rely on assessment or similar figures, so expert or other testimony will be needed. If the parties cannot agree, the overall costs of a judicial settlement are small; but because there is still something to be litigated, there is greater possibil ity of strategic bargaining. This would suggest that the third option is less efficient than the other two. But because the entitlement is clear, the parties are only argu ing about damages, and the court will ultimately resolve that issue in the absence of an agreement. This removes much of the impedimentto bargaining and means 160This may be relatively easy bargaining since each side can gain fairly accurate factual informa tion as to lost or added value. Skillful appraisers will probably be able to assess increases or decreases accurately enough to aid bargaining considerably. 161One of the problems with the use of damages in nuisance cases is accuracy of information. In order to maximize efficiency, the court requires a lot of accurate information. The court needs both a profit and a damage schedule to fix an accurate entitlement point for the defendant and appropriate damages for the plaintiff. Polinsky, Resolving Nuisance Disputes, supra note 158, at 1100-05. Nui sance defendants may be unwilling to give profit information; plaintiffs may inflate damages. There is less of a problem in easement cases because there is only one amount to determine and, while there are always potential problems in the determinations of fair market value, courts have dealt with them satisfactorily for a long time. Too low a compensation figure may allow inefficient uses of land or leave an unfair part of the cost on the servient owner. In probably the larger number of cases, the value to the dominant owner will exceed the damage in any event, and so an inaccurate assessment will not necessarily result in inefficient allocations. Too high a figure will over-compensate the servient owner and may lead to some dislocations in planning by altering the cost of the development (or exploitation) and impairing proper market choices as to use.</page><page sequence="35">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 137 that a result is more likely to be reached. Thus, it is more efficient than the present arrangement. The supervisory or administrative costs of any choice should not be ne glected. The least expensive choice is probably a free rein for the dominant owner. All others place some limit on the use and raise the possibility that the court may have to frame and enforce an injunction if the use is excessive. In addi tion, both the present arrangement and the favored choice create the possibility of a dominant owner again seeking an increased use as conditions change. B. Fairness The adoption of any strict rule of universal application that people know about would be a significant step towards eliminating much unfairness. A domi nant owner with no right to expand because a servient veto exists has no expecta tion interest to protect. Alternatively, a general right of the dominant owner to change and expand use without compensation would eliminate unfairness if ser vient owners knew of the easement and the rule, thus enabling servient owners to properly discount for the easement. Under either choice, a knowing loser has no expectation interest to protect. There is no guarantee, however, that people will know the rule and take the amount of potential loss into account. Of the first two options, the servient veto alternative seems fairer because the loss is usually only of potential, not actual value. But the third choice appears to be the fairest because it offers some protec tion to the probable, reasonable expectations of unknowing parties, though one only by a liability and not by a property rule. The servient owner is compensated for the injury to the land caused by the change/expansion. The profit or advan tage from the use of dominant land goes to the dominant owner. The result under any of the choices clearly is not a random choice and well-informed parties can plan with some confidence in the outcome. C. Utility Neither of the first two solutions is satisfactory from a utilitarian point of view. Although it is possible that the solutions will be economically efficient, each has the potential for producing real demoralization costs to the losing party and no settlement costs. Additionally, in some cases the efficient solution will not be reached. The third proposal produces the best combination of fairness and efficiency, and is preferable to the others even if it does not maximize utility. It offers the disappointed servient owner, who now must accept the change, a settlement of at least the objective costs. Of course, subjective damages cause demoralization, but at least some of the sting may be removed by the partial remedy.162 162This proposal uses an objective measure of damages and forces an agreement as to the scope of the easement (some might see this as a forced transfer/exchange of rights) with a payment for the agreement. In one sense this creates an optimal result since the dominant owner will be better off (assuming that the advantage outweighs the payment and the agreement is made) and the servient owner is no worse off.</page><page sequence="36">138 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 The dominant owner will seek the lowest compensation cost possible. The servient owner may prefer melioration because that will leave more choices of use available to him. Some servient owners may be able to turn a profit by taking damages and meliorating, but that would involve some court costs. There will be some demoralization costs that may not be so fully covered even under this pro posal. Servient owners with subjective damages that exceed objective damages and those with a particular use that the change/expansion now prevents are not going to be fully compensated for their perceived loss.163 But overall the proposal comes closer to reaching a utilitarian result than any other. The three new choices are all more useful than the existing arrangement to the attorney who is advising a client. Each proposal eliminates some of the uncer tainty of the present rule by settling the allocation. Although the value that the other side places on the entitlement is unknown, as is true in almost any negotia tion, at least it can at least be estimated. Under the third test, however, there is the added uncertainty as to the court's evaluation of the parties' own assessments. A lawyer planning a transaction with an easement involved should always be prepared to draw the easement carefully or to suggest agreeing upon a new ease ment. The three proposals do nothing to make that less desirable. The third choice may offer a little more protection to the lawyer who does not act carefully by limiting either a dominant or servient owner's exposure in a loss caused by uncertainty. D. Planning The servient owner's veto option does not necessari ly contribute to a rational system of planning and land use allocation. For one thing it allows the use of easement control as a virtual zoning device. A servient owner with veto power may exercise it to prevent development. A neighbor with no easement may ob ject only on the basis of a potential nuisance. If the land use is otherwise permis sible, it is simply one that the owner must tolerate. If the use is objectionable as a nuisance, there are a variety of solutions available. Allowing this use of ease ments to achieve zoning objectives makes little sense.164 The dominant owner with a free rein is entitled to uses that similarly may misallocate resources or introduce dysfunctions into the planning system. The owner may impose, without cost, important detriments on the servient land and reap the benefits of use without paying for them. The system of land use in the United States strongly adopts the principle that those who create negative im pacts should bear their cost.165 163Some protection is available for subjective damages because the servient owner may, as in any case, reacquire the easement or purchase a limitation of it. This will likely not happen often since the advantage that expansion confers on the dominant land will usually exceed even the highest amount of subjective damages. 164Soltis v. Miller, 444 Pa. 357, 282 A.2d 369 (1971) (recognizing the error of using easements to "zone" land uses). 165Note, Internalizing Externalities: Nuisance Law and Economic Efficiency, 53 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 219(1978).</page><page sequence="37">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 139 The third proposal avoids both of these results. The dominant owner is not free simply to impose on another parcel and avoid all of the costs. The costs re lated to the easement use will be paid to the person who suffers them. On the other hand, the role of adjusting competing possessory interests is properly left within the sphere of nuisance, covenant, and zoning law. The law of affirmative easements that concerns the adjustments of rights in the same parcel of land is left in its appropriate area. There is neither an unpaid-for benefit nor an extortion that potentially warps the normal market process. E. Neighborliness Any arrangement of easement law necessarily works best when neighbors adjust their interests and cooperate to avoid conflict. Bright line allocations, com bined with injunctive relief when the servient owner prevails, create a system with little or no incentive for cooperation or communication. There is no incen tive to engage in melioration under the present system or under the first two pro posals. When the dominant owner has potential liability in damages to the servient owner, there is a new opening for cooperation. The dominant owner is inter ested in a settlement and in lowering any payments. The servient owner might be concerned only with maximizing the compensation, but this presumes that com pensation is, in fact, a good replacement for the lost value. Ifit is, then the servient owner will seek maximum compensation. But a servient owner, truly interested in preserving potential and existing uses of property in the face of the easement expansion, may find meliorating measures at least as appealing as compensation. The third proposal is clearly the most likely to bring the parties into a cooper ative arrangement that will lessen the effect of the change/expansion on the ser vient tenement. Even the servient owner who would like to restrict the change as a way of avoiding any nuisance effect will have to recognize the advantage in compromising on the easement and attacking the nuisance effect on its own mer its. Perhaps compensation will have a positive effect on a spiteful owner. IV. Clarifications and Objections While no ideal arrangement for resolving change/expansion cases exists, the third proposal?compensated expansion?appears to be the best solution. But before this approach can be adopted, it must be clarified to deal with certain ob jections. A. Clarifications 1. When Is an Easement Uncertain? When Is a Change Clearly Impermissible? One objection to the old arrangement is its softness. The terms "uncertain" and "clearly impermissible" need to be defined so that they can be easily under stood by everyone. "Uncertain" is not hard to define. All unwritten easements are by definition</page><page sequence="38">140 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 uncertain. Written easements that do not specifically address the issue of uncer tainty are likewise uncertain. "Clearly impermissible" is a little harder to define. Currently, courts examine the circumstances of the creation of an easement, and a variety of other factors, to determine the permissibility of change/expansion. There is a simpler test: An easement change is impermissible when no rea sonable person would view the change/expansion as being within the scope of the easement under present circumstances. A consideration under this test is the payment of compensation. The idea is to protect reasonable expectations on both sides. If no reasonable person would see the change as permissible, then the dominant owner can have no expectation that requires protection and the ser vient owner would not have taken the easement into account in the transaction acquiring the land or giving up the easement. 2. When Is a Change/Expansion "Development-Driven"? In most cases the dominant owner will be motivated by the need to make changes that arise out of changes in the area, land, or technology. Thus, the pre sumption will be that changes are development-driven.166 Lack of need for the expansion based on reasonable requirements of the dominant estate in relation to changes, or reasonable needs generally, will be a defense available to the ser vient owner rather than an element of the dominant owner's case. The expansion will usually entail two costs: the physical costs involved with the expansion and the costs of compensating the servient owner or meliorating the damage. A domi nant owner will be unlikely to engage in expansion out of spite. Thus, the burden of raising this defense ought to be on the servient owner.167 3. How Long Will the Determination Last? A problem with some easement and servitude termination cases is that the decision depends on the circumstances that exist at the time of the decision. Of course, circumstances can change168 and time can create problems with the pro posal as well. Suppose that in 1989 the court determines that the compensation due to the servient owner is $10,000. If the value of the change to the dominant owner is only $9,000, the dominant owner will refuse to pay and will not ex 166Legislation has been adopted in some states to protect farms from the application of nuisance and other rules which seem to encourage development. Hand, Right to Farm Laws: Breaking New Ground in the Preservation of Farm Land, 45 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 289 (1984). Where adopted, this policy probably should be applied to change/expansion issues. 167The assumption for favoring the protection of the dominant owner by allowing an expansion of use that is development-driven is that the basic force behind the change (that is, the development) is a market force. In the long run those development-driven expansions that add more value to the domi nant property than the decrease in value to the servient property are efficient. This excludes the nui sance factor that must be dealt with separately. 168One distinction between easements and servitudes has been that the passage of time and changes of circumstances can lead to the termination of servitudes; there must be something more for the termination of easements. See Note, Termination of Servitudes: Expanding the Remedies for "Changed Conditions", 31 UCLA L. Rev. 226 (1983), on servitudes and Cunningham, Property ? 8.12, on easements. But it is possible development-driven changes may cause a need for additional expansion. If so, additional compensation would have to be paid for any additional injury.</page><page sequence="39">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 141 pand. But suppose that by 1992 the change is worth $15,000 to the dominant owner. Is the servient owner bound by the 1989 compensation figure that may no longer be adequate because of inflation or other changes? A new assessment of compensation might exceed $16,000. There seems to be no good answer. Establishing a hard and fast rule may create large inequities when rapid growth or high inflation give an advantage to dominant owners who choose to wait. On the other hand, simply leaving the case in abeyance creates the poten tial of periodic litigation with all its inherent costs. One suggestion is that the court retain jurisdiction and provide, as a general rule, for an annual increase in the amount in accordance with a publicly established scale (e.g., cost of living index), but allow a motion to establish a different value. After seven years (a sab batical) the cause of action will be dismissed and any new proposal will require a new case. 4. Does the Proposal Allow Other Compensated Changes in Scope? Other disputes between dominant and servient owners may seem appropri ate for the proposal in some modified version. A dominant owner might seek to extend the use to nonappurtenant land; a servient owner might seek to have the easement either physically relocated, or terminated entirely; or a servient owner might seek to remove the uncertainty by rewriting the easement and limiting its expansibility. Any of these disputes can be solved by agreement between the parties. But if agreement cannot be reached, should courts be willing to grant the change sought upon payment of compensation? Unlike the change/expansion problem, some of these disputes are subject to easily applied rules. Courts consistently have rejected both the extension of ease ments to nonappurtenant land169 and the termination of easements simply upon payment of damages or loss.170 Some courts have allowed the relocation of ease ments if there would be an advantage to the servient land and if there was no interference with the essential use of the easement.171 No cases dealing with what might be referred to as buy-down rather than buy-out of the easements have been found, but the result for most courts would clearly be the same.172 Given the certainty of the rules concerning extensions to nonappurtenant land and removal of easements, parties, unless motivated by spite or other prob lems, can reach efficient solutions. There is, of course, still the possibility of stra tegic bargaining preventing agreement. 169Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash. 2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986); Soergel v. Preston, 141 Mich.

App. 1984) (buy-down reduction of the burden not allowed where cross-agreements might have been either easements or covenants).</page><page sequence="40">142 25 REAL PROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 103 If the courts adopt the suggestion of expansion and change with compensa tion, do notions of reciprocity and symmetry require the adoption of similar rules for buy-down, buy-out, and extensions to nondominant land? A buy-out of easements is simply too great an interference with private prop erty rights. Compensated expansion is based on the assumption that the extent of the rights and the balancing of the reasonable expectations on both sides are un certain.173 When the easement unquestionably exists, there can be no expecta tion by the servient owner that there is no easement.174 The servient owner can simply negotiate a release of the easement. The market provides a solution for the buy-out problem and sufficient certainty on the issue exists to prevent much stra tegic bargaining. A buy-down can also be obtained with a release and then the grant of a new, clearly limited easement. The current rule on extension to nondominant land should also stand. Again, a certain expectation can be protected. The dominant owner ought not to have an expectation beyond the appurtenant land; the servient owner ought to have no fear of change beyond original land. 5. Does the Proposal Reach Easements in Gross and Negative Easements? There is no reason not to apply the proposed arrangement to easements in gross. Commercial easements in gross are often more specifically written so there may be fewer cases. Technological developments, rather than land use changes, will usually drive increases easements in gross. Personal easements in gross may change or expand, but the limits on transferability and divisibility that exist will prevent many questions from arising.175 There seems to be, at best, a limited role for the proposal in dealing with negative easements. It is hard to imagine many questions of scope in dealing with them. An easement for light and air is simply that. More modern negative ease ments, such as solar easements, call for so detailed a description of the easement that there will be no expansion issue.176 Some negative easements, such as an easement not to sue for the use that the dominant owner makes of the land to permit a nuisance, may be capable of expansion. A change of the dominant land use might have more impact. If the court decides that the easement itself is not so 173This may seem to be drawing a fine line by saying, on the one hand, that allowing the dominant owner to make an uncertain use and compensate the servient owner, simply gives effect to both par ties' rights and expectations and there is no taking involved. On the other hand, suggesting that a rule allowing the servient owner to buy out the entire easement involves the taking of a right. But it ap pears that the matter does admit of that definition. The dominant owner does have a right to make some uses of the servient land and that right should change hands only in the market place. It has a clear existence even though admittedly at its margin it runs into and overlaps the rights of the servient owner to make use of his property. 174A few hidden easements may survive both notice and recording.

Rev. 1 (1987). 175Cunningham, Property ?? 8.10-8.11 (discussion of the transferability and disability of per sonal easements in gross). 176See, e.g., Wash. Rev. Code. Ann. ? 64.04.140 to -170 (1988).</page><page sequence="41">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 143 explicit as to authorize all changes, or this particular change, the proposal could play some role.177 B. Objections 1. There Is No Real Need to Change the Present Arrangement Most cases involving significant change or great damage will be handled through negotiation. Often only neighborhood spats wind up in court with the dispute unresolved. The people with the most at stake reach an efficient solution. Smaller disputes are more likely to involve personalities than the efficient use of property. For these, the present system works as well as any.178 Though the reported decisions reveal a significant number of apparently in significant cases, in many cases expansion of the easement is important to the development of a large parcel of property.179 Because most of the reported cases are appellate decisions, it is impossible to determine how many suits are settled after an initial judicial decision allocated the rights of the parties. Even if pre-litigation or appeal settlement resolves most cases, adopting the proposal will give a clearer background for successful negotiation. The proposal sets forth the rights of the parties without the hedge of uncertainty and largely eliminates the problem of bilateral monopoly that inhibits effective negotiation. Currently, strategic bargaining may consume assets better used in the develop ment itself.180 The bargaining may block appropriate development, at least in the short run. Even when the stakes are relatively small and personal conflicts, rather than the use, fuel the dispute, the change will have a salutary effect. Lawyers can ad vise parties with considerably more certainty and perhaps avoid disputes. The certainty of result may preclude "last-ditchism" by either owner. The fact of com pensation may convince at least some reluctant servient owners that compromise is the best policy. Thus, change is needed for both large and small disputes. Whether the fric 177At this point the problem develops into a nuisance case as opposed to an easement case. The new use is not covered by the old easement, and, thus, the case should be treated as a nuisance. The distinction between a negative easement and a running covenant, or equitable restriction not to sue, also becomes a very fine one. It is an interpretation problem with a covenant or servitude and a scope problem with an easement. The compensated change/expansion appears to be the best remedy re gardless of the initial characterization. 178?ut see Epstein, Nuisance Law: Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 J. Legal Stud. 49 (1979) (noting the societal cost of applying "modern" nuisance law to small cases). 179See Aztec Ltd., Inc. v. Creekside Inv. Co., 100 Idaho 566, 602 P.2d 64 (1979) (limitation on prescriptive easement inhibited development of large apartment complex with no demonstrated proof of actual damage to the servient property). 180Merrill, Review Essay on Epstein's Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Do main, 80 Nw.

The Proposal Takes Private Property There is no taking in the constitutional sense under this proposal. The pro posed arrangement is simply a method of resolving disputes between owners of property interests. It is different from the current arrangement only in the way the dispute is resolved. Under the current arrangement, no taking occurs even though the court's determination may have a substantial impact on property val ues.181 The application of the doctrines of prescription and adverse possession may result in a court ordered or recognized transfer of property, but this result has never been regarded as a taking.182 The application of the relative hardship doc trine in nuisance cases, substituting compensatory for injunctive relief, arguably creates a right of private condemnation in the injured party.183 In an admitted nui sance case, an invasion of the plaintiff's rights occurs. In the expansion case, each party has a right and the adjustment of that right is the issue. A more troublesome objection is the philosophical one. Professor Epstein strenuously urges that the full protection of property rights, once identified, is a principle of fundamental justice. Utilitarian constraints sometimes overcome this principle, but generally, landowners should not be forced to surrender to the community need without a constitutionally appropriate, compensated taking. The solitary holdout in covenant or nuisance cases is a strength of the present system, not a problem.184 Compensated expansion deprives potentially victori ous servient owners of the right to hold out and protect their property as they see fit. They could either prevent the increased use or obtain their own valuation of the diminution of their interest. Is this different from the problem Professor Epstein identifies? An entitlement is not being allocated. Each party clearly has an entitlement, but its extent is un certain. Rather, a choice is being made among a number of permissible uses and an attempt is being made to adjust the rights and expectations of the parties by giving each some protection. The proposal recognizes the overlapping uses and protects both owners. The dominant owner's expectation of reasonable use is recognized by allowing the change/expansion; the servient owner's expectation 1815ee Magna, Inc. v. Catranis, 512 So. 2d 912 (Ala. 1987) (dominant owner's parking and ingress and egress easement precluded any use by servient owner even though dominant owner did not pres ently need to use the area in question). 182Warsaw v.

Rev. 1353, 1367 (1982); Epstein, Nuisance Law: Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 j. Legal Stud. 49(1979).</page><page sequence="43">SPRING 1990 Easements Are Nuisances 145 of reasonable use is protected by compensation for interference with that use.185 3. The Proposal Favors Expansion and Is, Therefore, Pro-development By protecting the dominant owner's expectation with an entitlement and the servient owner's expectation with compensation, the proposal favors the domi nant owner and expansion. The presumption that expansion is development driven is an additional pro-development factor. A rule might have been chosen that would not allow expansion but would compensate the dominant owner for the loss occasioned by non-expansion. There are a number of reasons for rejecting this idea. One is practical: if the domi nant owner has a development-driven need for expansion, her wealth will in crease. The change will produce some income. The dominant owner will have a source out of which to make the compensation. The same cannot be said of the servient owner who, in order to make the payment, might have to liquidate the very asset that the owner is trying to protect. The more basic reason for rejecting such a rule is a preference for orderly growth regulated by appropriate individual controls, public land use controls, and the market. The use of easements and an ability of the servient owner to control uses by the buy-down of easements would interfere with this and, in the long run, lead to inefficiency in land use choices. 4. The Proposal Increases Existing Unfairness to Prescriptive Servient Owners Assuming there is unfairness involved in the creation of prescriptive ease ments,186 this proposal alleviates rather than increases any unfairness. Even the most stringent rules concerning prescription allow some change in the ease ments. The originally prescribed owner never received any compensation for the original easement; any increase in scope cannot be justified on the notion that it is allowable because the owner already has discounted for it. The new rule al lows some compensation for the additional injury that may occur to the servient land by the change/expansion. The dominant owner, who has made no actual expenditure on the strength of the existing easement, now at least has to make some payment for the right that is asserted. Rather than being unfair in any way, this proposal in fact increases the fairness to servient owners. 185This description is clearly open to criticism. "To allow a defendant to seize the property of another for a mere price of court damages violates the justice notion that property should change hands only through voluntary exchanges."
