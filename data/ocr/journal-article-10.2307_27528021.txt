<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEWANEE REVIEW. A Quarterly Journal of Literary Studies. Vol. VIL] JANUARY, 1899. [No. 1. THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELIGIONS: ITS PITFALLS AND ITS PROMISE. Incidental to recent scientific progress in every depart ment of research and investigation, the comparative method of study has received general recognition. It dominates the entire field of biology, and through the spectroscope its " Eye dismounts the highest star," as it reaches out into the realms of physics and astronomy. It traces the relations of the human anatomy to that of the lower forms of animal life, thereby affording abundant evi dence of the reasonableness of the doctrine of evolution, and of our far-away kinship with the brute creation. It enters the realm of psychology, and throws valuable light on the nether side of human experience by tracing the heritage of morbid tendencies and criminal impulses to that animal an cestry out of which man has slowly risen. By showing the relationships of mental processes in men and animals it dem onstrates the unity of mind. The sciences of comparative anatomy and comparative psychology have now taken a per manent place in the curriculum of the college and the uni versity. The command, u Know thyself," is scientifically understood to imply the sympathetic study of our poor rela tions, the lower forms of sentient life. Not only is the comparative method potent in revealing the true nature of the human mind; it is also of the highest util ity in studying the special and particular activities of men in the living world of society. We have learned that man is</page><page sequence="2">The Sezvanee Review. primarily and essentially a social being. His vision of the world that now is, and his hopes of the world to come, grow out of his social relationships. The " lone anthropoid" of earlier evolutionary speculation was a fiction of the unin structed scientific imagination. Man never was an unsocial being. We can only know the individual by comprehend ing his relations with his fellows. Separate him from his fellows, and he is no longer an individual: he becomes an insentient thing, a lump of clay. To know him truly, we must study him, not only in his static relations with the ex isting generation of living men and women, but also in his dynamic relations, as the inheritor of impulses, ideas, and tendencies received from past generations. We cannot know the man of to-day without knowing something of our Father Man, the Man who was the life of history. What is true of the individual is true also of those instincts, faculties, and tendencies which groups of men hold in com mon : it is true of the growing sciences based on the study of these instincts, faculties, and tendencies?of ethics, so ciology, and religion?as well as of language, the medium of social intercommunication. The science of comparative philology has been especially fruitful in the light which it throws upon the natural history of the human intellect, as well as upon those social and political relationships which are usually grouped under the head of history. Like sociology itself, the science of religion, based upon the comparative study of early and contemporaneous forms of religious belief, is still in its infancy?a science in the making?but already full of promise and hope for man. It is a science the materials for which have mainly been gath ered during the past century, the possibility and opportunity for which have only recently dawned upon the human mind. Its full revelations are for the generations yet to be. Won derful indeed, and full of deep significance already, are the results of the comparative study of religions, in their bearing not only on our understanding of the nature of religion but on our comprehension of that form of religious faith which is our own inheritance. We are beginning to realize the</page><page sequence="3">Comparative Study of Religions. 3 full import of the statement of the venerable pioneer in com parative study, both in philology and in religion, Professor F. Max M?ller, of Oxford University, who quotes Goethe's paradox, " He who knows one language knows none," and declares that it is equally true that he who knows one reli gion knows none. Marvelous beyond all anticipation have been the labors of investigators in this field of study, wonderful are the results of their faithful research during the century which is now closing. Buried cities have been resurrected; languages, dead so many centuries that their alphabets, grammars, and relationships to other tongues were lost and forgotten, have been brought to light and reconstructed; inscriptions and manuscripts in the ancient Sanskrit, Pahlavi, Pali, Avestan, Chinese, Egyptian, Semitic dialects, and Chaldean tongues, have been patiently studied and triumphantly rendered, until we are now able to trace dimly the features of ancient cults and the character of their social and intellectual environ ments, out of the interaction between which have been evolved the faiths, rituals, and dogmas that the world holds dear to-day. There are two essential qualifications for comparative study in every department of research, and especially in the inves tigation of religions: an open mind, free from the bias of preconceptions, searching for ideal truth, and ready to ac cept truth wherever it maybe found; and a sound judgment ?the capacity for weighing evidence and giving to every fact its due force in the formation of conclusions. The stu dent should also be well grounded in the scientific method, particularly in psychology. Without these qualifications the investigator is likely to be led astray at every step. With them, he is sure to enlarge the boundaries of his own knowl edge, and his judgment will become a safe reliance for other students and investigators. Dogmatism is out of place in scientific research, whatever may be its subject-matter. It is peculiarly out of place in the historical and comparative study of religions. When the late George Smith, of the British Museum,</page><page sequence="4">4 The Sezvanee Review. translated the remarkable series of cuneiform tablets con taining the Chaldean stories of the creation and the flood, he thought he discovered in a fragmentary inscription of Nebudchadnezzar's 1 a reference to the scriptural account of the Tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues.2 He translated a portion of this inscription as follows : The tower, the eternal house which I founded and built, The first story, which is the base of the house, The most ancient monument of Babylon, I built and finished it. .This edifice, The house of the seven lights of the earth, The most ancient monument of Borsippa: A former king built it, forty-two ages ago, But he did not complete its head. Since a remote time people had abandoned it, Without order expressing their words. . . . In these last lines Mr. Smith discovered, as he thought, an allusion to the Bible story of the confusion of tongues. This theory was dissipated, however, when Mr. FoxTalbot, an equally conscientious and reliable student and translator, rendered the italicized lines : From extreme old age it had rotted away. The water springs beneath it had not been kept in order. Dr. Sayce and other subsequent investigators corroborated the conclusion of Mr. Talbot that nothing like the interpre tation assigned to the passage by Mr. Smith can legitimately be given to it. No one suspects that Mr. Smith deliberately falsified the record; but, carried away by his preconception, and self-hypnotized into a state of mental expectancy, he read into the inscription the interpretation which he antici pated finding there. This illustrates the extreme care which is necessary, even for the most competent investigator, to assure entire openness of mind and freedom from bias in his studies. On the other hand, there are enthusiastic archaeologists 1Nabu-Kur-ud-uzer of the inscriptions. 2Vide "The Chaldean Account of Genesis."</page><page sequence="5">Comparative Study of Religions. 5 and travelers, like Dr. LePlongeon1 and his excellent wife, entirely reliable, doubtless, as witnesses to any facts they may describe, but whose interpretation of these facts is vitiated by the lack of a sufficient basis in sound scholarship outside their specialty, and by the possession of an untrained judgment in the methods of scientific procedure. When Dr. LePlongeon, for example, finds evidences of lingual kinship and the transference of religious ideas in languages so di verse as the Maya and earlier Central American dialects, the Egyptian, Chaldean, Aramaic, and Sanskrit, and gives to the dying words of the Christ, as reported in Mark in the Aramaic tongue, a Maya significance quite different from that assigned to them by the Evangelist, he discredits the soundness of all his conclusions in the judgment of compe tent scholars. The student of comparative religion has also to guard most carefully against the tendency to assume a common origin for myths and religious ideas because of their evident similarity among different peoples. He needs to be well grounded in psychology, as well as in the ordinary modes of scientific procedure. He must remember that science teaches the unity of mind, and that the minds of men react naturally in a similar way, in response to like phenomena, the world over. As an able writer has recently said, fifi Myths bloom as freely in the human mind as blossoms on the trees."2 In order to infer logically the transference of religious ideas from one people or cult to another, a historical contact must be clearly proven, and it must also be plainly shown that the idea in question was not held by the people or cult to whom it is assumed that it was transferred prior to the contact, and that evidences of its growth in the new soil are subsequently discernible. The effort which has been made in recent years, for ex author of "The Ancient Inhabitants of Peru, and Their Civilization," "Vestiges of the Mayas," "Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and the Quiches," etc. 2 Count Goblet d'Alviella, " Origin and Growth of the Conception of God" (Hibbert Lectures).</page><page sequence="6">6 The Sewanee Review. ample, to trace primitive Christian ideas and ceremonials to a Buddhist origin1 is discredited at the outset by the totally different conceptions of the God idea and the destiny of man after death in the two religions. The evidence of historical contacts must be very clear indeed to permit a logical infer ence of assimilation to account for superficial likenesses. The fact that both Buddha and Jesus taught in parables, and that there are certain undeniable resemblances in their ethical doctrines, by no means justifies the assumption that the latter Teacher consciously or unconsciously borrowed from Buddhistic sources; nor does the evidence that Bud dhist missionaries were teaching in various parts of Asia, and even, possibly, on the confines of Europe, in pre-Chris tian times, furnish a sufficient proof of a historical contact between the two religions. On the other hand, the admitted indebtedness of the Roman Church to paganism for some of its paraphernalia and ceremonial observances,2 and the marked similarity between the Buddhist and Roman rituals, justify the reasonable inference that both may have uncon sciously drawn from common antecedent sources in creating these externals of their respective cults. The best corrective of such assumptions as those to which reference has been made, as to Buddhist influence on the essentials of Christian doctrine, is to be found not in ridicule or denunciation, but in studying such able and scholarly treatises as Professor Crawford Howell Toy's " Quotations of the Old Testament in the New," a noble contribution to the science of compar ative religion. The careful study of such works as this, and a thorough knowledge of the characteristics of Hebrew thought prior to the advent of Christianity, would prevent hasty inferences like those in Dr. Felix Oswald's " Secret of the East," and the recent works of Dr. Paul Cams.3 In addition to such honest, and in some respects scholarly efforts as these, which err in their conclusions through a lack of adequate preparation along certain related lines of study i Cf. " The Secret of the East," by Felix Oswald, M.D. 2 Vide " Christian Institutions," by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. s "The Gospel of Buddha" and " Buddhism and Its Christian Critics."</page><page sequence="7">Comparative Study of Religions. 7 on the part of their authors, the science of comparative reli gion is also unjustly compelled to bear the burden of such publications as the works of the late Madame Blavatsky, Professor Piazzi Smith, and other writers who have endeav ored to prove the inspired and prophetic character of the structure of the Great Pyramid; and the anonymous author of the bulky quarto entitled " Bible Myths and Their Paral lels in Other Religions." Here the theological, or antitheo logical, bias is dominant, and the author is enabled to read into a mass of poorly digested and badly arranged material, including a good deal which is of questionable authenticity, the special theory which he subsequently triumphantly draws out of it. To the trained mind of the scholarly investigator these works pass for their true value, but to the general reader whose curiosity is sufficiently piqued to induce him to wade through their pages they are inevitably confusing and misleading. These, however, are the mere flotsam and jet sam of the great current of historical investigation which is bearing us on toward undiscovered continents of truth and scholarly acquirement. Having noted some of the danger signals that must be set up along the path of the student in comparative religion, it is the further purpose of this article to indicate a few of the in teresting results of this study as it relates to the origin and early manifestations of the religious sentiment. One of the most difficult things for a person to do, as all experience tes tifies, is to put himself in another's place, and look upon the problems of life with the eyes of those whose bias of inher itance and education is different from his own. Yet this is what we must all attempt to do if we would live in just and friendly relations with our fellows. It is, in fact, a univer sally recognized obligation of Christian ethics embodied in the golden rule. If it admittedly applies to the ordinary affairs of life, it is equally essential in what we may term the ethics of the intellect. In religious investigation this obliga tion upon the scholar is incessant and peremptory. Espe cially where the time element affects the problem the diffi culty of forming just conclusions is greatly increased. * We</page><page sequence="8">8 The Sew anee Review. are accustomed to look upon religion as a thing which sprang, Minervalike, full panoplied, from the brain of Jove?a thing for all time, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever. We are beginning to see, however, that a golden thread of unity and progressive tendency runs through the entire period of man's social and religious development; to discover an ele ment of truth and reality even in the most primitive faiths ; and to realize that the highest conceptions of the most ad vanced religions have roots running back into the prehistoric period. Primitive man, as revealed by ethnological and anthropo logical studies, must have been a being of exceedingly sim ple habits, characteristics, and ideas, a child of nature rather than of art or culture. We must get very near to nature in its original simplicity before we can understand him, enter into his joys, comprehend his sorrows, or think his thoughts after him. Seeking for the origin and earliest characteristics of his religious ideas, we find them, apparently, in psychical activities which he possessed in common with the higher ani mals. Whether all aboriginal peoples have had some form of religion is still a disputed question. Philologists tell us that there are extant savage tribes which have no words to express the ideas of God, spirit, or a life apart from that of the physical body. The testimony of language, however, is inconclusive, since among primitive peoples languages un dergo very rapid changes. Words and even ideas may have been lost as a result of changing social conditions and envi ronments. The doctrine of evolution implies possible local degeneration, as well as general progress; and some savage tribes are doubtless degenerate survivors of an earlier stock. However we may decide the problem of the universality of the religious sentiment within the range of the historical period, we must regard it as antecedently probable that there existed a prehistoric stage in human evolution, when no con ceptions were held that we ought strictly to designate as re ligious. In common with the higher animals, however, primi tive man exemplified the tendency to regard all moving ob jects, whether natural or artificial, as alive, endowed with</page><page sequence="9">Comparative Study of Religions. 9 volition, and capable of inflicting injury or bestowing bene fits on men. All children, as well as undeveloped adult races and individuals, still manifest the tendency to interpret all unexplained phenomena involving the expression of force or motion in the terms of their own consciousness. They per sonifjr these phenomena, attribute to them certain beneficent or maleficent purposes and powers, and fear and blame them for injuries inflicted, as they would human beings. A cat or dog will jump at bits of paper or small objects blown by the wind as upon living game. The horse "shies" at an object of unusual appearance, thinking it is some living be ing which bodes him harm. Animals, like human beings, learn to trace the movements of accustomed objects to their natural causes, and cease to regard them with apprehension. It is the element of mystery behind the phenomenon, the apparently self-moving activity, akin to that inner sense of freedom or volition which he experiences in his own con sciousness that leads the man or animal to personify the mov ing or mysterious object, and causes it to be regarded with fear or dread. This impulse, in its most primitive form, cannot properly be characterized as religious. It is, however, the psycho logical substratum out of which the religious sentiment is de veloped. It becomes religious only when a sense of depend ence upon this external power for help and sustenance, or even for life itself, accompanies its personification. In this primitive notion, the result of early introspection and reflec tion, are the seeds of both theism and pantheism. It devel ops as naturally into the sense of oneness with the divine which finds its loftiest expression in noble philosophical sys tems like the Indian Vedanta, as it does on the other hand into the sense of God as an overruling power, outside of man and the physical universe. It is to this same concep tion of force as a psychical perception in the individual con sciousness that Herbert Spencer traces all our ideas of those natural forces which we objectify in the material universe. The so-called physical energies which hold the planets in their orbits and bind together the atoms in a block of granite</page><page sequence="10">IO The Sew anee Review. are, in his philosophy, only known to us through a psychical experience ; and this experience constitutes the most ultimate of all our philosophical ideas. One of the most characteristic and universal among the earlier forms of religious expression is that known as fetich ism, which is directly allied to the primitive conception al ready described. Fetichism is defined by Count Goblet d'Alviella, in his Hibbert Lectures on "The Origin and Growth of the Idea of God," as " the belief in supernatural influences emanating from concrete objects." 4i The whole meaning of fetichism," he adds, " may be defined as the be lief that the appropriation of a thing may secure the services of the spirit which lodges within it." Strictly speaking, however, the conception of a spirit as lodging within the ob ject and separable from it characterizes a more advanced re ligious and psychological stage in human evolution, which is better designated as animism. The fetich worshiper re gards the object itself as alive?he has not yet formed a clear conception of an indwelling spirit separable from the material form. It is the thing itself, regarded as endowed with life and possessing supernatural powers, which is the object of his reverence. It is not the purpose of this paper to describe in detail the various phases of fetich worship, or of the other early forms in which the religious sentiment manifests itself. Students have divided fetichism into two modes or forms, the natural and artificial, or the primary and secondary. In the first, man personifies natural objects?a rude stone, a tree, or per haps an animal supposed to possess supernatural powers? and chooses them for his helpers. The second and more advanced form, which should be clearly distinguished by a separate designation, and which has been called animism, implies the assumed incorporation of an independent spirit into the material object. There is much confusion among writers in the use of these terms, but a proper respect for the philology of the term "animism" would justify the distinc tion herein indicated, and simplify future expositions of the subject. In no case, it should be clearly understood, does</page><page sequence="11">Comparative Study of Religions. il the fetich worshiper bow down to the simple stock or stone which he chooses as the object of his devotions. It is always the life supposed to dwell within the object, the powrer not himself and assumed to be superior to himself, which the fetich symbolizes to his imagination, that is the real object of his reverence. The supposed efficacy of relics, like the teeth of Buddha, the bones of the saints, and nails from the true cross, is a survival of the fetichistic cult which persists under the sanc tion of some of the more advanced forms of religion at the present day. Underlying this superstition is a really noble idea: the conception that human virtue is undying, that it lends power and blessings to all it touches, that contact with a righteous personality is an imperishable honor to the body which was its habitation or the cross on which the Saviour of the race was nailed. Perhaps the noblest development of fetichism is where it passes into Sabianism, or the worship of the heavenly bodies. This mode of worship was dominant in the religions of an cient Chaldea, Babylonia, Assyria, and Phoenicia, and strongly influenced all the older forms of religion among the Semites and other Oriental peoples. Survivals of this, as well as of more degraded forms, are to be found even now in popular superstitions almost world-wide in their influence. The notion of good luck, as related to the possession of such objects as the horseshoe and the four-leaved clover, or to the accident of seeing the new moon over the right shoulder; the conception that bad luck follows the accidental spilling of salt, or breaking of glass, or the dropping of a fork if it happens to stick upright in the floor, are familiar illustrations of influences from which many otherwise rational and intel ligent people are not wholly free. Fetichism easily passes over into divination, survivals of which still exist in the cus tom of " telling fortunes " by inspecting the grounds in a tea cup, and similar pastimes of the thoughtless and supersti tious. If we were to stop short with illustrations of this kind, the study of primitive religious ideas might seem to demonstrate</page><page sequence="12">12 The Sewanee Review. what the scientific mind would regard as a sympathy and persistence of superstitions rather than the unity of the reli gious sentiment. Probing beneath these surface manifesta tions, the scientific student of religions finds that fetichism was not only in the normal line of religious evolution, but that it even illustrates the childlike effort of the human mind toward a scientific explanation of natural phenomena. The fetich worshiper had already passed beyond the stage of simple, unreflecting acceptance of the sense perceptions ex cited by contact with the world about him. He saw in na ture somewhat more than that which superficially appears in its phenomena. The principle of causation had already found a lodgment in his mind, and he had begun to seek for the inner meaning and true cause of the phenomena which he beheld. He sought, as d'Alviella declares, " to appro priate a natural object in order to secure the services of the spirit or power which was lodged within it." What more, in truth, do the apostle of science and the man of affairs seek to accomplish at the present day? In study ing the laws of nature and discovering the properties of mat ter, with added intelligence and in accordance with a truer method?the educational products of past experiences?they strive none the less earnestly " to secure the services of the spirit which is lodged within it." The thought of the scien tific investigator, indeed, is more closely allied to the prim itive fetichistic beliefs of his far-away ancestors than to the later animistic notions which to a great degree have super seded them ; for, like the fetich worshiper, he looks for forces and qualities resident in the objects of his investigation, rather than for ghosts or spirits separable from their material envi ronments. Fetichism allies itself also to some of the noblest forms of religious belief and philosophical speculation that consti tute the world's later heritage. In this earliest form of reli gion we find a very clear appreciation of a spiritual reality, immanent in the world of matter, and transcending sense perception?a higher, more rational, and more monistic con ception of which is the latest outcome of the advanced seien</page><page sequence="13">Comparative Study of Religions. 13 tifie and philosophic thought of the present day. The wor shiper of a transcendent life and power in stocks and stones, in mountains and seas, in the rolling planets, in the storm cloud and the setting sun, was on his way toward the con ception of the deepest spiritual realities?of the immanent and everlasting God. Not less interesting and significant is the revelation of con parative study as to the true psychological and spiritual mean ing of the next stage in religious evolution, which we call idolatry. If we accept the teachings of modern science, we must recognize the fact that our lives are spent in a universe which is known to us only through processes of symbolical representation. This is the truth that all our modern ideal ism somewhat vaguely hints at, and which is most clearly enunciated by Kant and Spencer. It is the essence of the Spencerian doctrine of the relativity of knowledge, and ultimates in the conception of "transfigured realism," which is fundamental to Mr. Spencer's epistemology. Science teaches us, in substance, that our senses are affected in certain specific ways by the activities of an external uni verse. They report these experiences, not in terms of the external operating forces, but of our own consciousness, under the subjective limitations of our senses. Certain at mospheric vibrations give rise in our consciousness to the phenomena of sound. The relation of the mental concept, sound, to a rapid vibration of material particles is something that we cannot understand or explain ; we can only accept it as an ultimate fact. Within a certain definite and measura ble range, the vibrations of a hypothetical but ve^ real medium known as the ether produce in our consciousness the varied phenomena of vision. The wonderful universe of light and shade, of color, perspective and form, is within our own minds; yet we logically relate it to somewhat with out ourselves, which is potent to produce within us the ef fects which wre experience. So of all the other modes of sense perception. Viewing the matter comparatively, we are compelled to the conclusion that, to beings otherwise constituted, the uni</page><page sequence="14">H The Sew anee Review. verse would present an appearance quite different from that which our senses report. The vague consciousness of the microorganism, possessing no developed senses, could not perceive anything like the world of sound and color, taste, smell, and feeling, which is present to us. To Vol taire's imaginary being with seventy senses, what a differ ent world were possible ! a world transcending that in which we live perhaps as much as ours transcends that of the am ba. Every finite being is a creature with an arbitrarily limited number of sense avenues, each of which is also lim ited in its scope or range. To know reality, in its inmost essence, in the totality of its interrelational activities, we must abolish all these limitations, we must become pure spirit, we must become gods. So, too, in our world of social intercommunication, phi lology assures us that we can interchange thought only by the use of verbal symbols. Language can never adequately and completely express the ideas and emotions of the speaker or writer. The hearer participates in the thought of the speaker in proportion to the exactness with which his pre vious experience and reflection have run parallel with those of the speaker, and as his words accordingly give rise to like conceptions in the hearer's mind to those in his own which prompt their expression. The myth arises naturally in uncultivated minds out of this symbology of language, and mythology constitutes an important factor in the study of primitive religions. All communication of truth, therefore, is revelation by the use of symbols ; and all revelation, whether from man to man, or from the infinite Source of all life and truth to the finite mind, depends for its reception and comprehension not only, as Shakspere says of a jest's prosperity, "on the ear of him who hears it," but also on the quality and content of the mind which lies back of the ear and interprets in its own terms the symbols of spoken or written speech. To a man living in such a universe of symbols, how natural is all reli gious symbolism ! how inevitable is that stage in religious evolution which we call "idolatry!" Idolatry indicates an</page><page sequence="15">Comparative Study of Religions. 15 intellectual advance in the manifestation of the religious sentiment, as compared with the mental attitude of the fetich worshiper. It also presupposes the secondary stage which has been denominated " animism." In its earlier and more primitive forms it grows naturally out of fetichism and animism. All religious symbolism may be classified as subjective, figurative, or imitative.1 It is subjective when we aim there by to express certain sentiments or emotions, as fear or rev erence, by certain bodily attitudes, as kneeling, prostrating one's face in the dust, or raising the hands in supplication. It is figurative, when we directly represent a spiritual con ception or an abstract quality in a definite and concrete form. It is imitative when we reproduce in action the sup posed acts of a real or imaginary being. Subjective sym bolism, or the forms and attitudes of ceremonial worship, accompanies the very earliest manifestations of the religious sentiment. Figurative symbolism, or idolatry and image worship, can hardly appear until the animistic impulse is de veloped?until the gods are conceived as personal beings apart from material things. The fetich is regarded as having a life of its own, but with only a vague sense of the kinship of this life to the person ality of human beings.2 The idol in its most primitive sig nificance is the fetich consciously fashioned to represent the traits of the spirit which is supposed to reside within it. It may take the form of a man, or of an animal, or of some imaginary being embodying composite qualities of men and animals, but it must symbolize some supposed spiritual reality. In its earlier and more undeveloped stage idolatry doubtless implies a very real and sincere belief in the existence of beings such as are represented, however gross may be the 11 am indebted for this analysis to Count d'Alviella's able discussion of this question. 2 Brinton thinks the earliest conceptions of the gods were impersonal. If he means by this that they did not exemplify an anthropomorphic personality? I should agree with him. ( Vide " Primitive Religions," by Daniel G. Brin ton, Ph.D.)</page><page sequence="16">i6 The Sew anee Review. symbolism. Pure symbolism, the conscious representation of spiritual qualities in physical terms, belongs to a later and higher stage of religious evolution. In advanced forms of religion, like the Brahmanic cult of India, where images have a place in the ceremonial of wor ship, we doubtless find all forms of mental attitude, from the primitive and materialistic to the more spiritual and con sciously symbolical. It is easy to see that there is no special sanctity in the mere form of wood or stone or metal in the mind of the idolater, any more than in that of the fetich worshiper. The presence of the spirit, which alone gives sanctity to the image, is usually assured by priestly rites and ceremonials. In China images are sold for a few " cash " in the shops, precisely like those which are worshiped in the temples, but they possess no religious significance or value until they have received the priestly rites of sanctifica tion. The Polynesian islanders make wooden figures into which the priests are believed to project the souls of the dead or of the gods. These spirits, it is thought, can be drawn out again by passing certain sanctified feathers over the image, and can be transferred through the feathers to another image. This power of the priests over the gods and spirits is of manifest utility in enabling them to main tain their authority over the people. Even among the He brews small consecrated images called teraphim were car ried from place to place, receiving reverence, as late as the time of David.1 The New Zealanders carve images of the dead, and place them in their houses and tombs. They clothe and feed them, believing that the indwelling spirits are thereby comforted and nourished. The ancient Egyp tians placed statues or statuettes in the tombs of the dead, which were believed to be the abode of the Ka, or double, until the final resurrection. The Siamese represent the de mons of disease as existing in human shape, and exorcise them into clay images, which they then proceed to execute by hanging or drowning, thus effecting a cure of the patient, a primitive mode of healing by mental suggestion. The composite forms of many of the idols of Assyria, 1Gen. xxxi. 19, 30, et seq.; 1 Sam. xix. 13, 16; Judges xviii. 14, iS; etc.</page><page sequence="17">Comparative Study of Religions. 17 Chaldea, Phoenicia, and India lend themselves readily to a curious and highly developed symbolism. Wings suggest the power of rapid transportation through space; a lion's body or head, or the head or body of a bull, symbolize strength or virility. Many arms suggest omnipotent power; many eyes, omniscience. Though belief in the existence of real beings with such composite forms was doubtless com mon in early times, this fact does not depreciate the signifi cance of the symbolism; for it was this which the imagina tion utilized to create the conception of such beings, which subsequently took objective form in the idols; as in all art the thought antedates and determines the expression. The use of animal forms in idolatrous symbolism was doubtless often derived directly from the worship of the an imal as a fetich; but the animals themselves, in such in stances, were symbolical in the minds of their worshipers of supernatural powers which they did not actually possess. The curious notion known as totemism, which prevails among the American Indians and other savage peoples, il lustrates the symbolical nature of such beliefs. The totem is the symbol of the great tribal ancestor; but descent in such cases is not traced from any actual bear, or wrolf, or eagle, but from some great mythical prototype of these animals, supposed to be possessed of supernatural qualities. The highest forms of symbolism appear when the great powers of nature are personified and represented in statues, drawings, and bas-reliefs. This accompanies a high develop ment of the anthropomorphic tendency, akin to some of the earliest as well as to some of the latest and noblest phases of the religious sentiment?the tendency which impels men to picture their deities with human forms and attributes. While the deeper and more developed thought of the later time tends to outgrow and discard these symbolical conceptions, and the function of pure philosophy is to strip away all ver bal disguises, and place the soul face to face with the actual reality of things?to transform idols into ideals?we must recognize the fact that a very noble and lovely type of char acter is still consistent with the clinging of the soul to this* 2</page><page sequence="18">i8 The Sewanee Review. religious imagery and symbolism. The Greek philosophers, some of the Hindoo sages of this and former generations, and the Roman Catholic saints are examples of this type of mind, which even Protestantism has not wholly outgrown.1 The tendency of those forms of religion whose founders have renounced and condemned idolater, like the Buddhist, the Christian, and the Mohammedan, to revert to some objective form of religious symbolism, is also a noteworthy phenome non in religious evolution. Bearing these facts in mind, and reflecting on the real meaning and utility of these primitive phases of religion in the minds of their devotees, we shall think twice before we draw a sharp line of demarcation be tween fetichism and idolatry on the one hand and the loftiest expression of the religious sentiment on the other. We shall recognize our own intellectual kinship to these faiths, which we have been taught to regard as alien, and treat them ten derly, like the outgrown garments of childhood. We shall see in these very notions, once universal, the pathetic grop ings of the undeveloped mind of man toward a knowledge of the Power and Beneficence in which the world is em bosomed, and find in them the bonds of brotherhood and re ligious unity, rather than the decree of sectarian animosity and separation. With a larger charity, we shall push forward to loftier spiritual heights, and a clearer intellectual appre hension of religious truth, without spurning the ladder on which our spiritual ancestors have climbed, or contempt for the lowlands which were the natal place of all the world's religions. The comparative study of religions, even in its investiga tion of the earliest movements of the mind of man, thus testi fies indubitably to the unity of the religious sentiment, and therefore to the brotherhood of the human race. It proves, as Sabatier says, that man is 4S incurably religious." It as sures us that, to judge wisely of man's latest thought, we must know man himself?the thinker?of whose age-long struggles, in the world of thought and the world of things AThe Hindoo uses his idol as the Roman Catholic or Buddhist his rosary, to promote mental concentration in religious worship.</page><page sequence="19">Comparative Study of Religions. 19 and the world of men, of whose hopes and fears, of whose joys and sorrows, of whose triumphs and aspirations to ward ideals yet unattained, we are all the inheritors. In re calling the world's sages and thinkers and saints, the com parative study of religions teaches us not to forget the part that the unnamed millions who preceded them have played in the great world drama. It adjures us to remember their age-long struggles out of the night of animalism and super stition, their patient gropings after light, their noble persist ence, which has secured to us a measure of comfort and hope and cheer, of high thought and visions of the better life, which to them was an impossibility. In the light of comparative study of archaeology, ethnol ogy, folklore, philology, psychology, and religion, certain general conclusions as to the essential nature of the religious impulse appear thus far to be fully justified. We may rest firmly in the conviction that religion is not an invention of priests or philosophers, but a natural growth out of the mind and heart of man. It is a very early acquisition of man in distinction from the brute creation, but grows out of psychological characteristics which he possesses in common with the higher orders of animal life. Religion, therefore, is not a superstition, though it often becomes incrusted with superstitious beliefs. It is rather a sz??-stition, or substan tial reality, rooted in the primary and everlasting needs of human nature. It is not identical with morality, and pre cedes morality in the order of its development. Its earliest phases are unmoral. Some of its later rites and accom paniments are even immoral. Nevertheless, the relation of religion to morality is exceedingly vital and important. It holds primitive societies together, and thus furnishes the social conditions out of which morality is evolved. In all its later and loftier manifestations it lends its sanctions for the enforcement of the mandates of the moral law. While primitive man is incapable of forming abstract ideas, and has, therefore, no conception of the infinite, in any of its aspects, it is the mysterious life of the universe, which he cannot comprehend, that first gives rise to the impulse tore</page><page sequence="20">20 The Sew anee Review. ligi?us worship. Man's earliest ideas, in this as in other realms of thought and experience, are concrete. It is only as the mind gradually acquires the faculty of abstract thought, and is able to generalize from its concrete experiences, that religion is comprehended in its universal aspects. Never theless, even in its most primitive form, religion recognizes a spiritual element in nature, and assumes its kinship to the life which it knows subjectively. This earliest thought of man concerning his relation to the environing universe needs only a normal development to lead to the logical af firmation that man is created in the divine image, that he is one in substance with the divine nature; and therefore that he is endowed writh infinite possibilities of progress toward the perfect. The fatherhood of God and brother hood of man are doctrines rooted in the very earliest re ligious movements of the human mind. In its relation to these fundamental teachings of Christianity, the comparative study of religions comes not to destroy but to fulfill. If fear of the powers resident in nature is a primitive motive to the religious impulse, so also is hope. Faith in the ability of the gods to help and succor man is as old as the apprehension of their power to injure and destroy; and in this faith are the germs of a genuine sentiment of love and trust. It is by the development of these germs, latent in the earliest grop ings of the soul after light and life, that the later and nobler forms of religious belief are differentiated from the earlier and cruder.
