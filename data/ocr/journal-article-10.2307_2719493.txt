Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. Pp. xiv + 287. $49.95. Michael Nylan, Bryn Mawr College As an introduction to the life and thought of Tung Chung-shu (176-104 B.C.), Sarah Queen's From Chronicle to Canon has many vir- tues. In company with her contemporary, Gary Arbuckle,' Queen seeks to revise older views of Tung, which tended to characterize him in one of three ways: as principal synthesizer of Yin/yang Five Phases cosmology; as slavish apologist for the pleonexia of the Han state; or as idealistic author of the T'ien jen ho yi i,&amp; ^-- ("Unity of Heaven and Man") doctrine. Queen portrays Tung Chung-shu instead as a sober reformer anxious to have the emperor accept the role of sage-priest, so that the ordinary business of the state can be left to competent Confucian moralists like himself (p. 1). To justify this portrayal, Queen must delve into the complex problems stem- ming from the traditional attribution of the Ch 'un Ch 'iu fan lu [here- after, CCFL] to Tung, so as to locate the core of Tung's teachings. In the process, she clarifies Tung's relation to earlier and later tradi- tions. In her Introduction, Queen presents a confident overview of Han political and intellectual life, preparing the reader to accept the par- ticulars of her arguments. For example, Queen carefully lays the groundwork for a reasoned review of Tung's work when she re- marks upon the continuing strength of oral traditions in Han, then cautions against the conventional view that transcriptions of older traditions inevitably end in a single "fixed" text (p. 2).2 An apt pu- pil of Michael Loewe, Queen is also mindful of the complex pro- cesses of the cross-fertilization linking philosophical ideas, cosmologi- cal principles, and political techniques at the Western Han imperial court (p. 2). Therefore, she poses hard questions of her material, not hesitating to challenge older assumptions of the field.

Following the lead of Chinese and Japanese scholars such as Su Yu, Tai Chiin-jen, Keimatsu Mitsuo, and Tanaka Masami, Queen insists that historians have exaggerated Tung Chung-shu's role in synthesizing Yin/yang Five Phases cosmology in two ways: first, the integration of Yin/yang and Five Phases theories had begun long be- fore Tung, at least by the time of the Lu shih ch'un ch'iu (compiled ca. 250 B.c.); and second, it was later thinkers, including Liu Hsiang (79-8 B.C.) and the compilor(s) of the present CCFL (A.D. 6th century?), who read Five Phases theory back into Tung's omenology. For these reasons, scholars generally agree that at least eight chapters in the extant CCFL (p'ien 38, 42, and 58-64) cannot represent Tung's original vision, since their focus is Five Phases cor- relations. Queen proceeds to argue, on the basis of title, style, and content, that the extant CCFL falls into five main conceptual blocks, each de- rived from a separate inspiration. In addition to the spurious (1) Five Phases chapters, there are (2) thirty-two exegetical chapters, each elucidating principles in the Kung-yang commentarial tradition (p'ien 1-17, 23-37); (3) seven Huang-Lao chapters (p'ien 18-22, 77-78); (4) twenty Yin/yang chapters (p'ien 41, 43-57, 79-82), which presumably reflect Tung's cosmological vision fairly closely; and (5) twelve so-called "ritual chapters" (p'ien 65-76).4 Queen 3 See also, p. 205. Cf. Michael Nylan, "Rethinking the Victory of Han Confucianism" (forthcoming). 4 Arbuckle's dissertation analyzes the CCFL in terms of nine discrete blocks: (1) p 'ien 1- 17 represent early Kung-yang traditions of uncertain authorship; (2) p'en 18-22, Huang-Lao influence; (3) p'ien 23-28, essays of mixed origin on sumptuary regulations and hierarchical rank (with only p'ien 27 on sumptuary regulations likely to be authentic); (4) p 'ien 29-34, pronouncements on ethics (which are likely to be authentic since passages in most chapters have been quoted by Pan Ku); (5) p'ien 35-37, essays on epistemology and human nature (with p'ien 35 corroborated by other Han writings); (6) p'ien 38-57, early Yin/yang Five Phases writings, showing several stages of development (with p'ien 44 and 56 most like Tung's memorials); (7) p'ien 58-64, developed Five Phases cosmological theory, which can- not be by Tung; (8) p 'ien 65-76, essays on various rituals (some reliably attributed to Tung); and (9) p'ien 77-the end, a grab-bag of leftover materials, none reliably attributed to Tung.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 631 notes, however, that even the "authentic chapters" may have been composed under diverse circumstances and at different times dur- ing the course of Tung's long official career; even the reliably early blocks contain interpolated passages that postdate Tung. Doubtless, to do full justice to questions of authenticity and dat- ing would require several book-length treatments of Tung's corpus. After all, David Pankenier's superb study of a single chapter of the CCFL covered some twenty-six pages in fine print.5 But without a chapter-by-chapter-and, in some cases, passage-by-passage-anal- ysis of that text, the true core of Tung's writings remains somewhat elusive. Moreover, the sheer compression of Queen's arguments in this section of her book creates additional problems: First, her judg- ments are often too laconic to be clear.6 For example, Queen upon occasion embraces as authentic anything that displays a logic "simi- lar" to that found in Tung's memorials, as recorded in Pan Ku's Han shu; conversely, she indicates her acceptance of other chap- ters-often in a single sentence-because they include passages that counter the suspect Five Phases chapters (see, for example, p. 81). Second, Queen has decided to postpone lengthier explanations of the philosophical background of Tung's work until a later work, despite the ordinary reader's need for more background informa- tion on key topics, including Huang-Lao and the place of the "un- crowned king," Confucius, during the Han. Third, several of Queen's arguments about authenticity rely mainly upon the sup- posed existence of "internal contradictions" witha'n chapters, for Queen apparently imagines Tung's brand of Confucianism to be somehow purer and less syncretistic than that of his contempo- raries, such as Lu Chia and Chia Yi. But given the propensity of thinkers we usually label Confucian, Legalist, or Taoist to borrow freely from one another, I doubt that the men of Han would have 5 David Pankenier, "The Scholar's Frustration Reconsidered: Melancholia or Credo?," JAOS 110.3 (1990): 434-59. 6 To cite but one instance: Queen notes that p'ien 78 stresses that the ruler is "most ho- nored without an equal"; in seeming contradiction, p'ien 22 stresses that the ruler must be "humble." Similar characterizations of the ruler are often found within the authentic writ- ings of Han Confucian masters, not only in Tung's Han shu biography, but also in writings by Chia Yi and Yang Hsiung. A second example of a "contradiction" that is insufficiently clear to me appears on p. 99.</page><page sequence="4">632 REVIEWS seen all Queen's examples to be in conflict.7 In general, Queen could have helped the reader tremendously had she only indicated the relative weight that she assigns to each argument, to allow read- ers to distinguish her vague intuitions from statements in which she has full confidence; had she more clearly differentiated her contribu- tions from those of her predecessors; and had she provided a handy chart, so that readers could check at a glance which chapters she con- siders suspect and why. (This last point is vital, as later chapters in Queen's book ask the reader to remember-and presumably make complex judgments based on-the more "reliable chapters" of the CCFL.) With Part 2, Queen turns to a new, if related topic: Tung's place within the Kung-yang tradition. She begins by reviewing the "esoter- ic attributes" invested in the Ch 'un ch 'iu text from around the latter part of the fourth century B.C., but most of this section is devoted to a reconstruction of Tung's legal theories. Comparing ideas attribut- ed to the earlier Kung-yang traditions, Tung's recorded judgments on Han court cases, and "reliable" materials from the CCFL, Queen confirms the Yen t'ieh lun's characterization of early Kung- yang interpretation, which emphasized the Kung-yang's preoccupa- tion with considering "the mental state [of the agent] when estab- lishing the [nature of] the offense."8 Queen's treatment of crime and punishment in Han makes for compelling-I nearly wrote "gripping" -reading, for it shows how appeals to Kung-yang tradi- tions (themselves variously interpreted) could affect the actual con- duct of court cases. The Kung-yang pronouncements, all too fre- quently dismissed as muddled or incoherent, appear finally in their 7 Queen's discussion of specific legal cases does not always contribute to her larger aim of demonstrating the uniqueness of Tung Chung-shu's vision, since proponents of many other traditions, including the Ku-liang, emphasized the importance of criminal intent. While Queen takes the writings of Liu Hsiang, specialist in the Ku-liang, as proof of the pervasive influence of Kung-yang traditions, it is equally likely that Liu Hsiang's theoretical writings on intent show instead a general Ju preoccupation that goes beyond the Kung-yang traditions. 8 In other words, strict adherence to the letter of the law is less important when weighing criminal cases than a consideration of the intention of the accused. See Huan Kuan ; ,, Yen t'ieh lun chien chu MMA#WM, with commentary by Ma Fei-pai ,%14 (Beijing: Chung-hua shu-chui, 1984), pp. 55, 57.

Still, Queen's analysis would have profited from a comparison of Kung-yang traditions about criminal justice (including those of Tung) with similar passages from the Documents traditions. Since the relevant Documents chapters predate by centuries the time when any notion akin to "individual moral autonomy" (p. 145) could conceiv- ably have arisen, they would tend to undermine Queen's conclusion that Tung's legal writings were not only unique but also uniquely important in defining ideas of "Confucian personhood." This section nonetheless does an admirable job acquainting the reader with the many rifts within Han Confucianism, one of the most important of which concerned the choice between conserving the Way of Chou and making a more radical break with the past by following the new dispensation of the uncrowned king, Confucius (p. 185). Had Queen chosen to elaborate upon the historical conse- quences of this split within the Confucian camp, she could have shown how the Kung-yang advocacy of Confucius's "new dispensa- tion" eventually spelt big trouble for many Kung-yang adherents at the Han court.9 She chose instead to follow another intriguing link, that of possible connections between Mencius and the Kung-yang tra- dition. But does Queen really see Mencius as a precursor to or proponent of Kung-yang oral traditions, or are similarities between the Kung-yang and Mencius texts largely attributable to the fact that both came out of the same intellectual milieu? What does it mean that Tung Chung-shu "wrote a book extolling Sun Ch'ing [that is, Hsuin tzu]?"''0 If all the evidence for such connections were mar- shaled in Queen's future work, we might come to understand both the context and subtext of Tung's writings on human nature, which at present seem a compromise between the theories of Mencius and Hsuin tzu. 9 For the history of Kung-yang studies, I recommend two recent books not found in Queen's bibliography: Li Hsin-lin i3T, Ch'un Ch'iu Kung-yang chuan yao yi *#,9TI (Taipei: Wen-chin ch'u-pan-she, 1989); and Wang Pao-hsiian ET*, Hsi Han ching hsuieh yuan liu Pqf 3i,r (Taipei: Tung-ta t'u-shu kung-ssu, 1994).

It is probable that neither of these cycles originat- ed with Tung." And it is certain that the influence of Tung and the later Kung-yang traditions on Han court rituals-as opposed to law-was negligible. Not surprisingly, bureaucrats and ritualists alike were quick to condemn what they perceived as the corrupting aspects of Kung-yang teachings, especially the insistence on ch 'ian g (weighing moral priorities), which critics saw as an open invitation for special pleading.12 Equally to the point, Tung's own ritual activi- ties (his rainmaking, concern with omens, use of the "Confucian" Classics as protective talismans, and so forth) were as liable to threaten the central government's interests as to support them.'3 Unimportant though these particular rituals were in later Chinese history, Tung thought them vitally important, for it was correct ritual performance that was to secure his cosmological statements, scriptural interpretations, and political policies. It is, then, to the subject of sacred ritual-specifically, sacred tex- tual traditions-that Queen returns in her final chapter on canon, cosmos, and court patronage. This chapter is so densely-written that it is more opaque to me than earlier sections, perhaps because Queen draws fine distinctions that she does not fully explicate (for example, between "correlative cosmology" and "interactive cos- " Note that Fu Sheng's tM Shang shu ta chuan M,At already refers to Three Correct Year Beginnings (san-cheng -E, also known as the Three Standards [san-t'ung]) in addi- tion to the alternation of "refined and basic" (wen-chih /i.2). See A Concordance to the Shang- shudazhuan (ICS Ancient Chinese Texts Concordance Series no. 5), pp. 10, lines 15-22; 25, line 26. 12 The theory of ch'uan accepted that moral conventions might occasionally need to be overturned so as to gain a more significant moral good. 13 This is implicit in Ying Shao's PWJ Feng su t'ungyi Affi, chuian 9, where Tung uses the classics as talisman to thwart Wu ti's attempt to have a shaman curse him.

Moreover, when Queen remarks that the two main religious dimensions of the Confucian world view consist of an ulti- mate continuity between Heaven and humanity and the ability of humanity to "know" Heaven (p. 240), I worry. Both assertions are entirely consistent with strictly materialist views of the world, such as those advocated later by Wang Ch'ung (A.D. 27-97). But Queen is surely correct in stressing the religious dimensions of Tung's thought, since extant descriptions of his teaching method remind us of the utterly sacred character of the "Confucian" classics. Hidden away from the vulgar masses, Tung Chung-shu communicated the mysterious Way to members of his chosen circle, who would then pass on the basic points, if not the finer esoteric insights, to lesser dis- ciples through oral transmission. Queen's Chronicle to Canon covers an astonishing range of topics, with only small missteps."4 Since my own interests in Han studies center on processes of change, I wish that Queen had made it clear just how mainstream the Kung-yang proponents, with their radical stress on "elevation of the worthy," were in mid-Western Han, and just how peculiar and embattled they were to become by Eastern Han. I would also have liked to have seen Tung portrayed against a suitable backdrop: the increasing gap between the institutional classicism upheld by "vulgar Ju" and the ardent practice of a few would-be Confucian masters. Indeed, this gap would, in Tung's own time, become one of the central problems of Han Ju writing. But these comments represent a single historian's quibbles over approach-a topic about which reasonable people often disagree. 14 Among her very few misstatements: p. 233, on the "proscription" of rival traditions to Confucianism. As Queen herself knows, Emperor Wu never enforced the various decrees ban- ning Huang-Lao and Legalist students from office; the latter in particular came to dominate the court as his reign went on; p. 14, on the biographical details of Tung's life being "inacces- sible" to Ssu-ma Ch'ien. Tung and Ssu-ma Ch'ien were contemporaries at Han Wu ti's court; moreover, both were enemies of Kung-sun Hung. There is every reason to think that Ssu-ma Ch'ien would have known Tung's life well; and on p. 51, where the "Great Plan" is presented as one of the Odes. In the absence of characters, I can only imagine that Queen refers to the Documents chapter. I would also query Queen's assertion that Tung saw Heaven as an anthropomorphic deity, for it is just possible that Tung's references to a personalized Heaven are conventional, reflecting the absence of a more precise expression. Even Hsuin tzu's writings occasionally include passages that could be construed to refer to an anthropo- morphic deity.</page><page sequence="8">636 REVIEWS My sole quarrel with this substantive book concerns Queen's promise to use the life and work of Tung Chung-shu to illustrate what she regards as the main message of early Confucianism: that the development of "personhood" or "spirituality" is an "inter- dependent process" (p. 1). I confess myself somewhat uncomfort- able with this portrait of Tung as sober scholar and secular humanist in the Ming dynasty mode-a portrait that ignores important clues offered by Tung's near contemporaries, who frequently portrayed him and his ilk as magicians or troublemakers. 5 I grant that Tung's legal writings attest to his firm belief in the attainability of an ideal realm of Man (which includes both state and society), where abso- lute hierarchy would be tempered with notions of reciprocity, in the spirit of the Rectification of Names dictum. In that utopia, rulers and fathers would insure their own authority through their suasive example while fostering the moral development of their inferiors. I grant also that many Han thinkers showed an intense interest in what Queen calls "Confucian personhood" and I would call "self-cultivation." Still, the Tung Chung-shu who appears in the extant historical records seldom comments upon such questions of self-cultivation, except as they relate to the more pressing task of devising proper supports for the state as various as the Academy (t'ai-hsueh tW), local rain sacrifices, and omenological guidelines. Tung's work, in other words, is overwhelmingly concerned with po- litical and juridical matters-top-down reforms. Like Tzu-hsia and Mencius before him, the Tung of tradition equates the transforma- tive powers of the Ch 'un ch 'iu mainly with an ability to rid the state of rebellious subjects. 15 Queen in her last chapter insists upon "the decidedly secular tone of Confucian thought" (p. 234), implying that Tung as "father of Confucianism" was a secular humanist. The relation of Tung to the fang-shih t/:? remains unclear, though several near contempora- ry accounts portray Tung as a magician, perhaps because of his status as omen specialist (for example, Han shu 56.2515). Note also that the opening passage of the Li chi, "Ching chieh" chapter says that students of the Ch 'un ch 'iu have tended towards "troublemaking" (luan ML). According to Han shu 75.3154, which preserves a memorial by Sui Hung dated to 78 B.C., Tung always said that the house of Han, as descendants of Yao, would eventually have to ab- dicate in favor of a true worthy representing the new dispensation of the "uncrowned king" Confucius. Perhaps for this reason, in the Lun heng, Wang Ch'ung feels the need to defend Tung against charges that his writings "go against the Confucians" and "oppose Confu- cius. " See Lun heng chiao shih A t, comp. Huang Hui *FM (Beiping, Commercial Press, 1935?) 29.1163.</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 637 That being the case, it is hard for me to imagine Tung as a propo- nent of "individual moral autonomy''16 -at least in any modern sense of the term. In all likelihood, Han notions of honor and dis- honor were framed with reference to strong class and community loyalties; only in the case of very bad rulers could they envision a sharp conflict between moral action and communal convention. But Tung was hardly adverse to flattering his ruler and endowing him with all the virtues of a sage. Let me continue to play the devil's ad- vocate: does Queen's own admission that Tung was one of the first to "consistently privilege the yang aspects . . . over those of yin" a conclusion corroborated by close studies of Han theories of ritual and domestic life-not suggest that we may argue with equal justice that Tung may have been one of the first Confucian thinkers to deni- grate the personhood of half the entire Chinese population, making the female a definite inferior?17 I suspect that Queen's impulse to omit the unlikable and the strange in Tung's portrayal relates to a larger phenomenon: all of us who have worked on individual thinkers are apt not only to mag- nify their importance but also to think them very much like our- selves. 18 This is only to be expected, since we have tried to live inside the hearts and minds of these individuals for years on end. Hence, 16 At points, by "individual moral autonomy" Queen seems only to mean a "higher allegi- ance to humaneness." But Queen fails to show what the term "humaneness" (jen L1) really meant in Tung's writings. This is unfortunate, given the varying connotations ofjen in Han times. See Benjamin Wallacker, "Han Confucianism and Confucius in Han," in Ancient Chi- na: Studies in Early Civilization, ed. David T. Roy and Tsuen-hsiun Tsien (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1978), pp. 215-28. 17 Having begun research on Han domestic life, I can confirm Queen's assertion that Tung may have been one of the first thinkers, if not the first to see yin/yang as stark opposites (rather than as complementary relations), with yin the definite inferior. Lisa Raphals comes to similar conclusions about Tung's position on women's inferiority, supporting it with evi- dence from recently excavated texts. See her manuscript, Sharing the Light, pp. 171-73. 18 Queen probably has given too much credit to Tung for innovations. Do Tung Chung- shu and his disciples, for instance, really deserve the entire credit for establishing a "scriptur- al basis for the practice of law that would survive for centuries to come" (p. 181)? Many of the ideas discussed by Tung also appear in the Documents traditions, as stated above. And the seasonal correlation of virtue versus punishment appears earlier, in the Mawangdui texts. Had Tung truly "revolutionized" the court through his legal writings, surely his near con- temporaries would have recorded that fact. Instead, Tung's contemporaries believed his most significant contribution to be the particular omenology that he read into the Ch 'un Ch 'iu text (p. 217).</page><page sequence="10">638 REVIEWS my own mounting dissatisfaction with any study of a single person-however good. Just as good archaeologists-as opposed to connoisseurs-look at assemblages of objects, modern-day clas- sicists must begin to think in terms of assemblages of texts, lest they romanticize their subjects or continually reinvent the wheel. Hav- ing said that, I would like to congratulate Sarah Queen upon her work in From Chronicle to Canon. It represents a solid achievement, upon which students of Han will surely build.</page></plain_text>
