Most interesting, perhaps, is the third chapter on the development of the singing instinct in its various forms. He then treats other courtship phenomena-drumming, tumbling, play- ing, mock fighting, etc. Finally, he discusses the development and significance of the courting instinct and the relations between reflexes, instinct and play, and ends with a good nomenclature. Les Arts et Mdtiers chez les Animaux, par H. COUPIN. Nony &amp; Cie, Paris, 1902. pp. 422. This ingenious and industrious writer has collected from many sources accounts of the industries of animals, which he classifies as masons, potters, weavers, paper makers, cotton makers, mound build- ers, road and bridge makers, sewers, wax moulders, rosin makers, tapisers, miners, basket makers, wheel makers, confectioners, cigar makers, hammock makers, comb maKers, spinners, architects of houses of amusement, carpenters, hut builders, ditch makers, stone borers, etc. La Logique chez 1' Enfant et sa Culture, par FRED;RIC QUEYRAT. F. Alcan, Paris, I902. pp. I57. This naturally follows the two earlier works of the author on "Im- agination and its varieties in children " and "Abstraction and its r61e in education." First comes the logic of images with examples seen in their comparisons and the construction of phrases and propositions, personification and anthropomorphism. Analogical reasoning is thus the first type. Child sophisms are classified under induction (mainly those of insufficient data, errors concerning causes and sophisms of accidence) and deduction or a begging question, and ignorance of the subject and vicious circle. The chief faults of children might be characterized as due to credulity, candor, naYvete, folly, precipitation, prejudgment, irreflection, sentiment and imagination. The last chap- ter praises the importance of rational training. Der Selbstmord im kindlichen Lebensalter, von A. BAER. G. Thieme, Leipzig, I90I. pp. 84. A member of the council of public hygiene in Berlin here ably sums up the history of the statistics of suicide of youth in France, Italy, an(l especially Germany, and draws therefrom important lessons. He holds that the chief cause is not to be found in the school, although he would relieve it from over pressure and especially from the worry of examina- tions, to which some cases especially in the lower schools can be directly traced. The chief cause to him is precocity or the premature develop- ment of an adult sense of responsibility, altruism or knowledge, and finds it most frequent in the lowest and in the highest stages of society, or better among the poorest and the richest strata of society. Of twenty- five interesting cases, he has himself made a special study. It is ex- tremely desirable to have data on this subject collected with the same care for Anglo-Saxon races. The Four Temperaments in Children. Their Appearance and Treat- ment in Rearing and in the School. As Appendix: The Tempera- ment of Parents and Teachers. By BERNHARD HELLWIG. J. Esser, Paderborn. pp. 79. This is an interesting characterization of each of the four phrenologi- cal types of childhood-the sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic. The treatment proper to each type is considered, and there is an appendix on the temperament of parents and teachers. Whatever we may think of phrenology, this book is of much interest and value. 322</page></plain_text>
