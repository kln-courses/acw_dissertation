<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mnemosyne, Vol. XLII, Fase. 1-2 (1989) ???? ?pat? AND THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 BY LEON GOLDEN Book 14 of the Iliad is divided into three discrete sections of roughly equal length. The central part of the book, the scene in which Hera adroitly seduces Zeus, stands in astonishing emotional contrast to the anguished conference of Greek leaders which precedes, and the savage scenes of war, which follow it1). So strik- ingly anomalous in tone is the ???? ?pat? that Wilamowitz asserted that this passage could not have been written by the same poet who recorded the courageous advance of Hektor to hand to hand com- bat with Aias in Book 12 and described the aristeia of Idomeneus in Book 132). 1) H. Erbse, Zeus und Here auf dem Idagebirge, Antike und Abendland, 16 (1970), 93, comments appropriately on the remarkable change in tone from the first to the second section of the book: "Eben hatte man vernommen, dass Hektor nach aufreibenden Gefechten die troischen Truppen neu ordnet, um ?ber die Schutz- mauer der Griechen zu den Schiffen vorzustossen (Ende des 13. Buches), hatte mit Beklemmung geh?rt, mit welcher Besorgnis die verwundeten griechischen Feldherren dem Fortgang des Kampfes entgegensehen (Anfang des 14. Buches), da wendet sich die Erz?hlung einem ganz andersartigen Bereich zu: Here, die Freundin der Griechen, schickt sich an, ihren Gemahl Zeus in einer Liebesstunde einzuschl?fern, um zu verhindern, dass er seine Aufmerksamkeit der Schlacht vor Troia wieder zuwende". C. Rothe, Die Ilias als Dichtung (Paderborn 1910), 270, tells us that elsewhere in the Iliad Homer has made his narrative more effective by the use of emotionally contrasting scenes and "so hat er hier vielleicht zuerst nur die verwundeten K?nige eingef?hrt und sp?ter erst Zeus' Bet?rung hin- zugef?gt, um die Unterbrechung der Kampfesszenen wirksamer zu gestalten". 2) U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, Die Ilias und Homer (Berlin 1966 [originally published 1920]), 232, writes: "Unverkennbar ist der Unterschied von Stimmung und Sinnesart zwischen dem Dichter, der den Zeus ber?cken l?sst, und dem Dichter, der in grossartiger Geradlinigkeit seinen Hektor durch das Tor zum Kampfe mit Aias f?hrt, auch zu dem Verfasser des Idomeneusgedichtes, der nur wie ein Krieger f?r Krieger dichtet". Erbse, op.cit., 95 quotes this passage from Wilamowitz and emphasizes the anomalous nature of the ???? ap?t? scene: "Wohin jedoch sind wir geraten! Einem Heldenepos, das von blutigen K?mpfen um eine dem Untergang geweihte Stadt erz?hlt, scheint sich die skizzierte olym-</page><page sequence="2">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 Erbse, on the basis of a careful study of the action of books 13-15 rejects the idea that the seduction scene is a discordant interloper into the authentic plot of the Iliad. He argues that Homer effectively correlates Hera's deception of Zeus with Poseidon's intervention on the side of the Greeks in their struggle against the Trojans. He points out that Poseidon, at the beginning of book 13, appeared among the wavering ranks of the Greeks, to give them encourage- ment and that in the beginning of book 14 he offers a promise of victory to the anxious Greek generals. Erbse establishes a close nar- rative connection between the seduction scene and the ongoing war by arguing that Hera purposely selects the stratagem of seduction as an effective means by which she can support this pledge of assistance by Poseidon to the Greeks. The two actions are com- plementary aspects of a single design which unifies, in Erbse's view, books 13-15. He concludes (98): "Man sieht aber deutlich, dass der Verfasser des 13. Buches, der Zeus seinen Blick zu den friedlichen Nordv?lkern schweifen und Poseidon in die Schlacht um Troia eingreifen l?sst, Heres Intrige und ihre Konsequenzen bereits konzipiert hat; denn die Aktion des Bruders und die List der Gemahlin schliessen sich zu einer einzigen Gegenhandlung zusam- men, an welcher der Ratschluss des Zeus scheitern soll. Dass dieses feindliche Unternehmen fast zum Erfolg f?hrt, wird nur durch Heres Intrige erreicht*', (italics mine) Erbse goes on to establish further narrative connections between the seduction scene and the principal action of the Iliad. He argues that the sequence of events, which is set in motion by Patroklos' entrance into battle in the place of Achilles, is itself a direct conse- quence of the battle scenes of books 13-15. He states that without the unfolding of these prior incidents the Patroklos scene in book 16 would be unthinkable and he emphasizes that in the midst of these earlier circumstances which prepare the way for the misfor- tune that befalls Patroklos "steht die Szene, von der wir ausgegangen sind, das scheinbar so fremdartige, jedoch f?r den Ablauf der Handlung so unentbehrliche Treffen des h?chsten G?t- terpaares auf dem Idagebirge" (105). pische Szene kaum einzuf?gen. ... denn es l?sst sich kaum einsehen, was diese respektlose, ans Blasphemische grenzende Episode f?r das epische Gedicht bedeuten soll".</page><page sequence="3">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 Thus Erbse has persuasively shown that the seduction scene has a close narrative connection with other extremely important motifs in the Iliad. He rejects the view that the anomalous tone of the seduction scene severs it from an organic relationship with the prin- cipal subject of the poem, and he emphasizes the serious dimen- sions of an apparently comic action. Yet the striking contrast between anthropomorphic comic action on the divine level and poignant suffering on the human plane requires us to go even fur- ther than he does in assessing the meaning of the seduction scene. The comic nature of this scene is well understood by Plebe but he, unfortunately, does not deal with the structure of the book as a whole. He describes three levels of humor and laughter which we find in Homer: the most primitive of these is "il riso di gioia", a serene emotion that is not genuinely comic and is found in nature and sometimes at moments of victory in battle; a more developed form of humor involves "il comico della derisione", which fre- quently arises when matters of bravery and cowardice are at issue and where the comic tone is ancillary to another theme; finally there is a pure stage of comedy, "il riso della beffa", which is often found in situations involving love. Plebe correctly identifies the literal ???? ap?t? scene as an example of this third, fully mature stage of comedy3). 3) A. Plebe, La nascita del comico nella vita e nelV arte degli antichi Greci, (Bari 1956), offers a perceptive view of the comic dimensions of the literal At?c ?pat? scene. He writes accurately of Hera's skilful plot (39): "Sul come far addormentare il marito, Era non ha alcun dubbio: bastera spingerlo a consumare le sue energie sul talamo coniugale. Tutto sta quindi nell' organizzare une seduzione che sia dav- vero efficace. Ecco quindi la buona moglie all' opera". In surveying the character of the entire scene he says (39-40): "Abbiamo in questo episodio tutti gli elementi dello spirito ionico, che dicemmo: la beffa, l'astuzia, l'amore. E certo la figura della moglie astuta che beffa il marito ingenuo ? tra quelle che sorgono pi? spon- tanee nella vita commune di un popolo astuto e vicace come gli Ioni. Altrettanto spontanea sorge la beffa per le disavventure amorose, per i mariti traditi, per gli adulteri scoperti. Con essa, sempre pi? s'arrocchisce la psicologia popolare del senso del comico. La fantasia del popolo comincia a godere di soffermarsi sulle situazioni della vita che pi? son strane e contraddittorie e quindi comiche". For Plebe the seduction scene manifests the essence of comedy and he is clearly correct in pointing out the subtle and not so subtle actions of Hera that contribute so effec- tively to this emphatic comic mood. Yet Plebe's analysis leaves this scene adrift in the total structure of book 14.</page><page sequence="4">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 Like Plebe, Cedric Whitman is appreciative of the comic over- tones of the seduction scene but also like Plebe he mistakenly believes that the comedy is developed "for its own sake". A valuable corrective to this view, suggestive of the interpretative direction that we will need to follow, is the perception of Karl Reinhardt that the farcical scenes involving the gods "gelegentlich in dunklen Andeutungen auftauchen" and that the light tone of several of those scenes conceals something quite fearful4). The unity of book 14, as we shall see, arises from the very diversity of its parts and especially from the way in which the joyously comic and pointedly sardonic elements of the encounter between Hera and Zeus clash against the depiction of human anxieties amid the ruin of war in the first and last episodes of the book. I will proceed now to examine the thematic structure of book 14 and the significant contribution which the seduction scene makes to the design of this pivotal chapter in the unfolding of the plot of the Iliad. Despair is the dominant mood of the first section of book 14(1- 152). Nestor and the three wounded generals, Diomedes, Odysseus, and Agamemnon are dispirited as they evaluate their military position. Hera's seduction of Zeus follows immediately upon the gloom of this opening scene. She catches sight of Poseidon 4) C. Whitman, Homer and the Heroic Tradition (Cambridge, Mass., 1958), 240- 41: "It is idle to point to this scene of Zeus and Hera as Homer's way of dragging in the Sacred Marriage myth of Argos, and to say that it is an example of Homer's deep religiosity. Actually, it required something more like blasphemy to represent the Sacred Marriage as a deceitful seduction, followed by the threat of beating. ... The seduction of Zeus, developed at length for its own sake, is entirely in the spirit of comedy, and like all scenes between the king and queen of Olympus, it ends with a sort of rough-and-ready peacemaking for the moment, with Zeus con- quering by force and Hera silently vowing her revenge. What is starkest tragedy on earth is often imaged in heaven as a light and sometimes slapstick comedy". K. Reinhardt, Tradition und Geist (G?ttingen 1960), 23-24: "Auch durch die homerischen G?tterszenen blickt ein ?lteres gr?beres Genus hindurch, das durch das Epos gleichfalls sich geadelt hat; der G?tterschwank. Bei dem homerischen Gel?chter der Olympier (I, 599), bei dem heilig unheiligen Schlaf des Zeus in Heras Armen ist nicht zu vergessen, dass Geschichten von List, Fesselung, Aufruhr, Heimlichkeiten der G?tter voreinander, die gelegentlich in dunklen Andeutungen auftauchen, auf ein schon vorhomerisches 'Genus' deuten. Auch hier wieder wurden aus Geschichten Situationen; durch Homers und seiner Zeit Erhabenheit erhoben sie sich auf die H?he jenes leichten und durch seine 'Leichtigkeit' furchtbaren Spiels, an dem sich sp?tere Zeiten so gestossen haben".</page><page sequence="5">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 from the peaks of Olympus as he toils to bring victory to the Greeks. Rejoicing in her heart she ponders how she can assist his efforts and she decides that the best contribution she can make to their common purpose is to keep Zeus out of the war as long as possible. We know that narrative unity exists between the seduction scene and the conclave of wounded leaders (see Erbse, 96) but what is not unified is the sharply clashing mood of the two parts. The despair of the introductory scene of the book abruptly gives way to a fascinating comic drama in which anthropomorphic cunning and lust play central roles. The narrative connection which Erbse cor- rectly describes does not account for the sharp change of mood, from despair to whimsical delight, that accompanies the story of Hera's crafty sexual manipulation of Zeus. Nor does it offer a justification for the second violent change of mood that follows the seduction episode and accompanies the savagery of the battlefield scenes which conclude the book. In spite of the valid arguments in favor of narrative unity, we face an important interpretative problem: do we have in the seduction scene a disconcerting viola- tion of the epic mood by an inappropriately lighthearted action or do we have a subtle but profound elaboration of a major motif of the work as a whole? In order to answer this question we will need to make a detailed analysis of each of the component elements of the seduction scene. Once Hera has decided to entice Zeus she proceeds to plan her attack as if it were a military campaign. Erbse finds precisely the right connotation when he says she "r?stet sich" (97) in prepara- tion for her encounter with Zeus for she does indeed "arm herself from head to toe as she bathes, anoints herself with aromatic oil whose delicate aroma reaches both heaven and earth, and adorns herself with the most enticing clothing and jewelry she possesses. This is her armament and there is a clear parallel in the careful listing of Hera's several allurements to the catalogue of military equipment donned when a soldier prepares for hand to hand combat5). It is not without deep significance that the conflict 5) See the description of the arming of Paris at 3, 330-339 and the arming of Athena at 5, 733-47. K. Reinhardt, Die Ilias und ihr Dichter (G?ttingen 1961), 291,</page><page sequence="6">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 between Hera and Zeus is carried out with such different weapons and with such different results from heroic combat on the bat- tlefield. The ironic contrast between the amusing strategy of seduc- tion which immobilizes Zeus in the war and its bloody counterparts on the human level which lethally terminate the careers of many a brave warrior is, we shall see, the key to understanding the unifying role of the seduction scene in book 146). With her full armament in place and with the strategic acquisi- tion of Aphrodite's belt and Sleep's assistance, Hera is ready for the climactic encounter with Zeus (293-353). Homer brilliantly sets the stage for the success of her plan by demonstrating Zeus's defenseless vulnerability to her sexual advances. The very minute he catches sight of her e??? seizes him like that ?te p??t?? pe? ???s??s??? f???t?t?/e?? e???? f??t??te f????? ?????te t???a? and he urges, "??? d' a?' ?? f???t?t? t?ape???e? e??????te". When Hera pretends to be shocked at this suggestion of an immediate sexual encounter that could bring shame and derision upon her, she receives Zeus' solemn assurance that he will protect her modesty with a golden cloud that even the sharpest rays of the sun will not penetrate. Then Homer conjures up a lyrical, rapturous, and magnificent scene (346-51). Clothed in a golden cloud, bathed by glistening dew, resting on a soft bed of fresh grass and thick, soft had already observed in regard to Hera's actions in this scene that "Was sich im Geheimen abspielt, ist eine R?stungszene eigener Art. Die R?stung ist ihre Toilette". . . 6) B. Seidensticker, Palintonos Harmon?a: Studien zu komischen Elementen in der griechischen Trag?die, Hypomnemata 72 (G?ttingen 1982), 58, precisely understands what Homer intends in this scene, and other similar ones, when he writes: "Was auf den ersten Blick wie naive Juxtapositon erscheinen mag, erweist sich bei genauerem Zusehen als sorgfaltig durchdachter und arrangierter Kontrast. Der folgenlose olympische Ehekrach ist ein komisch-ironisches Gegenbild zu dem verh?ngnisvollen Streit zwischen Achilleus und Agamemnon, der Tausende das Leben kostet; die Liebesr?stung der Hera und die frivole Verf?hrung des Zeus auf dem Ida stehen in der Mitte des m?rderischen Kampfes um das Schiffslager; und das risikolose Geraufe der Unsterblichen in Buch 21 ist genau zwischen Achilleus' blutige Metzelei am Skamander und den das Schicksal Trojas besiegelnden Tod Hektors gestellt". He perceptively recognizes that the great significance of such scenes is that they form a "Gegenbild zu der ausweglosen Tragik des menschlichen Schicksals" (58) and that "die Tragik der menschlichen Existenz vertieft wird durch die ?berlegenheit und sorglose Unverbindlichkeit des g?tt- lichen Lebens" (59).</page><page sequence="7">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 flowers Zeus experiences a moment of impassioned ecstasy. Nowhere else in this poem that is devoted so largely to anger, violence, and slaughter do we have so exultant an evocation of pure joy? With Hera's triumph over Zeus accomplished, the third and final scene of the book begins at line 363 after Sleep has reported the successful exploit to Poseidon. If the principal mood of the first scene was despair, and of the second, comedy wedded to lyrical joy, the bitter tone of the final episode evokes the savagery of war. Here a series of violent deaths in battle are memorialized by the scorn heaped on the vanquished by the victors. The climactic moment of the battle scene which concludes book 14 comes in the confrontation between Peneleos and the Trojan Ilioneus (487-505) where Homer recounts Peneleos's triumph in pitiless detail. He rejoices in his desecration of Ilioneus's body and in the emotional pain he will inflict on the parents who vainly await their son's return from battle. Just as Homer carefully portrayed every psychological nuance in the seduction scene, so also here he insists that we face every gruesome physical detail in the massacre of Ilioneus. We follow the course of the penetrating spear from its entrance below the eyebrow where it plunges down into the roots of the eye and smashes the eyeball out of its socket to its exit through the back of the slaughtered soldier's neck. We watch Peneleos violently hack the helmeted head from the neck of the outstretched warrior with his sword, and forcibly withdraw the spear from his victim's skull with the eye, like a poppy, still stuck to its point while he scornfully invites Ilioneus's parents to begin the lament for their son. One could argue that the same narrative con- nection links the second and third scenes of the book as unites the first and second episodes but the radical change of mood at this point is even more powerfully disruptive than it was in the transi- tion from the despair of the wounded generals to the cunning preliminaries of the seduction scene. The emotional distance we travel from the rapturous embrace of Zeus and Hera to the speared and bleeding eyeball of Ilioneus is so great that it can be justified only by the existence of a structural unity that has even deeper roots than the narrative linkage that was conclusively established by Erbse. It is thematic unity, in addition to narrative unity, that we</page><page sequence="8">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 must uncover if we are to demonstrate a cohesive bonding of the three major scenes of book 14. Such a thematic unity does exist and it reflects one of the principal motifs of the Iliad as a whole: the sharp contrast between the nearly infinite power and soaring freedom of the gods and the imprison- ment of human beings within a constraining destiny of vulnerability and impotence7). Thus the despair of the heroic generals in the first scene of book 14 and the cruel deaths in battle of brave warriors in the third episode of that book are powerful indications of the pathos of the human condition; and what makes that pathos especially poignant and unbearable is the fact that while men are dying so pitifully, Hera and Zeus, without a thought or care for the deep distress of humanity, enjoy a romantic mountain top tryst amid all the pleasurable trappings of lust and seduction. The unity of book 14 arises not only from the linking in the nar- rative of the common goals of Poseidon and Hera, but also, and very importantly, out of its uncompromising depiction of the unbridgeable distance of the gods from mankind. The most signifi- cant actions of the Iliad involve both a divine and human compo- 7) U. H?lscher, Untersuchungen zur Form der Odyssee (Berlin 1939), 49, comments: "Es kommt dieser Dichtung offenbar darauf an, gegen die schweren M?hen der menschlichen Helden das leichte Leben der G?tter zu halten, so, dass alles Irdische dort sich widerspiegelt, aber leichter und geistiger. Die grossen Anstrengungen der Menschen und V?lker sind Launen und kleine Vorlieben der G?tter, kaum wert, dass man ihretwegen in Streit gerate. Ein Schatten auf der Stirn des Zeus bringt drunten die Wolke des Unheils, und was in seiner Hand ein leichter Ausschlag der Waage ist, ist hier Entscheidung ?ber Leben und Tod. .... Der Kampf der Menschen ist f?r die G?tter zuletzt eine Art Unterhaltung. ? Der Parallelismus zwischen beiderlei Geschehen ist die Grundform der Ilias, ihre Einheit der Kontrast". See also K. Reinhardt, TuG, 24-25: "Aber die G?tter Homers haben und machen alles nicht nur wunderbar und g?ttlich, sondern haben und machen zugleich auch alles, unbeschadet ihrer Herrlichkeit, auf eine eigene Weise unernst. Sie bedrohen einander, als ob es auf Tod und Leben ginge, schreien, als ob sie am letzten w?ren, betr?gen einander, als ob sie einander st?rzen k?nnten ? aber immer, wo es sich auf Erden um Sein oder Nichtsein handelt, l?st ihr Ringen sich in ein "als ob" auf, wodurch es zum Spiele wird: nicht weil die G?tter selbst bewusstermassen spielten, sondern weil ihnen der Einsatz fehlt, durch den jedwedes Handeln erst zum Ernst wird, Tod, Vernichtung, Leiden, das dar- niederwirft, und jedwede Einbusse an Existenz. Die G?tterschlacht der Ilias spiegelt die menschlichen Heldenk?mpfe wider, aber ohne deren Vorbedingung: die Gefahr".</page><page sequence="9">THE UNITY OF ILIAD 14 nent and Homer takes abundant pains so that we see all such actions from both vantage points. The scenes of book 14 express most dramatically, what a number of other key passages in the Iliad also confirm, that events which are the most painful and destructive for human beings are often the source, directly or indirectly, of intense pleasure to the gods. Walter Burkert indicated the reason for this when he wrote8): "F?r die Welt der Ilias ist der Gegensatz des heiteren G?tterlebens und des t?dlich ernsten menschlichen Schicksals konstitutiv; man konnte dieses Nebeneinander geradezu die "innere, notwendige Form der Ilias" nennen. Der "erhabene Unernst" (Reinhardt) der G?tter ist die Gegenwelt zum menschlichen Leid, die ironische Spiegelung menschlicher Tragik. ... Sp?tere Theologie sah im Lachen der G?tter eine Minderung ihrer W?rde; in Wahrheit ist es eher Ausdruck einer ungeheuren, unheimlichen ?berlegenheit, einer wahrhaft g?ttlichen Freiheit und Sicherheit, aller nachrechnenden Menschen Vernunft weit entr?ckt". It is therefore the scornful indifference of the gods toward suffer- ing mankind that serves as the unifying theme of book 14 where it forges, with an eloquent subtlety, an organic link between scenes of despair and brutality in war and the clever, anthropomorphic seduction of Zeus by Hera. That theme is, moreover, a central motif of the Ilias as a whole and Homer expresses it quite explicitly elsewhere in the poem: t?? d' ?pa?e????e??? p??s?f? ?efe???e??ta ?e???

Murray in the Loeb edition with 41 have regard unto them, even though they die' and Lattimore, in his widely used translation, with ? think of these men though they are dying' do a better job with the line because their renditions are more ambiguous9). In translating ?????s? we must avoid attributing any idea of gen- uine 'caring' to Zeus. His explicitly stated intention (lines 22-23 above) of remaining on the peaks of Olympus in order to take pleasure in his heart at the spectacle of men killing and being killed thoroughly refutes such a view. I suggest that the context of the passage, as well as the role the gods actually play in the poem, require the use of the well attested nuance of 'to be an object of thought for' or 'to be of interest to' as the appropriate interpreta- tion of ?????s?. We can best express the meaning of the phrase here if we translate it as 'they are the object of my interest even while they are dying'10). The reason why human beings are of interest to Zeus in the special circumstances of their dying is, then, not dif- ficult to see; it arises from the pleasure which he derives from being a spectator at their lethal encounters in war. Undoubtedly this is also the reason he commands the gods, immediately after the quotation cited above, to enter the battle between the Trojans and Greeks and help whichever side they wish. Griffin, (op. cit., 184-204) does an excellent job of tracing the incidents in the Iliad in which Zeus treats human beings with cruelty or indifference. He believes, however, that Homer accepts, as a reality, a Zeus who can both pity and love as well as ignore and hate human beings. I rather think that Burkert's view (cited above) that Homer's gods live in a world of total exultation and security that is completely separated from the tragedy of human existence is a better explanation of their behavior in this poem. The conversa- 9) Most translators take p?? as concessive as it very often is with the participle in Homer. It is also quite possible that p?? strongly emphasizes the specific cir- cumstance of 'dying' as opposed to 'living' here and, if so, we should translate it as 'even' rather than 'although'. 10) I am indebted to a suggestion from Prof. J.
