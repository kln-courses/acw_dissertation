<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nature of Man FREDERICK J. E. WOODBRIDGE Visiting Roosevelt Professor of American History and Institutions in the University of Berlin of philosophy would have us remember HISTORIANS Hegel, with honor and thankfulness, during this hundredth anniversary of the year of his death. In the situation in which I find myself, I must remember Fichte. I am compelled to. I know well that Hegel has influenced the development of philoso- phy much more and more deeply than Fichte. Today, however, I am not thinking of this development. I am thinking rather of our obli- gations, our necessities, and above all of our imperative need as men to learn what we can about our nature and our destiny. Surely a phi- losopher - and I must add, an American, who in Germany would venture to speak about the nature of man - must remember Fichte. He cannot do otherwise. Fichte's time, like ours, was a time when the problem of human destiny lay heavily on men's minds. It is true that Fichte spoke to the German nation, but his voice carried beyond na- tional boundaries and was heard by alien ears. His book, Die Bestim- mung des Menschen, has become a book for mankind. It can be read today. It may, however, be read in two ways, either to get an understand- ing of the philosophical ideas of Fichte's time, or to become intimate with a beautiful spirit. He who reads it in the first way can easily miss the experience which he who reads it in the second way is sure to have The man Fichte impresses me as far greater than the peculiari- ties of his philosophy. I doubt if there are many thinkers today who and can take seriously Fichte's own development of doubt, knowledge, and belief. It sounds a little too immature and outmoded. Its social, scientific, and literary background is different from ours. Yet doubt knowledge, and belief remain. Human life is not yet rid of these three. 1 hey endure. Fichte wrestled with them to get a blessing. To illuminate them, he brought the best he knew and the best he could 81</page><page sequence="2">The American Scholar find. And he did illuminate them. He made them live. He chal- lenged men to busy themselves seriously and deeply with doubt, knowledge, and belief. He challenges them today, when he is read in the light of his purpose. Man's nature demands a commitment. A man may doubt as he pleases and know what he can; but to be a man involves something more. What do we look like? What do we look like when we observe ourselves and when, with an emancipated mind, we reflect on our journey in the noisy world and on our companions in that journey? These are questions for philosophy. They are also questions which every man asks who is not content to view his life as a senseless event in the world. He expects philosophy to give him light and leader- ship. What may be said then of the philosophy of the present day? I fear that it has until recently shown timidity when these questions are asked, and a three-fold timidity. First it has shown timidity when confronted with the belief in something supernatural in the nature of man. It is not necessary to- day to exhibit in detail the powerful influence which this belief has had on all branches of philosophy. It is sufficient to note that it has fixed the controlling terms which philosophy uses when it consid- ers what is peculiar in the nature of man. We discuss whether we are heavenly or earthly creatures. To find what is heavenly, we turn to religious doctrines or to the assertion that thinking itself puts man somehow in a position above nature. To find the earthly, we turn to the natural sciences. These alone should determine what we are to understand by nature. But the language of these sciences is not the language of the soul. Their words are not the words we use when we reflect on life and death. Yes; we discuss what we are. We rarely di- rectly and positively inquire. Philosophy, when busied about human- ity, is usually controversial. It should cease to be that. It should cease to waver between an idea of man and idea of nature which are op- posed to each other from the start. Is it really possible to believe that man is something which must be put into one or the other of two antecedently prepared worlds? Philosophy has also shown itself timid in the face of the positive sciences. We are accustomed to boast that these sciences are the great- est intellectual achievement of modern times. This they are beyond a doubt. But they are this because they are positive. They have taught 82</page><page sequence="3">The Nature of Man us that we can hope to find the laws of nature only as we are will- ing to be impartial towards events; and that the finding of the laws of nature puts us in a position to plan and enjoy with a purpose. The success of the positive sciences could easily raise the suspicion that philosophy itself should be equally positive. To be sure, there is a wide-spread positivism. It impresses me, however, as not strong enough, as not thoroughly positive, and as not relentlessly carried out. It regards human life, and particularly the life of the soul, in much the same way as any idealistic philosophy regards them. It sees in the soul a source of error and foolishness, the moment we regard the soul as a source of genuine information regarding the laws of nature. Idealistic philosophy, on the other hand, seems to be content with posing as an unanswerable criticism of positivism. This is easy, because it is obvious that we win knowledge and control of nature only through the exercise of the soul's activities. So for decades we have had systems of philosophy at war, and the war has always had a cautious eye directed towards the positive sciences. Both sides have been afraid of them. Positivism will do nothing to hurt them, and idealism will let them go their own way undisturbed and in isolation. Only about the beginning of the century has philosophy, with self- consciousness and energy, tried to become fully as independent and positive as the natural sciences. It has begun to be less fearful of what they have to say and to take them at their face-value. It will no longer allow that they alone determine either what man or what nature is. There is a third example of timidity. When I was a student in Berlin in the last century it was common to hear that psychology had become at last a positive and experimental science. Since that time psychology has made extraordinary progress. Its pace has been so rapid and its changes so dramatic, that one often wonders what will eventually become of it. Until recently the other sciences were con- tent to leave the study of the soul wholly to psychology. The soul lay beyond their territory. Psychology itself has changed this atti- tude. In its positive development it finds the need of physiology and physics. It turns to the study of animals, the apes and insects. It would become biological. It seeks help from the new biophysics and biochemistry. Its scope becomes constantly broader and its relations to other sciences increasingly closer. One result of this remarkable S3</page><page sequence="4">The American Scholar development is that psychology seems to have lost the human soul. Perhaps it would be better and more proper to say, that the soul has been progressively transformed, until it has at last become no more than the physiological, physical, and chemical behavior of human beings. We no longer have a soul or the soul is no longer a thing we can have. It is rather what we do, our activity as a whole. Philoso- phy has often regarded this progress of psychology as the progress of a lost son, although few psychologists seem anxious to return to the parental mansion. But we may well ask, has the effort of psy- chology to become an independent natural science been a gain or a loss for philosophy? Faced with this question philosophy seems to be timid. Only recently has it tried with a clear consciousness to see what it can make out of a man without a soul. It is natural to man to form opinions about the world and to try to orient his life within its boundaries. So philosophers have affirmed many times. The affirmation amounts to much more and has a deeper meaning than a justification of philosophy. It means that philosophy is in no need of justification at all. It needs a jus- tification as little as do the singing of birds, the blossoming of plants, or the velocity of light. Whatever is natural to anything in nature, is natural to it. In this respect all things and all procedures are equal. There is no privileged procedure. This we should have learned. As we learn it and value it, we gain a clear consciousness that philoso- phy is not an answer to the question, why is there a world with men in it, but an analysis of such a world, with basal emphasis on the fact that the world contains men for the same sort of reasons as it con- tains birds and plants and light. It holds them all together. There are not two worlds, to be played off against each other, one with men and one with all sorts of other things. I find it impossible to think that the world is divided into two the moment a man perceives it or thinks about it. If that were true, then I should have to believe that the world is so divided the moment the sun shines or an electron swings. I can not look upon the activity of man as an exception. Our philosophy should be wholly positive. I am not thinking of a revival of the positivism of the nineteenth century. I have already said, that kind of positivism was essentially a handmaid of the positive sciences. It was also the handmaid of cherished educational, social, and political theories. It was not inde- 84</page><page sequence="5">The Nature of Man pendent and free. It boasted that it looked upon man as a natural being, but when it was through with man's life it saw in all that is most characteristically human little more than visionary dreams, the natural sciences alone excepted. Man lost thereby his natural rights. Yet animals, plants, and atoms were left to go their natural way in the world. The demand that philosophy be positive calls for some- thing quite different. It is a demand for independence, freedom, and a release from timidity. That book of Fichte's closed with belief. We often ask, what should we believe? This is not, I think, as a first question, the ques- tion suited to the intellectual temper of the present. We have accus- tomed ourselves to disbelieve. We doubt, and even about knowledge itself. But why? That is the first question. The answer is not hard to find although it lies deep down in the history of the Western World. We hear of the decay of the Western World. But what is it that has really decayed? It is impossible to find in the whole history of the human race a century which can compare with ours in the mastery of those material forces and means which are the foundations on which a noble and brilliant civilization can be erected. Here there can be no thought of a decay. Here we stand on a height of which others have dreamed but which none has ever reached before. The suspicion of decay touches only our spirituality. Education, politics, morals, society, the give and take among men, and art itself - all exhibit nervousness, vacillation, and folly. They seem to have fallen into an extreme of confusion. They are not quickened and inspired by ideals like those - so many believe - that quickened our ancestors, even when they departed from them. It is hard, however, to believe that we are really worse men than our ancestors. The evidence may well point the other way. Yet it is not to be denied that daily there are fewer and fewer people who believe as our fathers believed. To have such a faith has become well-nigh impossible. The reason lies, not in a decay of human nature, but in the character of the history of the Western World. Our ancestors believed what they were taught to believe. They had to go to school, and to a school wherein they were not taught to consider their own experience and thereby gain ideas and ideals that were appropriate to it, but to a school in which they were taught the ideas and ideals of other peoples, ideas and ideals which had their 85</page><page sequence="6">The American Scholar source in a different civilization and were appropriate to a different experience. These alien ideas and ideals floated before their con- sciousness as the norms which should determine what their experi- ence ought to be. They ought to think like Greeks, plunder like Ro- mans, and pray like Christians. But they were themselves something different. Every now and then they became conscious of this, and then there was a revolution. The history of the Western World, in- tellectually considered, is the history of the education of new peoples, but an education which would compel them to think and to feel like the peoples of a foreign world, and which through this compulsion sowed the seeds of revolution. The current opposition between old and new is not the ordinary opposition between parents and children but something much deeper. It is the opposition between a tradition of foreign origin and the desire to be oneself. The Western World takes no delight in speaking Latin ; it prefers to speak its own lan- guages. It would lead its own life. It does not seem strange, therefore, that today we would rather free ourselves from history than learn from it. It is not strange that we have become so unsettled and vacil- lating. We will have our own experience. But who knows what that experience is or should be? What should we believe? The answer can still wait a little. What should we not believe if we would really learn something from our history? When I consider the results of the historical criticism of human opinions, philosophical, religious, or otherwise, and also the results of positive inquiry into natural events, I am compelled to conclude that we should not believe that man is an exception in the natural history of the world. He comes from nature and to nature he returns. He comes and he goes like any other event in the world; and the world exists for his sake as little as it exists for the sake of anything else. We should not believe differently. There are many who will believe differently. But they will to believe; and the "will to be- lieve," although it may often be a comfort, is not an attitude which is intellectually grounded. I would not fight about words. A philoso- pher like William James, for example, may hold that all knowledge is at bottom a belief, but the distinction between what is believable and what is not believable remains. What I would affirm is this« in sible the face of all our discoveries, it has become intellectually impos- sible to believe that man is not a natural being in the same sense as 86</page><page sequence="7">The Nature of Man animals, plants, and atoms. We may put this unbelievable thing away in the interest of hopes and fears, but we cannot think it away when we thoughtfully and purposefully plan for our daily life. This negative attitude should be transformed into a positive atti- tude. It is not enough to believe that we are not otherwise than we are. We should believe that we really are what we are. The develop- ment of a thoroughly naturalistic philosophy seems to me to be es- sential if philosophy is to point out to modern men what the love of wisdom really means. Naturalism is becoming daily more popular. This fact, however, witnesses neither to its truth nor its solidity. It witnesses rather to the profound impression which the results of mod- ern criticism and research have made upon modern living and popu- lar thinking. What we call "modern" is no longer a matter of lit- erary or artistic eccentricity. It is a spirit which has permeated the whole of our social, moral, economic, and religious life. The new is sought, the old is discarded. We repeatedly hear that the age-long in- stitutions of mankind are no longer suited to the needs of the day. They have confined and repressed the natural desires and enjoyments of men, although it is only with the fulfilment of desire that life finds satisfaction. Naturalism is becoming increasingly popular. It is, however, rarely confident and relentlessly carried out. With us it is a young philosophy and often youthful. It exhibits excitement rather than depth. The bonds of tradition and authority fall away and there comes a sense of freedom which would let every man lead his life as he pleases. It demands social, moral, and economic ar- rangements which will insure favorable opportunities for living. Yes, insurance of living is what is demanded, and even government is expected to provide it. There is little serious thought about the ques- tion. What does it really mean to be a child of nature? What is the nature of man? Few philosophers and still fewer psychologists have attained a clear knowledge of the fact that this incorporation of man into na- ture is of the greatest metaphysical significance. They seem to be content with the conclusion that something thereby has happened to man. He has been changed. His relatives have been changed. He is no longer a child of God and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven His once high position in the cosmos has been abased. His relatives have become the animals, the plants, and the atoms, and this is taken</page><page sequence="8">The American Scholar to mean that the nature of man is to be found at last in the nature of the atom. There are a few who can find in Heisenberg^ principle of indeterminism the hope that there is yet a Promethean spark of free- dom in the world, but beyond this the incorporation of man into na- ture is a profound transformation of what he is, a change of his des- tiny and his relationships. The popular attitude agrees with this conclusion. It is thought that naturalism gives to men chiefly their animal rights. Man has become an animal. His intelligence is only an instrument of his animal life to be used to find channels through which his natural impulses may healthfully and freely flow. This is what both the followers and the opponents of naturalism usually affirm. In this affirmation the former find joy and hope, and the latter shame and destruction. Shall we, however, make haste to become either followers or op- ponents? It is still possible, even in these revolutionary times, to find an hour for a little deeper reflection on the whole matter. The cur- rent conclusion from naturalism is not the only conclusion, and per- haps not the most correct, that may be drawn. The incorporation of man into nature may well do something to man, but it must also do something to nature. It is impossible that the word "nature" can mean the same after this incorporation that it meant before. The in- corporation is really revolutionary. It does not permit us to think of nature as if it were wholly predetermined, irrespective of man's in- corporation into it. What has naturalism really done to man? It has most certainly changed him. But how? It has changed him from an illustration of what nature is not, to a profound illustration of what nature is. He reveals what nature is fully as much as any other nat- ural event. The nature of man and the nature of nature go together. This truth is the lesson taught by the whole history of philosophy. Thinking about man and thinking about nature have always gone together. In the history of thought, nature and man have always formed either an opposition or a unity. When they are opposed, then it is obvious that the nature of man cannot be found in the nature of nature. When they are not opposed, then it is equally obvious that what nature is, is closely and basically bound up with what man is 1 he failure to recognize this, or the fear of the consequences of rec- ognizing it, has been responsible in large measure for the vacillations and folhes of naturalism. Otherwise how could it be possible for any 88</page><page sequence="9">The Nature of Man one to believe that animals, plants, and atoms are better and more im- portant examples of what nature really is than man himself? How could naturalism be looked upon as a debasement of man and not an elevation of nature? How could so many naturalists believe that physics and chemistry, rather than metaphysics, reveal nature's char- acter? I must affirm that the incorporation of man into nature restores metaphysics to freedom, independence, and confidence. It regains its position as the primary discipline which lies at the basis of any re- flective consideration of existence. The nature of man and the nature of nature go together. A thor- ough-going naturalism will not separate them. It will not allow us to think of nature as something first created or first discovered, and then man added to introduce confusion. It forbids the myth of creation and also that substitute for it, which is so often constructed on the foundations of what we call the natural sciences. Since there are men and atoms, nature can be no more adequately defined without men than it can be without atoms. Man himself discloses the kind of na- ture in which atoms can exist fully as much as atoms disclose the kind of nature in which man can exist. A naturalistic philosophy should not think of nature as something first created or first defined which only tolerates the existence of man in some mysterious manner. Does nature tolerate the atoms; or the vegetables; or the birds? Such questions are absurd. For nature is equally tolerant of everything that happens and everything that happens is equally tolerant of her. And that means that she cannot be something first created or first found, to be followed by whatever happens. She is something quite differ- ent. She is what events together disclose in their mutual relations to one another - activity illustrating law. Man explains nature only in the sense that he discovers her, and he discovers her only as a conse- quence of the fact that his whole life from birth to death, from walk- ing to thinking, is a genuine co-working with what she is. The ques- tion why and how man lives, how and why he walks and thinks, is, in principle, the same sort of question as why and how the atoms move. This does not mean that the movement of atoms is the think- ing of a man, or that thinking is some curious addition to motion, but that both motion and thinking are a co- working with nature under controlling laws. A thorough naturalism may not think of something already prepared for the happening of events. It demands not only 89</page><page sequence="10">The American Scholar an emancipation from a traditional conception of man; it demands also an emancipation from a traditional conception of nature. I hope I have now made clear my own attitude towards naturalism. When I speak of my own attitude, I do not think of a personal dis- covery. I mean the attitude to which I have been led by the study of the history of philosophy and the movements of thought in our time. Naturalism is a discovery with me only in the sense that it impresses me as the philosophy which thinking men would gladly accept if only they could believe it. We do not like to look upon nature as our enemy. Our daily life seems so obviously to be an opportunity to ac- complish something lasting and worth while; and life is the only thing we know that seems to offer such an opportunity. This is fact. It is not speculation or a dream. It is not even a belief. It is fact. Be- lief arises only when we reflect on the fact and wonder whether it forces us to break the world in two. Two, we would rather not have. It is our errors, our difficulties, our embarrassments, which incline us to divide the world. Yet without these we could not be co-workers with nature. Without them possibilities would be impossible. I would not admit a division; I would believe in a unity. I must believe that nature reveals herself in man more adequately than in anything else; that in him her laws come to expression and meaning; that human life is not set over against nature but is nature illuminated and in- spirited. And then I turn again to history. Naturalism is not an historically new philosophy. The modern kind is new only in the sense that it is not founded on the naturalisms of the past but is a product of modern science, modern psychology, modern criticism, and the technological demands of modern life. It is a challenge to us to revolutionize our traditional thinking. The first consequence is not surprising. Man feels himself changed. He asks what he has lost and what he has gained. He does not first ask what nature has lost and what she has gained. But it is just this question which he must ask at last. Then he may well turn to history. Then he may find a genuine interest in the naturalisms of the past. I select from the nature philosophies of the past, and particularly from that of Aristotle, a principle to emphasize. I would call it the principle of propriety. In his exposition of nature as something dy- namic and progressive Aristotle used two principles which have pro- foundly influenced subsequent thinking, the principle of natural pro- 90</page><page sequence="11">The Nature of Man powers and the principle of natural proprieties. We usually think that the principle of the conservation of energy has freed us from the first. I doubt that we are right but this may be left here uncon- sidered. To the principle of proprieties we still hold. On it depends the discovery of the lawfulness of nature. Or I would rather say that it is the discovery of proprieties which leads us to the formulation of the laws of nature. We seek everywhere for what is peculiar or proper to the operations of things. When we find it we formulate a law. I doubt that examples are necessary. Perhaps it is enough to say that we try to find, not any velocity, but the proper velocity of light, which can be held to be constant when we formulate the laws of what we observe. On the discovery of this proper velocity much depends. Determinations or characteristics like this together make up the propriety of nature. We might therefore define nature as a realm or sphere or even an assemblage of proprieties. I prefer the world "realm," not because it is poetic and suggests a government, although these are good reasons enough, but because it carries with it all that law implies. When, however, I define nature as such a realm, I do not imply that nature was once upon a time ideologically arranged. I am fond of teleology but not of a teleology of that sort. Teleology is what the events of nature reveal and without it these events would not be intelligible to us. We understand a thing when we have discovered what it can do in relation to other things. In different relations it acts differently but in every case with a definiteness in accord with its propriety. Its opera- tion in specific cases is a specific operation which none the less illus- trates its proper action. If this is not teleology I wonder what teleology can be. In this kind of teleology we find the usefulness and usability of things; and the source of these characters is not in us but in the proprieties of nature. Now what have these observations, which are for the most part obvious and naïve, to do with man and the nature; of man? Much I believe. Guided by the philosophy of naturalism we have incorpo- rated man wholly within nature. This now means, that with respect to human life there is propriety in nature fully as much as in any other instance. Man, from his lowest physiological functions to the highest aspirations of his thought, illustrates the propriety of nature. The world in which he lives is controlled not only by physical and Ci</page><page sequence="12">The American Scholar chemical laws; it is controlled also by logical, moral, and spiritual laws. Otherwise how could man doubt or know or believe? When a man walks, we readily admit that nature is appropriate to his walk- ing. When he sees or thinks, should we say something different? Should we say something different even when he prays? He is doing what is natural. A thoroughgoing naturalism can not avoid the con- clusion that nature is as adapted to the life of man as it is to animals, plants, and atoms. To be so adapted nature must be so arranged and ordered that the spiritual life of man is not alien to her. The nature of man and the nature of nature coincide. It seems possible, therefore, that philosophy can develop a valid positivism, a valid realism, a valid naturalism, which will teach that the world does not exist for other purposes than its own. It exists as something to be experienced in order to discover the possibilities its existence offers. Metaphysically considered, the world is very much like what children, poets, and the man in the street take it to be- - something out of which something can be made; and to make some- thing out of it is what everything in it seems bent on doing, from atoms to man. Nature is not a creation but the challenge and the op- portunity to create. She is the enemy of nothing. She is like a God who loves all his children equally in order to show his love unequal only as the impulse to create extends wider and wider. We may well remember the words of Aristotle: "Even the stone would become a doorstep; and all things strive after the divine." Such a philosophy may be lightly dismissed as childish and poetic. But there are children and poets in the world as well as hydrogen. It may be condemned as anthropomorphic. Old Xenophanes is cred- ited with the remark: "If oxen and lions had hands and could paint, oxen would paint gods as oxen, and lions, as lions." He forgot the important matter; namely, that neither oxen nor lions have hands. They do not paint. He who has hands and can paint is a man. And who dares affirm that oxen and lions exist in order to cheapen men? This is childish and poetic philosophy of that kind which has always quickened and inspirited the strivings of men. And I often wonder why some of us seem to be uncomfortable when confronted with the childlike and poetic. It is not, however, because this philosophy is childlike and poetic that I turn to it. It is because it impresses me as grounded in the nature of things. What I have here expressed in 92</page><page sequence="13">The Nature of Man poetic language could also be expressed in language which would sound scientific. But the language which sounds scientific does not reach to the full extent of man's nature. The birds can be scientifically- analyzed. Still they sing. They are machines, if we will} but they are singing machines, and he who forgets the singing has not discovered what birds naturally and really are. I believe that naturalism is a good philosophy for mankind. To have a philosophy of some sort belongs to the nature of man. When, however, we consider the leading nations and peoples of the present world, what do we find? Do they see eye to eye? Are they at one in the desire to honor man and to care for him? Have they the same respect for him as they have for chemistry? Has the modern world a vision, like that of Christendom, which can inspire men even when they depart from it and sin against it? Perhaps some will say, yes. There is democracy, there is socialism, there is communism, there is capitalism, there is fascism. But what do these names name? Surely not ideals of human life but different methods of administration. There is no doubt that our happiness and well-being are bound up with methods of administration, but there is also no doubt that the successful carrying through of any method depends, not on its char- acter, but on the character of its administrators. Communism as well as capitalism can ruin mankind. One cannot overlook the fact that the modern world cries to heaven for a strong, orderly, and wise ad- ministration. With that which is current we have not gone very far. We are suffering from eccentricities, fears, and egotisms. We are suffering from the common human failing of blaming others for our own negligence. Mankind always suffers when it has neither a re- ligion nor a philosophy to quicken and inspire. Das Wahre war schon längst gefunden, Hat edle Geisterschaft verbunden, Das alte Wahre, fass es an. Yes, we suffer from administration and from conditions which are socially, politically, and economically extraordinarily complicated. But who can be so foolish as to believe that any administration can be invented which will automatically free men once for all from suf- fering? We must hold fast to the old truth. Human salvation lies in inspiration, in a conception of the nature of man, which rises above 93</page><page sequence="14">The American Scholar his daily life to become its ideal and its judge. Man must see some- thing in the sky which illuminates his earthly pilgrimage and criti- cizes it. What can a man see in the sky? A naturalistic philosophy should teach that he can see all that the astronomer sees through his tele- scope and elaborates with the help of mathematics. But that is not all. He can also see how the sky affects his sensibility - the impression of infinity upon infinity, the consequent lifting and humbling of his spirit, the impulse to reflect and reflect until he feels himself incor- porated in the whole, the consequent awakening in him of the sus- picion that his life is committed, committed to possibilities which reach far beyond his daily joys and sorrows, hopes and fears - he can see that it is this kind of seeing that makes him a man and reveals to him what it really means to live with other men and to live with na- ture. Looking through a telescope is not the only valid experience which nature allows. Spiritual experience is also an experience of nature, and it is this experience alone which quickens and inspires living. So should naturalism teach when it tries to be a philosophical guide to mankind. Perhaps I should say something about the practical applications of a philosophy like this. But I have thought that on this occasion an expression of my philosophical point of view would be expected. I can bring this together in a sentence: It has become impossible for me to believe that a world in which perceiving and thinking and longing actually exist as facts can be a world which must be philo- sophically divided because these facts exist in it. So far as practice is concerned I will emphasize only the obvious. We should learn from what our experience of nature is. That is our duty. It is a real duty because our inclination is to have experiences instead of learning from them. Really to learn involves the setting aside of what is visionary or deceptive or only egotistical. It involves the sustained criticism of life in the presence of life's emergencies. I venture to use the war as the best example that could today be chosen. With good reasons we speak of it as the World War. That means something far deeper than the fact that nearly all the peoples of the world became involved in it. It means that through the war we have all had a profound common experience which should teach us some- thing about the needs of the modern man. Historians may search for 94</page><page sequence="15">The Nature of Man the causes of the war. That is undoubtedly interesting and important. But what the war has to teach does not depend upon its causes. Causes concern its beginning but not its end. In 1 9 1 4 the observer asked who started the war and why; who would be victor and what the victor would gain? In 191 8 where were observers to be found? Then the question was: To what purpose? The nations feared not only each other; they were afraid of themselves. How could this terrible dis- ease be brought to an end? How could the exhausted nations recover? Such were the great questions. They remain the great questions still. When they are forgotten the terrible disease again threatens. To be sure the war revealed the rivalry and self-seeking of the nations, but there was no need of a war to reveal that. That we knew well enough without seeking a proof of it. The important thing which the war re- vealed was that rivalry and self-seeking of nations are things unsuited to modern times and to modern life. The war showed that they are antiquated. Against them are arrayed the forces of our time which are daily growing and which will control in the end. That dreadful and common experience has demonstrated that the claims of men have passed far beyond the claims of nations, and that the nations must change their mode of thinking if they are to save and to serve the modern world. This is easy to say and it is often said. Men have dreamed long ago of a parliament of the world, but it has been of a parliament that they have dreamed. Is it really longer possible to believe that a par- liament like those of the past is entirely suited to our needs? If we would learn from the experience of the war and from its conse- quences, we should begin with men. We should go from the home to the nation and not from the nation to the home. I do not doubt that questions of national boundaries, national armies, national navies, and national security are weighty questions, but I doubt much more whether these are the questions with which the modern world should begin or which concern its permanent good. We are afraid of an- other war. But is it not worth while to ask whether it is not really dangerous to let the opposition between war and peace be the deter- mining principle of our thinking and planning? Shall we discuss the carrying of guns when we sit around a table? We should think of other things, of labor, of business, of education, of the nature of man. What advantage does the modern world get from victory or defeat? 95</page><page sequence="16">The American Scholar The victors may easily go to ruin and the defeated become a sore. The war has clearly shown that labor, business, and education are the things on which the welfare of the modern world depends. These are the things which are determining more and more the internal and external policy of the nations. The history of mankind has brought us to this position, and the war has made this movement of history clear. It was a terrible experience, but it ought not to be profitless to have had it. We should not think in terms of having it again but in terms of its lessons. This is what philosophy should teach. But it should be taught inspired by an ideal of human life, which like a vision will reveal that labor, business, and education are good be- cause through them man comes nearer to what he calls divine. And to be divine is not to conquer other men or even nature. It is to honor both. A new world - that we would gladly have. The forces of our time are bent on having it. These forces have their source, not in political theories, but in the occupations and needs of human life. Mankind will have a new world. Its will is set upon this with increasing clear- ness and increasing power. But what kind of a new world? Shall philosophy sit still and leave mankind to be enticed by all sorts of administrative theories, theories which encourage the hope that, through their adoption, we shall automatically come to happiness and salvation? Shall philosophy not rather teach that no administra- tion can be successful if it is not inspired by a consciousness of the natural destiny of man which reveals that human life is a commit- ment, that nature has so determined it because she has disclosed in man what can be made out of her adaptability? In man she has re- vealed what her forces can accomplish ; in him she has become vis- ible; in him she has become knowable; in him she has awakened the desire to bring his life to a consummation which justifies itself and over which a God might rejoice. In him she has fostered the belief that life itself is a demand and a need of nature. These are the foun- dations on which philosophy should build. What should we believe? The voice of Fichte still speaks. It sum- mons us to consider our character and our destiny, and to believe that these can never be divorced from the character and destiny of nature at large. They go together; and in the hearty acceptance of their go- ing together is to be found the quickening of the human spirit. 96</page></plain_text>
