<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTES ARNOBIUS OF SICCA. The Case against the Pagans (Adversus nationes). Translated and annotated by GEORGE E. MCCRACKEN. 2 vols. ("Ancient Christian Writers," Nos. 7 and 8.) Westminster, Md.: Newman Press, I949. 659 pages. Vol. I, $3.50; Vol. II, $3.25. Translated into English only once before ("Ante- Nicene Christian Library"; reprinted with additions in "Ante-Nicene Fathers," Vol. VI), this excellent production (Nos. 7 and 8 in the "Ancient Christian Writers" series) at times makes even Arnobius live again. His treatise raises almost innumerable and unanswerable questions: "When did he live?" "Who was he?" "What was his connection with Lactanti- us?" "What sort of Christian was the author of the case against the pagans?" The treatise, probably composed in the first dec- ade of the fourth century, defends Christianity against (i) those who accuse it of causing the pres- ent calamities of the world; (2) those who ridicule the Christians' worship of a crucified human being; and (3) those who attack the Christian Scriptures for their nonclassical style. Book ii attacks Greek philosophy and defends Christian antiquity, though Arnobius also holds to the mortality of the soul (!). Books iii-vii attack the anthropomorphism of the ancient beliefs and their symbols: the temples, images, sacrifices, and ceremonials. The chief question raised in my mind in reading Arnobius is: "How many people still believed in the ancient gods and goddesses at the beginning of the fourth century? Is Arnobius raising here a man of straw?" If we are to believe our author, these pagan beliefs were widely held and greatly influential at this time. One ought also to ask, secondarily: "What kind of Christian was Arnobius?" We are indebted to the editors of the "Ancient Christian Writers," Johannes Quasten and Joseph C. Plumpe, and to the translator, George E. McCracken, for this fresh presentation of Arnobius' seven books. An informative Introduction precedes the translation, and the work is well annotated in scholarly fashion throughout.-MERVIN M. DEEMS. BIEDER, WERNER.

Bieder's book is a part of the series of "Abhand- lungen zur Theologie des Alten und Neuen Testa- ments," edited by Eichrodt and Cullmann. It is a very thorough study of the rise and spread of the early Christian belief in Christ's descent into Hades. The author finds that in the New Testament there are references only to a transitorisch descent into Hades; the belief in Christ's purposeful descent arises in the second century because of concern for the dead, the missionary motif, the weakness of faith which finds it must add descensus to cross and resur- rection, and the influence of other religions. He points out that I Peter does not speak of a descent and argues that the "dead" of I Pet. 4:6 are the "spiritually dead." The motivation of Bieder's book seems to be the desire to eliminate the descent into Hades from the creed; he proposes to substitute the more "biblical" appearance to angels found in I Tim. 3: i6. We may question whether such a substitution would possess any value except for those persons who (a) accepted all of Bieder's argument (which is somewhat confus- ing, since at one point he seems to admit that the descensus is actually found in I Peter [p. I98]) and (b) insisted upon a literally biblical phrase for use in the creed. In his actual handling of the question his observa- tions are often acute and always thorough, although his arrangement of the material leaves something to be desired. We may ask whether he lays enough emphasis on the human values to be found in the descensus belief and expressed in other religions of the Hellenistic-Roman world. He rejects speculative theology and the universalism which grows out of it. This rejection necessarily makes his treatment some- what one-sided.-ROBERT M. GRANT. CULLMANN, OSCAR.

The only difference between this second edition of Cullmann's important treatise and the first is the price. The first edition was critically reviewed in this Journal in April, I947 (Vol. XXVII, No. 2). Suffice it to say that the author in answering four questions -(i) Why did the early Christians have need of a rule of faith? (2) What circumstances produced this necessity? (3) What was the form of the first for- mulas and how did they evolve? (4) What was the epitome of Christian faith according to these early formulas?-discovers the bases of the later creeds in significant passages of the New Testament (cf. I Cor. 8:6, 15:3; Eph. 4:4; I Tim. 6:13; Philemon 2:6; I Pet. 3: i8). The core of early belief and confes- sion is that Christ is Lord. Certain influences ac- count for the development of early creeds: baptism and the catechumenate, formal worship, exorcism, persecution, and defense against heresy. I46</page></plain_text>
