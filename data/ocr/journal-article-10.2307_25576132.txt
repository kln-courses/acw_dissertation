(No price marked) The limitations of Hewitt's poems are obvious; his language is niggardly in its vocabulary and his rhythms are monotonous as well as lacking in variety, and his espousal of Regionalism in the nineteen-forties left an ineradicable mark, so that even his little pamphlet of travel pieces, Tesserae (1967), contrives to turn foreign places into aspects of Ulster, bedecked with the alien colours of the Mediterranean. The editor of his selected poems is a little too anxious to suggest that the poetry has the virtues of its limitations and writes: 'There is often a deliberate plainness in the language he uses that has misled some readers into thinking him dull and prosaic, lack ing in colour. . . sometimes the quiet unemphatic tone conceals reserves of power'. The truth of the matter is that Hewitt is a competent artificer; he never falls below a certain level, but he never rises to unquestioned heights. His most considerable monu ment to date is his Collected Poems 1932-1967 whose chronological arrangement makes it clear that he is not just a nature poet but also 'by birth, an Irishman of Planter stock, by profession an art gallery man, politically a man of the Left'. To read through it is like watching the slow erection of a drystone wall; the stones, of the same kind, but all of different sizes, are put together with spalls in the interstices, and what calls attention is not this or that stone but the wall, [41]</page><page sequence="2">not gaudy nor pretentious, but built to submit to the weathering of time and not easily collapse. Dr Warner's selection does the poet a disservice, dividing the poems into four sections according to theme regardless of chronology and prefacing each section with totally unnecessary remarks such as: 'Although John Hewitt was bom and brought up in the streets of Belfast, he has a deep love of the countryside and he is a keen observer of country scenes and country people. . . ' At least one of the poems in Mosaic was written thirty years ago, others are of more recent date, but one would be hard put to distinguish between Hewitt aged forty-four and Hewitt aged seventy-four. He remains a shrewd and isolated observer of worlds to which he can never belong, and the wish to belong remains the dominant emotional force in his writing. A man who has said that he is firstly an Ulsterman, of planter stock, secondly an Irishman, thirdly British, and fourthly a European, must despair at the apparent polar isation of opinion in Northern Ireland into Green and Orange sectarianism. This makes all the more poignant a poem such as 'The Covenanter's Grave'. One day they argued whence their family name and quizzed their father. 'Ayrshire', he replied; 'three hundred years ago a preacher came to plant us in the Antrim countryside; his grave's at Donegore.' The elder son wondered aloud if there'd still be a trace - that name - his name - upon some lettered stone - to show that he had found the proper place. He travelled there, and in the churchyard sought among the stones, aware that someone stared, a woman from that house beyond the gate. Her peremptory challenge proudly brought the name for which he searched, deliberate. 'Youse were a long time comin',' she declared. * The Poet's Circuits 'reproduces, with amendments, the type setting of the 1960 edition, by permission of the Oxford University Press' and illustrates a sad decline in the standards of book production we have come to associate with the Dolmen Press. The photographic process has blurred the out lines of the letters so that the typeface appears thicker than it [42]</page><page sequence="3">should and the proportions of the page are spoilt, the text, consequently, being much less pleasant to read. The elegant printer's device used to ornament the title page of each 'circuit' has been omitted: I have not noticed any other 'amendments'. Though both Colum and Hewitt describe a rural life that is rapidly vanishing - in a hundred years time their swatches of iambic pentameter may well seem equally quaint and equally prosaic - Colum has a gift denied to Hewitt, the gift of song. His best poetry is that written to song metres and his versions of songs in Irish. Both are to be found in his first book of poems, Wild Earth (1907) and though he was to write much more he cannot be said to have written much better. Such poems as 'A Drover', 'A Poet Scholar of the Forties', 'An Old Woman of the Roads' and 'A Cradle Song' - 'O, men from the fields' -, though out of fashion now, are irreplaceable. Colum was a man born out of his time and The Poet's Circuits is spoilt by an excess of nostalgia. He never accepted the modern world instinctually, only intellectually, and his many retellings of myths and folktales from Norway to Hawaii, a valuable and welcome corrective to the materialistic bases of so much of our thought, are not the least important part of his work, as those fortunate enough to have read them at the right age will know. Born a hundred years earlier, in 1781, Colum might have been a beloved folk-singer, a gentler Raftery; born when he was, he made an attempt to carry on an old tradition into the twentieth century and failed, but not without leaving many sweet and simple utter ances as he circuited Ireland and the United States. Such a song as the following, with its repetitions and variations finds its closest parallel in the thirteenth century Galician Portugese cantigas de amigo: Levad', amigo que dormides as manhanas frias: toda-las aves do mundo d'amor dizian. Leda m' and' eu . . . (Arise, friend who sleeps on cold mornings: all the birds of the world are speaking of love. I am glad to depart). Here is Colum's poem: You would not slumber If laid at my breast: You would not slumber. [43]</page><page sequence="4">The river flood beats The swan from her nest You would not slumber. Little sister, I'll rock you to rest. Times without number Has cooed the woodquest: Times without number. As oft as she cooed To me you were pressed: Times without number. Now you'd not slumber If laid at my breast Times without number. 0 starling reed-resting. I'll rock you to rest: So you will slumber. Poets do not wish to write like that anymore, and might not be able; the world has changed, and the word 'woodquest' is not as widely known as it was * ,: 0~~~~ Eil&amp;an Ni ChuilleanAin's latest collection contains the poems from her sequence 'Cork', written to accompany drawings of that city by Brian Lalor, an eighteen poem sequence called 'The Rose Geranium', and five other poems. In her world the dividing line: between dream and waking, between memory and imagination, is indistinct and impalpable for she des cribes the two :states with an equal attention and an equal accuracy of image; it is as if she were always by a wndow, preferably at twilight when the light plays tricks with our eyes: In my dream I: feel the shock: of waking: By the pillow, shadows of high branches, Black rindand pale flower Are signals from a garden drowned behind glass... There are at least twenty references to windows and eight to mirrors or reflections; she is both on the inside looking out and on the outside looking i ad sometimes the mior is [441Ai e</page><page sequence="5">empty. There are no reliable coordinates in these refracted lands, but the light shed by the words and by the images they comprehend makes each point unnaturally clear. In a poem teasingly headed with a quotation from Marvell about God's bounty, 'He hangs in shades the Orange Bright' she writes: So quiet the girl in the room he says It is a precarious bowl Of piled white eggs on a high shelf. Against the dark wardrobe the gleam Of skin and the damp hair inclining Over her leaning shoulder fades Into dark. She leans on a hand Clutching the bedrail, her breasts pale Askew as she stands looking left Past the window towards the bright glass. But from the window it is clear That the dark glass reflects nothing; Brilliance of the water-bottle Spots the ceiling. The man in the courtyard waters the roots of the trees And birds in their cages high on the red wall sing. She moves her head and sees The window tall on hinges Each oblong tightly veiled. One side admits Air through a grey slatted shutter, and light Floats to the ceiling's Profound white lake. Still the sound of water and the stripe Of blue sky and red wall, Dark green leaves and fruit, one ripe orange she says The sheet lightning over the mountains As I drove over the quiet plain Past the dark orange-groves. Each point of interest momentarily holds our attention -the white eggs, the gleaming skin, the water-bottle, the man who waters, the red wall, the window, the blue sky, the sheet [45]</page><page sequence="6">lightning - but can they be added up to a meaning? If the poem were a picture, and there is no doubt but that Eiltan Ni Chuillenain is highly skilled at making pictures with words, one would not persist in asking questions about meaning, but words are less tractable than colours or shapes. One may well wonder who are the figures in a picture by Balthus and why are they there, but one is finally content with the formal values that express this painter's sensuality. I would be con tent with 'He Hangs in Shades the Orange Bright' and with many another poem in this book which concerns itself with the play of light and shade if they were pictures, but the words have lives that are not wholly contained in the poem and pose unanswerable questions. It may not matter who 'he' and 'she' are, but what is the relationship between them, if any? How is the glass dark and bright and if it reflects nothing, is there nothing to reflect? To whom are he and she saying what ever it is they say - to the 'I' who drove over the quiet plain or to themselves? Is the sheet lightning merely adventitious or a symbol of emotional backgrounds? Do the water and the colours and the fruit still remain only for the 'she' who says or for others? Does the poem say that bright ness depends on shadows or does it say more? That a poem should contain an irreducible nucleus of mystery is good; that it should seem worthwhile to ask such questions is good; but to ask too many questions too often makes the reader tire of the twilight, of the shadow cast by the rose-geranium, of the vivid apprehension of the momen tary insight. More than most this is a private poetry, to be read with delight for its handling of JJanguage, but in the consciousness that one is outside the window, looking in. John F. Deane has neither the skill nor the assurance of Eilean Ni ChuilleanAin. HEs first book, Stalking After Time (Profile Press 1977), exhibited an unfocused energy and a confused mixture of styles from the unadventurous and conventional lines: And then I held the Church against my ear listening to the murmur of the traffic sea At once prayer ceased. Beyond silent benches the altar was a song of flowers, an orchestra of lights and candelabra . . where something could have been done to develop the image of the Church as a shell but the opportunity was not taken; to the modemistic bravado of:: . .~~~46</page><page sequence="7">articulated lorries rain scurrying I remember from all that confusion head lights full on I remember how you tumed I have to time it carefully in the rush leave 20 after 8 arrive 5 before 9 how you . . . High Sacrifice is more controlled and marks an advance, but the language is flaccid and there is a superfluity of words. The incidents or anecdotes which give rise to the poems are more memorable than the poems themselves, which is putting the cart before the horse. A dead shark found lying on the shore is a good subject for a poem; the shark, once a 'Pale ravener of horrible meat' as Melville called him in his poem 'The Maldive Shark', becomes his own charnel house. Here is the first part of 'Sea-smell'; On mud, here in our backwater, when tide seeped away a while, I found a blue shark beached in death's abject flabbiness; that such stem royalty should sicken in shallow estuaries, along tin-can shorelines, seemed obscenity. Gulls had begun essential scavenging towards life's fearful symmetry: The prosaic opening is an inadequate preparation for the in sensitive use of the word 'abject' in the feeble phrase 'death's abject flabbiness'; the anthropomorphism of 'stem royalty' cannot make the scene obscene, even with the help of 'tin can shorelines'. Surely we do not have to be told that scavenging is essential? and the misuse of Blake's words is a lapse of taste, if not as clumsy as the last verse which refers to: ... need to grasp this universe, swallow as if it were fleshed sex of woman wholly down within but see! we blush and nod, stalk concrete streets of our estates, hating grass in cracks, glad to turn a key in the small front door. Mr Deane's intention is presumably to put our petty urban concerns into proportion by contrasting them with the enormous indifference of nature, but the grandeur of such themes is not suited to his pen, which is more at home in the plain and unassuming. A memory of childhood in Achill: . . . High on a knot of branches I built my house of wood, nailed it to the bark; drops of resin hardened into pearls. I sat for hours ... [47]</page><page sequence="8">is spoilt when it becomes self-consciously literary and grandiose: * . . I was delegate to the conference of elements until at dusk the rook armadas came noisily around me ... The title poem of the book, which is about Robert Emmet, has its most successful passage where it avoids the drama and quietly suggests that Emmet was not so much the leader as the led: You say it was I who shouted and stood out to take the lead? not so; if I but whispered the room fell silent, made my words a boast, if I laughed it was a threat, and if I loved I was a patriot, my song a proclamation ... The quiet suggestion and the straightforward statement are not enough for the author; he must force a significance on to his poems that his verbal ability is unable to sustain, that the quality of his language is not equal to. Nuala Archer writes with that confidence that is often attri buted to youth and that youth rarely possesses. Perhaps it is something to do with being born in America of Irish parents: she brings a welcome vigour into the world of Irish poetry, still overcast by inherited tradition and waiting for the clouds to thin. She can even take the proverbial theme of time as a black ox, used by Walter Scott and W.B. Yeats, and make it new:, She plows through fields of Greece and Rome. She plows copper rain and blue snow into the ground. :She plows' pinwheels of children, cows 0; . and hay-filled barns into the ground. Her muddy feet spel: a mosaic of disappearance. The i ninite black box giltters under, hr. She plots the release of Persephone and listens to wind publishing her marrow. The quality of her attention to:Mwords is: exemplary and her use of metaphor revivifi the myth. Hopkins wrote that'there livesH the deat frshness deep [48]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="9">down things'; it is Nuala Archer's gift that she brings this freshness to the surface so that we are induced to see the world again with a childlike eye, to accept the extraordinary nature of existence and eve, at times to laugh at it. Snow melts to make us sailors. Our houses flota free and knock against each other like sampans. Whale on the Line has such vivacity, such inexhaustible invention and such delicacy that it has given me unalloyed pleasure. The title poem is an imaginative tour-de-force about a whale trapped in the Atlantic cables; it is at once an extra ordinarily vivid reconstruction of a submarine world, a re minder of mortality, a love poem and an exploration of imaginative possibilities. For months words drift in shoals around the quiet whale . . . 'Remember nightingales, stars, hibiscus, the late train, willows of wind ... ? That is not the best verse, but it indicates how full advantage has been taken of the pun in the title. The best part of Peter O'Leary's book is the didication: For Greece its mountains its seas its people for he has not succeeded in turning his love and admiration into poetry. This one-liner is not the worst of them: Olive trees: old women of the hills in green shawls. . The diction is in general spongy and dated; only the lack of regular forms indicates that we are in the ninth decade of the twentieth century. Douglas Sealy [49]</page></plain_text>
