STUKEY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO According to the prevailing opinion, ceremonial purity in Greek religion consists in the absence of harmful supernatural forces. On the basis of the classical evidence, however, the impure cannot be identified with the harmful in general, nor even with that that is injurious to man in his relation to the divine. A study of the vocabulary of catharsis suggests that the essence of purity is a resemblance to holiness and cleanness. This inference is confirmed by the fact that impurity is nearly always a corruption of a good religious state by bodily change or contact. Three quarters of a century ago, Edward Tylor suggested a new theory to explain the origin of ceremonial purifications.' Previous to his time it had been thought that such rites were simple analogies of ordinary washing for cleanliness' sake; as men disliked the stains of toil or war, so they felt uncomfortable under a religious pollution; when a worshiper bathed before sacrifice, his act might be formal and the uncleanness invisible, but his motive was the same as when he washed the dust of travel from his hands before sitting down to meat with his host. In so far as he bore any actual defilement, it was moral unrighteousness or sin. But when Tylor found the same rites practised by savages who do not make cleanliness an ideal, and who often seem to use them in their own defense rather than in the cult of gods, the old explanation was no longer sufficienlt. Concluding that the essential and original purpose of the ceremonies was protective, Tylor held, in accordance with his broader theory of animism, that they were intended to drive away harmful spirits or daemons. The theory was adopted by Rohde and other Hellenists, who added the apparent corollary that purity is the absence and impurity the presence of such daemons.2 In its essential form this opinion still prevails. 1 Cf. Edward B. Tylor, Primitive Culture7 (New York, 1924), iI 149f, 429- 442. 2 Rohde, Psyche,6 I 271-274, iI 69-89; cf. Eugen Fehrle, Die Kultische Keu-</page><page sequence="2">Vol. lxvii] Purity in Religion 287 Acceptance of the pre-animistic theory of religion I has led to the view that the daemons whose presence constitutes impurity may be impersonal as well as personal powers or forces. With this one exception, the latest discussion of religious catharsis in Greece takes the same position as Tylor and Rohde, holding that the impure is the evil or harmful.4 Thus the phenomena of Greek religion have been fitted into a framework built up from the evidence of primitive religions. The procedure is not without justification, for the Greek practices show many similarities to those of peoples at a lower stage of civilization. They act on the body of man and on other physical objects by material means.5 Their use implies neither a doctrine of moral guilt 6 nor a belief in anthropo- morphic gods.7 In some instances, they clearly serve to drive away daemons.8 On the other hand, it is uncritical to deduce the position of such facts in the system of Greek beliefs from external analogies alone. Their significance must in the end be determined mainly, if not entirely, from the Hellenic evidence. An investigation of purity and purification in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. along these lines leads to conclusions radically different from those that are now prevalent. The physical purifications of this period can be divided into two classes distinguished by their immediate aims. One class may be designated as remedial cleansings, since their purpose is to remove from man or his environment something that may be directly or indirectly harmful to him in ordinary schheit im Altertum (Giessen, Topelmann, 1910), 35f; Theodor Wachter, Reinheitsvorschriften im griechischen Kult (Giessen, Topelmann, 1910), 2-4; Paul Stengel, Die griechischen Kultusaltertuimer 3 (Munich, Beck, 1920), 156, 159. 3 For a general discussion of preanimistic ideas in Greek religion, and a bib- liography of the subject, cf.

The other class, which may be called preparatory cleansings, has as its aim preparation for participation in cult activities. I shall deal with the latter first, making the single assumption, to which there can be no objection, that the state attained by purification for cult is purity. The occasion for employing preparatory catharsis is de- termined by cult statutes and by unwritten law. Every orne who enters a sacred place or takes part in a religious ceremony must at least wash his hands or sprinkle himself with water.' The laws in these matters apply not only to men but to animals and inanimate objects as far as their nature permits. On priests and other officials of cult they are binding with particular strictness.10 Precincts, altars, instruments of wor- ship, even images of the gods, may be defiled and hence may need to be cleansed.1" The sources from which impurity arises vary somewhat for different cults.12 All, however, regard as impure certain manslayers anid the dead and those who come in contact with them. Childbirth, sexual intercourse, the eating of certain foods, and the touching of certain metals may also make one impure. As impurities differ in strength, they require more or less e)aborate forms of catharsis. For some, the simple sprinkling at the entrance to a shrine appears to be sufficient. For others, including those of birth and death, a special purification is usually necessary; in such cases, exclusion from cult for a definite period may also be prescribed.13 The 9 Stengel, Gr.

Purity, however it may be constituted in any one case, is indispensable to one who would approach the gods or holy things. Such a requirement implies the belief that the pure is fit and the impure unfit to approach the holy, or, in the terms of anthropomorphic theism, that the one is pleasing and the other displeasing to the gods. Secondly, it would usually lead people to believe that there is a similarity between the holy and the pure, an opposition between the holy and the impure. The vocabulary of purity and purification for cult shows four peculiarities. First, it employs not only the words that designate cleansing processes, but also words that denote the state produced by the cleansing. Thus we find in addition to KaiaapELv, Ka6apaLs, and Ka6ap.tos, the adjectives Kacapos and aKaOapTos the noun Ka6apTh7s, and the verb KacapEVELP. Second, words signifying defilement, particularly /ttapos and its cognates, are common in this sphere. Third, as quasi- synonyms of Ka6apos etc., we find corresponding formations from the stem of ayvos. The equivalents may appear in conjunction; e.g., the full expression for 'purity' is aylyvca KatL Ka0apon77s. Finally, the word OoLOs occasionally replaces a&amp;yo's and Ka6apos.15 Now although AyvdEa and KaOaporTns describe what is ob- jectively the same state, they present it under two different aspects. 'A-yvELa, it appears, originally signified 'holiness,' the property of awakening religious awe.'6 'A-yvos, then, is 14 E.g., Aesch. Eum. 283; Eur. I.T. 1223.

Stukey [1936 properly an epithet of gods and of those men and things that inspire a like veneration, such as cult places, objects, and persons. In the field of purity, however, ayvos is applied to ordinary men who are not endowed with any particular sanctity that their fellows need respect. This development has been explained in two ways. Williger 17 holds that ayvos as an epithet of cult objects and of the elements fire and water signifies not only their holiness but also their purity. Since the purity of men is like that of these things, the epithet would naturally be transferred to them with the restricted sense. Arbesmann and Pfister,18 on the other hand, argue that since a-yios in its original use implies that its subject is filled with supernatural power, it must bear the same implication in its secondary use. In their view, the pure man possesses super- natural power which he has maintained and strengthened by observance of the laws of purity, that is by keeping or driving away all evil weakening powers. Without doubt, the meaning of atyvos could have developed along one or the other of these lines. Both the theories, however, assume that in order to be called a&amp;yvEaa, the purity of man must be objectively identical with the property of the divine that bears the same name. It is equally possible, of course, that the similarity between the two was partial and Subjective, that purity roused some of the same feelings in men as the holiness of the divine, though not the essential awe of supernatural power. Until proof is offered to the contrary,"9 therefore, we may conclude that the significance of &amp;yvELca in connection with purification lies in the connotation of its original meaning. Hence ayvos in this use has very much the same force as our 'holy' or 'godly' when they describe laymen. Whereas a&amp;vos is in origin a purely religious term, KaOapo'S and 17 Hagios 52-60. 18 p. R.

Purity is regularly associated with whiteness and brightness and the absence of corporeal filth.2' Ka6aps Ta p XE0Pcs fb6vov 22 iS a direct metaphor from the visible world. The Greeks, then, looked upon catharsis for cult as a hallowing or sanctification. At the same time, they regarded it as a cleansing to wash away a stain. Thus the phrases A-yvela KaL Kacaporp77s and a"yv-S KaLi KacapWcps are far from redundant. They give equal prominence in expression to the two components of the Greek concept of purity. Unlike 'ayvos and Kacapos, Oo-tos is an infrequent term in catharsis. However, in some instances,23 it obviously usurps the place of the other two words. Similarly, the verbs 6o-toiv and 'aooYotvv may be used in connection with KaOaLpELv.24 The most general significance of 6o-tos in common use is 'permitted or not forbidden by the gods or divine law.' In this are comprehended two special senses. On the one side, 'O-LOs means Iprofane, not set apart on religious grounds,' as in the well-known phrase bEpa Kal o0-ta. In another direction, its meaning ranges from 'permitted' to 'required by the gods or divine law.' From a slightly different point of view, 6OawOS is 'religiously right and fitting.' From still another, it is, in Euthyphro's words, 'pleasing to the gods.' 25 In purification the meanings of 6O'tOs are obviously those of the second class; and the word signifies the absence of religious ban, the absence of anything unfitting or improper, and the approval of the gods. 20 The technical religious meanings are not found in Homer. 21 Cf. the many prescriptions for the wearing of clean or white clothing col- lected by Wachter, Reinheitsvorschriften 15-20, 22 40vos here is 'blood'; cf. the equivalent formula in Eur.

Stukey [1936 As we shall see, purity is only one of the requirements for participation in cult, and only one of the conditions of 6oSt6rrn. Hence oc-Los is the general term to which 'ayvos and KaOapos correspond as particulars. As a whole, then, the vocabulary confirms the inferences that were drawn from the purpose and occasion of these rites, namely, that the pure would be regarded as fit to approach the holy, as pleasing to the gods, and as like the gods and holy things in some way. Secondly, it makes clear that of the several properties of the gods, it is their holiness and awesome- ness that purity resembles. Thirdly, it shows that this resemblance to holiness and a likeness to cleanness are the peculiar and distinctive features of purity to the Greek mind.26 So far we have considered purity only as it affects man's position in cult. Some impurities, however, are also thought to injure him outside of cult. This is particularly true of the pollution of blood, which affects both the slayer and those who come in contact with him. Thus when Phaedra's nurse is seeking the cause of her mistress' distress, her first question is, "Are your hands clean of blood?" 27 Again, although there is no cult ban on those who associate with a manslayer, men avoid him as far as possible. It is bad for them to be infected with his pollution, as Antiphon puts it. Hence trials for homicide were held out of doors, so that the court and the prosecutor need not come under the same roof with the slayer.28 Orestes has these beliefs in mind when he offers the fact that his presence has not harmed others as proof of his purity.29 When the supposedly unclean Orestes and Pylades are to be led 26 Cathartic practices do not necessarily involve the idea of cleanness, for the means of purification may themselves be, strictly speaking, unclean; cf. the blood used to cleanse the homicide and the purification with mud mentioned by Dem. 18.259, and the comment on such rites in Heracl. fr.5. However, while the idea of cleanness is thus secondary to that of holiness in one respect (cf. Pfister in Pauly-Wissowa, Suppb. vi 153), it is equally essential with holi- ness in the development of the concept of purity. 27 Eur. Hippol. 316 (see note 22). 28 Antiphon 2.1.10, 5.11. 29 Aesch.

As a rule, the Greeks had no fear of pollution in daily life from any source but homicide. Remedial cleansings have been defined as those that remove something injurious to man, and have thus been distinguished from cult purifications by their primary aim. Among the ills from which they are thought to give relief, we may first of all notice sickness, including madness.32 The disease itself is sometimes washed away.33 At other times, the purification removes the cause of sickness; this may be a god or hero, as in the Sacred Disease.34 Secondly, there are a large number of afflictions resulting from the presence of avenging divinities or from enchantment. Against these, even the author of the Sacred Disease admits that religious catharsis may be effective.35 According to the prevailing view of purity, those who suffer from these evils should be impure. By any test that can be applied, however, they seem rather to be pure. Whether a man is sick, bewitched, or plagued by avenging daemons, he is not banned from cult places on that account; on the contrary, he is frequently taken to them for treatment.36 Further, he is not said to be unclean (Kacapos or ,utapos) because of his in- firmity, nor is health or soundness designated by Kacap0777s. Finally, the vocabulary of remedial catharsis does not employ the words for holiness and unholiness that are so common in preparatory catharsis. These facts show conclusively that there is a whole class of purifications or cleansings that has nothing to do with religious purity, and does not involve the 30 Eur. I.T. 1226-1228. 31 Theophr.

Stukey [1936 idea of purity, though its foremost concern is the relief of man from evils.37 Although it is therefore impossible to identify the impure with the harmful in general, it remains to consider whether impurity is not harmfulness of a particular sort, namely, hindrance to man in his intercourse with the divine. In more familiar terms, this is the question whether impurity is to be defined as that which is displeasing to god.38 Now we must suppose that whatever is banned from cult is displeasing to god and an obstacle to the desirable issue of cult activity. This being so, the suggested definitions do not accord with Greek beliefs. The mere fact that a person is excluded from cult is not enough to justify calling him unclean. Men are barred from certain cults, women from others, and foreigners from many, without any mention of their uncleanness. It is the same with the exclusion of iron and with the taboos against wearing rings or knots. Again, in the matter of animals that may or may not be offered, purity is secondary to species in determining desirability. Impurity cannot be the ground for certain types of restricted bans. For example, women were not allowed to go beyond the foot of the altar at Olympia, though they must have been pure to have come so far.39 Men could enter the temple of Core at Megalopolis once a year; 37 This point was recognized apparently by Friedrich Wolfgang Reiz. Cf. 'EK rCUV 'ApII-ror4EXovs OvIoXLTLKCV (published anonymously, Leipzig, 1776), 104: Sane Graeci Ka'OapUL-v dicunt non modo curationem et sanationem, sed etiam expiationem et lustrationem.

Hicks, The Politics of Aristotle (London and New York, 1894), 8 and 645, note 2.) Wachter, Reinheitsvorschriften 4, also makes a distinction between purification for cult and "private" catharsis for protection against daemonic influences in everyday life. Ills of the latter type, however, are in his opinion defilements, even when, as in the case of sickness, they are not cult impurities. 38 Cf.

A foreigner may defile the holy things he approaches,42 and if iron is taken into a shrine,43 or if an im- proper victim is offered," the temple or the altar must be cleansed. There is something about the stranger, the metal, or the offering that comes off and is left on the things to which they are brought near. Obviously it is the same when it is on the original bearers as when it has been transferred to other persons and objects; yet it is regarded as a defilement only in the latter case. However, except that the situation in these instances is clearer than in others, it is typical. In the great majority of instances, impurity is acquired by bodily change or contact. The evil state is a corruption of a normally good state and is caused by the presence of something alien. The latter can be removed by washing or by the application of absorptive devices. We have here all the necessary conditions of natural physical cleanness except visibility and tangibility. It can hardly be doubted that the ideas of cleanness and uncleanness were brought into the vocabulary of purification in this way. It appears that any definition of purity to be sufficient would require so much qualification that it is idle to offer one. The real value of the concept to those who wish to understand ancient thought lies in the connotations of holiness and cleanness. 40 Paus. 8.31.8. 41 Johannes de Prott et Ludovicus Ziehen, Leges Graecorum Sacrae e Titulis Collectae (Leipzig, 1896-1906), II 1, no. 93B. 42 Cf.
