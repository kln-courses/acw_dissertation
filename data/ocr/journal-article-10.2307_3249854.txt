<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARILYN HIRSH MAHENDRAVARMAN I PALLAVA: ARTIST AND PATRON OF MAMALLAPURAM Agreat deal has been written on the beauty, mystery and unique character of the monolithic carvings at Mimallapuram. It is the sole site representing the fully evolved early Pallava style. The refined perfection of its figural sculpture seems equally removed from the crude dvarapalas, door guardians, in the early Pallava caves of Tamiln.du attributable to Mahendravarman 11, and from the crowded, energetic style of the reliefs at the KailIsanntha Temple at Kiricipuram.2 The stylistic sources of the monolithic monuments have been presumed to develop out of the art of Andhra Pradesh as seen at Amarivati and Nagnrjunakon&lt;d.a.3 However that period comes to an end in the early fourth century, while Mgmallapuram dates to the early seventh century.4 Furthermore great and original works cannot be explained by previous works of art alone. An attempt will be made here to attribute the eccentricity, the high artistic quality, the grandeur of scale and conception of the monuments at the site to the direct, personal intervention of a royal artist/patron, Mahendravarman I, who reigned ca. 571 A. D. to 630 A. D. The monuments at the site represent an inspired sense of intellectual and artistic play. This may explain a 90 x 35 ft. wall of sculpture, or a row of monolithic granite temple models, where religious criteria alone would not account for these forms. This site may be seen as a supreme example of the patron as artist. It is rare in the history of art to find a patron who is also the leading artistic mind behind a creative enterprise. A royal patron has the power to throw almost unlimited resources into the realization of artistic goals (unlike the usual position of the artist who works to fulfill a patron's commission.) Mimallapuram is the field for the play of a king who, in his own words, sees himself as Vidhi, the creator, Vicitracitta, the curious-minded, and Matta- vilasa, drunk with pleasure.5 1 K. R.

The unfinished state of all the monuments, implying the abrupt cessation of all work upon the withdrawal of patronage, may indicate rejection of the eccentric nature of the whole monolithic program by the immediate successors of Mahendravarman I. In undertaking to write about the site of Mimallapuram I am conscious of the long tradition of foreigners who have become involved with the mysteries of this site. Scholars and travellers, from the eminent Chinese Buddhist monk Hstian-tsang, in the seventh century, through Elihu Yale, in 1682, to the pioneering British and French scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, viewed the temples, caves, and reliefs, and came under their spell. Two bibliographies have been written to outline the long list of contributions by Indian and foreign scholars to the field of Mn- mallapuram studies,6 and yet the central questions about the site remain unresolved. Why were a row of temple models, rathas, in a variety of architectural forms carved from a huge whale-back-shaped rock and a nearby boulder? What is the meaning and myth of India's largest relief sculpture, 35 ft. x 90 ft. of lively figures and animals? Who was the patron under which all of this was undertaken? What religious or political message was meant to be conveyed? How long did it take to produce what we now see? Who were the artists who created these monuments which seem to stand quite alone as the only marvel of their period and style? Where did they come from? Where and why did they go, leaving all their creations, so hard won from the intractable granite, in a semi-completed state? In describing the row of temple models called rathas Percy Brown has stated the usual puzzlement of scholars when confronted with the unique character of the mono- lithic monuments. "Each (ratha) is obviously a replica, quarried out of the whale-backed rock previously mentioned, of a separate type of religious structure evidently common at the time, and built largely of wood, as is shown by the beam-heads, rafters and purlins faithfully represented in the granite reproduction. Each example, with all these features is so well preserved as to be perfectly comprehensible, but the question at once arises, what was the object and intention of recording so faithfully and with such infinite toil each architectural type, as if it were a full sized model, or to be regarded as a standard pattern for the guidance of the temple builders? Solitary, unmeaning, and clearly never used, as none of their interiors is finished, sphinx-like for centuries these monoliths have stood sentinel over mere emptiness, the most enigmatical architectural phenomenon in all India, truly a 'riddle of the sands'."7 Unless a plaque is suddenly unearthed stating, "I created these monuments to honor with artists from in the year " the puzzles and mysteries will remain. If the answers were easy they would have been found long ago because 6 N. S. Ramaswami, M;mallapuram: An Annotated Bibliography, Madras, 1980. William Willetts, An Illustrated Annotated Annual Bibliography of Mahabalipuram: On the Coromandel Coast of India 1582 - 1962, International Association of Tamil Research Series, Kuala Lumpur, 1966. 7 Percy Brown, Indian Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu Periods), 3rd ed. rev. and enl., Bombay, 1956, p. 79. 110</page><page sequence="3">many of the best scholars to have worked in the field of South Indian art have given major portions of their professional lives to the quest for answers. It is therefore with a great sense of gratitude for the work which has gone before, without which my work would not have been possible, and with a great sense of my own audacity at proposing solutions to the enigmas presented here, that I attempt to enter the ranks of Mn- mallapuram scholars. I came to this study through the back door, having proposed at first to write on the Pgndyan art of the far South (ca. 700-900 A. D.). I assumed that the art of the Pallavas, so well known and long studied, and upon which the Pn&lt;;dyas were so dependent, would be clearly defined, well documented and non-controversial. It seemed a good place to begin. However it did not take long to discover that nothing was fixed in Mimallapuram studies, all questions were open, and that at least two major theories divided the scholarly community into lively opposing camps. While going through the arguments and studying the monuments, I became more and more captivated by this beautiful, mysterious site. I also found that architectural evolution and epigraphy, the two major avenues of inquiry, both have serious drawbacks due to the isolated and unfinished condition of the monolithic monuments. The theories based on architectural evolution appear to be doomed by one great flaw. The rathas are the first architectural monuments in the round preserved in South India. All scholars agree that they are models of temple types originally made in brick, mortar, metal, wood, thatch and stucco known at that period. They encompass a variety of ground plans, elevations, and pillar types which obviously had a long prior development. Why should one assume that the stylistic evolution and sequence of architectural development which these monuments encompass took place at Mimalla- puram? It would be just as valid to state that the initial impetus to work in stone which expresses itself here, brought forth, simultaneously, the whole spectrum of available forms, both old and new, which were then in use in the South in other materials. Given the well documented conservatism of architectural form involved with religious monu- ments, one could make a good case for the continuation of types associated with specific deities long after newer forms had been introduced. One might speculate for example on the association of the Goddess with the thatched hut type as seen in the Draupadi ratha. This would certainly seem a more fruitful direction than the assump- tion that the Draupadi ratha, based on a simple thatched single-celled shrine, was the earliest monument at the site and so on. In this case, the context of the Draupadi ratha clearly precludes such an assumption. Yet scholars of great eminence base their chrono- logical and royal assignments of date and patronage on a presumed sequence based on stylistic evolution of architectural forms. Because of the great wealth of examples at the site, it is possible to document a likely evolution of South Indian temple types from the monolithic models, in both free-standing and cave-temple formats, and this has been done with great precision by K. R. Srinivasan8 and T. N. Ramachandran9. While this 8 Srinivasan, Cave- Temples. 9 T. N. Ramachandran, Marg, Vol. XXIII, Num. 3 - 4, Bombay, 1970. 111</page><page sequence="4">sequence is very important for understanding the development of South Indian archi- tecture, it does not necessarily imply a specific chronological, sequential development of the models themselves when viewed in the context of this site. At the very least, in the case of the five Pan.dava rathas, the presentation of a variety of temple types seems to be the object of the undertaking, with consideration of the requirements of worship taking a secondary role. The second line of research used most extensively on the problems of Mimalla- puram is epigraphy. Because of the work of many dedicated epigraphers, the Pallava dynastic chronology, which was once a matter of great controversy, is now fairly well understood.'? The rulers who are important for Mgmallapuram studies are the early Pallavas of the Sirnhavisnu line ruling from Kgcipuram during the period ca. 537 - 728 A. D. A very brief summary of their names, dates, and history may be useful. SIMHAVISNU or Avanisimha (ca. 537 - 570 A. D.) is the founder of the dynasty. He is eulogized as a great conqueror by his son Mahendravarman in his play the Mattavilasa Prahasana. MAHENDRAVARMAN I (ca. 571 - 630 A. D.) The author of two extant farces and now lost treatises on South Indian painting and music, his birudas, honorific titles, record that he was an intellectually curious ruler with great interest in the arts. The Pallava-Calukya wars were probably initiated by him. Traditional records imply that he was born a Jain and was converted to Saivism by the saint Appar. NARASIMHAVARMAN I Mimalla (ca. 630- 668 A. D.). The most mili- tarily successful Pallava ruler. He invaded the Cglukyan capital of Vntnpi and defeated his great rival Pulekefin II. He thereafter used the title Vitipikonda, 'the conqueror of Vntapi'. He launched a naval expedition to Sri Lanka to assist his ally the Sinhalese Prince Manavamma in regaining his throne. The Chinese pilgrim Hstian-tsang visited Kncipuram during his reign, ca. 642 A. D., and found it to be a splendid and prosperous city. MAHENDRAVARMAN II (ca. 668 - 672 A. D.). His reign was short and obscure. PARAMESVARAVARMAN I (ca. 672-700 A. D.). He was an ardent Saivite. He continued the C.lukyan battles and also fought the Ganigas. He seems to have been engaged in warfare for most of his career. NARASIMHAVARMAN II Rijasimnha (ca. 700-728 A.D.). His long and relatively peaceful rule was marked by the building of structural temples, the foremost of which are the Shore Temple at M.mallapuram, the T.la- giri~vara Temple at Panamalai and the Kail.sanatha Temple at K.cipuram. All are dedicated to Siva. '0 C. R. Srinivasan, Kanchipuram through the Ages, Delhi, 1979, chronological table p. 25, The various dates ascribed to the Pallava rulers by major scholars are summarized. 112</page><page sequence="5">At various times all the rulers, with the exception of the first, Simhavis.nu, have been credited by one or more major scholars with the patronage of the monolithic monu- ments at Mimallapuram. Usually the monuments are apportioned among them in a chronological sequence based on architectural development with epigraphy used to support the analysis. Mimallapuram itself yields many inscriptions. Other inscriptions engraved on tem- ples in KPfcipuram and Pallava cave-temples, plus royal copper-plate inscriptions provide a fruitful body of data on which to base research. In 1962 R. Nagaswamy forcefully attributed all the monuments to Narasimhavarman II, Rijasimha (ca. 700 - 728 A. D.) on the basis of an epigraphical study." After reviewing literature, paleogra- phy, and the evolution of architecture, he settled on epigraphy as the sole criterion which can be used with confidence on the problems of Mimallapuram. Stylistic ana- lysis, which he has used with great skill in his extensive work on C6!a bronzes, is not considered here, even in order to be dismissed. However, owing to the unique problems at the site of Mgmallapuram, epigraphy can mislead one to false and impossible conclusions. While it is obvious that no inscription can be placed on a monument prior to its creation, it does not necessarily follow that an inscription must be coeval with the monument. As in the case of graffiti, an inscription can be carved on a monument from any time after its creation until the moment under consideration. In order to assume that an inscription is contemporary with the monument upon which it is written certain criteria have to be met: 1. Is the location logical in placement in relation to the monument as a whole? 2. Is the paleography consistent with the period? 3. Does the content relate to the monument or does it seem to contradict the contents of the architectural or sculptural program? Most of the inscriptions at Mgmallapuram are consistent with the variety of scripts known to be from the early Pallava period, ca. 600 - 700 A. D., although tending for the most part towards the end of this range. However, many inscriptions are found on floors and walls in ways that suggest they are later additions. There are, in fact, glaring disjunctions between sculptural and epigraphical content. The most striking example is the famous "Saivite curse" which Srinivasan translates as "Six times cursed be those in whose hearts does not dwell Rudra (Siva), the deliverer from walking on the evil path!'"2 This curse appears four times at the site: on the GaneSa ratha, the Dharmaraja mandapa, the Rnminuja mandapa, and the Adi Varaha mandapa. Nagaswamy does not hesitate to assign all four monuments to the same ruler and the same period despite the occurrence of the Saivite curse in a Vaisnavite cave and the placement of it on the SR. Nagaswamy, "New Light on Mimallapuram", The Archaeological Society of South India, Silver Jubilee Volume, Transactions for 1960 - 62, Madras, 1962, pp. 1 - 50. 12 Srinivasan, Cave-Temples, p. 173. 113</page><page sequence="6">floor.'3 Would it not be much more likely to assume that the four epigraphs of the curse are subsequent additions by an ardent Saivite, than to assume that the same ruler authorized monuments with very different sculptural programs and then placed the incongruous curse upon their floors and walls? These introductory remarks are not intended to be dismissive of the value of either architectural or epigraphical evidence at Mgmallapuram. The site is of major importance and was probably the most extensive building project of its age. It is likely that new architectural forms, like the lion-based pillar, did evolve at the site. But the use of architectural criteria alone cannot be the primary emphasis of a study aimed at solving the chronology, patronage, and stylistic sources of the art of Ms- mallapuram. While epigraphic evidence is not to be slighted, the greatest argument against the contemporaneity of most of the inscriptions is the unfinished state of the monuments. Without exception, all of the monuments at Mimallapuram are unfinished! A few, like the Ganefa ratha and Varaha mandapa, are nearly complete, while others are barely begun, but all are unfinished. An inscription is traditionally placed on a monument at the time of its dedication, when it is finished. Some monuments at Mimallapuram were brought into use several reigns after their original creation. Sometimes there were obvious additions and attempts at completion in the stone. Sometimes, perhaps, details were completed by a stucco coating which is now almost completely lost, though enough fragments of stucco remain to show that many of the monuments were given a stucco finish. Some monuments, like the Dharmaraja ratha, were used for worship even in a very incomplete state.'4 It is at this time that the inscriptions were placed, by the ruler then in power. Thus a logical case involving the inscriptions and birudas, honorific titles, can often be made for ascribing the inscriptions to a certain reign, but this does not mean that the ruler was also the creator of those monuments. K. R. Srinivasan in referring to this point also states that the inscription should have been put in place only by the ruler who had undertaken to place the monument in worship.15 The other major assumption which needs to be examined before proceeding involves the traditional assignment of the patronage of most of the monuments to Narasirmha- varman I whose biruda Mgmalla or Mahamalla, "the wrestler" or "the great wrestler", is credited with giving the site its name, Mimallapuram. Narasirmhavarman I is best remembered for his martial prowess. First he was the conqueror of VntSpi, the Cn- lukyan capital, taking upon himself the biruda Vntapikon&lt;d.a, destroyer of Vntipi. In his inscription, engraved in florid Pallava Grantha characters, found on a rock behind the 13 Nagaswamy, "New Light on Mimallapuram", p. 24. 14 The shrine room on the upper floor was completed with a Somaskanda panel in a style which is later than all the other sculpture on the ratha. The ground floor is barely roughed out in many places. Using a statistical, computerized analysis of specific body proportions to separate stylistically discrete groups of images, scholars at Madras Christian College confirm the visible difference in style.

This inscription"7 records the renewal by himself of a former gift to the temple already built by King Skandatisya. Narasimha refers to his role as conqueror. Subsequent major records18 continue to stress his martial prowess and major victories. While wrestling tends to augment the picture of a strong military ruler, it does not usually go hand-in-hand with an artistic nature. Nowhere do we find stressed the aesthetic and cultural pretensions that are so great a feature of the inscriptions and birudas of his father Mahendravar- man I. Without any record to boast of his great accomplishment or any evidence of his interest in temple building in a unique or innovative manner, (he only repaired the temple at Tirukkalukkunram) we are left with only the name itself, Mimallapuram, on which to base Narasimhavarman's traditional claim. Yet the ancient name of the site, Mallai or Kadalmallai was referred to specifically by the Vaisnavite saint Tirumangai Alvir in the eighth century.'9 Therefore, 100 years after the death of Narasimha the ancient name still was current. Military heroes who send forth great armies and set sail to foreign wars spend huge sums of money on the port of embarkation. They are much more likely to be remembered for their exploits than rulers who excel in the fine arts. "Malla" was often adopted as a suffix by the Pallava rulers. Narasirnhavarman's father Mahendravarman I often used the biruda Satrumalla, 'a warrior who overthrows his enemies', and his grandson Parameivara I often was called Ekamalla 'the sole warrior or wrestler'. This place was already known as Mallai by the early Vaisnava saints of the second or third century A. D. It may be possible that the adoption of the suffix Malla was based on an identification with the greatest port of the Pallavas, Mallai, and that in time the site of Mimallapuram became most closely identified with the Pallava king whose naval exploits caused the most expansion and development of the site. The later Pallava ruler Nandivarman Pallavamalla (ca. 732 - 796 A. D.), in his Tamil inscription found on a slab built into the floor in front of the Adi Variha mandapa at Mimallapuram, does refer to the site as Mamallapura.20 He dates to the same period as Tirumangai Alvar who used the ancient name of Kadalmallai in describ- ing the site, so the two names must both have remained current in the eighth century.21 16 South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. XI Part I, Bombay-Karnatak Inscriptions, Vol. I, Part I, 1940 Inscription No. I, pl. I. Nagaswamy has shown that the early 8th century Pallava ruler Narasimhavarman II Rijasirimha also used the title Mahamalla on the KailasanPtha temple at Kgricipuram. In his Viyalur inscription Rijasimha states that he was well known to his subjects as Mahamalla. Thus even the traditional association of this biruda solely with Narasimhavarman I is not necessarily correct. Nagaswamy, "New Light on Mimallapuram", p. 26.

It cannot be stressed too often that all the monuments are unfinished. If artists had truly worked at these stones for over one hundred years, surely they would have finished something. Nagaswamy noted this when developing his short chronology.22 He also recognized the highly personal and eccentric nature of the monuments in attribut- ing them to Rajasirmha, with his highly suggestive biruda, honorific title, of Atyantaki- ma, the king of unlimited fancies. There are only two Pallava rulers who seem to have had intellectual and artistic talent. One was Rajasirmha, at the beginning of the eighth century. His clearly placed inscriptions show him to be the patron of the Shore Temple at Mgmallapuram, the Tglagiri~vara Temple at Panamalai, and the Kailisanitha Tem- ple at Kifcipuram. Though Nagaswamy has chosen to stress the differences in these temples,23 I find that they do form a coherent group with definable attributes. 1. They are all structural stone temples, not monoliths. 2. They are all related in architectural and sculptural style. 3. They are all dedicated to Siva.24 4. They have clear sectarian iconographic programs. 5. They are all finished. The monolithic monuments at Mgmallapuram also form a coherent group. 1. They are all monolithic. 2. They are related to each other in sculptural style, but not to the Rajasirnha group. 3. They are devoted to a variety of deities. 4. They have unique and idiosyncratic iconographic programs, which do not con- form to any known religious text or usage. 5. They are all unfinished. The other Pallava ruler with a historical reputation for artistic talent is Mahendra- varman I. It is astonishing how much biographical information has been preserved about this ruler. In general Indian rulers have left almost nothing to enable historians to reconstruct a picture of their personal characteristics. Most inscriptions follow well known formulas which compare the king's qualities to the gods. They praise his prowess in war and devotion to the gods in elaborately constructed Sanskrit poetic forms. The inscriptions relating to Mahendravarman show every sign of having been composed by the king himself. Though following known forms they present a much clearer picture of this highly eccentric ruler than is usual. The chief sources of know- ledge are stone inscriptions, inscriptions by feudatories, copper plates of later rulers and the two preserved plays written by Mahendravarman I, the Mattavilasa and the Bhaga- 22 Nagaswamy, "New Light on M.mallapuram", p. 4. 23 Nagaswamy, "New Light on Mamallapuram", pp. 10- 11. 24 I exclude the Visnu shrine in the Shore Temple which contains an earlier image surrounded by two Saivite shrines. This is most likely the attempt of an ardent Saivite to turn a spot which was already famous as being sacred to Visnu to a new Saivite sectarian use. It betrays a sense of sectarian rivalry rather than the all-inclusive bhakti which is typical of the monolithic monuments. 116</page><page sequence="9">vadajjuka. The royal custom of using a series of descriptive honorific titles, birudas, was particularly prevalent among the Pallavas.25 The birudas of Mahendravarman I are in Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telegu, the language of Andhra Pradesh. They appear on his cave-temples deep in Tamil country, including the most elaborate and most southern cave-temple with an inscription of Mahendravarman's at Tirucirippalli. The Telegu birudas show that his involvement with Andhra Pradesh continued to be strong at the time he was creating his cave-temples in Tamilnidu.26 Mahendravarman I has many admirers among South Indian scholars. Jouveau-Du- breuil says that "King Mahendravarman I is one of the greatest figures in the history of Tamilian civilization".27 T. N. Ramachandran in the 1930s28 and Michael Lock- wood in recent years29 have presented elaborate and convincing evidence of the tal- ents of this ruler in the fields of architecture, painting, music, poetry and drama. A short overview of his artistic achievements will be presented here. It is proposed that the presence of one of the most artistic and eccentric rulers in Indian history at the period of the development of one of India's most original and aesthetically superb group of monuments is no coincidence. A case will by made for Mahendravarman I being the patron and direct creative force responsible for the monolithic monuments at Mimallapuram. The short inscription on the cave-temple at Mandagappattu uses the biruda Vicitra- citta (the curious or myriad-minded), perhaps the most evocative of all the birudas of this intellectually curious monarch. It proudly announces the creation of a new pheno- menon in South Indian temple art. This is the temple caused to be built by king Vicitracitta (the curious minded) for the Trimur- ti, i. e., BrahmP, I~vara (Siva), and Visnu - a structure designed without [the use of] bricks, timber, metals, and mortar.3? It is clear that this excavation was something new and unique. It was "caused to be created" by the king who is the one that is curious and inventive, and it is he who 25 Narasimhavarman II Rijasimha uses the greatest number of birudas. Of the 244 titles on the Kailisanitha temple in Kificipuram listed by Michael Lockwood, by far the greatest number refer to martial valor and royal omnipotence, even though his reign was the most tranquil of all the Pallavas. Only seven deal with the arts, about the same number as deal with his skill in handling elephants. It is hard to make a convincing case for his overwhelmingly artistic nature from the evidence of his birudas. Michael Lockwood, Mamallapuram and the Pallavas, Madras, 1982, Appendix A, pp. 108 - 115. 26 The absence of his birudas on the cave-temples at Undavalli, Mogalarijapuram, and Bhairavakonda in the state of Andhra Pradesh provides negative evidence for his lack of personal involvement in the creation of these monuments. 27 G.

Many other birudas of Mahendravarman's have a double meaning. Punning, called dhvani in Sanskrit, is an intellectual device used constantly in Sanskrit literature. The use of punning and double entendre implies a high level of cultural pretension and attainment. What is particularly characteristic of Mahendravarman's literary efforts is the use of puns which may have derogatory or negative connotations in reference to himself, such as already noted with vicitra. To use one of Lockwood's examples, another biruda, Virasa, literally means "insipid"; on a second level it may imply "One who has attenuated his sensual experience - as for instance a sanyasin (ascetic holy man) would do". At a third level "Virasa sheds its negative aspect altogether and is transformed into the wholly positive meaning of 'He of extraordinary sensitivity' (in matters artistic or spiritual). This transforma- tion is possible because the prefix vi in Sanskrit can have a positive as well as a negative effect."32 The most negative seeming of all Mahendravarman's birudas is Mattavilasa meaning 'drunken revelry' or 'the sport of a madman'. It would be hard to explain in a positive manner if it were not the title of one of Mahendravarman's farces. In this farce a drunken Saivite of the lowest order and his equally drunken consort argue with a decadent Buddhist monk over a lost skull-bowl in the street in front of a bar in the Pallava capital of Kaficipuram. Besides poking lethal fun at the inadequacies of the followers of two Saivite sects, the Pgfupatas and the Kgpalikas, the author lambastes the Buddhists for their highly comfortable interpretation of the Buddha's message, and even manages a few cracks at the Jains. The characters are drunken revelers, yet he takes Mattavilisa as a personal title also.33 Moreover in the state of Kerala his play has been preserved as a dance drama for over 1300 years. There it is conceived as an elaborate allegory with the comic characters interpreted as subtle manifestations of the interaction between God and the human soul. This ancient tradition of a devotional significance for the play cannot be ignored. The object of this devotion is Siva, one of whose forms is Bhola, the madman or the simple-minded, often high on bhanga (cannabis) and capable of the most outrageous anti-social behavior.34 That Mahendra- varman rejoiced in his eccentric ways may be seen in another biruda carved on a pillar 31 Ramachandran, "The Royal Artist", pp. 220 -221. Nagaswamy correctly points out the prior existence of Jain polished beds in natural caves in the South and observes that Mahendravarman I does not specifically say that this is the first cave temple. Nevertheless the clear implication is that he is undertaking something new and unique in Tamilnidu. It will be shown that he was aware of and influenced by similar excavations in Andhra Pradesh. This is probably why he does not declare Mandagappattu to be the first such excavation. Nagaswamy, "New Light on Mimallapuram", pp. 7 - 9. 32 Lockwood, "Mahendra's Paradoxical Birudas" p. 16. 33 Lockwood, Mattavilasa, introduction p. XIV, Lockwood gives four levels of meaning for the opening stanza alone. They involve Mahendravarman's relation to his play, his subjects, and his deity Kapall-Siva. 34 Stella Kramrisch, "Siva Bholanstha," Bulletin, Philadelphia Museum ofArt, Vol. 80, Nos. 343 - 44, Summer/Fall 1984, pp. 4-7. 118</page><page sequence="11">recovered with five others from the compound of the Ekambarnitha temple in K.iici- puram.35 On the pillar the biruda Brintah is followed by the verb akari (akari) meaning "the madman or one out of his senses caused it to be made."36 This title occurs on the same pillar with the Tamil biruda Citrakirapuli, lion among painters, which also shows his interest in painting. The second farce Bhagavadajjuka is accepted by both Ramachandran and Lockwood as being by Mahendravarman I.37 The formal qualities and farcical subject matter, which are very similar to the Mattavilasa, support this attribution. In this play an ascetic holy man and a beautiful courtesan are subjected to an exchange of souls due to an error by Yama, the god of death. Each character speaks out of the mouth of the other, to the astonishment of the holy man's undisciplined disciple and the courtesan's com- panions. Again a great deal of fun is poked at decadent Buddhists and Hindus alike. The possibilities for double, triple, and quadruple meanings are not allowed to go to waste. This drama has also been preserved in Kerala as a subtle devotional allegory. In an important but fragmentary inscription in Cave-Temple I at Mimandur38 the two plays are referred to in the same line although damage to the inscription makes the precise meaning of the line unclear. Line 11 of the same inscription as translated by Ramachandran refers to Mahendravarman as Classifying (the subject) from (an old standard) kalpa (i. e., work on the subject) he caused to be compiled a commentary (vrtti) called Daksina-citra (i. e. South Indian art or painting) following strictly the methods and the rules laid down for such a work.39 This treatise on South Indian painting has not been preserved but mention of it supports the assumption of skill and knowledge in painting which the biruda Citrakira- puli indicates. It also implies that Mahendravarman's birudas were based on concrete achievements and not solely on royal hyperbole.4? Also mentioned in the Mimandur inscription, in the first line, is Gandharva-sastra, the science of the mythical half-bird demi-gods, the gandharvas, i. e. music. Mahendra- varman's two plays, besides showing a mastery of the major Sanskrit poetic meters in their verse portions, were undoubtedly also set to music.41 Lockwood notes the 35 This temple is apparently referred to in the Mattavilaisa as Ekambra. It shows the existence of stone pillars in structural temple architecture during Mahendravarman's reign. The temple was presumably constructed of perishable materials except for the pillars. 36 Ramachandran, "Royal Artist," p. 222. 37 The evidence for and against this attribution is summarized by Lockwood in his introduction to the Bhagavad- ajjuka, pp. IX - XV. 38 South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. IV, no. 136, no. 58 of 1888 and Ramachandran, "Royal Artist," pp. 234-238. 39 Ramachandran, "Royal Artist," pp. 309 - 310. 40 The paintings preserved in the Jain cave temple at Sittanavital were attributed to the Mahendravarman period by Ramachandran, pp. 238 -245. Later scholars attribute most of them to the 9th c. following C. Sivaramamurti. (South Indian Painting, New Delhi, 1968, pp. 70-72). He does accept the cave as being from the time of Mahendravarman. Srinivasan, in Cave-Temples, p. 47, believes that the Mandagappattu inscription is evidence of Mahendravarmans's being a Hindu at the time of his first excavation. He therefore attributes SittanavPaal to the Pn.dyas. 41 Ramachandran, "Royal Artist", pp. 236 - 237. 119</page><page sequence="12">23 songs, i. e. poems set to music, interspersed with the prose dialogue and credits Mahendravarman with the creation of musical comedies, which is quite accurate.42 According to T. N. Ramachandran, Mahendravarman invented a system of notation of musical sounds in vocal music. ... by his invention he was able to find a place in vocal music for all the intonations of sounds that a vnin could produce. As luck would have it, the KudumiyPmalai inscription contains this invention of his and immortalizes his achievement in this field.43 At KudumiyBmalai an approximately 15 ft. x 12 ft. rock face is smoothed off and covered with an inscription in an elegant early Pallava Grantha script. The text seems to be a musical description based on notes in the seven classical ragas.44 One particular form of music is also used as a biruda by Mahendravarman. Sankirna- jnti, a mixed, sankirnta, mode of music, jati, also has the literal meaning of mixed caste, jati. This negative attribute would fill a traditional Hindu with horror but it is the kind of negative pun that would probably appeal to Mahendravarman's sense of humor. It is necessary to establish Mahendravarman's unusual interest in stone, a medium which was not used for Hindu religious art in Tamilnadu prior to his reign, but was fully developed in Andhra Pradesh the neighboring state to the north. A good case can be made for Mahendravarman's familiarity with the stone sculpture and the excavation of cave-temples in Andhra Pradesh. He can be clearly placed by inscription in the area of Andhra Pradesh that is richest in cave-temples and stone sculpture of the preceding Visnukundi period. The Andhra Pradesh origins of the Pallavas and their connections to the Pallavas of K~icipuram cannot be gone into in detail here, yet no scholar doubts that there is a strong relationship.45 The Pallavas of Kgiicipuram would clearly look to the great Andhra art tradition as the natural and native style to be emulated, from which their own evolution would take its inspiration. Whatever lithic monuments remain from the pre-Pallava period are in Andhra Pradesh. They provide an ample store of forms and motifs upon which the Pallavas, Mahendravarman in particular, built. The enlarged scale, the granite medium, and the unusual subject matter are Mahendravarman's inventions. The Visnukundi dynasty ruled Andhra Pradesh for much of the period under consideration. Many other minor dynasties, including the early Pallavas, seem to have held intermittent power as the vicissitudes of politics permitted. The Pallavas had a provincial capital at Dhinyakataka for much of the period.46 The Buddhist stupa at 42 Lockwood, Mattavilasa, p. IX. 43 Ramachandran, "Royal Artist", p. 237, and pp. 303- 308. 44 C. Minakshi, Administration and Social Life Under the Pallavas, Madras, 1938, rep. 1977, pp. 267 - 272, provides an evaluation of the epigraphical and musical importance of this inscription and attributes it to Mahendravar- man I. Michael Lockwood, in a conversation in August, 1984, agreed with Ramachandran in attributing the inscription to Mahendravarman. The nearby cave-temple he finds to be Pn.dyan. I agree with his evaluation. 45 For a thorough review of all the relevant inscriptions and their implications see D. C. Sircar, The Successors of the Satavahanas: In Lower Deccan, Calcutta, 1939, pp. 140 - 212. 46 Sircar, Successors, p. 14. 120</page><page sequence="13">Amarivati was still in active worship during this time.47 The limestone reliefs which surround the main stupa are the finest productions of the Andhra style under the S~tava- hanas. The Pallavas could not help but be very familiar with the art and be influenced by its beauty. One other minor Aindhra dynasty, the Ananda Gotra, is important for MPmalla- puram studies because an inscription by one of its rulers is found on a pillar in the compound of the Chezarla apsidal temple along with many important images which date from the fourth to the seventh centuries.48 The ruler mentions that he is a feudatory of the Pallava ruler Maharaja Avanibhijana Mahendravikrama, surely Ma- hendravarman I of Kgiicipuram, who is described as belonging to the Bhnradvaja Gotra. He also mentions the Pallava provincial capital at Dhinyakataka. This securely places Mahendravarman personally in the heart of the artistic area which provided the stylistic inspiration for the early Pallava style. It is important to understand that while the area was not under direct Pallava rule for most of the period, the Pallavas were quick to step into any power vacuums and maintained continual connections with the Visnukundis and the minor dynasties in their orbit. For the purposes of Mgmallapuram studies it is important that Mahendravarman, mentioned by name at Chezarla, may have been personally involved in the politics and warfare of the Verigi region. Sankar- anarayanan makes a good case for a battle between Mahendravarman I and Puleke- Sin II of the Cglukyan dynasty at Lake Koleru around 616 A. D. to fill the power vacuum left by the sudden disappearance of the Visnukundis.49 Pallava history before this time was intimately intertwined with Andhra Pradesh. It is a logical assumption that Mahendravarman had visited the area. The Chezarla inscription and the possible military involvement make his familiarity with this area very likely. The first-hand experience of the Vijayaw.da-Chezarla area, which even today is the richest source for art and architectural remains of the fourth to seventh centuries in Andhra Pradesh, must have opened a flood of visual possibilities to his intellectually and artistically curious mind.s? Mahendravarman, by his own inscriptions, is clearly the patron of the pre-Mi- mallapuram monolithic excavations in Tamilnidu. The introduction of stone as a medium for Hindu temples is yet another instance of his fearless break with previous tradition. In Tamilnidu stone had been used for megalithic burials and the setting up of hero-stones or satA stones. All prior usage of stone, therefore, was associated with death and memorial or funerary customs. The Jains had polished the stone in existing caves and carved stone beds in them for use by ascetics who often fasted to death, therefore continuing this association. Mahendravarman's cave-temples are situated in locations 47 Debala Mitra, Buddhist Monuments, Calcutta, 1971, p. 199. 48 S. Sankaranarayanan, The Vishnukundis and Their Times, Mysore, 1977.

Literary sources and historical research give confusing signals as to the state of the arts in Tamilnidu in pre-Pallava times under the Kalabhra rule.52 Without being able to decide on the level of encouragement given to the arts in prior centuries one can at least be confident that the Ka!abhras were non-Hindus. They were almost certainly Jains of a particularly austere and ascetic type. Yet the first three Vaisnava alvars, devotional hymnists, i. e. Poygai, Padamand, and Pey are dated to the fifth-sixth centuries53 or even earlier. The Saivite nayanmar, Tirumular appears to have lived in the sixth cen- tury.54 They all sing of the gods who reside in specific sites and celebrate their clear, iconic properties. Padamand was from Kadalmallai, which became Mimallapuram. In one verse he upbraids the god at Kadalmallai because he will not lie down on the cool AdiSesha for his couch, but lays Himself down on bare earth55 thus referring to the Talaiayana Visnu for which the site is famous.56 From literary evidence it may be deduced that by that time the major iconic proper- ties of the Hindu gods were known and that places sacred to them already had icons. If there were icons there were artists to create those icons. Continuous Hindu royal patronage probably was not available and without extensive royal patronage it is unlikely that a high style would have evolved. This appears to be the case when one considers the lack of sophistication in many major commissions of dvarapalas in the cave-temples outside of Mimallapuram. It is likely that at first the artists and craftsmen who had the most experience and respect due to their status based on local criteria, most likely the creating of images at particularly sacred sites, would have been given the commissions. 51 Details of prior stone and irrigation works at the sites of Pallava cave-temples are given by Srinivasan, Cave-Tem- ples, p. 31. A very thorough introduction to the megalithic cult including the early use of hero-stones and sati stones is presented by Ramachandran in order to explain the reluctance of Hindus to erect or excavate carved stone temples. Ramachandran, Marg, June, 1970, pp. 25- 27. 52 Elizabeth Rosen notes a recent, small excavation of a typical Iksviku Buddhist settlement in Tamilnidu at Kaveripattinam. This site was one of the major cities mentioned in the Silappadikaram (The Silver Ankle Bracelet) a pre-Pallava text which provides a rich source of information on the religious and cultural life of the period. "Ancient Puhbr is modern Kaveripattinam. The excavation of Buddhist material at that site shows that there was an affiliation between the ancient port city and Amarivati and Nag.rjunakonda.

Photograph by author; permission granted by Archaological Survey of India, 1984</page><page sequence="16">The creation of cave-temples in stone initiated by Mahendravarman I was revolu- tionary enough without the imposition of artists chosen by the aesthetic sensibility of the ruler. The Pallavas themselves were still relatively new to Tamilnidu. To some extent they must have remained associated with Andhra Pradesh, a closely related but linguistically distinct cultural region. There may have been resentment if artists from Andhra Pradesh were favored. Attention to prior traditions has already been shown in the site selection for the cave-temples. It is proposed that at first Mahendravarman I took local tradition and status as the prime criterion in awarding major sculpture commissions in an attempt to gain acceptance for the new use of stone in Hindu temples. This would account for the awkward and provincial quality of many early sculptures. The cave-temple called Mahendravidi is the only site named after Mahendravar- man's personal name; others are named after birudas. By its simple format it is most likely an early example. The foundation inscription gives ample evidence of the reli- gious and artistic climate which is likely to have prevailed at the time of its creation. The single-shrined Visnu cave-temple has a pair of dvirapalas on its shrine facade. The inscription is very informative. "Splitting the rock Gunabhara caused to be made on [the bank of] Mahendratataka, [Ma- hendra's tank] in the great [city of] Mahendrapura this solid, spacious temple of Muriri named Mahendravishnugriha, [Mahendra's Visnu Temple] which is highly praised by good people [and which is] an abode of beauty pleasing to the eyes of men."57 The temple, tank and city are all named after Mahendravarman. Clearly he was very involved in this site. Since it did not have a sacred tank, he constructed one. He makes it clear that he split the rock and thereby made a solid temple. Without reading too much into the inscription one can surmise that if it is "highly praised by good people" than those who do not praise it are not good people. Furthermore most temples are declared to be pleasing to the gods. Here the stress is on it being "an abode of beauty pleasing to the eyes of men." It seems that he is insisting that rock-carved temples are good, solid, beautiful temples which good, beauty-loving people should be pleased to have among them, even if they are new and depart from tradition. The dvarapalas are in shallow relief seeming to be only a base for the finished work of art in stucco and paint. They are strong, well-proportioned figures with confident modelling. It is likely that Mahendravarman would have chosen one of his most skilled artists for a project with which his name was so directly involved. This type of figure has a direct connection to the developed figural style of Mgmallapuram. The Upper Cave at Tirucirippalli is the first example of a rock-cut cave-temple with a unified and highly evolved program of figural and architectural sculpture. It appears to represent the best efforts of the best artists of the period, including Mahendravarman himself as the author of the elaborate poetic Sanskrit inscription. The Upper Cave, near the top of the massive rock hill in the center of Tirucirippalli, overlooking the Kiveri river, is the most southern cave-temple with a Mahendravarman inscription. It repre- 57 Original inscription, Epigraphica Indica, IV, pp. 152 - 153. Translation by Srinivasan, Cave-Temples, p. 66. 125</page><page sequence="17">sents the royal Pallava incursion into ancient Cola and PIngdya territory. The inscrip- tion makes it clear that Siva is pleased to be overlooking the Kiveri, due to Mahendra- varman. Michael Lockwood interprets the great relief of Siva Gailgidhara58 (fig. 1) inside the cave as both a representation of Siva and of Mahendravarman.59 If this interpretation is correct then the god-approved ruler Mahendravarman would be pres- ent in bodily form looking down like a god on the newly conquered territory, keeping it under his control. This is the greatest preserved masterpiece of early Pallava sculpture outside of Mimallapuram. It is only at Tirucirippalli that a single artist with a strong Deccani stylistic heritage has been given a major commission. The Tirucirippalli inscription is the longest, best preserved, and most important cave-temple inscription by Mahendravarman. It is found on pilasters at either side of the large relief panel. A great deal of controversy has taken place about the meaning of the refined, Sanskrit verses. This ambiguity is certainly built into the verses themselves and the composition must have been enigmatic from the moment of its creation. The second verse of the second half of the inscription has been subjected to the most rigorous analysis of all. A brief summary of the possible interpretations of this verse may serve as a paradigm for the multi-layered levels of meaning and allusion which typify the works of Mahendravar- man. In transliteration from the Sanskrit the verse is as follows: GUNABHARA-NAMANI-RATJANY-ANENA LINGENA LINGINI JI9ANAM PRA- THATAlN-CIRAYA LOKE VIPAKSA-VRTTEH PARAVRTTAM The dhvani or double meaning of this verse was recognized in 1890 A. D. by its first English translator, Hultzsch, who saw in it not only a poetic description of the contents of the temple and its meaning but "The whole verse has a double entendre. It contains allusions to Indian logic (Tarkajistra), in which lihgin means the subject of a proposi- tion, lihga the predicate of a proposition, and vipaksha an instance on the opposite side."6? As the inscription is clearly attributable to Mahendravarman it provides evi- dence of his interest in yet another branch of intellectual endeavor, the elaborate system of Indian logic. But aside from its reference to logic, the seemingly more overt level of meaning has been the source of vastly divergent translations. The original translation by Hultzsch is While the king called Gunabhara is a worshipper of the liizga let the knowledge which has turned back from hostile (vipaksha) conduct, be spread for a long time in the world by this li hga.6 1 From this Hultzsch deduced that the inscription alluded to the fact that Mahendravar- man was a recent convert from Jainism to Saivism and had placed a lisga in his hill temple and also a portrait of himself.62 58 Siva catching the force of the celestial river Ganges in his matted locks to break the impact of her fall to earth. 59 Lockwood, "The Philosophy of Mahendra's Tiruchi Inscription", pp. 62 - 73. 6o E.

R. Srinivasan finds liizga to stand for the whole work of excavating the cave-tem- ple and notes the lack of any stone lisga from this early period. He thinks that anthropomorphic images of Siva and Pgrvati were installed in the shrine opposite the Gafigdhara relief. He does not find sufficient support in this verse for the conversion of Mahendravarman.63 The two most recent translations each present a new point of view. P. R. Srinivasan's 1983 translation is By this sign or symbol (which is the cave-temple excavated by the king on top of the mountain) of which the owner is King Gunabhara the knowledge that this is a creation different from the creations of others might spread for a long time in the world.64 He stresses the pride Mahendravarman felt in creating something new and different. Lockwood and Bhat, equating the image of Siva as Ganigidhara with a portrait of King Mahendravarman as devaraja, god-king, a visual dhvani, find confirmation in the poetic dhvani of their translation As the king called Gunabhara has (assumed in this manner) the form (of Siva), let this form (the figure of Gaiigidhara, together with its great fame) turn back the faith (of people) from the surrounding enemy camp (and) forever manifest it (in its true form of Saivism) through- out the world.65 Of course it would have been clear to the Pallava worshipper which forms of deity were installed in the shrine opposite the Ganigadhara panel. They would also have been familiar with Mahendravarman's conversion by Appar, or lack of it. However all of the above translations are valid in Sanskrit along with several more. It is not to be doubted that Mahendravarman was making use of the full range of possibilities for multiple meanings available to a facile and brilliant Sanskrit stylist. This one verse is only the most controversial in an elaborate inscription open to many levels of meaning. It will stand for the complicated and sophisticated use of allusions and multiple meanings that typify all Mahendravarman's preserved writings. The intriguing suggestion by Lockwood that the image of Siva Ganigadhara is also to be read as a portrait of Mahendravarman seems persuasive. The image of Krsna in the Karna Govardhanadhara panel and the Arjuna in the Kiritirjuniyam panel at Mg- mallapuram are both paradigms for the power and virtue of the divine and divinely approved ruler.66 It is possible that they may also be perceived as portraits of the king. This brief survey only gives an outline of Mahendravarman's artistic abilities as preserved, for the most part, in his own words. One more biruda, Catthakiri, has been taken to mean Caityakiri or temple builder. It is his production in this area that I seek to augment by attributing the monolithic monuments of Mgmallapuram to him. The same irreverent, eclectic, innovative spirit that informs his efforts in literature, music, 63 Srinivasan, Cave-Temples, pp. 88 - 89. 64 P. R. Srinivasan, "Gangidharashtakam in Pallava inscriptions from Tiruchirapalli," Srinidhih, Madras, 1983, p. 431. 65 Lockwood and Bhat, "Mahendra's Tiruchi Inscription", p. 68. 66 Marilyn Hirsh, "Royal Implications of the Unique Subject Matter, Scale and Format in the Narrative Reliefs at Mamallapuram," South Asian Religious Art Studies Bulletin, Vol. 3, 1983, pp. 56 -63. 127</page><page sequence="19">and in his early cave-temples is even more boldly in evidence at Mimallapuram. One immediately asks why, if he was so given to literary effort, there is no inscription of his to be found at the site. The unfinished state of the monuments must provide the most logical explanation for this omission, as stated previously. An inscription is placed at the time of dedication, after a monument is complete. The unfinished state of all the monuments is also the soundest argument for a short chronology. K. R. Srinivasan has argued that the hard granite medium makes a short chronology impossible and has given the monuments mainly to NarasimhavarmanI and ParameivaravarmanI (ca. 630 - 700 A. D.), believing Mahendravarman to have confined himself to monu- ments outside the port of Mimallapuram.67 However the difficulty of carving granite only means that more workmen would have been needed to achieve the design. It is mainly wealth and the commitment of unlimited resources by an ambitious and dy- namic patron with a grand personal vision that have provided the stimulus for major building projects from Ancient Egypt, to Greece and Rome, to the Renaissance of the Medicis or Pope Julius II. Mamallapuram may be seen as an example of a grand artistic project which embodies a personal vision of the ruler. It was probably regarded by those around him as eccentric at best and insane at worst. Mahendravarman's use of seemingly derogatory birudas may refer to his awareness of the opinions of his contem- poraries. It involved the breaking of tradition in the choice of medium, stone, and the commitment of large amounts of money and manpower. It is not surprising that his heirs, especially Narasimhavarman I, the Wrestler, with battles to wage on land and sea, were loath to continue the enterprise of carving vast panoramas and monolithic temples from the intractable granite. In the long course of Indian history few rulers have a strong identifiable personal history preserved. Involvement in the arts and a strong aesthetic sense are even more sparsely documented. However one ruler, 1000 years closer to our time, has a well- documented career which may shed light on the development of the Pallava style under Mahendravarman. Akbar, the Mughal Emperor (reigned ca. 1565 - 1610 A.D.) took a great deal of interest in developing a cadre of superior artists in the early years of his long reign. He shares many qualities of intellect and temperament with Mahendravarman I. Parallels between the development of their ateliers as deduced from preserved artistic projects are quite informative. Early manuscripts under Akbar, like the Tati-Nama and the Hamza-Nama, show that artists from all the currently known traditions were employed. The contributions and the stylistic backgrounds of the artists may be sorted out because examples of each style are also preserved.68 Before 67 Srinivasan, Cave- Temples, pp. 37 - 46. Mahendravarman's reign of at least 59 years is verified by inscriptions on hero-stones dated in the years 1, 54, 58 and 59 of his reign. This is the longest reign of any Pallava ruler, by far, and may help to convince sceptics that he had ample time to produce all the creative efforts which I attribute to him. I am indebted to Michael Rabe for pointing out the hero-stone evidence presented by Krishnan. K. G. Krishnan, "Hero-Stone Inscriptions of the Pallava Times," Seminar on Hero-Stones, ed. R. Nagaswamy, Madras, 1974, pp. 1-4. 68 Pramod Chandra, The Thti-nsma of the Cleveland Museum of Art and Origins of Mughal Painting, Graz, 1976, and Stella Kramrisch, Painted Delight: Indian Painting from Philadelphia Collections, Philadelphia, 1986, Intro- duction, pp. XIII- XVI. 128</page><page sequence="20">long, however, these artists had developed a unified and highly sophisticated court style. This took place under Akbar's personal, aesthetic supervision and the tutelage of his appointed studio directors. Those conservative artists who could not adapt to the new stylistic criteria were no longer commissioned. A clearly recognizable Akbari Mughal court style emerged. The sculpture from the Pallava cave-temples outside of Mimallapuram may be regarded as early Pallava equivalents of the Thti-Nama and Hamza-Nama. All available varieties of local talent were utilized in an undigested form. Anonymous Andhra Pradesh masters would be the equivalents of Akbar's Persian masters Abd-as Samad and Mir Sayyid 'Ali. Mahendravarman I, as patron, brought together these anonymous masters to supervise the efforts of the cream of the pre-existing local artists of several traditions. Thus the high court Pallava style of Mimallapuram was brought into existence. At this time the patron took a conscious decision to pursue a unified style of high aesthetic quality. Some artists would not have been able to adjust to the new standard and would therefore not be hired to work at Mgmallapuram. The focus of the article has been to develop a profile of the artistic temperament of the intellectually curious Pallava monarch Mahendravarman I. Pallava cave-temples in Tamilnidu have inscriptions proclaiming them to be the works of Mahendravarman I. The Chezarla inscription and other evidence like the use of Telegu birudas show the involvement of Mahendravarman I with Andhra Pradesh.69 The reign of this ruler, whose signed works proclaim his love for all the arts and his highly unconservative, even mad, desire to follow his own creative urges, and the sudden extraordinary flowering of eccentric, unique works of art at Mgmallapuram are not likely to be coincidental.7? Therefore the following sequence of events is suggested. The exposure to Andhra Pradesh sculptural and architectural forms and the prevalence of monolithic architecture there provided him with a basis for beginning monolithic cave-temple excavations in Tamilnidu. After a period of experimentation and the utilization of local craftsmanship, a major work, the Upper Cave-temple at Tirucirappalli, was undertaken. Following this the decision to begin the massive project of diverse monolithic works at Mimallapuram was taken. A school of artists supervised by masters from Andhra Pradesh worked intensively at the site under the personal direction of Mahendravar- man I. Work ceased suddenly, probably due to the death of the king, and all the monuments were left unfinished. It is difficult to prove that the monolithic works at Mimallapuram are all attributable to the direct personal patronage of Mahendravarman I. However his own literary and epigraphic legacy proves him to have been involved in poetry, drama, grammar, music, painting and architecture.
