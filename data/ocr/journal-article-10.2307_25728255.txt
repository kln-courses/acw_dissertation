<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Hanbali School of Law and Ibn Taymiyya: Conflict or Conciliation. By Abdul Hakim al-Matroudi. Culture and Civilisation in the Middle East Series. London and New York: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 282. ?60.00. The figure of Ibn Taymiyya looms large within the tradition of Hanbali legal thought. Yet, the nature of his affiliation to this school of jurisprudence has long been a point of contention in classical biographical literature with the opinion often expressed that despite impressively attaining absolute status as a jurist, he remained closely aligned with the school of Hanbali law and its traditions of legal thought. Attempting to shed light on the complexities which underpin Ibn Taymiyya's relationship with this school, the work under review not only assesses the substantial nature of his contribution to the school's legal discourse, principles, and methodology, but also scrutinises key points of departure underlining the intricacies of his traditionalist attitude towards the synthesis of the sources of Islamic law and their interpretation. In the process the book provides a valuable digest of the history of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence in both its classical and modern contexts, outlining the major sources of literature utilised within the school together with the theoretical framework within which its orthodox credentials were forged. Despite the fact that Ibn Taymiyya is of course renowned for his strict theological orthodoxy, with this text one gets a real sense of the magnitude of his contributions to the field of Hanbali jurisprudence and the rigour and authority with which this was determinedly accomplished. The first chapter in this text provides historical sketches of the lives of the two figures whose legal legacies and thought lie at the core of this book's focus: Ibn Hanbal (d. 241/855) and Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328). Citing the traditional biographical sources, Matroudi remarks that in his early career Ibn Hanbal studied with some of the leading luminaries of the science of tradition (ahl al-hadlth) such as Hushaym (d. 183/ 799), Sufyan ibn cUyayna (d. 198/814) and cAbd al-Razzaq al-Sancam (d. 211/826). It is noted that he was trained in rational forms of juridical thought associated with the so-called ahl al-ra3y (advocates of speculative reasoning in approaches to the interpretation of law);1 traditional scholarship has identified this rational form of juridical thought with luminaries of the Hanafi tradition such as Abu Yusuf (d. 182/ 798), with whom Ibn Hanbal studied jurisprudence and Hadith (p. 6). Despite the fact that a number of biographical reports mention Ibn Hanbal's having committed to memory some of the principal treatises composed by jurists affiliated to the ahl al-ra3y, Matroudi mentions that he developed a preference for the 'method of Ahl al-Hadith\ adducing the statement of Ibn Taymiyya who spoke of the fact that 'although Ibn Hanbal was from al-Basra, he did not follow the method of this region</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 89 in studying law; rather he adhered to the method of Ahl al-HadltK (p. 6). Referring briefly to the infamous episode of the mihna from which Ibn Hanbal is commonly viewed to have emerged as a champion of Sunni orthodoxy, Matroudi argues that Ibn Hanbal's reputation as a scholar of distinction and a pillar of piety was established well before this event.2 Matroudi next considers some of the arguments concerning the issue of whether Ibn Hanbal was acknowledged among his peers as an esteemed jurist, which was a moot point for some classical writers. Both al-Tabari (d. 310/923) and, much later, al-Qadi Iyad (d. 544/1149) are reported as having viewed him as being principally a scholar of Hadith.3 Indeed, al-Tabari's seminal work, entitled Ikhtilaf al-fuqaha\ which offers a miscellany of juridical views expressed by the leading jurists up to his age, included none of Ibn Hanbal's legal opinions.4 The view that Ibn Hanbal was not taken seriously as a jurist has been touched upon within modern academic scholarship: Wael Hallaq has alluded to the fact that Ibn Hanbal could hardly be said to have approached the rank of individuals such as Abu Hanifa (d. 150/767), Malik ibn Anas (d. 179/795), and al-Shafici (d. 204/820); and that this was accepted by many of his own key students. Hallaq here cites a statement made by the Hanbali jurist Najm al-Din al-Tufi (d. 716/1316), who remarked that Ibn Hanbal was concerned exclusively with 'Hadith and its collection'. Rejecting the inference that classical scholarship had dismissed his importance as a jurist, Matroudi draws attention to the fact that notable contemporaries who were acquainted with Ibn Hanbal's scholarship, such as the famous traditionist al-Nasa?i (d. 303/915), spoke of his combining knowledge of both traditions and jurisprudence.5 He argues that some classical scholars might have entertained doubts about Ibn Hanbal's status as a jurist due to the fact that he did not author a specific work on jurisprudence, and claims that this created the impression that he was not particularly concerned with the subject. Quoting from a statement by Ibn Qayyim (d. 751/1350), who reports that Ibn Hanbal was utterly averse to the authorship of books, Matroudi stresses that negative attitudes towards the authorship of works were in the ascendancy among scholars of Ibn Hanbal's traditionalist persuasion.6 On a somewhat related note, the issues of literacy, orality and the transmission of knowledge within the early Islamic tradition have been the subject of a number of studies by Gregor Schoeler. He has made the point that, in the early years of the Islamic tradition, the exclusively written word was not deemed to be an assurance of authenticity as far as the transmission of knowledge was concerned, noting that learning transmitted through the established lecture system by methods such as samac and qiraJa was believed to be so much more trustworthy. Schoeler reasons that Muslim scholars 'perhaps even as late as the second/eighth and third/ninth centuries, often did not give their work a definite, fixed shape'.7 Interestingly, on the subject of the well-documented aversion to the codification of the Hadith, which was apparently</page><page sequence="3">90 Journal of Qur'anic Studies predominant in places such as Kufa and Basra, Ibn Hanbal did prefer scholars of Hadith to make use of written notes and aides-memoires when transmitting traditions.8 On the other hand, his mentor, Hushaym, is reported to have said that those who do not know the Hadith by heart cannot be enumerated among the scholars of tradition.9 As Matroudi states, despite encouraging the use of written notes for the transmission and preservation of Hadith, Ibn Hanbal believed that 'jurisprudential opinions should not be recorded' (p. 10).10 His belief was that this would foster a profound appreciation of the founding 'sources of legislation'. The suggestion is that such a circumspect grasp of these sources could not be achieved simply through written means; and therefore his not authoring a text on jurisprudence should not be used to question his standing as a jurist. This stance does, however, raise the question of why many among his contemporary peers did choose to compile legal works. Moreover, it is probably the case that the controversy regarding Ibn Hanbal's standing as a jurist has its origins in the debates concerning attitudes towards the synthesis of law; indeed, Matroudi himself has already emphasised the fact that Ibn Hanbal adhered to the method of the ahl al-hadlth in his approach to jurisprudence. Nevertheless, as far as Matroudi is concerned, the historical evidence shows that Ibn Hanbal's status as a jurist is indisputable. On the subject of the texts attributed to Ibn Hanbal, Matroudi lists works such as the famous Musnad, Fada3il al-sahdba and al-cllal wa-macrifat al rijal; he also mentions the Jawabat al-QurJan and al-Radd cala al-Jahmiyya, although doubts remain regarding the ascription of this latter work. In providing a brief survey of the historical foundations of Hanbali jurisprudence, Matroudi draws specific attention to the importance of the genre of masa^il literature. These masa^il works preserved the panoply of legal opinions proffered by Ibn Hanbal on various legal topics. Despite Ibn Hanbal's own opposition to the practice of recording his legal views and opinions, a number of his students went on to compile such texts (p. 11). The genre was critical to the emergence of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence as the materials in these masa?il texts were inductively poured over by later scholarship and used to define the juridical methodology applied by Ibn Hanbal in his approach to the scriptural sources.11 It has recently been stated that although the masa^l literature do not purport to be the very writings of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, they 'seem much truer to life than books from other schools'.12 Scholars who collated the legal opinions and discussions of Ibn Hanbal included al-Athram (d. 260/874), al Kawsaj (d. 251/865) and Ibn Hanbal's sons, cAbd Allah and Salih.13 Matroudi does highlight the importance of the efforts of Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923) who actually performed the task of collating the various masaDil texts compiled by Ibn Hanbal's students. Hallaq's observation regarding the accomplishments of al-Khallal is somewhat relevant to this discussion. He claims that Ibn Hanbal 'had never interested himself in law per se, and when he did occasionally deal with legal issues, he did so in a marginal and tangential manner'.14 Hallaq insists that al-Khallal</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 91 'essentially transformed Ibn Hanbal into the author of a methodologically cogent legal doctrine that sustained all later doctrinal developments'. In his view the emergence of the Hanbali school represents a feature of 'authority construction', in which the doctrines of the reputed founders of a tradition were 'disassociated from those of their predecessors, but also expanded to include the juristic achievements of their followers'. Matroudi provides an entirely different perspective, contending that although the efforts of al-Khallal were critical to the formation of the Hanbali tradition, the definitive tenor of the legal discourse derived from Ibn Hanbal crucially furnished the school with its own unique tradition; and this was reflected in both its corpus of positive law and its synthesis of the principles of jurisprudence. To underline this point he adduces the statement of Ibn Taymiyya who remarked that 'al Khallal was not thoroughly conversant with all of Ahmad's jurisprudential masd?U\ implying that the corpus of legal material bequeathed by the school's eponym was more extensive than hitherto perceived. Matroudi ends this section by reviewing the historical spread of the school. Turning his attention to Ibn Taymiyya and his place within the tradition of legal thought, Matroudi notes that he came from a family of distinguished jurists: his grandfather al-Majd and his father cAbd al-Hallm were both leading Hanbali luminaries. The political and social unrest which followed the Mongol invasions resulted in the family leaving Harran and settling in Damascus (p. 15). Notably, Ibn Taymiyya studied with scholars of all the predominant traditions of jurisprudence, but it was during his youth that he was trained in Hanbali legal thought. In this context, Matroudi does mention that during these unsettled times, 'intolerance and conflict were common among the dominant religious schools of thought' (p. 15). He also refers to the fact that during the early years of his career, Ibn Taymiyya had excellent relations with the ruling Mamluks and his counsel was often sought by al-Nasir (d. 741/1341) (p. 17). However, this state of affairs soon changed as he clashed on theological issues with opponents who were often members of the judiciary and influential state officials. One particular clash with the authorities was triggered by Ibn Taymiyya's authorship of al-Risala al-hamawiyya and a further text al-Risala al-wasitiyya, in which rigorous defences of traditionalist approaches to dogma and doctrine were set out (p. 18). These epistles censured the resort to figurative treatments of dogmatic topics associated with Ibn Taymiyya's theological opponents the Ashcaris. The historical background of the issues at stake are not examined by Matroudi, although he clearly stresses that in his writings Ibn Taymiyya continually invoked an orthodox substrate which underpinned his own arguments. He also refers to there being disagreements on a range of legal and ritual topics which helped fuel the controversies and disputes between Ibn Taymiyya and his opponents. One of these disputes stemmed from Ibn Taymiyya's views on the religious legitimacy of visiting shrines, while the other resulted from his arguments over the efficacy of casual oaths</page><page sequence="5">92 Journal of Qur'anic Studies and the practical status of the intended triple divorce, a matter which brought him into conflict with his Hanbali peers (p. 20).15 Matroudi tends to see the essence of the antipathy between Ibn Taymiyya and his opponents as emanating not only from disagreements concerning jurisprudence and theology but also because his stature as a scholar aroused 'a degree of envy and antagonism on the part of some of his contemporaries' (p. 20).16 This may well be the case, although it seems safe to conclude that tensions resulting from differences concerning theological issues between the Ashcaris and their traditionalist opponents do lie at the core of a number of the controversies in which he was involved. The roots of this hostility have their origin in the earlier tradition and represent an ongoing struggle for expressions of orthodoxy within the confines of Sunnism. It is no surprise that this course of events had such a dramatic impact upon the life of Ibn Taymiyya even though, as Matroudi remarks, many of his distinguished contemporaries were prepared to come to his defence. Included among them is the esteemed Shafici scholar Ibn Daqiq al-cId (d. 702/1302), and no less a figure than al-Dhahabi (d. 748/1348), who, despite disagreeing with him on key issues, described him as being an absolute mujtahid whose 'mistakes should be excused'. With this in mind, Matroudi categorically questions the authenticity of a treatise entitled al-Naslha al-Dhahabiyya ila Ibn Taymiyya, which al-Dhahabi is said to have authored criticising Ibn Taymiyya (p. 22); Donald Little has argued that the ascription is reliable,17 a conclusion he reaches in an article which uses al-Naslha al-Dhahabiyya to evaluate the famous remarks of Ibn Battuta (d. 779/1377) regarding Ibn Taymiyya's state of mind.18 The rest of this chapter lists Ibn Taymiyya's literary legacy, including works in the field of jurisprudence and usul al-fiqh. Matroudi notes that al-Dhahabi spoke of his authoring some '4,000 kurrasa (small booklets) or some 5,000 mujallad (volumes)' (p. 24). Such prolific authorship would seem to confirm the extent of his contribution to classical legal discourse in general, and more specifically the Hanbali school, although underpinning many of these compilations lies Ibn Taymiyya's quest for independent legal reasoning unshackled by loyalties to individual schools of legal thought. Matroudi believes that this is reflected in the ethos which marked Ahmad ibn Hanbal's own juridical methodology. This symmetry in legal perspectives would seem to extend to both individuals' attitude to theological issues. The basic principles of Islamic law according to both Ibn Hanbal and Ibn Taymiyya are the subject of a comparative study in Chapter Two of this book. Given that Ibn Hanbal did not author a work outlining his own principles of law, it was the rich stock of masd?il compilations which were inductively probed by his students in order to flesh out and reconstruct the theoretical bases of his legal methodology. Thus, as early as the third/ninth century scholars such as al-Athram were already attempting to 'infer' the general legal principles applied by Ibn Hanbal (p. 33).19 However, it is the compilations of leading scholars such as Ibn Abi Yacla (d. 526/1132), Ibn</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 93 Tamlm (d. 675/1276) and Ibn Qayyim which are referenced by Matroudi for their definitions of Ibn Hanbal's usul. Although Ibn Hanbal accepted the same sources of law acknowledged by the other mainstream legal schools: namely, the Qur'an, the Sunna, ijmdc and qiyds, Matroudi points out that among Hanbali jurists there existed stark differences regarding the precise identification and classification of these sources of law, particularly as far as the concepts of consensus (ijmdc) and analogical reasoning (qiyds) were concerned (pp. 36-8). The contentious point for modern scholarship is the position taken by Ahmad ibn Hanbal on the authority of analogical reasoning: Hallaq and Melchert maintain that Ibn Hanbal continued to harbour reservations concerning the resort to this legal device despite countenancing certain exceptions, and that he adopted an anti-rationalist approach to the interpretation of law.20 Matroudi offers a more nuanced qualification of Ibn Hanbal's attitude to such methodologies and concepts,21 and goes on, later in this chapter, to demonstrate that Ibn Taymiyya was clearly of the view that the legal ethos of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence and its eponym was anchored to a thoroughly orthodox treatment of the Qur'an and Sunna; moreover (pp. 41-3), it flowed from the usul madhdhab al-Madina (ahl al-hadith). Matroudi argues that Ibn Taymiyya applied the same methodological approaches to the sources of law adhered to by Ibn Hanbal and therefore he was essentially a 'dependent absolute mujtahid\ which, within the hierarchy of distinguished Hanbali scholars, places him among the ranks of luminaries such as Abu Yacla (d. 458/1066), Ibn cAqil (d. 515/1119) and AbuT-Khattab (d. 636/1236). Matroudi is keen to point out that Ibn Taymiyya's adoption of Ibn Hanbal's theoretical approach to the sources of law was not a result of slavish adherence to this individual or indeed the legal school that developed around him. But, rather, it was inspired by the view that in Ibn Taymiyya's judgement, Ibn Hanbal's methodology had meticulously encapsulated the most orthodox approach to the interpretation of the law and one with which the pious ancestors would have been in agreement. As Matroudi notes, Ibn Taymiyya insisted that the Hanballs had 'fewer disagreements among themselves than those of any other schools of law' (p. 41). Interestingly, even at junctures in which Ibn Taymiyya found himself to be at variance with the school on issues of interpretation, such differences were never viewed as being the consequence of disagreements with the school's eponym, but rather with later scholarship's reading of Ibn Hanbal's position on given points of law and sundry methodological procedures; or, that conflicting narrations on the authority of Ibn Hanbal utilised by later scholarship lay at the source of this discord (pp. 48-9). Nonetheless, disagreements with the opinions and rulings of Ibn Hanbal did occur. Matroudi indicates that in such instances it was often the case that these differences resulted from Ibn Hanbal's being unaware of certain narrations on given subjects, while on other occasions Ibn Hanbal could not have known that specifically cited traditions</page><page sequence="7">94 Journal of Qur'anic Studies which he had relied upon were subsequently proved by scholarship to be inauthentic.22 Revision and modification play a significant part in Ibn Taymiyya's contributions to Hanbali legal thought both in the areas of usul and positive law, and these areas are explored in considerable depth in Chapters Three and Four. The rigorous nature of Ibn Taymiyya's scrutiny of the school's legal methodology and discourse is reflected in the criticisms he directed at al-Khallal, whom he claimed omitted many of the masaJil ascribed to Ibn Hanbal (p. 56). One might add here the observation that, on the contrary, Ibn Qayyim appeared to be of the view that as a result of al-Khallal's endeavours only a little of Ibn Hanbal's legal materials were lost.23 Other figures singled out by Ibn Taymiyya include al-Khiraql, who is said to have been the source of incorrect rulings subsequently ascribed to Ibn Hanbal, and Abu Yacla, whose legal opinions were subjected to criticism by Ibn Taymiyya; additionally, the legal rulings and statements proffered by luminaries from the later tradition were authoritatively subjected to scrutiny. Matroudi's key point is that a spirit of revision and clarification determined Ibn Taymiyya's contributions to Hanbali jurisprudence. The fact that Ibn Taymiyya was such an observant and perceptive authority on the legal sources and principles of the school would appear to confirm that the usul ascribed to Ibn Hanbal were more elaborate than hitherto recognised by scholars such as Hallaq: indeed, Ibn Taymiyya does not seem to have questioned the efficacy of the actual processes through which Ibn Hanbal's usul were inferred. Topics highlighted by Matroudi to exemplify Ibn Taymiyya's appraisal of the school's theoretical apparatus include consensus; the use of weak traditions; the phenomenon of metaphor in language; the mujtahid and issues of correctness and error; the division of the Sharfa along the lines of usul and furuc\ comprehension of texts; Islamic law and the Arabs; maslaha; the definition of raJy; the postponement of the clarification of a ruling; issues pertaining to taqlld; and corrections of misunderstandings of other schools of law by Hanbali scholars. Matroudi shows that many of the objections raised by Ibn Taymiyya apropos these key theoretical issues were based on the view that Ibn Hanbal's stance on such subjects was misconstrued by later Hanbali scholars. The claim by some Hanbali jurists that Ibn Hanbal permitted the use of weak traditions as a source of law is an excellent case in point (pp. 59-60). Ibn Taymiyya contended that while Ibn Hanbal's sources of law do refer to the contingent use of weak traditions, the technical compass of the term dacIf did not connote weakness in the technically derived sense that marked the term's usage in later Hadith terminology. The argument is that prior to al Tirmidhl (d. 279/892), who introduced the terms sahlh, hasan and da% scholars divided traditions into sahlh and daclf Thus, Ibn Hanbal was referring to a different category of tradition which would in effect be classed in the later tradition as being hasan. Matroudi does then have to deal with the fact that a recent study has shown that</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews 95 the term hasan was used by Ibn al-Madini (d. 234/848), al-Bukhari (d. 256/870) and even Ibn Hanbal, however, he argues that fine distinctions between the earlier and later import of the term hasan do not impinge upon the validity of the arguments made by Ibn Taymiyya (p. 61). The incidence of metaphor in the language of Arabic is likewise an issue on which Ibn Taymiyya claimed that Ibn Hanbal's views had been misinterpreted. Matroudi maintains that linguistic issues do have a significant impact upon the manner by which scriptural sources are interpreted in both legal and theological contexts. However, one senses that the arguments which Ibn Taymiyya espouses on the subject of denying the existence of metaphors in the language of the Arabs were principally driven by theological as opposed to juridical imperatives. Discourse on the incidence of metaphor, which had later become associated with obviating anthropomorphic imagery predicated of God, appears to go back to Ibn Hanbal's use of the term majaz in the treatise which is ascribed to him entitled Kitdb al-radd cald Jahmiyya wa'l Zanddiqa24 Ibn Taymiyya seized on the fact that at that time when Ibn Hanbal used the term majaz it did not connote metaphor: the early grammarians' use of this term confirmed this much.25 Despite this fact, scholars such as Abu Yacla, Ibn cAqTl and AbuT-Khattab all referred to Ibn Hanbal's employment of this term to sanction their view that metaphors do occur in the Qur'an and the language of the Arabs. As Matroudi shows, Ibn Taymiyya's arguments regarding the import of this term, particularly in the context of the technical terminology of Arabic linguistic thought, are compelling, but one has to ciccept that later Hanbali scholars did not revise their position.26 Nevertheless, these sorts of examples illustrate the assiduousness with which Ibn Taymiyya engaged in the treatment of topics of this nature. Deliberations on the topic of metaphor belong to a protracted debate in which Ibn Taymiyya's contribution to the discussions forms a subsequent part of that discourse, and this is a point that Matroudi underscores.27 On a somewhat related note, when considering whether it was permissible to divide the Sharica into usul and furuc, a division rejected by Ibn Taymiyya but adhered to by most jurists, Matroudi notes that this binary categorisation of the Sharica is effectively acknowledged by Ibn Taymiyya in a number of his later treatises (pp. 69-72). Matroudi maintains that this possibly indicates that Ibn Taymiyya changed his opinion on the subject, although he also acknowledges that there may have been practical reasons for accepting this division: namely that Ibn Taymiyya felt it necessary to entertain discussions on the subject with his peers whose writings were replete with references to this epistemic category.28 While the previous chapter focused on Ibn Taymiyya's contributions to theoretical issues within the sphere of the principles of law, Chapter Four looks at 'clarifications and corrections' made by Ibn Taymiyya to both the corpus of Hanbali fiqh and</page><page sequence="9">96 Journal of Qur'anic Studies methodological conventions and terminologies adopted within the school. Matroudi selects seven areas of law to illustrate the magnitude of Ibn Taymiyya's contributions, thereby underlining his status as a 'dependent absolute mujtahid\ These include innovation (bidca)\ hiyal (legal stratagems); the use of precaution and piety; incorrect legal opinions; jurisprudential terminology; jurisprudential rules; and narrations. Matroudi contends that such contributions demonstrate the resolve with which Ibn Taymiyya was prepared to question his Hanbali peers whenever he felt that their legal opinions could not be reconciled within the spirit of legal orthodoxy defined by what he perceived was the authenticated Prophetic Sunna, a point emphasised throughout this book. Matroudi provides us with some insightful glimpses into his general philosophy: for example, when Ibn Taymiyya acknowledged that juridical inaccuracies and inconsistencies existed in the corpus of Hanbali fiqh, his resourceful approach was to insist that these stemmed from opinions and doctrines which were erroneously assimilated into the school's legal discourse: they were therefore the result of methodological and theoretical oversights by scholars who were under the impression that they were operating within the general legal philosophy of the Hanbali school (pp. 93-4). This permits Ibn Taymiyya to contend that Ibn Hanbal was seldom the source of juridical differences or indeed incorrect rulings (see p. 93, but also p. 109 and p. 126). As Matroudi demonstrates, the tenor of Ibn Taymiyya's argument is forthright: later Hanbali scholarship had to be held to account for misconstruing responsa and inaccuracies in the processes of ascribing legal views to Ibn Hanbal. While reviewing the subject of innovation, Matroudi does emphasise the point that according to Ibn Taymiyya its incidence was more prevalent in matters relating to acts of worship as opposed to dogmatic issues, but that, equally, the Hanbali school was less prone to innovation than the other schools of jurisprudence (p. 94). A strict attitude to the interpretation of the sources symbolised Ibn Taymiyya's relationship with the Hanbali school and indeed the other traditions of jurisprudence. He was only prepared to defend the school if its stance could be reconciled within the spirit of legal orthodoxy championed by the pious ancestors. Accordingly, it was this spirit of orthodoxy which had to be applied not only in assessing the sum and substance of the legal teachings of the Hanbali school of law but that of all the other schools. This outlook is evident in Ibn Taymiyya's criticism of the practice of physically articulating intentions before acts of worship, a practice which a number of prominent Hanbali and ShaficI scholars sanctioned (p. 95f.). Perhaps this sums up the central argument of this book: namely, that the central authority of the construct of authenticated Prophetic Sunna was purposefully enshrined within the paradigmatic legal framework developed by both Ibn Hanbal and Ibn Taymiyya; and, that this construct governed both figures' attitudes towards interpreting law. The tenacity with which Ibn Taymiyya was prepared to champion orthodoxy is best exemplified by Matroudi's discussion of the controversy which followed his issuing</page><page sequence="10">Book Reviews 97 an edict on the subject of travelling for the purpose of visiting graves. Ibn Taymiyya had made the case that if such visits sought to remind the believer of the reality of the hereafter, they were unquestionably recommended, but to visit such locations with the sole intention of venerating the graves of those buried there could not be justified. Ibn Taymiyya adduced Prophetic dicta which expressly prohibited this practice and felt that the act itself was tantamount to polytheism.29 Discussions regarding the permissibility of visiting the Prophet's grave were soon brought into the various arguments (p. 97). Ibn Taymiyya regarded these visits as being equally reprehensible, particularly if their select purpose was to seek benediction (al-tabarruk). The cudgels of his arguments on this issue were enthusiastically taken up by Ibn Qayyim.30 Ibn Taymiyya found himself in conflict with many of his jurist peers, including leading Hanbali scholars, and it was his position on this issue which was later used to secure his detention. Matroudi argues that ideological opponents of Ibn Taymiyya certainly exploited the episode to denounce him and his defenders. Classical biographical literature is replete with accounts of this affair and its aftermath.31 Having shown that Ibn Taymiyya was prepared to criticise his Hanbali peers for approving of legal devices and concepts such as the use of hiyal and al-ihtiyat wa'l warac ('precaution and piety'), Matroudi looks at the fascinating issue of incorrect rulings which Ibn Taymiyya claimed were present in Hanbali fiqh. Authoritatively, Ibn Taymiyya was always able to explain why there existed such a large body of conflicting opinions within the Hanbali school (pp. 108-9). However, while the topics chosen by Matroudi reveal the influence that Ibn Taymiyya was able to exert on the various debates, to an extent, they also coincidentally show that a number of Hanbali luminaries were prepared to challenge consistently points of law which had been defended by Ibn Taymiyya.32 The reference to the sale and replacement of endowments provides an apposite example (pp. 113-4). Ibn Taymiyya took the view that it was permissible to sell or replace endowments without taking into account the aspect of yield; while Hanbali scholars had stressed that replacing endowments was only permissible in instances when the yield was unfruitful. The former view was defended by a student of Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Qad! al-Jabal; but he was vehemently criticised by the famous Jamal al-Din al-Mardawi (d. 769/1367), who stated that such a ruling was contrary to the general principles applied within the Hanbali school and even composed a refutation devoted to the question (p. 114). Obviously, Matroudi's point is that the opinion outlined by Ibn Taymiyya, along with many other similar revisions, was given currency within the later Hanbali tradition as a valid perspective of the school, which was certainly receptive to engaging in such discussions. The chapter moves on to explore the jurisprudential terminology of the Hanbali school; jurisprudential rules; narrations attributed to Ahmad ibn Hanbal and shown by Ibn Taymiyya to be incorrect; and, finally, actual narrations of Ibn Hanbal proved by Ibn Taymiyya to be incorrect. The ensuing analysis confirms that Ibn Taymiyya's</page><page sequence="11">98 Journal of Qur'anic Studies loyalties were not purely determined by the methodology, procedures and legal rulings defined by the Hanbali school, but rather by an adherence to what he believed to be an orthodox explication of the Qur'an and the Prophetic Sunna. It is in this context that Ibn Taymiyya's fastidiously rigorous attitude to the sources of law has to be understood. Moreover, it also defined his relationship with the Hanbali school. In Chapter Five of this text Matroudi reviews Ibn Taymiyya's influence upon later generations of Hanbali jurists. The individuals selected by Matroudi to highlight the extent of his influence within the later Hanbali tradition are Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350), Ibn Muflih (d. 763/1362), al-JuracI (d. 883/1478), al-Mardawi, al-Hajjawi (d. 968/1561), Ibn al-Najjar (d. 972/1564), al-Karmi (d. 1033/1623), al-Buhutl (d. 1051/1641), Ibn cAbd al-Wahhab (d. 1206/1791), al-SacdI (d. 1376/1976) and Ibn cUthaymin (d. 1421/2000). Regarding the most prominent of Ibn Taymiyya's students, Ibn Qayyim, the case is made that despite the latter figure's reverence for his mentor and his view of him as being an outstanding scholar in the fields of theology, Hadith and law, he did not slavishly emulate his teacher when dealing with legal discussions, a point also made by the ShaficI scholar and traditionist Ibn Hajar al cAsqalani (d. 852/1449) (p. 134). Matroudi reasons that Ibn Qayyim adopted the same analytical and independent approach to the synthesis of the sources of law advocated by his mentor and, as a result of this, he was often in disagreement with Ibn Taymiyya over a range of subjects (p. 135). Matroudi suggests that Ibn Qayyim was influenced in his jurisprudence by other prominent scholars, although his relationship with the Hanbali school of law was very similar in nature to that of Ibn Taymiyya. Having said that, Matroudi is appreciative of the fact that Ibn Qayyim does not cite his shaykh that frequently, despite his evidently being influenced by him. The renowned Ibn Muflih, who played a significant role in transmitting the legal legacy of Ibn Taymiyya, is shown to have occasionally disputed opinions and rulings reached by Ibn Taymiyya as well as questioning his use of proofs (p. 139). Indeed, on some issues he sided with the views adopted by certain Hanbali scholars against those of his mentor. Matroudi reasons that such individuals were encouraged by Ibn Taymiyya to be independent in their juridical thought as long as they honoured the authenticated sources of law and applied valid approaches to their synthesis and exposition. His view was that independent reasoning is obligatory for those who possess the skill and ability to scrutinise the legal sources.33 Within the framework of ijtihdd, if the ruling of a scholar contravened incontrovertible evidence, then it had to be discarded. Even with later figures such as Ibn Muflih and al-Mardawi, there was a tendency to quote extensively the opinions of Ibn Taymiyya; yet, for these two scholars, his views do not appear to have had an impact 'upon their jurisprudential opinions' (p. 169). Matroudi concludes that the legal thought of Ibn Taymiyya became a major focal point for Hanbali scholars, particularly as far as it was used to evaluate conventional positions on legal questions adopted within the school. Although it is interesting to note that,</page><page sequence="12">Book Reviews 99 according to the tables of citation included in this chapter, during the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries, Ibn Taymiyya's opinions were not cited with the same frequency by Hanbali scholars, nevertheless over ensuing centuries his work and thoughts enjoyed a resurgence, gaining greater currency in the writings of much later Hanbali luminaries. His approach to legal thought was enthusiastically accentuated within the reform movement led by Muhammad ibn cAbd al-Wahhab, although one might add that this individual was influenced even more profoundly by the brand of theological orthodoxy advocated by Ibn Taymiyya. The final chapter in Matroudi's work provides an in-depth examination on the subject of the 'intended triple divorce'. Ibn Taymiyya and his contribution to various aspects of Hanbali legal discourse has been covered extensively in Chapter Four of this book; however, due to the clamour surrounding this issue, Matroudi decided to devote a chapter to its discussion, describing it as one of the 'most significant jurisprudential issues in the life of Ibn Taymiyya' (p. 171). Ibn Taymiyya clashed on the issue with some of the leading jurists of his era, including revered Hanbali jurists, who argued that his legal opinion contravened the consensus among scholars, including the famous eponyms of the four classical schools of jurisprudence. The arguments concerning the 'intended triple divorce' were not concerned with the form of annulment in which a husband would pronounce the divorce of his wife three times separately and over three successive periods of waiting (fiddd) without any revocation: scholars had agreed that this form of divorce was binding (p. 172). The points of contention surrounded the following types of divorce: (i) instances in which the divorce was expressed three times in a single sitting, using the phrase anti taliq thaldtha; (ii) instances in which the form of divorce was expressed using three pronouncements in a single sitting such as 'anti taliq, anti taliq, anti taliq'; or 'anti taliq wa-tdliq wa-tdliq' in which either the wdw or the fa? was used as a conjunction; and (iii) instances in which the divorce was pronounced at three different times, but using the anti taliq formula once only. Ibn Taymiyya claimed that while many Hanbali jurists accepted the view that these forms of 'intended triple divorce' were prohibited and reprehensibly innovative, despite the fact that the narrations linked to Ibn Hanbal appeared to be at variance, they recognised them as being legally irrevocable34 and therefore binding. Ibn Taymiyya explained that such forms of triple divorce carried the efficacy of a single pronouncement and could not therefore be binding. He was perplexed by the fact that certain Hanbali scholars were prepared to deem such procedures of divorce innovative and impermissible, yet they would still maintain that they were legally binding (p. 174). In Ibn Taymiyya's view this went against the logic of dividing the forms of divorce into permissible and impermissible types, and he swiftly dismissed the scriptural evidences adduced by his opponents, arguing that a closer reading of the sources showed that the testimony they were citing had been taken out of its proper context (p. 175).</page><page sequence="13">100 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Examining the issue of whether Ibn Taymiyya's position on this subject was in opposition to the consensus of Hanbali scholars, Matroudi notes that Hanbali sources suggested there was no disagreement regarding the issue within the school but that Ibn Taymiyya had implied that some Hanbali scholars had previously questioned the efficacy of the triple divorce. Matroudi looks at legal sources which date back to the formative years of the Hanbali tradition and later materials which follow in the wake of Ibn Taymiyya's intervention into the subject. He notes that in the masa?il texts, Ibn Hanbal adopts the view that the 'intended triple divorce has the effect of three separate divorces'; it was thus binding (p. 177). The school simply preserved this view. The impression is that if disagreements did occur, then they were concerned with whether such divorces could be classed as being innovative. Scholars still spoke of them being binding, as the mukhtasar of al-Khiraqi shows, and indeed the commentary on this text by Ibn al-Banna (d. 471/1078); additionally, Ibn Qudama's cUmda does not refer to there being any disagreement concerning the binding nature of the triple divorce (p. 177). For Matroudi this poses the question of whether any Hanbali scholars actually subscribed to the view that the triple divorce was not binding. Ibn Taymiyya does mention that his grandfather al-Majd did take this view, yet, as Matroudi rightly concludes from his survey of the extant Hanbali sources, this was not a view adopted by any of the school's luminaries. This leaves the inevitable question as to why Ibn Taymiyya would claim that some Hanbali scholars queried whether the intended triple divorce was binding. Matroudi answers this in two ways: firstly, he suggests that it is possible that Ibn Taymiyya was alluding to the view of his grandfather, although it seems patently obvious that Ibn Taymiyya's reference to a second camp implies that he was invoking a body of earlier scholarship within the Hanbali school. Secondly, Matroudi assumes that Ibn Taymiyya was not referring to actual scholars who may have held this opinion but rather to the hypothetical existence of counter-positions sustained via elaborate referencing to Ibn Hanbal's inferred principles of jurisprudence (pp. 178-9). One would have to say that this argument is less than convincing. Nonetheless, it is the case that Ibn Taymiyya did propose that Ibn Hanbal's view, which predicated that the intended triple divorce was prohibited yet binding, did contravene the general legal principles applied by this individual. Ibn Qayyim was to assert later on that given the seniority of Ibn Taymiyya within the Hanbali school, his qawl (legal ruling) on the issue can justifiably be considered as one of the official positions of the school. Matroudi believes that Ibn Taymiyya was vindicated in maintaining that it was incorrect to state that consensus existed among all scholars regarding the binding nature of the triple divorce. Ibn Taymiyya was able to adduce the statements of many jurists outside the Hanbali school who equated the triple divorce with a single pronouncement (p. 182). Matroudi sums up this chapter by stating that Ibn Taymiyya's contribution to the discourse on this subject had its impact upon later attempts to resolve this point of law: subsequent scholars such as al-Hariri (d. 803/1400), Jamal al-DIn al-Imam (d. 798/1396) and al-Dawalibl (d. 862/1458) all</page><page sequence="14">Book Reviews 101 endorsed his view. Although the Hanbali legal sources uphold the view that the intended triple divorce 'amounts to an irrevocable divorce', a second opinion within the school was highlighted: this was the view advocated by Ibn Taymiyya and those who concurred with his reading of the sources. The issue of the intended triple divorce and Ibn Taymiyya's stance on this issue appositely encapsulate his traditionalist and critical approach to jurisprudence. This remained one of the defining features of his contribution to Hanbali juridical thought and legal discourse in general, overriding, whenever necessary, token loyalties to one specific school of thought. To sum up, this book will serve as a critical reference work for scholars and researchers wishing to gauge the complexity of the legacy bequeathed by Ibn Taymiyya to classical Hanbali legal discourse. It provides unique insights into the nature of this individual's relationship with the Hanbali school, showing that Ibn Taymiyya adopted Ibn Hanbal's jurisprudence and its applied methodology for the basic reason that, in his judgement, they enshrined the most orthodox approach to the interpretation of the law. Even in instances when he adopted positions which conflicted with accepted legal opinions within the school, Ibn Taymiyya was able to argue that the inferred usul of Ibn Hanbal substantiated his judgement. This very fact confirms the distinctly traditionalist streak which marks Ibn Taymiyya's legal and indeed theological thought. Matroudi's intimate knowledge and marshalling of the legal sources from the periods he covers are authoritative, and this is evident in the extensive range of legal themes and issues analysed in this book. His work is a welcome contribution to the library of academic studies on Islamic law. Mustafa Shah DOI: 10.3366/E1465359108000077 NOTES 1 The term encompasses an approach taken by more than one particular school of jurisprudence. See Wael Hallaq, A History of Islamic Legal Theories: An Introduction to Sunn! usul al-fiqh (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. \-4. The use of analogical reasoning (qiyds) became a defining feature of such schools. 2 It has been alleged that Ibn Hanbal capitulated under torture and that in the quest to construct a hierarchy of authority for SunnI Islam, later Arabic biographical sources purposely exaggerated his role during the mihna: see Michael Cooperson, Tbn Hanbal and Bishr al-Hafi: A Case Study in Biographical Traditions', Studia Islamica 86 (1997), pp. 71-101; Michael Cooperson, Classical Arabic Biography: The Heirs of the Prophet in the Age of al-Ma'mun (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); Nimrod Hurvitz, 'Schools of Law and Historical Context: Re-examining the Formation of the Hanbali madhhab\ Islamic Law and Society 7:1 (2000), pp. 37-64; Nimrod Hurvitz, 'Who is the Accused?

It should be noted that Michael Cooperson originally advanced the thesis that classical Arabic biography was used to enhance</page><page sequence="15">102 Journal of Qur'anic Studies the religious profile and status of Ibn Hanbal. Joseph van Ess pointed to the fact that Ibn Hanbal had capitulated under torture, referring to his being released from jail; other notable scholars remained in prison until the reign of al-Mutawakkil in 233/847. Cooperson has intimated that it is plausible that he may not have capitulated (Michael Cooperson, 'Two Abbasid Trials: Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Hunayn ibn Ishaq', Al-Qantara 22:2 (2001), pp. 375-93. 3 Wael Hallaq, The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 159. 4 al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl (d. 463/1071) made a number of stinging criticisms of the school's luminaries. 5 It is striking that a number of Ibn Hanbal's celebrated students who were active in the field of Hadith studies were the authors of sunan and so-called masaJil works. For example, one of these figures, Abu Dawud (d. 275/889), was the author of a Kitab al-sunan and he compiled a Kitdb al-masa'il al-Imam Ahmad, a miscellany of Ibn Hanbal legal anecdotes and discussions. One could argue that the form and content of the sunan works were predisposed towards a theoretical synthesis of traditions, promoting an applied gauging of their legal import. Given Ibn Hanbal's influence upon scholars such as Abu Dawud and al-Nasa3!, it seems implausible that Ibn Hanbal in his own right would not have been considered a jurist. 6 Abu cAbd Allah Shams al-Din ibn Qayyim, Flam al-muwaqqicin can rabb al-cdlamin, ed. Taha cAbd al-Ra3uf SacTd (4 vols, Beirut: Dar al-JTl, 1972), vol. 1, p. 28. Of course, it is the case that during the era of Ibn Hanbal the authorship of works in the fixed sense of the word was prevalent. In the field of Hadith literature Ibn Hanbal was among those who advocated the written codification of traditions as opposed to reliance on memory alone. 7 Gregor Schoeler, The Oral and the Written in Early Islam, tr. Uwe Vagelpohl, ed. and intr. James E. Montgomery, Routledge Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures (London: Routledge, 2006), p. 33. The basic construct of hostility to the recording of Hadith is particularly prominent in this respect and has been poured over in the research of Schoeler, Michael Cook and Joseph Kister; see Michael Cook, 'The Opponents of the Writing of Tradition in Early Islam', Arabica 44 (1997), pp. 437-530, reproduced in Michael Cook, Studies in the Origins of Early Islamic Culture and Tradition (Aldershot: Ashgate Variorum, 2004), (pp. i-iii), pp. 437-530; Joseph Kister, 'La taqraJu l-QurJana cala mushafiyyin wa-la tahmilu 'l~cilma cani l-sahafiyyin: Some Notes on the Transmission of Hadith', Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 22 (1998), pp. 127-62. Schoeler does import the issue of hostility towards the codification of traditions into the legal implications of this hostility. He claims that jurists wanted to retain greater flexibility in the interpretation of the legal sources, arguing that the ahl al-raDy were keen to avoid working within the framework of a fixed corpus of materials. The suggestion is that it would restrict the free development of the law. 8 Schoeler, The Oral and the Written, p. 116 and p. 126. 9 Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn CA1I al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl, Kitdb al-kifdya fi cilm al-riwaya (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-cIlmiyya, 1998), p. 228. 10 Schoeler, The Oral and the Written, p. 119. 11 See also Susan S.
