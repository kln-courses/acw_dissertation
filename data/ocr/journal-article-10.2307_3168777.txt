<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Prophecy in Carthage: Perpetua, Tertullian, and Cyprian. By CECIL M. ROBECK, JR.. Cleveland, Ohio. Pilgrim Press, 1992. xii + 329 pp. $29.95. Here is an excellent description and analysis of the "prophetic" movement at Carthage in the third century, well after it supposedly disappeared from Christianity. Robeck begins with the Martyrdom of Perpetua and continues through Tertullian to Cyprian who had visions but, according to Harnack, simply used them for political leverage. He calls Harnack's position "similar to a 'modern' secularist viewpoint" (p. 165), but the quotation then provided does not prove the point, whether or not "secularism" helps interpret aspects of early Christian institutions. Doubtless Harnack disliked his doctrine Nulla salus extra ecclesiam, even though (says Jerome) he said daily Da magistrum- meaning Tertullian. From time to time Robeck seems to gloss over the fights among the saints. Thus while he admits that "it is possible to argue that Montanism exhibited a low opinion of the clergy on a variety of occasions" (p. 82), he refers only to "the lack of submission to the bishops" recorded by Eusebius, not to an episcopal attempt to de-demonize Priscilla. The church seems a little more "spiritual," or even well-mannered, than it was. From his illuminating section on Tertullian's appeal to "contemporary visions" (pp. 128-39) Robeck omits his significant account of a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem (Against Marcion 3.24.3-4). "The coming of Jerusalem down from heaven is attested by Ezekiel (48:30-35), the apostle John (Rev. 21:2), and the word of the New Prophecy that even predicted that an image of the city would be seen before its reappearing, for a sign of the future." During the recent "oriental expedition" of Septimius Severus (perhaps 200-201), says Tertullian, gentile witnesses "too" confirmed that "in Judaea for forty days in pre-dawn moments a city with all its walls hung down from heaven but, as the day came on, vanished with nothing like it elsewhere" (thus recalling the "leave not a rack behind" of Shakespeare's Tempest). The word "too" shows that the report was confirmed by pagan witnesses but was Montanist in origin. Parenthetically, Robeck notes how often the young men in visions are unusually tall, and compares the remarkable height of the risen Jesus in the Gospel of Peter (pp. 65-68, 192-94). One may add that the book of Elchasai, perhaps written in the third year of Trajan's Parthian war (117), described two huge angels, the male Son of God and the female Holy Spirit. Both were ninety-six miles high with other measurements in proportion (compare Hippolytus Refutation 9.13.2-3). Epiphanius adds that the female stood between two mountains and that the heads of both reached the tops, supposedly a known height (Heresies 19.4.2). 378</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS Robeck has ably defended the presumed predecessors of modern Pentecos- tals. He reminds us that very orthodox churchmen can share in the world of dreams and visions (Ignatius of Antioch shows the same thing, without benefit of Montanism). The only item I can add to the extensive bibliography is Frederick C. Klawiter's unpublished 1975 Chicago dissertation, "The New Prophecy in Early Christianity: The Origin, Nature and Development of Montanism, A.D. 165-220," which deserves mention because it is not limited to evidence from Carthage. Chicago, Illinois ROBERT M. GRANT The Origenist Controversy: The Cultural Construction of an Early Christian Debate. By ELIZABETH A. CLARK. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. xii + 287 pp. $45.00. This fine book combines social and theological themes in discussing the fate of some of Origen's major ideas in the centuries soon after his death. The first chapter is concerned with "elite networks and heresy accusations," with an analysis of the complex interrelations among Origen's supporters and foes that reminds us of the late Ronald Syme's studies of the early Roman empire. The second chapter deals with Origen's idea of God as further developed by Evagrius Ponticus against the literalist "anthropomorphites." As Clark notes, several important bishops thought Epiphanius shared this heresy (compare Socrates, Church History 6.7-10). We then turn to the main charges against Origenism as leveled by Epiphanius, Theophilus of Alexandria, Jerome, and Shenute of Atripe. "Four polemicists, four Origenisms-but ... little sense of either Origenism's theological appeal or its coherence" (p. 158): four of the most unpleasant people in the early church. Therefore we turn to Rufinus's defense of Origenism, and finally to the transition from Origenism to Pelagianism. The comments on Epiphanius could be supplemented from Aline Pourkier's L'Heresiologie chez Epiphane de Salamine (Paris: Beauchesne, 1992), but this book appeared too late for use and would change little that Clark has said. Clark also insists that theological questions are important, though Ori- genists and their foes who sought a system in Origen's thought were not well advised, as Henry Courzel has argued. We note that Origen's theology would have seemed more obscure had some of his later homilies been known in the East. He really relaxed his rigidly anti-anthropomorphic vision of God and admitted human-like emotions in the deity (Father as well as Son) in some late homilies, but these writings survived in a Latin version presumably unknown to Greek opponents or to Greek Origenists like Evagrius. While in his homilies on Numbers (16.3; 23.2) Origen still held that God does not really rejoice and grieve, by the time he came to Ezekiel (Homily 6.6)- 379</page></plain_text>
