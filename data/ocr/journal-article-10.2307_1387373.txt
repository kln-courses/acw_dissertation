<plain_text><page sequence="1">Institutional Plausibility Alignment As Rhetorical Exercise: A Mainline Denomination's Struggle with the Exigence of Sexism JILL J. McMILLAN* Following the admonition of Peter Berger that members of the contemporary religious institution must periodically align themselves with prevailing social thought and practice, this case study analyzes the attempt of one group to reformulate the attitudes of its constituency on the subject of sexism. This study 1) reviews relevant literature on plausibility alignment; 2) argues that plausbility alignment is a rhetorical exercise; and using a systematic rhetorical analysis, 3) presents a case study of one major denomination's plausibility alignment exercise. The analysis reveals that in the throes of plausibility alignment, this group attempts to 1) identify and define the exigence; 2) address multiple audiences; and 3) "sell" an adjusted attitude toward sexism which balances the forces of accommodation and resistance. In his 1969 treatise, The Sacred Canopy, Peter Berger spoke a strange and unsettling message to the modem church: ". . . the religious tradition, which previously could be authoritatively imposed, now has to be marketed. It must be 'sold' to a clientele that is no longer constrained to 'buy' " (1969: 138). As if the market scenario were not unsavory enough, Berger's admonition to the modem church continues. Not only is it imperative that the successful religious group "compete" with other reality-defining agencies, they must do so continuously and adaptively. Now Berger has truly begun to meddle; to tell a religious body, which has not substantially altered its theological stance in over a thousand years, to adapt borders dangerously upon heresy. Berger explains his position, however, by describing the exstce of certain socially validated, continually fluctuating infrastructures - "plausibility structures" (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1966: 154-55) which underpin society.' While the pre- modem church seemed to be only peripherially affected by these plausibility structures, 1. Though plausibility structures are sometimes thought of as societal sub-groups, such is not necessarily the case. Aidala (1984) reminds us that plausibility structures can be diffused throughout society and united only by a common ideological commitment (e.g., liberated women, educational elitists, etc). When plausibility structures are mentioned in this study, the focus will be upon the unifying tenet of a sub-group, not upon the physical collectivity itself. Jill J. McMiUan is assistant professor in speech communication and theatre arts at Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. i Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1988, 27 (3) 326-344 326</page><page sequence="2">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 327 Berger insists that the competitive nature of contemporary religion requires that the religious group monitor and adjust to all issues residing within the social consciousness. Simply and pragmatically, Berger argues that now the church must attend to the subject of plausibility or "the sense of what people actually find credible. . ." (1970: 34). In the market model, if "shoppers" perceive the church to be expousing a message which is incongruent with their "everyday commonsense world" (Snow &amp; Machalek, 1982: 17), then they may choose other reality-defining possibilities, leaving the religious institution with declining membership, depleted resources, and waning influence. Given such high stakes, then, how is institutional plausibility alignment to proceed? We are offered no formulae, only cues. Berger and Luckman (1966) had suggested earlier that institutions are known by the symbols they keep; in other words, as groups, we are identified by what we say and do. Brown extends the notion and argues that institutions not only "have a code or language of their own ... they are a code; that is, they constitute a textual grammar and enactment, a system of signs as well as significations, a language as well as speech" (1987: 123; emphasis mine). To adapt, then, to changing societal conditions, modem institutions must change or adjust the symbols with which they are aligned. And institutional scholars must learn to "listen to" and to "read" institutions as well as to observe, to question, and to survey them. Shepherd and Shepherd (1984), for example, "listen to" the discourse of Morman leaders in order to determine the commitment strategies which had underpinned this highly successful religious group as they adjusted to over 150 years of human history. If plausibility alignment is only a matter of changing a few words here and there, why do human institutions approach plausibility alignment so fearfully and reluctantly? Perhaps the market metaphor cuts too deeply into our religious sensibilities; we can "sell" every day of the week in our various occupational arenas, but we do not like the idea of our priest, preacher or rabbi doing it. Perhaps, it seems inappropriate, even immoral, to strategize, to plan, especially to tamper with a theological position which supposedly did not originate with us in the first place. Or perhaps, we, as members of human institutions, simply do not know how to engage in plausibility alignment. It makes sense that our institutional philosophies should be appealing and somewhat consistent with the rest of our world, but most of our theological stances are based on hundreds of years of tradition and even upon Biblical imperative. Do we have any right to change them now even if we knew how? Unfortunately, Berger is silent at this point.2 He fails to tell us how to do plausibility alignment, simply that we must. Therefore it will be the purpose of this study to explore the institutional problem of plausibility alignment by 1) surveying the literature which underpins the concept of plausibility alignment; 2) presenting the argument that the loss of plausibility presents a rhetorical problem to the religious institution; and 3) advancing this argument through the case study of one major denomination's response to its plausibility dilemma. In 2. In later writing, A Rumor of Angels (1969) and The Heretical Imperative (1979), Berger discusses what he considers to be a superior option for negotiating religious traditionalism and modern secularism. He recommends the "inductive possibility" which reasserts the human being as the starting point for theological reflection and reaffirms the "supernatural and sacred character of religious experience" (1979: 154). In endorsing classical theological liberalism, Berger stands "without hestitation or embarrassment" (1979: xii) in the tradition of Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher.</page><page sequence="3">328 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION pursuing these goals, I hope to address several theoretical considerations: 1) to begin where Berger's analysis ends as to the means by which plausibility structures are actually changed; 2) to posit the notion of a sociological-rhetorical approach to plausibility alignment; and 3) to outline a methodological stance by which plausibility alignment can be analyzed and understood. THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL ROOTS OF PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT Beliefs The debate over how we come to believe as we do has not been confined to a particular intellectual or academic arena; each discipline with social scientific leanings has had its day at explaining the process. In sociology, there still is no consensus. Those who have accepted the notion that individuals are directed in some way to those ideas and reality- defining agencies which align with the basic tenets of their society find themselves in the tradition of Berger and Luckmann (1966), Bellah (1970), Geertz (1973), and Wuthnow (1981). Contrary evidence (Lofland, 1966; Zygmunt, 1970; Snow &amp; Machalek, 1982) suggests that the link between beliefs (at least, unconventional ones) and social validation is tenuous and relative, and may imply a vulnerability which is compensated for by other self-validating mechanisms of the religious group. Cognitive Dissonance The dilemma concerning beliefs is formidable enough when they stand still, which, of course, they never do. As society changes - daily, hourly, momentarily - so do the basic tenets which underpin our collective lives. For a time the change is imperceptible, but eventually we are forced to face an individual or an institutional stance which is clearly outdated, inappropriate, unworkable. This misalignment may take the form of an attitude about minorities, or a stand on abortion, or a belief about sexual customs and mores. Whatever the issue, this is the point at which Berger insists that human beings or human institutions must engage in plausibility alignment. At the individual psychological level, this misalignment may be accompanied by cognitive dissonance (Festinger et aL, 1956), that state of psychological discomfort which occurs when our cognitive state is disrupted and challenged by some alien event or piece of information. Research has shown that individuals will strive to alleviate the discomfort of new, unsettling information in numerous ways, often changing or altering belief structures to do so. Sociologists of religion have been interested in cognitive dissonance as a variable to help explain how and why individuals adopt, maintain, and/or abandon beliefs. However, recent work has challenged the viability of cognitive dissonance as an explanatory principle, especially in the case of unconventional beliefs. Benassi (1980) found occult belief to be highly durable and somewhat insulated from competing or disconfirming ideas. Snow and Machalek (1982) report similar patterns in Nichiren Shoshu converts, and they argue, not that there is an absence of cognitive dissonance in the construction and maintenance of belief systems, but that sometimes beliefs remain intact because</page><page sequence="4">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 329 "disconfirming evidence, however compelling to the nonbeliever, goes unnoticed by the believer" (1982: 23). Regardless of the exact role which cognitive dissonance plays in the adaptation of beliefs, it does seem probable that the same human instinct which compels the individual to adjust a personal belief may also be at work when potentially disconfirming information invades our collective life. Open Systems Another theoretical underpinning which can be claimed by plausibility alignment lies in the tenets of open systems theory, and may help to explain why a group is willing to adapt once it has experienced some sense of dissonance. Positing much higher stakes than temporary psychological discomfort, open systems theorists have repeatedly implored the system to "adapt or die" (Boulding, 1956). Just as the biological system must take its life-giving energy from the environment which surrounds it, so must a social system. Furthermore, this critical energy - whether in the form of natural resources, personnel, or information - is not automatic or assured (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978); its flow requires constant monitoring and continual negotiation between the social system and prominent sources within its environment (Adams, 1976; 1980). In short, any group or collectivity must be ever ready to change its course in the face of critical information from its environment. Hannan and Freeman (1984) recently identified the adaptation model as accounting for roughly two thirds of the literature on organizational change, with one school of thought insisting that such change is based on the rational thought and strategic planning of organizational decision makers, and the other arguing that change is a serendipitous process, only loosely coupled to any grand organizational design. Both positions affirm, however, that organizations have learned well the open systems imperative to adapt or die. Brannon applies the open systems concept specifically to the religious organization when he insists that these groups must "please" the internal and external sources of their resources and support (Brannon, 1971: 31). The Corporate Stance While belief at the individual level has been the subject of numerous studies, the corporate stance of a group or collectivity has been more elusive to social scientific investigators. And understandably so. How does one go about assessing the corporate mentality? We may hear that "Exxon takes the position that. . ." or "The University of Maryland confirms that.. .." or "The Methodist Church believes that ... ." Furthermore, there are reams of official organizational rhetoric in the form of press releases, company magaznes, position statements, annual reports, etc. which are expended regularly in behalf of a group. These "organizational documents" (Johnson, 1982), which are addressed "To whom it may concern" and signed "The Organization," present a particularly difficult problem to the scientist because of the absence of accountability. Who gets to "speak" for a group or organization? Does one member of a sect proclaiming on the street corner represent the group's philosophy? When Lee Iacocca makes an address or a statement,</page><page sequence="5">330 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION can we assume that the Chrysler corporation has spoken? Or perhaps there is some sort of mathematical formula to explain organizational rhetoric in which the belief statements of three middle managers are equal to those of one vice president or four church school teachers are equal to one minister? And what does the social scientist do with those individuals who want to claim membership in an organization but refuse to embrace its philosophy? Finally, when the group philosophy becomes outmoded, how does it change? Only a few studies have considered the corporate responses of a religious group to its environment. Gibbs and Ewer analyzed leadership and organizational adaptation and concluded that the church must "(1) recognize issues which are relevant to the larger community and (2) make some kind of response in terms of programs and activities" (1969: 224). Wood (1970) also focused on leadership in his study of 28 major religious bodies and found that the strength of policy in the area of racial integration varies directly with the degree of leader authority; when organizational leadership is strong and secure, the organization speaks boldly. Takayama and Sachs (1976) studied local churches' policy decisions to open church-related private schools in response to court-ordered busing. They found that "when environmental pressures call for church action, the congregational church [as opposed to hierarchical ones] may more easily reflect this pressure" (275-76). The authors explain this phenomenon by suggesting that in the congregational polity, the local church is the single source of authority and the sentiments and interests of members are consonant. The sources of authority in the hierarchical group, on the other hand, may be far removed and unaligned with local beliefs and attitudes. The Rhetorical Position Though they stopped short of a specific explanation, Berger and Luckmann were the first to suggest that plausibility alignment is a linguistic exercise for the modern institution. Institutions, and the numerous organizations which constitute them, face the repeated demand to explain, to justify, and to legitimize themselves to both internal and external constituencies, and language becomes the chief tool in the process (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1966: 61). This language may constitute the Sunday morning sermon, or the latest position statement of the group, or the content of the church school curriculum. In more recent writings, Berger offers an explanation for this rhetorical imperative with which the church is faced. He suggests that in the process of church/state separation, the religious institution lost any real enforcement power it may have had (Berger, 1969: 130); thus it is unable to levy taxes, raise armies, and generally define the everyday existence of its citizenry. Roderick Hart in his book The Political Pulpit (1977) agrees with Berger and goes on to suggest that for the modern church in America, the remaining power tool lies in the realm of the rhetorical. Action is no longer a viable motivator; discourse becomes the primary means of "adjusting ideas to people and people to ideas" (Bryant, 1953: 26). In short, we are what we say, and it is the symbolic rendering of an institution that establishes its position in the institutional marketplace and "sells" itself to prospective buyers. Words become the unit of analysis, and institutional power becomes rhetorical power. And if Donald Bryant is correct in calling rhetoric the process of adjusting ideas to people and people to ideas, then it is the religious group which most successfully</page><page sequence="6">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 331 "adjusts" itself and its position that should possess the competitive edge in the institutional competition for recruits, resources, and allegiance. Though both the sociological and rhetorical communities seem to regard plausibility alignment as a rhetorical exercise, rhetorical scholars have been slow to invade the realm of institutional rhetoric. From 4th century Greece until recent times, their primary unit of analysis was the individual rhetor. In his 1952 treatise, "The Rhetoric of Historical Movements," Leland Griffin argued that rhetorical analysis should be expanded to include groups and their public talk. What followed was truly a proliferation of social movement studies, reaching a peak in the late 60's and early 70's when society was bombarded with groups seeking action and change (Simons, Mechling &amp; Schreier, 1984). Still, scholars focused upon the naysayers of society, whose coming and going on the social scene was fairly discrete, whose duration was limited and brief, and whose primary message was predictably reactionary. Only in the recent past have rhetorical scholars insisted that rhetorical analysis be extended to those "crusty old institutions which have endured" (McMillan, 1982: 2). This interest in institutional rhetoric, fraught as it may be with theoretical and methodological problems, is especially important to the study of plausibility alignment because it is likely that the older, more enduring organizations are the ones which have faced the greatest number of change situations in their extended histories. Furthernore, if Berger's admonition concerning the critical nature of plausibility alignment holds true, there may even be some correlation between successful adjustment and organizational survival. The Rhetorical Situation Understanding of plausibility alignment as a rhetorical exercise is enhanced by discerning those elements which constitute what Lloyd Bitzer calls a "rhetorical situation": Rhetorical situation may be defined as a complex of persons, events, and relations presenting an actual or potential exigence which can be completely or partially removed if discourse, introduced into the situation, can so constrain human decision or action as to bring about significant modification of the exigence (Bitzer, 1968: 45). Bitzer identifies the major components of the rhetorical situation as an exigence - "an imperfection marked by urgency ... a defect, an obstacle, ... a thing that is other than it should be" (Bitzer, 1968: 43); and audience - those agents of change to whom the discourse is directed; and constraints, or ... persons, objects, events and relations which are part of the situation because they have the power to constrain decision and action needed to modify the exigence. Standard sources of constraint include belief, attitudes, documents, facts, traditions, images, interests, motives and the like. . . (Bitzer, 1968: 44). Finally, discourse injected into the situation represents the catalyst for change or resolution. All of the ingredients of the rhetorical situation are present in the plight of the modem day religious group: the exigence which faces it squarely is periodically and repeatedly to align some current plausibility structure with that of the society with which it is coexisting; the audience consists of those individuals who are either direct or indirect</page><page sequence="7">332 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION recipients of the church's message; and constraints are all of those elements, whether physical or attitudinal, which would impede the church's successful change from one philosophical position to another. Discourse, in the form of any message which the religious group expends, constitutes, according to Berger, Hart and others, the only competitive weapon available. Summary Modernity, with its pluralistic options, has created a marketplace scenario in which even the religious institution must compete for resources and recruits. Berger believes that successful competition for the religious group depends upon its ability to change or to shore up crumbling plausibility structures which society endorses and upon which members depend. Since the church no longer enjoys any real enforcement power, some scholars have suggested that its primary resource lies in the realm of the rhetorical - that it simply must talk its constituency into acceptance and commitment. If such is the case, then the components of the rhetorical situation which Bitzer has posited should be present and active in the modern day religious discourse. In the case study which follows, I will demonstrate that the loss of plausibility does, in fact, present a rhetorical problem to the religious organization, and will describe the response of one religious denomination to its plausibility dilemma. A CASE STUDY Berger's discussion of institutional adjustment and change stops short of exploring the specific mechanisms of plausibility alignment, but he does offer many valuable clues. By juxtaposing Berger's discussion with a systematic rhetorical analysis, I analyzed a position paper of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS).3 The artifact was a thirty page document created by the PCUS Council on Theology and Culture entitled "Language About God," and was commissioned by the 116th General Assembly of the church in 1979 with the following mandate: To consider the roots of our language about God and the feasibility of developing new language or language usage responsive to both our confessional history and our contemporary situation (Minutes of the General Assembly, 1976: 216). The "Language About God" (LAG) document became an official pronouncement of the church when it was adopted by the highest ruling body of the PCUS in June, 1980. The rhetorical analysis of the PCUS document4 included the following procedures: identification and quantification of major themes (e.g., "community of believers," "sexism," 3. The Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) was at this juncture the Southern branch of the denomination. In 1983 the PCUS joined with its sister church the United Presbyterian Church to form the Presbyterian Church (USA). 4. A general outline of the document is as follows: reflections on the general importance of language; a statement concerning the proper authority for language about God; a review of pertinent Biblical data; discussion of the importance of creeds and liturgies; an analysis of the contemporary situation in which the subject is addressed; and some general recommendations about linguistic options which the church might consider.</page><page sequence="8">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 333 "Biblical imperative"); isolation of argumentative patterns (e.g., Toulnin's warrant, claim, grounds, support for grounds); creation of a taxonomy of linquistic devices (e.g., metaphor, simile, analogy); location, description of the various sources of authority or support for argument (e.g., The Larger Catechism, social references, Bible); analysis of overall message structure (e.g., noting placement choices, primacy/recency considerations); and categorization and appraisal off rhetorical choices and strategies (e.g., inclusion of subject matter, selection of document name, tone of message, style of presentation, assessment and approach to audience). The analysis yielded the following conclusions: When confronted with a crumbling plausibility structure, this religious institution attempted to: 1) identify and define the exigence. 2) address multiple audiences - internal traditionalists, external society, and "partially included" individuals. 3) "sell" a new religious world view which balances the forces of accommodation and resistance. Identification and Definition For Bitzer, an exigence is "a thing not as it should be"; for Berger that misalignment occurs at any point at which the church no longer has a relevant word to say about politics or social problems or any subject residing within the public consciousness. Apparently, it was the PCUS leadership who first experienced a sense of exigence concerning sexism because the creation of the Council on Theology and Culture6 itself represents a sort of "exigence watchdog" as reflected in its organizational mandate: a. to respond to overtures of a theological and/or social nature which call for explanation and guidance. b. to bring together task force groups from the church to study issues of a theological and social nature. c. to submit to the General Assembly occasional papers dealing with theology and its application to contemporary issues. (From Organization Plan of General Assembly Agencies) In the language of organizational theory, the Council's job is to be one of boundary scanning, in which a system installs mechanisms which monitor environmental cues and reports back critical information which may cause the system to alter or correct its course (Adams, 1976, 1980). In this particular case, the Council is to focus its attention upon the points at which church/societal interface is ocurring. Any real or potential breakdown between the two entities then becomes the subject for the Council's, and ultimately, the 5. The Council on Theology and Culture was nominated by the Permanent Nominating Committee of the PCUS. Specific criteria for selection included these considerations: balance of clergy/laity; professional/non-professional; male/female; a regional cross section; some age variation; a balance among seminary representatives; and a variety of professional specializations. Interestingly, the twelve-member class of 1979-80 was exceedingly balanced except in one category - there were only three females to nine males. This information was obtained from personal communication from Phyllis Burroughs, Administrative Assistant, Council on Theology and Culture, Presbyterian Church (USA), December 28,1987; and from Dr. Eugene March, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, December 15, 1987.</page><page sequence="9">334 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION church's, consideration.6 Emerging from the Council's mandate are two imporant points which offer support for a rhetorical/sociological hypothesis of plausibility alignment: 1) that the PCUS must maintain communication with society; and 2) that discourse will be the primary tool for that process. It was through the boundary scanning process that the "Language About God" document came into being. On the surface, the Council's job seems like a relatively easy one - watch for trouble spots and report them - and the PCUS comes across as an alert and adaptive system. However, John Dewey and a host of other people watchers have reminded us that problem identification in and of itself is no simple task (Dewey, 1910). We may sense a problem and even recognize the general area in which it resides; precise identification and accurate articulation of that problem, however, represent substantially more formidable tasks (Maier, 1963; Hirokawa, 1983). Furthermore, even if the Council succeeds in correctly locating and describing the problem, it still may not "count as" a significant exigence to the church at large. Apparently the Council must convince its constituency that there is, in fact, an exigence, and that attitudes and beliefs must be altered to accommodate it. The natural resistance of human beings to change has been widely documented in many arenas; it can be especially potent when religious beliefs are challenged. For example, the typical person in the pew may have been socialized, even theologically indoctrinated, in accordance with a prevailing plausiblity structure (e.g., "Males constitute the vast majority of religious leadership"). As recently as 1950, such a precept was common and rarely challenged (Abingdon, 1981; Reuther &amp; Keller, 1981). Furthermore, wider societal behavior and practice did not significantly challenge or weaken such mentality. For the PCUS Council, some brief thirty years later, to inform its membership that a sexist plausibility structure is problematic and can no longer be tolerated is, to some, startling and tantamount to heresy. These members grew up with the traditional plausibility structure; more importantly, they most likely wove that philosophy inextricably into their personal belief and practice. To change their orientation might be likened to extracting and replacing a prominent thread in a tightly woven fabric. The tradition of psychological balance theory has repeatedly reinforced the fact that the status quo position is normally a comfortable one, not easily changed (Heider, 1958). Also, the warning of exigence may be inconsistent with the theological grounding of the individual. In short, because the social reality of the church member may be threatened by the prospect of change, the Council's job from the beginning becomes an inherently persuasive one - to define the exigence so as to assure its best possible hearing. Faced with the first problem of identifying and defining the exigence, the Council employs some interesting rhetorical strategies. First, the Council utilizes an exigence disguise - the document's title is "Language About God"; the document's subject matter is sexism. Perhaps a moderate title, consistent with organizational ideology, will make a better first impression on PCUS members than would a controversial one. At least members might be enticed to consider the Council's admonition; to entitle the document accurately might ensure that it never receives a hearing. Not only does the Council set 6. Sexism is only one of many subjects which the Council uncovered as possible trouble spots in the church/societal interface. A review of other areas of concern for the Council includes abortion, homosexuality, drug abuse, amnesty, etc.</page><page sequence="10">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 335 up the disguise in the title of the document, it is maintained throughout the major portion of the paper, with discussion concerning the importance of language in general, proper authority for language about God, a review of relevant Biblical data, etc. The real and underlying exigence, sexism, is not overtly revealed until near the end of the treatise after much persuasive groundwork has been laid for its introduction. In employing the disguise and in delaying the introduction of the controversial kernel of the document, the Council is acknowledging that the persuasiveness of a message may be affected by its placement in the total context of a document (Hovland, 1957). The Council apparently assesses its audience as more positive toward a linguistic treatise and evaluation than toward the issue of sexism, and reasons that the journey over the less threatening terrain of language would render the audience more accepting of the inevitable exigence of sexism. The definition of the exigence is also facilitated by the clear "creation" of an internal audience7 and the use of the appropriate tone in which to address them. Rhetorical critics have suggested that each piece of discourse reveals a characteristic audience for which its message is intended. Through stylistic choices, patterns of argument, choice of supporting material, etc., the successful rhetor seeks to tailor a message for the specific audience which he or she imagines. One measure of rhetorical success then becomes that degree of alignment between the actual physical audience and their characteristics and the image of audience which the rhetor has implanted and the discourse reveals. The style of the LAG document suggests an internal membership which the Council respects. According to the language which was utilized, the messagemakers see their membership as intelligent, sensitive, theologically conservative, and rational, and they reason, as did Aristotle about receivers in general, that if given the facts, this membership could recognize a weakened theological position and could make a reasonable and responsible decision concerning it. Consequently, the tone with which they choose to address the church is a didactic one, and their teaching involves both linguistic and theological subject matter. Roughly one-fourth of the thirty-page document functions in highly instructional fashion to inform the audience of developments between church and society pertaining to problems with language, and indicates that the writers understood implicitly what communication experts have confirmed, i.e., that self-persuasion yields the most effective and long-lasting attitude change (Monroe &amp; Ehninger, 1978). If the internal constituency learns its lesson well, they will complete the establishment and the significance of the exigence in their own minds, and the first problem of the Council will be solved. Thus, in the process of institutional plausibility alignment, the mere presence of an exigence in society, no matter how serious, does not assure its prominence in the minds of members. In fact, the exigence (in this case, sexism) which is threatening institutionally may be perceived as inconsequential, even a non-issue, to the individual member. The rhetorical task of organizational spokespersons then is, not only to locate and to name the exigence, but also to present the unique institutional interpretation of it. 7. See Black (1970) and Campbell (1972: 15, 18) for a discussion of the manner in which discourse "reveals" the audience which is residing in the mind of the rhetor/s and for whom the message is intended.</page><page sequence="11">336 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Addressing Multiple Audiences Bitzer said that there must be people to receive word of the exigence - people whose choices and decision-making capabilities render them potential agents of change. Tailoring a message for a familiar, homogeneous audience like its own PCUS membership is problem enough for the Council, but plausibility alignment calls for even greater rhetorical artistry. The LAG document reveals the presence of at least three audiences whose attitudes and orientation contain some fundamental differences. First, there are the internal tritionalists - church members whose theological belief system is most likely firmly grounded in the existing plausibility structure (in this case, clear and distinct interpretations of male/female roles, a masculine diety, and a tradition of Biblical direction and liturgical practice which is clearly male-dominated). The second audience - less clearly defined and less specifically courted - but nonetheless present is external society, a sizable portion of which is demanding new, relevant possibilities in the interpretation of the roles of both sexes. For want of more definite descriptors, we might employ systems terminology to classify members of this second audience as in- habitants of the external system which surround the religious body. Finally, the third, and in many ways the most problematic, audience is partially included (Parsons, 1960) in both the internal and external positions which the Council addresses. While basically endorsing traditional Presbyterian doctrine, they also support anti-sexist philosophy and practice. A look at each of these audiences demonstrates the rhetorical distance between them. As for the internal audience, its members most likely cut teeth on the existing plausibility structure concerning sex roles and behavior. Traditional tenets probably shape and give meaning to each person's religious ritual and practice, perhaps even his or her theological world view. To question a long-held, fundamental belief, whatever its subject matter, may create a serious psychological crisis for the members. More important organizationally, such a declaration risks alienation of those very members whose commitment and resources are necessary for organizational survival. The internal audience receives by far the most attention in the LAG document. Not only are they drawn clearly and respectfully in the language and style of the message, two other major rhetorical strategies are utilized in their behalf. First, the writers of the document seek to build common ground with their fellow members. Rhetoricians have long recognized that for a speaker to establish that he or she is "one of them" is to increase the probability of a fair hearing from an audience. Lingli and Kuykendall (1978) suggest that Presbyterians are a group to whom the concept of community and tradition has been historically significant. The Council recognizes the fertile ground of commonality when it devotes an entire section to the importance of creeds and liturgies, mentioning specific examples which are familiar to all Presbyterians (e.g., The Apostle's Creed, The Nicene Creed, and The Westminster Confession of Faith). The internal constituency is also courted by an abundance of inclusion language: "we"/"our"; "sisters and brothers in the faith"; "those of us who"; "all of us know." The common ground and inclusion strategies carry a subtle subscript. Not only do they seek to build trust and to make the receiver feel comfortable in the throes of a difficult psychological and cognitive dilemma, they also draw the common cords of relationship more tightly and render it abhorrent to abandon a longstanding commitment.</page><page sequence="12">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 337 Since the LAG document clearly is not intended directly for them, the second group of hearers may be thought of as those individuals outside church boundaries (or the exteral audience), ostensibly representing the position of sexual enlightenment which challenges traditional Presbyterian thought and practice. In a sense, individuals within this audience are "overhearing" the Presbyterian plausibility struggle and may be only indirectly and belatedly affected by it, if at all. Not to be ignored, however, this audience carries within it critical sources of energy - personnel, money, information - as well as potential recruits on which the church must depend (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978). The PCUS apparently recognizes that it must not only "speak" to this environment, it must make its case well. Complicating the rhetorical dilemma of the Council is the fact that it must address both major audiences at once, and with only one document. The typical member of the second audience does not share the religious history and orientation of the first; in fact, this individual may have no religious inclination at all. Therefore, the abundance of words which have been spent on building community within the religious group is lost on the individual member of the external audience. In fact, he or she may feel excluded from the obvious "inclusion" language directed at church members and may feel generally alienated by the rhetoric of a closed religious system (Hart, 1984). Since the external audience contains agents of potential energy for the religious group, alienation of these individuals is not a posture which the contemporary church can afford. Despite the obvious capitulation to the external audience which is inherent in the project itself, the Council's rhetorical posture is a curious one. They opt to throw the weight of sheer volume behind internal concerns, leaving only the tag ends to the listening external audience. The following examples represent the only explicit acknowledgement of the societal position which gave rise to the whole exercise in the first place: Today the Church addresses and is addressed by a culture in which people are becoming increasingly aware of a variety of forms of sexism ... ; some recognize that references to God in the church have all too often been an occasion for the self-promotion of men and the disparagement and exclusion of women.... Some men and women interpret efforts to alter language usage as, at worst, an attack upon basic institutions and, at best, inconsequential (24). To the casual observer, these meager offerings to the external position may seem insignificant, even insulting, in light of the varied and complex manifestations of sexism in contemporary society; the more sympathetic observer might reason, however, that in the mere existence of the document, the PCUS has given to its own people "a battle," but conceded to its external audience "the war." Finally, there emerge from the LAG document some listeners who are partially included in both audiences (Parsons, 1960). They count themselves as faithful Presbyterians and anti-sexists as well, but the discourse suggests that the ranks of those progressive members are small and relatively insignificant in the total denominational scheme of things. Despite uncertainty about the size and influence of this audience, the Council opts to address it, primarily in the form of legitimizing strategies. Twice within the discourse, the Council acknowledges the resistant forces and seeks to soothe and placate them by such approaches as: "For some, the issue [anguage about God or sexism, whichever the receiver chooses to insert] is provoked by painful wrestling. For others, the issue is more an irritant, a threat or merely irrelevant. For still others, the questions raise theological issues of great importance which require some resolution.... "Clearly, these words are</page><page sequence="13">338 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION meant for Presbyterians bothered by the issue of sexism, and in employing them, the Council acknowledges, even encourages, the right of its members to hold divergent views. Furthermore, the specific statement of each argument of resistance, rather than a general, overriding dismissal, gives additional worth to each possible position. Because of such rhetorical equivocation by the Council, the partially included receiver may become willing to extend his or her latitude of acceptance (Eagly &amp; Telaak, 1972) to include a new, negotiated appraisal of sexism. Establishing a comfortable place to stand for this third audience is doubly important because it is most likely from their ranks, however small, that a more sexually enlightened policy and practice will come. The Council dares not jeopardize their support and good will. In some ways, this ubiquitous third audience improves the climate of plausibility alignment by providing some common threads with which to unite segments of both audiences; in other respects, their presence exacerbates the Council's rhetorical task because it creates middle-of-the-road monitors who are in a position to hear and to judge the integrity of the rhetoric directed at both camps. In effect, the third audience functions to keep PCUS spokespersons honest. The LAG document confirms Bitzer's notion of the presence of an audience to receive and to act on information about an exigence. The unique addition made to the concept of audience in institutional plausibility alignment is that the receivers constitute multiple audiences, all of whom have potential power over the destiny of the institution. The two most distinct and prominent audiences are composed of the internal traditionalists and external society, but the writers of the "Language About God" document are aware of an amorphous third audience whose sentiments are uncertain but who occupy a key, pivotal position between the two ideological extremes. Seling a New World View: A Balance of Accommodation and Resistance A final element of Bitzer's rhetorical situation which has yet to be mentioned specifically but whose presence has pervaded this analysis is the notion of constraint - per- sons, objects, events, relations which possess the power to modify or act on the exigence; the process of plausibility alignment seems fraught with it - from outdated attitudes to unwilling members to truculent onlookers. In fact, the presence of constraint so pervades each rhetorical choice made by the Council that it becomes useful for us to prioritize. Clearly the aspect of plausibility alignment which most constrains these writers and spokespersons is the application of marketplace strategy to theological content. Page after page the message rings through loud and clear - "We know that we must adjust and adapt, but the process is so painful. How do we begin to 'sell' a new world view and remain faithful to our historical and traditional interpretations at the same time?" Though he never said it, Peter Berger must have known that plausibility alignment would be a painful process. He knew that his market scenario cut deeply into the religious sensibilities of his hearers as he described religious messages as subjects of "fashion"; ecumenicity as "cartelization"; and the desperate retention of traditional beliefs as "product loyalty" of "old customers" (Berger, 1969: 143-45). He knew, long before Bitzer and the rhetorical situation, that the constraint which would cry out for resolution to the PCUS</page><page sequence="14">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 339 Council is how to play the game of the marketplace and still be true to the church's traditional foundations. Furthermore, the burden of Berger's admonition is not lessened by his suggested solution. He sees the church's option as two-fold, either accommodation or resistance: The pluralistic situation presents the religious institution with two ideal-typical options. They can either accommodate themselves to the situation, play the pluralistic game of religious free enter- prise, and come to terms as best they can with the plausibility problem by modifying their product in accordance with consumer demands. Or, they can refuse to accommodate themselves, entrench themselves behind whatever socio-religious structures they can maintain or construct new, and continue to profess the old objectives as much as possible as if nothing had happened (Berger, 1964: 153). In later writing, Berger softens his bi-polar position to admit that "extreme choices ... not only are rare, they are particularly unlikely to be adopted by sizable institutions with a variety of vested interests in social survival" (1969: 26). He suggests that a more likely institutional strategy would be "limited, controlled accommodation" which he defines as a "bargaining process with modern thought, a surrender of some traditional ... items while others are kept" (26). The LAG document stands as evidence of the accuracy of Berger's assumption. While one might argue that the mere existence of the document suggests accommodation on the part of the church, the discourse itself reveals that the PCUS also finds it impossible to turn back on its traditional and theological roots. It chooses, instead, to attempt to balance the elements of accommodation and resistance - "bargaining" its way through the alignment process. A review of the macro-strategy of the document reveals how the writers wove their words in and out of the interests and concerns of all of their listening publics. First, there is the identification and unique interpretation of the exigence: The controversial subject of sexism is masqueraded as the moderate subject, i.e., language about God. In the meantime, the Council is able to establish common ground with its membership by the use of inclusion terms ("we/our"; "all of us," etc.) and symbols of community ("affirmations of the Church Universal"; "agreement within particular communities," etc.). To counteract the partisan rhetoric, the Council also includes arguments which afford credence to the position of the societal audience while legitimizing the doubts and misgivings of some few internal members ("painful personal wrestling"; "questions of great importance"). The basic tone of the document is respectful of its receivers, affirming that they are capable of a wise and rational decision, and the writers carefully instruct their audience about the background and development of each notion. The gentle, didactic spirit is enhanced by the use of moderate, undefensive language ("modest recommendations"; "more nearly adequate language"). Such language choice assures the external and the partially included audience that something is being done about the crumbling plausibility foundations of sexism. To the internal traditionalists, the moderate language increases the credibility of the Council and assures church members that it is safe to continue this language exploration together. The Council could be trusted not to lead them too far astray. While the Council is soothing its audience with reassuring language and content, it is also adopting an argumentative posture which takes into account the variance in the belief systems of its listeners. Analyzing the document through the Toulmin (1984) format of Claim-Warrant-Grounds reveals numerous examples in which all three parts of the</page><page sequence="15">340 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION argument were provided (i.e., MAJOR CLAIM - "We Should change our attitudes on sexism"; WARRANT - "The Bible does not promote sexism"; GROUNDS - "Presbyterians adhere to the Bible"). Hart (1972) found that normally within a committed, homogeneous group (like a religious sect), discourse will reflect an argumentative shortcut which assumes and relies upon a common philosophical background. Within such rhetoric, the warrant is often assumed and thus omitted, and there may also be minimal evidence provided to support the claim. On the other hand, when speakers perceive their audience as uncommitted, even hostile, they are careful to supply specifically the necessary warrant and sufficient evidence to strengthen the possibility for acceptance of their claim. The LAG discourse reveals an unusually high count of supplied warrants and supporting evidence, suggesting that its writers rejected the option of an abbreviated argument which would have sufficed for many of its hearers in favor of the more laborious and extended version which might be necessary to persuade the non-member and the ambivalent members. To balance its basic accommodation to societal demands, the Council moves on to devote roughly two-thirds of the document to the reaffirmation of its theological tradition. The posture assumed theologically aligns with the neo-orthodox position of the theologian, Karl Barth, in which the authority of tradition is reaffirmed and endorsed. Berger describes it this way: In the neo-orthodox experience, that is the reconversion experience, the authority of tradition is regained. It becomes subjectively real to the individual and can be perceived again as objective reality (1979: 92-93). Examples of this position from the document include: "Scripture on authority"; "analysis of the biblical language of God is essential"; or "scripture must be preserved in translation and interpretation." The message is clear. No matter how much the Council feels compelled to "sell" to its constituency a new and relevant plausibility structure, it refuses to do so at the point of theological compromise. Only after this long, painstakingly plotted journey of persuasion does the Council feel free to reveal its underlying purpose. The last few pages of the document represent the Council's only explicit address to the external audience (e.g., "culture. . . becoming increasingly aware of ... sexism"; "references to God ... have all too often been for . . . the self-promotion of men and the disparagement of women"). Finally, it is possible to admit that sexism in society is the real problem, and language is only one manifestation of it. But even then the approach is hesitant and guarded, as demonstrated in these examples: "Some willingness to accommodate"; "whether we like it or not"; "some hesitancy and outright resistance." Apparently some still must be dragged, kicking and screaming, into dialogue with a waiting society. Although Berger originally described the options of the contemporary religious group as bi-polar - accommodation or resistance - such was not the case for the PCUS. In their attempt to adapt the crumbling plausibility structure of sexism, they sought the middle ground upon which to build their case. Rather than create a strong, custom-made message for the audience which they knew and upon which they were most dependent, they chose to attempt to speak to all hearers, continually weaving their appeal in and out of the interests and concerns of each group.</page><page sequence="16">INSTITUTIONAL PLAUSIBILITY ALIGNMENT AS RHETORICAL EXERCISE 341 CONCLUSION Though this study is limited to an analysis of only one institution's plausibility struggle, I believe that it has offered us some valuable insights into the nature of the process which may serve as a foundation for future investigation. Furthermore, if the systemic commonality of all groups holds true, then Berger's marketplace mentality would predict that we would find similar aligning patterns in organizations of all types and varieties. Certainly the extension of the study of plausiblity alignment to sociological institutions of other genres is a logical next step in this investigation. From the argument which has been advanced in this study and a careful analysis of a major denomination's struggle to align itself with prevailing social thought, the following precepts appear to be true: 1. Institutional plausibility alignment is a product of human symbolism. As Berger and Luckmann suspected, language is the prmnary means by which the institution explains itself to a listening public. And even though scholars have been somewhat immobilized by the fear of anthropomorphism, or assigning human properties to an organization, we know that there is a collective or corporate rhetoric which represents the group to its public (McMillan, 1987). From this study, we have learned first hand that when the institution speaks, there are people behind those symbols - people who have been legitimize somehow to speak for the group (Parsons, 1960), and they have opted to create a configuration of human symbols capable of altering beliefs and attitudes about a contemporary problem. 2. Institutional plausibility alignment is representative. Apparently, the process of plausibility alignment is initiated by a minority of the membership who are serving boundary scanning functions for the group. These few (represented in this study by the Council on Theology and Culture) may even lead the membership through some of the aligning process. Ultimately, however, plausibility alignment must seek the endorsement of the total membership (i.e., the LAG document had to be approved by the highest representative body of the PCUS, the General Assembly). Even then, the messages which are chosen to represent the institution are not always those which we as individual members would choose, but by virtue of our affiliation with the group, we, too, must own them. The nature of collective rhetoric does not allow us to pick and choose only those messages which please us; we must also be responsible for those institutional symbols expended in our behalf. 3. Institutional plausibility alignment tends to be conservative. Though there are movers and shakers in the institutional world just as there are among individuals, the group engaged in plausibility alignment is usually not among them. First, by definition, plausibility alignment is reactive. Because the group engaged in alignment is responding to an updated interpretation of some issue (sexism, in the case of the PCUS), it is clear that they have been placed in that posture by some other societal actor or actors and, to some degree, are being forced to act. Secondly, plausibility alignment appears to be cautious. If there is any label that can be appropriately attached to the PCUS exercise, it is moderation. In attempting to adjust the attitudes of their constituency, both internal and external, their language was careful and guarded, their argument extended and elaborated, and their style moderate and conciliatory. Ultimately, too, the PCUS Council</page><page sequence="17">342 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION rejected Berger's original bi-polar extremes in favor of a middle-of-the-road posture. At least in the PCUS example, the stakes of plausibility alignment appear to be too high to risk valued members, potential recruits, or critical resources. Finally, it is a logistical given that the process of plausibility alignment must be slow. Small group theorists and practitioners have long debated the protracted nature of group, as opposed to individual, decision-making (Brilhart, 1986), even when group members have the advantage of interacting face-to-face. There are simply more facts and opinions to be voiced, more reservations to be expressed, and more general constraints with which to deal. When responsibility for collective decisions is widely dispersed among individuals who are physically separated (as was the case with the PCUS and with most other institutions), decision-making is even slower and more problematic. Thus, given the reactive, cautious, and protracted posture of the PCUS Council, it appears that institutions take wobbly baby steps when traversing the uncertain terrain of plausibility adjustment. 4. Institutional plausibility alignment is rhetorical As such, the symbols used to alter a collective belief are both public and persuasive. I have already demonstrated that for a message to represent a collectivity, it must be articulated and shared by the membership. No closed door decisions or back room caucuses for plausibility alignment. If a decision never makes the public arena in some form, then it never "counts as" a representative tenet of its sponsoring group. Plausibility alignment is also persuasive. Because the aligning message seeks to disentangle its receivers from one ideological position and to attach them to another, it must change minds, and hearts. And because of the dependent environment in which institutions reside, the scope of this persuasion is broad; it must include receivers both inside and outside system boundaries. In fact, there is no hearer that plausibility alignment can afford to alienate. The finding that institutions are inherently rhetorical should not surprise us when we remember that they are inhabited by people. There is no evidence whatsoever that the PCUS Council planned, calculated, or strategized about the writing of the "Language About God" treatise, and yet the document was shot through with an uncanny rhetorical savvy. Thus the PCUS Council taught us about institutions what we have known about individuals since Aristotle, and that is that they have a basic need to exert influence and that their cheapest, most abundant resource for the task is words. In short, I submit that institutional plausibility alignment is simply a product of the pooled rhetorical knowhow of human beings in behalf of the institutions which they represent. Perhaps the greatest value of studies such as these is to make explicit the rhetorical expertise which so many institutions implicitly employ every day that they live. REFERENCES Adams, J.
