<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW AGRARIAN UNREST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. By ERICH H. JACOBY. xvii and 287 pp.; maps, bibliogr., index. Columbia University Press, New York, 1949. $4.00. 91 x 6 inches. The rapid advance of the Chinese Communists in their southward drive into the provinces of Kwangtung and Fukien and other recent postwar developments have forced the West to become increasingly concerned with Southeast Asia. This region is striving to free itself from alien economic and political domination, and, in the political sphere at least, it has made remarkable headway. Western economic and political penetration has failed to further the material welfare of the rural masses and instead has caused a disintegration in rural com- munities, leading to serious difficulties and widespread discontent among the peasant peoples. Dr. Jacoby interprets "agrarian unrest" broadly and therefore includes in his survey Burma, Siam, Indochina, Malaya, Java, and the Philippines. The first and last chapters deal with themes common to all the countries of Southeast Asia, such as the effect of Western penetration on the economic and social structure of the village, the role of the Chinese and Indian moneylender and middleman, the growth of commercial agriculture, the deplorably low levels of living, health, and education, and the growth of national movements. The other six chapters are devoted each to one specific country and cover such topics as popula- tion, area under cultivation, size of farms, land tenure, rural indebtedness, levels of living, attempts of the government to improve conditions of the rural population, and, where they have occurred, peasant uprisings. The book does not offer anything new, since it is based largely on previously published material rather than on firsthand observations and investigations. The discussion of the rubber industry in Malaya did not benefit from the studies by P. T. Bauer; instead, the author repeats several one-sided and misleading arguments in favor of the plantation and against the peasant rubber grower. In general, however, Dr. Jacoby has rendered a service in bringing together within a single volume a large mass of data that will enable the reader to understand more fully current events in Southeast Asia. An extensive bibliography will aid those who wish to study the region further.-KARLJ. PELZER LOS DIBUJOS GIGANTESCOS EN EL SUELO DE LAS PAMPAS DE NAZCA Y PALPA. By MARIA REICHE. 30 pp.; maps, ills. Editora Medica Peruana, S.A. (Azangaro 906), Lima, Peru, n. d. S /o 8.oo. 64 x 92 inches. The region extending from a short distance north of Palpa, Department of Ica, Peru, to the valleys south of Nazca is especially rich in surface markings made by man in prehistoric times. This concentration is due to the nature of the soil and to surrounding elevations that afford protection against winds and drifting sand. The soil, in addition to being absolutely dry, has a peculiar color stratification. The surface layer is very dark, owing to the oxidation of iron, and beneath it is a nearly white or yellowish layer. This is the vast "blackboard" on which man once made the marks that are today suspected of being astronomical records. Stimulated by the work of Paul Kosak of Long Island University, Miss Reiche has been studying this group of markings in detail since I94I. Her work has been aided especially by the Escuela de Altos Estudios of the University of San Marcos, by the Servicio Geografico of the Army, and by the Servicio Aerofotografico. In the present publication she gives some I66</page><page sequence="2">GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEWS of her results and methods under the following headings: general description, location, form, visibility, size, the problem of reproduction, some detailed characteristics, the spirals, orienta- tion of the markings, and markings in danger of destruction. The photographs and maps show four types of markings: (I) virtually straight, long lines, radiating from centers or more or less parallel; (2) straight-sided trapezoidal or tri- angular figures, isolated or radiating from centers; (3) figures formed by curved lines, some- times resembling labyrinths; and (4) anthropomorphic figures, the details of which are best seen from the air. Size varies enormously, but size repetitions suggest that a measuring standard might have been in existence. The largest marking Miss Reiche reports has an aver- age breadth of 50 meters and extends for a distance of I700 meters. Such dimensions, together with air views showing high pattern density, make it obvious that much human labor was expended here. It has not been Miss Reiche's purpose in this publication to go into the details of astro- nomical observations. This she reserves for another time. However, she brings out such facts as the following: (I) many of the lines can be associated with notches in the mountainous horizon, an indication that they were constructed with a view to that direction; (2) lines trending in certain directions are commoner than others, and especially those with a margin of variation between N 68? I5' E and N 70? Io' E; (3) certain markings could have in- dicated the position of the rising or setting of certain stars in the constellation Ursa Major during the interval between 500 B.C. and A.D. I500; (4) there are lines approximating the meridian, which favor the astronomical hypothesis. Finally, Miss Reiche makes it clear that, with the Pan-American Highway passing through this region and obliterating parts of the markings, there is imminent danger that many will soon be lost entirely. This fact emphasizes the importance of her studies on these intriguing records of the past.-T. D. STEWART HISTORY OF THE WHITE PINE INDUSTRY IN MINNESOTA. By AGNES M. LARSON. xv and 432 pp.; map, ills., index. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, I949. $7.50. 94 x 6 inches. In this study of the white-pine industry of Minnesota, Professor Larson, chairman of the Department of History at St. Olaf College, has made an excellent contribution to the regional history and historical geography of the Upper Great Lakes area and the upper Mississippi Valley. Minnesota's pineries were the last of the great northern pine forests to be depleted. The advent of the white-pine industry in the St. Croix Valley in the i840's and i850's corre- sponded with its demise at the eastern end of the northern forest in Maine. Men from this state were important in the upper Mississippi region, both as sawmill owners and as lumber- jacks. The first lumber camps were even called State-of-Maine camps. Tea was the drink of the lumberjacks. Not until other eastern Americans and Scandinavians began to enter the woods in the seventies and eighties did the lumber camps as we knew them at the start of this century develop; the importance of coffee in the lumber camp, the "Paul Bunyan" stories, the ice road for transport of logs, and many other regional characteristics postdate the "Maine era." The author never loses sight of the importance of the market in the development and continuance of the lumber industry. Consequently, she ably presents the downriver rafting I67</page></plain_text>
