<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 120 How then, given the shifting tide in modern research, should these recent findings be interpreted? One might suggest they be viewed as interesting, provocative, even (or es- pecially) exciting, simply not un- equivocal. In addition to LeVay's anatomical findings, Dean Hamer has reported a likely locus on the X chromosome for a gay gene in men. Such a view is copacetic with LeVay's observations because devel- opment must have a genetic sub- strate. Hamer used reconstructed family pedigrees to examine a mode of inheritance for homosexuality and found that it appeared as if gay men inherited a trait from their mothers, but not from their fathers. This brought into discussion that a gene may be located on the X chromo- some, which a son must always re- ceive from his mother. Hamer then applied molecular genetic tech- niques, using linkage markers, that allowed his group specifically to focus on whether a small region of the X chromosome was the same or different in different individuals. Using families with two gay broth- ers, his group found that a small region near the end of the chromo- some, called Xq28, was essentially the same in gay brothers but differ- ent in their heterosexual brothers. Statistically, such observations could arise by chance only once in 100,000 times. The chromosomal segment Xq28, which contains hundreds of individual genes, may be said to be correlated with homosexuality; the individual gene has yet to be discov- ered. But one could guess that the protein produced by this putative gene could play some physiological role in the development of the sexu- ally dimorphic development of the hypothalamus. Or not. It is still per- haps too simple a solution to suggest that one gene may connect the known truthful facets of the genet- ics, neurobiology, and psychology of homosexuality. The imaginative leap that one gene could explain so much is simply so seductive that we must be careful not to lose scientific objec- tivity in the process of subjective speculation. Both empirical fact and creative fiction play important roles in sci- ence, and it is simply this separat- ing the dancer from the dance, the scientist from the science that has been the challenge in interpreting the last 100 years of this history. Fortunately, science is self-correct- ing, and the erroneous conclusions based on preconceived notions will eventually be weeded out by their lack of reproducibility, but this process will be painfully slow. The accumulation of recent experimental evidence obtained with modern tech- niques in a more tolerant atmos- phere may finally bring us an answer about the biological basis of homosexuality. But the answers to questions such as Why are we as a society so emotionally invested in this research? Why is it held so closely as a moral litmus test for our society? and Why does this question remain with us with such subter- ranean persistence? may lie in the historical impact homosexuality has held outside of science, such as the dictates set on society's view by reli- gion. The legal impact of a biological basis to homosexuality is discussed at chapter length, but LeVay seems reticent on religion. Although LeVay reports studies on women whenever possible, the imbalance of the narra- tive toward gay men instead of les- bians is at once unavoidable, as a result of the medical and scientific sexism of the day, and regrettable. When LeVay began his anatomical studies, the cadavers of gay men who died of AIDS-related illnesses were all too easily attainable, whereas those of lesbians were not. Dean Hamer has spent considerable effort searching for a genetic corre- late to lesbianism, but if the putative gene located in Xq28 had been lo- cated on any other chromosome, he'd likely still be dataless. Thus, for cir- cumstances alone, recent work again centers on gay men. Even if one might have hoped for more discus- sion of religion or accounts on the scientiElc studies of lesbianism, Queer Science is a wonderful book, lucidly written and educational. A New Perspective on the Old Battle of the Sexes Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex. By Robin Baker. NewYork: Basic Books, 1996, 319 pages. Cloth, $25.00. Reviewed by Michael W. Wiederman, Ph.D., Ball State University, De- partment of Psychological Science, Muncie, IN 47306. What would you say if I told you that women influence their fertility through masturbation? That men adjust the number of sperm in each ejaculate according to the relative like- lihood that their female partner may have been unfaithful recently? That women are most likely to have sex with an extradyadic partner near the peak of their monthly fertility and are most likely to have sex with their regular sex partner during the infertile phase? Or that the timing of a woman's orgasm within a given sexual episode of coitus influences whether she will become pregnant from that act of intercourse? These are a just a few of the basic biological phenomena upon which the extremely fascinating and revolutionary book, Sperm Wars, is based. Many readers of JSR may be un- familiar with the author, Robin Baker, a biologist working in England, whose primary publication outlet for the unique work conducted with col- league Mark Bellis has been the journal, Animal Behavior (Baker &amp; Bellis, 1993a, b; Bellis &amp; Baker, 1990). These earlier empirical articles were based on questionnaire data as well as analyses of hundreds of human ejaculates collected during mastur- bation and coitus, including many samples of the "flowback" from wo- men's vaginas. Sperm Wars is also based on more recent work in which Baker and Bellis documented what occurs inside the woman's body at the moments of ejaculation and</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 121 female orgasm using a fiber-optic en- doscope attached to the underside of a man's penis. As Baker commented, those images "completely changed my scientific understanding of what happens at the most critical moments during sex" (p. xvii). Sperm Wars has that effect on its readers as well. The descriptions of what occurs biologically during sexual activity di- rectly challenge many notions we were taught, and may continue to teach to our students, regarding male and female bodily response during and after sexual activity. Even such sacred notions as sperm existing with the "goal" of seeking and fertilizing the prized egg are turned on their head. Baker describes at least three types of distinctly different sperm, each with an apparently different mission. The "egg-getters," those who match our usual characterization of the typical sperm, in actuality com- prise only lSo or less of the sperm in a man's ejaculate. Other sperm ap- pear to function as "blockers" of women's cervical crypts or "egg- killers" who attack foreign sperm. Baker also discusses the discovery of specialized sperm that may kill a man's own egg-getters under certain prescribed circumstances. Lest you think that all of this talk of biology results in a "dry" reading experience, realize that Sperm Wars was written for public consumption, and as such does not contain one formal reference, no mention of other researchers, and no subject index. Instead, the author has taken his insights into the biol- ogy of sexual behavior, mixed in a fair amount of speculation, and pre- sents the results through 37 narra- tive "scenes." Baker notes that he did not intend for the scenes through which various phenomena are characterized to be pornographic or inherently arousing, yet many of them are very explicit and detailed depictions of both typi- cal and atypical sexual behavior. Im- mediately following each scene, Baker describes what occurred from the per- spective of an evolutionary biologist. That is, from an evolutionary and bi- ological view, why did each actor in the scene behave the way he or she did? Why did each actor's body re- spond the way it did? And what are the reproductive and interpersonal implications of each? Although the underpinnings of the book include evolutionary theory and natural se- lection, the reader is not sedated with a lengthy treatise of either. The insights, observations, and speculations are too numerous to cat- alogue here, but I will present a cou- ple of them, especially those having to do with sexual phenomena that have been problematic for previous authors to explain from a functional or an evolutionary perspective. The nature of the "sperm wars" around which the book is based have to do with both competition among two or more men's sperm within the same woman, as well as a sort of evolution- ary "war" that may occur between the male and female within a given sexual dyad. That is, in the latter type of sperm war, a woman's body may be "tryin' to avoid conception from a particular insemination, whereas a man's body might be "trying" to achieve fertilization of her egg (in an evolutionary sense of reproductive fitness). Both types of"wars" are high- lighted throughout the book, particu- larly as various sexual behaviors and experiences fit with the goals and outcomes of each type of battle. For example, why do so many hu- mans find oral sex arousing and a desirable activity? Of course, the sim- ple answer is "it feels good." But be- yond the sheer physical stimulation it provides, why is it arousing? Why is oral sex more desirable to many than manual manipulation of the genitals? Baker posits that, in an ul- timate sense, providing oral sex of- fers a unique opportunity to gather (perhaps subconsciously) information about a partner's reproductive health and (possible) recent infidelity. The first type of sperm war mentioned previously had to do with sperm com- petition among men. Baker admits this sperm competition is relatively rare (he estimates that approximately 20% of conceptions involve such sperm competition), yet the reproductive im- plications are strong enough to have shaped dramatically men's and wo- men's sexuality, both biological and psychological. Offering a mate the opportunity to perform oral sex at least communicates recent fidelity (or at least nothing to hide in that regard). That is, performing oral sex offers the possibility to detect, through vi- sual, olfactory, and gustatory cues, secretions left behind by a recent in- terloper (especially relevant data during our evolutionary history in which douches and baths were nonex- istent or infrequent). These hypothe- ses fit well with another recent book that included consideration of the ul- timate functions of oral sex (Kohl &amp; Francoeur, 1995). Baker explains how oral sex, both giving and receiving, evolved to become more or less in- herently pleasurable because of the ultimate functions it may have served. Other writers have attempted to explain the function and evolution- ary value of female orgasm, and typ- ically concluded that female orgasm is an unintended evolutionary byprod- uct or evolved to strengthen pairbonds (e.g., Fisher, 1992; Symons, 1979). Armed with more recent and relevant data, Baker describes how women's orgasms, although certainly not re- quired for fertilization, can profoundly affect likelihood of conception. After describing at length the vaginal and cervical environments, Baker intro- duces the concept of a "cervical filter," referring to the type and amount of cervical mucus, cellular debris, ejected sperm, and other organic material. The strength of a woman's cervical filter fluctuates depending on vari- ous conditions, one of which is length of time since last orgasm. Orgasm (from masturbation, for example) re- sults in a stronger cervical filter if performed 24 hours after intercourse than orgasm experienced 48 hours after intercourse. The strength of the cervical filter affects the relative ease with which sperm can reach the fal- lopian tubes, where fertilization typically takes place.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 122 dividual engaging in the behavior. Also, even though Baker explained that it was not his intention nor be- lief that Sperm Wars contains sexist views (p. xxiv), some very controver- sial ideas are sure to offend some and anger others. One primary exam- ple involves Baker's position on sex- ual aggression within relationships, from "rough-and-tumble sex play" to forced intercourse. Baker makes few distinctions between these two types of aggression and attributes both to female testing of male partners' strength and ability to overcome her resistance. "To test this [ability], she has to resist first verbally, then phys- ically. The stronger and more realis- tic her resistance, the better the test" (p. 223). Baker notes that "[i]n species such as humans that form long-term relationships, rough-and- tumble sexual behavior is most im- portant during early stages of courtship. Once a woman has tested a man's ability to force himself on her, she need not do it often thereafter" (pp. 223-224). I do not even have to elaborate on the ideological problem many readers would have with this perspective. Empirically, data are needed to support such an interpre- tation of the reproductive "function" of sexual aggression (playful or other- wise) within couples. Despite a lack of psychological un- derpinning and some politically in- correct views, Sperm Wars truly is a revolutionary look at human sexual behavior. Rather than attempting to explain only certain aspects of sex- ual behavior, or isolated sexual phe- nomena, Baker bites off large pieces in his attempt to explain human sex- uality. From routine sexual function- ing, to extradyadic sex, to fantasies and erotica, to masturbation and wet dreams, Baker weaves empirical find- ings, evolutionary theory, specula- tion, and narrative illustration into a very readable account. The acade- mic who reads Sperm Wars will not likely swallow everything whole, but I can guarantee that the experience will forever alter how the reader views human sexual behavior. The story does not stop there. Through experiments conducted in his lab, Baker found that timing of female orgasm during or around the occurrence of vaginal intercourse fur- ther affects the likelihood of fertil- ization. During female orgasm the woman's cervix dips and the opening to the cervix gapes open, much like an elephant's trunk while taking in water. If a seminal pool is present in the vagina at that point, a significant number of sperm will be helped along by this "up-suck" phenomenon. So, to maximize conception, a woman should experience an orgasm immediately after a man ejaculates. If the woman experiences orgasm when a seminal pool is not present, vaginal secretions are likely to be "sucked up," thereby increasing the acidity of the cervical environment. Accordingly, female or- gasm prior to male ejaculation strengthens the cervical filter and re- duces the likelihood of fertilization. In this context, Baker also discusses the role of nocturnal orgasms in women's sexuality. I was fascinated by this and other material in Sperm Wars, yet as I try to convey some of it here I am struck by how sterile the bare information seems. One strength of the book is Baker's ability to weave didactic cov- erage of material with his narrative scenes in which realistic sexual sce- narios are used to provide a context for what the biological phenomena "look like," or actually how they play out, in real life. Accordingly, I encour- age the reader of this review not to judge the book by my meager descrip- tion. Despite the praise I lavish on Baker and Sperm Wars, the book is not with- out its flaws and shortcomings. On a very minor note, there are several places where the reader encounters a British use of a word or phrase that an American is not likely to un- derstand fully. On a conceptual level, those involved in the social sciences may feel as though something is miss- ing. Baker's background is biology, so it should not be surprising that the book is weaker in providing psycho- logical links between biological func- tion and overt behavior. As just one ex- ample, Baker describes how men adjust the number of sperm in their ejaculate according to the proportion of time since last intercourse during which the man's partner was out of his sight (and hence potentially avail- able for rival insemination). What is missing is an attempted answer to the fascinating questions of what psy- chological mechanisms are involved in performing such a "calculation" and what other relationship characteris- tics might affect the adjustment of sperm in ejaculate. Ultimately, in discussing most phenomena, Baker relies on a sort of anthropomorphic presentation of men's and women's bodies. That is, he translates an ultimate reproduc- tive advantage associated with cer- tain sexual behaviors into a kind of hidden agenda on the part of men's and women's bodies. At times, human bodies are presented as sort of hav- ing minds of their own, which fre- quently result in a "conflict between the conscious brain and the subcon- scious body" (p. 109). Baker starts with the assumption that "whenever the body is intent upon a particular course of action, it generates an urge to perform that action" (pp. 166-167) and concludes that most of the strategies shown by men and women in relation to ejaculation and orgasm are sub- conscious orchestrated by the body via sequences of mood, libido, and sensitivity to stimulation. In- deed, most of the behavior de- scribed in this book is similarly subconsciousX the product of ge- netic programming rather than cerebral rationalization. (p. 199) Social scientists more concerned with conscious processes and social forces may be somewhat uncomfortable with these basic assumptions upon which Sperm Wars is based. In a gen- eral sense, there is a problem of tele- ology as Baker frequently seems to jump from the existence of a sexual behavior to its ultimate reproductive function (consequence) to an inher- ent motivation on the part of the in-</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 123 References Baker, R.
