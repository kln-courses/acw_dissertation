W Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute 1000 Route 202, Raritan, NewJersey 08869 USA ABSTRACT A cell's decision whether to undergo apoptosis (cell suicide) is examined herefrom an adapta- tionist perspective, rather than a mechanistic one. External and internal inputs to the cell's protein-based information processing network are used in making this decision, with the cell factoring in its replaceability. A system in which each cell takes primary responsibility for deciding its own fate has great adaptive value because it harnesses each cell's self-knowledge rather than waitingfor external cues to be recognized by other cells. Cell self-destruction can be an important selective mechanism, potentially leading to better performance of tissues over time. However, reli- ance on cells to monitor themselves has aflaw, since cells may incur selfish mutations that impair their apoptotic responsibility. The tight control exerted over somatic cells serves to check selfish genes involved in neoplasia and viral infections. Germ cells appear to be similarly monitored, both by other germ cells and by supportingfollicular or Sertoli cells, thus maintaining the advan- tages offered by an apoptotic system. The adaptationist approach views the limited replacement of neurons and cardiac myocytes as likely to have net survival value. The linkage of these cells into a network with their neighbors throughout a lifetime allows for a precisely functioning team of cells expected to compensateforgradual declines in individual cellfunctionality. Replacement of apoptotic cells with naive cells might decrease brain functionality and might risk upsetting the conduction of cardiac impulses. The evolutionary viewpoint lends itself to new hypotheses, but only the boldestspeculatorwould havepredicted a system in which cells aregiven primary responsi- bility for deciding whether to kill themselves when they deem it beneficial to the organism. INTRODUCTION A POPTOSIS is the orderly process of cell death that requires the functional cellu- lar machinery of gene expression and protein synthesis (Kerr et al. 1972; Wyllie 1987; Smith et al. 1994). Frequently referred to as pro- grammed cell death, apoptosis is typically con- trasted with necrosis. The term "oncosis" is be- ing proposed for the process leading to cell death when the cell is not a willing participant in its own death (Majno andJoris 1995; Trump 1995). The apoptotic decision is defined here as the cell's decision to kill itself or continue living (Steller 1995; Thompson 1995).

Apoptosis occurs in settings where cells are no longer needed, such as during tissue devel- opment, in healing tissues, among oocytes and their follicular cells, and in tissues undergoing atrophy because of reduced functional re- quirements. Apoptosis is also prominent in cases where cells may be directly harmful, such as lymphocytes targeted at self antigens, resid- ual neutrophils at resolving inflammatory sites, virally infected cells, and damaged cells that might become neoplastic. Because apo- ptosis does not involve leakage of cell contents before the dying cell is phagocytized by neigh- boring cells or macrophages, the process is a "clean" way of disposing of a cell, one that does not lead to inflammation or spillage of virions (Clouston and Kerr 1985). Apoptosis also oc- curs in situations where cells are exposed to potentially lethal insults of any kind (Raff et al. 1993; Thompson 1995). Severely damaged cells are directly killed via oncosis or necrosis, while less damaged cells may undergo apopto- sis. In this situation, apoptosis would tend to prevent neoplasia by removing mutated cells, and would allow the tissue to be repopulated with the progeny of less damaged (or more resistant) cells. The purpose of this review is to consider (1) a cell's apoptotic decision, (2) apoptosis as a system, and (3) the lack of replaceability of lost cells in certain tissues, using an adaptationist (evolutionary) approach rather than a mecha- nistic one. The adaptationist approach hypothe- sizes how a system could or should function, and fills in the details later. The mechanistic approach, on the other hand, builds upon the discovery of details that explain how a system actually functions, and only later hypothesizes about the possible adaptive value of those de- tails. Implicit in the adaptationist approach is the consideration of alternatives to existing systems; utility of this perspective has been particularly well described by Nesse and Wil- liams (1994) and Dennett (1995). It is often not sufficient to ask why a feature exists in its present form; understanding it may require seeking other perspectives. The perspective employed here, in combination with the adap- tationist approach, builds on the view that cells have robust information processing mechanisms not unlike those of a complex multicellular nervous system. The apoptotic decision will be considered in this review to be a true decision on the part of each cell, based upon inputs to the cell's information processing network. This con- cept-that information is considered by the cell in making its decision-is derived from several sources: (1) Koshland (1977) noted that the processes driving behavior of individ- ual cells are analogous to those of animals and humans (e.g.,judgment, memory, choice, and discrimination), (2) Braitenberg (1984) de- scribed how imaginary artificial beings with in- creasingly complex behavior and psychologi- cal attributes could be synthesized through a series of rather simple steps involving informa- tion processing networks, and (3) Bray (1990, 1995) noted the similarity of protein-based cellular information processing to neural net- works. This psychological view of cell information gathering, information processing, and re- sponse requires an awareness of the abun- dance of inputs available to cells. Beyond the specific ligands recognized through cell sur- face receptors and signal transduction pro- teins, any perturbation of a cell (chemical or physical) can potentially be detected. Dennett (1971) noted that the best way to predict the next move of a chess-playing computer is to assume that the computer intends to win, rather than by analysing its circuitry; similarly, consideration of a cell's intentionality also of- fers a useful approach in an adaptationist anal- ysis. Although terminology is used that some may consider anthropomorphic, the intent is to compare the information processing of cells with those of animals (at whatever level of neural development the reader feels is ap- propriate), since the fundamental processes are similar. I will consider those areas of apo- ptosis (and cell replacement) where the com- bination of an adaptationist approach with the cellular information processing perspective leads to potentially useful insights. Some of the points discussed are not original, and oth- ers are of a speculative nature, derived from this analysis.</page><page sequence="3">JUNE 1997 AN ADAPTATIONIST VIEW OF APOPTOSIS 137 CELLS HAVE A SINGLE COMMON GOAL The reliance on apoptosis as a mechanism for removing unneeded or dangerous cells de- pends on the absence of genetic conflict among cells, since each cell's goal is to trans- mit its genetic information through time (Dawkins 1995). Under normal situations the cells in an organism are virtually genetically identical, although conflicts involving selfish genes can arise in neoplasia, in viral infec- tions, and among haploid gametes (Haig and Grafen 1991; Parker and Begon 1993). Al- though this review centers on multicellular an- imals, much of the discussion may be relevant to apoptosis in plants (Greenberg et al. 1994; Levine et al. 1994; Wang et al. 1996). With the recent descriptions of programmed cell death in unicellular organisms, the evolutionary ori- gins of apoptosis are pushed further back in time, and the degree of genetic relatedness of altruistic independent organisms thus be- comes critical (Ameisen 1996). In the following "team player analogy," an organism is compared to a team, and each cell is a player on that team, but there is no coach; the players work toward the success of the team, regardless of whether they actually play. On such a team, we might ask: How could a team player reach a decision to step out of the game in order to improve the team's success? The player would certainly consider the fol- lowing types of information: (1) external sig- nals concerning his performance (e.g., hear- ing or seeing reactions from teammates, or relative involvement in key plays), (2) knowl- edge of his internal state or health that is not directly apparent to others (e.g., not getting enough sleep-a temporary effect, or realiz- ing that his headaches keep getting worse-a progressive effect), and (3) knowledge of his replaceability (e.g., having highly specialized skills not readily replaceable, or having worked with other teammates so long and closely that they have learned to compensate for one another's weaknesses). These inputs would be used to make a comparison between the player and his teammates or his replace- ment, a replacement that might temporarily reduce the team's performance. The player's decision whether to play or quit would depend on the relative importance of each type of in- put. The strength and persistence of each type of input would change constantly. INPUTS TO THE APOPTOTIC DECISION External Inputs Raff (1992) has suggested that the default condition for a cell is apoptosis; only the con- tinued presence of survival factors from other cells (its social environment) keeps the cell from undergoing apoptosis. He described simple feedback mechanisms that might regu- late apoptosis, such as cells being forced to compete with neighboring cells for limited amounts of survival factors. While not denying the elegance of such a simple mechanism as the competition for survival factors, in the context of this discussion, the concentration of survival factors can be viewed as informa- tion (rather important information) to be used for cell decision making. The concept of a cell constantly deciding whether to undergo apoptosis seems reasonable to the extent that the team player is always deciding whether the team would be better off without him. Thus, the apoptotic decision defined here would be answered "no" continuously and "yes" only once. The emphasis on the cell's social situa- tion is appropriate, since intercellular com- munication, which informs a cell about its per- formance in relation to its neighbors, is critical for making the apoptotic decision. This intercellular communication can occur through extracellular chemical messages, gap junctions, or mechanical signals via the "ex- tended cytoskeleton" that physically links cells directly or indirectly by way of the extracellu- lar matrix (Ingber et al. 1994). Knowledge of whether neighboring cells had decided to un- dergo apoptosis or replication would be espe- cially valuable information. A cell recognizing that its neighbor had decided upon apoptosis would suddenly find itself relatively more im- portant. The asynchrony of apoptosis seen in vivo or in vitro studies, despite seemingly iden- tical cell populations that receive the same treatments, most likely reflects the subtle "psy- chological" differences among cells; these dif- ferences are magnified by the effect that apo- ptosis of neighboring cells has upon its own apoptotic decision. This difference in deci- sion making, which appears stochastic be- cause we are not privy to the cell's inputs and</page><page sequence="4">138 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 72 their relative weights, is at the heart of the question of differing behaviors by seemingly identical cells. Internal Inputs Internal as well as external inputs are clearly crucial in making the apoptotic decision (Isaacs 1993; Steller 1995; Thompson 1995). As noted in the team player analogy, a compar- ison with other cells requires knowledge of one's own internal state, which includes the cell's performance level and health status. The tremendous amount of potential information available to a cell about itself (e.g., the status of its DNA, membranes, cytoskeleton, organ- elles, temperature, ionic concentrations) can be monitored directly or indirectly through the effects of perturbations on other compo- nents of the cell's information processing net- work. Presumably, a damaged cell would as- sess certain factors, such as injury and rate of repair, when making its apoptotic decision. A cell knows its own internal state best, just like that of our team player. Similarly, its knowl- edge of another cell's internal state is limited to that cell's external manifestations. A Cell's Knowledge of Its Replaceability and the Apoptotic Decision A cell's knowledge about its role or function (e.g., cell type, state of differentiation, and re- placeability) within an organism is likely to be hardwired (instinctive). The knowledge of its replaceability is expected to be an important factor in its decision to undergo apoptosis. At one extreme is virtually complete replaceabil- ity of cells with a high normal turnover (e.g., epidermal and intestinal epithelium, red blood cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes) and their stem cells; other cells with particu- larly high apoptotic rates include embryonic neurons and ovarian germ cells. At the other extreme are cells with little replaceability, most notably neurons and cardiac myocytes, and these cells would be expected to weigh the apoptotic decision particularly carefully. EMBRYONIC NEURONAL APOPTOSIS Embryonic brain development is character- ized by a marked overproduction of neurons and prominent apoptosis of excess cells. The removal of poorly functioning or incorrectly connected neurons by apoptosis has been noted as the benefit of excess neuron forma- tion during development (Raff et al. 1993; Ameisen 1994). Brown et al. (1994) used a computer neural network model to expand on the value of neuronal overproduction and the role of apoptosis in brain development. They found that neuronal overproduction, with subsequent deletion of neurons (even randomly), allowed substantially greater learn- ing (problem solving ability) than that accom- plished by starting out with only the necessary number of neurons. They deleted one neu- rode (artificial neuron) at a time from the net- work, and the network quickly relearned the solution. By sequential deletion and relearn- ing, a network starting with 12 intermediate layer (or hidden) neurodes that gradually dropped down to 3 neurodes was considerably more likely to reach a correct solution to the problem than a network that started with 3 neurodes and kept them. They noted that, while random removal of neurodes with subse- quent retraining was three times more effec- tive in their model than starting with just 3 neurodes, selecting out neurodes based on their contribution to learning the solution was five times more effective than starting with 3 neurodes. Brown et al. (1994) addressed the question of how a neurode/neuron can know how much contribution it is making relative to other neurodes/neurons by its performance. They developed an algorithm whereby a neu- rode that had relatively little change in its out- put regardless of input was presumed to be contributing little to solving the problem. Thus, by using changes in firing pattern as a criterion, the neurodes were able to deter- mine their relative value. As fewer neurodes remained in the network, each contributed in- creasingly to the solution, thus automatically halting further neurode deletion. This com- puter model thus placed neuronal overpro- duction in a new light, in addition to showing the utility of apoptosis as a selective tool. APOPTOSIS IN OVARIAN GERM CELLS Apoptosis is an especially prominent fea- ture of mammalian ovarian germ cells (Cou- couvanis et al. 1993). Baker (1963) calculated that in the embryonic human ovary there are roughly 6.8 million germ cells, peaking at the</page><page sequence="5">JUNE 1997 AN ADAPTATIONIST VIEW OF APOPTOSIS 139 fifth month postconception. By birth there are only about 2 million germ cells, with further declines owing to apoptosis before and after puberty. Of the 6 to 7 million germ cells, 400 is the maximum number likely to be ovulated. Thus we see that a vast excess of germ cells is formed, and that the excess cells commit suicide. It would be astounding if these cells simply undergo strictly random apoptosis, since there would have been no apparent rea- son for such a large number to be formed. Given that cells can have some knowledge of their internal state and can use that informa- tion to make the apoptotic decision, then these otherwise genetically identical cells must be selecting among themselves which germ cells should survive. The precise criteria they are using to make the apoptotic decision re- mains to be determined, but one might specu- late that various tests of function are con- ducted (Cohen 1975; Coucouvanis et al. 1993). Another intriguing feature of early ovarian germ cells is that daughter cells are linked by cytoplasmic bridges large enough to allow pas- sage of organelles (Dym and Fawcett 1971; Zamboni 1972). Thus the oogonia (mitoti- cally active germ cells) and early oocytes (mi- totically inactive germ cells) are intercon- nected throughout the ovary in such away that lineage can theoretically be determined. At present, the function of these cytoplasmic bridges has not been established, but an adap- tive function is presumed, since the complete division seen in other cells would otherwise be expected. The cytoplasmic bridges close off as the oocytes become surrounded by devel- oping follicular cells, which then establish nu- merous gap junctions with each oocyte. The linkage of the germ cells through lineage could serve as a way to pass information on an apoptotic decision (or an inclination toward apoptosis) back to ancestral cells and forward to descendent cells. This information might convey a message that the lineage has a defect and apoptosis should be considered more strongly. It is noteworthy that groups of oo- gonia and early oocytes have been observed to degenerate together (Weir and Rowlands 1977). Not only would this additional input help a germ cell to flag potential defects that it might not have found, but more importantly this could serve as a means of controlling rogue germ cells deficient in their apoptotic propensity and responsibility. If germ cells, with an irresponsible disinclination to un- dergo apoptosis, were to be passed on to fu- ture generations, then the advantages of apo- ptosis (in both somatic and germ cells) would be lost. Thus it is no coincidence that germ cells capable of passing on an apoptotic defect are "escorted." Germ cells are first tightly linked to their mother and daughter cells via intercellular bridges, and later are dependent on the supporting follicular cells, which have the capability of ending the oocyte's life (by undergoing apoptosis themselves). APOPTOSIS AND CONTROL OF TESTICULAR GERM CELLS Selection of male germ cells is less depen- dent on apoptosis; instead it relies more pre- dominantly on competition among sperm in fertilizing the ovum. While a female benefits by ensuring that only the very best ova are ovu- lated (especially if the cost of resources per offspring is high), a male individual is re- quired to have large numbers of sperm in or- der to ensure fertilization. This is owing in part to the female reproductive tract's demands for large numbers of sperm (Cohen and Mc- Naughton 1974; Roldan et al. 1992). A possi- bly related reason for large numbers of sperm is to overcome sperm competition from other males (Parker et al. 1972; Parker and Begon 1993; Manning and Chamberlain 1994). Nev- ertheless, it may be in the interest of an indi- vidual male that a genetically defective sperm does not fertilize an ovum. Thus it is notable that there is substantial germ cell apoptosis within the testis (Roosen-Rung and Leik 1968; Dym and Fawcett 1971). As with germ cells in the ovary, those in the testis are also linked with their ancestors and descendants by cyto- plasmic bridges. Again, there is no currently accepted explanation for an adaptive advan- tage for this communication among germ cells. For spermatogonia and spermatocytes, which are genetically identical except for re- cent mutations, the explanation given above for ovarian germ cells (information transfer relating to the apoptotic decision) maybe ade- quate. However, the finding of Braun et al. (1989) that the linkage via cytoplasmic brid- ges of the genetically different haploid sper-</page><page sequence="6">140 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 72 matids makes them functionally diploid, sug- gests an even more important function for the cytoplasmic bridges between spermatids. Because the haploid spermatids and sperm typically share one-half of their genes, there is an opportunity for the establishment of selfish killer or resource extractor genes that favor the survival of sperm carrying the genes for the trait, much to the detriment of sperm that do not carry those genes (Parker and Begon 1993). This threat is especially great immedi- ately after meiosis, since each spermatid is only one-third genetically related to each of its three sibs derived from a spermatocyte (the two sets of genes are shared by the four sper- matids derived from a spermatocyte, so a sper- matid's three sibs share its corresponding set of genes and two copies of the other set of genes). The cytoplasmic bridges would be ex- pected to play an important role in discourag- ing potential strife among genetically differ- ent gametes, since by harming one's sib, the spermatid would be harming itself (Haig and Bergstrom 1995). This phenomenon of selfish genes in gametes, termed meiotic drive, has been particularly well described for Drosophila and in the t locus of mice (Crow 1991; Haig and Grafen 1991; Lyttle 1991; Hurst 1992). The inhibition of meiosis in female germ cells until ovulation and fertilization effectively precludes the potential for genetic conflict in the ovary among the nonidentical haploid germ cells that can occur in the testis. As with the follicular cells of the ovary, the Sertoli cells in the testis provide not only nourishment but also can provide "apoptotic input" to those germ cells deficient in this regard. APOPTOSIS IN TISSUES WITH MODERATE CELL TURNOVER Most cells have variable life spans and may undergo apoptosis when they are no longer needed, substantially damaged, or directly harmful. Prostatic epithelial cells are an exam- ple of cells with an intermediate life span, and have been well studied from an apoptotic point of view (Furuya et al. 1994; Isaacs 1993). Normally about 2% of rat prostatic epithelial cells undergo apoptosis per day, and it is sug- gested that the membrane damage from se- cretion plus exposure of the cells to proteases takes its toll. Prostatic epithelium is also exqui- sitely hormonally responsive; upon removal of androgen (as with castration), about 80% of the prostatic epithelial cells undergo apopto- sis within 7 to 10 days. The timing of apoptosis in one cell relative to another cell, and why some cells decide not to undergo apoptosis, is of particular interest in the context of this review. A mechanistic approach would suggest that the cells are com- peting for scarce survival factors. Yet the informational/psychological view presented here suggests that survival factors provide in- formation to the cells about their current value in relation to other cells. The abrupt re- moval of androgen by castration would affect a prostatic epithelial cell's assessment of its usefulness to the organism as a whole. A large number of internal and external factors could influence a cell's apoptotic decision; the infor- mation provided by low androgen levels would be expected to influence the timing and over- all apoptotic decision. We might expect the balance between apoptosis and cellular atro- phy, in organs undergoing seasonal or disuse atrophy, to be tipped relatively more toward apoptosis in flying animals, where weight is a critical impediment, than in land or water- based animals. Presumably any such apoptotic propensity would be programmed as an in- stinct into the cell's information processing network. APOPTOSIS AS A SELECTIVE PROCESS FOR IMPROVING TISSUE PERFORMANCE Unequal rates of apoptosis owing to varia- tions in cell functioning is a selective process. Well-functioning cells or particularly useful cells would be less apt to decide upon apopto- sis; thus they would survive longer and pre- sumably be progenitors of replacement cells. One can conjecture that a mechanism could exist whereby progenitor or stem cells could receive feedback on the performance of their progeny, and that this information could be used to further enhance tissue performance through differential rates of apoptosis and proliferation at the stem cell level. In tissues such as epidermis and intestinal epithelium, the lineage would be expected to be traceable via a variety of cell communication mecha- nisms (although not as readily as in germ cells with their large cytoplasmic bridges, as de-</page><page sequence="7">JUNE 1997 AN ADAPTATIONIST VIEW OF APOPTOSIS 141 scribed previously). Because of the selective power of apoptosis, we might expect that the functionality of cells in a tissue could improve with time. In this selection for improved per- formance, we have a genetic algorithm (re- peatedly testing, selecting, and regenerating), described by Bray (1995) as the basis for the information processing network within cells to improve from cell generation to genera- tion. Countering any selective improvement in function are age-related functional deterio- rations, such as accumulating mutations, free radical-induced damage (including mitochon- drial DNA mutations), and advanced glycosyl- ation endproducts (Lee and Cerami 1992; Wallace 1994). Indeed, an important role for apoptosis as an antiaging mechanism by main- taining tissue functioning has been postulated (Tomei et al. 1994). The well-described antiaging and antineo- plastic benefits of dietary restriction appear to be attributable to the relative enhancement of apoptosis (Muskhelishvili et al. 1995). Grasl- Kraupp et al. (1994) studied preneoplastic foci in rat livers, which have enhanced rates of proliferation and apoptosis. They noted that dietary restriction both reduced proliferation and preferentially increased apoptosis in the preneoplastic cells, compared with normal he- patocytes. Additionally, they found that the liv- ers of rats with dietary restriction had reduced numbers of preneoplastic foci and tumors compared to control rats. Similarly,James and Muskhelishvili (1994) found that dietary re- striction in mice increased the apoptotic rate in the liver (and reduced the proliferative rate), which was associated with a decreased incidence of liver tumors over a three-year pe- riod. Thus there is clear experimental evi- dence for the selective role of apoptosis in im- proving tissue functionality and inhibiting aging. Improved tissue functioning over time is notable in two tissues that use markedly differ- ent mechanisms: (1) individual cell learning (making adaptive changes as a result of experi- ence or instruction) -a specialty of neurons, and (2) differential cell selection through apoptosis coupled with proliferation-a spe- cialty of lymphocytes. The nervous system's functionality improves with time through the ability of individual neurons to learn (the learning of the overall task being dependent upon the learning of each neuron involved). At the other extreme, the improved perfor- mance of the immune system owing to selec- tive apoptosis of relatively unnecessary lym- phocytes and proliferation of important ones is a clear example of improved functioning with time. One would expect that in other cell types, learning by individual cells, along with apoptosis of cells relatively poor at learning, would be a powerful combination, but at pres- ent this possibility remains speculative. It is clearly important that the immune sys- tem in an individual be able to evolve to com- pete in the arms race with rapidly evolving po- tentially pathogenic microorganisms (Levin and Bull 1994). As mentioned, the apoptosis of underutilized lymphocytes makes this selec- tive process possible. Nevertheless, one could see where apoptotic selection, combined with individual cell learning (including selection for cell learning), could have considerable utility in host defense, if it were to occur. For instance, one function of Kupffer cells (the fixed macrophages in the liver derived from the bone marrow) is to protect the systemic circulation from bacterial invasion from the intestine. Kupffer cells are well endowed with receptors that recognize bacteria, in part ow- ing to receptors for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer cell wall of gram negative bacteria. Free LPS shed from dead or dividing bacteria, however, is not in itself a threat-it may simply be noise that should be ignored, or at other times it may indicate some degree of bacterial threat. Thus a Kupffer cell that could quickly learn effective strategies for interpreting po- tential bacterial signals and respond effec- tively (killing bacteria, while minimizing false alarms and damage to adjacent cells), would be especially valuable. [The prominent role of Kupffer cells in causing hepatic damage has been reviewed by Laskin (1994).] Selection through apoptosis of less adroit Kupffer cells could effectively raise the rate of learning. The diminished responsiveness (tolerance) that occurs following repeated experimental doses of LPS or tumor necrosis factor suggests indi- vidual cell learning by macrophages. Clearly, cells have the capability for both learning and self-destruction, and the rapid evolutionary capability of surrounding microorganisms</page><page sequence="8">142 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 72 during an individual's lifetime would be a strong selective force. At present, the en- hanced performance over time of defensive cells other than lymphocytes (e.g., epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages) is speculative. TISSUES LACKING REGENERATIVE CAPABILITY Two tissues notorious for lacking significant regenerative ability are neurons in the adult brain and myocytes in the heart; at present there is no accepted explanation for why this should be so for either organ (Compston 1994; Gulati 1995). The mechanistic response is that these tissues consist of postmitotic cells, although there appears to be slight prolifera- tive capacity for cardiac myocytes (Liu Yet al. 1995). The neurotrophic theory postulates that limitations on growth factors and neu- ronal responsiveness to them inhibit neuronal replication (Raff et al. 199a). These mechanis- tic explanations, however, still do not answer the question of why that should be. Given that most cell types have regenerative capability, and that cell capabilities continue to offer sur- prises, it is reasonable to assume that this lack of regenerative capacity has benefits that out- weigh the disadvantages. Indeed, Tomei et al. (1994) appear to be on track with their com- ment that "[i]n many cases, these cells have such intricate architectural features and con- tact points that their replication is of necessity constrained or totally precluded" (p 385). The combination of views presented here-that organisms have cells linked in networks and that cells can be viewed as fiercely loyal or al- truistic team members-suggests a speculative answer along the lines suggested by Tomei et al. (1994). Absence of Replacement Neurons Since neurons do not proliferate substan- tially in postnatal life, these cells have spent a lifetime together as part of a network; the neurons developed together and grow old to- gether. The results of this teamwork are clearly evident in the brain. Memories are made by the cooperative efforts of these neurons that have honed long-term relationships with spe- cific cells, even with cells in distant parts of the brain. A key feature of network learning using parallel distributed processing is that it is ro- bust. As seen with the computer model of neu- ronal apoptosis by Brown et al. (1994), neu- rodes in a network can compensate for the gradual loss of other neurodes. Within the brain, neurons gradually lose functionality as the insults of a lifetime accumulate. However, the cells in the network appear to compensate for this gradual change in inputs from aging neurons, since the overall output is little changed. Apoptosis of neurons may even oc- cur, although the criteria for deciding upon apoptosis clearly differ from those of readily replaceable cells. Should a defective or dead cell be replaced? The team player analogy is apt. Over a number of years, players on a team that demands high skill levels and close team- work would be able to recognize and adapt to the special strengths and weaknesses of each player. This adaptation would occur even as a player's ability weakens, eventually forcing him to quit. It is easily seen that an untrained replacement would not fit in with a team that has taken months or years to master the re- quired skills and cooperation needed to suc- ceed; a team would perform better without the new player. During the long period of train- ing, the replacementwould constantly be forc- ing the rest of the team to make radical adapta- tions. Isacson et al. (1995) reported that when pig neurons were transplanted into rat brains, the transplanted neurons were still making new connections for at least six months. The hypothesis presented here-that replacement of highly specialized cells by untrained, inex- perienced cells would be more disruptive than beneficial to neural network functioning lends itself to computer modeling. Absence of Replacement Heart Muscle Cells As with neurons, the myocardial cells have been associated with their neighbors for a lifetime, adapting to cell-to-cell variations in conduction ability and contraction strength. Unlike neuronal function, myocardial cell functions (transmitting electrical impulses and contracting) appear to be rather straight- forward. One would expect that a replace- ment cardiac myocyte should be able to be- come functional rather quickly. But because every heartbeat is critical (since arrhythmias can be fatal within minutes), there is little lee- way for experimentation or training. Perhaps</page><page sequence="9">JUNE 1997 AN ADAPTATIONIST VIEW OF APOPTOSIS 143 in the short period of time when a newly cre- ated replacement cell is establishing contacts (gap junctions) with its new neighbors, there might be enough disruption of electrical im- pulse conduction to start an arrhythmia. Cer- tainly, the chances of a single replacement cell setting off a fatal arrhythmia would be minus- cule, but the cumulative chances of a disrup- tive effect of multiple simultaneous replace- ment cells entering the myocardial network might tip the balance such that it is safer to not replace deteriorating or dead myocardial cells. Again, this speculation lends itself to computer modeling. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF APOPTOSIS Given that a cell knows more about itself than does any other cell, we see the great bene- fit of the system of apoptosis. Rather than en- trust the death decision solely to "enforcer" cells, the organism benefits from the more ac- curate assessment of cell status obtainable only by allowing each cell to take primary re- sponsibility to decide when, or if, it should die. Given this huge responsibility, it is obvious why there are so many pathways to apoptosis and why they should be looked upon as safe- guards rather than redundancies. APOPTOSIS AND NEOPLASIA The importance of apoptosis in preventing neoplasia is well described. In the simplest terms, when more cells proliferate than die, a tumor will result (Kerr et al. 1972; Isaacs 1993; Barrett and Preston 1994; Thompson 1995). In recent years, tumor suppressor genes and their protein products, many of which are in- volved in the induction of apoptosis, have been given equal status in their ability to pre- vent neoplasia as have the oncogenes (induc- ing cell proliferation) in their ability to cause neoplasia. The realization that an oncogene, c-myc, can also induce apoptosis points out the importance to the organism of keeping cell proliferation under tight control (by enhanc- ing the cell's sensitivity to apoptosis) (Evan et al. 1992). The majority of human neoplasms examined have been found to have a mutation affecting at least one of the genes involved in apoptosis, with over half having a defective p53 gene (Ashwell et al. 1994). Indeed, con- trol of potentially neoplastic cells has been suggested as the primary evolutionary func- tion of apoptosis (Umansky 1982). Where does apoptosis fit in with the other methods an organism has of preventing neo- plasia? Since under most circumstances neo- plasia is dependent upon successive muta- tions, the first defense against neoplasia is to monitor the DNA and repair any damage. The second line of defense would be for the cell to monitor its own behavior and health (check- ing on its ability to repair DNA damage), and to undergo apoptosis if: (1) it recognizes that its own behaviors (or even inclinations) are deviant, or (2) it appears that there may be significant irreparable DNA damage. It is noteworthy that free radicals are potent inducers of apoptosis (Buttke and Sandstrom 1994). This is an adaptive linkage, since a cell does not have to assess the health of each of its functions, but could simply note that a certain level of free radical exposure had occurred, and assume that a corresponding level of dam- age had occurred. Evidence that free radicals are used as signals by cells in making the apop- totic decision has been recently reviewed (Khan and Wilson 1995). The third line of defense is input from, or action by, other cells. This line of defense is employed for cells with abnormal or inappro- priate behavior that will not undergo apopto- sis on their own (based on inputs that would normally be expected to induce apoptosis). Here the "encouragement" of neighboring cells may be manifest through messages passed via gap junctions, considering that cell communication via gap junctions tends to be reduced when cells get proliferative signals from tumor promoters (Hotz-Wagenblatt and Shalloway 1993; Goldberg and Bertram 1994; Trosko and Goodman 1994). Failing this and other encouragement from neighboring cells to induce the "apoptotically impaired" cell to undergo apoptosis, cytotoxic lymphocytes may be called upon to offer more professional "assistance." Interestingly, even these profes- sional killer cells preferentially induce apo- ptosis over direct oncotic lysis (Raff et al. 1993; Berke 1995; Steller 1995). However, it has been noted that while the killed cells have the morphologic features of apoptosis, the death need not be voluntary (Trapani and Smyth 1993; Ameisen 1994). Thus the organism is protected from selfish DNA by cells first re-</page><page sequence="10">144 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 72 pairing themselves, then killing themselves, or finally being killed (Nesse and Williams 1994). In theoretical terms a perfectly functioning apoptotic system would prevent all neoplasia, since it would have a cell kill itself before the cell ever started proliferating out of control (just as a perfectly functioning DNA repair sys- tem could prevent all nonepigenetic neopla- sia, and likewise a perfectly functioning sur- veillance system could prevent all neoplasia). APOPTOSIS AND VIRUSES Similar mechanisms apply to viral infec- tions, which also involve selfish genes. Virally infected cells can recognize their altered in- ternal state and attempt to undergo apoptosis, but may be thwarted by antiapoptotic viral proteins (Clem and Miller 1994; Vaux et al. 1994; White and Gooding 1994). Apoptotic in- duction by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is then needed to control the infection. One can envi- sion a continuum of control of a virally in- fected cell's information processing network, from where the cell is in charge (and the virus is an annoyance), to where control is con- tested, to where the virus has usurped the cell's decision-making network. Correspond- ingly, the cell would be able to contribute less and less to its demise. Thus it is not surprising that cytotoxic lymphocytes have a variety of methods for inducing death in target cells (Liu C-C et al. 1995; Smyth and Trapani 1995). THE FLAW OF APOPTOSIS AS A SYSTEM OF CONTROL A major adaptive benefit of apoptosis as a system of control is that it harnesses each cell's self-knowledge rather than waiting for exter- nal cues to be recognized by other cells; the flaw of cells having the primary responsibility for recognizing their own relative value is that a cell can incur damage that impairs its apop- totic responsibility. A cell with a compromised apoptotic mechanism will gain a survival ad- vantage over the normal and responsible/al- truistic cells. Raff (1992) pointed out this price of apoptosis in the context of cells competing for limited survival factors: cells that compete best or require the fewest survival factors will be selected, with neoplasia the possible conse- quence. Viewed in another context, a mutated gene impairing apoptosis might be consid- ered to be a selfish gene, because it makes the cell less of a team player through its own en- hanced survival. Of course, in somatic cells this selfish gene would be limited to the life of the organism. Germ cells are closely linked to other germ cells and to specialized escort cells, which have the power to ensure that the bene- fits of apoptosis are not lost to future genera- tions. The flaw in apoptosis as a system of self- control might be termed the "kamikaze co- nundrum" -the problem of selecting for cells so loyal that they would willingly die for the cause, but in passing this destructive testing, they are no longer present to replicate. CONCLUSION The primary benefits of apoptosis are the removal of cells that are no longer needed or that are dangerous, and containment of po- tentially harmful cell contents. These func- tions could have been performed by profes- sional surveillance/scavenger cells or by neighboring cells. Instead, the responsibility for these functions rests with the individual cell, which makes the apoptotic decision based on a myriad of inputs into its informa- tion processing network. The major adaptive advantage of individual cell responsibility is that each cell is privy to considerably more in- formation about itself than are other cells. The cell's knowledge of its own relative impor- tance at any instant is heavily dependent on intercellular communication. The flaw in reli- ance on this cell altruism is that relatively irre- sponsible cells tend to flourish. Thus there are mechanisms whereby other cells can help con- trol both apoptotically irresponsible somatic cells (to prevent neoplasia) and germ cells (to prevent loss of the advantages of apoptosis in the offspring). The extent that apoptotic se- lection acts as a genetic algorithm enhancing tissue performance (and acting to counter the effects of aging) remains to be determined. While I have used an adaptationist viewpoint to generate these hypotheses, none of them even begin to approach the boldness needed to have predicted that cells are given the pri- mary responsibility for the decision to kill themselves when necessary.
