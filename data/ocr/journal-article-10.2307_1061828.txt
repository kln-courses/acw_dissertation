<plain_text><page sequence="1">David M. Knipe ONE FIRE, THREE FIRES, FIVE FIRES: VEDIC SYMBOLS IN TRANSITION In the famous "five-fire doctrine" of Chandogya-upanisad 5,1 Gautama, the conservatively learned father whose son, Svetaketu, the establishment graduate, has just been put down in the local assembly for his inability to answer five far-out questions, hears for the first time about the journey of the self (purusa) after death. He discovers that the cosmos is really five great sacrificial fires in which the gods make a series of offerings. The gods offer "faith" in the "heaven" fire in order to produce soma, then soma in the Parjanya fire to produce "rain," then rain in the "earth" fire to produce "food," then food in the "man" fire to produce "semen," and finally semen in the "woman" fire to complete the journey with a new embryo. This final ritual product, the garbha, will be born some ten months later and, Gautama is informed, will live until it makes its appointment with the (funeral) fire "from which he came."2 Now the curious thing about this teaching of the divine ritual production of a new being is the matter of five sacrificial fires. Why An earlier version of this article was presented as a paper to the Asian Religions' section of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in New York, October 23, 1970. 1 The following abbreviations will be employed for frequently cited Vedic texts: AiB., Aitareya-brahmana; AV., Atharvaveda-samhita; BAU., Brhadaranyaka- upanisad; ChU., Chandogya-upanisad; KB., Kausitaki-brahmana; KS., Kathaka-samhita; MS., Maitrayani-samhita; PB., Pancavimsa-brahmana; RV., R1gveda-samhita; ?B., Satapatha-brahmana; TB., Taittiriya-brFhmana; TS., Taittiriya-samphita; TU., Taittiriya-upanisad; and VS., Vajasaneyi-samhita. 2 ChU. 5.4-9. The five fires are loka, parjanya, prthivi, purusa, and yosd. The five offerings are sraddhd, soma, varsa, anna, and retas. 28</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions five, when the whole range of ancient Indian expressions demon- strates a predilection for triads modeled upon the triadic cosmos, when the Vedic doctrine of sacrifice seems largely to be dependent upon trivalent forms, and when the brahmanical system, ever preoccupied with the creation of new beings from old and the proper establishment of man in the universe, relies for its great srauta ritual schema upon three fires that are at once the projection of the sacrificer's single household fire, identical to his "self," and a replication of the triadic cosmos, identical to his "Self-to-be" ? In fact, if we turn to the very next lesson of the Chandogya text, we find the same Gautama, now transfigured to an articulate and esoterically knowledgeable father-guru, categorically declaring to 8vetaketu an orthodox triad of elements as the essential basis of all beings. Everything, insists ChU. 6.1-5, is of a threefold form (rupa), although one in origin. Does this suggest that the "five-fire doctrine" in ChU. 5 is a unique statement, an innovation in upanisadic numerical symbol- ism? On the contrary, pentadic expressions and systems are present in most Vedic and upanisadic texts, if not equitably distributed among them. The Taittiriya-upanisad, for example, propounds a different five-staged journey of the self after death. On leaving this world, the selves (dtman-)3 consisting of food, breath, thought, knowledge, and bliss are attained in succession.4 Elsewhere (TU. 1.7), there is collected an aphoristic list of three pentadic series each to explain the fivefold (pankta) nature of material objects (adhibhitam) and of the self (dtman). First among the latter's three series is the well-known list of five vital breaths. In another important upanisad, BAU. 1.4.17 declares "this sacrifice is fivefold [pdnkta], the sacrificial animal is fivefold, a person [purusa] is fivefold, all this world, whatever there is, is fivefold. He who knows this, attains this."5 And Aitareya- upanisad 3.3 defines the dtman not only as Brahma, Prajapati, Indra, and all the gods, but also as the five great elements- earth, air, space (dkdsa), water, and light.6 3 For the benefit of the general reader, plural inflections in one-word citations such as this are replaced by a hyphen. 4 TU. 2.8, a prefiguration of the influential "five sheaths" (panca-kosa-) doctrine of the Paingala-upanisad, Vedanta-sutras, etc. The series here is anna-, prdna-, mano-, vijnina-, and ananda-maya. 5 sa esa pdhkto yajiah pdnktah pasuh pdnktah purusah pdhktam idam sarvamr yad idam kim ca / tad idam sarvam dpnoti ya evam veda. 6... panca mahdbhutdni prthivi vdyur dkdaa dpo jyot.msity ...

Although each brahmana reveals such expressions, it is above all the Satapatha-brahmana, one-third of which is devoted to the agnicayana (the ritual construction of and speculation upon the five-layered fire altar), that is preoccupied with pentavalent symbolisms. To this brahmana and its rites we shall return. Nor is there a lack of pentads in the samhitas. Cosmogony, according to TS. 4.3.11.57 (and MS. 2.13.10; KS. 39.10), was a fivefold process. The sacrificer's part in the new-and-full-moon rites (TS. 1.6.1.2; MS. 1.4.4; KS. 5.6) begins by establishing ghee as the cosmic ground for the five winds, five seasons, five quarters, five peoples, etc. Elsewhere, in the rites for renewing the sacred fires, the sacrificer represents himself in five grain-cake offerings on five potsherds, the sacrifice (yajna) itself being declared fivefold (TS. 1.5.1-2; MS. 1.7.2-5; KS. 8.15; cf. Kapisthala 8.3-5), and on the grandest of srauta scales, in the Taittiriya-samhita version as in the Satapatha-brahmana, the agnicayana demonstrates the five- layered macro-microcosmic correspondence. The Atharvaveda also reveals a share of pentadic rites and speculations, as in the combinations of five grain-cake offerings (on limbs and navel) of the sacrificial goat (9.5) or white-footed sheep (3.29), or in specu- lations upon such divinities as the androgynous primordial being, Viraj (8.10). The Rgveda itself is more reluctant than the ritual texts to reveal pentadic expressions, and those that occur, such as allusions to the fivefold sacrifice (yajnam . .. pacaydmam) in 10.52.4 and 10.124.1, are characteristically susceptible to more than one interpretation, lacking as they do the liturgical context and self- analysis of many later texts. A mystical series of five (pahkti) seems also to be indicated by 10.117.8. In 9.86.29 the five directions (pradis-) are mentioned, and again obliquely in 2.13.10. The five directions may be implied in the obscure verse 1.164.12. On the other hand, some twenty-five references to the "five peoples" (or 7 pancabhir dhdtd vi dadhdv idam yat. 30</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions tribes, races, nations?) occur throughout the ten mandalas. Some appear to indicate a mythical or historical set of five Aryan tribes (Yadus, Turvasas, Druhyus, Anus, P&amp;rus), while other references may be to mankind in general, located at the "five directions" (cf. AV. 3.24.3).8 Thus, we see that the Chandogya five-fire doctrine, however innovative for upanisadic prefigurations of samsdra, is by no means a unique departure from orthodox tripartite man-fire- sacrifice-cosmos homologies, for it is precisely upon such a fivefold structure (pentavalent man, fire, sacrifice, cosmos) that the above mystico-liturgical passages appear to center, from the samhitas to the upanisads. This is important not only for our understanding of Vedic rites and speculations, but also for making sense of the significant legacy of pentadic symbols and expressions in early Hinduism, in Buddhism, Jainism, Samkhya-Yoga, etc.9 Such later 8 See A. A. Macdonell and A. B. Keith, Vedic Index of Names and Subjects (London: J. Murray, 1912), vol. 1, s.v. "paica-jandh," for various opinions and the citations for the term and its counterparts, panca krstaya4, panca ksitayah, panca carsanyah, and paica mdnusah. 9 Important series or groups of fives (paicavarga- or pancaka-) are everywhere, but there is not space to discuss them here. Even the sacred texts themselves may be constructed pentadically, as in the case of the puranas with their traditional five topics. See also the pafcasastras of the Vaisnavas, and especially the Pfai- caratra sect. Ritually speaking, there come first to mind the classical five daily sacrifices (paica-yajna- or mahdyajna-) of orthoprax Hinduism. One of the five, devayajna (devapfjd), has regional variants, such as pancayatanapujd, that demonstrate the tenacity of the fivefold structure of man and sacrifice, although p?ij has long since replaced yajna. Basic paicdyatana to the five deities (Visnu Siva, Brahma, or their counterparts, etc.) may be celebrated with the use of five stones, five colors, five combinations of the deities in each of the five directions, etc. Then, too, there are the five ritual products of the cow (paica-gavya), the five foods of immortality (paincmrta), the ritual use of the five jewels (panca-ratna) or five sacred leaves (paica-pallava), and occasionally the five-stranded bramanical thread (panca-vata) in place of the usual three-stranded one. Man's final sacrifice (antyesti) or funeral, as well as the later srdddha-, involves symbols of five and reveals the fact that "death" itself is a literal return to "fiveness," that is, a resump- tion of the preexistent fivefold space-time. The marriage samskdra also has a share of pentadic symbols, some regional variants including the ascension of a five- stepped platform. In Samkhya-Yoga and in the ascetic traditions, the five breaths have ritual significance as do the five heating fires (paica-tapas) of the ascetic. There are also the famous five "M's" of tantric ritual (paicamakdra). The medi- tational division of the syllable om into a, u, and n, plus the pair ndda and bindu, creates a familiar mystical series. Pentads also occur in Sikh rites, and technically the khdlsa is said to exist "where five are gathered," a conception found elsewhere as well. In the context of myth and iconography, there are the five faces (pancd- nana) of Siva and Brahma in a type of orientation pancavarga with the fifth face toward the zenith, the five eyes (panca-caksus) of the Buddha, who is also frequently depicted with five rays of light emanating from his head, and the five Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata as an expressive pancavarga. Most important in sectarian Hinduism are the explanations for the five-staged manifestations of supreme being (e.g., the vyiha doctrine of the Paficaratras) or the five actions (pancakrtya) by which the sacred projects itself. Architecturally, there are pancayatana temples with four shrines surrounding a fifth central one. The divine 31</page><page sequence="5">One Fire, Three Fires, Five Fires pancavarga- are, of course, no more remarkable in themselves than the triads, tetrads, or heptads so frequently encountered in the same schools or sects and their literatures. What should be note- worthy, however, are the principles that operate in the growth and formation of these symbols and the religious statements and notions they seek to convey. It is imperative for historians of religion to review the Vedic substrata and perceive essential religious structures and meanings, especially since large and fertile areas of the Vedic corpus have lain fallow, neglected by herme- neutics, after a rough century's harvesting with the implements of the textual critics. THE IMAGERY OF "X PLUS ONE" It is remarkable, considering our foregoing review, that the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics article on number symbolism by Keith,10 who, along with his contemporary Caland, displayed and/or brahmanical partition of the sacrificial body (animal, human, divine) into five, as we have seen, is part of the background of upanisadic elaborations, and these are continued with fivefold divisions of the subtle as well as the gross elements, the organs of action and of sense (pancendriya), the declaration of the five colors (panca-varna) corresponding to the five gross elements, and so forth. The five subtle elements (tanmdtra-) of the Sam.khyan tradition (sabda, spar4a, rupa, rasa, and gandha) produce the five gross elements (mahdbhfta-; see n. 6 above), while some Vedanta traditions explained the suksma-sarira as a threefold set of pentads (jidna-, karma-, and prdna-) distinct from the sthula-sarira's single series of five bhita-. Although the Buddhists did not include dkdsa among the mahdbhata-, allowing but four, the five aggregates (skandha-) that make up what the non-Buddhist calls the individual became a point of departure for every school of metaphysics, demonstrating a clear continuity with Vedic cosmology and ontology. We recall, too, that the Buddha passed through the five forms of existence (apparently a parallel of the post-samhita panca-jana-) and was therefore Pafcagatisamatikranta. There is also the lesser known Fivefold Path, the pan- cangika-magga of the Pali texts. Pentads occur in the ethical texts as well, such as the paica-slla, the fundamental code of the Buddhists, and the five vows of the Jains, both following the brahmanical pattern. At the monastic level the Buddha also advised the proper use of the paicabala, the five forces. The paica-mahdpdtaka, the "five deadly sins" of the dharma-sastras (also known to the Buddhists), are well known, and Manu discusses as well the five life-destructive kitchen imple- ments, including fire, for which expiation must be made. 10 A.

Hopkins, "Numerical Formulae in the Veda and Their Bearing on Vedic Criticism," Journal of the American Oriental Society 16 (1896):275-81, which also omits five. At the other end of the Indian chronology, the chapter on "The Power of Numbers" in J. Abbott, The Keys of Power: A Study of Indian Ritual and Belief (London: Methuen, 1932), pp. 284-309, assembled a great deal of information on con- temporary Hindu, Muslim, and assorted village and regional beliefs and practices concerning "five," but made no attempt to connect them with anything beyond current popular articulation.

Oldenberg's sections on "die Zahlen"11 and "das eine und die drei Opferfeuer" 12 are of little use where understanding five is concerned, and the same is true of the works of Hillebrandt and Macdonell. And Eggeling's twenty years of labor on the 8atapatha-brahmana translation, with its lengthy introductions and notes, left the basic pentadic symbolism of the agnicayana for the probing of others.13 Actually, we must go back to Bergaigne's "l'arithmetique mythologique"14 for some funda- mental insights into the Vedic world view. Despite his preoccupa- tion with a few favored themes, including a stringent imposition of the characters of Agni and Soma and a male-female dichotomy upon the Vedic ideology, and his focus upon the Rgveda in splendid isolation from its ritual and speculative textual col- leagues, Bergaigne's great effort deserves far more attention than it has received. In general, Bergaigne was the first to articu- late clearly and comprehensively the Vedic doctrine of cosmic correspondences. In particular, two of his insights concern us here-first, the formation of sacred numbers by a principle that we shall label "x plus one": Plusieurs des nombres mythologiques du Rg-Veda paraissent s'etre formes par addition d'une unite a un nombre deja consacre, ou sont du moins, ce qui revient au meme pour l'etude des conceptions religieuses des Rishis, decomposes dans certains passages en deux parties, dont l'une est un nombre consacre et l'autre l'unite.15 And second, his understanding of Vedic man's quest for cosmic orientation and an interpretation of the correspondences that the numeration and offers parallels in Bantu and Nama, the latter a Hottentot language in which the numeral "five" is also the word for "whole." Sanskrit panca does not enter his discussion, but he does relate Hittite panku, "all, whole," originally an adjective and often used substantively to express "totality." I am indebted to Alfred Hiltebeitel for bringing this article to my attention. 11 H.

Among the familiar examples of the extension of the principle into the brahmanas are the numbers thirteen (twelve plus one), as with the thirteenth month being the "total" year (AB.); seventeen (sixteen plus one), the sacred totality that is Prajapati (KB.); twenty-five (twenty-four plus one), as with the transcendent half-month that again comprises a new, complete year. 33</page><page sequence="7">One Fire, Three Fires, Five Fires Rgveda establishes between the five directions and the "five races." 16 Among the few who have appreciated and utilized Bergaigne's contributions at these points have been the prolific Vedic scholars in the Netherlands, the successors to Caland.17 In his "Excursus on the Symbolism of Numbers" it is Heesterman who ventures to say that numbers are "neutral" and "have no specific value in them- selves. ... As a number is in itself neutral, the size of the number is irrelevant." 18 Although his point is clear, that the formation of a number (i.e., x plus one equals totality) is of greater significance than its size, I beg to differ on the matter of neutrality. It is apparent that a Vedic delight in numerical symbolism and the doctrine of homologies combine to assure an incredible fluidity in the application of numerology within the rites and speculations. One need only consult the "offerings to the numbers" utilized in the asvamedha (TS. 7.2.11-20), where numbers from one to 100 and 1,000 to "ten hundred thousand million," with only moderate omissions, are praised. But if all numbers are (neutrally) equal, some are decidedly more "equal" than others. There is little doubt that three, four, and five have priority in Vedic texts. It is the point of our essay here that the major religious expressions of the Vedic texts reveal these basic triads, tetrads, and pentads precisely because they declare the ontology and cosmic orientations of Vedic man. It is readily apparent that specific numbers have special mythico-ritual spheres of influence; for example, Visnu admits a mystical relationship to the series three, and the number seventeen is the nearly private domain of Prajapati. "Die Zahlen- reihe," as Oldenberg expressed it, "wurde als ein brahman (heilige Formel) geehrt." But we must also recognize that the series most frequently resorted to in Vedic expression, the dyads through the pentads and septads, have deliberately private experiences to reveal. They are there because they are departures from unity, 16 Ibid., pp. 125-27, 129 ff. 17 See, for example, G. J. Held, The Mahdbhdrata: An Ethnological Study (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1935), pp. 123 ff.; J. C.

It is our contention here that each of the basic triadic, tetradic, and pentadic series makes a unique statement, still discernible within the convolutions and contradictions of the texts. "Three" is the vertical cosmos, the cosmos envisioned in elevation, reaching as it does to the third and highest world; "four" is the horizontal cosmos, the cosmos in plan, stretching to the four points of space; and "five" is quite simply both at once and therefore the most complete expression of all, one that provides transcendent closure to the world view. The facility of five lies in this expansion and comprehension: at its center it expands the verticality of the triad, and by the very declaration of a protected and integrated center, a navel (ndbhi, a cynosure that four, reaching outward, cannot precisely disclose), it surpasses the orientational values of the tetrad. If the religious statement of three is ascension, and of four orientation, then the true expression of five is, as we shall see, orientation for ascension. The center of five then is in communica- tion, and therefore correspondence (bandhu), with all three worlds and all four quarters. At such a point of comprehension, no further homology can be allowed. Satapatha-brahmana 1.5.4.6-16 relates a myth to seize this point exactly. The devas and asuras became engaged in a verbal contest, having previously failed to decide a physical one, and the competition took the form of matching numerical pairs. Indra, gamesman for the gods, said eka, "one" (masculine), and the asuras matched it with ekcd, "one" (feminine). Indra said dvau, "two" (masculine), and the asuras doggedly countered with dve, "two" (feminine). The match continued through "threes" and "fours" until the moment when Indra uttered panca, "five" (masculine and feminine), and the asuras, helpless without a correspondent to panca, were forced to surrender. TRANSCENDENCE OR SUBORDINATION Three is of course the dyad plus one and, therefore, a totality succeeding duality. "Wide-striding" Visnu's third step, after he ranges from earth to heaven, is one into the zenith, into the total mystery, the unitive source that lies beyond the pale of human perception (RV. 1.155.5; 7.99.1).19 But it is also mythically true 19 See Kuiper, pp. 139-40, and, in the same volume, S. Kramrisch, "Two: Its Significance in the Rgveda," pp. 109-36. On the "primordial totality" see also M. Eliade, Mephistopheles and the Androgyne (New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1965), pp. 114-17. 35</page><page sequence="9">One Fire, Three Fires, Five Fires that, after That One (tad ekam) became two, heaven and earth, there occurred between this pair that was no longer one, between the heaven that was "propped up" and the earth that was "spread out," the mid-space, the atmosphere (antariksa). Now antariksa can scarcely be a "totality" that encompasses, succeeds, and com- pletes the duality of heaven and earth, in the same manner as Visnu's third invisible stride. It is a gap, an interstice, a breathing space. There is then perhaps another dimension to consider in "x plus one," that is, "x plus a subordinate or interstitial one" as well as "x plus a transcendent one." If we look to "four," the number that completes the triad as well as the number of primary orientation to the quarters of the earth, it is remarkable to see how this bifurcation took effect. The addition of a subordinate fourth to a cosmic triad is easily illus- trated. In various discussions of cosmogony, Vac, Purusa, and brahman, the absolute creative power, are all hidden triads that have, in creation, extended themselves by a "manifest" fourth without disturbing their primordial integrity. In RV. 1.164.45, Vac has three parts that are hidden (guhd), while a fourth (turiya), obviously debased, is human speech. Similarly, in the cosmogonic Purusasfukta (RV. 10.90), only a fourth of Purusa's real extent is manifest. In that manifestation, the upper three parts of the primordial sacrifice victim, the mouth, arms, and loins that pro- duce the upper three varna-, are augmented by a diminutive fourth, the feet that are the source of the lowly suidra class.20 With this model, we can see other vulnerable tetrads, that is to say, significant Vedic or Hindu series of fours that reveal an essential triad complemented by a subordinate fourth. For example, the classical set of "four vedas" is really an artificial construction by those who appended the Atharvaveda-samhita to an existing triadic canon. The transcendent or unmanifest fourth, on the other hand, is illustrated in Vedic ritual by the role of the brahman, the fourth mahartvij whose supervisory capacity demonstrates his summation of and superiority over the other three, the hotr, adhvaryu, and udgdtr, just as brachman summarizes and surpasses the rc-, yajus-, and sdman-. Later, in the set of darama-, the samnydsin displays such a transcendent role in a (fourth) stage of life that is literally a 20 TS. 7.1.1.4-5 and TB. 6.1.6-11 provide illustrations of the incompleteness of such a fourth. Matching the three upper parts of the god and the three upper social classes of men are three deities (Agni, Indra, and Visve Devah ) and (in TB.) three seasons (spring, summer, and rains). But the feet/lftdra varna have no deity and no season. 36</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions return to the unmanifest, to the invisibility that lies beyond the brahmacdrin, the grhastha, and the vanaprastha. So, too, in the Hindu caturvarga, moksa is the transcendent aim over and above the trivarga, the three aims of life (kdma, artha, dharma). And turiya is well known, with no further definition, as "the fourth (state)" of the yogin who attains total reintegration and the transcendence of conscious states.21 Turning again to "five," it is apparent that many of the pentads we reviewed above are also vulnerable in that an essential tri- partition is barely concealed within them. This means that, in addition to being the figure of terrestrial orientation par excellence -a tetrad plus the completing, centering fifth-five can also be a formation of (1) an extended triad, either (a) three plus a trans- cendent pair or (b) three plus a subordinate pair, or (2) an expanded triad, three opened up to include two insertions. We have already witnessed with our point of departure in the ChU. five-fire doctrine, such a pentad constructed by extending an accepted triad: in that case, a subordinate pair of divine "fires," man and woman, were appended below the triad of cosmic fires, heaven-atmosphere (in the guise of "Parjanya")-earth. The common series of five seasons may also reveal such a reduction to an essential triad (spring, summer, and autumn or rains) with a subjacent pair.22 On the other hand, the triad with a transcendent pair is illustrated in the psycho-physical series of the five "sheaths" or kosa- (n. 4 above), in which, taking the TU. 2.8 listing, vijndna-maya and dnanda- maya surmount the anna-maya, prdna-maya, mano-maya series.23 21 See also van Buitenen, "Large Atman," p. 111, on mahas as the transcendent fourth beyond the vydhrti-, the three great ritual utterances (bhir, bhuvas, and suvas), and for other upanisadic tetrads from TU. 1.5.1-4. See also G. Tucci, The Theory and Practice of the Mandala (London: Rider, 1961), p. 117, for parallels of Vac as the fourth sound beyond the vydhrti-; brdhman as the macrocosmic fourth beyond earth, atmosphere, and heaven; brahmarandhra as the microcosmic fourth beyond sexual organs, heart, and brain; and turiya as the psychical fourth beyond jdgrat, svapna, and susupti. 22 Again, as in the example in n. 20 above, illustrations occur with comparative hierarchies for guidelines; e.g., Bharadvaja-srauta-sfitra 5.2 gives the seasons when members of the varna- should set up their srauta fires. After the brahmana, rajanya, and vaisya classes are assigned, respectively, the spring, summer (or winter), and autumn, the next two, rathakdra in the rains and "all varna-" in the cool season (is'ira), seem to be artificially tacked on. Baudhayana-dharma-sutra 2.18.8 declares the correspondence between the five breaths and the five ritual fires, both within the sacrificer's own body: prdna, apdna, and vydna and gdrhapatya, daksindgni, and dhavaniya are the two essentially correlative triads, appended by uddna/sabhya fire and samanad/vasathya fire. One notes that traditional priorities have been changed, as prdna, the supreme breath, is not here assigned to the east, the supreme quarter and the locale of the offering fire. 23 Another type of "extension" may also be considered. In a communication to me on this subject, Alex Wayman, of Columbia University, has pointed out that the five Buddhist skandha- can be seen as a triad (vedand, sarnjnd, and samskdra) with extensions at each end (ripa and vijnina). 37</page><page sequence="11">One Fire, Three Fires, Five Fires The third type of hidden triad, and the one that best illustrates the expansive character of the pentad when employed as a kind of axis mundi linking the lowest and highest modes of being, can be seen in the five elements themselves (n. 6 above). We see again, in the order in which they occur in Aitareya-upanisad 3.3, the earth- dkdsa-heaven (jyotis, "light") triad, this time spaced out to allow vdyu ("wind" or "air") and dpas ("water") in the second and fourth "levels," respectively. FIVE IS THREE IS ONE It is in the clarity, growth, and continuity of the doctrine of sacrifice that we may best perceive the meaning of this "spaced- out" pentadic stepladder to the beyond. The mysterious five steps (panca paddni) upward from the navel of rta are in the primary Vedas already a subject of speculative contrast with the three steps (trini paddni) upward (cf. RV. 10.13.3; AV. 18.3.40; 2.1.2;VS. 32.9). Persistently, the major srauta rites maintain the visibility of the essential triadic skeleton: Agni is threefold (RV. 3.20.2) and has three sacred locations (RV. 2.36.4). Since man is "in yajia- bandhu" with Agni (RV. 4.1.9), man is also tripartite fire. In setting out his sacrificial fires (the agnyddhdna), he simultaneously represents Agni, the triadic cosmos, the three classes of men, and his own sacrifice-self. The domestic fire (gdrhapatya) is the earth; the prophylatic fire (dakcsingni) is atmosphere, mid-space; the offering fire (dhavaniya) is heaven (cf. SB. 12.4.1.3). At the same time, the fivefold structure of the agnyddhdna is underscored (SB. 2.1.1.2), including the five ingredients and the fivefold nature of the attendant animal sacrifice (as in AV., above). The animal victim, like the sacrificer, Vedic man himself, is "heaven bound" (svar-ga). A long Atharvaveda-samhita hymn (9.5) stresses this ascension theme of the triad with the sacrifice of a goat and five rice offerings. The goat, too, is a tripartite body, his breast, his innards, and his back corresponding to earth, mid-space, and heaven, and all three being "fire." At the same time, the victim is declared "fivefold" and an integrator of the quarters. And the goat, as sacrifice-being, as unity, represents the sacrificer. Most expressive of all the rites that display this unity in trinity in fivefoldness is the agnicayana, the ceremonial reconstitution in five sections (in plan)24 and five layers (in elevation) of Agni- 24 Again, as in the Atharvavedic goat sacrifice or the agnyddhdna, the design of orientation for ascension is prominent. The sacrifice victim is laid out in plan with a navel (ndbhi) or central body (dtman) surrounded by an oriented tetrad of a head, two limbs or "wings," and a tail, the assembled fire altar thus permitting the 38</page><page sequence="12">History of Religions Prajapati, the cosmic Person who once projected (dismembered) himself into being. "If Agni is one (sacrificial brick, istakd, or course of bricks), how does it happen that he is five (bricks, courses) ?" asks 8B. 6.1.2.30, and it is the task of the agnirahasya, the mystery of the fire altar, to explain such correspondence. The five layers are in SB. 6.1.2.31 declared as earth, animal, gold (= sun, in mid-space), wood, food (=soma, in heaven). Thus, the "animal" and "plant" layers have become interstices expanding the triad. The skeletal nature of courses one, three, and five is reinforced by the references to "naturally perforated" bricks. These svayamdtrnnd- are placed at the center of three of the five layers in order to allow the sacrifice person "to breathe" and also, according to TS. 5.2.8.1, to permit the sight of heaven. The implication is that layers two and four are ephemeral stuff, interfering with neither breathing nor sighting through. The con- struction, its symbolic declarations, and its skeleton of the normal three-fire system and three-leveled cosmos appear in figure 1.

For the continuation of this speculation on the pentadic purusavidhah in the upanisads (TU. 2.2; Maitrayaniya-upanisad 6.33; cf. ChU. 4.11-13), see van Buitenen, Maitrdyaniya Upanisad, pp. 29-33, 55, passim. For example, the prefiguration of the paicakosa- series in the TU. is paralleled in the Maitrayaniya- upanisad: a vertical triad is extended from its pentadically defined base into a vertical pentad by the addition of the transcendent pair (4) dtmavid and (5) brahman, equivalent to (4) vijidnamaya dtman and (5) dnandamaya dtman, respec- tively, of the TU. series. This speculation appears in a part of the Maitrayaniya- upanisad understood by van Buitenen to be older than the TU., although still derivative from such SB. expressions as that of 10.5.4.3, where the triad of worlds becomes a pentad by the addition of a transcendent pair of citi-. 25 One of the more intriguing but unstudied motifs in Vedic myth-ritual is that of the "earth diver," particularly in connection with the search for Agni. Zoo- logical figures (ant, boar, tortoise, rat, mole, crab, goat, antelope, etc.) and botanical symbols (soma, soma substitutes, lotus) form a cosmogonic complex that explains the findings of a micropresence and from it the establishment of a foundation (pratisthd) of earth upon the primeval waters. 39</page><page sequence="13">One Fire, Three Fires, Five Fires this pentadic tower, with water in the atmospheric (third) level and gold in the second level. In order, from the bottom up, the layers are established on a lotus leaf "afloat" on a black antelope skin: earth (clay from an anthill), gold, water, plants, and food. Still another variant of this ritual collection of layers is that of the sitras which set out the details of the pravargya. If we are meant here to understand a hidden correspondence between gold and the earth procured from an anthill (the classical nuggets mined by ant miners ?), we have the following pentad: earth (clay dug up by a boar), gold (anthill earth), plants (putika, a soma substitute), animal (hairs from a goat or black antelope), and food (goat's milk).26 These five substances are the components of the clay that is ritually lumped together to form three balls and, consequently, the iconic mahdvira figure. The mahdvira pot, with its head, trunk, and loins modeled from the three clay balls, is an anthropomorphic, trileveled cosmos. His creation, then, if our analysis of the five substances in series is not mistaken, is parallel to the reconstitution of Agni-Prajapati; it is an assembly of five to make three to make one.27 26 Apastamba-srautasfitra 15.1.8-14 (see J. A. B. van Buitenen, The Pravargya: An Ancient Indian Iconic Ritual Described and Annotated [Poona: Deccan College, 1968], pp. 56-57) actually specifies only the first four of these ingredients. But Baudhayana, Manava, and Katyayana all supply goat's milk; for Baudhayana the milk is the fifth ingredient and is addressed when placed as "the seed of Prajfpati." 27 We have made no mention of pentadic symbols older than the Rgvedic expressions. There is little to suggest proto-Indo-European substrata. Astonish- ingly, however, the Avesta, while in general displaying far less interest than the Rgveda in pentadic expressions, does suddenly deliver in the midst of all the favored triadic formulas a precise cosmogonic speculation based upon a hierarchy of five fires! This occurrence creates an intriguing problem, since we have noted that Vedic and then Hindu myths, rites, and speculations develop an increasing proliferation of fivefold symbols while holding onto the preeminent triadic and unitive structures. Yasna 17.1-10 (cf. the further elaboration in the Pahlavi Bundahisn 18) opens with a standard invocation of Fire, dtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, then continues with the praise of the fires barazisavah, vohufrydna, urvdzi?ta, vdzista, and spsnista. Respectively, these are the fire that is before the Lord, i.e., in heaven; the fire in the bodies of men and animals; the fire in trees and plants; the fire of lightning in the clouds, the fire that strikes the demon spanjagrya who hinders rainfall (cf. Videvdat 19.135); and the fire that works on earth. It requires no stretch of the imagination to see that we have here the five ingredients collected in the cosmogonic search for Agni in TS. 4.1.2 and the same pentadic series, with parts rearranged, that we discussed in the agnicayana and the pravargya myth-rites. The {B. pattern assigns gold (the sun) as the representative of the atmospheric mid-space, while in the Yasna it is the rain clouds, the atmospheric waters: 3. Heaven barszisavah 5. Heaven urvdzista 4. Plants 2. Atmosphere vdzista 3. Water vohufrydna 2. Animals 1. Earth spani?ta 1.

The great rite dissolves then into a recognition that the "search" for Agni, the "collecting" and reassembly of Agni (and the sacrificer and the cosmos), amounts to an affirmation of his very presence in every element. To realize his unity, the five seasons (time), the five regions (space), the five victims (mankind), the five breaths, the five elements, and the five bodily parts all were collected to establish the one great fire signaling a return to the mystery of unmanifest being. The sacrificer then has become one fire (Agni), returned from his nature as Visnu with one body in three places (VS. 23.50) and from his nature as Purusa with one spirit in five places (VS. 23.52; cf. 8B. 13.5.2.11 if.). He has collected and con- trolled and transcended the fivefoldness, and there is no death for him whose body is made of the one fire of yoga.28 justice), is that fire is in all the cosmic elements. This is precisely the Vedic state- ment regarding Agni. There is not space here to discuss other important dimen- sions such as the Iranian correspondence of three hierarchical fires and social classes, with a highest "king of fires" that could be seen as transcendent fourth, or the myth-ritual collecting of sixteen (or seventeen) fires, a drama as complicated as the agnicayana itself.
