IN a Paper read by the present writer to the Lancashire and Cheshire and Antiquarian Society, in February, 1889, on "The Meaning of Ornament," it was maintained that "Zoomorphs took their place in the expectant mind by virtue of some symbolic or mythological meaning, and when this was lost, animal forms were reproduced by the artificer with less attention to detail, and only to satisfy a vague desire for something mystical or auspicious." But one of the principal purposes of that Paper was to show how the animal form passed into ornament under the control and determination of a pre-existent" skeuomorph" or structure- form, although different "skeuomorphs" became dominant at different times and among different nations. It was further noticed that "the effect of the tool was best seen in savage ornamentation where decorative motives had been transferred, for example, to clubs and paddles. The limited power of the stone implement, no less than the grain and hardness of the wood, greatly modified the ' skeuomorphs'</page><page sequence="2">308 H. C. MARCH.--Polynesian Ornament a MyUbthography; of bindingy, of wattlework, and of weaving, and colntrolled also, in large measure, the way in which the tribal zoomorph ultimately broke up." And it was pointed out that in many of those cases " though the eye telnded to remain as a concentric ring, and the tongue persisted as a curious ovoid, the limbs were chang,ed into a number of semnilunes or synclinal curves, easily to be distinguished from pre-existent structure-forms." Dr. Stolpe has since demonstrated, with the utmost con- clusiveness, how, on paddles and axes from the Hervey Islands, the human figure is transformed into a zigzag; thouoh he does not recognise the fact that the transformation is brought to its final stage under the influence of a paramount " skeuomorph." I now propose to discuss, on similar lines, anid in close relation to Dr. Stolpe's essay, the zoomorphic ornamentation of the Pacific Islands and of Mangaia in particular. The Tongans, says Surgeon Anderson, one of Captain Cook's following (Edition 1790, p. 1639) " constantly refer pain froin grief, anixiety, and other affections, to the bowels." Whlen animals were inspected for augury it was the convulsive move- ments of the intestines that gave the desired indication to the Tahitians (p. 1540). The primary meaning of the word manava is "belly'" (Davies, Pratt, W. Williams) and " womb " (Pratt), but as these regions were regarded as the seat of life and feeling, the word acquired a corresponding seconidary sense and signified also "the interior mans" (Davies) and "the breath " or spirit (W. Williams). "Mailava'"! was shouted as a greeting to the Areois who were famous for their licentious practices. An intoxicating drink was prepared from kava, a root called in Polynesian mythology ]Tevoo (Gill's "Myths," &amp;c., p. 161), and in the Drama of Ngaru we read Akiakia tute kava, te manava ia ]Tevoo, " strip the branches off the kava-tree, thby senses to stupefy." Williams, the missionary, speaks of " a strino of small pieces of polished pearl-shells, which were said to be the manava or soul of the god " (Edition 1838, p. 99); the epithet te manava roa, literally "the big belly," signifies " the lonig lived " (Gill's " Myths," p. 128) ; whilst, with the causati-e prefix, ta-manava, " to be bellied," means to be heavy with sleep (Davies). Opu, another word for belly, is also uised to design(ate "the mind " (Davies), and opu tii signifies " a very large belly like that of the tii or tiki which was always made large" (Davies). The first symbol to be noticed, then, is that of abdominal protuberance, the hands usually resting uponi it, which repre- sents the soul and stands for the imiimortality or rather the longevity of the gods and of the early ancestors of man. (Fig. 6.) For recently deceased persons there was another symbol. Mr. Charles Read in a Paper published in the Journal of this</page><page sequence="3">or, a Symabolisia of Origim and Desccmt. 309 Institute (November, 1891) refers to " Ellis, II, p. 217, where at figure of an Altar and Unus is givenl," and adds, " I cannot find any account of the Unus in the text, though they shouild be figures of gods." Williams says that the unqms are " sacred pieces of carved wood by which the marae was decorated" (p. 152). Cook speaks of them as " pieces of carved wood in which their gods were supposed to reside occasionially" (p. 1542). Indeed, Ellis himself (lst Edition II, 214; 2nd Edition 1, 348), says, "e the units are curiously carved pieces of wood, marking the sacred places of interment, and emblematical of tiis, tikis, or spirits"; whilst Davies gives, as the meeaning of unu, "a piece of carved wood put up in the marae on sacrificing a maii." It appears that the act of death was called unuli te varua e te atul,a, "the voice (or spirit) drawn out by the god." H'T is " to gush out " like water or blood, and unuhi is " to draw some- thing ollt of its case " as a knife from its sheatlh or a sword from its scabbard; or, as we miaht say, a fruit from its lLusk or a jewel from its casket. In the New Zealand tongrue unu is " to pull out," passive ztnhia (W. Williams). As soon as the human spirit was drawn out through the head of the body, it was carried off by oromatuas, who were always in wait to receive it, in order that it might be eatern by the gods. It was believed that a spirit that had been thus eaten and had passed throug,h the intestines of the gods three tinmes, became deified or imperishable (2nd Ellis I, 397); but the process was not regarded with pleasurable anticipation. The word oro is "to grate the taro," to prepare food; a final a is intensive, anid oroa is " a feast "; orolhea is " a glutton," one whlo makes himself ill with eating; htea-oromatua is " a sickness caused by an orom7watua." Matua or metua is "a parenlt" or ancestor; ai-dattca is "to eat with old men"; the intensive qmatuatqua is "ancient," especially in relation to lineage. Thus oromatuas are ancestral spirits who prepare food for the gods. Ellis (I, 334) anid Davies (p. 100) call them the ohosts of dead relatives. Gili ("Jottings," p. 64) speaks of the miiarae of Tima- pera, " the whisker away," who loved to steal meii, women, and children. Thle mnu was the symbol of a man whose spirit liad. beei drawn out of his body, and the holes at the top of it probably represent the openings through which this abstractioin was imiade. Jfaa means " cleft," and qtnu-maa is 'the unt before a marae that has branches or divisions." Most of the unus figured bly Cook answer to this description. They were set up in the iiiarae, a sepulchral enclosure, together with prepared skulls, in ordei to deceive anid attract predatory ghosts, aiid keep them fromii seekina fresh victims; and the skulls thus employed went by the saine designation, orornatc-aas (Davies). Ellis says (T, 363)</page><page sequence="4">310 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian O,9tagent a Kythography; " tlle orocatitas were colnsidered the inost malignant of beings; they were not confined to the skulls of departed warriors, or to tlie images made for them, but occasiolnally resorted to sea- shells, and the murmur perceived on applying the valve to the ear was imagilned to proceed frolml the demon it contained." I have ascertained that a skull will " sino in the wind"; and we, cannot doubt that a strong current of air would whistle through the openings of the unW. Ellis classes the oromatuas with tii or tiki (I, 334). He says, too, that a departed spirit was believed to be sent for or fetched by the gods. And Gill declares (" Myths," p. 181) that when a person dies his spirit is said to be fetched, and that " fetched" is the meaningr of the word tiki, as it also is in New Zealand (W. Williams). Guided by this clue we may thread our way tllrough inuch confusioln. fTikis or tiis were spirits or d(emons, but they were ancestral spirits. And it is obvious that the first ancestral spirit must have belonged to the first man, and that his wife was the first woman. Tiii, says Ellis (I, 1il) "was the first man made by the gods. His wife was sometimes called Tii and sometimes Hina [the moon]. WVhell they died their spirits were supposed to survive and so tile term tit came to be applied generally to the spirits of the departed." But it cannot be doubtful that the mienltal process in the construction of the leoend was exactly the reverse, and that the story itself is eponymic. Tn New Zealand Tiki was a protecting genius, a kind of household god, and hte was usually represented with hands, comiiposed of three fingers, resting upon a protuberant abdomen. Cook says (Edition 1784, I, 162) of the New Zealanders that " they carve pieces of their green-stone, rudely shaped as human figutres, which they ornamenit with brighit eyes of pearl-shell and hangr themll about their necks as memorials [after the deatlh] of those whom they held nmost dear." In the Society Islalnds " a tii or carved image, fixed on a higlh pedestal, marked the bouidLary of the kingi's territory" (Ellis III, 106);,and similar figures were often placed oln the lofty sterns of the canoes (Ellis 1, 153). Such a vessel was called vaa-tii (ibid. p. 154). "A locr of wood on wllich were carved Tiki imiages on its whole length, and which was set up as the guardiall of the tapu, was called Po-tuarua " (Davies); fronm po the under-world, aiid tuarzu., "a piece of wood on the ridoe of a nlative liouse," with the intensive a. Though niot a god-originator, Tiki reiglned ill Po or Avaiki, tlle under-world, the laind of shadows, the road to whicl lay througll a gloomy cavernl in the centre of Mangaia kniown as Tiki's Clhasm (Gill's " Mytlhs," p. 18).

But on Mangaia, continues Gill, "Tiki is a woman, the first who died a natural [or woman's] death." In a dirge recited by the same author (" Myths," p. 281) some bereaved parents who grieve for the death of their first-born recall the story of Tiki as they clothe themselves in the habiliments of woe. At Rarotonga it was customary to offer parts of a hog, or other food, to Tiki who thus propitiated admitted souLls within his dwelling (Gill," Myths," p. 170). After such an offerinig tlle deceased was told "Go, there is momoe o, thine admission fee; with that seek an entrance ilnto the abode of Tiki" (Williams, p. 478). The word in its reduplicate form tiki-tiki, indicates ancestry il the sense of pedigree, as shown (Grey's " Polynesian Mythology," pp. 17, 18) in the legend of Maui, who desired to finid ouit whe1 e Taranga, his mother or ancestress, lived. Wheni she denied hitn, he reminded her " I was thrown by you into the foam of the surf, after you had wrapped me up in a tuft of goar hair, which you had cut off for that purpose." Then his mother acknowledged her child and said "your name shall be MIaui-tiki-tiki-a-Tarang,a." For this reason tiki-tikki sometimes signifies a top-knot. The more definiteterm for ancestors, tik-i-tiki tangata, also gave rise to an eponymic legend. Ti'angata or taata is ag eneric name for man. We are told (Ellis, I, 113) that Taaroa's, Or Tangaroa's, son, Tii-rnaaraatai [maa food, raa sacred, tai sea] and daughter Hina begat Tii and Hina-ereeremonoi [ereere swarthy, monoi fragrant], and these begat a son called Taata or Tangata. Thus we have a son Tiki, a grandson Tiki, and a g-reat-grandson Tangata, or Tiki-tiki-tangata. As might be supposed, the tikis, as ancestral spirits or demons, were especially mischievous in the dark, and the festival of Tiki tle great ancestor was held at night. A Polyniesian chorus tlhus conieludes (Gill's "Myths," p. 50), "Day is at hand, 'Tis dawn, The fete of Tiki is over, We part! " The word ata means "a shadow"; anid the clouds of early nmorniing, that vanish before the rising sun, were called ata-tii-tii (Davies). What are the Polynesian legends of orig,in ? 1. There is abundant evidence of an ancient totemiiism. Vari, a word which means ooze or earth, origin-ated Yatea who was half man and half fish (Gill, p. 3). The New Zealalnd Tangaroa begat Punga, and he begat Ika-tere, the father of fishies, and Tu-te-wehi-welhi, the father of reptiles (Grey, p. 7). The Great Spirit, or Influence,</page><page sequence="6">312 H. C. MARTcH.-Polynesian Ornanient a Mythography; "Mana-ia," had the similitude of a bird; and in Easter Island "Mekemeke," the Great Spirit of the Sea, had a like form. Every Samoan chief of note had his etu. This was some species of bird, fish, or reptile, in which the spirit of the god was supposed to reside. To eat this etu was the highest act of desecration (Williams, p. 373). Willianms says (p. 427) that vampire bats abound in the Samoan islands, and in Mangaia, and were venerated by the Samoans as etus. But Pratt calls them " fruit bats," Pteropus Samnoensis, and says their native namne is pea, which is also a title of nobility. They have large ears. Fourteen genera of lizards are found in Polynesia. Some of them have oval eyes, or orbits, and in others the eyes are quite cireular. A Papuan variety has five toes but only four fingers, and the crocodile of Oceania has only four toes. Vatea's third offspring was Tongaiti, whose visible form was the white and black-spotted lizard (Gill, p. lO). The lizard-god Mataran had his marae at Aumoana, Tainarua (Gill, p. 291). The lizard-god Teipe was worshipped at Mangaia (p. 307), and a special song was chanted by his altar-tribe. In Marua, the land of shades, lived Ngaru's grandfather, or ancestor, who was no other than Moko, the Great Lizard, the king of all lizards (Gill, p. 225). As the Greek sculptor enidowed his Fawn with a pointed ear, or with the neck-glands of a goat, so the Poly- nesian artist gave to his Divinity a bat-like auricle, reptilian eyes, and the toes and fingers of a lizard. In one of its aspects, totemism is a doctrine of descent; the divine ancestor is bestial. But origin was also claimed from anthropomorphic gods; and the priimal fecundity was regarded as having occurred either uinisexually by gemmation, or bisexually by generation. All things proceeded from the gods in one of these two ways. 2. The epicene process of genimation, although not unknown in other mythologies, was, among the Polynesians, a favourite mode of accounting for the origin of men and things. The principal terms, says Gill (p. 21), used by the ancient sages in speakingr of genesis, are varn, which means ooze, and pita whicl means a bud. Grammatically, these are both femninine words. In his description of the chestnut of the Pacific, Gill observes ('; Jottings," p. 195), "the fruit hangs singly, or in clusters, from slender twigs; but occasionally from the trunk. itself, which is suipposed to oe a special mllark of divine favour." Inside the effigy of Tangaroa," the supreme sustainer," the great national god of the Hervey Group, the creator of all things, "was found a multitude of small gods " (Williams, p. 93). Besides, he is usually represented as a virile figure, covered all over, head,trunk, alnd limbs, with smnall images of human beings (Ellis, I, 355).</page><page sequence="7">or, a Symbolism of Origin aind -Descent. 313 Cook (pp. 83, 576) speaks of a wicker-work figure in Tahiti, "near seven feet in height, covered with black and white feathers: w,hite where the skin should appear, and black in those parts which it is the custom to paint or stain, or where it represented hair. On the head were four protuberances, three in front and one behind, called taata iti, or little men. The image was an Atua," or god. A more elaborate account (Gill) gives the parents of Tanga- roa a similar origin. Vari, "the very beginning," ooze or mlud, was anxious for progeny, and plucked off a bit of her right side, and it became Vatea who by his union with his sister Tu-metua, or Tu-papa, also a bud fromli Vari, became the father of Tangaroa, Rongo, and Tane. But according to another myth (Gill, p. 10) Tangaroa himself came right up through his mother's head. It is necessary to glance at similar mythologies. We read in the Kalevala (Translation by Leonzon le Duc, Paris, p. 436), the Epic of the Fins, this invocation: "0 adorable Kave, Nature's daughter, Lady of beauty and of wealtli, the most ancient of wives, the first of those mothers who are born of themselves ! " We recall the birth of Athena, who sprang fully armed fromii the head of Zeus. On vase-paintiiigs Hephaistos is usually represented as starting aside with amazement, after he has cleft the head of the supreme god. But on vases of the old style, Zeus, in the presence of the celestial court, is seen in the, act of parturitior., wvith the assistance of two Eileitlhyias or mid-wives. The masculine Loki, the Norse god of evil, is spoken of as " growing heavy with a female child " (" Corp. Boreale," I, 232). In Hebrew mythology Eve is produced from Adamii by gem- mation. He then unites himnself with his own daughter, and their progeny, brothers and sisters, intermarry (Genesis ii, 22,23). Professor Sayce remarks that a passage in one of the early magical texts of Babylonia goes to show that the Babylonianis also believed that woman was produced fromii man (" PRecords of the Past," I, 131). The passage is tlhis: " The woman from the loins of the man the spirits bring forth; the child from the knees of the man they cause to issue" ("Hibbert Lectures," 1887, p. 451). The ancient idea of epicene fecundity may be dimly seen even in the religion of Europe. " Pater ingenitus, quia a nullo est genitus; Filius eo quod a patre est genitus; Spiritus Sanctus nec genitus nec ingenitua, sed ex Patre et Filio, ex utroque procedens est" (Theodulf's " Commentary on the Athanasian Creed," Cent viii). From all this it would appear that the position of the hands in the Polynesian symbol of divinity, resting, as they usually</page><page sequence="8">314 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian Ornament a lythography; do, upon a protuberant abdomen, whether ferniniile or mascu- line, may indicate more than the longer life, the larger soul of a god; they may point also to lives that have been and that are to come. And the same attitude, so frequenit ill Oceania, occurs also in the early statuettes of the Chaldceai goddess of fertility (Perrot et Chipiez, " Plhcenicia and Cyprus," I, 219, fig. 150; II, 154, fig. 104). To a simple people, possessed of such a mythology, no other symbolism was possible, and it demands all the reverence that we owe to religion. Even the winds have niamles in which the word anau, "give birth to," several times occurs (Gill, "Myths," p. 321). Thus, the North wind veering towards the West, gives birth to the North-by-West. And in miany of the New Zealand representations of suipreme diviniity, we see issuing from their loins, not human figures only, but instruments of war and the chase, for these also came from the gods. 3. In New Zealand, too, is found the best example of the bisexual doctrine of origin. Rangi anti Papa, or Heaven and Earth, originated all things. But a time caame when they had to be " rent apart." This was long ago, for it was a com-mon sayinig that " the like has never been seen before since Rangi and Papa were torn asuinder " (Grey, p. 31). Tangaroa tried in vain to separate them, and Tu-matauenga also failed, but Tane- mahuta, the god and father of forests, birds, and insects, suc- ceeded. Then PRangi annd Papa shrieked, "Why do you rend your parents apart ? " No sooiner was heaven rent from eartlh than mllultitudes of human beings were discovered whom they had begotten, and who had hitherto lain concealed between the bodies of Rangi and Papa (Grey, p. 14). But though separated their mutual love continues, for the myriad rain-drops are their tears. The sctilpthired represenitation of this creation-myth, Tnot in- frequenitly met with on the sacred " feather-boxes " of chiefs, must be regarded with the utmost respect. One such receptacle is called "Paparuakuara," and another is said to be that of " Te iRang,ihaiata " (British Museum). Professor Sayee considers that the Egyptian crux ansata, the symbol of life, is a picture of the loiii-girdle. Gill tells us (" Myths," p. 35) that a common name for a god is tatua manava or " loin-belt." That this girdle was originally made of native cloth is shown by the fact that both in the Sandwich Islands (Ellis, I, 179), and in the Society Islands (Cook, p. 760, aild Davies, sub voce) the word tapa means " the groili." The sym- bolic eimployment of tapa in Polynesian religion was universal. Gill refers (" Myths," p. 33) to the worship of what he calls i' phallic stones." Cook translates tootoone " stones such as stand upright before the huts" (tqttna, to be high above the rest, Pratt; tt to staiid erect, nea the first, Davies).</page><page sequence="9">or, a Symnbolism of Origin ancd Descent. 315 "In this mnorai,"' says Cook, referrinlg to Tahiti (p. 1542), " we saw several reliques scattered about, such as small stones raised in various parts of the pavement, some with bits of cloth fastened romnd them, and others entirely covered with it arid here was laid the bundle supposed to contain the god Ooro." Williams (p. 152) mentions that " four great idols were disrobe(d of the cloth in which they were enveloped." Ellis (I, 335) observes that the tii who were " anointed with frag,rant oil an,,id kept wrapped in the choicest kinds of cloth" were brouight out "every three moons." At this pae atna, or general exhibitioi of the gods, their coverings were removed. they were gnehea, "exposed to the sun," re-anointed with oil, anld ietLuriied to their wrappings. As sym-fbolic coverinigs, both matting and sinnet seem to have been equivalent to tapa. Williams speaking, of Savaii says (p. 375) " Papo the god of war, who was always attached to the leader's canoe when he went forth to battle, was nlothinog more than a piece of old rotten matting abont 3 yards long and 4 inches in width. It is flow in the Museum." Ellis says " the idols were either rough unpolished logs of the aito tree, wrapped in sacred cloth, rudely carved wooden images, or slhapeless pieces cover-ed with curiously netted sinnet" (I, p. 337). Some were 6 or 8 feet long and some niot more than as maniy inches. As regards Mangaia, we learn from Gill that " the principal gods were simply pieces of iron-wood roughly carved into the huminan shape and well wrapped in native cloth" (" Myths," p. 107); that one god named Mokoiro, grandson of Rongo (p. 16) " was made entirely of sinnet ("Jottings," p. 206); that the ex- tremity of a great cocoa-nut leaf, when cut off and bound witl a bit of yellow sinnet by the priest. constituted the fishermali's god; and that without this Mokoiro, as the divinity was called, no canoe would venture over the reef to fish " (" Myths," p. 79). The Tahitian word for sinnet is aha. The first enemy slain in battle was called aha because a piece of sinnlet was tied to him, and he was taken to a marae and prayers were made over him for further success. These ceremonies were called aha taata. When a pig was devoted to a god a piece of sinnet was put iiito its ear. A worker of enchantments was called nanati ahta, a sinnet tier. It was the custom for a fleet of canoes to present a piece of sinnet at the marae as an acknowledrment of the protection of the gods (Davies, sub vocibus). Perhaps it oug,ht to be noticed, here, that the chief inarriage ceremony in the Sandwich Islands consisted in the brideg-room's castinig a piece of tapa over the bricde, in the presence of her parenfts (Ellis, IV, 4:35). All natiolns tink themselves descended from the gods.

MARCH.-Polynesian O'rtament a J3fythography; Teutonic races, by an unbroken family tree, proved that they were the genetic offspring of Woden. Cook, speakinlg, of Tahiti (p. 560) says "there is perhaps no nation where the pride of ancestry is carried to a greater height." Recent discoveries at Easter Island have made it clear that multitudes of wooden documents, covered with inscriptions, are elaborate tables of descent. Ellis, referring to Tahiti (III, 94), declares that " the genealogy of the reigning family was usually traced back to the first ages of their traditionary history, and the kinas in some of the islands were descended from the gods; whilst the sove- reigns of the Sandwich Islands derived their origin from the gods by linea-l descent." He further says (I, 12a) "the genea- logies of the northern islands extend much farther back than those of the southern islands"; and (p. 86) " one method of reckoning time was by uis or generations." Grey, too, notices ("Polynesian Mythology," p. 272) that "from Tuparahaki in eleven generations, or in about 275 years, have sprung all the princi- pal clhiefs of the Ngatipaoa tribe now living "-and the word ngati itself has a genetic meaning,. It is probable that the male, rather than the female, line was followed in most of the pedigrees. But Gill informs us ("Jotting,s," p. 113) that " Mangaia was anciently ruled by the kings in the name of the invisible gods. These supreme spiritual rulers, though of a distinct and superior family, claiming, descent from greatl Ronao, father of gods and chiefs, must on the maternal side be related to the commion people. Native Christians speak of .Tesus, the visible representation of the true God, as being, allied to us sinful creatures in a similar way (ivi tcama vaine)." Now, tamca is "a child," ccva is " the wife of a common man " (Pratt), ivi is "a wvidow," and ivi vacine is " a widow woman " (Davies), or, doubtless, a husbandless woman; and so Christ is called " the child of a husbandless woman who was onie of the people." Indeed all illeg,itimate children were designated tarn- cariki na te Ataa, children of the gods (Gill's "Myths," p. 121); and there was a special form of baptism for infants whose fathers were unknown (Grey, p. 234). It is certain that some tribes traced tl eir descent through the female line. This may seem stralnge in view of the prevalent notion that Polynesian woman were regarded as inferior and unworthy-an erroneous opinion, the result of hasty and im- perfect obseivation. Suirgeon Anderson says (Cook, p. 1643), "The women of Tahiti have not only the mortification of being, obliged to eat by tlhemiiselves and in a different part of the house fron tlhe men, but are excluded fromn a share of the better sorts of food such as turtle, tunny, and some sorts of plantains. They seldom eat pork. The children of each sex also eat apart. The reason they gTave for all this was that it is right and neces-</page><page sequence="11">or, a Symbolis'm of Origin and Descent. 3[7 sary it should be so." But what made it right and necessary Anderson did not ascertain. Speaking of the Sandwich islanders he says, " At Oneeheow no instance was observed of the men and women eating together. The latter seemed in general to be associated in companies by themselves " (p. 1717). " At Owhyee the women eat apart fronm the other sex, and are pro- hibited from feeding on pork, turtle, and some particular species of plantains. Notwithstandiing this interdict, they would eat pork with us privately, but we could never prevail on them to taste the two latter articles of food" (p. 2050). Now it is well known that the pig, at that time, was of re- cent introduction, and the reasons why women should not eat its flesh could not have had a sanction so ancient as that which forbade them turtle and plantains. The mystery is unconsciously explained by Gill ("Jottings," p. 147) who says, " Turtles and porpoises were eaten only by men. The superstition was that if a woman ate of the porpoise her children would have porpoise faces." We may suppose that this belief was afterwards extended to the pig. As regards the plantain, a similar reason must be sought. Cook observes, in his account of the great marae at Tahiti (p. 84), that " several plantains, and trees which the natives call etoa, grew within the enclosure." In another place he says that the same word etoa is a general name for the male of any animal. Tloa, the native terni for the casuarina, or iron-wood tree, signi- fies also that which is savage or bloody (Davies). The intensive toa toa is to be disgusted, and toatoa-papu is the sickness of pregnancy. Of the plantain, Cook says (p. 1568), "it was always the first thing introduiced in all their religious cere- monies." As all red things belonged of right to Tangaroa, the -plantain was the property of that god " because of the redness and uprightness of its fruit " (Gill's " Myths," p. 12). One of its names was uat'u, from ua to sprout, and tu erect. It is highly probable, then, that for some reason, perhaps only eponymic in origin, certain trees and fruits were regarded as injurious to maternal functiolls. Gill remarks that "it was formerly un- lawful for women to eat eels, and to this day they mostly turn away from this fish with the utmost disgust" (" Myths," p. 79). Moreover, it may be noticed that the Areoi, a strange as- sociation of men and women. who prohibited the rearing of any offspring and practised total infanticide, at the feast of admission to their society " removed the tabu on females who partook witl man of the pig and other sacred food" (Ellis, I, 233, 243). With respect to the custom of eating apart, Cook made many sagacious observations. He says that in New Zealand (p. 178) "both sexes eat together," but that the inhabitants of VOL. XXII. y</page><page sequence="12">318 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian Ornament ca Mythography; Tahiti (p. 95) "though apparently fond of tlle pleasures of society, have yet an aversion to holding any intercourse witli each other at their meals. Even brothers and sisters have their separate baskets of provisions and generally sit at the distance of some yards when tlhey eat, with their backs to each other." In another place he says of the same people (p. 561), "The women are not permitted to eat with the men, not it should seem to mark their inferiority, but in conformity to a custom which habit has established into a law. Nor is it usual for any of them to eat in company, except upon certain days of festivity." " The captain (p. 996) invited Queen Oberea and her retinue to come on board the ship where an elegant dinner was prepared, of which all but the queen ate heartily; but she would neither eat nor drink." At Tonga " the women are not excluded from taking their daily repast in company with the men; but there are certain ranks that are not allowed either to eat or drink together" (p. 1489). " The captain dined on shore, Poulaho [the king] sat down by him, but would neither eat nor drink, which was owing to the presence of a female [Moungoula-kaipa] who had been admitted at his request to the dining party, and who, as we were informed, was of superior rank to himself. This lady had no sooner dined, etc." (p. 1431). Further on (p. 1497) the matter is explained: "The late king, father of Poulaho, left behind him a sister of equal rank and older than himself. She, by a native of Feejee, had a son and two daughters. These three persons, as well as their mother, are of higher rank than the king, and are called Tiammaha, which denotes a chief. One of the daughters is called Moungoula-kaipa." More light is thrown on the subject by an important passage in Miss Farmer's "Tonga" (p. 145). "Tui-tonga (= king of Tonga) is a priest-king. The civil governor is his brother, Tui-kanokubolu (= king of all the islands). Tui-tonaa must marry the daughter of hts brother. When she has had one or two children, she is taken away from him. Her son becomes the next Tui-tonga, and her daughter is called Tui-tonga Fefine (= the lady Tui-tonga). Her dignity is very great. Her rank is too high for her to marry any mortal, but she may have a family, and in case of the birth of a daughter, this child becomes the Tamaha, who rises higher than her mother in rank and is nearer the gods. Every one approaches her with gifts and homage. Her grandfather will bring his offerings and sit down before her. Sick people come to her for cure." Miss Farmer asks (p. 134) whether this respect for women accounts for a Tongan legend that, for the first men, wives were brought in a canoe fromii Bulotu, the land of spirits. Even Williams, who says so much about the inferiority of</page><page sequence="13">or, a Syrmbolisn?, of Origin a,nd Descent. 319 women in the Society Islands, tells us (p. 322 and 348) that Tamatoa was the patriarch of royalty, for his eldest daughter was governor of Huahine, and his grand-daughter was queen of Tahiti. And Cook remarks (p. 78) that a bov called Terridiri, who was heir-apparent to the sovereignty of these islands, at the proper age. was to marry his own sister. As regards the Sandwich Islands, Cook records (p. 1,706) that in a morai on Atooi stood "two images near 3 feet high, cut out of one piece of wood, with pedestals. They were said to be Eatooa 11o Veheina or representations of goddesses." The importance which was attached to the female element in relation to progeny is well shown by a proverb. Surgeon Anderson (Cook, V, 1652) mentions three characteristics of the sovereign: being invested with the maro, presiding at human sacrifices, and blowin, the conch-shell. Ellis records the proverb (I, 83), " If black be the complexion of the mother, the son will sound the conch-shell; if vigorous and strona the mother, the son will be a governor." Lastly, the eponymic legends of New Zealand abound with stories of ancestresses. Maui, whose name signifies "to form or make," goes to his ancestress, Muri, for her magic jawbone, for he wanted a piece of it to point his fish-hook withal. Maui's mother sent him to her great ancestress, for with her lnail she produced fire. And Maui's ancestress, Hine, was the goddess of death. (Grey's " Polyn. Myth.," pp. 35-69. Cf. inaui fata, " altar raising," Ellis, I, 349. Elsewhere it has been stated that the word qmaui means " the asker of questions.") Thus a presumption has been established, it has been- made a priori probable, that descent would be claimed along a female line as well as by paternity. Had the Polynesians any means of recording degrees of descent? On Pasque Island, where a written language of a hieroglyphic nature was employed, genealogies were elaborately inscribed on slabs of drift wood (Thomson, " Smithsolnialn Inst."). How was a pedigree kept elsewhere? In Tahitian, the word fetii, which means " to tie or bind," as well as " a bindin, or knot," means also " the relations of a person." Aufau is " the handle" of aii implement, and in Samoan, au is "(a stalk or handle." A4fau fetii is " the genealogy of a family," and must have been a staff bounid in some especial manner to serve the purpose of a pedigree-stick. Doubtless the long staves, sometimes covered with interlaced bands of party-coloured fibres, sometimes bound with discontinuous ligatures, alnd often sacred to some deity, were genealogical claims to divine descent. Aufau atua is the genealog,y of the gods " (Davies, sub vocibus). Still following the linguistic method, we find that in Samoan y 2</page><page sequence="14">320 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian Ornacnent a AlHythography; the word gafa signifies " descendants, a pedigree," and gafoan means " to be notched " (Pratt). An undoubted pedigree-stick, in the British Museum, is figured in Plate 375 of the Partington- Heape Album, and in Roth's translation of Crozet's " Voyage to Tasmania," where it is described as " a staff recording the llistory of the Ngati-iRangi Tribe" of New Zealand (Fig. 1). Now the word nati, or ngati, means " tribe " in the sense of " descendants." We are told that " from Tama-te-ra sprang the tribe of Ngati-tama-te-ra" (Grev, p. 254). There can be little doubt that the words ngati, "a tribe," and nati, " a class," are connected with nati " to tie or bind with a cord." The bound pedigree-stick would thus be presumptively anterior to the carved pedigree-stick. Indeed, the staff in question, which can be no other than the genealogical tree of the Rangi Tribe, though carved in wood, is strongly suggestive of a staff bound with an interrupted succession of ligatures. Dr. Stolpe quotes Bastian as saying that such staves go by the name of hok-ka-poppa, or " one after the other"; and we see that the Ptangi pedigree-stick is crowned with the god-originator, whose hands of three fingers rest upon his abdomen, whilst there visibly buds off from him a series of eighteen projections, caused by the same number of niotches, which, to judge by the terminal symbol, stand for ancestry in the imale line. No doubt hokka-poppa is a corruption of whdka-paipa, " to place one uponl another, to record past events" (W. Williams). A similar stick is in the Auckland Museum (Fig. 2), and is described as "a genealogical stick; each notch signifies a generation." The larger human figure at one end indicates the god-orig,inator, and the smaller human figure at the other end indicates the chief who was the proud owner of this distinguished pedigree. A third example (Fig. 3) is from the Oxford Museum, but the carving of ancestor and descendant is unfinished. Sometimes all the ancestors are carefully wrought into the human shape, as in Ellis's illustration (I, 355), also figured by Dr. Stolpe; sometimes the form is not so distinct (Read, " Journ. Anthrop. Inst.," 1891, Plate XIII, Fig. H); sometimes it almost loses human similitude (ibid., Fig,. F) ; and sometimes this is lost altogether. In other cases a representationi of the human shape was probably never attempted, and the genealogy was indicated only by a series of rude joints (Fig. 4) (Williams, Edition 1838, p. 55), or of notches (Fig. 5) (Stolpe, Fig. 2), or of pits (Fig. 6) (Cook, Edition 1784, p. 89). In quite aniother class of examples the carving is highly elaborate, and successive generations are indicated by doublets and even by triplets, as if to claim descent not from one divine person only, but from 'two or three. Favourite diads were</page><page sequence="15">or, a Symnbolismis of Origin and Descent. 321 Rtangi and Papa in New Zealand, Tiki and Hina, as well as Tiki and Tangaroa, in Tahiti, and Tane and Plongo in the Hervey Islands. Riongo's wife was Taka, and his daughter was Tavake, by whom he had a triple progeny, a triad called by I)r. Stolpe " three daughter-sonis," nam-nely Rangi, Mokoiro, and Akatauira (Gill's " Myths," p. 16). These, as a trinity, wvent, in the Hervey Islands, by the single name Tebuakina, and were carved upon a siingle idol, which was " a principal deity " (Ellis 1, 355, Fig. 3). From this triad were descended the original tribes that peopled Mangaia, namuely, Matoetoea, Ngak6, and Akuru (Gill's " Myths," p. 283). The name Tebuakina is doubt- less froi puali "to speak," passive formii pmakina, and mneans "that which is spoken to." In many cases we are not left in doubt as to whether the pedigree-stick is a mark of descent througlh a line of male ancestors or through a female lineage. The sign of the former is a phallic symbol attached merely as a determinative acljunct. In a staff figured by Dr. Stolpe (Fig. 49), the god-originator, probably Tangaroa, gives issue, by gemmation, to the second in the series, presumably a female, and she gives birth to a male, and the succession is continued in a row of alternate miiales and females; but that it is a masculine lineage is slhown by the phallic symbol that projects from beneath tbe chin of every second individual on this genealogical tree (Fig. 7). In an example from the Copenhagen Museum (Fig. 8) the pedigree-stick has its phallic determinative at one end; then comes the head of the proprietary chief who visibly buds off from his divine ancestors; and then follows a succession of generations, indicated by triads, until the god-originator is reached at the other end of the staff. Unfortunately, both this example and that previously mentioned are brokeni; but a perfect onie, similar to that of Copenhagen, is in the Oxford Museum (Fig. 9). A third variety of the masculine pedigree-stick is described ljy Williams (p. 98) thus: "The smallest of these idols is about 5 yards in length. Each of them is composed of a piece of iron-wood about 4 inches in diameter, carved with rude imita- tions of the human head at one eind, and with an obscene figure at the other, wrapped round with inative cloth until it becomes 2 or 3 yards in circumference" (Fig. 10). Dr. Stolpe gives a cut of a Rarotongani example in the Bale Museum. They are all remarkable in this, that the row of smaller hunman heads by which generations are indicated appears only in those terminal portionis of the stick that are uncovered by tapa wrappings. Where these enfold and conceal it, the sculptured genealogical lilnks are not continued, though the</page><page sequence="16">322 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian Ornamnent a fythog'raphy; tapa is arranged so as to suggest their presence. It was clearly unnecessary for the priestly artificer to be at the pains of carving fioures that could not be seen; it was eniough that everybody would understand them to be there. To take the next step in the argument, to show the existence of pedigree-sticks that record a female lineage, is to approach the subject on which Dr. Stolpe has thrown so miiuch light. He has proved what was before only surmised, that a design generally known as the K-pattern, sometimes interrupted, but usually continuous, is in reality a string of human figures, the two horizon zigzags being limbs, and the vertical bars that joiil them being bodies (Fig. 11). These figures, which almost cover the handle of a Mangaian paddle or axe, are obviously related to the female forms that are carved on the terminal of its shaft, and are morphologically derived from them by a process of evolution or rather of degradation, which has passed through an intermediate stage in which the limbs are represented, not as rectilinear zigzags, but as curvilinear semilunes. It is abundantly certain that the forms that crown the shaft are those of women, for they are invariably distinguished by pendent-pointed breasts (Figs. 12, 13). The solitary exception that Dr. Stolpe has been able to find is one in appearance only, for in his Fig. 23 the breasts are really fused into a single cone, exactly as are the legys in his Fig. 24. Both of these carvings belong, one on either side, to the knob or terminal of a paddle-shaft on which are also found, in their typical completeness, those female forms from whichl are derived the whole series of the so-called ornamentation. And one feature, well-nigh invariable in these uppermost representations that dominate as it were all the others, shall be mentioned in Dr. Stolpe's own words: " The ridge which runs straight down from the trunk to the base-line, and on which the crouched figure appears to rest, I suppose to be only a continuation of the back-ridge which is itself produced by a cutting, away of the material on either side. The formation may be due to a design to fill the empty space. Why, in a few instances, it divides itself into two or three points, I cannot explain with certainty" (pp. 219, 220). That it sometimes divides itself into two or three points (Fig. 13) shows it to be more than a meaningless continiuiationi of the back-ridge; and to suppose it to be nmerely an attempt to fill a blank space, is to ignore the laws of evolution on which rests the whole of Dr. Stolpe's charming essay. It exists, moreover, in elaborate New Zealand figures which are wvrought in a different nmanner from the Mangaian carvings (Martin's photo- graphs, 4B).</page><page sequence="17">o0r, ca Syimbolism of Oriqin and -Descent. 323 It is now contended that the formation is a sign of genietic descent along the female line. It is the birth symbol, the artery of life, the umbilical cord; and its bisection is to be explaiined by certain curious Polynesian customs. Williams says (p. 466) " Many mothers dedicate their children to a deity, but princi- pally to Hiro, the god of thieves, and to Oro, the god of war. If to the former, the mother went to thle miarae while pregnant; if to the latter, she went after the child was born." Grey says (p. 87) " The brother and sister [leaving the husband behind] departed together with th-e [newly-born] infant, carrying with them the placenta to bury it with the usual rites." "Wlen a child was born," says Gill (" Myths," p. 36), " the part of the navel-string niearest the infant was secured with a bit of tapa, and then the cord itself was longitudinally dividea with a bamboo knife. The dark coagulated blood was ther carefully washed out with water and the name of the child's god declared, it having been previously settled by the parents whether the infant should belong to the mother's tribe or to the father's. The bamboo knife would be taken to the marae of the god specified and thrown on the ground to rot." "At Rarotonga " he continues (p. 37), " when a boy was born the navel-stringy was thus treated over a collection of spears, clubs, and sling-stones. On the birth of the first-born son of the reianing king Makea, a human victim was slain and the royal babe was placed on the dead body for the purpose of severing the navel-string." Gill further remarks (p. 38), "It is said, of an ill-natured person, 'The naine of an evil spirit was pronounced over thy severed navel-stringq." In this connection it may be mentioned that, in describing an early Cypriote statuette, MM. Perrot et Chipiez observes: " The hands are placed near the umbilicus, and this is much too high, and made too important, perhaps in allusion to birth, and to the independent life in a child" (II, 150, Fig. 99). Lastly Ellis records (I, 272) what throws a side light on female lineage in Polynesia, that in the marriage ceremony " on some occasions the female relatives cut their faces and brows with shark's teeth, receive the flowing blood on a piec3 of native cloth, and deposit this, sprinkled with the mingled blood of the mothers of the married pair, at the feet of the bride." There is additional proof that these carved shafts of sacred paddles and axes were pedigree-sticks in the name by which the figures upon them were known. Gill tells us (" Jottings," p. 223) they were called tiki tiyki tangata. Dr. Stolpe too hastily infers from this (p. 232) that " what the ornament is intended to represent is the image of Tiki-tiki-tangata, who is, most likely</page><page sequence="18">324 H. C, MARCuI.-Polynesiant Orn0ament a J[fythography; the Tiki who rules at the entrance of the underworld." But, in the first place, that especial Tiki was the first man and not a god-oriaiinator-Adam and not Yahveh. Next, it is probable that Taiigaroa anid Rongo had a vital basis, and were deified chieftains, whereas Tiki had only an eponyrnic origin. The name signifies a " fetched" soul, the spirit of a dead man; and this idea, projected backwards, reaches the spirit of the first man who died, and legends clustered round the conception. Further, if Tiki was the first who died, the frequentative or plural tiki tiki must mean spirits in succession, or " anlcestors." Lastly, in a Polynesian word compounded of two nouns, that which coni-es last has a secondary, explanatory, or adjectival force. For example, when a number of men were eiigaged in pe&lt;ggiingy a net, and were entalngled in it by a strataoem, and drowned in the sea, the place where the exploit occurred was called Kari-bi-tangata, or " humani net-sinkers " (Grey, pp. 258, 259; tari, weight; hi, fishing, Davies). The conclusion now drawn is that tiki-tiki-tangata were the multitudinous human links between the divine ancestor and the chief of the living tribe. But to what ancestry did these pedigrees of female lineage assert a claim ? From what goddesses was it the pride of Mangaians to be descended, unless from the mnother, the wife, and the daughter-wife of Ronao-fromn Tu-metua, Taka, and Tavake. In'Mangaia all the gods were called the children of Vatea, and of these Tane was one. His name indicates the generative principle in Nature, and the word is used to designate a husband, and even a iman who is betrothed. There seem to be variants of him, and he assumes many aspects. In New Zealand, Tane- mahutu separated Rangi from Papa and fixed the heavens in their place (Grey's " Myth.," pp. 4, 84); whilst in Mangaia there were Tane-papa-kai, " the food-storer," Tane Ngakiau " the valiant," and some others. He has various appellations such as eretue, fierce, and mata-ariki, royal-visaged. The tenth or last heaven, the abode of the highest gods, was called te rai haa- mama no Tiane, " Tane's opening in the sky." A pigeon was sacred to hiln, a linnet also, and a kingfislher. "We are all chosen birds, Messengers of Tane, to save you." (Gill's " Myths," p. 49.) The kaud or kingfisher is considered good eating by all the liatives except this tribe of Tane. "A kaud darted out of the bush and uttered its cry just over the head of Itieve, who said, 'Aye, Tane, it is thou who art warning me'" (Gill's " Jottings," p. 100). He had a large "'uiational temple" on Huahine. "The</page><page sequence="19">or, a Symbolisqm of Origin and Descent. 325 Tahitians addressed thleir petitions to Tane " (Cook, p. 102), and " Tupia prayed to him for a wind" (p. 106). He was the god of the Society Islands (p. 1657). In Mangaia he was especially the drum-god and the axe-god; lie presided over the erotic dance as well as over the war-dance. His fAte was held on the nioht of the 26th of each montlh. Wlhen the planet Venus rose, Tane opened his bright eye (Gill's "Myths," p. 50). But to understand fully the symbolism of this god, one mlust go into the details, or rather into the evolution, of his drulm and of his axe. Ellis tells us (I, 179) that in making cloth, a stout piece of wood resembling a beam, 20 or 30 feet long and fromii 6 to 9 inches broad, with a groove cut in the under side [no doubt for the purpose of makinig it steady] is placed oln the grouind. Across this the bark is laid and beaten with a heavy wooden mallet. Further (p. 184), "the piece of wood being hollow oln the under side every stroke produces a loud sound, and the noise occasioned by sixteen or twenty mallets goirng at the same time is almost deafening; though, heard at a distalice, the sound of cloth-beating is not disagreeable." Mimic cloth-boards were beaten at certain f6tes (Gill's Myths," p. 259). Cook tells us (p. 1393) of some musical inistruments of Hapaee (or Haapai), which were employed to accompanly sirnging anld dancilcg, that "the performers had each pieces of large bamnboo, frollm 3 to 6 feet in length, each played o01 by one manl, who held it almost vertically; the upper end whereof was open bmtt the other closed by one of the joints. They kept strikino the ground, though slowly, with the close enld, and thus pro- duced a variation in the notes according to the differelit lencgths of the instruments, but all were of the bass or hollow kiid, wbich was counteracted by a person who struck nimbly a piece of the sarne substalnce, split, and lying upon the ground, furnishing a tone as acute as the others were grave and solemin."' In Tong,a a similar performance was observed (ibid., p. 1416). At a singilng concert the natives used " three lolng anld two short bamboo instrunients with which they struck the ground enid- wise. There were two otlhers tllat lay side by side on the ground, one of which was partly split. On these a person con- tinued beating witb two sticks." The latter drum is what Ellis and Davies call ih7ara, and Gill 7clraara, "the awakener" ("Myths," p. 270), a term that is 11o doubt related to the verb ta and tata (= 7a) "to strikee" (D)avies), and " to beat with a stick as the native drum, or the mat, at a night danice" (l'ratt).</page><page sequence="20">326 H. C. MARCH.-Polynesian Ornament a Mythqograhy; Ellis says (I, 197) "the ihara was a noisy instrument. It was formed from the single joint of a large bamboo cane, cut off a short distance beyond the two ends or joints. In the centre a loing aperture was made from one joint towards the other. The ihaqa when used was placed horizontally on the ground and beaten with sticks. It was not used in their worship, but simply as an amusement; its sounds were harsh and discordant." Returning to Tonga, we find it recorded (Cook, p. 1419) that the drums used at dances - were cylindrical pieces of wood, from 2 to 4 feet in length, trunks of trees, some of theni twice as thick as an ordinary man, and some smaller. They are entirely hollow, but close at each end, and open onlly by a chink about 3 inches in breadth running nearly the length of the drum. By this opening the rest of the trunk is hollowed, which must be an operation of some difficulty. Having the chink turned towards them, the natives sit and beat vigorously upon it, with two cylindrical pieces of wood, as thick as the wrist, and about a foot in length, producing a powerful sound. They vary the strength and rate of their beatiiig, and likewise change the tones by beating towards the end or middle of the instrument. It is called Naffa." An instrument closely similar to this in dimensions is now shown by a diagram drawn to size. The Naffa is from 2 to 4 feet in length, and as thick as a man; this is 42 inches lonig and 121 inches in diameter. The chink of the Naffa is about 3 inches wide; this chink measures 2- inches. In both cases the mallet is a foot loDlg. But the drum here depicted is of extreme interest because it stands vertically on one end, whilst the other or upper end is crowned with the head of a god. It is in the Copenhagen Museum and is said to be from Java (Fig. 14). The suggestion is now made that from bamboo instruments, such as Cook describes, are descended not only the upright drum but also the Mangaian axe. The " large bamboo," held and used vertically, " the upper end open and the lower end closed by one of the joiints," had only to be covered with any membrane to become a pahu or pau; and it should be noted that pa'u meanis the skin of animals, the bark of trees " (Pratt). Moreover, some of the forms of the _pcth are strongly suggestive of a bamboo prototype; those, for example, figured by Cook (Edition 1790, p. 1535) as met with in Tahiti, or drawn in the Partington-Heape Albunm, Plates 15 and 16. Cook says (p. 96) "their drums are formed of a circular piece of wood, hollow at one end only. These are covered with the skin of a shark and beaten with the hand instead of with a stick." He calls this drum e panoo (p. 101), probably a misprint or mis-</page><page sequence="21">or, a Symbolisn of Origin anad Deocent. 327 writing for _pahoo. The " closed " portion, to which are fastened the cords of sinnet which tighten the membrane, seems to indicate the bamboo joint, and the openwork below appears to be an evolution of those tenon-like feet, or dentils, that often projected beyond the joints of the kactra or horizontal drum. It may be noticed in passing, that there are certain bamboo chunim boxes met with mostly on the Solomnon Islands, that look as if they had been made by artificers whose minds were dominated by the " drum skeuomorph," controlled, that is, by a tendency to produce as a functionless ornament what was always present to their senses in structural utility. The top and bottom of the box are closed by the bamboo joint, but beyond one end projects a hollow open structure identical in appearance with that beneath a pahu. In other boxes there is a similar motive, but it occurs only as a coloured design. Ellis says (I, 193) " the pahu was cut out of a solid piece of wood. The block was hollowed out from one end, remaining solid at the other, and having the top covered with a piece of shark's skin. The pahtn ra, or sacred drum, which was rntu or beaten with two heavy sticks on every occasion of extraordinary solemnity at the idol temple [on Tahiti] stood 8 feet high." "The thrilling sound of the large drum at midnight, indicating a human sacrifice, was imiost terrific. Every individual trembled with apprehension of being seized " (p. 195). Tane, as patron of the war-dance (Gill's " Myths," p. 259) was saluted with every kind of drum-like instrument. To quote Gill, who translates a drama (pp. 260-262): "Now for a war-dance as the pahu we lift aloft! Spirit-land is deeply stirred At the music of the kaara; Oroiti and Tane approach; Softly sounds the cloth-beating mallet over the sea, Beat away I Beat away! " But the drum was especially sacred to Tane as the generative principle, as Tane-metua, the male parent. As night drew on his festival began, and the god was invoked:- " 0 Tane-metus, rise from the Shades, Delay not in thy dance. O Tane, the fragrant pandanus on the beach is mine, Red berries adorn me, Abundance of fragrant leaves, Beauttiful sweet scented flowers, With garlands of myrtle for Tane's coming, And white pandanus blossoms." (Gill, pp. 219, &amp;c.) " What passes yonder at the margin of the sea ? The god reveals himself, now Tane stands revealed. What rapture pierces my body, Oh that it would endure like that of a dragoln-fly in the sun." (Ibid., p. 106.)</page><page sequence="22">828 H. C. MARCH. -Poly)icsian Oqnament CT Mythograpiby; "Beat Talie, the delightful! From the kaara his voice issues. So thrilling is Tane's voice The heaven itself is shaken; 0 Tane, thee will I beat." ([bid., p. 219.) It is evident from these Vigorous miietaphors, which are here rendered more literally than by Gill, that the drum was not only associated with a Tane cult in the erotic dance, but was regardecd as Tane's embodiment; when the drum was beaten, it was Tane that was struck, and from the kaara's fissure it was Tane's voice that issued, We find an interesting eponymic legend associated with the drum-god, with the drum-like noise of the waves-for the ocean was called the sea of Tane ("Myths," p. 18)-and with the masculine significance of his n,iinie. The titular god of Huahine had an only daughter who was unwedded, and no lover was to be found for her on her own land. Her parents, therefore, put her in a drum called Taihi (tai, the ocean) under the care of Tane, and sent her to sea in search of a husband (Davies, p. iv). The view is now advanced, first as regards the pahu, that the diiminutive figures of the humarl form, or of humarn heads which serve as cleats for fastening the sinnet stretchinlg-cords, represent consorts of the god Tane, and that the remaining ornanienit, the tiki tiki tangata, is the tribal pedigree, the claim to divine descent through a female line; and second, as regards the kaara,that at one stage of the drum7s evolution, but after it had passed from baimiboo to wood, the horizontal ilistrumenlt assumed the erect form, more appropriate to the god, and was then surmounted, as in the so- called Javan example, by Tane's head, which subsequently gave place to Tane's axe (Fig 15). A2 the cult differentiated, the symbolism differentiated too. Tane the drum-go(d was repre- sented by the pahu; a distinctive symbol was required for Tane the axe-god. It is remarkable that the typical Mangaian axe was exclu- sively associated with Tane mata arik-i, " Tane the royal-visaged," a niame, says Gill (" Myths," p. 274), " ideiitified with the clever Mangaian method of securino stone-axes to wooden handles " by m-ealis of shark's skin and sinnet. His teeth, we are further told (p. 263) were stained with his victim's blood; he was Tane k, ai aro, " Tane the man-eater " (kai food, aro a person: " Myths," m) 30'i "As if a conch-shell sounded Is the falling of the axe; Strike the head (of the sacrifice)." (p. 313.) "The wounded are slhrieking, But they wake only to be slain, For Tane has co)nquered." (p. 314.)</page><page sequence="23">or, a Synbholism oj Origin and Descent. 329 Both Tane and his wondrous axe were believed to have come from Tahiti. We read, "Here is Tane, the royal-visaged, The axe coveted bv the god Tinirau, The famed Tahitian axe To slay warriors lapped in sleep! (pp. 274, 275.) The name /ane mata arikci, Tane with the royal face, whose teeth were stained with blood, must assuredly have been bestowe(d when the sculptured head of the god surmounted the erect, kaara; and must have been retained when the bead had become an axe, the neck a shaft, and the drum-cylinder a hollow stand. Let us enumerate the features, the distinctive peculiarities, of the typical Mangaian axe (Fig. 15):- 1. The stone implement is bound to the wooden shaft exactly as in, the case of an ordinary axe (Fig. 15 a). 2. Nevertheless, the axe, as a whole, is functionless: what purports to be a handle is manifestly impracticable. 3. It is constructed so as to stand erect, stone implemenit uppermost. 4. The handle consists not of one but of three portions. 5. The uppermost portion is no longer than is necessary for the reception of the ligature which fastens on the stone imple- ment (Fig. 15 a-b). 6. The middle portion is always solid, always larger than the rudimentary shaft above, and smaller than the part beneath, anid is usually cylindrical (Fig. 15 b-c). 7. The lowest portion is always hollow, always the largest, and is usually polygronal (Fia. 15 c-e). 8. The juLnction of the two upper portions is abrupt (Fig. 15 b). 9. The junction of the two lower portions is marked by a square shoulder (Fig. 15 c). 10. At the lower end, and often at both ends, of the lowest portion, are nuimerous projections, dentils, or tenon-like feet (Fig. 15 e and d). 11. In this portion of the shaft, transverse closings or stops occur, that are not only functionless, but must have greatly added to the difficulty of hollowing it out (Fig. 15 c and d). 12. This hollow portion presents a number of openings, some- times square anid sometimes oblong, but always rectangular (Fig. 15 c and d). 13. The openingas have specific names. 14. The axe is identified with Tane matat ariki, Tane with the royal face, though no royal visage is now represented. 15. The entire shaft is generally covered, to the exclusion of all other forms of ornament, with the K-pattern, known by the lname of tiki-tiki-tangata.</page><page sequence="24">330 H. C. MARCH.-lPolynesitan Ornament a Mythbogqrap7hy; 16. By selection, it is possible to form a series of these typical Mangaian axes that, in the lowest portion, bears a striking resemblance to a selected series of samples of the pahu. 17. The stone implement is wrapped in shark's skin and is bound with sinnet in a manner said to be peculiar to Mangaia. The theory now advanced is capable of explaining all these remarkable features, and must hold the field till something better is propounded:- 1. The stone implement is securely fastened on because it represents the surviving portion of aln ordinary axe. 2. But the axe, as a whole, is functionless and impracticable, because what purports to be the haindle is a transformed 7kaara. 3. For the samne reason it can rest, when required, as the erect kaaia rested. 4. The handle consists of three portions, because it has descended from something that was niot a haindle. 5. The uppermost portion is as short as the turns of the ligature adniit, because it is the head of the axe that represents the head of the god. 6. The middle portion, being the neck of the god, is always solid, larger than the shaft above, smaller than the base below, and usually cylindrical. 7. The lowest portion is always hollow, because it is evolved from the wooden kaara, which was itself hollowed out on the pattern of the bamboo prototype. 8. The junction of thrie two upper portions is abrupt, because it is the spot where the head of the god was substituted by the head of his axe, in order to symbolise Tane the axe-god, as distinguished from Tane, the drum-god, who continued to be represented by the pahba, and the figures that adorn it. 9. The square shoulder at the junction of the two lower portions represents the upper surface of the erect kaara. 10. Tenon-like feet project from the lower end, and often from both enids, of the hollow portion, because they so projected originally from each end of the horizontal kaara of bamboo. Simiiilar projections survive in desigti at the base of the erect Javan kaara of wood. 11. The useless transverse closings represent the original bamboo joints as well as the solid ends of the wooden kaara. In spite of the fact that their presence increased the difficulty of hollowing out the shaft, they were reproduced in obedience to a well-recognised law. 12. The square and oblong rectangular openings have an analogous explanation. They indicate the original aperture, whether the slit in the bamboo, or the single or double chink</page><page sequence="25">or, a Symrbolism of Origin and Descent. 331 in the wooden kaara, through which the drum was excavated in order to secure its resonance. The great increase in the numnber of apertures, helped by rectangular designs on horizontal inistruments, took place as an evolution of ornanment that largely consists in a multiplication of functionless details. 13. As regards the specific names of the openings, we are tol(d by Gill (" Jotting,s," p. 223), that " the square holes are known as ai tuna, or eel-boringas," literally eel-eatings, a term which suggests the hollowing out of a tree-trunk to make the wooden kaara; and that "' the lateral [oblong] openings are naturally enough called kavava, or clefts.'" This expression, which Davies renders "a crack or split by the sun," clearly points to the original split bamboo. 14. Gill observes (" Jottings," p. 224) that " Tane mata ariki, Tane with the roval face, was enshrined in a sacred triple axe, which symbolised the three priestly fanmilies on the island of Mangraia." This axe was buried in a cave and has disappeared. Btut the statemlent reveals a time when Tane's stone axe had not banished the memory of Tane's royal head, and when Mangaian tribes claimed descent from the god himself. 15. The K-pattern which covers the shaft of the sacred Mangaian axe, is ani assertion of this claim, a Tanie pedigree, the tiki tiki tangata of the clan. "Awake Tane !" was the inivocation, "Awake uiiunnbered progeny of Tane! " (Ellis, I, 3-43). 16. When a structure is no longer functional, and yet is regarded with interest, the form in which it is reproduced is liable to changes that are unceasing, though the elements on which its primal function depended are well-nigh indestructible; and when a religious emblem has lost it original definiteness and yet retains a mystical meaning, the essentials of tlhe symbolism are almost as permalnent. One phase of the metamorphosis of the Mangraian axe has already been inelntioned, the great muiiiltiplication of the apertures in its hollow portion, the transformed kaara. It should be noticed further, that this portioni ofteln becomes pyramidal as if to increase the stability of its erect positioni. Moreover, it often spreads upwards to such an extent as to ernvelop and disauise the middle portion, but t,lhe solid neck ot the god still exists beneath the superficial open-work that overlaps it. Oni the otlher lhand, it often occur's that the hollow portioni gradually dwindles, whilst the middle and solid portion grows longer and slenderer, until the dimenisions of a practicable shaft are nearly attainied. Nevertheless, the g,elnealogical K-pattern continues to adorn it.</page><page sequence="26">332 Explancation of Plates. Perhaps the most remarkable mutation is that towards angularity. For, not only is the altered kaa'ra thus affected, the cylindrical neck itself in many instances becomes polygonal. But a like tendency is to be observed in the evolution of the lower portion, or stand, of the pahm. In order to increase its resonance, the pahm is raised either upon legs or upon a base in which perforations are so arranged as to give a semblance of legs. Straight lines joining such legs or perforations would describe a polygon, and would originate a movement from the circular form to the angular. This change would be arrested in the pahu, which is functionally a cylinder; but in the trans- formed kaara there would be no functional hindranice to such a movement when once begun; and that it began in the way conjectured is shown by the mutual resemblance that often exists in the lower portion of both structures. 17. Lastly, it is hardly too fanciful to surmise that the shark's skin, surrounding the stone implement fastened with sinnet lacings, which is a functional part of the pahz&amp;, was adopted for symnbolic reasons by priestlv artificers in " the clever Mangaian method" of axe-construction. And now, if any substantial acceptance is given to the viewvs here advanced, the dismal and confused phantasmagoria of savage art in the South Seas is at once resolved into digniity and order; and the broad conclusion can be reached that Polynesiall mythography is a vast symbolism of origin and descent, alnd that, breaking up under the influence of primitive struct-ure- -forms and linited by rude implements and intractable materials, it constitutes the only basis of distinctive Polynesian ornairment. P.S.-It ought not to be overlooked that the word tataut " to tattoo," means also " to mark or countl"; that iho is "to colme down, as fromn an eminence "; and that iho-tatau is " a reckon- ing, of descent, or genealogy." It has loncg been understood that tattoo markings are often of tribal sig,nificance. Explancatiom of Plates XX-XXIII. PLATE XX. Fig. 1.-" Staff of brown wood carved on both sides.
