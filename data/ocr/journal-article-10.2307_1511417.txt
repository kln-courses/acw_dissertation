<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Porch The Digital Watch: Tribal Bracelet of the Consumer Society The digital watch is a perfect example of the reductivist esthetic of modernism: We now look at the time instead of reading it. The early method, internalized in childhood, of reading the time from a clockface has been supplanted by a sidelong glance at a liquid- crystal display (L.C.D.). This economy of intellectually learned skills has come about with the change in technology, from flywheel to liquid-crystal microelectronics. Along with that change in technology has come a vastly higher level of timepiece accuracy and efficiency. Do we really need such split-second accu- racy in our daily activities? Or do we think so, simply because the technology makes it available and advertising tells us we do? Does the advent of the digital watch mean that unpunctuality has been abolished? Now that people have apparently infallible timekeeping machines on their wrists, are they somehow more scrupulous about keeping to life's schedules? The first wave of the new mode in timekeeping manifested itself in the early 1970s with the arrival of the light-up, light-emitting diode (L.E.D.) watch. If one wanted to read the time one had to press an uncomfortably small button, to make the time light up in miniature, neon-like numerals. With this kind of watch one could read the time at the bottom of a well, but virtually nowhere else. Liquid-crystal technology got around this by developing a perma- nent time read-out which used black digital numbers on a gray background. It was with the arrival of the L.C.D. watch that modern technology supplanted the idea of the wristwatch as jewelry and replaced it with the timepiece as functional instrument. The widespread ownership of digital watches and the tech- nology that created them are of cultural significance. Worn either as subliminal badges of efficiency, or as "tribal bracelets," digital watches seem to declare an unspoken allegiance to some sort of ethic of modernism. The old flywheel-movement watches were eminently more pleasing esthetically. They had an aural signature (ticking), required minor attention (winding), and were vaguely anthropomorphic (two hands on a clockface). The digital watch is a silent affair that requires no attention and has the visual appeal of an instrument more suited to the cockpit of a 747 than to some- thing for your wrist. Such watches are now, to paraphrase Le 46</page><page sequence="2">Corbusier's description of a house as "a machine for living in," merely machines for telling the time. And, like many other prod- ucts in our society, they now also carry many enticing and entirely irrelevant extras with which to titillate and amuse the potential buyer, for example, day, date, bleep alarm, musical alarm, "space- invader" game, calculator/file function, compass, and of course, jogging odometers. There are children growing up today who have never owned a watch that simply tells the time. I still miss the old Swiss timepiece that I stopped wearing when it became erratic (fatal in a consumer culture, as it spells superfluity for the object concerned), and I was too lazy to get it serviced. The trend was then fully underway for digital watches, so I thought it was a good opportunity to buy a new watch - a digital one. Who would have thought that I would miss the idiosyncracies of my old slim, 18-jewel Swiss timepiece? I was reminded of the late Charles Eames's lament over the advent of the styrofoam cup, how he missed the sensations of heat and cold that the new cup eliminated. As he perceptively pointed out, the "neu- tral" feel of the new material in the hand had a dulling effect (like the dentist's injection of novocaine into the gum), removing the tactile qualities of glass, china, or pottery. Of course, the plastic cup is both non-breakable and disposable, not to say inevitably cheaper. But for Eames, durability was also an infringement on sensation: The bounce of the plastic cup supplanted the heart- rending crack of china when dropped. I miss the old Swiss timepieces because they were not universal in appearance. They looked by turn expensive, macho, kitsch, or just plain cheap. What they almost never looked like were futuris- tic identification bracelets, imposed on us by an alien race who wanted cruelly to remind us with split-second accuracy just how much time humans really waste. If you are wearing a digital watch, can you remember exactly how you came by it? Was it an expensive birthday or Christmas present? A cheap holiday impulse buy? Or was it simply that you found it impossible to buy anything else? Perhaps we are all striv- ing subconsciously to subscribe to the latest technological advances, and the arrival of the digital watch dovetailed nicely with acquisitive urges related to consumerism. In his book Design for the Real World, Victor Papanek pointed out that the "Reynolds Pen" (the world's first ball-point pen in 1945) was emblematic of a commitment to a product-future based on princi- ples of functionality and performance, rather than on any innate decorative appeal. In the digital watch, the modern world has found a product that signifies in its own machine-produced blandness, the world of mass-production, silent efficiency, "functional appeal," and uni- versality. Digital watches, chunky, rectangular, and unattractive, are neutral and depersonalized, and are always finished off in some Design Issues: Vol. II, No. 2 47</page><page sequence="3">sort of stainless steel case with matching strap. It is interesting to note that coating them in gold never seems to confer any greater sense of luxury or status on them, as it did with the flywheel model. (You know, like gold-plating a machine-gun - it's a bit pointless.) The all stainless-steel finish is entirely consistent with its function in product design, in the same way that the evocation of glass, concrete, and steel as "honest" and functionally appropri- ate materials are for their extensive use in modern architecture. It is in late twentieth century product design, with its emphasis on formal purity and form following function, that the early-modern notion of a machine esthetic has probably found the truest expres- sion of its ideal. Thus we have in products like the digital watch the promise of high levels of performance and no romantic notions of user appeal or tactile quality. At the turn of the century, Austrian architect Adolf Loos said in his influential book Ornament and Crime, "The evolution of cul- ture is synonymous with the disappearance of ornament from architecture." That book and its ideas had a seminal impact on esthetics in western culture. That book, and the people who built on its themes (those of the Bauhaus and niodern movements, for example), provided much of the moral and esthetic justification for everything we now see around us that is streamlined, smooth, reductivist, and starkly functional in visual impact - everything that is "modern." But, unlike the esthetic purists of the Bauhaus and their strictly limited production runs of tubular furniture, it was never likely that late twentieth century marketing people would be content with a product that simply out-performed the opposition techni- cally. In a uniquely modern way, their urge was to trivialize. Once the digital watch had captured the public's imagination and become a consumer icon, it was inevitable that the marketing people would want to reach as many user markets as demographi- cally possible. To achieve this they started to ornament the watches, not with superfluous decoration but with a host of largely useless extra functions. The question of whether the indi- vidual actually requires anything of a watch other than its capacity to give the time, date, and (arguably) an alarm signal, was never addressed. Victor Papanek had a picturesque way of describing this marketing process: "sexing the product up." The eighteenth- century French philosopher Rousseau would have appreciated the thinking behind this ornamentation. As he well knew, once the basic needs of the individual have been satisfied, a whole universe of fresh ones would be opened up, requiring further satisfaction. Perhaps I am too much a purist though, since digital watches are statistically more numerous than any other kind of timepiece; they must be what people want. People also seem to want the whole gamut of consumer gadgets, from "talking cars," with syn- thesized warning voices buried in the dashboard, to domestic 48</page><page sequence="4">robots, and, ultimately, powerful home computers of great capac- ity. Ironically, the latter development was largely underwritten by the sale of combat and fantasy video games, sold to the young and impressionable so they might live out absurd, vicarious fantasies (via high technology) that serve as an outlet for aggression, com- petitiveness, and thwarted achievement. The eventual outcome is a manufacturer's utopia, arrived at via a technologic-economic system advancing continuously on all fronts. The whole edifice is sustained by consumers who feel obliged to purchase, discard, and re-purchase all manner of mean- ingless products to define themselves as both individuals and peer group members; in other words, to be in on the latest trend you have to buy the lastest product. Individual product character counts for naught. How well does it perform? Better than last year's model? But above all, does it have a day, date, alarm, cal- culator function with a heart-rate analyzer built in? The human capacity to take highly complex technological advances and reduce them to banal, marketable consumer devices continues apace (encouraged by the economic system), and produces, as it does so efficiently, an apparently endless stream of high-tech pacifiers for an increasingly acquisitive and undiscriminating con- sumer audience. A backlash against modernism, which is what the digital watch symbolizes, has arisen in recent years. Postmodernism has had an impact in architecture through the work of the "born-again" mod- ernists, such as Philip Johnson (the AT&amp;T Building and others), Michael Graves (since 1974), and James Stirling (museum at Har- vard), on both sides of the Atlantic. It has also spread to product design, as seen in the subversive antics of the Italian avant-garde design groups Memphis and Studio Alchymia. Postmodernism still uses modern technology, but puts a witty "mannerist" face on it, acknowledging, often in a startling way, that our obsession with formal purism is only an optional, not a mandatory, esthetic. So let's have digital watches in baroque cases, classical housings, or, alternatively, in Dali-esque, formless pouches. Better still, how about a digital watch whose read-out shows two liquid crys- tal "hands" circling 'round a dial covered with "digitized" Roman numerals and a synthesized "tick" instead of an alarm. In other words, use the technology to humanize, not de-humanize. Design Issues: Vol. II, No. 2 49</page></plain_text>
