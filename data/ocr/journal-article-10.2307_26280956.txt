It is a truism of the literary marketplace that short fiction does not sell, that a young Katherine Mansfield or Frank O'Connor who would be published and ac claimed had best learn to be spacious. Similar pressures impel critics to pad essays into tomes, as if stature were a matter of standing on one's books. "Spatial Form in Modern Literature" is a rare and legendary example of an essay whose prestige and influence have, since its publication in 1945, rivaled that of almost any other literary study in English. When he wrote it, at the prodding of Allen Tate, who placed it in The Southern Review, the first of several habitations during the essay's fugitive existence, Joseph Frank was an obscure, unaffiliated young scholar. Now Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Frank joins ten others in taking a backward glance at the implications and effects of some of the con cepts he was among the first to articulate, tersely, thirty-seven years ago. Jeffrey R. Smitten and Ann Daghistany have assembled a collection of nine essays to examine the contribution of that earlier essay to our understanding of narrative. Although not a Festschrift in the conventional sense of a collective tribute to the venerable Frank, and although some of the essayists are frankly at odds with some of his contentions, Spatial Form in Narrative nevertheless salutes "Spatial Form in Modern Literature'-' by engaging its ideas quite seriously. The editors RECENT BOOKS—MISCELLANEOUS 349</page><page sequence="2">have organized these responses to the 1945 article according to whether they em phasize the relationship between spatial form and language, narrative structure, reader perception, or twentieth-century theory. The volume concludes with a selec tive but generous bibliography, one which testifies to the fact that spatial form is not a clever though otiose invention but rather a central issue in modern aesthetics. If, as Eric S. Rabkin's essay insists, all reading is both diachronic and syn chronic, then the representation of narrative as a spatial entity whose elements are meant, in one way or another, to be experienced simultaneously is, of course, an illusion. Like "point of view," "stream of consciousness," or "art object," "spatial form" is a metaphor whose usefulness increases as we become aware of its heuristic nature. James M. Curtis appeals to Thomas Kuhn's celebrated ac count of the structure of scientific revolutions to argue that Joseph Frank's essay responded to a crisis in literary criticism. As late as 1945, criticism had not yet been able to describe satisfactorily the innovative prose fiction pioneered by the Modernist masters. Frank's concept of "spatial form" provided the paradigm shift necessary to overcome the conceptual impasse and to stimulate sensitive readings of texts from the twentieth century and earlier. Both David Mickelsen and Ivo Vidan provide taxonomies of the variety of spatial forms, further refinements of the eurekal awareness that enables us at last to read Joyce, Faulkner, and Djuna Barnes—the author whose subversion of chronology in Nightwood, like a grain of sand in an oyster, provoked Frank into developing his concept. During the past thirty-five years, Frank's essay has been assailed as "anti historical" and even "fascist." Implicitly and explicitly, the essays collected here effectively refute such charges. They demonstrate but do not exhaust the usefulness and resiliency of the concept of spatial form not merely for the study of Modern ist narratives but for general aesthetics as well. It provides a clear focus for ex amination of the illusions of space and time, of the relationship between speech and writing, and of the nature of the experience we undergo when we read a text, whether a poem, a painting, or a film. The essays which Robert Con Davis assembles in The Fictional Father take their initiative not from a single article published thirty-five years ago but from a corpus of forbidding essays by a contemporary French psychoanalyst more revered them read. (John T. Irwin's "The Dead Father in Faulkner" is in reality an ex cerpt from his widely praised 1976 book, Doubling and Incest/Repetition and Revenge.) Davis and the five other critics, French and American, are performing an act of mediation between the theories of Jacques Lacan and the Anglo-American novel and between contemporary French psychoanalytic thought and the American reader. Essentiell to the Lacanian method and to these applications of it to works by Dickens, Melville, Joyce, Faulkner, and Barthelme is the figure of the father. In an in troduction which illustrates the approach by analyzing a text where paternity is certainly seminal, The Odyssey, Davis terms the entire enterprise "a psychoanalytic anthropomorphism of the text." It proceeds from the premise that the question of the father is one of his absence, that each of his manifestations is a recovery of the absent father, and that his "origin is to be found in the trace of his absence." The editor is concerned to distinguish this French Freud from the Viennese one and the old psychoanalytic criticism, which he characterizes as largely taxonomic, from the new—"a sophisticated confrontation with narrative structure as a com 350 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">plex of (ultimately) indeterminate elements constituted on many levels of textuality." The essays in The Fictional Father cannot be faulted for the willful obscuran tism and hermeticism for which common-sense champions like Denis Donoghue and Gerald Graff indict so much recent Continentally inspired criticism. The sentences parse admirably. And it is not necessary to read The Fictional Father beside the OED (though a Lacanian might, with characteristic analytic wit, point out that Oed is a moiety of Oedipe, the primal situation generating all language). But much of what is written here, in vatic style, is not so much an attempt at rigorous persuasion as incantation. Consider, for example, the veritably Gnostic rhapsody into which Thomas A. Hanzo's discussion of Bleak House leads him: "The other is the term which separates the self from object, and in language this term becomes that Other from which language issues." Or the sententious play of André Bleikasten in declaring, apropos of Faulkner, that: "Fatherlessness is not so much the absence of a relationship as a relationship to absence." What nettles is certainly not rococo syntax or even a private jargon so much as a haunt ing doubt over whether the hermeneutic benefit of Lacanian translation is com mensurate with the strenuous gymnastics it requires. Studies of mothers and daughters proliferate, yet these six men presenting their Lacanian readings insist on seeing the father as the central issue in literary criticism. Robert Con Davis acknowledges the discomfort that feminists and Marx ists might have over his approach, but he does little to dispel or even assuage such discomfort. Instead, he imagines an ideal reader receptive to a plurality of approaches. Inspired by the protean vitality of the Lacanian method, he has pro vided him or her with vivid demonstrations of one of them. A Lacanian essayist might be tempted to patronize such a book as the one Alexander Welsh has written. Like Miguel de Unamuno, as well as Harry Levin, Marthe Robert, René Girard, and Robert Alter, Welsh provides yet another set of meditations on the papa grande of all novels, one that becomes a rich excursion into the history of ideas. Perhaps the lesson of Borges' Pierre Menard is not only the temptation for each novelist to rewrite Don Quixote, but for each critic to rethink it. Early in the book, Welsh acknowledges that his project might seem quaint (quixotic?) to modish deconstructionists but declares, neither ingenuously nor modestly, "The point is that we are not yet done reading naively the greatest of these novels." Reflections on the Hero as Quixote is sly and sage. It provides an informed discussion not only of Cervantes' fiction, but of such other texts as Joseph Andrews, Tristram Shandy, The Vicar of Wakefield, Pickwick Papers, The Newcomes, and The Idiot as well. It is not necessarily a disparagement of Welsh's nomadic reflections to state that they are resistant to linear synopsis. But central to his concerns is an ex amination, with a sidelong glance at John Rawls, Jeremy Bentham, and Aris totle, of theories of justice. In the quixotic hero engaged in a quest for justice, in the nature of activities inevitably marginal, Welsh traces the stages from knight errant to victim of injustice. He defines quixotic realism as an imperfect resistance to injustice and distinguishes quixotic narratives, which raise questions, from satires, which answer them. He portrays the nineteenth century, with its faith in history and its temptation toward teleology, as profoundly alien to the spirit of Quixote, who, in Welsh's view, subverts our trust in the stable universe posited by, for example, Scott and Hugo. RECENT BOOKS—MISCELLANEOUS 351</page><page sequence="4">Welsh has much to say about the varieties of practical jokes and the manner in which the quixotic hero, frustrated by circumstances, by contingencies he can not master, is linked with them. Because the quest for justice is always incomplete, Quixote is always a victim, in fact defines himself as such and intensifies the in justice by persisting in his adolescent quest. For Welsh, the reader of a novel is engaged in an activity analogous to that of its protagonist. And perhaps there is a reflexive note in Welsh's reflections on the provisionality of justice: Justice is something that knights errant try to restore when they can, but which never can be restored. Justice is a very foolish endeavor. But each protest against injustice is a defense of an individual being, and each endurance of an injustice proves the resilience of an in dividual. Thus the determination of an identity and a demand for justice are allied actions. Welsh asserts, in a different context, that "... there seems to be no end to the reflections of quixotic heroes in the modern world." No more than any other book, Reflections on the Hero as Quixote does not, cannot, do justice to its sub ject. Yet the persistent, perverse effort conveys the ludicrous wisdom of its in dividual limitations. STEVEN G. KELLMAN The University of Texas, San Antonio rrfr STEVEN G. KELLMAN</page></plain_text>
