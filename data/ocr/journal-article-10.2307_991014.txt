DOCTO PEREGRINO: ROMAN STUDIES IN HONOUR OF TORGIL MAGNUSON Suecoromana, Studia Artis Historia Instituti Romani Regni Sueciae, vol. 1, Rome: Istituto Svedese di studi classici, 1992, 296 pp., 104 illus. $50.00 (cloth). ISBN 91-7042-145-5. Torgil Magnuson, the doctus peregrinus of the title, is well known to architectural historians for his important studies of Re- naissance and Baroque architecture, most notably Studies in Roman Quattrocento Archi- tecture (Stockholm, 1958) and Rome in the Age ofBemini (Stockholm and Atlantic High- lands, N.J., 1982 and 1986). The present volume is an eclectic collection of thirteen essays, many by Magnuson's students and colleagues at the Swedish Institute in Rome, the first in a new series on art history to be published by that institute. I have restricted the comments that follow to the nine essays addressing architec- tural topics, which are presented in the chronological order of their subjects. Ru- dolf Zeitler inquires into the patronage of Renaissance central-plan churches, a sub- ject he considers to have been neglected by comparison to explorations of these build- ings' forms, authorship, and guiding hu- manistic principles. Focusing on a re- stricted group of four examples, he stresses the primary role of princely rulers, while acknowledging the impact of a complex web of local, institutional, and religious clients. Gotz Pochat examines the temporary stage set designed by Baldassare Peruzzi for a 1531 performance of Plautus's Bacchides. Peruzzi's two drawings in the Uffizi relating to this project, together with an unusually detailed contemporary description of the performance written by Marco Cademosto da Lodi, permit Pochat to advance a recon- struction of Peruzzi's scheme, which em- ployed converging wings similar to those Scamozzi added to the Teatro Olimpico. The author also presents convincing argu- ments for situating the temporary theater to the west of the Palazzo Cesarini, on the modem site of Largo Argentina. Barje Magnusson analyzes an unpub- lished architectural treatise by Giovanni Maggi (1566-1618), best known for his 376 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="2">1625 map of Rome. The treatise, recon- structed from manuscripts in the Vatican and the Royal Library in Stockholm, pro- vides valuable insights into architectural theory and practice in the first decade of the seventeenth century. The Stockholm manuscript, dated 1614 and emphasizing the five orders, mainly consists of drawings copied from Serlio, Vignola, and Palladio, but Maggi did expand his sources with less orthodox examples, notably the Ionic capi- tals on Michelangelo's Palazzo dei Conser- vatori, which he characterized as a "bellis- sima invenzione." Addressing more practical aspects of the profession, he in- cluded examples of renovation work and of buildings accommodated to irregular sites. Maggi's list of outstanding architects from antiquity to his own day is consistent with the views of Giacomo della Porta; indeed, Maggi considered della Porta to be the most recent representative and teacher of good architecture. Petru-Mircea Iliescu's article interprets Bernini's Sant'Andrea al Quirinale as a "Tempio dell'architettura," a concrete theo- retical demonstration paralleling Lomaz- zo's Idea del tempio della pittura (Milan, 1590). Bernini's predilection for oval ground plans and anthropomorphic proportions is well known, but the proposition that his con- stantly evolving design for Sant'Andrea was intended to be read as a summa of his architectural theory strains this reader's credulity. The author's superimposition of a human figure viewed from above onto the plan of Sant'Andrea (figure 11) and of Gianbatista Caporali's print (1536) of the Vitruvian man onto the facade elevation (figure 12) to illustrate Bernini's reevalua- tion of sixteenth-century architectural trea- tises is both misleading and unconvincing. G6ran Lindahl offers an interpretation of Bernini's architecture stressing its funda- mentally classical nature. Through compari- son with works by Michelangelo and Borro- mini, Lindahl identifies Bernini's unique fusion of classical architectural forms with sculpture expressing supernatural effects. He also contrasts what he sees as Bernini's ability to "speak directly, in vivid and com- prehensible terms" (176) with Borromini's hermetic use of emblems, and quotes Berni- ni's remarks to Freart de Chantelou that "Borromini sees what is extravagant ... the forms appear to have been based on the chimera" (166). In stating that Borromini had no followers in Rome (175ff), however, Lindahl overlooks the remarkable Borro- mini revival of the 1720s. Lindahl con- cludes with a critique of Paolo Portoghesi's interpretation, according to which Berni- ni's classicism is the foil to Borromini's heroic rebellion and innovation, arguing instead for a more positive assessment grounded in values appropriate to the sev- enteenth century, rather than those of the later twentieth. Gerhard Eimer considers the funeral apparatus for Queen Christina designed by Simon Felice Delino in 1689. A skilled engraver and pupil of Carlo Fontana, Delino was employed by the queen in the capacity of architect. An unfinished draw- ing by Delino in the collection of the Cas- tello Sforzesco in Milan depicts a pyramidal macchina funerale set within the apse of S. Maria in Vallicella. This extravagant design was never executed, and instead Delino designed the more subdued ephemeral setting for the queen's lying-in-state known from Nicolas Dorigny's print. A short time before the queen's death, on the occasion of her apparent recovery, Delino had also designed a temporary facade for S. Salva- tore in Lauro, which shares the motif of the phoenix with the Milan drawing. Allan Ellenius examines the theme of villeggia- tura in seventeenth-century Sweden, pri- marily through the medium of literary evo- cations of rural otium and publications celebrating grand country houses and their patrons. As in France and Italy in this period, in Sweden classical themes were woven into the gardens of great estates such as Jacobsdal, with its recreation of the myth of Perseus and Andromeda. Ellenius identifies a patriotic ideology underlying the layout of many of these gardens, which were intended to compete with those in foreign countries. Carl Nylander's article on the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, one of the earliest modern cemeteries in Europe, focuses on that hauntingly beautiful burial ground in the shadow of the Pyramid of Cestius. The cemetery probably originated in the 1720s on the initiative of James III, the Stuart "Old Pretender." Prior to this, Protestant burial had been restricted to the ground outside the Muro Torto, where prostitutes, suicides, and criminals were interred. Ny- lander uses what is known of the eighty- four people buried in the "Parte Antica" of the cemetery between its opening around 1720 and its closure in 1823 to provide a demographic overview of a century of life and death in Rome. Readers interested in a more ample treatment of the Protestant Cemetery should consult The Protestant Cem- etery in Rome: The "Parte Antica" (Rome, 1989), to which Nylander contributed. Borge Blome's article on town planning in postwar Italy focuses on the period lead- ing up to the Venice congress of 1964, which recommended the formation of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and promulgated docu- ments, including the Carta di Venezia, that continue to shape attitudes toward city planning and historic restoration. Blomr notes that Italian experts emerged as the undisputed leaders at this congress, and examines the debate over the planning, restoration, and extension of cities that positioned them to play such an influential role. In addition to the nine essays summa- rized above, four treat nonarchitectural sub- jects: Per Bjurstr6m writes on Queen Christina as a collector of work by contem- porary artists, Hans Brummer on Viktor Rydberg's study of Antinous, Lars Larsson on the seventeenth-century painter David Klicker, and Harold Olsen on a relief by Camillo Rusconi. A substantial majority of the essays concentrate on seventeenth- century Roman art and architecture, and the volume will be of greatest interest to specialists in this field. The range of papers, covering painting, sculpture, and architec- ture from the Renaissance through the twentieth century, represents a fitting trib- ute to the scholar whose teaching and publications they celebrate. -John Pinto Princeton University BOOKS 377</page></plain_text>
