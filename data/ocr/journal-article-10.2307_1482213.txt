Scene here identified as the Creation of Eve William Tronzo The Hildesheim Doors: An Iconographic Source and Its Implications* The bronze doors made for the church of St. Michael's between 1011-1015 are generally consi- dered to be the outstanding achievement of the Hildesheim workshop under the patronage of Bishop Bernward'. But because of the pecularities of their iconography and style the doors have al- ways seemed isolated from contemporary devel- opments2. One problem has been the identifica- tion of the first scene on the Old Testament side (fig. 1). The scene contains an unusual element in the orant figure on the right, for which no satisfac- tory explanation has yet been offered. In the fol- lowing note a solution to this problem is pro- posed. It involves a source which is of further interest though because it also sheds light on the style of the doors and their overall program. It was Franz Dibelius who, within the context of a comprehensive investigation of the sources em- ployed by the Hildesheim artist, identified the scene as the Creation of Adam3. Dibelius noted the close resemblance between the Genesis frontispiece of the Carolingian Bible now in S. Paolo fuori le mura in Rome and Hildesheim's Old Testament door and, ever since his publica- tion, scholars have agreed that this page or an- * This paper presents the substance of a talk delivered by the author at the Frick Symposium on the History of Art in 1977.

Hildesheim, Dom, Bronze doors from St. Michael's. Fall of Adam and Eve other from one of the related Touronian Bibles in London, Paris and Bamberg is the nearest approx- imation we have to the source the Ottonian artist must have used4. Since all four frontispieces begin with the Creation of Adam the first scene at Hil- desheim has often been taken to represent one or another moment of this event. Several points, however, raise some doubt as to the validity of Dibelius's theory. To begin with, none of the frontispieces contains the scenes from the story of Cain and Abel that are found on the door5. But more important are the discrepancies between the door and the Carolingian pages in the scenes both have in common. Not only do the Carolingian frontispieces fail to provide an adequate parallel in the Creation of Adam to the first scene at Hildesheim6, they also lack, in the subsequent scenes of the Old Testament se- quence, two elements found on the door: the dragon-like creature above Adam and below Eve in the Temptation and Fall and the Denial of Blame in the third and fourth registers respective- ly (figs. 2-3); and the angel in the Labor in the sixth register (fig. 4). It will be appropriate to be- gin with these two elements because they reveal a common source whose relationship to the doors has never been thoroughly investigated. The dragon-like creature occupies an unusual place in the sequence of the Fall on the door (figs. 2-3). As is customary, the Temptation is per- formed by the serpent who offers the fruit to Eve7. But the dragon, hovering in the tree beside Adam, is a witness to this action and in the following 4 On the relationship between the four frontispieces and the doors, see Kessler, 14ff. Kessler concludes that a Tournonian miniature, but not one of the known Bible frontispieces, served as a model for Hildesheim's Old Testament door. Carl Nordenfalk reopened the question of Touronian influence at Hildesheim from both an iconographic and textual point of view. His argument concerned the Bible made for Bernward in which he saw the reflection of an early Touronian issue that also must have served as the model used by the artist of the door; see Nor- denfalk, *Noch eine turonische Bilderbibel,v Fest- schrift Bernhard Bischoff, Stuttgart, 1971, 153ff., and, following Nordenfalk, Bauer, esp. 23. SLasko, 119; Wesenberg, 80. Nordenfalk, 161, cites the small small scene discovered by Kessler in the Grandval Bible as evidence of the existence of an illus- trated Cain and Abel story in the Touronian circle; see Kessler, *An unnoticed Scene in the Grandval Bible,v Cahiers Archbologiques, 18, 1967, 113ff. But because of the scene's minute size, Kessler's identifi- cation was only tentative as he himself stressed. On the Burial of Abel in the Bamberg Bible, see Kessler, op. cit. (supra n. 3), 25. 6 None of the Carolingian scenes contains the orant; the Bamberg and S. Paolo Bibles lack the angel, while the Grandval shows two angels; Adam sits upright on the ground in the Bamberg and stands in the Vivian. 7 Tschan, op. cit. (supra n. 3) 186ff.

Hildesheim, Dom, Bronze doors from St. Michael's. Labor of Adam and Eve scene of Reproval takes the place of the serpent at Eve's feet as the instigator of the first sin. The Bib- lical narrative contains no explanation for this phenomenon; it is, nonetheless, age-old. In an effort to make sense out of the Genesis story, Early Christian writers declared the fallen angel Satan the true mastermind of the Temptation and the serpent merely his agent'. In the words of Au- gustine: The serpent was called the most intelligent of all the beasts, that is, the most cunning, because of the cunning of the devil who plotted his tricks in him and through 359</page><page sequence="4">him... But a pen is called a liar because through it a liar acts mendaciously, which is just like calling this serpent a liar because the devil used him mendaciously like a pen. Both John Chrysostom and Basil, among others, offered this explanation in their writings and com- mentaries on Genesis1o. The first known representation of the idea, how- ever, is considerably later than the Early Christian period. It occurs in a miniature in the portion of the Bodleian Caedmon, an Anglo-Saxon Biblical paraphrase of the early eleventh century, known as Genesis B (fig. 5)". The miniature, shows a ser- vant of Satan emerging from the underworld be- low to assume the form of the serpent in the Temptation above. But perhaps more closely rela- ted to the representation at Hildesheim is the ver- sion shown in the early twelfth century Psalter of St. Albans (fig. 6)12. In the miniature of the Fall painted by the Alexis Master the serpent of the Temptation is shown disgorged from a devilish creature whose head, arms and wings resemble those of the beast at Hildesheim. As Otto Picht has pointed out, the Alexis Master borrowed freely from Anglo-Saxon sources and in this in- stance he may well have utilized a Biblical para- phrase like the Bodleian Caedmon13. A third ex- ample, though later still, also appears to be related to Anglo-Saxon precedent. The Temptation in Queen Mary's Psalter shows the traditional group of Adam, Eve and the serpent, but here surroun- ded by three devils, now fully anthropomorphi- zed, one of which directs Eve to the fruit14. The manuscript is dated to the beginning of the four- teenth century but part of it is known to have been copied from an Anglo-Saxon model of the ele- venth century15. The other examples of this motif are scattered and for the most part differ from the version shown on the Hildesheim door and in the English manuscripts in one important respect: the devil and the serpent are not shown together in the 16 same scene The scene on the sixth register of the door (fig. 4) resembles the labor of Adam and Eve in the S. Paolo Bible but for the addition of one element, the hovering angel who appears to engage Adam in conversation. Nor is this figure explained in the Biblical narrative, where the Labor is mentioned only in passing in the Creator's judgement upon Adam and Eve (Gen. 3: 17-19). The compact nar- rative of Genesis must have seemed unsatisfactory to the literal minded reader for there arose an apo- cryphal literature that told the story in greater de- tail. One account, the Vita Adae et Evae, includes a description of how Adam and Eve learned to work from the Archangel Michael after their ex- pulsion from Paradise17. op. cit. (supra n. 3), 18.

Fall of Adam and Eve 5. Oxford, Bodleian Library, Ms. Junius 11, p. 20. Fall of Adam and Eve Ultimately, the Hildesheim angel must go back to an apocryphal text like the Vita Adae, but there is good reason to believe that its immediate source was Anglo-Saxon in origin. While the instructing angel was often represented in Medieval art, it seems that there were three ways of portraying him: he could be shown giving Adam and Eve the tools of their Labor, as in the Winchester Psalter; or actually demonstrating how to work with these tools, as in the Psalter of St. Louis in Leyden; or merely speaking, as on the Hildesheim doors and in a Psalter now in the Library of St. John's Col- lege, Cambridge (fig. 7)1". Examples of this motif come from a number of different places, but only one country can lay claim to all three types - Eng- land - and, among these, to the earliest extant ex- ample of all.

Cambridge, St. John's College Library, Ms. K26, fol. 5r. Labor of Adam and Eve cribed in part to Aelfric, the Labor of Adam and Eve is illustrated with an accompanying angel who instructs Adam in tilling19. The likelihood of the derivation of these motifs from Anglo-Saxon sources is directly relevant to an interpretation of the first scene on the Old Tes- tament door at Hildesheiml'a. So far as I have been able to determine only two early Medieval representations of the Genesis story show in the same picture an act of creation similar to the one represented at Hildesheim together with a figure whose pose resembles that of our orant20. These examples illustrate not the Creation of Adam, but that of Eve, and do so in two episodes consisting of the Taking of the Rib and the Shaping of Eve. Their close relation to the relevant portion of the San Marco sequence suggests that they both de- rive from a sourve connected to the Cotton Gene- sis21. But it is only in the Bodleian Caedmon that all of the elements of the Hildesheim relief occur: the central group of the recumbent Adam and the Henri Omont, Psautier de S.

The angel guarding the gates of paradise in the Holkham Picture Bible seems to direct the La- bor of Adam and Eve as well; see W. O. Hassall, The Holkham Bible Picture Book, London, 1954, 64f., fol. 4v. In the dome of the Baptistry of Florence, the Creator also appears to engage the laboring Adam and Eve in conversation: see I mosaici del Battistero di Firenze, IV, Le storie della Genesi e di Giuseppe, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, Florence, n.d., pl. 7. 19 Dodwell and Clemoes, loc. cit. 19a An alternative explanation for the motifs is offered by Bauer, op. cit. (supra n. 3), 25. 20 The representations are found in the Bodleian Caed- mon (see Gollancz, op. cit. (supra n. 11), illus. 6 on p. 9) and the Velislaus Bible (see A. Matejcek, Velis- lavova Bible, Prague, 1926, fol. 3r). The miniature illustrating the Creation of Eve in the Chronicon Mundi, Vienna, Nat. Bibl. 2576, has a similar ar- rangement of figures but does not show Eve in the orant pose; see H. J. Hermann, Die illuminierten Handschriften und Inkunabeln der Nationalbiblio- thek in Wien, N.F.

(supra n. 3), fig. 13. The San Marco mosaic is closest to the miniature in the Vienna Chronicon Mundi because it too does not show Eve in an orant pose. Judging from the evi- dence of the mosaic it may be argued that Eve's orant pose in the Shaping was a later medieval interpola- tion into the Cotton Genesis iconography. Other- wise the only difference between the Velislaus Bible and the San Marco mosaic is the position of the Crea- tor in the Taking of the Rib. In the Caedmon minia- ture, the order of the San Marco sequence is exactly reversed, as if it were made as a mirror image, show- ing from left to right below the angels assembled in heaven, the standing figure of Eve, the Creator, the Creator removing the rib and the recumbent Adam. The orant gesture for Eve in the scene of her Crea- tion is common in Byzantine art; see Adolph Gold- schmidt and Kurt Weitzmann, Die Byzantinischen Elfenbeinskulpturen des X-XIII Jahrhunderts, I, Berlin, 1930, 48f., pl. 47a, no. 67; 49f., pl. 48a, no. 68; 50, pl. 50a, no. 69; 50, pl. 51, no. 70; 61, pl. 67, no. 115.

All of these elements also may easily be imagined as having been derived from a miniature like that in the Bodleian Caedmon22. The main group of the Creator and Adam in both representations is simi- lar. Although the Ottonian artist has neglected to show Adam's rib, he has copied the pose and the gesture of the cross-nimbed Anglo-Saxon Creator as he grasps Adam's shoulder and side. The orant in the relief is based on a figure of the newly crea- ted Eve like the one on the left of the miniature23. The Ottonian artist has preserved Eve's pose and her intent gaze as she is formed, but he has simpli- fied the scene by eliminating the second figure of the Creator. Finally, he has represented only one fluttering angel in the upper left corner of the re- lief, a motif hardly as elaborate as the Anglo- Saxon image of heavenly witnesses but illustrative nonetheless of the notion expressed in the Anglo- Saxon inscription, &gt;&gt;Here God's angels descended from heaven to paradise&lt;24 The first scene at Hildesheim may thus be identi- fied as the Creation of Eve showing both what was meant to be the Taking of the Rib and the newly formed Eve contemplating her Creator, a figure taken from the scene of the Shaping of Eve2s. With this identification, however, an additional pro- blem is raised. The Creation of Eve is not a natural starting point for the Genesis narrative since it oc- curs well along in the story, and no other early Medieval Genesis sequence begins with it. In giv- ing pride of place to this event, Bernward must have intended the Old Testament door to serve some purpose other than that of a mere pictorial summary of a text. But before this problem is con- sidered it will be useful to bring to a conclusion our investigation into sources. In one form or another all of the elements lacking in the Carolingian frontispieces were found in two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, the Aelfric Paraphrase and the Bodleian Caedmon. These connections raise the possibility that an Anglo-Saxon manu- script like the Aelfric or the Caedmon may have served as a model for Hildesheim's Old Testament iconography although it is also possible, indeed likely, that such a manuscript was only one of se- veral sources employed by the Ottonian artist.

Creation of Eve would be necessary to examine the manuscripts themselves more closely so as to determine whether or not they were based on a source that may have reached Hildesheim from some other point. But this problem is not easily dealt with and to do so here would take us far beyond the inten- 22 H. R. Broderick affirmed this observation, which I presented at the Frick in 1977, in his unpublished Ph. D. dissertation, *The Iconographic and Compo- sitional Sources of the Drawings in Oxford, Bod- leian Library MS Junius 11,&lt;&lt; Columbia University, 1978, 158ff. 23 Dibelius (op. cit. [supra n. 3], 6f.) and Wesenberg (op. cit. [supra n. 1], 70, n. 169) claim that the orant in the Creation is a male figure. But, to judge from the subsequent scenes on the door, this conclusion is unwarranted. 24 Gollancz, op. cit. (supra n. 11), xl. 25 One further detail supports this intepretation. Adam is often shown with his legs crossed, as on the door, in the Creation of Eve, but as far as I have been able to determine, never in the Creation of Adam; see, for instance, Kessler, op. cit. (supra n. 3), fig. 13 (San Marco) and fig. 14 (Millstatt Genesis). Tschan (op. cit. [supra n. 3], 183) also takes note of this detail. 363</page><page sequence="8">?~~r-rv~ ~.

First of all, both manuscripts contain illustra- tions of the story of Cain and Abel that bear at se- veral points close resemblances to the scenes shown in the last two registers of the Hildesheim door27. Thus Hildesheim's Sacrifice of Cain and Abel is portrayed with the hand of God in a fiery ring as in the Caedmon, and lacking the custo- mary altar as in the Aelfric28. The Ottonian relief of the Murder of Abel is also related to the Caed- mon manuscript in the pose of the figure of Cain and in the rough hewn appearance of his club29. The second consideration is stylistic. It was pri- marily for stylistic reasons that Hans Swarzenski connected the manuscripts of the Caedmon and the Aelfric with the doors citing resemblances of drapery and composition"3. Swarzenski argued that these similarities demonstrated the common parentage of all three monuments in Carolingian work in the Reims manner. But the resemblances i' . ' i ? . I !.

All three monuments show the same distinctive, intri- cately interwoven trees and asymmetrical archi- tectural forms31. Certain figures are closely related as well. The odd pose of the triumphant Christ in Hildesheim's &gt;&gt;Noli me tangere&lt;&lt; (fig. 9), for example, mirrors that of the Creator as he ex- pels Adam and Eve from paradise in the Aelfric Paraphrase (fig. 10)32. Such elongated and sinuous forms as the triumphant Christ bear, as has often been noted, little resemblance to the other pro- ducts of the Hildesheim workshop33; an insular source would readily account for them. The example of the &gt;&gt;Noli me tangere&lt;&lt; brings us to the third area to be considered, the New Testa- ment side of the doors. Obviously the source here could not have been a Biblical paraphrase like the Aelfric or the Caedmon, but this does not exclude the possibility that it may have come from Anglo- Saxon England34. Two rare elements of Hildes- heim's New Testament scenes give evidence to this effect for they are directly related to insular developments. The first is the palm the Annun- ciate Virgin holds in the lowest register on the right door35. The motif also appears on the cover of Bernward's Gospel Book but, as Robert Deshman has noted, it is otherwise extremely un- common in early Medieval art36. Deshman cites only two precedents for it, in the New Minster Charter of 966 and in the Grimbald Gospels of ca. 1000, both of which are Anglo-Saxon37. The se- cond element is the small devil shown whispering into Pilate's ear in the fifth register38. Among the examples of this motif known to me, two from England come closest to the portrayal on the door: the first occurs in the scene of the Flagella- tion in the Winchester Psalter and the second in the scene of Christ before Annas and Caiaphas in the Psalter of Robert of Lindeseye, Abbot of Pe- terborough from 1214-122239. Both of these ele- ments, the palm and the devil, therefore, suggest the possibility that Hildesheim's New Testament scenes also have roots in Anglo-Saxon England. Finally, certain circumstantial evidence supports this view. We know that there were contacts be- tween Hildesheim and England during Bern- ward's episcopacy. The artist of Bernward's Gos- pel Book, for example, made use of a type of as- cending Christ that was invented in England barely two decades earlier, and this borrowing, though the most prominent, is only one of several in the manuscript40. It is also known that Bern- ward himself possessed certain rare Scottish and Anglo-Saxon vessels41. Scattered traces of Anglo- Saxon influence plus Bernward's avowed interest in insular art make the possibility of an Anglo- Saxon manuscript with Genesis scenes reaching Hildesheim during Bernward's lifetime at least plausible. 31 Regarding foliage, compare the illustrations on fols. 3r and 36v of the Aelfric and pp. 9 and 36 of the Caedmon with the scenes of the Creation, Tempta- tion and Fall, Expulsion and &gt;Noli me tangere&lt;&lt; on the doors; see Wesenberg, op. cit. (supra n. 1), figs. 158, 160, 162, and 166. Similar architectural forms appear on fol. 22r (bottom) of the Aelfric, pp. 57 and 63 of the Caedmon and in Hildesheim's relief of the Adoration of the Magi; see Wesenberg, fig. 169. Furthermore, the oining of a door directly to a col- umn is a curious eature of the architecture in both Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and on the doors; see Gollancz, op. cit., illus. 22 on p. 46; Dodwell and Clemoes, op. cit., fol. 23r and Wesenberg, fig. 168. 32 Wesenberg, fig. 160; Dodwell and Clemoes, fol. 7.

Dedication miniature With these considerations in mind we may now return to the problem of the choice of the Crea- tion of Eve as the opening of the Old Testament sequence. Ernst Guldan has clarified the program of the Hildesheim doors by bringing them into re- lation with the pair of dedication miniatures in the Gospel Book Bernward presented to St. Michael's in 1015 (fig. 11)42. The relevant portion of the two miniatures shows the Virgin enthroned in an ar- cade flanked by doors that carry the following in- scription: &gt;The door of paradise, closed by the first Eve, has now been opened to all by the holy Virgin&lt;&lt;3. Medallions with a bust of the Virgin on the left and one of Eve on the right surmount the doors. Guldan concluded that the typological re- lationship between Eve and Mary on the painted doors of the miniature was one of the themes of the real doors of the church and cited as corrobor- ation the juxtaposition of the two women in a most conspicuous location, beside the lions' heads that carry the ring handles44. The two figures could not be brought into a more direct and mean- ingful confrontation. Each holds the son who is the presentiment of the death and the salvation with which the two sequences respectively are concluded. The choice of the Creation of Eve as the begin- ning of the Old Testament sequence offers unique confirmation of this hypothesis. But it also sug- gests that the typology of Eve and Mary was the major theme of the doors. It is now apparent that Eve was brought into a prominence fully equiva- lent to that of the Virgin from the beginning, not only in the sixth register. Guldan observed that the program of the Gospel Book and the doors was probably the contribution of Bernward him- self4s. But only after having focused to such an ex- tent on the doors' sources is it possible to under- stand the true subject of the first Old Testament scene on the doors and in so doing to grasp the close thematic bond between these two monu- ments. 42 Ernst Guldan, Eva und Maria, Graz-Cologne, 1966, 13ff. figs 1 and 2. 43 Ibid., 14. 44 Ibid., 19. 45 Ibid., 13.
