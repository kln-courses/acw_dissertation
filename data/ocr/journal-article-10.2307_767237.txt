<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eye of Sovereignty: Poetry and Vision in the Alhambra's Lindaraja Mirador* D. FAIRCHILD RUGGLES Ithaca, New York Abstract The Alhambra Palace in fourteenth-century Granada had an extraordinary number of windows, towers, and balconies that allowed the palace inhabitant to gaze to the city and landscape beyond the palace walls. In the Alhambra's Lindaraja Mirador, the poetry inscribed on the walls collaborated with architecture to place the sul- tan on a visual continuum that began with him and ended symbolically at the horizons of his kingdom. The device of a window framing a carefully constructed view of land- scape served to naturalize the implied association be- tween vision and possession, and between territory and authority. The framed view and the idea of inscribing poetry murally had prior histories in al-Andalus and the Islamic architecture of the east. But the Alhambra is ex- ceptional in that the poetry speaks in the first person, en- dowing architecture for the first time with its own voice. The Alhambra palace complex in fourteenth-century Granada is generally viewed by historians as the culmination of architectural ideas that originated four hundred years ear- lier in C6rdoba. However, in many respects it is unique. It is the only Islamic palatine complex in Spain to be preserved with whole edifices nearly intact, and it is the only surviving building to have been ornamented with an extensive program of inscribed verses that explain and expand upon the meaning of the architecture. Architectural epigraphy is by no means peculiar to Islam, but because in that context words were prized more than narrative figural imagery, and text and ab- breviated textual references (such as the beginning lines of a well known Quradnic verse standing for the whole) were used to convey meaning, any program of inscriptions in an Islamic building merits investigation. For an historian of visual cul- ture, the Alhambra offers the opportunity to examine word and image operating together in one major monument. More- over, for my own inquiry into the development of the archi- tecturally constructed view, the Alhambra offers a rare and valuable opportunity to study not only the view as an insti- tution but also its attached (fourteenth-century) meanings as interpreted by the poems enframing it. Most of the Alhambra palace complex that stands to- day was built by the Nasrid rulers of Granada between the years 634/1237 and 897/1492. It consists of several semi- independent palaces, of which one of the latest was the Lions Palace, built between 1370 and 1390 by Muhammad V (r. 755/ 1354-760/1359 and 763/1362-793/1391) (Fig. 1). At its cen- ter is a rectangular courtyard (28.5 m x 15.7 m) traversed by small water channels leading to a central fountain with twelve lions. The courtyard is enclosed by an arcade on a level slightly higher than the garden's intersecting, cross-axial paved paths. The quadrants thus formed are sunken a few centimeters below the level of the walkways today, but orig- inally they were 80 cm below the present level.1 Although disturbances of the soil made during architectural restorations in the late nineteenth century have precluded the possibility of excavating for botanical remains, a visitor in 1502 saw six large orange trees there.2 Kiosks project at the east and west ends of the courtyard. The slender columns, in groups of one, two, three, and four support the attenuated arches of the gallery and the kiosks and diminish the apparent mass of the architecture, also dis- guising the distinction between interior and exterior spaces so that architecture and garden appear interpenetrating and visually continuous (Fig. 2). The intricately carved stucco on the walls contributes to this effect because the rhythmic lines and dense vegetal designs of the relief create sharp contrasts of light and dark that give the sense that the solid wall is a perforated screen. The multi-columned arcades do serve as screens dividing the airy garden from the surrounding halls and chambers, and in fact almost all the rooms in the Alham- bra mediate in some way between interior architecture and open-air gardens or landscape. In al-Andalus, palace archi- tecture from the tenth century onward often had such thresh- olds which defined, through differentiation, the viewer and the view, and by analogy, the king and his kingdom.3 On the Sabika Hill in Granada where the Nasrid dynasty built its complex of palaces in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, such liminal spaces occur in the Cuarto Dorado (Fig. 3), the Hall of the Ambassadors, the Lindaraja Mirador, and the Tower of Abi'l .Hajjaij (also known as the Torre de la Peinador de la Reina), all of which are indicated on the plan of the Alhambra's core buildings (Fig. 4), as well as the Torre de las Damas and the Torre del Mihrab in the Partal Palace, the more than a dozen towers built along the perimeter wall, and the Generalife Palace. The views are generally provided by salient miradors ("viewing places") with one or more win- dows looking out at the architectural and garden landscape well beyond the palace walls, so that the palace seems to ex- tend itself by means of the act of sight into Granada and the Nasrid kingdom. In the Lindaraja Mirador, poems inscribed on the walls draw attention to the view and define the posi- tion of the viewer. 180 GESTA XXXVI/2 @ The International Center of Medieval Art 1997</page><page sequence="2">:: SO ~ , ii iiii'ii. .............ii Mumi W m:iii-i al~i . . .. :--: UR -::....................... ............: . .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. ..

Granada, Alhambra, the Lindaraja Mirador (lithograph after drawing by Girault de Prangey, Monuments arabes et moresques de Cor- doue, Seville et Grenade [Paris, 1841], private collection). The Lindaraja Mirador is reached by passing from the north side of the Court of the Lions, through the Hall of the Two Sisters, and into a rectangular hall from which projects the small square chamber, which is the mirador (Fig. 4). The Lindaraja Mirador is on the same level as the Hall of the Two Sisters but, because of the uneven topography of the Alham- bra's site, it projects at a second-story level into the Lindaraja garden below. The mirador is a box with single windows on each side and a double, framed ajimez window in front (Fig. 6); above these, a row of stained glass windows admits a jewel- like radiance into the elegant chamber decorated with a color- fully tiled dado and ornately carved plasterwork. Formerly the mirador had a panoramic view of the exterior landscape that was only minimally obstructed by the Tower of Abi'l H1ajj j twenty meters to the north, but in the sixteenth century Charles V built up the walls, enclosing the garden and block- ing vision from the mirador.4 Today a combined section and elevation drawing, rather than photographs, gives a sense of the original views (Fig. 5). Such views, plentiful at the Alhambra, were generally seen from miradors located on the perimeter walls. In con- trast, because the Court of the Lions is not perched on the edge of the complex but stands well inside, the view from the mirador across the Lindaraja garden and extending beyond the walls of the palace city to the Albaicin and distant moun- tains creates a dramatic and unexpected juncture of an inte- rior, enclosed space with the exterior landscape. The view was precisely constructed to connect the Court of the Lions, which was the heart of the Lions Palace and the personal residence of the sultan, Muhammad V, with Granada in one visual trajectory. The Lindaraja Mirador thus binds interior and exterior spaces in the eyes of the beholder; and indeed the name Lindaraja means "the eye of the house of CA'isha" (the identity of cADisha is unknown). In Andalusian palaces the mirador not only provided a place for viewing, it demanded the very act of vision, simul- taneously defining one place as that of the subject/viewer and another (beyond the mirador's frame) as the position of the object.5 The mirador was thus a frame that constructed a sub- ject-object relationship in which the one was mutually depen- dent upon the other. This frame was material, delimiting the scope of vision, as well as ideological, articulating positions of power or lack thereof. The object-the landscape or garden as viewed-was presented as the creation, and the subject- the viewer-as commander of the vista or, in effect, its cre- ator. In the frame of the mirador, landscape and gardens were doubly constructed as representations. First, the fact that living trees, shrubs, and plants were displayed made the entirety seem natural. Yet, if by "natural" we mean that which is untouched by human artifice, there was nothing natural about either the palace gardens or the landscape of working farms, buildings, and orchards around them.6 The gardens consisted of selected plants, such as the orange trees in the Court of the Lions, irrigated to survive the hot dry summers of al-Andalus and specially cultivated to yield unusually prolific amounts of flowers and fruit. Like- wise, the farms employed irrigation, scientific fertilization, grafting, and other techniques to produce crops that without intensive human cultivation would not flourish.7 Al-Andalus had experienced a profound agricultural transformation that peaked in the tenth century; its effects continued, despite changes in political governance, until the sixteenth century when the economy declined under Christian rule. The pleas- ing and carefully framed scene of productivity and order seemed God-given, as if this were the way al-Andalus was supposed to be under the correct and good stewardship of the king, his dynasty, and Islam. Thus human will was couched in terms of divine intention. Second, and equally important, these views of landscape were produced to be seen, and the mirador provided the frame that set them off for the viewer. The landscapes that had been 183</page><page sequence="5">........... _ ~-ii--i:-i iii--i---iii:-:: iii- :- -:_::::::i::::: iiiiiiii-ii~ii- iiiiiiii i iiiiii `m a liii,~-:i . ..fi l r::? b . . . . . . . . . . . .-:-- i~iii-:::::::_: : :---~:-~ ~:~~ FIGURE 7. Granada, Alhambra, view from below (lithograph after draw- ing by Girault de Prangey, private collection). created through determined agricultural endeavor were seen through windows that, positioned strategically within the royal palace, framed them as representations. The implication was that beyond the frame and the representation was a layer of the real that somehow preceded and validated the represen- tation.8 By "real" I mean a layer of the world unmarked by external references and interpretations; in this sense "real" relates to, but is not synonymous with, "natural" (the state of the world prior to or untouched by humans). That the "real" layer was authentic, in other words, that it could be dissoci- ated from semiotic systems of reference, was implicit in the act of representing it. Once this separation of layers was pro- posed, the physical landscape was collapsed upon the con- structed landscape of human desire. The subject looked at the landscape from a distance. The apparent separation between subject and object was impor- tant: if the object was a representation, then-according to a positivist understanding of mimesis-the subject necessarily stood outside and beyond that representation. He seemed to precede it as an author precedes the text and the artist pre- cedes the work of art: according to this system, the view be- gins with the viewer, and the frame's division of subject and object served to create a privileged place for him and even to legitimate it. On the other hand, if landscape was an unrefer- enced reality, then it would logically seem to have existed prior to the view constructed of it. But, as various contempo- rary theorists have shown, the act of making text or art is predicated on the prior existence of an institution to receive, recognize, and validate it.9 Therefore, at the Alhambra the sultan's priority as author (or patron) was an illusion manip- ulated to enhance his pivotal and unique position, and that illusion was made possible by a mere aperture in the wall.10 The perspective and respective power positions were very different when the positions of object and subject were re- versed. A nineteenth-century print shows how the individuals walking below the palace on the edge of town would have seen the towers and miradors: there is no frame to guide their vision and the Abl'l IHajjaij Tower and Torre de las Damas are stark and impenetrable (Fig. 7). The people, whether in the town or on the hillside, are themselves exposed and yet they see very little of the architecture and nothing of the life within the Nasrid court. To summarize the argument thus far: first, the gardens and landscape were botanically and architecturally constructed and marked by human presence. The idea that a distinction was possible between the natural and the humanly ordered was an imaginative conceptualization. Second, the mirador's frame defined these landscapes as spectacles and defined the viewer's role in regarding them. As we shall see, the relative positions of viewer, frame, and view were set forth not only by the architecture of the Lindaraja Mirador (and in miradors elsewhere in the Alhambra and earlier royal palaces) but by the poem inscribed in the mirador's frame. This fortunate and singular conjunction of framed image and text demonstrates that the architect, the poet, and above all the patron were aware of the power of the frame, its potential as a metaphor and even an instrument of sovereign rule. The positioning of the viewer with respect to the land- scape, or the sultan with respect to his kingdom, is explicitly revealed in the poems inscribed on the walls of the Lindaraja Mirador. In the frames surrounding the entrance and windows of the mirador, a poem describes its relation to the garden below, speaking in the first person: In this garden [rawda] I am an eye [Cain] filled with de- light and the pupil [insin] of this eye is, truly, our lord, Muhammad [V], praiseworthy for his bravery and gener- osity, with fame outstanding and virtue graceful; He is the full moon on the empire's horizons, his signs are lasting and his light brilliant. 184</page><page sequence="6">In his abode he is none other than the sun, the shade from which is beneficent. In me he looks from his califal throne toward the capital of his entire kingdom .... 11 The verses play with the word Cain, which has the dou- ble meaning of "eye" and "spring" (or "well"). When it first appears here, Cain seems to mean "spring," a reference per- haps to a garden fountain; but in its second appearance, cou- pled with insan ("pupil"), it means "eye." The poem presents the mirador as an eye which is identified with the sultan Muhammad V. As a transcultural metaphor of the body and its inhabitant, the eye is a synecdochic image of the self, the most powerful sign of subjectivity. The view of that sover- eign eye is of garden, city, kingdom, and horizon. The mira- dor positions the viewer and frames the view, thus establishing the structural relationship of subject and object. The poem confirms the mirador's positioning function so that the de- vice is played out in words as well as in the architecture; moreover, it makes the metaphor specific to Muhammad V and his capital. The Alhambra is a very unusual case for it is the only standing western Islamic palace accompanied by such a pro- gram of inscribed poems. There were precedents in the Is- lamic Mediterranean and Asia, but none of those palaces had epigraphy as extensive and varied as the Alhambra. For ex- ample, on the walls of the throne room in the Ghaznavid pal- ace at Lashkari Bazar (eleventh-twelfth century), verses from the QurDan (sura 27) related the story of the Queen of Sheba's visit to Solomon; and in the palace of Mascild III (r. 492/ 1099-508/1115) in Ghazni, fragments of Persian verses in monumental Kufic script lauded the rulers, referring to them in the third person.12 Between 1068 and 1080, the royally sponsored Qarakhanid caravanserai Ribat-i Malik near Ker- mine received a Persian inscription in simple Kufic over its entrance portal, which praised the building and its founder in rhymed verse.13 Seljuq palaces in Konya and Sivas in the early thirteenth century and the Ilkhanid palace at Takht-i Sulayman (1280s) had selections from the Persian epic Shdh- ndma inscribed on the walls.14 Even closer to the Andalusian orbit was the Ziza Palace (1166-1185) of Palermo, where a cursive Arabic inscription in stucco in the great hall on the ground floor contained verses that praised the building and addressed the reader as "you."'15 Finally, there are fragments of a floriated Kufic inscription on the walls of the Aljaferia in Zaragoza which have not been completely deciphered. Much of the epigraphy in these earlier palaces served to exalt the ruler and patron and demonstrates that there were models for the wall poetry in Granada. The Alhambra's inscriptions stand apart, however, because they are the only ones that cause the building to speak in the "I" voice. Although the anthropomorphizing of architecture was new, there are earlier examples of anthropomorphizing ob- t 2~c, II FIGURE 8. Valencia, Ayuntamiento, earthenware jar, 13th century (drawing: D. F. Ruggles). jects in al-Andalus. The device of boasting (fakhr) appeared frequently in Arabic rhetoric and often took the form of per- sonification (tashkhis) or anthropomorphism (tashbih).16 There are many objects from the first centuries of Islam with short salutatory inscriptions such as "blessings" or "everlasting life" that implicitly address a viewer or patron.17 More commonly, longer inscriptions refer to the object in the impersonal third person. For example, a number of the carved ivory containers made in the workshop at the palace-city Madinat al-ZahraD in the third quarter of the tenth century state, "This is what was made .. ." (hadhd md Cumila)a.s A more explicit form of personification is found on a finely carved, tenth-century ivory pyxis from Madinat al- ZahraD in the short poem encircling its lid, one line of which states: "I am a receptacle for musk, camphor and ambergris."'9 From the first half of the thirteenth century comes a painted earthenware jar (Fig. 8) with bands of sgraffito inscription that include the following: Behold excellence, for you see the results before your eyes. My mouth has an agreeable savor; it is devoid of defect; it is sublime. In me, by God's grace, is art made beauty...20 A late thirteenth-century ivory pyxis has an inscription en- circling its body that begins: "Truth is in me like something stored in a pyxis .. ."2 These objects and a multitude of others 185</page><page sequence="7">Aii iM, FIGURE 9. Granada, Alhambra, niche in the entrance to the Sala de la Barca (photo: D. F Ruggles). demonstrate that personification was common in Andalusian inscriptions in the tenth through thirteenth centuries.22 Eventually personifying inscriptions were applied also to architecture, as in the Alhambra. We do not know-and may never learn- if the Alhambra texts were an innovation; was this the first instance of architecture speaking for itself via poetic inscriptions, a collaboration of text and image? A likely early link between architecture and personifying po- etry is hinted at in a poem (risdla) written for the eleventh- century ruler of Seville. The poem consists of a seven-part dialogue between the ruler's Mubarak and Mukarram palaces in which each praises the beauty of its own architecture and gardens.23 In its own voice, the palace al-Mukarram praises the myrtles, palm trees, roses, narcissus, lilies, anemones, jas- mine, stock, and violets in its gardens, and al-Mubarak re- sponds with praise for its own intensely colored flowers. The one addresses the other: "They have told me that your com- plex encloses adornment on two facades, the tiers of which hold a hall between two pools, both of great beauty, and the gardens are limpid with branches that embrace each other like lovers."24 The poem was evidently written after the con- struction of the halls, since it describes them in detail. Strik- ing in this long poem is not the description of architecture and gardens-such descriptions abound in the geographies, chronicles, and poetry of the era-but the adoption of the first-person voice to do so. Unfortunately the eleventh-century palaces of Seville were almost entirely destroyed by the build- ings of Pedro I and his successors in the fourteenth century, leaving us without any way of knowing whether these un- usual verses were murally inscribed and returning us to the Alhambra to ponder the dizzying leap from descriptive to in- scriptive poetry that occurred there. In the fourteenth century, three poets decorated the walls and fountains of the Alhambra with verses written in stucco, marble, and wood. Ibn al-Jayydb (672/1274-749/1348), who served as vizier and secretary of state to the sultan Yiisuf I, wrote either ten or twelve mural poems. Ibn al-Khatib (713/ 1313-776/1375), his student and successor in the post of vi- zier to Yiisuf I and Muhammad V, best known for his his- torical and political commentaries, was the author of two surviving inscribed poems. His proteg6 and eventual rival for political advancement was Ibn Zamrak (733/1333-c. 795/ 1393), who wrote eight poems, many of them quite lengthy.25 The program as it now exists consists of thirty-one in- scriptions, some of them whole poems, others extracted in considerable length from even longer poems.26 Presumably a great many more poems were authored in the hopes of in- scription but did not receive that signal honor. For example, Ibn Zamrak said that he composed seventy-six qasidas (long odes) for his patron Muhammad V.27 Poets recited their works viva voce at court at literary gatherings, cyclically recurring feast days (such as CId al-Fitr) and special occasions such as weddings and circumcision ceremonies. If they were judged good enough, the poems would circulate, enjoy repeat per- formances and perhaps be immortalized in written form, ei- ther as a complete poetic cycle such as Ibn al-Khatib's Diwan or in the histories and biographical dictionaries written by contemporary scholars.28 One thing is clear from the content of the inscriptions at the Alhambra: some (and perhaps all) of them were written simultaneously with or even after the con- struction of the architecture. Inserted into the bands framing doors, windows, and niches, they substituted for, or perhaps literally erased the ubiquitous Nasrid motto, "There is no conqueror but God." The Alhambra's verses represent only a minute fraction of the entire body of poetry written for the Nasrid sover- eigns. Although we do not know if the Alhambra was the first building with monumental poetic wall inscriptions, we do know that it was not unique. Ibn Zamrak wrote that he authored many of the poems in the palaces and gardens of 186</page><page sequence="8">the Alhambra and at least two other Nasrid palaces.29 Ibn al- Khatib wrote epigraphic poems for a palace of his own in a village near Granada.30 These other buildings do not survive and we know little about them, but it is doubtful that any of them had as much poetry as the Alhambra, which was, after all, the royal seat. Indeed, the number thirty-one probably does not reflect the full complement of poems at the Al- hambra since some of them were surely obliterated by post- reconquest constructions, such as the palace of Charles V. Of the Alhambra's thirty-one poems, twenty-five refer di- rectly to the architecture on which they were written.31 Some are written in the impersonal voice of the third person, but eleven-one third of the total-employ the first-person voice in which the architecture seems spontaneously to speak.32 For example, running around the perimeter of the Hall of the Two Sisters, an excerpt from a longer qasida by Ibn Zamrak be- gins, "I am the garden which beauty adorns .. . ," and fram- ing a small niche in the entrance of the Sala de la Barca, one of Ibn al-Jayydb's poems begins, "I am a mihrab .. ." (Fig. 9).33 By accepting the anthropomorphizing device, the poem's reader agrees to suppress the ostensibly objective voice of the author-the living poet-and to pretend that it is the building itself that gives utterance. These inscriptions differ significantly from Qur'Dn ex- cerpts written on the walls of mosques such as sura 2, verse 286 which runs around the base of the dome in front of the mihrab in the Mosque of C6rdoba. The QurDan has a recog- nized divine authorship, and when the first-person plural "we" occurs, the reader knows that it is God who speaks, not the building. Poetic inscriptions also differ from the inscrip- tions celebrating the foundation of buildings, such as the his- torical notes accompanying Qur'anic verses in the frame and impost blocks of the C6rdoba mihrab (Fig. 10).34 These use the impersonal third-person voice to state the patron and date of a building on the facade or in a prominent place, thus pub- licly commemorating authorship for the present and future. Any inscription written directly on a building's wall has a privileged relationship to the building that is quite unlike that of a text written about but not directly on a building, such as a waqfiya (charter of endowment) or an historical description. But the poetic inscriptions in the Lindaraja Mirador are not simply attached to the architecture; they are the very voice of the building. The poems are unsigned. Although members of the court certainly knew the poet of the Lindaraja verses to be Ibn Zamrak, the inscriptions deny any author but the building it- self. The building addresses its readers naturally and with au- thority, its words enframing niches, similar to the placement of QurDanic text around mosque mihrabs. Yet while the po- ems appear to shift authorship and agency upon the building, ultimately both words and building seem authorless, appear- ing miraculously at the patron's behest so that agency is not so much negated as subsumed within the sultan's role as the supreme worldly patron.

Here and elsewhere in the Alhambra, themes of sover- eignty and victory are interwoven with the theme of the tri- umph of Islam, reminding the viewer constantly of the might and power of the Nasrid house. While the Nasrids were ultimately to succumb to the Christian reconquest in 1492, Muhammad V's long reign, particularly the thirty years after the interregnum, was a time of skillfully negotiated peace, strength, and prosperity, and the poems celebrate his military successes and role as protector of Islam on the Iberian pen- insula.35 The identity and status of the patron were clearly articulated in the Lindaraja Mirador but the identity of the audience was not, and thus the question of precisely who read these inscribed messages exalting the Nasrid sultan is hard to answer. In the large Hall of the Ambassadors in the Comares Palace, the sultan entertained important visitors and probably conducted diplomatic negotiations. The Lions Palace where the Lindaraja Mirador was located was a more private part of the palace complex, although it was by no means restricted to the immediate family of the sultan. Indeed, the modern concepts of public and private do not apply to the royal pal- ace or to the person of the sultan. Any space occupied by him 187</page><page sequence="9">was, by virtue of his presence, a "public" space.36 Scholars have speculated at length about the function of the various rooms in the Alhambra, but as there is no documentary infor- mation about who was entertained in which area of the pal- ace, or where the sultan slept and ate, or where his family resided, these speculations are only inferences from the or- ganization and chronology of the architecture and the poems displayed on its walls. A small chamber such as the Lindaraja Mirador could not have been used for large ceremonial re- ceptions, and its message was not broadcast to a public at large. However, it is entirely likely that it held smaller meet- ings, perhaps for especially sensitive political negotiations and decisions or for literary gatherings of learned scholars and poets. It is likely that it was visited by Muhammad V's coun- cilors and by the most erudite, privileged, and powerful mem- bers of Granadine society. That Muhammad V placed himself at the beginning of a visual trajectory that stretched from the Lindaraja Mirador to the horizons of his kingdom seems as natural as the view it- self, in which the frame's selection of a particular place and perspective seems inalienable from the object seen, the ar- chitect's intention masked by the apparent artlessness of the scene. The function of the poem's personification is the same as the frame: it belies the artificiality and vulnerability of the sultan's position as head of his diminished fourteenth-century kingdom, whose very existence rested on his ability to bar- gain for peace, and represents it as right and inevitable. The creation of a frame for viewing gardens and a fixed place for the sovereign viewer was not new but the culmination of ar- chitectural ideas that emerged several hundred years earlier in C6rdoba with precedents in Syria and Iraq. However, the inclusion of poetry to explain the view was an innovation that made possible an almost mystical conflation of individ- ual look (the view from the mirador) and all-seeing gaze (the light shed by the moon and sun in Ibn Zamrak's poem), in which the sultan was posited impossibly as the generator of both. There are no architectural treatises from al-Andalus that might elucidate the architect's intention and confirm the mean- ings suggested here; however, we may cautiously accept the poems in their stead. These epigraphic texts did not by them- selves endow the hall or the palace with meaning; if so, we would have to conclude that meaning was absent from all pal- aces lacking annotative inscriptions, which is patently unac- ceptable. Rather, the text of the Lindaraja Mirador directed the viewer to an aspect of meaning already inscribed in the architecture and recognized by the viewer. The viewers-a group in which you and I are included-are asked to accept that the author is the building itself, and the sovereign its natural, rather than designated, occupant. In this way, the mirador presents a circular and self-fulfilling system of signs in which the sovereign authority that engenders it is also its primary beneficiary, as it serves to legitimate him and his rule.

In Colonizing Egypt (Berkeley, 1988), 60, T. Mitchell discusses this with respect to vision and urban space. He refers to Derrida's discussion of the ontological relationship between "discourse and inscription" (J. Derrida, "The Double Session," in Dissemination, trans. B. Johnson [Chicago, 1981], 191); see also P. Brunette and D. Wills, "The Spatial Arts: An Interview with Jacques Derrida," in Deconstruction in the Visual Arts (Cambridge, 1994), 15-18.

The sultan's place was unique, for it was the prime viewing position with the greatest panoramic breadth and where the viewer himself was framed. Although any member of the court with access to the Lindaraja Mirador, or any other royally identified mirador, could temporarily in- sert him- or herself in that place, such occupation was temporary. The act of placing oneself there incurred knowledge of a transgressive sub- stitution. For the development of the theme of transgressive occupa- tion, see D. E Ruggles, "Humayun's Tomb and Garden: Typologies and 188</page><page sequence="10">Visual Order," in Gardens in the Time of the Great Muslim Empires (Muqarnas Supplements, VII), ed. A. Petruccioli (Leiden, 1997), 1-7. 11. Lines 2-6 of a poem probably of 12 lines originally (because of the deterioration of the wall and subsequent loss of parts of the inscrip- tion, scholars do not agree about the total number of lines). The Arabic text and two very different Spanish translations are to be found in E. Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes en los muros yfuentes de la Alham- bra (Madrid, 1985), 124-27, and E. Lafuente y Alcintara, Inscripciones drabes de Granada (Madrid, 1859), 138-41. The translation here is my own. 12. D.

The condition of the inscription is poor enough that there is some disagree- ment regarding the precise reading of the letters and words. 16. Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes, 42. 17. For examples, see E.

Peres, Es- plendor de al-Andalus (Madrid, 1983), 142-43, and R. Lled6 Carras- cosa, "Risala sobre los palacios abbadies de Sevilla de Abu Yacfar Ibn Ahmad de Denia: traducci6n y estudio," Sharq al-Andalus, III (1986), 191-200. 24. Lled6 Carrascosa, "Risala sobre los palacios," 194. 25. Ibn Jayyab (whose proper name was Abi'l Hasan CAli b. Muhammad al-Ans.ri) may also be the author of two other poems on the Alhambra walls, according to Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes, 31. For Ibn al- Khatib (also called Lisdn al-din), see M. J. Rubiera, "De nuevo sobre los poemas epigrificos de la Alhambra," Al-Andalus, XLI (1976), 207- 11, and Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes, 32-36; for Ibn Zamrak (Abu CAbd Allah Muhammad b. Yisuf Surayhi), see Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes, 36-39. Additionally, there are seven anonymous poems at the Alhambra and six others, the identity of whose author is debated. 26.

Pinckney Stetkevych's discussion of poetry and its role in late-tenth- century Hispano-Umayyad court politics and ideology applies here ("The Qasidah and the Poetics of Ceremony: Three 'Id Panegyrics to the Cordoban Caliphate," in Languages of Power in Islamic Spain, ed. R. Brann [Occasional Publications of the Department of Near Eastern Studies, Cornell University, No. 3][Ithaca, 1997], 1-48). She likens po- etic panegyrics to the European royal portraiture (such as Rubens's Maria de' Medici or Velizquez's Philip IV) in which the historic moment or person is transformed into the archetypal and heroic. 29.

The inscriptions on the impost and around the mihrab begin with verses from the Qur'an and conclude with the names of the patron, the director of construction, and other supervisors, and the date when the work was finished (E. Levi-Provenqal, Inscriptions arabes d'Espagne [Leiden, 1931], I, 12-16). 35. The poem running around the walls of the Court of the Myrtles in the Comares Palace refers directly to Muhammad V's victory at Algeciras in 770/1369 (Garcia G6mez, Poemas drabes, 39-41, 93-96). 36.
