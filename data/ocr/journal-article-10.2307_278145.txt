<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHAFT TOMBS OF WESTERN MEXICO: PROBLEMS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF RELIGIOUS FUNCTION IN NONHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS R. E. TAYLOR ABSTRACT The widely differing interpretations of the function of certain artifactual materials associated with the shaft- tomb complex of western Mexico are utilized to illus- trate certain problems in the analysis of nonhistoric ar- chaeological materials thought to be of religious signifi- cance. It is suggested that in the absence of some new model specifically designed to deal with the religious sub- system of nonhistoric societies and in the absence of in- terpretative data derived from relatively secure historical contexts, the only approach which seems justified, in light of our present level of knowledge, is to operate on the level of broad generalized statements of probability. W HILE western Mexico has long been re- garded as belonging to a western extension of the Mesoamerican culture area, until recently archaeological research in this region has been generally neglected. This is probably due to the fact that the area was considered as marginal and as lacking certain significant Mesoamerican diagnostics and the traditional and historical as- sociations which gave impetus to the early in- vestigations in the Basin of Mexico and in the southern and eastern areas of Mesoamerica (Ek- holm 1940: 320). One element within western Mexico, however, which quite early received considerable attention, was a unique mortuary complex which, with the possible exception of "L"-shaped graves reported by Bernal (1949) from Oaxaca, has no known parallels within the rest of Mesoamerica. This complex was repre- sented in the archaeological record by a series of variant types of deep shaft and chambered tombs, a series of figurines in a variety of sizes and styles, and a number of other types of burial offerings associated, or thought to be associated, with the burials contained in the tomb cham- bers. The most characteristic ceramics associated with the shaft-tomb tradition were large, hollow anthropomorphic and zoomorphic finely modeled figures - the most famous (from the collector's point of view) are the "Colima dogs," a pottery effigy which corresponds to the characteristics of a special breed of dog which was a source of meat for many areas of pre-Hispanic Mesoamer- ica (von Winning 1958: 153). Although long the subject of interest, any cul- turally meaningful analysis of the shaft-tomb complex has been confronted with a particularly vexing series of problems and unanswered ques. tions. On the most basic level of chronological placement, the assignment of the complex in time has, up until recently, been very uncertain. Estimates have ranged from the 2nd or 3rd cen- turies B.C. to the 13th century A.D. This uncer- tainty was in most part due to the fact that no excavation of an unlooted tomb in western Mex- ico has been published on, so far, by a trained archaeologist. This is in spite of the fact that the number of individual shaft tombs known from the core area of western Mexico numbers in the hundreds, and thousands of tomb figures are found in private and museum collections throughout the world. Materials associated, or thought to be associated, with the shaft-tomb tradition generally have been obtained with little, if any, evidence as to solid provenience or association. The published data concerning the tombs and their associated artifacts are of un- even quality, for the earliest concern was the interest aroused in the provenience of looted materials appearing in the antiquities market. Also, it has been only recently that a more ade- quate control of the evidence has been forth- coming, especially in the area of chronology. Due to the problematical nature of the evi- dence, it is thought appropriate, by way of in- troduction, to briefly discuss the nature and pres- ent status of the shaft-tomb evidence and to out- line the present data relating to the chronologi- cal position of the shaft-tomb complex, before attempting to discuss the possible religious as- pects of the shaft-tomb tradition. In conclusion will be a general discussion of some of the basic problems in the interpretation of religious func- tion of material contained in the nonhistoric archaeological residue. DESCRIPTIVE DATA A. General Characteristics The general architectural elements involved in the construction of a shaft tomb of the western Mexican type involves a vertical entrance shaft, generally rectangular in shape, which connects the ground surface to narrow horizontal tun- nel (s) leading to one or more roughly vaulted or spherical burial chambers of varying size.

Typology after Disselhoff (1932: 528). considerable variation in the layout of the tun- nels and chambers has been reported by investi- gators. Disselhoff (1932: 528) first described four tomb types for the Colima and immediately adjacent areas: (1) a square pit, (2) a bell- shaped variety, (3) a shaft and vaulted cham- ber, and (4) a shaft and double-vaulted type (Fig. lad). Corona Nufiez (1954) described three similar types from Nayarit: (1) a simple pit type, (2) a conical or bottle-shaped type, and (3) a shaft and chamber type. In the ab- sence of any precise chronological control, how- ever, there was and is some question as to the temporal and contextual relationship between the various types. The burial chamber and a considerable por- tion of the entrance shaft of a typical tomb are in most cases carved out of tepetate - a caliche- like, volcanic tuff material which underlies the topsoil or humus layers in most areas of western Mexico at depths ranging from a few centimeters to approximately two meters. Both the depth of the entrance shafts and the dimensions of the burial chambers proper also vary considerably. Some tomb chambers are barely large enough to hold a single burial with its accompanying offer- ings, while others may be as much as 6 m. wide and 5 m. deep, with a height of up to 2.5 m. The deepest entrance shaft noted in the literature is the 16-m. tomb at El Arenal, Jalisco (Corona Nunez 1955). The easternmost occurrence of the shaft-tomb tradition appears to be at El Openo, Michoacan (Noguera 1942: 574-86). The tombs there, however, deviate from the architectural norm in that the entrance tunnels descend at an angle rather than vertically (Figs. 2 and 3). One of the most widely known shaft tombs is the 16-m. three-chambered tomb at El Arenal (Fig. 3) near Etzatlan, Jalisco (Corona Nufiez 1955; Covarrubias 1957: 89). As part of his re- view of the archaeology of the Magdalena Lake Basin of Jalisco, Long (1966) described a series of tombs, one of which (San Sebastian) will be discussed in greater detail below. Additional descriptions of 3 tombs in the San Sebastian area, out of 21 tombs located in an area of roughly 100 sq. m., were also provided by Long (1966). Although all of these tombs had been looted, artifacts including complete hollow figurines were recovered. Knowledge of the occurrence of shaft tombs in other areas of western Mexico has resulted from surveys, excavations, and the recovery of ceramics associated with the shaft- tomb tradition by Gifford (1950) in the Ixtlan del Rio area, Nayarit, and by Corona Nunez (1954) for a number of sites in southern Nayarit. In Colima, shaft- and chamber-tomb materials are associated with Kelly's Las Ortices and Tux- cacuesco ceramic complexes (Kelly 1949: 39, 122, 195). Disselhoff's (1932) survey and collec- tion in the east-central portion of Colima and adjacent Jalisco and Michoacan located shaft tombs at six locations. For the purpose of providing a more complete description of the shaft-tomb tradition and the artifactual materials associated with it, two re- cently published accounts of shaft-tomb salvage- t}r0C --- Tomb T Tomb 3 Tomb 2 FIG. 2.

El Arenal, Jalisco. excavations will be discussed in greater detail: Tomb One at San Sebastian, Municipio of Etza- tlan, Jalisco (Long 1966), the account of which presents the most complete analysis of any shaft- tomb materials to date, and Tomb One at Las Cebollas, located near Tequitita, Nayarit (Furst 1966). B. San Sebastian, Jalisco Tomb One at San Sebastian, Jalisco (Fig. 4) was found just below the summit of a 3-m.-high artificial mound on an alluvial fan next to the hills which formed the western border of the southern half of the former fresh water La La- guna de Magdalena, Jalisco, and is an example of Disselhoff's Type 3 shaft tomb (Fig. ic). The tomb proper is a 3.25-m.-square, 1.75-m.-high, roughly vaulted chamber. The shaft leading to the tomb is 4.6 m. deep, of which 2.6 m. is excavated in tepetate, while the remainder was dug through the surface topsoil. The shaft was connected to the burial chamber by a 1.25-m.- long tunnel. The original excavation of the tomb had apparently been carried out with pointed stone picks since these reportedly had been found in tombs north of San Sebastian, and Long reports pick marks were clearly visible in the ceiling and wall of the tomb chamber. The tomb had originally been sealed by closing off the chamber entrance with large unworked stones and by filling the shaft with loose tepetate. On the basis of data obtained from informants and from a formal skeletal analysis, it was deter- mined that nine skeletons of both sexes and of various ages (five adult females from about 22 to about 38 years, and one male of about 41 years were identified) were laid out in extended supine position in a regular pattern with the heads extended toward the walls of the cham- ber. Two 6.5-month-old foetuses were also found. Beads and small shells were near the arms of the skeletons, and some had obsidian "'mirrors" on their chests. Large hollow clay figures, clay bowls, and boxes were distributed around the outside of the chamber, usually near the skulls. There was also a concentration of hollow figures and metates in the southwest comer. Small piles of bone fragments were in the northeast and northwest comers of the chamber (Long 1966; Long and Taylor 1966a). In all, 18 hollow clay figures were reported found in the tomb; of these, 17 were available for analysis. On the basis of stylistic variation, Long (1966) divided these hollow figurines into two types: San Sebastian Red and El Arenal Brown. A third type, Ameca Gray, known from the Arenal tombs already noted, was also present. According to Long (1966), the stylistic variations in the three figure types have chrono- logical significance and represent successive de- velopments in the rendering of the figures. San Sebastian Red probably belongs to the very gen- eral type described by Kirchhoff and called by him Los Desnudos (Kirchhoff 1946: 51-4). It is characterized most specifically by a medium- FIG. 4. San Sebastian, Tomb one. 162 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970 L a I</page><page sequence="4">MEXICO SHAFT TOMBS textured red paste which has been slipped red with black vertical stripes commonly painted on the upper torso; it also manifests both occi- pital and temporal head deformation. These San Sebastian Red figurines had been found previously at Ixtlan del Rio (Gifford 1950), and a variety of the type appeared at Corral Falso, Nayarit (Corona Nuinez 1954). Long's (1966) Ameca Gray very closely resembles the Ameca type described by Kelly (1948: 58-61) and is characterized by a fine-textured gray paste, large pellet applique eye, fillet applique mouth, and occipital head deformation. Both San Sebastian Red and Ameca Gray styles portray armor-clad and helmeted warriors. The El Arenal Brown is characterized by medium- to coarse-textured brown paste, slipped red, small pellet applique eyes, and fillet applique mouth, and it exhibits occipital head deformation. Armor-clad and helmeted warriors are absent. On the basis of a detailed analysis of the traits manifested by the figure types, such as items of dress, ornamentation, and objects carried, Long (1966) suggested that, if we assume that the figures are roughly representative of the people who made them, each type represents a distinc- tive population separated in time from the other two groups. The oldest population, represented, according to Long (1966), by the San Sebastian Red figures, emphasized sexual differentiation in hair style and dress. Both sexes practiced head deformation and painted or tattooed their face and body. The population was moderately so- cially stratified but was limited in the variety of its material culture. The Ameca Gray appears to represent an intermediate population between San Sebastian Red and El Arenal Brown since they combine features characteristic of both groups. The later ohase population, represented by the El Arenal Brown figurines, differed from the first in nearly every respect. Both sexes used similar hair styles. and ornamentation differed mainly in dress styles. Head deformation was practiced, but the manner of flattening differed. Both sexes also mainted and/or tattooed their face and body. Social stratification was some- what elaborated, and there was a greater variety of material items. Long (1966) suggested three possibilities as to the nature of the burial practices involved: (1) the contents of the tomb may represent a family burial resulting from some multiple misfortune; (2) the household members (wife or wives, con- cubines, servants, or slaves) accompanied the ! a HC1 . 4s FIG. 5. Las Cebollas, Jalisco. head of the family at the time of his death; or (3) tomb reuse by a group over a period of time. His own reconstruction follows the third sugges- tion that the tomb contained individuals and artifacts from four or five separate interments over a period of more than 200 years (Long 1966). C. Las Cebollas, Nayarit Tomb one at Las Cebollas (Fig. 5), in south- western Nayarit, represents the fourth (and most rare) type of tomb construction technique as described by Disselhoff (1932) for the western Mexican area - a shaft and with double-vaulted chambers. This tomb was salvage-excavated by Furst in the summer of 1965 and is located in the approximate center of a cemetery of shaft tombs-38 are known, due to looting activity - in the highest part of a gently sloping field ringed on three sides by low hills with rocky outcroppings. The burial chamber itself lies 6.14 m. below the soil surface, with a shaft depth of 5.26 m. A significant architectural feature noted during the salvage operation was that the shaft leading down to the chamber consisted of two parts: a wide circular upper entrance which was cut through the topsoil and clay to the upper level of the tepetate, with a retaining wall of unworked boulders; and the shaft itself rec- tangular in shape and considerably smaller, cut into the tepetate to the levels of the burial cham- bers. The general shape of the burial chambers themselves resembled a steep truncated 4-sided pyramid with a slightly vaulted roof. Both TAYLOR ] 163 I. .</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tunnel entrances were originally closed off from the shaft by flat stones, roughly rectangular in shape and placed vertically against the opening. In the burial chambers it was noted that the floor of both chambers was covered with a layer of soil, to a depth of approximately 60 cm., which covered the dead and all but the tallest ceramic figurines. On the basis of informants' data in conjunction with information gathered during the salvage operation, an attempt was made to ascertain the original provenience of the contents of the burial chambers. In the north chamber, probably at least nine skeletons were present, laid out side by side in a north-south direction with their heads toward the rear wall and feet toward the entry opening. In the southwest corner of the chamber a ce- ramic house-model of the general type familiar from Nayarit was reported to have originally stood. Also present were large figures of the so- called "Chinesca" style as well as a total of 125 conch shells decorated in a style, according to Furst, which was familiar from the early part of the Teotihuacafn sequence. All but five of the marine shells belong to a single species (Tubi- nella angulatus Solander, native to the Carib- bean). A number of other types of figures as well as decorated and utility ceramic ware were reported from the tomb (Furst 1966). In all, eight complete figurines and fragments of six others were found. Of the complete ex- amples, three are free-standing, solidly hand- modeled with trichrome painted decorations. A fourth free-standing figure resembles most strongly Kelly's Early Chametla (Kelly 1938) and Grosscup's Early Amapa (Grosscup 1961: 404) figurine styles. More than 25 flat circular discs of carved and polished slate (so-called "mirrors") encrusted with pyrite and drilled along the edges were also recovered; the largest measures 22 cm. in diameter, with an average thickness of 1.5 cm. Furst's (1966) chronological interpretation of his tomb materials differs sharply from that of Long (1966). Both Long and Furst recognize that a common characteristic of the Nayarit- Jalisco shaft tombs is that, in all of the docu- mented instances, each tomb contained ceramic obiects belonging to vastly different styles or stylistic traditions. Long (1966), as noted, in- terpreted the variations in his materials as indi- cating a series of interments lasting for more than three centuries. Furst (1966), on the other hand, while admitting that it is "tempting," as Kubler (1962: 382) and Long (1966) had done, to try to order the figurine types on an "evolu- tionary" basis, rejected this interpretation; he suggested that either "persons buried within these tombs brought into common archaeological context objects conforming to their own local traditions" (i.e., that the husband might be ac- companied by one kind of figurine, the wife or wives by another), or that the area within which the shaft tombs occur might have been suffi- ciently unified culturally and even politically so that there were pottery-making centers supply- ing the needs of a relatively large geographical region. Furst (1966) specifically rejects one of Long's (1966) criteria used for the chronological ordering of his major figurine type - the degree of manganese oxide patina as a function of length of burial. Furst argues that the degree of manganese oxidation seems to be a function not of length of burial but of the specific manganese content of the clays and slips used. D. Chronological Placement The problem of chronological placement of the shaft-tomb materials has, of course, occu- pied the attention of archaeologists and others since the original discoveries. Kelly (1938) placed the shaft-tomb materials of Colima into her Ortices phase - the earliest of her four re- gional ceramic complexes - on the basis of sur- face sherds from a supposed shaft-tomb associ- ation. The Ortices complex was provisionally correlated by Kelly (1949: 39, 195) with Teoti- huacain III, although more recent work by Kelly has somewhat modified her published conclu- sions (I. Kelly, personal communication), and additional evidence suggests the presence of Thin Orange in earlier phases at Teotihuacain. The advent of radiocarbon dating, however, and its recent application to materials associated with the shaft-tomb complex have provided much more secure chronological evidence. Eight radiocarbon dates associated with four shaft tombs have been or are about to be published, and the results are presented in Table I. Unfortunately, except for UCLA 966 and 1032, all of the radiocarbon determinations have been performed on marine-shell carbonate samples which have a greater degree of uncer- tainty concerning their validity due to (1) known attack of ground water on shell, (2) measurements yielding a nonuniform radiocar- bon content of contemporary shells due to up- welling conditions and (3) situations where 164 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="6">MEXICO SHAFT TOMBS TABLE 1.

Berger and Libby 1970 open-ocean situations were lacking. In an at- tempt to control the attack of ground water on the shell samples, at least 50% by weight of the shell surface was removed by hydrochloric acid to remove the possibility of surface contamina- tion. To control for possible variation in the initial C-14 activity of the marine shell samples, a series of contemporary marine shells from the western Mexican Pacific coast were collected and were analyzed for their C-14 content. It was determined that a -3.10?1.0% (or -240 ?80 years) deviation from the NBS standard was typical of western Mexican marine shells growing in open oceanic environments (Berger, Taylor, and Libby 1966). Utilizing these data, a correction of -3% was applied to the Pacific coast species of shells dated, and this value is utilized in the computation of the value for these shell samples under the column in Table I labeled "corrected date." No correction has been applied to the shell samples (UCLA 1012 and 593A) from Tequilita and to one of the San Sebastian determinations, due to the fact that these are Caribbean species and the oceano- graphic conditions off the east coast of Mexico are not securely known. Fortunately, however, the Mexican gulf coast appears to be not in an extreme upwelling environment. Both of the two radiocarbon determinations not based on marine-shell carbonate derive from San Sebastian. These samples have had their dates obtained on collagen obtained from hu- man bone recovered in the burial chamber dur- ing the salvage operations. The process of utiliz- ing bone collagen for radiocarbon dating has been discussed by Berger, Homey, and Libby (1964); it involves dissolving the bone's inor- ganic mineral fraction and dating the residual organic carbon from collagen. For those dates obtained on terrestrial material (bone, for ex- ample), recent data on the radiocarbon content of the biosphere (the DeVries effect) have been utilized to correct the C-14 values (Suess 1965). The dates listed under the column labeled "cor- rected date" for UCLA 966 and 1032 state the "probable historical date" in light of these data. It has already been noted here that the most thoroughly investigated shaft tomb is that of San Sebastian. A number of techniques were utilized in the chronological as well as in the cultural reconstruction of the tomb materials. The techniques involved osteological analysis, nitrogen and ultraviolet analysis of human bone, comparative stylistic and technical analysis of clay, shell, and stone artifacts, and hydration measurements of obsidian artifacts, as well as the radiocarbon dating of 'shell artifacts and human bone. The preliminary data on the dat- ing of the San Sebastian tomb were published initially by Furst (1965a), while a more compre- hensive discussion of the chronological problems was presented by Long and Taylor (1966a, 1966b). Paralleling the divergent interpretation of the chronology of the shaft-tomb materials on the basis of stylistic aspects, two interpretations of the purely chronological evidence have been generated. Long (1966) and Long and Taylor TAYLOR ] 165</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (1966a) conclude that the radiocarbon evidence suggests at least two successive periods of inter- ment, from the second century B.C., to the third to fourth centuries A.D. Furst (1966) explains the disparate figurine styles not on the basis of successive chronological placement but by assuming that these ceramics had been associated contemporaneously in the burial offerings. In fact, he questions as too early the third-century B.C. date (uncorrected for upwelling) on the basis that the shell sample as an ornament might have represented an hierloom passed on for an unknown number of generations until placed within a tomb context. Furst accepts a 140 B.C. date as more reasonable, noting that it corre- sponds rather well to the radiocarbon dating obtained from the lower levels at the Morett site on the Colima coast. Indeed, C. W. Meighan in his analysis of the Morett material has found a number of minor but nevertheless significant stylistic resemblances between Early Morett figures and the large hollow tomb figures of Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit (C. W. Meighan, personal communication). Radiocarbon dates, not available to Furst at his writing, very tenta- tively suggest that the bottom levels at Morett may well begin about the third century B.C. INTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS Because the problems inherent in drawing valid conclusions concerning religious beliefs and practices based on nonhistoric archaeologi- cal data are a function of available and clearly understood artifact assemblages, it would seem that any interpretative analysis of the religious content of material culture must proceed on a careful step-by-step evaluation of the archaeo- logical evidence. In the absence of a compre- hensive record, only general tentative suggestions can be expected as to possible religious meaning based on relevant ethnographic data related temporally and spatially and/or by a similar level of cultural complexity. When we turn to the task of interpreting the religious significance of the archaeological ma- terials derived from the western Mexican shaft- tomb tradition, the necessity for extreme caution seems quite evident. On the most elementary level, the link to the ethnographic and/or docu- mentary data is tenuous since the shaft-tomb tradition seems to have come to an end not later than the fifth century A.D.-- approximately a thousand years removed from the pertinent ethnographic sources. Even a brief review of the literature dealing with the shaft-tomb materials suggests that the process of careful, controlled comparison in the analysis of the religious func- tion of the tomb materials has, in most cases, not been followed. This is probably somewhat related to a point already emphasized - that up until recently nearly all aspects of the data on the shaft-tomb complex (specific provenience, construction detail and range of variation, tem- poral placement, etc.) were all very inadequately known. Thus "conjectural reconstruction" or speculation on the meaning of specific features was made on the basis of the most likely in- ferences. For example, the ceramic effigies of the fattened and edible dogs from Colima have been interpreted as guides of the dead across the ex- panse of water into the underworld, by analogy with late central Mexican religious concepts as reported by Sahagun, Motolinia, and others in the 16th century (Kubler 1962: 338, note 16; Toscana 1946: 24). For purposes of this paper, the suggestions as to the cultural function of the western Mexican shaft-tomb complex can broadly be divided into two polar orientations: (1) those which ap- proach the materials in terms of essentially non- religious symbolism, i.e., that the tomb figures are symbolic representations of selected aspects of day-to-day existence of the individuals buried in the tombs, and (2) those which view the tomb complex as reflecting some type of specific supernatural focus. The first approach to the tomb materials can be typified in a statement by Covarrubias (1957: 87) that western Mexi- can tomb sculpture is concerned with "minute and detailed representations of ... family life, occupations and ceremonies ... without trace of religious or symbolic concepts... ." In this view he is joined by Kirchhoff (1946: 68). The second attitude can be exemplified by the previous noted interpretation of the Colima dog figures. Animal figures viewed as "totemic" symbols also fall within this pattern (Toscano 1946: 25). A more extreme variant of this second approach can also be seen in Furst's (1966) interpretation of his Las Cebollas tomb materials in which far- ranging comparative ethnographic (Africa, Si- beria, Upper Paleolithic and Bronze Age western Europe, Ancient Near East, Classic Mediter- ranean, North American Indian) and psychia- tric data are brought together to interpret vari- ous elements, such as the figurines, in terms of assumed supernatural beliefs, viz., that they rep- 166 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="8">MEXICO SHAFT TOMBS resent "shamanistic guardians of the dead." It is further suggested that the . . . material remains of the shaft-tomb cultures suggest . . . this as the focus of magio-religious life: the reintegra- tion of man with his ancestors, through the mediation of the shaman (Furst 1966: 425-6; see also Furst 1965b). The contrasting interpretations which the shaft-tomb materials have generated point out most dramatically the need for caution and a critical approach to the total problem of infer- ence of religious content from archaeological context. Sears, in part based on Willey (1953: 380), has suggested that there are three cate- gories of analogy and inference based on these analogies which can be utilized for the interpre- tation of prehistoric data: (1) analogies drawn from tight historical context, i.e., documented historic sites, (2) analogies drawn from loose historical context, i.e., interpretation of south- eastern archaeology from southeastern ethnol- ogy, and (3) analogies drawn from general com- parative data, e.g., a sharply pointed stone is a spear point (Sears 1961: 226). In the absence of analogies in categories one and two in Sears' schema, it is suggested that the use of the third type of analogy requires that the inferences pro- ceed on a very "low" or generalized basis. Thus, purely on the basis of the total evidence avail- able to the prehistoric archaeologist, the infer- ences concerning religious content have built-in limits of credibility. The level of inference made by Long (1966) is more consistent with the ap- proach suggested here. He suggests (Long 1966: 103) that the religion represented by the shaft- tomb materials "was dominated by a somewhat elaborate cult of the dead" which was main- tained over a considerable range of time. He further suggests (Long 1966: 103) that these tombs were maintained by relatives after the inter- ment and were used for subsequent burial of other im- portant personages. Some form of ancestor worship must have been the basis for this important cultural focus. Any effort to define more closely the exact nature of the suggested ancestor cult flounders on the paucity and lack of specificity of our understanding of the archaeological data so far available. As a matter of fact, no local resi- dential areas associated with the shaft-tomb sites are known for this area of western Mexico. Thus we lack, for example, even such fundamental data as which of the decorated tomb ceramics occur also in a habitation context. Any attempt at more detailed explanation must await, at the very least, further controlled excavation and correlation of artifact assemblages obtained from habitation sites and tombs. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS The relative success which prehistorians have had over the last two or three decades in de- veloping techniques to deal with the purely descriptive and chronological aspects of their analysis is to be contrasted with the relatively meager development of rigorously defined mod- els and analytical tools which can be shown to be capable of generating significant cultural re- constructions. Especially is this true in the area of abstracting religious content and "meaning" from material objects preserved in nonhistoric contexts. This situation is probably associated to some degree with the fact that man's ideologi- cal, "supernatural," or religious beliefs lie near the core of his assumptions about the nature of the world, and thus material objects reflecting such beliefs manifest a greater degree of arbitrari- ness in the assignment of meaning to external form. It would seem then that the pre- or proto- historic archaeologist's interpretations and infer- ences concerning the organization of political, social, or economic systems of extinct cultures have a much greater chance of reflecting what "really went on" than do his reconstructions of religious content and meaning. Although recent suggestions have been made that archaeology might be able to reconstruct extinct economic or social systems by the manipulation of data de- rived from purely nonhistoric archaeological in- formation (Binford 1967), the present writer is not aware of any suggestion that a "religious sub- system" can be constructed by observation of the distribution of any set of material objects beyond the rather obvious associations of items which can be determined or assumed to be of "non- functional," "ceremonial," or of primarily ideo- logical significance (Binford 1962). Thus nonhistoric archaeology, in the area of religious or ideological interpretation, apparently has no other recourse but to be dependent upon ethnographic analogy. That an uncritical use of analogy can generate completely erroneous con- clusions does not need to be belabored - 19th- century anthropology in many instances provides rather full documentation for this assertion. And yet it would seem that, in the absence of any other alternative, such uncritical use of analogy seems to be a seductive attraction to a number of investigators.

Unless the con- ditions of the first two previously cited categories of analogy are met, or unless there is developed some new model to deal with the religious sub- system, the only approach which seems justified, in light of our present level of knowledge, is to operate on the level of broad generalized state- ment of probability as to the religious function of observed archaeological features in nonhis- toric cultures.
