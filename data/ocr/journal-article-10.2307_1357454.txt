Nicosia: A. G. Leventis Foundation and University of Cyprus; Brussels: Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Liege: Uni- versite de Liege, 1997. 175 pp., 52 plates. Paper. CY ?20.00. Human and animal forms continue to captivate mod- ern scholars who study the past throughout the world. The presence or absence and abundance or scarcity of these images as well as their representational vs. symbolic qual- ities are debated endlessly and with gusto. The ceramic production on the island of Cyprus between the mid-fifth and late first millennia B.C.E. include examples of the use of human and animal forms in one manner or another either for the vessel form or for the decoration of the ves- sel's surface. To celebrate and to analyze "... . the exub- erant character of Cypriote ceramics and the tendency of the Cypriote potter and vase-painter to use human and animal elements. . ." (p. 3) V. Karageorghis organized an international conference in Nicosia in 1996. This volume is the third in a series of conferences devoted to the exam- ination of these forms in various artistic media. Kara- georghis believes that such scrutiny "... . leads to a better understanding of the art of ancient Cyprus and its culture in general; it also provides evidence for interconnections in the Mediterranean and the relationship of Cyprus with her neighbors" (p. 3). Of note here is the relative paucity of the human form in the decorative schemes of Cypriot vessels over the 4000 years. More often than not on ce- ramics, animal as well as vegetal imagery are preferred in pictorial representations. The 15 papers given at the conference are included in the volume. Thirteen of these are by "the usual suspects" and two are by "younger" scholars. Five of the papers are in French, the remainder in English. The volume com- mences with a perfunctory, general Preface by the editor. The collection is difficult to classify by narrow "cultural phase" definition terms over the 4000 year span because the authors tend to look at either decorative approach or vessel form in discussing the material. All in all the papers tend to be more descriptive in an art-historical sense than analytical in an archaeological one. The meager corpus of human figures in the wall paint- ing of the Ceramic Neolithic period and on the ceramics of the Bronze Age is outlined by P. Astr6m. The incised representations of the Early and earlier Middle Cypriot periods on Red Polished (RP) Ware give way in the late Middle Cypriot to painted ones on White Painted (WP), Bichrome Wheel-made, and White Painted Wheel-made vases. In the Late Cypriot period such images were infre- quent, however, except in Mycenaean-style pottery. E. Her- scher demonstrates that human and animal depictions in relief were more frequent on RP vases during the Early and Middle Cypriot. Large, open Middle Cypriot RP ves- sels with "scenic compositions" with humans, animals, and objects in high relief and/or almost in the round on their shoulders were the primary medium for complex figural representations. The possibility of a more complex figural repertory in LC II inspired by Levantine techniques and Near Eastern iconography is revealed by L. Steele's dis- cussion of a White Slip II krater fragment from a tomb at Kalavasos Agios Dimitrios. The LC IIIB period repre- sents both the end of the Bronze Age and the transition to the early Iron Age. The question of the source(s) of inspi- ration for the 12 known pictorial images on the Proto- White Painted vessels of the LC IIIB vexes M. Iacovou and V. Karageorghis. Despite the obvious Aegean heritage of the ware's shapes and overall manner of decoration, Iaco- vou, following M. Yon, argues that the silhouette tech- nique used in painting the images was directly influenced by Syro-Palestinian decorative styles. Karageorghis, on the</page><page sequence="2">80 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 314 other hand, wishes to believe (despite a minuscule corpus of nonoctopoidal images) that Late Minoan IIIC Cretan pictorial styles should be seen as the more likely primary source. Then, in the subsequent Cypro-Geometric (C-G) I period the Cypriot pictorial tradition with nascent narra- tive elements was transferred back to the Aegean world. The pictorial decoration of the shoulders of Cypro-Archaic and Cypro-Classical period jugs with an applied figurine holding an oinochoe is discussed by E Vandenabeelee. She postulates the existence of various workshops at Mar- ion and at Amathous producing these unusual vessels. The so-called "Amathus Style" of painted decoration on Bi- chrome and on WP amphorae and some jugs is reviewed by A. Hermary in the context of the finds from the French excavations at Amathous. Askoi, rhyta, and various types of related vessels with protomes that in some way employ human or animal forms for the vessels' shape and decoration are the focus of seven papers. The anthropomorphic and zoomorphic askoi in RP, WP, and occasionally Black Polished Wares of the Early and Middle Cypriot periods are analyzed by A. Caubet and. R. S. Merrillees. Animal representations predominate here. M. Yon examines with great insight the few Late Cypriot: zoomorphic rhyta and the more common bull-shaped ves- sels made in various wares. Further, she distinguishes be- tween the potential function(s) of a vessel and its actual. use. Therefore, the paucity of rhyta may not necessarily imply the infrequency of libations since other shapes could have filled this function. During the early Iron Age, pour- ing shapes gain in popularity. Vases with anthropomor- phic protomes and figurinelike plastic vases are analyzed by K. Nys using simple descriptive statistics. She argues that these represent an essentially indigenous phenomenon originating in the LC III and that subsequently there were few stylistic influences moving in either direction between the island and the Aegean. In contrast, N. Kourou, in her discussion of zoomorphic askoi of the same epoch, be- lieves that Mycenaean iconography in the late 12th/llth centuries B.C.E. influenced their creation. Later in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.E., Cypriot zoomorphic askoi in- spired those of the Dodecanese and of Crete. Iron Age vases with a spout in the shape of an animal head are scru- tinized succinctly by A. Hermary. H. Cassismatis discusses the various forms of animal-shaped rhyta that first appear on the island in the 470s B.C.E. A corpus of 60 ring vases with animal-like shape or animal head spouts (and occa- sionally human-shaped) stretching from the late Early Cypriot to C-G III is R. Laffineur's subject. He differentiates five types and illustrates how they were filled and then poured. Each of these authors in some fashion attempts to answer the related questions of the function(s), manner(s) of use, and cultural meaning(s) of their chosen vessel type. Besides stating the obvious, that most of the vessels whose provenance is known come from either cult or funerary contexts, little consensus is achieved on why there coex- isted multiple types of unusual shaped pouring vessels. Later Hellenistic human head-shaped vessels executed in "Magenta Ware" (or better wares) are re-examined by D. Michaelides in light of new examples from Cyprus. He believes that their distribution pattern suggests at least one production center in the East (possibly Cyprus) besides those postulated by others for other parts of the Mediterranean. The lack of at least one invited analytical essay with a broad overview either at the beginning or at the end severely limits the value and ultimate effectiveness of this collection of papers. Not only are the contributions self contained (and they seldom refer systematically to rele- vant points raised by the other authors), they are also nar- rowly focused. Thus, the totality of the Cypriot "forest" of iconography and iconology is lost typically among the "trees" of individual images and shapes. Further, the mostly high-quality illustrations are not overly abundant. Thus, to appreciate the insights of most of the contributions one requires a set of publications at hand to refer to the com- paranda that are cited. As a result of these shortcomings, the reader is given neither a unified theoretical approach to contemplate the Cypriot pictorial repertory nor a full understanding of the entire corpus of images. There are a number of scholars who could have written such an essay. This missed opportunity makes this volume in the end only a reference work for Cypriot scholars looking for specific information. Those with other backgrounds and needs will have to wait for someone to tackle this much needed task for them. David W. Rupp Brock University drupp @ spartan.ac.brocku.ca</page></plain_text>
