However, to date, most of the debate has focused on whether or not to include habitat variables in fragmentation studies, and we still lack general conclusions as well as standard and robust research approaches. In this paper we show how a weak conceptu- alization of "patch quality" and the inappropriate choice of target surrogate variables (e.g., density is often used as an indicator of patch quality) have mainly produced case- specific results, rather than general conclusions. We then identify weaknesses in the inclusion of habitat quality measurements within fragmentation studies. In particular, we focus on: (1) the lack of appropriate experimental design, outlining how few studies have actually included a gradient of habitat quality in their sample; (2) the lack of fundamental information provided (e.g., lack of standard outputs), which in turn hampers the possibility of carrying Communicated by Janne Sundell.

Keywords Habitat degradation · Habitat fragmentation · Habitat loss · Patch quality · Patch structure Introduction Habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation are the greatest extinction threats to biodiversity and are the three main processes contributing to landscape change (Fischer and Lindenmayer 2007). A number of reviews and syntheses have made a substantial contribution towards a thorough conceptual overview of existing "fragmentation studies" (Harrison and Bruna 1999; Fahrig 2003; Fischer and Lindenmayer 2007; Lindenmayer and Fischer 2007); how- ever, most of the debate has focused on habitat loss versus habitat fragmentation, while the third process, habitat deg- radation, has been overlooked (but see Hodgson et al. 2009a, b). Although the three processes tend to co-occur in most landscapes (Lindenmayer and Fischer 2007), while habitat loss and habitat fragmentation rarely occur independently, the degradation of habitat may easily occur independently within continuous ("non-fragmented") landscapes. The process of habitat degradation implies the gradual deterioration of habitat quality. In a degraded habitat, a species may decline, occur at lower density, or may be unable to breed (Felton et al. 2003; Hazell et al. 2004) and, therefore, will have a lower fitness. The process of habitat degradation may also be facilitated or generated by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation (Tabarelli and Gascon 2005; Arroyo-Rodriguez and Mandujano 2006). &lt;Ö Springer</page><page sequence="2">536 Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 The process of habitat degradation in fragmented land- scapes can generate a pattern of variation in patch quality for a given species, the consequence of which is a land mosaic likely composed of an archipelago of patches with variable levels of suitability. An analogous pattern, how- ever, may also occur as a result of pre-existing environ- mental heterogeneity, such as when a landscape with a gradient for habitat quality (e.g., for natural reasons, such as different water availability or terrain slope, among others) is modified by the loss and subdivision of habitat. In the latter case, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are present as isolated patches with different quality, but the former have not caused the latter. There is increasing empirical evidence that the "quality" of habitat patches plays a substantial role in determining species' distribution patterns and in regulating spatial dynamics in fragmented landscapes (Thomas et al. 2001). An important role of "patch quality" as determinant of occupancy patterns has been shown for plants (Adriaens et al. 2009), butterflies (Thomas et al. 2001; Fleishman et al. 2002), moths (Summerville and Crist 2004), other insects (Wettstein and Schmid 1999; Heisswolf et al. 2009), amphibians (Marsh and Trenham 2001) birds (Verboom et al. 1991; Lloyd 2008), small mammals (Holland and Bennett 2007), primates (Arroyo-Rodriguez and Mandujano 2006), and carnivores (Virgos 2001; Mortelliti and Boitani 2008). Several authors have made a plea for the incorporation of habitat quality in metapopulation models (Thomas et al. 2001; Armstrong 2005), and the importance of habitat quality has been recognized by theoretical studies that have investigated the usefulness of including patch quality in metapopulation models (Moilanen and Hanski 1998; DeWoody et al. 2005) and in connectivity metrics (Visconti and Elkin 2009). However, most of the debate has focused on whether or not to include measurements of habitat quality in metapopulation models and in fragmen- tation studies. Despite the attention this topic has received, research in this area is still lacking. Researchers require (1) a thorough conceptualization of what we mean by "habitat and patch quality"; (2) standard and robust field research approaches that will allow quantitative meta-analyses and generalization of results; (3) general conclusions. An accurate understanding of the actual role played by patch quality is important for several reasons. From the per- spective of conservation biology, overlooking the importance of patch quality is likely to lead to ineffective conservation policy in fragmented landscapes: if a species is threatened by the degradation of habitat patches, the most appropriate conservation strategy should be habitat management. Nev- ertheless, most of the conservation policy in fragmented landscapes, particularly in European landscapes, is aimed towards the implementation of linkages between landscape elements and is largely focused on the spatial structure α Springer (structural connectivity) of landscapes (Boitani et al. 2007), therefore largely overlooking the content of habitat patches. From a more ecological perspective the full understand- ing of the role played by patch quality has important implications both for landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology paradigms. From the perspective of landscape ecology, the gap between incorporating and not incorpo- rating information on the quality of habitat is the same as the gap which exists between structural connectivity and func- tional connectivity: we can have perfectly "linked" land- scape elements, which are functionally disconnected for the landscape inhabitants. From the perspective of metapopu- lation ecology, empirical studies have suggested how, for instance, spatial autocorrelation in habitat quality can affect metapopulation persistence (Schooley and Branch 2007). The aims of our paper are to: (1) provide a conceptual overview of the issue of "patch quality" with particular reference to field studies; (2) identify weaknesses in the measurement and interpretation of habitat quality within fragmentation studies; (3) synthesize available knowledge from empirical research; (4) provide a research prospectus for the future. Our work is structured in six sections. In the section "Conceptual overview" we provide a conceptual overview of the issue of patch quality. We begin by giving quantitative definitions of habitat quality and continue by discussing them within the context of fragmented landscapes. In the section "Measurements of patch quality and scope of the studies", we undertake a critical analysis on commonly adopted methods to measure habitat quality, highlighting the major weaknesses of each method (e.g., density and habitat structure are often used as an indicators of habitat quality). In the section "Experimental design in field research", we discuss the lack of appropriate experimental design in most field studies, addressing habitat quality, and we stress the lack of standard protocols and standard outputs in published research that hamper any possibility of carrying out meta- analyses. In the section "When does patch quality matter? Empirical findings", we provide an overview of the main empirical findings focusing on: (1) patch occupancy (e.g., small populations inhabit a patch) and (2) patch use (e.g., several patches are included in the home range of a single individual). In the section "Research prospectus" we pro- vide a research prospectus based on the four aims of our article. In the section "Patch quality in the context of con- ceptual landscape models" we discuss the issue of patch quality within the context of landscape conceptual models. In order to undertake a critical analysis of the conceptu- alization, measurement and relative importance of patch quality in fragmented landscapes we carried out a literature search of papers on distribution studies where measurements of "patch quality" or its surrogates were employed.

The main search was carried out in July 2009, and an update for recent papers was carried out in October 2009. An additional literature search was performed on key- authors and on the references of the selected papers. Fol- lowing an assessment of topical relevance of all papers highlighted by the original search, we inserted 65 papers into the review database [Appendix 2 in Electronic Supplemen- tary Material (ESM)]. We excluded purely theoretical studies; however, where important conclusions have been published, we have considered the results. We believe we have included a substantial proportion of published studies focusing on the role of patch quality; however, we do acknowledge that due to the relatively fuzzy limits of the topic, some papers may have been missed. Conceptual overview Definitions of habitat quality A summary of the definitions adopted in this paper is provided in Table 1. The "habitat" for a given species has been defined as the resources and conditions in an area that produce occupancy (Hall et al. 1997), while "habitat quality" has been defined as the ability of the environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and pop- ulation persistence (Hall et al. 1997). In contrast, Van Home (1983) defined habitat quality as the mean individual fitness per unit area, quantifying it as a function of density, offspring production, and survival (see Appendix 1 for a quantitative definition). Later, in his classical paper on sink-source population structure, Pulliam (1988) viewed habitat quality at the base of source/sink dynamics: in source habitats (e.g., habitats of higher quality), births exceed deaths and emigration exceeds immigration; in sink habitats (e.g., habitats of lower quality), deaths exceed births and emigration exceeds immigration. Since the above definitions apply only to populations at equilibrium, Pulliam (1988) con- cluded that a more general definition would be that sources are populations where, over a relatively long time period, there is a net export of individuals, while sinks are popu- lations where there is a net import of individuals (see Appendix 1 for a quantitative definition). As argued by Runge et al. (2006), the definition of Pulliam (1988) does not include mortality during emigra- tion. Such mortality, however, can have a profound effect on the growth of spatially structured populations. Using 4y Springer</page><page sequence="4">538 Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 this concept as a base, Runge et al. (2006) have extended the concept of sources and sinks by stressing the role of the local populations in a landscape context. In a nutshell, Runge et al. (2006) defined the metric C (see Appendix 1 for more quantitative details) as the per capita contribution of a member of a focal subpopulation to the whole spatially structured population. If C &gt; 1 the focal subpopulation contributes more individuals than it loses and is a source. The crucial aspect of C is that it provides a wider and more realistic perspective to the définition of sinks and sources: the term C represents net gains for the entire system rather than for the population alone (Runge et al. 2006). The strength of the above-mentioned conceptual frameworks is that they link habitat quality to its effect on populations - rather than viewing it as a combination of habitat attributes. The crucial point is that if we measure the quality of a habitat as a combination of habitat attri- butes we risk adopting a subjective and anthropomorphic perspective, while if we adopt the former approach, the quality of the habitat becomes an objective, rather than a subjective, measurement. The definitions of Pulliam (1988) and Runge et al. (2006), however, focus on source and sink habitats. Although the quality of a habitat is often viewed as a major driver of sink-source dynamics (Thomas and Kunin 1999), a sink and a source could be the result of several other factors in addition to the quality of the habitat (Kawecki 2004). In fragmented landscapes, for example, the geo- metrical properties of patches have substantial effects on populations, including demographic parameters, such as survival and emigration (Hanski and Gaggiotti 2004), that are at the base of the above-mentioned conceptualizations of source sink habitats and habitat quality. As a conse- quence, disentangling the role of habitat quality from that of the spatial configuration of patches may be quite com- plicated (but see Pöyry et al. 2009 and Zheng et al. 2009). From habitat quality to patch quality In the following four points we list some of the caveats that could arise when the quantitative definitions of Van Home (1983), Pulliam (1988), and Runge et al. (2006) are applied to habitat patches in fragmented landscapes: 1. The definition of Van Home (1983; Eq. 1 in Appendix 1) implicitly takes into account the effect of habitat area on habitat quality, since patch quality is nega- tively dependent on patch area, namely, a smaller patch with the same values of population parameters as a larger one will result in a patch of higher quality. This is the opposite of what is done in metapopulation models considering patch quality (Moilanen and Ö Springer Effect on population (survival, fecundity £ 5" 1 etc) | S CO i- I f 1 c ι 1 u) ω Limiting resources .£ (0 I _ I (O Î z' ! - τ ^ ι 1 Π Patch characteristics ' / (vegetation structure, ' / microclimate etc) γ Fig. 1 The hierarchical relationship among the different possible levels at which patch quality can be assessed Hanski 1998): in these cases, higher patch quality is quantified by increasing patch size and decreasing patch isolation. Similar caveats may apply to Pulliam' s definition since patches covering larger areas may receive more immigrants, especially with passive dispersal (Kawecki 2004) and since growth rates may be influenced both by habitat quality and habitat size (Griffen and Drake 2008). As a consequence, Kawecki (2004) suggested that the reproductive values of populations (measured as the expected long-term contribution of an individual to population growth and to future gene pool) would be more appropriate. 2. The mean individual fitness, population growth rates and Cr can be calculated only if patches are occupied by populations of the target species. In fragmented landscapes, the proportion of suitable unoccupied patches is likely to be high for several reasons, including stochastic extinctions caused by small pop- ulation sizes. In such circumstances, measurements of the key limiting resources should be the most accurate option (Fig. 1). 3. The strength and the novelty of the parameter C is that it considers successful emigration which, in the context of defining sink-source dynamics, is extremely useful. Nevertheless, this parameter should be applied with caution to studies in which the focus is to evaluate the role of patch quality. Once the individuals leave the patch, their destiny will depend on (1) the spatial structure surrounding the focal patch (the spatial arrangements of patches and their proximity); (2) the characteristics of the matrix (non-habitat where appli- cable), including the prédation risk; (3) the perceptual range or dispersal capabilities that contribute to determining the chance of reaching another habitat patch (Schooley and Wiens 2003). These characteris- tics may be quantified with a dispersal function (Wiens 2001), but they are not related to the quality of habitat</page><page sequence="5">Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 539 in a patch. At the same time, although there is no empirical evidence, we cannot exclude that high- quality patches produce healthier individuals that may complete dispersal more successfully. 4. Immigrating individuals (considered by Van Home 1983) should be accounted for once they reach the patch and produce offspring, assuming that the production of offspring does not depend on the patch occupied previously. Additional complications for the three conceptualiza- tions are: (1) it may not be feasible in many field studies to measure those variables necessary to apply the concepts of Van Home (1983), Pulliam (1988), and Runge et al. (2006); (2) in many cases, this kind of information will be available a posteriori of field research. Taking these caveats into account, one could argue about the applica- bility of these conceptualizations. However, we stress that the strength of the conceptualizations of Van Home (1983), Pulliam (1988), and Runge et al. (2006) are that they highlight crucial parameters that should be considered when assessing the quality of a patch. Even if gross proxies, such as vegetation structure, are used, we should always ask ourselves whether the vegetation structure that we are using as surrogate of habitat quality is likely to affect, for example, offspring production and survival. Measurements of patch quality and scope of the studies Measuring habitat and patch quality in real landscapes A variety of methods have been used to measure habitat quality in the field in which both individuals and popula- tions are taken into consideration (see Johnson 2007 for a review on measurements in continuous landscapes). A first set of methods consists in the direct measure- ments of habitat attributes. An important distinction exists in this group between methods that measure the structure of habitat using it as a proxy of habitat quality (e.g., Santos et al. 2008) and methods that involve the measurement of limiting resources (Matter et al. 2009) (Fig. 1). In 48.3% of the papers examined, the structure of the patch was used as a surrogate measurement of patch quality. The "structure" of the patch may range from habitat features (e.g., Lloyd 2008) to the depth of ponds (Denoel and Lehmann 2006), depending on the target species. In some cases, even the area of a patch was considered as a quality measurement (e.g., Anzures-Dadda and Manson 2007). The major shortfall of such measurements is that unless we have a clear quantitative understanding on how well these corre- late with the actual quality, the assumption that variable patch structure takes on the same meaning as variable patch quality involves a leap of faith. We thus stress that the terms patch structure and patch quality should not be used interchangeably unless there is a clear biologically mean- ingful link between them because this will inevitably lead to a simplistic or even spurious interpretation of results. The measurement of trophic or other resources are another common method to measure the quality of a patch (Johnson 2007). Measured resources may vary from host- plant density for butterflies (e.g., Heisswolf et al. 2009) to den availability (e.g., Virgos 2001) and food abundance (e.g., Schooley and Branch 2007; Mortelliti and Boitani 2008; Verbeylen et al. 2009). Provided that the experi- mental design and the subsequent analysis allow the researcher to (1) separate the independent contribution of resources from the role of the geometry of the patch and (2) subsequently test for the interaction between resources in the patch and the geometrical features, the measurement of resources as a proxy for patch quality may be a good compromise in many cases. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that such measurements may be easy for small inverte- brates but extremely complex for poorly known vertebrate species. In addition, it is important to be cautious in interpreting such results since "resources" need to be limiting resources and several key-factors other than tro- phic resources may also play a crucial role. A second group of measurements consists of methods where the quality of habitat is inferred through the exam- ination of its effects on populations (Fig. 1). Such methods are, therefore, more related to the conceptualizations and quantification of patch quality discussed in the first para- graph and include the measurement of reproduction, sur- vival, and population growth rates (e.g., Franken and Hik 2004). The application of these methods in field studies is, however, not easy with taxa such as vertebrates and, most importantly, it is complicated by the fact that patch-land- scape properties may have a significant effect on the same population attributes. In addition, we stress that such information will be available only for occupied patches and a posteriori of field research results; consequently, designing a study with the certainty that the sample includes a substantial variation in the quality of patches may be quite difficult in some cases (see section on "Measurements of patch quality and scope of the studies"). Within this group of demographic measurements, den- sity and/or abundance are often used as indicators of patch quality, particularly in studies on invertebrates (e.g., Rabasa et al. 2007; Heisswolf et al. 2009; Hodgson et al. 2009a, b). Van Home's (1983) main conclusion was that density is a misleading indicator of habitat quality, as is the case of despotic distributions where a higher concentration of individuals occurs in low-quality habitats. Although the issue of "patch quality and density" usually arises in studies on vertebrates, there are several occasions in which Ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">540 Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 even invertebrates may show similar patterns (Matter et al. 2009), such as when predators or diseases are keeping density in a patch at low levels. A third group of methods consists of studies focusing on distributional measurements, such as temporal patterns of occupancy (Sergio and Newton 2003). Again, there is a high risk of confounding effects with patch/landscape properties. A fourth group of measurements that has been applied, albeit mainly on birds in continuous landscapes, consists of the measurement of individual conditions, such as morphology and physiology of the individual. Caution in the application of these two methods is warranted since (1) variations in body condition may be the cause of habitat selection rather than the consequence, (2) variation in body condition must determine a variation in reproduction and survival, and (3) time-lag effects may be possible (Johnson 2007). Aim of the studies The aim of many of the studies mentioned in the preceding sections was to evaluate whether or not patch quality plays a role in fragmented landscapes. Dependent on the manner in which we implicitly or explicitly define patch quality (properties of the habitat in the patch that will have an effect on population parameters such as survival and fecundity), it inevitably follows that patch quality has to play a role in the distribution patterns since survival, fecundity, and density are key drivers for the survival of a population in fragmented as well as in continuous land- scapes. Designing a study on such questions leads to a tautology: we are merely identifying the range of possi- bilities given our premises (Peters 1991): it does play a role versus it does not play a role. The logical answer will be that it does in certain conditions (e.g., certain species/cer- tain environments/parts of a species range) and it does not in other (other species/other environments/other parts of a species range), and this inevitably leads to species-specific, landscape-specific, or case-specific results that are so typical of landscape ecology and conservation biology (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). If we are to upgrade the "patch quality dilemma" to a more general theory, we must identify a smaller set of probabilities within the range "it does/does not play a role" and most of all, we must understand when and why it does. Experimental design in field research The majority of fragmentation studies include a gradient of habitat loss and fragmentation (in landscape-scale studies) or of patch size and isolation (in patch-scale studies). When it comes to evaluating the role of patch quality, rather than Ô Springer a gradient of habitat degradation or a gradient of patch quality, in most studies (e.g., Rabasa et al. 2007; Virgos 2001; Heisswolf et al. 2009) researchers allow the quality of the patch (or, more often, its surrogate measurements) to vary without any control. Consequently, even if patches of variable quality are included in the sample, it is only rarely that the range of suitability is ever confirmed to be actually meaningful. If, for instance, in our sample the range of patch quality is from highly suitable to suitable, the chances of detecting a significant effect are low, and any other variables with stronger gradients (e.g., size or isola- tion of the patch) included in the study are more likely to play a major role in the models. Few studies (e.g., Franken and Hik 2004; Schooley and Branch 2007) have created experimental conditions that have appropriately evaluated the role of patch quality; as such, the claim that the role of patch quality is actually being investigated is occasionally more a rhetorical question than a true, tested hypothesis. In addition, we stress that few studies provide quanti- tative information on the range and variability of the patch structure variables in question (e.g., Table 1 in Krauss et al. 2005). Without such information, it is not possible to evaluate whether a substantial variation in patch quality (or its surrogate measurements) was included in the sample. In addition to the weak conceptualization of patch quality and the lack of experimental design discussed in the previous paragraphs, an additional factor that hampers a clear synthesis or meta-analyses on the role of patch quality in fragmented landscapes is the lack of standardized mea- surements. Given that the majority of studies use patch internal structure (or vegetation structure) as a surrogate measurement for the quality of patches (e.g., Holland and Bennett 2007; Mortelliti et al. 2009), there is still no con- sensus or consistency on how to measure such variables (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). Even in studies on inverte- brates, where resource abundance is used as a quality indicator, inconsistency is not uncommon: for example, Krauss et al. (2005) did not consider the abundance of host plants (resources) as habitat quality, unlike Grundel and Pavlovic (2007) and Fred and Brommer (2003). When does patch quality matter? Empirical findings Patch occupancy Moilanen and Hanski (1998) evaluated the usefulness of including patch quality in metapopulation models and concluded that patch area and connectivity were sufficient to explain patch occupancy patterns, since the inclusion of extra environmental factors did not improve the power of the models. In their simulation study (validated on field data), the quantification of habitat quality was carried out</page><page sequence="7">Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 541 by modifying the extinction risk for a given patch, which was in turn quantitatively performed by modifying patch area and isolation (e.g., decrease in patch quality = smaller size and increased isolation). If, on one hand, the authors conclude that their findings facilitate the gathering of data, at the same time they admit that there is no theoretical reason to expect that habitat quality has no major effect on metapopulation dynamics. In their case study, for example, habitat quality was quite uniform throughout the study area; therefore, no strong gradient was included. Similarly, in an earlier study, Hanski et al. (1996) concluded that the poor predictions of metapopulation models in part of their study area may have been due to variations in habitat quality that had not been included in the models. Further field evidence confirming Moilanen and Hanski' s (1998) results has been reported by Rabasa et al. (2008) and Krauss et al. (2005). In the latter case, however, the abun- dance of host plants (resources) was not considered as habitat quality, unlike Grundel and Pavlovic (2007) and Fred and Brommer (2003), and the authors emphasize how the conclusions of Moilanen and Hanski (1998) may depend on the fact that habitat area often correlates with larval food quantity (Krauss et al. 2004, 2005). In contrast, most empirical studies have consistently reported that the inclusion of patch structure or patch "quality" variables improves the explanatory power of models. While most studies have focused on patch occu- pancy (Dennis and Eales 1997; Thomas et al. 2001) or abundance (Lloyd 2008; Heisswolf et al. 2009), there is evidence of an important role of colonization and extinc- tion parameters (Fleishman et al. 2002; Franken and Hik 2004) while Rabasa et al. (2007) found no effect on dis- persal. Franken and Hik (2004) found that patches of higher quality (measured as average survival throughout 4 years and with structural characteristics) had higher chances of being recolonized and lower chances of becoming extinct, while Fleishman et al. (2002) found that patch quality affected most variance in occupancy and turnover rates. Kuussaari et al. (1996) found an effect of patch quality (resource abundance) on emigration rates, namely, that the latter were lower in patches with higher resource abun- dance. More recently, Matter et al. (2009) found no effect of habitat quality alone (measured as the density of nectar plants) on immigration. In the latter study, only accessible (less isolated) high-quality habitat received high rates of immigrants; in contrast, habitat quality did not affect abundance or population growth, but it did affect repro- ductive output. This carefully designed study allowed researchers to highlight an interaction between patch quality and one geometrical property of patches (isolation), and the results strongly suggest that such interactions should always be considered (see also Betzholtz et al. (2007). In addition, the results of simulation studies carried out with empirical data strongly suggest that the quality of the habitat is crucial for the long-term persistence of pop- ulations (Root 1998) since it strongly affects extinction probability. Pöyry et al. (2009) applied the hierarchical partitioning technique to evaluate the independent contribution of habitat quality (measured as food resources) versus con- nectivity (measured at a regional level) and habitat patch area. These authors demonstrated how local habitat quality had the highest independent effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. Patterns of variation of patch quality in space and time have crucial effects on the population(s) inhabiting frag- mented landscapes. On a small scale, within-patch varia- tion of patch quality has been found to affect extinction: homogeneous patches were predicted to have a higher extinction risk (Kindvall 1996). On a larger scale (between patches), the importance of spatial autocorrelation in patch quality has been studied by Schooley and Branch (2007), who found that spatial autocorrelation in patch quality generated neighborhoods of high-quality and low-quality patches. The first implication is that spatial autocorrelation in patch quality (a patch level process) generates a cross- scale interaction since it determines broader distribution patterns. From a metapopulation perspective, spatially correlated extinctions resulting, for example, from spatially correlated low-quality patches will reduce metapopulation viability. The most important implications of these findings are for habitat management. Although habitat management is primarily carried out on the patch scale, we should also consider the landscape scale and manage entire mosaics (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). Several theoretical studies have explored the dynamics of metapopulations in successional landscapes (e.g., De Woody et al. 2005; Gyllenberg and Hanski 1997) where habitat quality for a given species varies through time. Hodgson et al. (2009a, b) have field tested the three main predictions arising from theoretical studies, showing that (1) metapopulations inhabiting dynamic habitats have lower occupancy because of higher extinction rates; (2) increasing connectivity of a patch does not lead to increasing occupancy in dynamic habitats; (3) patch quality is a poorer predictor of patch occupancy in dynamic rather than in static habitats because in the latter patches are more likely to be occupied in the long term. An important implication for conservation is that the amount of habitat occupied at a given time is less than the total amount of habitat important for the species' persistence. Conse- quently, conservation planning should take into account unoccupied - but also potentially suitable - habitat. The results summarized above suggest three major weaknesses in the general body of research: α Springer</page><page sequence="8">542 Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 1. Even if accurate measurements of patch quality are rare, the trend is that patch quality (or its surrogate measurements) plays a role in determining the occu- pancy of certain species in certain environments. However, the underlying processes are far from clear. We do not know, for instance, which species' traits (e.g., habitat specialist vs. habitat generalist, insectiv- orous vs. granivorous, etc.) are important in determin- ing whether patch quality is a crucial determinant of its distribution. Similarly, it is unclear whether the role of patch quality varies throughout the species' range or whether patch quality plays an important role only within certain thresholds of spatial characteristics (e.g., within certain thresholds of patch size and patch isolation). In addition, we stress that there is a substantial bias in the taxonomic scope of the studies since approximately one-third of those reviewed here focused on butterflies (Appendix 2 in ESM). 2. Many studies have focused on occupancy patterns and, specifically, on the role of patch quality in determining presence/absence of a species, and a few studies have focused on colonization/extinction patterns, but little has been done on the effect on dispersal patterns (but see North and Ovaskainen 2007; Rabasa et al. 2007; Ovaskainen et al. 2008). We do not know, for example, whether high-quality patches provide more successful dispersers/colonizers than lower quality patches; that is, whether the higher quality patches support healthier individuals that are more likely to survive the dispersal period and colonize successfully other patches. 3. Habitat quality in fragmented landscapes has an important temporal and spatial component. However, most of the distribution studies published to date treat it only as a patch level property, irrespective of its spatial and temporal profile Effects of patch quality on patch use Lima and Zollner (1996) suggest that a behavioral ecol- ogy approach be applied when patch use (e.g., several patches are included in the home range of a single indi- vidual) and not patch occupancy (e.g., small populations inhabiting a patch) is being studied. Approaches to the study of animal movements in heterogeneous landscapes have been categorized into two groups: information-based and information-free approaches (Lima and Zollner 1996). Information-based approaches endow an animal with some information about its landscape and the ability to use that information in a decision-making process (e.g., optimal foraging, non-random walks). In contrast, infor- mation-free approaches (e.g., random walks) assume that animals have no knowledge of the general landscape or Ô Springer their immediate surroundings and that they gain no information while moving across a landscape. The second category of approaches are biased towards arthropods due to the assumption of their lower cognitive abilities (Lima and Zollner 1996), while they are far too simplistic for studying the complex landscape perception of vertebrates. The role of patch quality is crucial in the information- based approaches, and results from field studies suggest that cost/benefit tradeoffs will determine whether a patch will be used or not and that this, in turn, will depend on the interaction of landscape (or patch) structure, the availability of resources within the patch (patch quality), and the perceptual range of the species. Impaired foraging resulting from spatial isolation of food resources has been observed in frugivorous birds: Guevara et al. (1998) and Luck and Daily (2003) observed that visitation rates of fruit trees decreased with their isolation. Mortelliti and Boitani (2008) observed an interaction of food resources and landscape structure in determining the probability of patch use of two carnivores (the badger Meles meles and the beech marten Martes foina): within certain limits of patch size/isolation, an increase of resources could lead to an increase in the probability of presence in a patch. However, the smallest and most isolated patches would never reach high presence probability despite an increase in resources. Research prospectus In this following section, we suggest a research prospectus based on the key issues discussed in the preceding sections. The major points are summarized in Table 2. Measuring patch quality In Fig. 1 we highlight the hierarchical relationship among the different possible levels at which patch quality can be assessed. The first level (effect on population) provides the most accurate measurement of patch quality; however, this comes at the cost of more complex measurability (see Franken and Hik 2004 for an example) and possible con- founding effects with spatial properties of the patches/ landscapes. The second level involves the measurement of key resources that are likely to play a role in determining parameters measured in the first level, such as survival, fecundity, and density. The third level (patch structure) is the easiest to measure - at the cost of low accuracy. The intermediate level (key resources) is likely to be the best compromise for most studies. This analysis highlights the importance of basic autoecological studies that will help to clearly frame the needs of the target species and</page><page sequence="9">Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 543 Table 2 Checklist of major weaknesses of current research approaches and prospectus for future research Key point Weaknesses Prospectus for future research Weak conceptualization Many studies use the density of the target Do not use density as measurement of of patch quality species as an indicator of habitat patch patch quality, unless you can prove that quality density increases with habitat quality Many studies evaluate the quality of Priority should be given to evaluate the habitat patches through habitat structure quality of a patch through its effects (higher level in Fig. 1) followed by key resource abundance (intermediate level in Fig. 1) and, ultimately, habitat structure (but a relationship with key resources should be assessed) Lack of experimental Few studies include a substantial gradient Include a gradient of patch quality design of patch quality in their sample of patches Most studies do not experimentally Follow an experimental design (e.g., disentangle the role of variation in factorial design) and statistical analysis quality of habitat patches from patch (e.g., variation partitioning) that will size and isolation allow evaluation of the independent contribution Aim of the studies Few field studies focus on (1) processes More emphasis should be given to (1) determining species' sensitivity to patch exploring possible predictors of species' quality, (2) dispersal parameters sensitivity to patch quality, (2) field (particularly vertebrates), (3) temporal studies of dispersal parameters and spatial components of patch quality (particularly vertebrates), (3) analyzing wider spatial and temporal scales Lack of standard outputs in Many studies do not publish basic Include quantitative information on the published studies information sampled gradient in patch quality Adopt standard approaches for resource and vegetation measurements maximize the strength of results from fragmentation studies. Appropriate experimental designs Three crucial aspects of studies on fragmented landscapes that require attention have emerged from our review. 1. The first issue is that we need to include stronger gradients in the quality of habitats in our studies (or provide compelling quantitative evidence that a sub- stantial gradient was included). Allowing the quality of patches to vary without any control will not help the researcher to gain an understanding of when and within which thresholds the quality of patches is fundamental. In order to be sure that a substantial gradient in habitat quality has been included in the sample (in those cases where patch quality or its surrogate variables will only be available following the field research), the researcher should carry out a preliminary assessment of quality through pilot studies prior to sampling. 2. Where possible, studies should be designed so that it is possible to disentangle the role of different processes, such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation per se, and habitat degradation or patch size, patch isolation, among others (when carried out at the patch scale). While it may be relatively easy to design such studies for use in field experiments, it may be quite compli- cated in mensurative field studies where such charac- teristics are likely to be highly correlated. However, carefully following (or approximating) an appropriate factorial design (Quinn and Keough 2002) will surely help in this context. In observational studies where the appropriate experimental design is not applicable, analyses should be carried out using methods such as hierarchical partitioning or variation partitioning which allow the researcher to evaluate the independent contribution of the correlated variables (see Pöyry et al. 2009 for an application). 3. More effort should be made in applying standard protocols for the measurement of vegetation cover or vegetation structure (e.g., Hill et al. 2005), especially if we consider that our models should be applicable elsewhere. The inclusion of quantitative information on the mean and range of values of patch structure/ quality variables will facilitate the inclusion of the latter in future meta-analyses and allow comparisons with other studies as well as replications of the study. α Springer</page><page sequence="10">544 Oecologia (2010) 163:535-547 Towards general rules on the contribution of patch quality in fragmented landscapes Patch occupancy studies The weaknesses discussed in the above sections have limited the contribution of empirical findings to a more general and detailed understanding of the role of patch quality in fragmented landscapes. In addition, future research should broaden the scope of studies on patch quality, also including the exploration of possible species' traits useful for predicting where and to what extent the quality of a habitat is a relevant explanatory variable [see Swihart et al. (2006) for predictors of sensitivity to habitat loss and habitat fragmentation]. Furthermore, future research should focus on additional parameters, such as species' dispersal (particularly in field studies on verte- brates) and should address the topic at wider spatial and temporal scales. Patch use studies As we have shown, results from empirical research suggest that both the perceptual range and amount of resources are clearly involved in determining patch use patterns. How- ever, more studies are needed to understand the extent to which perceptual range (the possibility of remote patches being sighted) may act as a determinant for patch use (Lima and Zollner 1996; Schooley and Wiens 2003) rather than simply cost/benefit tradeoffs. A more clear under- standing of such issues will help in determining when and where habitat management targeted at increasing resource abundance will improve the functional connectivity of a given landscape. Patch quality in the context of conceptual landscape models The need and importance of conceptual landscape models has been discussed by Fischer et al. (2004) and Fischer and Lindenmayer (2007) who pooled them into three groups: fragmentation versus variegation versus contour models. Fragmentation models are based on the contrast between habitat (clearly defined patches) and non-habitat (surrounding matrix) but may allow within-patch hetero- geneity. In comparison, variegation models allow a gradual change in vegetation cover and are not therefore focused on the delineation of patches. The landscape contour model focuses on multiple species and views landscapes as the overlay of habitat contours maps, where peaks and troughs represent the different levels of suit- ability for the species. £} Springer The two latter models are explicitly based on gradients of habitat quality and therefore directly tackle the issue of habitat quality in fragmented landscapes. In addition, the fact that landscapes are not viewed as being composed by clearly delineated patches implicitly overcomes the sim- plification of patch quality as an averaged attribute of a habitat patch which may be an extreme simplification especially in large patches. If we consider, as has been maintained by Fischer et al. (2004), that the variegation and fragmentation model may be viewed as specific cases of the contour model, it follows that the contour model is the most general model. Therefore, designing a study based on this model will automatically force the view of the land- scape as a complex mosaic of environments with different suitability levels, including areas where habitat quality is null (the matrix), and that corresponds to the fragmentation model with within patch heterogeneity. The whole body of research focusing on species distri- bution modeling is essentially concerned with spatially varying habitat quality - although often at a broader scale than those examined in fragmentation studies (but see Jaquiéry et al. 2008 and Drielsma and Ferrier 2009) and, therefore, the "quality" is often measured with broad sur- rogates (such as presence-absence data; but see Falcucci et al. 2009 for incorporation of a demographic parameter such as mortality). If species distribution modeling is car- ried out at a scale where the configuration of habitat is likely to play an important role, more effort should be undertaken to measure (and model) the quality of habitat appropriately. Conclusions Our main conclusions are that, at first, a weak or vague conceptualization of what we mean by patch and habitat quality in our studied systems has been the first obstacle to arriving at general conclusions on the role played by the quality of patches in fragmented landscapes. Sec- ondly, as the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation would not be studied without a range of experimental conditions, the contribution of patch quality in landscapes should not be studied with little to no range of patch suitability. Thirdly, the lack - or omission - of standard outputs on the experimental conditions in which research has been carried out hampers the possibility of making comparisons and, more importantly, makes our results really unique in that they are not only species/landscape/ case specific, but also unrepeatable. We finally stress that patch quality, more than other topics in spatial ecology, is strongly driven by species- specific determinants.

Appendix 1: Quantitative definitions of habitat quality and source-sink habitats 1. Definition of the quality of a given habitat by Van Home (1983): {[Σ^^(/^+Ρ^)]/Ση,}(ΐ/^) ßj is the relative quality of habitat for a given species, Bx is the fecundity of a x-year old, and /a is the probability that the offspring will survive to a, a being the first age of breeding. Ρ is the probability of surviving from age χ to age χ + 1, η is the number of individuals in each of the / habitats being compared, and a is the area that includes all sampled individuals in the /th habitat. 2. Definition of source and sink habitats by Pulliam (1988) Ã = PA+P&amp; (2) λ is the population growth rate of a given population in a given habitat; PA and P-} are the habitat specific survival rates of adults (A) and juveniles (J); β is the habitat specific per capita reproductive rate. In a source habitat λ &gt; 1, while in a sink λ &lt; 1. This definition assumes that populations are at equilibrium and that survival is measured from pre-breeding to pre-dispersal (not annually). 3. Definition of the contribution of a local subpopulation to the whole spatially structured population by Runge et al. (2006): ^ = φι+Εφα+^(φγ+Σφγ) (3) Cr is the contribution of a member of the focal subpopulation "r" to the spatially structured population; Φα is the apparent survival of adults that remain in the subpopulation r; Φα is the apparent survival of adults that emigrate to other subpopulations; ßr is the number of juveniles per adult; O[r is the apparent survival of juveniles that remain the subpopulation r, and Φ™ is the apparent survival of juveniles that emigrate to other subpopulations. If C &gt; 1, the focal subpopulation contributes more individuals than it loses via mortality and is a source. If C &lt; 1, the focal subpopulation loses more animals to mortality than it contributes and is a sink.
