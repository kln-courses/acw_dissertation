<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY IN THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY. A GLANCE back at the state of psychology in I892 when the PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW was founded shows very important advances in practically every field. To be sure the main outlines of the science had been well developed. The attitudes and the more general methods were much the same as they are today. Wundt's system had reached approximately its final form; James had published his chief books, and Ribot had written his more important works. But much of the experi- mental work upon which the modern discussion is based was still to be done. With some important exceptions experiment had been confined to sensation, to Weber's Law, to space perception, and to reaction times. Ebbinghaus alone had worked on memory; only preliminary experiments had been made upon association and the ideational processes; the physiological accompaniments of mental processes had been little studied, and most of the results obtained were found later to be incorrect. While the central problems of the science had been investi- gated relatively little, most of the applications and the branches of psychology had been almost neglected. Educational problems were, still treated in an a priori way or as the result of uncon- firmed opinion; psychiatry had felt the influence of modern psychological results and methods through the work of Kraepelin, but the experimental study of the mental processes of the insane was hardly begun. Animal psychology was largely a collection of anecdotes with incidental theoretical discussions. None of the many suggested or actually developed applications of psy- chology were even begun. Tracing the developments in each of these fields gives an interesting side light upon the methods and tendencies in the more central province. It can be seen very readily that progress in each of these departments has depended upon the analysis of general problems 56</page><page sequence="2">NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 57 into part problems and upon devising new methods of approach. Both the problems and the methods are frequently suggested from the more theoretical and technical psychological results or from other sciences, and when once developed have an important influence upon other problems and in other fields. The applications to education at the different stages show the influence of both factors. The first of the modern phases, child study, was no more than an extension of observation under careful conditions to infants and collecting more numerous data, in part from the untrustworthy source of the questionnaire. Beginning with Preyer's work child-study occupied a large place in the literature for several years. The net result was not important for either psychology or education. The extreme youth of the children used and the superficial methods employed made the results for education relatively slight. In retrospect the number of thorough studies made seems surprisingly small in view of the large amount of space the method had in the con- temporary literature. Not more than a dozen children were studied thoroughly. The lasting results were also compara- tively few. Baldwin got confirmation of the motor theory from his studies, but the suggestions for that as well as the emphasis on imitation came from Ribot and Tarde rather than from the observations and experiments themselves. To the questionnaire method we owe Stanley Hall's monumental work on Adolescence. After all, however, the main gain from this method was an increased recognition of the importance of an empirical study of the child and of educational problems in general. The second factor that made possible an advance in this field was the application of the statistical methods of Pearson and his school,-the coefficient of correlation and the methods of ob- taining a common opinion from masses of individual records or opinions. The application of the coefficient of correlation has made possible an empirical testing of the inheritance of mental traits, of the old controversy as to the value of general training or of formal discipline under the form of the transfer of training, and of the interrelations between many functions or capacities, innate or acquired. The methods for determining standards</page><page sequence="3">58 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. from the opinions of a number of people have made possible standardization of grades and the determination of the progress through training. These same methods have given results in all sorts of problems in general and applied psychology. For the development and application of this method, Cattell and Thorndike and their students have contributed most. In addition to these results from special methods particular problems both in teaching and studying have received much benefit from researches in general psychology. Studies of read- ing and writing, made to determine the general laws of per- ception and of motor activity, have given results that suggested practical applications. Studies of memory, of thinking, of animal learning, and of attention have given information that has been applied in practical ways. Educational theory has also profited or might profit from the newer results. Many of the hypotheses that were affirmed dogmatically a quarter of a century ago have been altogether refuted by these results; a few only have been confirmed in a modified form. Most of the problems in educational theory and practice have been affected by the experimental method,-either solved or modified in statement,- at the same time that many new problems have been raised. In psychiatry and mental pathology psychology has provided new methods and has changed the attitude toward many of the problems. Down to the beginning of the period under dis- cussion the psychiatrist had depended upon unaided observation for diagnosis, and his explanations were primarily in terms of nervous pathology, the latter in spite of the fact that for some of the diseases there was and still is no direct evidence of brain injury. From this time on more attention is paid to the mental causes, explanations are given in mental terms, and one hears more of mental laws. About this time, too, laboratories were established in hospitals for the investigation of the mental operations of patients and mental tests began to be called to the aid of observation. The first of these laboratories was founded by Kraepelin at Heidelberg, but this was soon followed by the establishment of one at McLean hospital and later at Washing- ton. As a result of the work of these institutions and of others</page><page sequence="4">No. I.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 59 working independently, tests have -been developed that are rapidly making the diagnosis of mental diseases as accurate as that which has become possible in the earlier developed clinical branches. The mutual relations between psychology and the clinically developed theory and practice in hysteria and related diseases offer much of interest. Here the advances in medicine have been most clearly reflected in psychological theory, and earlier psycho- logical results and the general attitude of the science have most influenced clinical practice and theory. It was only a little before the period we are discussing that Janet began to publish his striking books. His conclusions he himself traces to the combined work of Charcot on the clinical side and to Ribot on the psychological side. The studies of hypnotism played prob- ably the most important r6le in developing his theory, but these also were interpreted in the light of purely psychological fact and theory. The concept of dissociation arises naturally from the notion of association. This is fundamental in the explanation Janet gives of hysteria. When specific evidence for the existence of such a phenomenon was discovered in pathological cases, the uses that might be made of the notion in many connections, particularly in the explanation of the self phenomena, became evident. The more recent theory of Freud and its modification by Jung, while it raises more controversial questions of a psychological character, can still be traced to psychological considerations. Freud's theory, too, goes back for its first formulation to a period about a quarter of a century ago. The assumption of a sub- conscious or unconscious can be traced to Schopenhauer and von Hartmann, although they had another purpose in assuming its existence. The struggle of the ideas below the threshold to enter consciousness is reminiscent of Herbart, while one may assert that to find the real forces in consciousness in personifica- tions, in ideas that act as separate forces, has been a tendency manifest from the earliest animism to the present time. On the other hand the notion of dissociation in its most fundamental forms and the theory that dissociated ideas take on peculiar</page><page sequence="5">6o THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. force are an adaptation from Janet and his predecessors. What- ever its origin, we have in Freudianism the assertion that the determining forces in consciousness are below the conscious level,-in the unconscious rather than in the conscious,-that these are ideas that have been forced into the subconscious as a result of some emotional shock and that they are at all times striving to penetrate consciousness against the influence of the ordinary ideas. The entire assumption that one should look to actual ideas somewhere outside of the field of consciousness for an explanation of mental phenomena is opposed to the notions of current psychology. In the first place it must be objected that the content of the subconscious or unconscious cannot be ideational in character. Consciousness and awareness are identical. What one is not aware of cannot be conscious. In the second place the assumption that it is unusual for the antecedents of mental states to be themselves unconscious is entirely contrary to fact. It is seldom that one knows in advance what is to come into con- sciousness. Many times the general trend is anticipated, but the specific idea is seldom or never foreseen. The causal ante- cedents of conscious processes are for the most part nervous, not mental. Even from analogy there is no reason to assume that sudden breaks in the train of consciousness need be explained by other conscious processes. Physiological or neural processes alone would suffice. The great disadvantage of the kind of explanation offered by the Freudian theory is that it is forever removed from observation and the theory can be neither proved nor refuted. One may gain an explanation for all of the observed facts by substituting the word neural or cerebral for subconscious and at the same time avoid unnecessary assumptions. That these explanations of the known by the unknown tend to introduce a reckless multiplication of hypotheses is seen in some of the more manifest absurdities of the school. Leaving aside the assumption that all of the disturbing suppressed ideas or complexes are of sexual origin,-an assumption that has been frequently questioned on the basis of fact by physicians of other schools who have an equal chance for the observation of actual</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 6I cases,-it is evident that the hypothesis that the particular disturbance must be due to a complex of a preconceived sort is held to in spite of the facts. When the desired complex cannot be found, it is assumed that the worker is wrong rather than the theory at fault. Even weaker is the evidence for symbolism. In terms of the theory the complex that causes the trouble is always striving to enter consciousness in the same conscious way in which the small boy struggles to get under the circus tent. The prudery of consciousness is constantly on guard as a censor to keep it from appearing. As it cannot escape observation in the more wakeful moments and in its real form, it takes advantage of the censor's being off guard in sleep to present itself as a dream, or in the waking life it takes on some disguise and presents itself in consciousness as an innocent idea which is nevertheless a symbol of the harmful memory or event. Both the evidence that all dreams are significant of the character of the subconscious complex and the arguments given for symbolism are of a kind that could be made to prove almost any statement. The idea asserted to be a symbol is nearly always one that is very frequent in the experience of every man, normal as well as abnormal. Similarly the complex is always one of frequent occurrence in hysterical patients. It is fairly easy to demonstrate that any patient with a given complex will also have the symbol. The converse conclusion that any individual who shows the symbol also has the complex is not so safe. Mill's second canon may be recommended to the Freudians in this connection. The extension of the theory to the interpretation of myths,-the assumption that the symbols assumed to represent complexes in an hysterical patient also represent similar things in the myth,-rests upon an assumption doubly attenuated. The strongest argument advanced for the truth of the theory is that it works in practice. Undoubtedly very many cures have been made by the method of psycho-analysis and similar modes of treatment that have been developed by the Freudians. Whether these cures are due to the reasons assigned by the school or cult is not so certain. It must be remembered that the methods of treatment involve giving the patient much more</page><page sequence="7">62 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. time, consideration, and sympathy than has been usual in medical practice, and in consequence many strong suggestions. These treatments through suggestion have always been successful whether given by the exorcist, the Christian Scientist, or the physician. The actually observed symptoms and methods of cure might as readily be expressed in neural terms as in terms of consciousness or subconsciousness. However, whatever may be thought of the theory itself, it has done more than any other movement to impress the physician with the advantages of the psychological methods and attitudes. In the discovery of the complexes use has been made of several methods borrowed or adapted from the psychological laboratory. Jung's association method, which interprets a delay in the response made to some word shown to indicate the presence of a complex, and the delay itself as the result of the emotional disturbance, excited by the concealed idea, is an ingenious development of psychological experiments. The galvano-psychic method, while psychological in spirit and in application, was developed most completely in the diagnosis of hysteria. On the whole this particular branch of mental pathology has con- tributed more to psychology than psychology has contributed to it. It must be asserted that the discussion of hysteria and Freudianism in particular has raised more problems than it has settled, but the facts themselves, and the theory of dissociation in its general forms find many analogies in normal psychology and explain many facts. Perhaps the most direct influence of psychology in any practical field, certainly in the field of pathology, has been through the development of tests of intelligence. Attempts to develop tests have been made from the beginning of experimental work, and while many of the individual tests suggested early were as good or better than those used later, it was not until a common standard was proposed that any were generally applied. The standard generally accepted was suggested by Binet and Simon in I905. The characteristic of the method lay first in deter- mining what children of different ages could accomplish in differ- ent tests and then in comparing the accomplishments of patients</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 63 and other individuals with them. It provided at once a scale and a test, and in consequence was generally adopted. While the tests are by no means perfect and suggestions for improving them are constantly being made, they do provide a point of departure and have proved very valuable when used with caution and intelligence. The scale has been successfully applied to the detection and measurement of mental defectives in many different relations. First they were applied iri the schools to discover the children who did not have sufficient ability to profit by the ordinary work. These could then be isolated and given special training in work that they could master. Many school problems yielded at once to the mere elimination of the unfit. More generally interesting was the discovery that much of crime and poverty was also the result of lack of mental development. Tests of criminals show that twenty to fifty per cent. of the individuals who pass through reform institutions are mentally subnormal. They are less than twelve in mental age. While their instincts are fully developed, the normal control is very much reduced. Evidently the usual forms of punishment and prevention can not be successfully applied to them. The discovery that much of crime and poverty is rooted in mental incapacity has already had an influence upon the treatment of many social problems, and when its meaning is fully appreciated it will make possible many important reforms in more than one field. In the realm of pure science the development of animal psy- chology is the most important phenomenon in the outlying fields. Thorndike's first paper in I898 may well be regarded as epoch making in this field as it marked the first of a series of experi- mental studies upon animal activities. He first applied experi- ment to this form of animal investigation in any thorough way. He showed that chicks, cats, and dogs learn by a slow process of trial and errors that the animal first hit upon the correct move- ment by chance and only after many repetitions did it develop the chance movement into a habit that would cause it to be made at once when the problem was presented. This conclusion has been confirmed for many animals from the crayfish to the</page><page sequence="9">64 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. anthropoid ape and for all sorts of problems, although opening doors and running through mazes have been most used. While these problems of learning have held the most prominent place, much progress has been made, particularly in the most recent times, in studying the sensory processes of animals. The degrees of sensitivity to different light waves, the sensitivity to chemical stimuli and to sound have been tested upon a wide range of animals. The development of instincts and the relation between instinct and training have been carefully and in many cases conclusively determined. Imitation seems to have been largely eliminated as an explanation of any but conscious learn- ing. Conclusions on both of these problems can apparently be transferred to man with tio appreciable change in their formula- tion, but they can be worked out on animals with much greater certainty. One of the most important general problems for animal psy- chology and for general interest is the question of whether animals think or, in 'the more general form, whether and 'to what extent one may ascribe something like human conscious- ness to the lower animals. This problem has been prominent in the minds of philosophers from a very early period. It seems to have been more or less overtly conscious when the modern experimental work began. Of the biological workers, Loeb attempted to mark off a line between higher and lower animals by demonstrating that the activities of lower organisms could be explained in purely physical and chemical terms. Like plants they were said to possess tropisms only, while the higher organism must be more like man and act through associative memory. Bethe made the statement for the lower organisms more definite in the assertion that certain physico-chemical pro- cesses, surface tension, osmosis, and more strictly chemical reactions were sufficient to explain all activities of animals up to and including ants. Jennings attempted to confirm Bethe's results, but early came to the conclusion that the assumption that physical and chemical processes alone were needed for the explanation of the activities was not justified even for unicellular animals. In some of the lowest he detected</page><page sequence="10">No. i.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 65 signs of learning in the simplest form, the modification of acts as a result of earlier activities. At the same time he found no reason to assume that any consciousness accompanies the move- ment. He suggested the term behavior to designate this form of action. The term has been commonly accepted and extended to cover the activity of the higher organisms as well, since viewed from the outside they too show merely an increasing complexity in the same kind of action. At no point can one be sure that a new type of control is introduced. This concept of behavior has proved very useful. It serves to distinguish organic from inorganic activities, the activities of the organism as a whole from the actions of different organs which are discussed by the physiologist, although both physical and chemical processes and the action of the parts are assumed to be necessary for the action of the whole. At the same time it implies nothing as to the presence of consciousness. Acts are explained in terms of instincts and the previous experience of the individual, rather than by physiology or chemistry on the one side or by mental states on the other. It is interesting to note that there is a marked difference in the conclusions drawn from these observations with reference to the problem of consciousness. While all would agree that the problem of consciousness should not be raised with reference to the lower organisms, one school, led by Watson, does not stop with the assertion that it is indifferent for the animal psychologist whether mental states are or are not present, but asserts a posi- tive negative. Yerkes on the contrary believes that the problem of the existence of consciousness should be raised for the higher animals and that it must be answered in the affirmative. Watson from introspection and probably under the influence of the imageless thought doctrine and neo-realism insists that con- sciousness has no existence in man or in animals, that all activity, human as well as animal, must be explained from the outside. Yerkes on the other hand not only accepts the commonly held belief in human consciousness, but is satisfied that images play a part in the control of the action of the higher animals. The fact that actions may be delayed beyond the time of stimulation</page><page sequence="11">66 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVIL and the similarity of many animal acts to those accompanied in man by consciousness convince him that consciousness must be assumed to explain their acts. Either theory is consistent with its premises, and here as elsewhere choice of premises seems to depend in part upon individual peculiarities. Whether one pictures man after the nature of animals or animals after the nature of man seems largely a question of individual taste. In many practical fields psychological investigations are beginning to find application. The first of these to develop any degree of importance, the psychology of advertising, began by formulating the results of general psychology as they might affect the special problems of catching attention, of producing an impression which might be remembered or bring out the response of buying. More recently experimental study of the problems with actual advertising material and under natural conditions has been made. This has made it possible to solve certain of the advertising problems in the laboratory. The Aussage studies of Stern have given results with a direct bearing upon the reliability of testimony, and, after a first rejection because of too strong claims on the part of its supporters, seem to have had an effect upon the legal theory of evidence. With the development of mental tests for the lower grades of intelligence there has also come an application of methods to the discrimination of higher grades of mental capacity and these are beginning to find application in selecting men for the occupa- tions. Telephone girls, clerks and stenographers and even sales- men are selected in part on the basis of psychological tests. The psychologist might dream of a society in which each individual should be measured and assigned to the place for which he is best fitted, and then instructed in the best and most economical use of his capacity in the performance of the task that has been given him. The realization of such a dream, if such realization be desirable, implies a very great advance in our present knowl- edge, of course, and also demands great tact and good sense of the workers in the practical field. Exaggerated claims always arouse opposition and set back the time when even well deter- mined results shall be given application. Meantime there are</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 67 many problems in every day life which can be solved by psycho- logical methods already developed, and many others in which the errors that would be made by those methods are much less than those made daily by the present rule of thumb solutions. Our discussion has been limited to the changes that have been taking place in the outskirts of psychology, but many of these changes have been associated with movements that have been going on in the more central problems. In some cases one may trace the cause and in others the effects in the more general field. But in practically every case changes in point of view in one department have influenced the others. The most striking phenomenon in general theory has been the relatively slight change in twenty-five years, the persistence of opposing or con- tradictory theories, and the capacity of different men for drawing opposite conclusions from the same premises and the same ob- served facts. Through the quarter century there has been little or no tendency towards a common standpoint. If anything the opposing general principles are more firmly held and are more clear cut than they were at the beginning of the period. We may divide all forms of explanation into two groups, the ani- mistic and the causal. The one seeks the final explanation in a single force that is often given an anthropomorphic form; the other is only content when each element has been reduced to some other element, itself more completely known than the first. We find that both types have persisted, perhaps with an increase in the animistic during the period. If we accept these as the two most general points of view, we find that neither has been abandoned at any time and that there have been many fluctuations in the degree of acceptance of each. Cases are numerous in which there has been adherence to one or the other of the schools where it would be least expected. Thus, the explanation of the Freudians is definitely animistic, although the natural tendency of the neurologist or physician is towards a causal, even a mechanical theory. The complexes are described as plotting to enter consciousness, to escape the censor, and as units that think as elements and are independent of the total self. As stated by its holders this view is almost</page><page sequence="13">68 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. on a level with the mythical explanations of natural phenomena in terms of concealed gods or giants. It is the more surprising as the observed facts may be quite as easily stated in neurological terms and the explanations would be quite as effective in those terms. A more conscious animism is seen in MacDougall and of course in Bergson. This attitude seems quite as foreign to the earlier work and premises of the former as it does to the Freudians. Within the field of general psychology we find a very curious difference of opinion concerning the explanation to be given for the so-called imageless thought, perhaps the most discussed of all recent problems. The believers in imageless thought as a unique phenomenon have divided sharply into two schools. One takes what seems to be a completely animistic position. The thinking operations are carried on in a realm above the observed consciousness and even seem to be the products of a super-conscious activity as the complexes of the Freudians are of a sub-conscious activity. At least it is an operation that is subject to no known laws and has an authority higher than that of the normal consciousness. By the other school consciousness is denied all existence and the explanation of all so-called mental processes is to be found in the physical or physiological. If these highest operations require no consciousness obviously the simple processes of every day life need none. Consciousness can be wiped off the slate altogether and all acts traced to forms of behavior. The processes that suffice for the animal suffice also for man. Thus the conclusions of behaviorism and of intro- spection mutually support each other. Animism and material- ism are each inferred from the same set of facts. It should of course be insisted that between the extremes of animism and behaviorism, there is another possible explanation, that still held by the majority of psychologists. This is the explanation of mental states in terms of other mental states. Just how these states are related to the neural processes is not asserted, but the antecedent that is observed and given a causal character is mental not physical. This is as much opposed to animism as is behaviorism. The choice of one rather than another of these</page><page sequence="14">No. I.] NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 69 general principles of explanation seems so little related either to the known facts or to the earlier experience of the psychologist that it can hardly be regarded as other than arbitrary. As one compares the psychology of the present with the psychology at the time the REVIEW was founded, one sees that the advance, great as it is, has not been in the line of develop- ment of a single system or even in a tendency to accept a common view-point. Rather has it been in the accumulation of facts in an ever widening domain and in the development of complete or partial explanations of separate problems. In general it may be said that less emphasis is now put upon description and classification of mental states and more upon the causal or dynamic explanation of mental activities and accomplishments. During the whole period the changes have come as a gradual growth, there have been no revolutionary discoveries, and most of the great changes in point of view that were proclaimed or proclaimed themselves to be epoch making have with time proved to be less striking and of less importance than they seemed at first sight.
