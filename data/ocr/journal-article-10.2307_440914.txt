<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward Butscher Wallace Stevens' Neglected Fugue: "Variations on a Summer Day" It is in a poet's obsessions that we usually locate his poetic center. Thus, Robert Lowell's intense concern with sin and the redemptive potential of Puritan- ism, and the hellish fires of earthly madness, become the prime, if not pri- mordial, source of much of his stark imagery of decay, while Hart Crane's major effort, "The Bridge," is vitalized in its carefully ordered leaps towards mythical wholeness by the fragmented nature of the author's own self-concept, its limitations and genius. As might be expected from such a learned and sophisticated gentleman, Wallace Stevens' obsession was an intellectually com- plex one that revolved around the problem-not unlike Crane's in kind, though worlds apart in metaphorical degree-of reaching the conscious core of creation through the very implements and techniques of that creation. In other words, Stevens' entire thrust towards a poetic expression of his imaginative reality was a deliberate paradox of intention and material. He was striving for nothing less than an ultimate art experience, wherein the existential universe would be made subordinate to a metaphorical one, if not replaced by it altogether, which is, perhaps, the logical direction for any truly sensual artifice to take. Without the benefit of religious or mystical states of consciousness, the artist must utilize the reality at hand to achieve ultimate transcendence. To understand what is meant by this, and to appreciate the audacious nobility (and terrible despair) behind the attempt, we should investigate in some detail one of the poet's most successful and least appreciated longer works, "Varia- tions on a Summer Day."' Before approaching the poem itself, however, it 153</page><page sequence="2">Twentieth Century Literature might be wise to first turn to a stimulating essay by Northrop Frye entitled "Anagogic Phase: Symbol as Monad," in which he tries to move beyond arche- typal poetry and criticism to a description and, hopefully, definition of the essential modes of communication necessary in any "self-contained literary universe.". According to Professor Frye, the two elemental vehicles of literary com- prehension are myth and ritual, described, respectively, as "universal symbols" and "limitations of nature," which are seen as forever tending towards the central monad of all poetic existence: "a single infinite and eternal verbal sym- bol" capable of traversing innate human boundaries (i.e. empirical and bio- logical factors) and external human constructs (i.e. scientific and philosophical laws). Religion, of course, took the initial step in the direction of anagogy,3 and its remaining literary products can still operate effectively for believers and unconsciously, through archetypes, for non-believers, when assimilated by an imaginative mind. Often using identical or slightly variant myths and rituals, secular poetry must also mount an unavoidable ladder of literal, allegorical and moral meanings to the monad where the word becomes the thing named and the reality of language is the sole reality left. In poetry, however, the progress towards such a wide-open perceptual framework cannot, perhaps should not, partake of the same mystical surrender- ing of reason almost inevitably implied in a complete religious experience or trance. Although he does not discuss it specifically, I am certain Professor Frye would agree since he does stress the importance of both Logos and Mythos being present in his final formulation of the monad and, more significantly, takes care to limit the relationship between poetry and religion to a vague methodological awareness of man's capacity for predicating his thoughts and actions upon an infinite hypothesis in which literature looms 'larger than life' at every turn. Stevens, too, would probably concur and, in "The Man with the Blue Guitar" (167), went much further, envisioning poetry as a potent spiritual substitute for "empty heaven and its hymns." He even seemed to have created an anthropomorphic parallel for Frye's monad in "the glass man," that convoluted termination of "Asides on the Oboe" (250), and of all his previous poems.4 And yet, as a modern, secular, post-symbolist poet, Stevens' main attention focused on conveying the ontology of his monad, on the practical aesthetics of how to best articulate and duplicate his personal insights into the sublime. The search, then, was for symbols and metaphors powerful enough to suggest and express through their own oral being, the fabulous goal to be accomplished. It had to be an abstraction, to be sure, but it also had to be "blooded," breath- ing with a vital poetic and sensual life that could shape the supreme fiction, the anagogic reality, into an independent world of imagination." Humor, ironic and playful, dominated the tone of that quest in Harmonium, his first collection. 154</page><page sequence="3">Stevens' Neglected Fugue There, when the artist manifested himself in dramatic form, it was under the protective guise of the comic, Crispin, or the buffoon, Peter Quince, while many other poems in the same collection betrayed a whimsical remoteness that bordered on pure satire. Religion was rejected repeatedly for becoming a stuffy storehouse of obsolete myths and icons, despite the clear affirmation of the essential power of religious feelings demonstrated in "Sunday Morning" (66) and "To the One of Fictive Music" (87). The painter and his gaudy palette obviously prevailed in this initial volume, but music also quietly and con- sistently began to assume a position of extreme relevance. It surfaced in "Le Monocle de Mon Oncle" (13) and "0 Florida, Venereal Soil" (47), among others, and instruments such as the mandoline and guitar served as crucial similes for romantic longings and exotic settings, with guitars being posited as the only means for "The Ordinary Women" (10) to rise above their "poverty."'; Furthermore, music was the central metaphor for "Jasmine's Beau- tiful Thoughts Underneath the Willow" (79) and became poetry itself, quite directly, in "To the One of Fictive Music." Also, if the poet was Crispin in "The Comedian as Letter C" (26-45), and I believe he was, in a generic and ideal sense, he similarly assumed the role of "orchestra leader" on a number of occasions, and Peter Quince, after all, constructed Susanna's "bawdy" elegy upon a delicate clavier and conceived of beauty's immortality in terms of "the clear viol of her memory."7 Thus, whenever music was introduced by Stevens, it was generally projected as the most efficient, most immediate means of realizing his special poetic reality within the reader, of removing the vast distance between the tactile world of the reader's mundane reality and the analogical senses his language- bound imagination was endeavoring so mightily to generate. Why music should be used in this way is not difficult to understand. Almost by definition, it re- mains the abstract art par excellence, free of linguistic barriers and visual his- tories to the point where form equals content, at least on the innocent surface. It attracted Stevens not only because, like Ezra Pound, he early recognized poetry's innate need of and tendency to return to musical phrasings and formulas, but because it came closest to imitating the complex lyric monad he was constantly seeking. Appealing strongly to both mind and senses, it could fashion an artifice without having to make any categorical statements (rhetorical or narrative) about its connections, however tenuous at times, to the physical universe. Stevens utilized music-oriented metaphors in his second volume, Ideas of Order, to unify the two self-absorbed poems, "The Idea of Order at Key West" (128-9) and "Mozart, 1935" (131-2), that most strik- ingly exhibit his fascination with the very act of writing poetry and, in "Evening Without Angels" (136-7), again metamorphasized the poet into an "Eternal chef d'orchestre." Even more indicative, the title poem from his third collec- tion, The Man with the Blue Guitar, returns to the idea of poet as musician and goes on to explain in detail, through elaborations upon this primary conceit, his personal conception of the poet's main purpose, to play "A tune beyond us, yet ourselves," and of his close interaction with both material and reader. 155</page><page sequence="4">Twentieth Century Literature All of which leads to "Variations on a Summer Day" (232-5), a kind of penultimate attempt by Stevens to paraphrase a musical composition that would structurally re-inforce his material's obsession with the imagination's higher reality. Unlike Randall Jarrell, who had hastily condemned Stevens for being an aesthetician engaged in repetitive exercises and had, like many other critics, believed that no single poem in Parts of a World could stand beside "the best in Harmonium,"s I am convinced that "Variations on a Summer Day" com- pares favorably with anything else ever composed by its author. It is, indeed, one of those golden few works in which Stevens happily found a suitable vehicle for his great emotional and intellectual energies, as well as for his obsession with a transcendental aesthetic." The vivid images of the poem, its relaxed lyrical phrasing and imaginative metaphors, combine with the solid musical structure of its tragic undercurrents to produce a moving portrait of a sensitive, creative soul confronted by harsh fate: his own mortality and a concrete world still beyond his control. Much of the poem's undeniable strength stems from its melodious organization upon the principal features of a fugue, that musical form that develops one or two major themes contrapuntally from a polyphonic base and introduces different voices along the way in a con- tinuous testing of extremes. The title itself, of course, supplies evidence to support the contention that this is a musically conceived production, but further clues can be found internally, textually, as well, in stanzas 2, 7 and 8-the stanzas are numbered- where music is an immediate reference, and in the careful arrangement of all the stanzas to correspond to the major themes of a fugue: they emerge through the continuous, often dramatic exploitation of contrapuntal tensions, with a constant weaving back and forth between childhood and apparent old age, between the magical fabrications of adolescence and the same imaginative function in an accomplished artist, the poet himself. The three-line stanzas, 3, 5, 8, 13, 17, 18 and 19, concentrate upon an ordinary, quite literal setting, a man studying the beach, and act always in terms of a present tense, though the time covered seems more than a day, while the more speculative, less linear alternating stanzas (of varying lengths) deal with the past and/or an imagined future. The three stanzas preceding the last one, 17, 18 and 19, represent a merger of the present with the past and future, form echoing content, and lead, structurally and thematically, to the mixed resolution of the twentieth stanza where the distant ship's "grasp of transparence" fails before the realiza- tion that "It was not yet the hour to be dauntlessly leaping," a rueful con- clusion which still leaves the door open for the poet and ourselves. But to fully appreciate Stevens' subtle artistry, it is necessary to analyze the poem as it unfolds, as we would read it or any other poem, stitching together the various details and meanings as we go along until the final tapestry, a brilliant seascape, is revealed. 156</page><page sequence="5">Stevens' Neglected Fugue The initial stanza sets the scene, portraying a flight of gulls from the per- spective of a shore-bound observer, and immediately plays with the problem of perception, identifying the sea and sky as light and dark shades of blue. In addition, through the use of the pensive "say," Stevens reminds us firmly at the very start of the artist's conscious presence. This has the effect of moving technique closer to achievement, which is one of his major aims and basic to any serious effort at creating a viable monad. The second stanza, now that we are cognizant of the poet behind the poem, assimilates the music motif directly as "more than a breath, but less/Than the wind," which places it in the human range somewhere between the lowest life form and powerful nature, and then touches upon its psychological aspect, below speech, "repeti- tion of unconscious things," before turning to a frequent Stevens' theme: the deep, pervasive awareness of the barriers erected by language, the near impos- sibility of putting ideas into precise verbal patterns. Stanza three-one of the three-line stanzas and thus present tense- demon- strates the tremendous facility of the imagination. The observer can change rocks at will into "heads of dogs" and then into "fishes," bestowing motion and life upon inanimate objects through the metaphorical techniques of the poet. Language alone accomplishes the miracle and shifts easily between the elements of sea and sky, linking them together as features of the same creative mind, as they are not linked together by the 'real' world. The barriers of words have become staircases to experience. The following stanza indicates a movement of awareness upwards to the stars and sounds a note of sorrow and loss, com- paring the speaker to the "Atlantic star" as a drifter, a lantern "without a bearer" that "is a will" or "the portent of a will that was." The mind here, still meditative and without specific direction, is in another phase of its opera- tion; the star symbolizes nature's will, its inexorable laws, and recalls for the speaker the nebulous (religious) past when man's will was in close contact with the materials of creation. Stanza five returns to the present scene and the metamorphosis begun in stanza three is resumed, with the edges of the sea visualized, brilliantly, as leaves, leaves that summon up a memory of another tree "that was a father." Again, the suggestion of a distant past, and a col- lective unconscious, is projected as a primitive age when philosophy, religion and art were but fused aspects of the same imagination. Under this tree, "they" had sat and "sang our songs," which implies tribal rites, early story tellers and a kind of "golden bough" theory of aesthetic originality. The primeval and ancestral memories being evoked are also possible analogues for the experience of childhood, which is, as Freud and others well knew, an acting out of our tribal evolution towards civilization and which carries with it an uncertain attitude towards the father figure. In any event, the songs have survived but there lingers that sense of lost connections, that weakening of will down the centuries as art removed itself further and further from the primary source of its energy, from nature." 157</page><page sequence="6">Twentieth Century Literature Stanza six is the most beautiful and memorable of the entire poem. It lyri- cally establishes a major theme and outlines the extreme poles of youth and old age that gives the work its main tension: It is cold to be forever young, To come to tragic shores and flow, In sapphire, round the sun-bleached stones, being, for old men, time of their time. Interestingly enough, the opposite conditions of youth and age isolated here come to the same "tragic shores," come to the limits of flesh and mind, of existence. But the true horror is the possession of a young consciousness in an aging body. This predicament, in a sense, characterizes the poet's perpetual status, since childhood's innocent belief in eternity and its own powers is what makes him a poet, helps shape and maintain his art. And yet the fundamental images of the stanza establish a sharp contrast between two distinct types of painful experience: the motion of youth (ocean flowing in) versus the reflec- tive stillness of age (sun-bleached stones), with youth having the considerable advantage of beauty (sapphire), though the strength of age resides in survival and self-awareness, the reluctant acceptance of "time of their time." The whole stanza, however, is in the present reality and is being filtered through the highly articulate observer at the beach, which means that the wisdom and tragedy is his, that the two pains are alive in him because he is the poet, speaker and archetype, and thereby capable of encompassing both realities. Easy rhythms, iambic for the most part, buttress and give added weight to the gestalt of reverie evoked and, assisted by alliteration and assonance, imitate the ocean's own relentless movements into shore. In a contrary mode of conversation, the seventh stanza denies the dual insight of the preceding stanza in favor of a definitive philosophical statement, maintaining the polyphonic base while providing another opposing process of meditation. The initial value judgment, "One sparrow is worth a thousand gulls," is deceptive in its supposed rhetorical simplicity and implied romanti- cism. For all his appreciation of William Carlos Williams, and later emotional response to Whitman," Stevens would hardly envision his artistic task in terms of a plain sparrow or as a representative mysticism in the style of Whitman's sentimental "he-bird." On the contrary, the sparrow applauded here for requit- ing one mode, "without intent," acts inside the poem as a sort of hard-headed corrective to the complexities that have already been touched upon, especially the complexities of the artist striving after a transcendental aesthetic through the deliberate manipulation of his random perceptions. The speaker is remind- ing the reader, whose existence he insists upon with the frequent use of an unspoken "you," that the first reality principal of sense data can never be ignored, must be utilized in and of itself as literal experience before any significant monad can be reached. Consequently, the sparrow's real existence, its anatomical smallness and lack of self-consciousness, represents a return to the stars in stanza four,1" a return to the physical world's inexorable, often beautiful forms and behavior outside human spheres, human influence. 158</page><page sequence="7">Stevens' Neglected Fugue Stanza eight elaborates this idea and attempts to confirm the poem's fugue- like format. "An exercise in viewing the world" relates to both the sparrow as artist and to the construction of the entire poem, delimiting their absolute place in the manifest order of things. The next two lines-"On the motive! But one looks at the sea/ As one improvises, on the piano"-amplifies the meditative technique, tries to purify intent, a resort to innocent accidents, and emphasizes once again the musical base beneath the creative act. More im- portant, as with the sparrow, the speaker refuses to accept pre-ordained (con- scious) ethical and/or professional considerations. The joy is in the doing, the thinking and creating, and not in the solving of any pedantic puzzle, despite the ironic atmosphere of academic argument summoned up by expres- sions such as "modes," "exercise" and "improvises." Being one of the three-line stanzas, this one again reasserts the present tense, reminds us of the poet's existence and of our direct participation in his evolving artifice, restating the poem's foundational conviction: poetry alone can translate the real world into a higher reality if pushed to its imaginative, but not illogical, extremes. Another three-line stanza follows, expanding on the immediate "cloudy world" by stressing its inevitable cycles of "more days, more clouds, more worlds." The latter phrase is the key because the poem must keep alive the constant possibility of many worlds, many realities, with none of the variations being more or less than the others, including the sensual here-and-now degree. Reproducing selves, echoing nature's cyclical recurrences, thus have validity in an expanding universe, which finds oral affirmation in the steady iambic beat, repeated words, balanced compound concepts, i.e. "land and sea" and "wind and quiet." As seen in stanzas three and four, where the allegorical mind pre-dominates, imaginative worlds are equal in value to the sensory worlds and childhood worlds referred to in other stanzas, whether their source is an optic nerve, a memory bank or a creative imagination. Insights or visions from the poet's inclusive eye, in other words, must assume a single final reality beyond the three worlds mentioned if it wishes to attain a metaphysical level of experi- ence, the monad. The tenth stanza makes explicit what is being hinted at in the two preceding stanzas. Shifting away from the visual for a moment, it grammatically demands, through the absence of a subject for its infinitive clauses, that its explications be linked back to the piano exercises of stanzas eight and nine and be seen as prose re-statements of the poetic movement towards transcendental vision. As such, its philosophical abstractness denies itself, "To change nature, not merely to change ideas," and obviously wants much more than mere exercises in metaphorical capabilities, wants, indeed, to "escape from the body, so to feel/ Those feelings that the body balks." To put it another way: literal, philosophical and allegorical modes are not sufficient without a corresponding metaphysical transformation in the emotional field, in the sensibilities. Stevens is talking about religious feelings, of course, though he would fervently disavow any 159</page><page sequence="8">Twentieth Century Literature mystical intentions." He desires a return, instead, to the state of mindless ecological wholeness which might have prevailed in the stone age, to a complete immersion in the impulses of life itself without the barrier of intelligence or civilization "As a boat feels when it cuts blue water." He wants his cake and eats it before our eyes. That last line and image, by the way, saves the entire stanza from dullness and returns the poem to its main task, the doing and shaping of experience, not the explaining of it. The frustration with words so evident in stanza ten, and alluded to earlier, less clearly in the second stanza, is touched upon again in the eleventh. The reference comes at the end of the stanza and involves a perfectly apt and yet perfectly prosaic simile: "The moon follows the sun like a French/ Translation of a Russian poet." Apt because quite clever, understandable and in keeping with the obsession with poetry and language evidenced throughout, but prosaic in its lack of sensory excitement and vividness. Thematically, it mobilizes time in the essence of its natural laws, shoves the poem along its temporal track, and maintains the academic facade introduced in the preceding stanza. It also fittingly demonstrates the absence of the close interaction with nature yearned for earlier, presents the poetic conceit of an intellect burdened down by layers and layers of civilized knowledge, substitutes for experience, language again acting as a barrier to absolute art values. The opening images of the stanza, however, offer a sharp analogy for a sudden association in the speaker's mind, combining memory with poetic technique, and let the reader visualize how the moon-sheened ocean flowing inward reminds him of a field of long grass once seen in Europe at Pemaquid. A further contrast-in association, a melding of opposites-is the difference ascribed between the timothy, "silver-tipped," roll- ing "in heat" while the sea appears "cold." Process breeds process. Taken as a whole, the stanza is a merger of elements, a flux of techniques and materials, that seeks to find a composite expression for both abstract and natural knowl- edge, for total awareness. It fuses memory, observation, allegory and formal education into a somewhat lame arrangement of related experiences, and, from a technical standpoint, it attempts to join the opposing melodies or themes of the three-line stanzas to their longer alternates. In this sense, it foreshadows the grand conjunction that will occur in stanzas 17, 18 and 19. The next stanza continues the process. An observation, part rhetorical. "Everywhere the spruce trees bury soldiers," leads directly (with a colon) to a specific historical incident that entailed the death of a British sergeant and his men during the American Revolution "beyond the barbican." This is a reversal of the rational trend followed in the tenth stanza, where the statement was followed by a proof, an example. The process has now become inductive, and we descend from the general condition and conclusion to a very definite instance. To complete a circle while varying the means and avoiding boredom, as in a fugue, the last line then supplies another large observation: "Everywhere spruce trees bury spruce trees." The slight variation from soldiers to other 160</page><page sequence="9">Stevens' Neglected Fugue spruce trees is the ingenuity of the polyphonic base at work. In poetic values, it keeps pace with the soft flow but does not permit the reader to be lulled asleep. However near it seems verbally, the leap is a huge one, and the two general statements are quite different in total meaning and impact. Trees burying soldiers presents a known fact of human affairs; our self-destructive tendencies and nature's brutal indifference to them and to us. Trees burying trees, on the other hand, enlarges that nature to an awesome degree, removing the human figure altogether, and recreates a primal world of remorseless destruction and renewal as implacable as time itself. The beautiful side of nature celebrated in stanza ten, its conscious-free participation in the felt ex- perience of elemental existence, is thereby exposed as having its fierce anti- human logic as well, one the poet must always be aware of and capable of absorbing into his production. That delightful, melodic phrase "beyond the barbican" adds an intriguing note. It appears to re-inforce the general con- clusion, warning men about leaving the safety of his walls, of his civilization, but it also suggests a tentative association with the poet as an "ivory tower" figure. In any event, the stanza must be challenged by the present reality, by the poet in action, and is in stanza thirteen: Cover the sea with the sand rose. Fill The sky with the radiantiana Of spray. Let all the salt be gone. Comment on this stanza would almost be superfluous. Its imperative lan- guage, its soft vowels, its persistent s sounds, all accentuate the transmutations desired by the observer at the beach, desired for him but quite real to us now that language has made it so, an accomplished reality. Again, the metaphorical process of the poet transforms nature at will and, in asking for the salt to be gone, is leaping towards that higher reality beyond the pragmatic, beyond the painful, ordinary details of reality through the painful, ordinary details of real- ity, not like the twice removed French translation of the Russian, but in direct intensities of what is there, Emerson's drop of water without the cloak of his mystical "oversoul." Having now overcome the linguistic resistance to a trans- cendental experience, Stevens can, in the next stanza, accept the opposite view, at least inside his poem, that words "add to the senses." This is a new voice, another testing of extremes in a fugue which carries along pieces of the earlier melodies and themes. In praising words, the poet naturally has to be careful in his selection of words to do it, and is: "The words for the dazzle,/ Of mica. the dithering of grass." Dithering is nearly onomatopoeic in capturing the essence of restless, wind-tossed grasses, as are the d alliterations for the mica. And, in the subsequent line, "Arachne integument" certainly is thick and clogged enough to echo "dead trees" and make vivid the web-like tangle of their moribund limbs and roots, while relating back to the burying trees in stanza twelve and once more indicating that escape from the forces of nature and man comes through the poetic process. The final line, a summary of the three previous lines, pinpoints the process as "the eye grown larger, more intense." Not different or spiritually removed, not lost in another world or paradise with different laws, but simply "larger, more intense." 161</page><page sequence="10">Twentieth Century Literature Though poetically logical, stanza fifteen is a fascinating conclusion to the process, the absurd end of the extreme. Like Dante, Stevens has difficulty in describing his paradise of poetic reality, and for the same reason: it supposedly resides beyond language, beyond the very processes used to create it. Semantics and allegory come to his rescue. He envisions a future state that contains the speaker's present, "The last island and its inhabitant," which is one answer, and then places them in perfect unity, together but still separate, "two alike, distinguish blues," bringing back the sea and sky of stanza one in such a harmony of colors and visions that "the difference between air/ And sea exists by grace alone." Where? "In objects, as white this, white that." Perfection thus comes to whiteness, stark nothingness, reminding us of Poe's ultimate vision in his "Eureka" speech. The poem should end here since poetry can go no further, but Stevens and the speaker are too sophisticated and "in the world" to be satisfied, however much they want to be. The aesthete needs his sensory perceptions, and honesty demands either death or more poetry at this point. As a result, in the following stanza, the poet can only struggle onward with his clumsy tools, seeking out the perfect metaphor for the perfect state of consciousness. He talks of a whirlpool, "round goes the bell of the water," and differentiates between that image and the actual, "round goes the water itself," in order to isolate the heart of paradise: And that which is the pitch of its motion, The bell of its dome, the patron of sound. "pitch" and "bell" and "patron" delineate no visible properties of perception, only that which is suggested by motion in the material world, respectively, an angle of degree, a metaphor and a human counterpart for natural law, unseen products of the imaginative intellect released through a delicate pattern of sounds. But the pull of the immediate experience remains too strong for such nega- tive extractions. Stanzas seventeen, eighteen and nineteen are the calmest, most self-contented of all the stanzas. They come after the act, and can relax into a glimpse of heaven in being able to use a piece of that knowledge or memory to transform what is seen on shore. If viewed in musical terms, they represent the merger of themes after a crescendo of sublime interactions that had almost reached the impossible note at the top of the scale where absolute sound and absolute silence dwell in marriage. Relaxed, anti-climactic, the stanzas proceed along the path of narrative allegory with new assurance: Pass through the door and through the walls, Those bearing balsam, its field fragrance, Pine figures bringing sleep to sleep. The motif of the spruce trees returns, but now death is softened into sleep and nature does not threaten or ignore the human, it brings beauty, peace. Simi- larly, stanza eighteen introduces a jocular tune. A point of stillness exists, a 162</page><page sequence="11">Stevens' Neglected Fugue flat point accented by bare, unimaginative adjectives: "Low tide, flat water, sultry sun." In defiance, in self-mockery, the speaker plays with his own artistic techniques, "observes profoundest shadows rolling," but he knows the limits of flesh after love has been consummated, good-humoredly encompasses the other extreme of language, alliteration of senseless syllables, the use of words for sound, not meaning: "Damariscotta da da doo." Nonsense poetry does have its own pleasures, but they originate in childhood, lead smoothly into the nineteenth stanza: One boy swims under a tub, one sits On top. Hurroo, the man-boat comes, In a man-makenesse, neater than Naples. There is no pretense at profundity, no striving for either philosophic or poetic brilliance. And yet, childhood is returning to the central theme, magnifying another aspect of the artist, who must operate constantly through his own past, his own cherished innocence. Literal fact converges with the nursery- rhyme setting as "the man-boat comes," so patently constructed for utilitarian purposes, "man-makenesse." but beautiful, imaginative just the same, "neater than Naples." hinting at flight, distance, exotic places. More important, human ingenuity is not defeated. The possibility of voyages to far horizons beckons still, if craftsmanship and dreams can continue to challenge the material world. The end of the poem comes in one of the finest stanzas. Conscious of a need for a fit symbol, as well as for a reasonable conclusion to the linear plot of the man on the beach, the speaker leaves us once again in sight of the ultimate transcendental experience though fully anchored to the real world before our eyes: You could almost see the brass on her gleaming, Not quite. The mist was to light what red Is to fire. And her mainmast tapered to nothing, Without teetering a millimeter's measure. The beads on her rails seemed to grasp at transparence. It was not yet the hour to be dauntlessly leaping. 'The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens (New York: Knopf, 1965), pp. 232-5. All future page references in parentheses are to this edition.

Besides the glass man, there was an earlier Snowman (9-10), who anticipated the poet's efforts at containing the bleak perspective of nothingness, and, in "The Idea of Order at Key West," a crucial work in Stevens' canon, the ulti- mate poetic reality is located in a vague siren figure singing "beyond the genius of the sea."

The entire essay, entitled "Reflections on Wallace Stevens," pp. 121-34, indicates a belief in the steady decline of Stevens' work after Harmonium, but remains quite positive, appreciative and perceptive in specific references. A later essay, a review of The Col- lective Poems reprinted in The Third Book of Criticism (New York: Farrar, 1969), pp. 55-76, shows a candid and generous reversal in Jarrell's attitude. Yvor Winters, in his In Defense of Reason (Denver: Swallow, 1947), pp. 433 and 446, decried Stevens' failure after Harmonium to come near greatness, "the rapid and tragic decay of the poet's style." !'One of the reasons, I believe, why Winters and, to a lesser extent, Jarrell had difficulty relating to Stevens' later poetry stemmed from their innate commitment to America's romantic tradition in poetry, a tradition which demands from poetry a basic dramatic situation or character and which contains within itself an unspoken distrust of philosophic and meditative modes. ]"The movement "back to nature" led by Coleridge and Wordsworth was, of course, but a sophisticated attempt to reassert emotional control over material which had become increasingly remote from experience in the hands of classicists. However often or deeply the English Romantics sang of the simple man and his attachment to the earth, their essential techniques and complex responses inevitably came from a highly developed sensibility centuries removed from the primitive, animistic response of their tribal ancestors. This was even more true of the later nature movement initiated by the Pre-Raphaelites. "1Again and again in his own poetry, Stevens reasserted his delight over Williams' critical and poetical attempts to deal with "the thing itself," and he insisted that the last poem in his Collected edition be "Not Ideas About the Thing But the Thing Itself" (534). As for Whitman, Stevens seemed less sure, less enthusiastic. Near the end of his life, in response to a direct question, he re-read Whitman and felt that his poetic world was disintegrating, as his historical and moral world had already disintegrated. But he was still deeply moved by Whitman when the latter wrote "naturally." See Letters of Wallace Stevens, ed.
