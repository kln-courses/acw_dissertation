<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liberal Community Ronald Dworkint This symposium considers an old problem; should conventional eth- ics be enforced through the criminal law?' We discuss the problem against the background of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Bowers v. Hardwick,2 which upheld Georgia's law making sodomy a crime against constitutional challenge. I consider the role that the concept of community might play in arguments about the enforcement of ethics. It is widely thought that liberalism as a political theory is hostile to, or anyway not sufficiently appreciative of, the value or importance of com- munity, and that liberal tolerance, which insists that it is wrong of gov- ernment to use its coercive power to enforce ethical homogeneity, undermines community. I shall try to test these assumptions. Very different arguments, using very different concepts of commu- nity, have been used to attack liberal tolerance in different. ways. I distin- guish four such arguments: The first is an argument from democratic theory which associates community with majority. In Bowers, Justice White suggested that the community has a right to use the law to support its vision of ethical decency:3 it has a right to impose its views about ethics just because it is the majority. The second is an argument of pater- nalism. It holds that in a genuine political community each citizen has a responsibility for the well-being of other members and should therefore use his political power to reform those whose defective practices will ruin their lives. The third is an argument of self-interest, broadly conceived. It condemns atomism, the view that individuals are self-sufficient unto themselves, and emphasizes the wide variety of ways-material, intellec- tual, and ethical-in which people need community. It insists that lib- eral tolerance undermines the community's ability to serve these needs. The fourth, which I shall call integration, argues that liberal tolerance depends on an illegitimate distinction between the lives of individual peo- ple within the community and the life of the community as a whole. t Professor of Jurisprudence, Oxford University; Professor of Law, New York University. 1. Throughout this essay I distinguish ethics from morality. Ethics, as I use the term, includes convictions about which kinds of lives are good or bad for a person to lead, and morality includes principles about how a person should treat other people. So the question I consider is whether a political community should use criminal law to force its members to lead what a majority deems good lives, not whether it should use the law to force them to behave justly to others. 2. 478 U.S. 186 (1986). 3. Id. at 192-96. 479</page><page sequence="2">480 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 According to this argument, the value or goodness of any individual citi- zen's life is only a reflection and function of the value of the life of the community in which he lives. So citizens, in order to make their own lives successful, must vote and work to make sure that their fellow citi- zens lead decent lives. Each of these arguments uses the concept of community in an increasingly more substantial and less reductive way. The first argument, that a democratic majority has a right to define ethical standards for all, uses community only as a shorthand symbol for a particular, numerically defined, political grouping. The second argument, which encourages paternalism, gives the concept more substance: It defines community not as just a political group, but as the dimensions of a shared and distinct responsibility. The third argument, that people need community, recog- nizes community as an entity in its own right, as a source of a wide vari- ety of influences and benefits not reducible to the contributions of particular people one by one. The fourth argument, about identification, further personifies community and describes a sense in which a political community is not only independent of, but prior to, individual citizens. In this Article, I focus on this fourth argument, partly because I have not discussed it before, but also because I find its root idea, that people should identify their own interests with those of their political commu- nity, true and valuable. Properly understood, the idea furnishes no argu- ment against liberal tolerance, and no support for Bowers. On the contrary, liberalism supplies the best interpretation of this concept of community, and liberal theory the best account of its importance. I COMMUNITY AND DEMOCRACY Some liberals have thought that liberal tolerance can be fully justi- fied by John Stuart Mill's harm principle, which holds that the state may properly restrain someone's liberty only to prevent his harming others, not himself.4 In Law, Liberty and Morality, H. L. A. Hart argued that this rules out legislation making homosexual acts criminal.5 But Hart's argument is sound only if we limit harm to physical injury to person or property. Every community has an ethical environment, and that envi- ronment makes a difference to the lives its members can lead. A commu- nity that tolerates homosexuality, and in which homosexuality has a strong presence, provides a different ethical environment from one in which homosexuality is forbidden, and some people believe themselves 4.

They find it much harder, for example, to raise their children to instincts and values of which they approve. The first argument against liberal tolerance declares that questions about the shape of a democratic community's ethical environment should be decided in accordance with the majority's will. It argues not merely that whatever decisions the political officials elected by the majority make should be accepted as law, but that these political officials should make decisions that reflect the preferences of a majority rather than any minority.6 This is substantive rather than merely procedural majoritari- anism. The argument does not assume that any minority's moral views are base or wicked, but only that when opinion divides about the proper ethical environment for a community, it is unfair to allow a minority to dictate to majority will. This assumes, however, that the contours of a community's ethical environment must be decided collectively, in a winner-take-all fashion, so that either the majority or some minority must determine, exclusively, its shape. If that assumption were true, then the argument would plainly be powerful. Some issues must, indeed, be decided in close to a winner- take-all way, and in those instances, one group's view must prevail entirely, to the total exclusion of any other. For example, whether the nation should adopt a particular version of a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). But democracy does not demand that all political decisions be winner-take-all. On the contrary, in one central sphere of life-the eco- nomic environment-justice requires exactly the opposite. The economic environment in which we live-the distribution of property and preferences that creates supply, demand, and price-affects us even more obviously than our ethical environment does. I am harmed by the fact that I own less property than I might, and that others have different tastes than I might want them to have. The economic environ- ment may frustrate my efforts to raise my children to have the values I might wish them to have; I cannot, for example, raise them to have the skills and experience of collecting Renaissance masterpieces. But even if a majority of citizens wanted to assign all economic resources to them- selves, it would not be just for them to do so. Justice requires that prop- erty be distributed in fair shares, allowing each individual person his or her fair share of influence over the economic environment. People disa- gree, of course, about what constitutes a fair share, and a good part of 6. We might object to procedural as well as substantive majoritarianism in the case of enforcing morals; we might say that such questions should be decided not by elected officials but by a constitutional court like the Supreme Court. I am not considering that procedural question in this lecture, however. See Dworkin, What is Equality, Part 4: Political Equality, 22 U.S.F. L. REV. 28- 30 (1987); Dworkin, Democracy, Equality and Constitution, forthcoming in the Alberta Law Review.</page><page sequence="4">482 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 modern political argument reflects that disagreement.7 But my present point does not depend on any particular conception of distributive justice because any remotely plausible theory will reject the principle of exclu- sive majoritarian control. If we take a parallel view of the ethical environment, then we must reject the claim that democratic theory assigns a majority complete con- trol of that environment. We must insist that the ethical environment, like the economic, be the product of the choices individual people make. Of course neither of these environments should be left completely to unregulated individual choices. We need laws to protect the economic environment from theft and monopolization, for example, and zoning regulations that respond to market externalities. These laws help insure, so far as possible, that the economic environment has the shape it would have if resources were fairly distributed and markets were perfect. The ethical environment requires regulation in the same spirit, to limit a minority's impact on the ethical environment to the impact its numbers and tastes justify. Zoning regulations which restrict the prac- tice of potentially offensive acts to special or private places serve that purpose, for example. But restricting a minority's impact on the ethical environment through zoning is very different from cheating a minority of any impact at all, which is what the majoritarian argument proposes. If we treat the ethical environment in the same way we treat the economic environment-allowing it to be fixed by individual decisions made against the background of a fair distribution of resources-then we reject the majoritarian claim that the majority has a right to eliminate whatever it finds harmful in the ethical environment. Each member of the majority has a right only to a fair impact on his environment-the same impact as any other single individual. He has no right to the envi- ronment that would make it easiest for him to raise his children to hold his favored opinions. He must try to do his best, to that end, in the environment fairness provides. Can we find any reason to treat the ethical environment differently from the economic environment? Some economic issues, such as SDI, must be decided collectively, all one way or the other, rather than as a resultant of individual forces. And our sense of integrity and fairness require us to decide some issues of principal in the same way for every- one.8 For example, officials should not aim to execute some proportion 7. In my view, fair shares are those that equalize, so far as this is possible, the opportunity costs to others of the material resources each person holds. See Dworkin, What is Equality? Part 2: Equality of Resources, 10 PHIL. &amp; PUB. AFF. 283 (1981). I restrict the opportunity-cost test to material (or, as I have sometimes said, impersonal) resources, because that test is not appropriate for personal resources like talents and health. 8. For an account of the requirement of integrity, and of the issues of principle it demands be decided the same for everyone, see R. DWORKIN, LAW'S EMPIRE (1987), especially Chapter 6. For</page><page sequence="5">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 483 of convicted murderers to match the proportion of citizens who favor capital punishment. But neither of these reasons for making some polit- ical decisions collectively provides any argument for fixing a commu- nity's ethical environment that way. There is no practical reason why that environment must be exactly what some group thinks best. And since the various individual acts and decisions that contribute to forming an ethical environment are no more the acts of government than the vari- ous individual economic decisions that fix the economic environment are, there is no question of government violating integrity by letting individu- als make these decisions in different ways. We should not subject the ethical and economic environments to different regimes of justice because they are not two distinct environ- ments, but interdependent aspects of the same one. The value of the resources someone controls is not fixed by laws of property alone, but also by other departments of law, stipulating how he can use that prop- erty. So moralistic legislation, which discriminates amongst some uses of property or leisure, always affects price and value to some degree. In some circumstances that effect is significant: morally inspired prohibi- tion laws, for example. Any plausible regime of distributive justice must therefore take into account the degree of liberty citizens have in judging when resources are fairly distributed.9 If we insist that the value of the resources people hold must be fixed by the interaction of individual choices rather than by the collective decisions of a majority, then we have already decided that the majority has no right to decide what kinds of lives everyone must lead. Once we accept that the economic and ethical environments are unified, in other words, we must accept liberal toler- ance in matters of ethics because any contrary view denies the unity. The majoritarian argument we have been considering is politically the most powerful argument against liberal tolerance. It was allowed a conspicuous place in the majority opinion in Bowers. This part of our overall discussion is therefore of considerable practical importance. But it is important to bear in mind its limits. It is aimed only at the majoritarian argument; it should not be taken as a statement of the exclu- sive ground of liberal tolerance, or as resting the entire value of liberty on an economic analogy. Nor does it purport to define any special rights to particularly important liberties, like freedom of speech or association. It only denies the majoritarian argument's essential premise that the shape of the ethical environment as a whole must be fixed winner-take-all by a more extended discussion of the distinction between matters of principle like those cited in the text, and matters of policy like SDI, see R. DWORKIN, A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE (1986), especially Chapter 3. 9. This argument is developed at considerable length, and its consequences for liberalism described, in Dworkin, What is Equality? Part 3: The Place of Liberty, 73 IOWA L. REV. 1 (1988).</page><page sequence="6">484 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 the majority's wishes. If the concept of community has an important role in the criticism of liberal tolerance, is must be in a more robust sense than simply as a name for a political unity over which majority rule roams. II COMMUNITY AND CONCERN The second communitarian argument, the argument of paternalism, appeals to the idea of community in a more robust sense. It begins in the attractive idea that a true political community must be more than a Hobbesian association for mutual benefits in which each citizen regards all others as useful means to his or her own ends; it must be an associa- tion in which each takes some special interest in the well-being of others for its own sake. The argument adds that people who are genuinely con- cerned about others take an interest in their critical as well as their voli- tional well-being. I must explain that distinction, because it is crucial to the argument of paternalism. " There are two senses in which people have interests, two ways in which their lives can go better or worse. Someone's volitional well-being is improved whenever he has or achieves something he wants." But his critical well-being is improved only by his having or achieving those things that he should want, that is, achievements or experiences that it would make his life a worse one not to want. We can make this distinc- tion subjectively, as a distinction between two ways in which a person might understand or regard his won interests. I myself, for example, consider some of the things I want very much as falling under my voli- tional interests. I want good food, and fewer visits to the dentist, and to sail better than I do, and my life therefore goes better when I have them. But I do not think that I ought to want these things, or that my life would be a poorer one if for some reason I did not. But I take a different view of other things I want: such as having a close relationship with my children, and achieving some success in my work. I do not think that having a close relationship with my children is important just because I happen to want it; on the contrary, I want it because I believe a life 10. This discussion of this section draws on material in lectures I gave last spring at Stanford University under the auspices of the Tanner Foundation. These will appear in a forthcoming collection of Tanner Foundation lectures to be published by the Foundation. Readers who wish to see an expanded discussion of the distinction between volitional and critical interests, and reasons for preferring the constitutive to the additive view of critical interests, should consult those lectures. 11. That characterization of volitional interests ignores the fact that some of the things a person wants may conflict with other things he wants. But the refinements needed to take account of that fact are not necessary for the general distinction between coalitional and critical interests I make in the text.</page><page sequence="7">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 485 without such relationships is impoverished. We make the same distinc- tion objectively, that is, as a distinction not between two ways in which people might regard these interests, but between two classes of interests people actually have. People can fail to recognize their own critical interests. It makes sense to say that someone who has no regard for friendship or religion or challenging work, for example, leads a poorer life for that reason, whether he agrees or not. We also make critical judg- ments about ourselves; people all too often come to think, toward the end, that they have ignored what they only then realize is really impor- tant to their lives.12 The distinction is complex and can be explored and criticized in many different ways. Some, for example, will be skeptical about the whole idea of critical interests or well-being. They may think that since no one can prove that it is in anyone's critical interests to want some- thing he does not, then the whole idea of critical well-being is mistaken. I shall not try to answer that skeptical objection here. I shall assume, as I believe most of us do in our ordinary lives, that we all have both kinds of interests. We can use the distinction between volitional and critical interests to distinguish two forms of paternalism. Volitional paternalism supposes that coercion can sometimes help people achieve what they already want to achieve, and is for that reason in their volitional inter- ests. Critical paternalism supposes that coercion can sometimes provide people with lives that are better than the lives they now think good and coercion is therefore sometimes in their critical interests. The second communitarian argument appeals to critical rather than volitional paternalism. It forces us to confront a philosophical issue about critical well-being. We can evaluate someone's life in two ways. We can look, first, at the components of that life: the events, experiences, associations, and achievements that make it up, and ask whether in our view these components, in the combination we find them, make a life good. We can look, second, at the attitudes of the person whose life it is. We can ask how he judges those components; we can ask whether he sought them or regards them as valuable, in short endorses them as serv- ing his critical interests. 12. The distinction between critical and volitional well-being is not the distinction between what is really in my interests and what I only think is. My volitional interests are genuine, real interests, not merely reflections of my present judgments, which I may later decide are mistakes, about where my critical interests lie. The two kinds of interests, the two modes of well-being are distinct. I can intelligibly want something without thinking it makes my life a better life to have; indeed a life in which someone only wanted what he thought it in his critical interests to have would be a sad, preposterous mess of a life. I should add (because the question was raised at the conference) that I use the term "critical interests" rather than "real interests" to avoid suggesting what this footnote denies, that the contrasting "volitional" interests are in some way illusory or bogus.</page><page sequence="8">486 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 What view should we take about the relationship between these two ways of looking at the critical value of a life? We should distinguish two answers. The additive view holds that components and endorsements are separate elements of value. If someone's life has the components of a good life, then it has critical value. If he endorses these components, then their value increases. The endorsement is frosting on the cake. But if he does not, the value of the components remains. The constitutive view, on the other hand, argues that no component contributes to the value of a life without endorsement: If a misanthrope is much loved, but disdains the love as worthless, his life is not much more valuable for the affection of others. The constitutive view is preferable for a variety of reasons. The additive view cannot explain why a good life is distinctively valuable for or to the person whose life it is. And it is implausible to think that some- one can lead a better life against the grain of his most profound ethical convictions than at peace with them. If we accept the constitutive view, then we can answer the argument from critical paternalism in what we might call its crude or direct form. Suppose someone who would lead a homosexual life does not, out of fear of punishment. If he never endorses the life he leads as superior to the life he would otherwise have led, then his life has not been improved, even in the critical sense, by the paternal- istic constraints he hates. We must recognize a more subtle aim of critical paternalism, how- ever. Suppose the state deploys a combination of constraints and induce- ments such that a homosexual is converted and does in the end endorse and appreciate the conversion. Has his life then been improved? The answer turns on an issue I have so far neglected: the conditions and cir- cumstances of genuine endorsement. There must be some constraints on endorsement; otherwise critical paternalism could always justify itself by adding chemical or electrical brainwashing to its regime. We must distinguish acceptable from unacceptable circumstances of endorsement. The distinction, as we know from the history of liberal theories of education, is a difficult one to draw, but any adequate account of acceptable circumstances would, I believe, include the following prop- osition. We would not improve someone's life, even though he endorsed the change we brought about, if the mechanisms we used to secure the change lessened his ability to consider the critical merits of the change in a reflective way. Threats of criminal punishment corrupt rather than enhance critical judgment, and even if the conversions they induce are sincere, these conversions cannot be counted as genuine in deciding</page><page sequence="9">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 487 whether the threats have improved someone's life.13 The second commu- nitarian argument is therefore self-defeating. III SELF-INTEREST AND COMMUNITY A. Material Needs It is now a familiar idea in political as well as social theory that people need communities, and that social life is both natural and essential for human beings. The third communitarian argument declares that tol- erance makes communities less able to serve their members' various social needs. In the 1950s Lord Devlin offered a straightforward, though very implausible, version of this argument in criticism of the Wolfenden Report which successfully recommended liberalization of the laws against homosexuality in Britain.14 Devlin said that a community cannot survive unless it achieves moral homogeneity backed by a sense of intui- tive outrage, and that tolerance is therefore a kind of treason.15 His claim was widely attacked and seems contradicted by the stubborn sur- vival of famously tolerant political communities such as Scandinavia.16 There are more sophisticated versions of the third argument, how- ever. These claim not that tolerance will destroy a community, root and branch, but that it will cripple a community's ability to perform some crucial function. Different versions of the argument cite different func- tions as crucial, but one set of social needs is obvious: People need secur- ity and the economic benefits of division of labor. No one could lead an adequate human life without the mechanisms of community that ration- alize production and consumption, provide public goods like police, armed forces and the like, and ameliorate prisoners' dilemmas. But there 13. I shall not consider a form of critical paternalism more subtle and academic still, though it raises difficult and important questions about the concept of critical well-being. Suppose critical paternalism is aimed not at the present generation of homosexuals, but at the remote future. Suppose it aims to eliminate homosexuality, as a form of life, from the conceptual menu, so that future generations will not even be able to imagine such a life. It is extremely doubtful such a project could succeed. But assume that it could and also (what many of us would not accept) that a homosexual life is inherently a bad life to lead. Would this kind of conceptual paternalism then be in the interests of people who would have led homosexual lives had these been on their menu? Some conceptual paternalism would certainly be in the interests of justice; the world would be a better place if no one could even imagine a life of genocide or racism, for example. Even so, it seems to me odd to think that a person's own life could be made a better life to have lived, in the critical sense, by constricting his imagination. 14. P.

Devlin himself later said that he did not mean to suggest that tolerating homosexuality would subvert the community, but only that society might be threatened by tolerance, and must therefore reject any principle that rules out intolerance altogether.

REV. 635-41 &amp; n.14 (1962).</page><page sequence="10">488 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 is no reason to think that these instrumental benefits of community require moral homogeneity. There is no evidence that an illiberal society delivers the goods or the mail more efficiently than a liberal one. B. Intellectual Needs But people depend on community in ways that go beyond these evi- dent economic and security benefits. They need a common culture and particularly a common language even to have personalities, and culture and language are social phenomena. We can have only the thoughts, and ambitions, and convictions that are possible within the vocabulary that language and culture provide, so we are all, in a patent and deep way, the creatures of the community as a whole. None of this, however, suggests that a community must be morally or in any other way homogenous in order to benefit its members in the right way. On the contrary, cultural and linguistic provision is richer, and therefore apparently more advanta- geous, in pluralistic and tolerant communities. Of course some (perhaps a great many) people want to belong to a morally homogeneous society and feel a keen sense of loss, for which we should have sympathy, when traditional ethical patterns are disturbed. But that point, though important, has nothing to do with a community's success in supplying people's intellectual needs of culture and language: It touches distributive justice, the issue raised by the first communitarian argument about the right standards to use in distributing influence over an ethical environment. Professor Sandel and others have proposed a particularly strong form of the claim that people need community for intellectual as well as material reasons.17 This argues (so far as I understand it) that people need community not only for culture and language but for identity and self-reference, because people can only identify themselves, to them- selves, as members of some community to which they belong."' So I cannot but think of myself except as an American, or an Oxford don, or a Red Sox fan. There are two ways to interpret this strong claim. One makes a point of philosophical logic: I am necessarily an American because, were I not an American, I would not be the person I am.'" But this says nothing at all about the kind of relations I must or should have with other Americans, or about the content or character of our political community. It certainly does not follow, nor does it seem plausible, that 17. M. SANDEL, LIBERALISM AND THE LIMITS OF JUSTICE (1982). 18. See id. at 62-65, 179-83. 19. Readers interested in this issue of philosophical logic should begin their reading with S. KRIPKE, NAMING AND NECESSITY (1980).</page><page sequence="11">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 489 any community I am necessarily a member of must be morally homoge- neous, or that it must reject moral pluralism in favor of intolerance, to protect that intimate connection. The second interpretation of the self-reference claim seems more pertinent. It makes a claim about phenomenological possibility: people cannot distance themselves, when thinking about their own well-being, from certain kinds of association or connection with community. A pro- foundly believing Catholic, for example, could not even begin to reflect about whether to regard her Catholicism as important because Catholi- cism would be too far constitutive of her personality to make questions of that character sensible for her. This interpretation of the third communi- tarian argument runs as follows. In a community that is morally homo- geneous, people identify with the shared morality in just the way that a devout Catholic identifies with Catholicism. The community, for them, is a community of shared beliefs that helps constitute their own identity. If the community tolerates deviation, such citizens will suffer the shock of deracination. They will lose the connection to a moral faith that is essential to proper self-identification. The phenomenology on which this argument rests seems wrong, or at least overstated. No doubt it is impossible for someone to detach him- self from all associations and connections in considering what kind of life to lead. No one can think intelligibly about that question prescinding from every aspect of the context in which he lives. So no one can put everything about himself in question all at once. But it hardly follows that for each person there is some one connection or association so fun- damental that it cannot be detached for inspection while holding others in place. It is an even more serious mistake to think that this is true of the same association or connection for everyone, or that this universally nondetachable connection is to a shared sexual ethic, which must be shared within a political community rather than within some smaller or different community of, say, friends or co-religionists. Even if we were to accept this odd collection of assumptions in full, the argument would still be vulnerable, because it relies on a further set of doubtful assumptions about the consequences of toleration. It assumes, first, that when a political community tolerates breaches of some principle of conventional ethics or morality, this must inevitably shake the citizens' own attachment to that principle since their sense of being people is partly defined by their adherence to it. But the strength of people's convictions need not depend on the enforcement or even the popularity of those convictions in their political community. Many American Catholics are as deeply committed to their Catholicism as are most Spanish Catholics. Second, the argument assumes that if people</page><page sequence="12">490 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 become detached from formerly unquestioned convictions their personal- ity will disintegrate. But why should people not be able to reassemble their sense of identity, built around a somewhat different and more toler- ant set of conditions, when their faith in the morality they associate with their family or community is for some reason shaken? C. The Need for Objectivity So far we have considered communitarian arguments built on claims that people need the material and intellectual resources that a commu- nity provides, and that they need some attachment to community to con- stitute their identity. We must now notice a more subtle argument: people need a morally homogeneous community as a necessary concep- tual background to a moral and ethical life. They need that background because, in Professor Selznick's illuminating phrase, ethics must have an anchor-some objective standing outside the convictions of the agent- and the only possible anchor is the unquestioned, shared convictions of the agent's political community.20 The first of these two propositions, that ethics and morality must have an anchor, seems right. Our ethical experience treats the question of how to live well as a question calling for reflection and judgment, not just choice. We think it possible to be mis- taken about what sort of life is good, and that a serious mistake is a tragedy. But what does the second proposition, that a morally homogeneous community is the only possible anchor, mean? It might mean that people will only feel that their ethical and moral judgments are grounded-are true independently of their thinking them true-when their judgments are confirmed by an unquestioned, conventional morality. But people who hold unconventional, even eccentric, views are characteristically convinced that these views are objectively sound. (Indeed, the more unconventional the view the more likely its holder is to claim transcen- dent authority for it.) So we must understand the second proposition in a different way: We must understand it to mean that anyone who does claim objectivity outside convention is making a philosophical mistake. So understood, the second proposition might be thought to support the following communitarian argument. If the only available form of objec- tivity in ethics and morality is the objectivity of conventional practice, a tolerant, pluralistic community robs its members of the only possible source for the ethical and moral anchor they need. There is a difficulty evident in that argument, however. The objec- tivity people want (and assume they have) for their moral and ethical convictions is not the watered-down version this argument offers: Most 20. See Selznick, The Idea of a Communitarian Morality, 75 CALIF. L. REV. 445 (1987).</page><page sequence="13">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 491 people implicitly, if not explicitly, reject the offered anchor. Paradoxi- cally for the present argument, the single firmest part of our conventional morality, shared across every other division, is the second-order convic- tion that ethical and moral judgments cannot be made true or false by consensus, that they have force across cultural boundaries, that they are not, in short, creatures of culture or community, but rather judges of them. The wide popularity of this full-blooded objectivism does not, of course, argue for its truth or even its philosophical coherence, and I do not consider either here. My point is only that when a society develops this critical attitude, which insists that its own customs and conventions are constantly vulnerable to test and revision against some higher and more independent standard, it irretrievably forfeits the convention- rooted kind of objectivity available within a less critical, simpler community. IV INTEGRATION WITH COMMUNITY A. Integration I come finally to the fourth (and in my view the most important and interesting) communitarian argument against liberal tolerance. Liber- alism, according to many of its critics, presupposes a sharp distinction between people's own welfare or well-being and the well-being of the political community to which they belong. The fourth argument against tolerance denies that distinction. It claims that the lives of individual people and that of their community are integrated, and that the critical success of any one of their lives is an aspect of, and so is dependent on, the goodness of the community as a whole. I shall call people who accept this view (adopting a fashionable phrase) civic republicans. They take the same attitude toward the moral and ethical health of the com- munity as they do toward their own. Liberals understand the question whether the law should tolerate homosexuality as asking whether some people have the right to impose their own ethical convictions on others. Civic republicans understand it as asking whether the common life of the community, on which the critical value of their own lives depends, should be healthy or degenerate. According to the argument from integration, once the distinction between personal and communal well-being is recognized as mistaken and civic republicanism flourishes, citizens will necessarily be as con- cerned for the soundness of the community's ethical health, including the views of sexual morality that it sponsors or discourages, as for the fair- ness or generosity of its tax system or foreign-aid program. Both are aspects of the community's overall health, and an integrated citizen, who</page><page sequence="14">492 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 recognizes that his own well-being is derived from the community's well- being, must be concerned with the community's overall health, not with one selected aspect of it. This is an important argument, even though it ends in serious error. I should say at once what I regard as good in the argument, and where, in my view, it goes wrong. Its most fundamental premise is right and important: political communities have a communal life, and the success or failure of a community's communal life is part of what determines whether its members' lives are good or bad. The argu- ment's most fundamental mistake lies in misunderstanding the character of the communal life that a political community can have. The argument succumbs to anthropomorphism; it supposes that a communal life is the life of an outsize person, that it has the same shape, encounters the same moral and ethical watersheds and dilemmas, and is subject to the same standards of success and failure, as the several lives of the citizens who make it up. The illiberal force of the overall argument depends on this fallacy, which forfeits much of the advantage gained by the argument's sound and attractive premise. B. A Community's Communal Life We need, to begin, a more detailed account of what the phenomenon of integration is supposed to be. The civic republican, who recognizes that he is integrated with his community, is not the same as the altruistic citizen for whom the interests of others are of capital importance. This is a crucial distinction, because the argument from integration, which we are now considering, is different from the argument of paternalism and other arguments that begin in the idea that a virtuous citizen will be concerned for the well-being of others. The argument from integration does not suppose that the good citizen will be concerned for the well- being of fellow citizens; it argues that he must be concerned for his own well-being, and that, just in virtue of that concern, he must take an inter- est in the moral life of the community of which he is a member. So the integrated citizen differs from the altruistic citizen, and we need some further distinctions to see how and why. We associate actions with what I shall call a unit of agency: the person or group or entity treated as the author of and held responsible for the action. We normally consider ourselves, as individuals, to be the agency unit of-and only of-actions or decisions we initiate or take on our own. I take myself to be responsible for only what I do. I take no pride or satisfaction or remorse or shame in what you do, no matter how interested I might be in your life or in its consequences. Often a person directs his actions at his own well-being, in either a volitional or critical sense. The unit of agency and what we might call the unit of the agent's concern are then identical. When someone acts altruistically, whether</page><page sequence="15">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 493 out of charity or a sense of justice, he continues to regard himself as the unit of agency, but the unit of his concern migrates or expands. Pater- nalism, including moral paternalism, is a sub-case of altruism. If I believe that homosexuals lead degraded lives, I might think that I act in their interests when I campaign for laws making their conduct criminal. Integration is a different phenomenon, according to the argument I am considering, because it supposes that the appropriate unit of agency, for some actions affecting the well-being of an individual, is not the indi- vidual but some community to which he belongs. He belongs to that unit of agency ethically: He shares in the success or failure of acts or achieve- ments or practices which may be completely independent of anything he himself, considered as an individual, has done. Some examples are famil- iar; many Germans born well after World War II feel shame, and a responsibility to compensate, for Nazi atrocities, for instance. John Rawls offers, in a slightly different context, an example that is much more illuminating for our purposes.21 A healthy orchestra is itself a unit of agency. The various musicians who compose it are exhilarated, in the way personal triumph exhilarates, not by the quality or brilliance of their individual contributions, but by the performance of the orchestra as a whole. It is the orchestra that succeeds or fails, and the success or failure of that community is the success or failure of each of its members. So integration is strikingly different from altruism and paternalism. It is also different from vicarious or indirect pride or regret. When par- ents take pride in the achievements of their children, or friends rejoice in each other's success, or brothers (in some cultures) are dishonored by a sister's shame, the unit of agency-the actor whose acts have brought pride or rejoicing or dishonor-remains individual. The vicarious emo- tion is second order and parasitic; the success or failure, achievement or disgrace, remains primarily and distinctly that of someone else, and the vicarious concern reflects not participation in any act but a particular connection with the actor. The argument from integration escapes the objection I made to the second, paternalistic argument because it rejects the whole structure of agency and concern on which the paternalistic argument rests. The argument from integration forbids us to think in Millian terms about whether we intervene to protect other people, or only the agent himself, from some harm the agent's conduct inflicts. It rejects that whole, indi- viduated way of thinking. Its unit of agency is the community itself, and it only asks how the community's decisions about liberty and regulation will affect the community's life and character. It insists that citizens' 21. J. RAWLS, A THEORY OF JUSTICE 520-29 (1971).</page><page sequence="16">494 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 lives are bound up in their communal life, and that there can be no pri- vate accounting of the critical success or failure of their individual lives one by one. So the personification latent in the idea of integration is genuine and deep. The more familiar ideas of altruism, paternalism, and vicarious emotion are built around individual units of agency and con- cern. Integration supposes a very different structure of concepts, in which the community, and not the individual, is fundamental. All this may suggest that integration depends on a baroque meta- physics which holds that communities are fundamental entities in the universe and that individual human beings are only abstractions or illu- sions. But integration can be understood in a different way, as depending not on the ontological primacy of the community, but on ordinary and familiar facts about the social practices that human beings develop. An orchestra has a collective life not because it is ontologically more funda- mental than its members, but secure of their practices and attitudes. They recognize a personified unit of agency in which they no longer fig- ure as individuals, but as components; the community's collective life consists in the activities they treat as constituting its collective life. I shall call this interpretation of integration, which assumes that integra- tion depends on social practices and attitudes, the practice view, to dis- tinguish it from the metaphysical view which assumes that integration depends on the ontological primacy of community. I do not mean to suggest that the practice view is reductionist. When an integrated com- munity exists, the statements citizens make within it, about its success or failure, are not simply statistical summaries of their own successes or failures as individuals. An integrated community has interests and con- cerns of its own-its own life to lead. Integration and community are genuine phenomena, even on the practice view. But on that view they are created by and embedded in attitudes and practices, and do not pre- cede them. On the practice view, therefore, a special kind of case must be made before integration can be claimed. It must be shown that social practice has in fact created a composite unit of agency. It would be nonsense for someone to claim integration with some community or institution by per- sonal fiat, that is, simply by declaring and believing that he is part of it. I cannot just declare myself integrated with the Berlin Symphony Orches- tra and thereafter share in that institution's triumphs and occasional lapses. Nor can I bring a common unit of agency into existence by fiat. I may declare and believe, for example, that philosophers whose surname starts with "D" are a common unit of agency in philosophical work, and that I can properly take pride and credit in Donald Davidson's and Michael Dummett's work the way a cymbal player can take pride and credit in his orchestra's performance. But I would be wrong. There</page><page sequence="17">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 495 must already be a common unit of agency, to which I am already attached, for it to be appropriate for me to regard myself as ethically integrated with its actions. So the argument from integration must rely on some theory about how collective units of agency are established, and how individual mem- bership in them is fixed. On the metaphysical view of integration, collec- tive units of agency just exist: They are more real than their members. But on the practice view collective units of agency are not primitive; they are constituted by social practices and attitudes, and anyone defending this view of integration must identify and describe these practices. Our orchestra example is instructive, because it indicates the features that provide a common unit of agency in central or paradigmatic cases. First, collective agency presupposes acts socially denominated as collective, that is, acts identified and individuated as those of a community as a whole rather than of members of the community as individuals. An orchestral performance is treated as a collective act, in that sense, both by its members and by the community as a whole. Second, the individual acts that constitute collective acts are concerted. They are performed self-consciously, as contributing to the collective act, rather than as iso- lated acts that happen to coincide in some way. The orchestra performs a particular concerto only when its members play with a cooperative intention; it would not perform at all if its musicians played exactly the notes assigned to them in the score, at exactly the designated moments, and in the same room, but with no intention of playing together as an orchestra. Third, the composition of the community-who is treated as a member of it-is tailored to its collective acts, so that a community's collective acts explain its composition, and vice versa. Since an orchestra is a common unit of agency for the production of music, its members are musicians. The collective acts of a community constitute its communal life. On the metaphysical view of integration, a community is a super-person, and its collective life embodies all the features and dimensions of a human life. But the practice view defines a community's communal life more narrowly: it includes only the acts treated as collective by the practices and attitudes that create the community as a collective agent. The com- munal life of an orchestra is limited to producing orchestral music: it is only a musical life. This fact determines the character and limits of the ethical integration of the musicians' lives into the communal life. The musicians treat their performances together as the performance of their orchestra personified, and they share in its triumphs and failures as their own. But they do not suppose that the orchestra also has a sex life, in some way composed of the sexual activities of its members. Or that it has headaches, or high blood pressure, or responsibilities of friendship, or</page><page sequence="18">496 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 crises over whether it should care less about music and take up photogra- phy instead. Though the first violinist may be concerned about a col- league's sexual habits or deviance, this is concern for a friend that reflects altruism, not self-concern for any composite unit of agency which includes him. His moral integrity is not compromised by the drummer's adultery. C. A Political Community's Communal Life How far can we regard a political community-a nation or a state- as having a communal life on the practice view? The formal political acts of a political community-the acts of its government through its legisla- tive, executive, and judicial institutions-meet all the conditions of col- lective agency we identified when we considered why an orchestra has a communal life. Our practices identify these formal political acts as acts of a distinct legal person rather than of some collection of individual citizens. The United States, rather than particular officials and soldiers, fought a war in Vietnam. The United States, rather than particular offi- cials or citizens, imposes taxes at particular rates, distributes some of the funds it collects in welfare programs, and declines to distribute funds for other programs. Though the acts of particular people-votes of mem- bers of Congress, for example, and commands of generals-constitute these collective acts, this is only because these officials act self-con- sciously under a constitutional structure that transforms their individual behavior into national decisions. There is at least a rough fit, moreover, between the membership of a decent, democratic political community and those formal collective acts. In a creditable democracy, every citizen who reaches a certain age and meets other conditions can participate indirectly in formal political decisions by voting, speaking, lobbying, demonstrating, and so forth.22 And the citizens of a political community are those who are particularly affected by its formal political acts. So treating the legislative, executive, and judicial decisions as a political community's communal acts helps to explain the community's composi- tion; it is composed of those who play some role in those decisions and who are most directly affected by them. That much seems relatively uncontroversial. If a community has a communal life at all, its formal political decisions must be part of that life. But we must ask what else, in addition to those formal political acts, 22. I do not mean, of course, that these participatory acts are themselves collective acts of the political community as a whole: They are not. But they may be collective acts of some smaller community within it; a demonstration, for example, may be part of the communal life of a political action group, which, though political in its aims, is not in itself a political community because it does not administer its affairs through a monopoly of coercive power over its members.</page><page sequence="19">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 497 is part of its communal life. The communitarian argument from integra- tion which we are exploring claims that formal political acts do not exhaust the nation's communal life. The argument supposes that the political community also has a communal sex life. It supposes that the sexual activities of individual citizens somehow combine into a national sex life in the way in which the performances of individual musicians combine into an orchestral performance, or the distinct acts of the citi- zens and officials of a political community combine in legislation. For only if this were true could one citizen's life be defiled by the sexual prac- tices of another. If we accept the anthropomorphic, metaphysical view of the polit- ical community, then we can begin, at least, to persuade ourselves that a state or nation has a sex life towards which the sexual activity of individ- ual citizens contributes in some mysterious way. But if we insist instead on the practice view, then the argument from integration must defend the proposition that the community has a sex life in a very different way. It must show that our social practices and attitudes and conventions in fact create and recognize a national sexual act. You will have anticipated my judgment about that project. Consider the three features we identified as supporting the claim of a communal musical life in the case of an orches- tra. None of them is satisfied for the claim of a national sex life. Our conventions recognize no distinctly collective national sexual activity. When we speak of a nation's sexual preferences and habits we speak sta- tistically, not, as in the case of an orchestra's performance, of some col- lective achievement or disgrace.23 Nor do we have conventions or practices that provide structures for cooperative sexual activity on a national scale, in the way our constitution provides a mechanism for electing presidents. Nor is the composition of a political community in any way related to the idea that its communal life has a sexual side. The criteria of citi- zenship can neither explain nor be explained by the assumption of any collective sexual venture. Citizens are by and large born into their polit- ical communities and most have no real prospect of leaving the one they are born into.24 People of every race, faith, and ambition are often born into the same political community, and it is deeply implausible that the characterization of communal life that best fits such a community could be one that assumes that it must choose one faith or set of personal ambi- tions or ethnic allegiance, or one set of standards of sexual responsibility, 23. Of course, as I emphasize later, that is not to say that no community does or could recognize a collective sex act. 24. Citizens are not mutually self-selected, like members of a fraternal organization, nor are they chosen for some particular talent or ambition, like musicians in an orchestra, nor are they identified by some independently given religious faith or sexual conviction or even, in the modern world of immigration and boundary shifts, by racial or ethnic or linguistic type or background.</page><page sequence="20">498 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 as a healthy individual person must. That characterization not only does not fit the criteria of citizenship; it makes them close to nonsensical. Perhaps we cannot rule out, a priori, the possibility that some other social grounds might be found to support the claim that a nation has a collective sex life-grounds very different from those to which we natu- rally appeal in explaining why a symphony or a piece of legislation is a collective, communal act. But I cannot see what those other grounds could be. If none can be suggested, then the communitarian argument from integration can succeed, if at all, only by falling back on the anthropomorphic view of a political community most readers would be anxious to disavow. I should add two clarifications here. First, I have not claimed that there are no communities whose collective life have a sexual aspect. There are all kinds of communities-there are associations of stamp fanatics who engage in collective projects of collection, for example-and some might be in the nature of sexual rather than musical orchestras. It has been suggested, for example, that some families do-and that others might-see themselves as communities for propagation, in which case the sexual acts of family members might well be seen as collective in the sense that the integration argument assumes. My point is only that neither the United States nor its several states are communities that have a communal sex life, and that the argument from integration, used to justify illiberal political decisions by and across those political communi- ties, accordingly fails. Second, I have not considered the argument that the members of a political community should develop whatever practices would be needed in order that it would then be true that the community had a collective sex life. I have no idea how such an argument could be defended or made to seem plausible. Someone might say, for example, that people should try to expand the communal life of their political community because the phenomenological sensation of integration is itself desirable in the way some people think sensual pleasure or the exhilaration of dan- ger is desirable. But if the value of integration lies in a particular sensa- tion, it would hardly be necessary to seek integration with a political community to achieve it. People belong to a variety of communities and most people can belong to many more if they choose. They belong-or may belong-to families, neighborhood, alumni groups, fraternal associations, factories, colleges, teams, orchestras, ethnic groups, expatri- ate communities, and so forth. So there would be ample opportunity for people to have whatever degree of the experience of integration they might think valuable without having to seek that experience in the polit- ical community, where it is inevitably harder to secure. In any case, however, the argument that we should try to create a community with a</page><page sequence="21">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 499 collective sex life is very different from the integration argument we have been considering. For the latter argument begins in, and draws its force from, the claim that we are already in such a community-that we have no choice now but to look after the sex life of others because if their lives are degraded, ours are too.25 V LIBERAL COMMUNITY A. Liberal Civic Republicans The illiberal argument from integration assumes that a political community has a life that includes a sex life. This assumption is half right. A political community does have a life, but not that life. If so, the argument from integration collapses as a critique of liberal tolerance in sexual matters. I shall now explore the part of the argument that is right: its important underlying premise that political integration is of great eth- ical importance. I shall try to show that, although liberals have not emphasized the ethical importance of integration, recognizing its impor- tance does not threaten, but rather nourishes, liberal principles. First, I must caution against a misreading of my argument so far. I have not said that people should not fully identify with their own polit- ical community, or that full identification is impossible because its condi- tions cannot be met. I have argued rather for a particular view of what identifying with community means. Citizens identify with their political community when they recognize that the community has a communal life, and that the success or failure of their own lives is ethically depen- dent on the success or failure of that communal life. So what counts as full identification depends on what the communal life is understood to be. The liberal view of integration I shall describe takes a limited view of the dimensions of a political community's communal life. But it is not therefore a watered-down conception of identification with community. It is a full, genuine, intense conception exactly because it is discrimina- tory. Those who argue that identification with community requires illib- eral legislation are not arguing for a deeper level of identification than liberalism allows. They only argue for a different account of what a com- munity's collective life really is. If the liberal account is correct, and theirs is wrong, liberalism provides a more genuine form of identification than its critics can. 25. It does not follow, of course, from my claim that ethical integration is possible only when social practices create the necessary conceptual background, that ethical integration is mandatory or even defensible on every occasion when they do. No one should think his own critical interests tied to the success or failure of a community that does not recognize him as an equal member, or that denies him the most basic human rights, for example. Compare, in this connection, the parallel conditions of political obligations discussed in R. DWORKIN, LAW'S EMPIRE, supra note 8.</page><page sequence="22">500 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 What then is the communal life of a political community? I said that the collective life of a political community includes its official polit- ical acts: legislation, adjudication, enforcement, and the other executive functions of government. An integrated citizen will count his commu- nity's success or failure in these formal political acts as resonating in his own life, as improving or diminishing it. On the liberal view, nothing more should be added. These formal political acts of the community as a whole should be taken to exhaust the communal life of a political body, so that citizens are understood to act together, as a collective, only in that structured way. This view of a political community's communal life will seem too meager to many, and it is not necessary to the argument for liberal tolerance I have been developing. But it is worth exploring why the meager view might be enough after all. The idea that a community's collective life is only its formal political life appears disappointing because it seems to emasculate the idea of inte- gration, to leave it with no work to do. The idea that people's lives should be seen as integrated with the life of their community suggests, at first sight, an exciting expansion of political theory. It seems to promise a politics devoted to advancing the collective good as well as, or perhaps instead of, protecting individual rights. The anthropomorphic concep- tion of communal life-that the life of the community reflects all parts of the lives of individuals including their sexual choices and preferences- appears to fulfill that promise. It claims that an integrated citizen will reject liberal tolerance in favor of a commitment to healthy sexual stan- dards imposed on all, because caring for community means caring that its life be good as well as just. But my suggestion-that communal life is limited to political activities-does not expand political justification beyond what liberals already accept. If the life of a community is limited to formal political decisions, if the critical success of a community there- fore depends only on the success or failure of its legislative, executive, and adjudicative decisions, then we can accept the ethical primacy of the community's life without abandoning or compromising liberal tolerance and neutrality about the good life. We simply repeat that success at political decisions requires tolerance. Of course that proposition can be and has been challenged.26 The argument for integration presents a new challenge to those for liberal tolerance, however, only if it assumes an anthropomorphic picture of community, or at least one that includes more than the community's purely formal political activities. If we limit a political community's communal life to its formal political decisions, integration offers no threat to liberal principles, and it seems disap- pointing exactly for that reason. 26. It is challenged, for example, by the first three communitarian arguments I discussed earlier in this essay.</page><page sequence="23">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 501 It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that integration is an idea of no consequence, that it adds nothing to political morality. A citi- zen who identifies with the political community, by accepting the com- munity's ethical priority, will offer no new arguments about the justice or wisdom of any political decision. He will, however, take a very different attitude towards politics. We can see the difference by contrasting his attitude, not with the selfish individual of invisible-hand fantasies, but with the person supposed to be the paragon of liberalism by its critics, the person who rejects integration but is moved by a sense of justice. That person will vote and work and lobby, only for the political decisions he believes justice demands. He will nevertheless draw a sharp line between what justice requires of him and the critical success of his own life. He will not count his own life as any less successful if, in spite of his best efforts, his community accepts great economic inequality, or racial or other forms of unfair discrimination, or unjust constraints on individ- ual freedom.27 The integrated liberal will not separate his private and public lives in that way. He will count his own life as diminished-a less good life than he might have had-if he lives in an unjust community, no matter how hard he has tried to make it just. That fusion of political morality and critical self-interest seems to me to be the true nerve of civic republican- ism, the important way in which individual citizens should merge their interests and personality into political community. It states a distinctly liberal ideal, one that flourishes only within a liberal society. I cannot assure you, of course, that a society of integrated citizens will inevitably achieve a more just society than a non-integrated community would. Injustice is the upshot of too many other factors-of failures of energy or industry, of weakness of the will, of philosophical error. A community of people who accept integration in this sense will always have one important advantage over communities whose citizens deny integration. An integrated citizen accepts that the value of his own life depends on the success of his community in treating everyone with equal concern. Suppose this sense is public and transparent: everyone understands that everyone else shares that attitude. Then the commu- nity will have an important source of stability and legitimacy even though its members disagree greatly about what justice is. They will share an understanding that politics is a joint venture in a particularly strong sense: that everyone, of every conviction and economic level, has a personal stake-a strong personal stake for someone with a lively sense of his critical interests-in justice not only for himself but for everyone else as well. That understanding provides a powerful bond underlying 27. Unless, of course, he is himself the victim of these various forms of discrimination.</page><page sequence="24">502 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 77:479 even the most heated argument over particular policies and principles. People who think of justice in the non-integrated way, as requiring neces- sary compromises of their own interests for the sake of others, will tend to suspect that those who resist programs that require evident sacrifices from them, because they reject the conception of justice on which those programs are based, act out of self-interested bias, whether deliberate or subconscious. Political argument will then degenerate into the sullen trading that destroys civic republicanism. That kind of suspicion has no place to root among people who take political disagreement to be disagreement, not about what sacrifices are required from each, but about how to serve the common interests of all in securing a genuinely just solution. Disagreement persists against that background, as it is desirable that it should. But it is a healthy disagree- ment among partners whose interests coalesce, who know that they are not antagonists in interest, who know that they win or lose together. Integration, so understood, gives a fresh meaning to the old idea of a commonweal, a genuine interest people share in politics, even when polit- ical disagreements are profound. Of course all this is utopian. We can scarcely hope that a thoroughly integrated political society will ever be realized. It will not be realized in coming decades. But we are now exploring utopia, an ideal of community we can define, defend, and per- haps even grope our way towards, in good moral and metaphysical conscience. B. Ethical Priority The consequences of civic republicanism in the liberal mode are therefore attractive. But there is a considerable gap in the argument I have offered you, because I have offered no reason, so far, why people should accept integration in the liberal sense, why they should regard the success of their lives as dependent, in the way I just described, on the justice of their community's political decisions. We cannot hope to pro- vide a knock-down demonstration by way of answer to that question. But we can try to make the idea of liberal community more attractive by identifying aspects of the good life that are made possible or are nour- ished in a just state.28 I shall describe only one strand of that project- and that in skeletal form. It begins in a weak form of Plato's view that morality and well- being are interdependent in an adequate ethics, that someone who does not behave in a just way leads a worse life in consequence.29 That is hardly a plausible view if we have in mind what I call volitional well- 28. The skeletal (and I fear somewhat cryptic) discussion of this section also borrows from, and is much expanded in, the lectures described supra note 10. 29. See PLATO, THE REPUBLIC.</page><page sequence="25">1989] LIBERAL COMMUNITY 503 being. There seems no inherent connection between my being just and my having what I want. But Plato's view seems more plausible when we have critical well-being in mind. The criteria of a life good in the critical sense cannot be defined acontextually, as if the same standards held for all people in all stages of history. Someone lives well when he responds appropriately to his circumstances. The ethical question is not how should human beings live, but how should someone in my position live? A great deal turns, therefore, on how my position is to be defined, and it seems compelling that justice should figure in the description. The ethi- cal question becomes: what is a good life for someone entitled to the share of resources I am entitled to have? And against that background Plato's view of critical success is appealing. Someone does pro tanto a poorer job of living-responds pro tanto more poorly to his circum- stances-if he acts unjustly. We need not accept the strong view that Plato in fact defended, that no one ever profits from injustice. Perhaps the great lives of some artists would not have been possible in a fully just society, and it would not follow that they had bad lives. But it does follow that it counts against the goodness of any life, even theirs, that it was supported by injustice. Now notice what might seem to be a contradiction between two eth- ical ideals most of us embrace. The first dominates our private lives. We believe we have particular responsibilities towards those with whom we have special relationships: ourselves, our family, friends, and colleagues. We spend more of our time and other resources on them than on stran- gers, and we think this right. We believe that someone who showed equal concern for all members of his political community, in his private life, would be defective. The second ideal dominates our political life. The just citizen, in his political life, insists on equal concern for all. He votes and works for policies that he thinks treat every citizen as an equal. He shows no more concern, in choosing among candidates and pro- grams, for himself or his own family than for people who are only statis- tics to him. A competent overall ethics must reconcile these two ideals. They can be reconciled adequately, however, only when politics actually suc- ceeds in distributing resources in the way justice requires. If a just distri- bution has been secured, then the resources people control are morally as well as legally theirs; using them as they wish, and as special attachments and projects require, in no way derogates from their recognizing that all citizens are entitled to a just share. But when injustice is substantial, people who are drawn to both the ideals-of personal projects and attachments on the one hand and equality of political concern on the other-are placed in a kind of ethical dilemma. They must compromise</page><page sequence="26">504 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW one of the two ideals, and each direction of compromise impairs the criti- cal success of their lives. Acting justly is not entirely a passive matter; it means not only not cheating, but also doing what one can to reduce injustice. So someone acts unjustly when he fails to devote resources he knows he is not entitled to have to the needs of those who have less. That failure will hardly be redeemed by occasional charity, limited and arbitrary in the way charity inevitably is. So if the critical value of a life is diminished by a failure to act as justice requires, then it is diminished by ignoring the injustice in one's own political community. A life entirely devoted to reducing injus- tice so far as one can, on the other hand, would be at least equally dimin- ished. When injustice is substantial and pervasive in a political community, any private citizen who accepts a personal responsibility to do whatever he possibly can to repair it will end by denying himself the personal projects and attachments, as well as the pleasures and frivolities, that are essential to a decent and rewarding life. So someone with a vivid sense of his own critical interests is inevita- bly thwarted when his community fails in its responsibilities of justice, and this is so even when he, for his own part, has done all he personally can to encourage it to succeed. Each of us shares that powerful reason for wanting our community to be a just one. A just society is a prerequi- site for a life that respects both of two ideals, neither of which should be abandoned. So our private lives, our success or failure in leading the lives people like us should have, are in that limited but powerful way parasitic on our success together in politics. Political community has that ethical primacy over our individual lives.</page></plain_text>
