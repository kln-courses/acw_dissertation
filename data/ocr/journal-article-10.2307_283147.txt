These words, pronounced by the supreme authority of Athena at the end of the Ion and echoed in the solemn last sentence of the chorus, sum up the final issue of this play. Even Creusa, who seems to have some reason for complaint against the god, emphatically recognizes his care and recants her passionate previous charges: aiC.o 4?o'ZOOV OVK at'voivaa irpizv (1609f.), and, when doing so, has the strong approval of Athena: f17E' OVEK' ye' &amp;z'v bterafaXov7a (1614). This is the spirit of the last scene. It makes it worth while to reconsider whether we shall not find much more of this positive evaluation of Apollo in the whole plot of the play than is commonly admitted by the critics, who, while recognizing the patriotic spirit of the Ion, nevertheless dis- cover in it "Euripides the rationalist" with his ruthless attacks against Apollo and the Delphic oracle.'

The charges against Apollo, vehement as they are, are made, not so much because of his act of violence, as because he is thought responsible for the supposed neglect of the child and for Creusa's permanent childlessness (437f., 859f.). But Creusa's first complaint about the roX,un,uara Oac2o (252) is preceded by Hermes' report of Apollo's care for his son and by Ion's monody which is a hymn of praise for Apollo; it refutes any possible reproach by the immediate imnpression we get of Ion's holy life in the temple of his unknown, divine father. In order to achieve the main political purpose of the play, recognition of Apollo as Ion's father in place of Xuthus, it would have been enough to mention Apollo's union with Creusa without further particulars. If Euripides, in the prologue (11), lays stress on the violation, we must ask whether, really, this was not just one of his ways of attacking the traditional conception of the gods from the standpoint of an advanced morality. As generally agreed, Euripides' genuine feeling for the glory of Athens stands behind the gift of a divine father to that ancestor whose very name, " Ion," rang in the ears of the contemporaries as a political watchword, and the magic power of which as warranting his claims as Krf-TrWp 'Aoa'bos xOovos is expressly traced back to the will of Apollo (74, 81). Would it not be a strange procedure if Euripides had represented this divine father as a doubtful character, descent from whom would be much more of a disgrace than descent from a brave human hero? Euripides, the representative poet of an age much experienced in the complexity of phenomena and of characters and which was fond of approaching things human and divine from different points of view, sees in the act of violence only one aspect of Apollo's character, counterbalanced, however, from the very beginning, by his care for his child and finally also for the child's mother. In Hermes' report we have Apollo's own words, a positive assertion of his paternity-fim6s -yap cOTL . . . 6 ra-Ls (35)-and of the ensuing duty to protect the son. The repeated objection against his putting r&amp;s o1or's rpoyn6Las wrapos (448, cf. 877, 952) strikes the wrong key,</page><page sequence="3">Vol. lxxi] Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion 589 just because the element of rpomnOLa is as inherent and necessary in his character as the elements of 'bop'4 and 3t'a. A union between a god and a human woman is an extraordinary event. For a noble family, a dynasty, or a nation this relation represents the highest degree of nobility and a confirmation of national claims and prestige.2 Creusa is very conscious, in pain and joy (1293f., 1463f.), of representing her house and the ruling dynasty of Athens, and even the most tragic situation in the drama, her attempt on the life of her unknown son, is closely connected with this motive (cf. 810f.); and so, at least in her intention to keep the supposed foreign intruder out, Creusa is justified by Athenian national feeling, as represented by the chorus (719f., 1048f.).3 Apollo's choice of Creusa, as the mother of his son, demonstrates his favor toward her and his appreciation of her outstanding per- sonal and social qualities as the only survivor of the old earthborn family (279). Her dignified appearance (237f.), which recalls the models of female dignity on Attic tombstones, explains this selection which one may call a political marriage ad maiorem gloriam of her family and country. The question whether she likes it or not, does not count in a society with a definitely inferior status of women. There is no individual choice and no love either when her father later gives her in marriage to Xuthus, Sop6s -yspas, as she herself explains (298). But for a poet, concerned with the values of personality and also female individuality, there arises the problem of what this expe- rience may mean from the point of view of the rX1,uPwp yvz'7 (cf. 252), who is destined to be the god's bride and the mother of his son. While ceasing to be only a means of bringing down the grace of the god to her family, Creusa is, however, far from beco ming an inde- pendent and self-centered personality in the modern sense.4 She will rather learn to understand her fate less as passive suffering than as a necessary sacrifice for future grandeur and happiness (cf. 1540f., 1609f.). *The god cannot declare his love and ask the girl whether she likes him. Will and action coincide for him.5 In a tremendous 2 Cf. the significant words of Cadmus to Pentheus about the dynastic importance of Dionysus being considered as son of Zeus (Bacch. 333f.)

His awful majesty in the moment of begetting Ion makes him a worthy ancestor of a powerful dynasty. A Greek god of this period has no ascetic inhibitions. A strong virility is just one aspect of his epiphany. Like all divine char- acters in Euripidean tragedy, he combines primitive and advanced elements. His dealing with Creusa preserves the primitive violence inherent in the relations of the sexes from a time when woman was little more than property.8 Greek poetry until the New Comedy presents similar acts as a matter of course, and not even the gentleman, Xuthus, is entirely free from reproach of this kind (545f.). The intercourse with the god can be only transitory. Despite a full anthropomorphism precisely in this relation, he belongs to a different world and cannot share any human family life. He has to leave his bride and his child alone and can show his care for them only by watching and directing their actions from afar. This seeming aloofness becomes the starting point for the passionate outbursts and criticisms on the part of Creusa and Ion (253f., 348, 436f., 902f., 916f.), who judge the behavior of the god by rigid "modern" standards, but forget the limitations of their own expe- rience and the blindness of their conclusions (cf. 1500f.). The god, representing the permanent forces of a farsighted providence, while not concerned with temporary human sufferings and doubts (cf. 1615), has only his final objective in mind, the future political mission of Ion and his race. But also the seemingly forsaken and betrayed Creusa (877) eventually gets her compensation, when the same day turns the depth of despair into permanent blessing (1603). Even in this play, Euripides is too much of a tragic poet to forget that the distinction of close contact with the gods has to be bought by the turmoil of suffering and trouble (506f.).

The farsighted plans of the god require a legitimate and noble human father for Ion's later social rank. This will be achieved by Creusa's marriage to Xuthus. It is in Ion's interest that this marriage remain childless until he is advanced enough in years to return from the holy seclusion at Delphi to Athens, the place of his birth and descent and of his future active life, in order to ensure him seniority with regard to any other issue. Creusa's childlessness will now come to an end in a double sense, when Ion leaves for Athens, KOLVOP6pcV rarpl (577), as expressed by Xuthus, who, while thinking of his own intentions with regard to the newly found "son," reveals the designs of Ion's real father by the unconscious ambiguity of his words (cf. 1343, 1345). Had Creusa been informed earlier about her child's stay at Delphi, it would only have increased her difficulties when becoming Xuthus' KOVpLaLf 'aXoXoS. This status was not likely to be impaired by the intercourse with the god, which cannot be placed on the same level with a human premarital experience; and Creusa's as- sumption of the child's death makes it easier for her to hide her secret (cf. 868). After all, she has exposed the babe herself in the cave where it was begotten (17) and possibly born (951), leaving it at this place sacred to Apollo (285), as a kind of offering (cf. 965); and it would have perished but for his help, as he will have to save Ion a second time from her attempt on his life. She herself feels a certain responsibility, however excusable by reason of her plight (963). In the last scene it is a part of her recantation when she 9 Hymnic elements: solemn invocation; enumerating the qualities of the god; his epiphany and the ensuing " blessings "; the " help " of the god; the " love " of his birth- place (cf.

Furthermore, since Creusa has experienced only the violence of Apollo, she is inclined to forget his other aspects as Paian (cf. 125), as helper and savior; she replaces her initial hope in his help (965) with a stubborn doubt in even this possibility. It is important that Ion himself, in his first talk with the unknown mother, shows her doubts to be founded on weak arguments (349). It is left to her whether she will doubt, or believe in, Apollo's providence, and while enjoying extenuating circumstances, she is not entirely excused for her wrong interpretations and conclusions. In spite of de- pendence on superhuman forces, the concept of freedom and indi- viduality makes for a certain margin of free decision in thought and action, a fact which Greek tragedy endeavors to display rather than to unriddle. Greek rationalism, as opposed to any kind of miracles, reduces the direct interference of the god to a minimum. Euripides accepts and even enjoys human conditions, standards, and characters in his drama, while still preserving the mythological setting. The thrilling question for him and his audience is how legendary characters would behave when endowed with "modern" emotions and thoughts, and "modern" characters when placed in legendary situations. This interpenetration of traditional mythology and realistic psychology is both conscious and unconscious; it is this partial abandonment of what Nietzsche called the "pathos of distance," which attracted the objection of rigid critics such as Aristophanes.-1 But the ap- parent inconsistencies of the Ion are a striking example of how Euripides rejects any shallow rationalism and keeps much more in touch with religious tradition than he sometimes seems to do. It is true, Ion and Creusa are psychological studies combining individual and typical features of the later fifth century. It is as individuals that they become self-conscious and encounter the tragic implications of what in tradition had been only a factual situation. Creusa's personal destiny and her emotions and reactions appeal with a striking directness which recalls the poet's understanding of her plight and transmits his sympathy to a public which was only 10 Cf. my note, A.J.P.

Ion looks like a brother of those Attic youths in Plato's dialogues in his combining o-wqpooviv-' and av5pELa.'2 While preserving a naive boyishness, he shows a genuinely Attic precociousness and fondness for reasoning and discussing (cf. 429f., 585f., 1312f.). Due to his upbringing in the temple, and indirectly to the plan of Apollo, the opposite forces of the epoch, 4kbats and vo6,uos cooperate to make him a model of honesty and piety (612). The XarpELa in the temple is a special grace (131f., cf. 1343); the ideal way of vita contemplativa removes him equally from the trouble and seductions of life (150) and from morose unsociability (639f.). His conduct when meeting the noble visitors, Creusa and Xuthus, reveals the modesty of good breeding as well as the dignity of a servant to the god. He becomes a more natural and acceptable mouthpiece of the poet's views on life and politics than might some other Euripidean characters. His discussion with Xuthus about contemporary problems (589f.) 13 may have reminded quite a few among the spectators of analogous topics advanced by their sons caught by the modern fashion of reasoning. Ion's understanding of Attic conditions and prejudices (293, 589f., 670f.) 14 increases the sympathy of the audience and reminds us that for Euripides Ion and Creusa are not only interesting indi- viduals, but stand as well for the political inheritance and mission of the Attic empire. Their private affairs, no matter how thrilling, are overshadowed by the greater weight of dynastic and national duties, sacrifices, and glories. In addition to this, Ion and Creusa still keep their legendary part of direct and personal relation to Apollo as son and as bride. The intertwining of these three aspects, the psychological, the political, and the mythological, in the Ion 12 Cf. Owen, introd., 26f.; Gr6goire, introd., 178: "Athenien sans le savoir." 13 Ion's strong stand for democracy against tyranny (621f.) points to the con- temporary connection between Attic democracy and imperialism and to the coopera- tion between the "tyrants" of Ionia and the antidemocratic powers of Persia and Sparta.-The emphasis on the vita contemplativa (cf., F. Boll, Vita Contemplativa (Heidelberg, Winter, 1922], 5) in this and other Euripidean passages implies the rejec- tion of the success ideal of the politician and has its analogies in Aristophanes (cf. G. Murray, Aristophanes [Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1933], 143), and in political philosophy. It is no accident that Plato in one of his most striking discussions of the two opposed ideals (Gorgias 484e f.) makes use of Euripides' Antiope, a play which stands very close to the Ion (cf. Solmsen [see note 1], 410f.). 14 Owen, ad 569: "little in keeping with his years or the fact that he did not know Athens." But for an Attic audience it is a matter of course that such an intelligent boy is informed about Attic conditions.</page><page sequence="8">594 Felix Martin Wassermann [1940 is a masterly achievement, even if now and then one aspect seems to eclipse the other two. EV4PELvca and EvrEKVLa are closely interrelated (cf. 307, 469f.). It is Creusa's deepest despair when, in addition to the imagined death of the child she bore to Apollo, the god does not even seem to grant her any other children, and her individual grief is increased by the concern for the end of her old dynasty (789f.) and by the suspected low and foreign descent of the illegitimate son whom Xuthus is supposed to introduce into her house (837f., 1293f., cf. 1056f., 1069f., 1087f.). In the same way, when she has the son again, family and national pride are combined with personal joy (1463f.): airaLEbs OvKET ci/lEv OVO a`TEKVOL- 3(at EoTLov-ra, ya 69 EXEL vpavvovs av0a b' 'EpEX0Evs. Correspondingly Ion emphasizes the importance of EEVEyevLa, even before he knows his own extraction (559, 592, 1380f., 1477, 1485f.). The distinction of Creusa's noble descent is not destroyed, as she seems to think at first (cf. 268), but enhanced by becoming the mother of Apollo's son; there is no higher degree of eVTEKI'VLa for the mother nor of EYyE'EvLa for the child.'5 In addition to the unexpected joy (1448) of Ion's return, the god grants to Creusa what, with her hopes in the child's survival lost, she would have gratefully accepted as a kind of atonement (412, 425f.):16 children from her human marriage (1589). Also Xuthus, while displaced from the honor of being Ion's father, will have his own children in this way, in fulfillment of the preliminary oracle given by Trophonius in co6peration with Delphi (408f.). As a particular boon to Attic national pride, Dorus, the ancestor of the Dorians, whom tradition had known as Xuthus' brother, is made to replace Ion as Xuthus' son, and moreover from an Athenian mother. On the other hand, Ion, the patron saint of the Attic- Ionic empire, enjoys the highest possible favor from Apollo and Delphi, in contrast to the usual Doric sympathies of the oracle.17 Euripides, filling the romance of the legend with the political issues 15 It is significant that the first word which Ion addresses to Creusa in the moment she appears on the scene is -ye''at' s (237, cf. 239f.), and that he justifies her claim to have children because of her noble descent (619f.), not knowing how much this concerns his own existence. 16 OEOs -yap eio-rt, as she says in ber resigned state (428); but precisely because he is a god, his concern is not ras 7rptv 4vaXac43je a'Aaprias (426), but to bestow any future blessings on Creusa, Ion, and their country. 17 On the varying relations between Athens and Delphi during the Peloponnesian War, see Hiller von Gaertringen, Pauly-Wissowa, R.E., iv.2557f.

When he grows up as a servant of the god, this still remains the most natural explanation of his origin and is, of course, passionately discussed, after he has become Xuthus' " son " owing to the oracle's response (cf. 545f., 819, 837). He considers himself as a T6K1, a rov -yvvatKoS (325), words the unconscious ironic ambiguity of which is increased by being addressed to Creusa. But Euripides reserves the main effect of this point for the end. When Apollo's care for his son has become manifest again and again and his paternity seems to be established, it is Ion himself who expresses his doubts so decidedly (1521f.) that they cannot be removed by his mother (1546), but only by the authority of Athena as emissary of Apollo (1556f.). This doubt, aimed at the natural skepticism of the audi- ence, is a means of giving more effect to its refutation and to the final assertion of Apollo's paternity and constant providence. Apollo, the oracle god, is a master of hiding as well as of dis- closing. In contrast with the trouble produced by human attempts to conceal (cf. 429f., 666f., 1244f.) or to interpret the truth (cf. 533, 685f., 825), he knows how and when to keep secret or to reveal.20 18 Cf. in the H.F.

The truth remains hidden to men not so much by his concealment as by their mis- interpretation.22 In consequence, we have situations which are at once ironical and tragic, and they compel the god to rearrange matters in his usual indirect way. When Ion and Creusa are dis- cussing whether Apollo is obliged to reveal a truth which, for per- sonal reasons, he may prefer to hide (363f., 390f.),23 he has alreadv given his answer to Creusa's intended question by making her meet Ion in the very moment she first approaches the temple (247). To ask about what is manifest to anybody but the person most con- cerned, is again the point in Ion's dedication to Apollo of the basket which is to reveal his descent (1380f.): 'v' EVpco ,unjcv cOv ov f3ovAoyaL. This fear of low origin, by itself a proof of his inborn nobility, has an ironical touch for an audience which has seen that it is as little justified as Ion's earlier complaint of being a/Ur7TcoP ara&amp;rcop rE (109), while Apollo's union with Creusa has actually made him EL71TWcOp and ev&amp;rarcop in the highest degree, with his desire for an Athenian mother (671) fulfilled. But the real importance of this dedication is in the fact that it confirms once more how much Ion's existence is associated with, and belongs to, Apollo as his yEVcTWp warnp (136), as he calls him in his first song without being conscious of the whole personal and political import of this title. Apollo, as a representative god of the religion of the city-state, recognizes the standards of human society in which Ion must appear to be the son and heir of his traditional human father, Xuthus (cf. 576f., 1541f.); but at the same time Ion, while his true origin remains hidden, preserves the charismatic grace of his divine descent. This is the reason for the false oracle to Xuthus, in order to make him take Ion for his son (70f., 534f., 1532f.), which the expectancy of the audience ready for enjoyable or tragic facts, events, and truths, uncommon and hidden until this very hour. 21 The possible 5OXos of the oracle: 533, 585, 692. 22 E.g.: Creusa complains: 7rpos Trov Osoi3 KWXVo/iEaOa A'v ,uaOsZv a 0o1uXo,Iat (390f.), when she has just met the object of her inquiry (cf. 410f.). 23 This discussion brings up the question whether Apollo has to answer inquiries ex officio or whether his replies are favors which, for whatever reason, he is free to grant or to deny. Ion points out (what is proved by the plot) that what men really need is not words, but benevolence and help from the gods, not to be obtained by force (378f.). The elements of impersonal power and of individual will and interest, both aspects of the god, now interfere with each other, now coincide,</page><page sequence="11">Vol. lxxi] Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion 597 causes so much trouble in the play and in later criticism. The oracle god intentionally not only hides the truth, but gives a false oracle. This is one of the problematic situations in which Euripides sometimes puts his gods and heroes, and which, taken out of their context, seem to show him as a radical skeptic. We should, how- ever, keep in mind that in a non-dogmatic religion like the Greek many ways of considering the gods can co-exist side by side and that skepticism in Euripides is not a principle and, while strong in some of his passages and plays, is counterbalanced in others, to which belongs the Ion, by an equally strong emphasis laid on divine direc- tion behind human activities. Euripides deals with Xuthus' traditional paternity in a very ingenious way. On the one hand, Xuthus' claim is very emphat- ically rejected by Ion himself: rov 6' iliuoi raTrlp o-f; TavT' oiv ov -y'XWS . . . (528, cf. 520, 531f., 539, 592), and his temporary success in convincing Ion is full of irony for the spectators who are informed about the real conditions. But Apollo himself appears as the cre- ator of this tradition (69, 557, 569, 1534f., 1561f.).24 Xuthus, how- ever, remains a noble and highborn gentleman. He is, after all, ruler in Athens, husband of the Attic princess, Creusa, and the father of her other children. Even to be the foster father and educator of a divine child is a special distinction granted by the god as qL'Xos O4Xq (1535); and it is worth noting that it is Creusa who, converted to belief in Apollo's planned care, emphasizes this point (1534f., 1539f.). The n1bEZa 5OKrj0rLS (cf. 1602) that Ion is his son, is a better gift to Xuthus than the possibly unpleasant truth. It will ensure a genuinely paternal care and love for Ion and prevent Xuthus from preferring one of his own children to him. The god's delegating his interest in his son to a human father is a further instance of his having his providence act through the medium of regular human conditions and relations. During the play we are reminded repeatedly, even by Creusa, that Xuthus is only an alien (290, 813, 1297, 1299), and, for the strong patriotic feeling of Euripides and his wartime audience,25 misinformation given to him 24 Cf. Gregoire, 171. In order to emphasize this point by Creusa's answer, Eu- ripides makes Ion ask (1592): rC,s ow'v ov au-ou iraTh' E&amp;OK' a&amp;XXq rarpl, as reason for his doubt in Apollo's paternity. Here, as elsewhere, the poet has the possible questions of his audience raised and answered by his characters. 25 Cf. E. L. Hettich, A Study in Ancient Nationalism: The Testimony of Euripides (Williamsport, Bayard Press, 1933); E.

Euripides makes us keep in mind that he looks upon his audience as a popular assembly at a national festival, with group psychology working up the feeling of political and race superiority. Euripides, open-minded toward all the tendencies of his epoch, puts himself in the place of the various types of his audience, among whom, in a time of changing standards, are skeptics as well as conservatives, and all possible shades in between. Knowing more about the relations of the characters to one another and to the god, they will realize the irony of situations in which nearly every spoken word has a double meaning, one for the narrower world of the acting or suffering characters, and at the same time another for the spectator who knows about the background and the superhuman forces behind the scene.2" This irony is particu- larly striking in the first meeting of Creusa and Ion (237f.); in the scene with the pseudorecognition of Xuthus and Ion as father and son (517f.), striking for the eye as well as for the ear, because the scene takes place in front of Apollo's temple the silent majesty of which incessantly calls the attention to Ion's real father; and again, in the contest between Creusa and Ion before the final recognition. Creusa, as a suppliant, places herself expressly under the protection of the god (1285) whom she had just insulted as a mean betrayer (912); she takes refuge from the vengeance of her son by Apollo, Ion, whom she had attempted to poison, while both mother and son, not knowing their mutual relation as yet, claim their right to Apollo's protection. Behind the unconscious ambiguity of Creusa's very words (1285) appears the destiny of a woman, Ep&amp; rpa 0E4, with all that this relation implies of plight and grace. It is an achievement of the dramatic genius of Euripides that 26 For various forms of irony cf. 285, 306, 308, 311, 345, 354, 384, 439, 543, 559, 656, 659, 839, 1089,.1227, 1284, 1286, 1296, 1303, 1307, 1345. This concern with irony, which strikes modern feeling as overdone (cf. Owen, ad 1276), is one aspect of the new consciousness of the problematic and many-sided relations of X0yos and epEyov and of both the power and the ambiguity of speech. Moreover, the poet.thinks of spectators without textbooks, who, depending on their ears and eyes, have to catch everything in the moment of the performance and, therefore, require repetition and emphasis which might be boring to the reader. This ambiguity grows out of the fact that every utterance of a dramatic character is a variable blend of his three functions: to act, 1) in relation to his situation; 2) as the mouthpiece of the poet; 3) as a reflection of the spectator's sentiments and ideas.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. lxxi] Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion 599 this irony of the situation does not destroy the effects of genuine passion and emotion. Thus the spectator, like the actors, is made, temporarily at least, to forget that all these human actions in the foreground are only part of a farflung divine plan behind, and that the god, while perfectly timing his ways of action and revelation with regard to what eventually is best for all concerned, is able to use human error and suffering and even seeming counteractions or acts of indifferent servants (cf. 758f., 970f.) to serve his purpose (1615). Doubting the providence of the gods is a very common tendency at a time of a moral breakdown that gives the background to Thucydides' unparalleled chapters on psychology of revolution (3, 82f.) and to the Melian Dialogue,27 and to such Euripidean tragedies as the Troades and the Phoenissae. Some of this gloomy pessimism we find also here and there in the Ion, even though the harshness of realistic events and criticism is softened by the lofty harmony of an all-pervading romantic spirit. Surely there were enough among the spectators who took Ion's reasoning with Apollo (439f.): ird' KpaTELs, apETas 6%WKE, at its face value and forgot that the strongest objection (444) is made only hypothetically, and that Ion's very existence gainsays his arguments. In fact, the Ion presents rather an interplay of hope and doubt. To the audience, as well as to the characters of the play, the action seems to be directed at one time by the god, Ion's OECoV TrO&amp; (1456, cf. 1385, 1392), and at another, by the whims of Tyche (969, 1512f.). In the many-fold phases of the plot, the spectator will find corroboration for either belief or doubt. In the Ion, as in other tragedies, Euripides, at once open to skeptic realism and to traditional religion, represents hopeless confusion and providential order as equally important aspects of life. At the end, all the particulars, and the very occurrences and conditions which led to skepticism and indignation, will be revealed as necessary factors for the glorious issue. Enough remains of the power of Tyche, as stressed by both Creusa and Ion (1501f., 1512f.), to illustrate the turmoil governing human affairs amidst a disintegration of standards,28 when human 27 On the relations between Euripides and Thucydides, cf.

These defects increase the necessity and efficiency of Apollo's providence. He is the master of Tyche (68, 1368),29 less by opposing her than by using her for his purpose. At any time he likes he can check her, so much so that he even may -allow her influence in externals. This gives a clue to his achieving Ion's and Creusa's recognition in Delphi instead of Athens, as originally planned (71, 1563f.). This change is not proof of his weakness, but of his strength and elas- ticity, which enable him to meet such an emergency as the impend- ing murder of the mother by the son, by causing their anagnorisis on the spot; once more, not through direct interference, but rather by having the Pythia give Ion the basket in which he has been exposed (1337f.). What matters is that Ion is brought on the way to his future performances, and that Creusa gets her share in happiness, not whether the recognition takes place here or there. And in addition to that, one may say that the personal appearance of Athena before an Athenian audience, at the very slopes of the Acropolis, makes the scene become Athens (cf. 1616f.). The drama constantly plays at two different levels, and every scene expresses the human action in the foreground and the divine action in the background. There is no direct interference, and even strange occurrences, such as the meeting of the characters at the very moment required for the ultimate outcome, or the scene when f3Xaaco-a prevents (1189) and the doves disclose (1196f.) the attempt on Ion, or even the fact that, when Ion is about to leave, the Pythia gives him the basket in which she once found him (1337f.) all these occurrences are possible chance events rather than miracles, even when Apollo's cooperation is emphasized, as by the priestess (1346f., 1367f.); and the reactions of the characters to these events are masterpieces of psychology.30 29 The prayer of the chorus for the preservation of the autochthonous dynasty by a successful attack on Ion (1048f., cf. 719f.) is immediately followed by the report of the messenger who relates the failure of this attempt because of divine providence; the god, in this way, fulfills the real meaning of the prayer, by protecting the supposed intruder who actually is the genuine heir. Ion reasons (1275f.) about Creusa's asylum, which, after all, protects not only her, but himself as well, by preventing him from committing the most terrible crime. The apparent contrast between the god and Tyche-Daimon: ra roTo Oeov /IAEv Xp-oroa, rov b8 SatMovos (3apea (1374), will be resolved at the end. 30 Cooperation of human psychology and divine direction is a basic feature in tragedy, to be traced back to the Iliad.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. lxxi] Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion 601 This again leads to the steps taken by the god to ensure his ends. We may indeed consider the O3Xacunfrula as an incident occa- sioned by Apollo to make Ion pour out the poisoned wine (1 190f.), but Ion's reaction is the natural consequence of his education in the religious atmosphere of the temple, as positively stated; likewise,- his respect for Creusa's asylum at the altar, despite his doubt of her right to claim it (1312), which preserves him from causing the death of his mother. These and similar actions can be fully ex- plained psychologically; but Euripides makes us see in instances such as the natural pity of the priestess for the exposed babe (42f.) and Xuthus' not less natural suggestion to his childless wife of a Delphian pilgrimage (67, 824), the god as avvipyos (48) and o-Nu,uaxos (cf. 1271). It must have been a thrilling experience to listen to the comments of the audience in this play which seems to underline now the skeptical now the conservative view; 31 the doubts arise again and again, and yet the providence of the god is brilliantly revealed, when all hope has been given up, by what seems nearly a miracle, as the unexpected becomes true (1395, 1441, 1448, 1450). We feel Apollo's presence in the great songs of joy and despair; in Ion's monody (82f.), one of the most representative examples of Greek religious poetry; Apollo is present in the person of his son, who is still unknown to himself but known to the audience when he appears with his sacred fillets (cf. 522) and his bow like a young god; he unites his personal loyalty and thanks with the divine beauty and purity of the Delphian sunrise (which even to-day gives the great experience of harmony of nature, god, and man, which con- stitutes one dominant aspect of Greek religion). We feel Apollo's presence equally in Creusa's passionate disdain (859f.), expressing itself in front of his temple in insults which we have seen strikingly refuted by the facts, and again in her exultant joy after the anag- norisis, when she combines her thanks with the excuse for her rash 31 Euripides combines both views, not in a superficial compromise, but by trying various approaches to the understanding of the gods, without committing himself definitely. He covers the entire range of thought between Protagoras' aWvpww7ros IAheipov a7ravrvTwv and Plato's NoEs 1AE'&amp;pov a7raivTcov. Since he usually puts different possible views side by side, one single view, even when convincingly expressed from a particular aspect, cannot be taken as his "view." His opinion is rather the complexity of the divine: 7roXXda' jioppal Cov 6cauiovAwv. This does not prevent him, under certain condi- tions, from favoring one aspect very decidedly. The Ion, while not denying skeptical aspects a place in discussion, leaves no doubt that things are directed and arranged in the best way possible in this limited sphere of human conditions, emotions, and thoughts.</page><page sequence="16">602 Felix Martin Wassermann [1940 abuse (1440), when we have her exclamation: lrOWEv UOL -V4EKvpO a&amp;6OK?7Tos 8ovad (1448), where the answer is implied in the question. Apollo, then, is present in the holy atmosphere of a blessed day (421, 562, 1354), at his sacred place and in his temple which our eyes see as background throughout the play. This situation under- lines the irony of Ion's wish that his father, whom he still supposes to be Xuthus, take part in the joy of the recognition (1468f.), as in an earlier scene it turns Ion's xaZpE not, IraTEp (561), ostensibly spoken to Xuthus, while facing the temple, into a salute to his real father. He who is so omnipresent through the atmosphere and the actions of this drama does not need to appear personally at the end. The solemnity of the Ion is given relief by the epiphanies of Hermes and Athena, each of whom represents Apollo as his emissary and is related to one of his aspects. While Hermes, as speaker of the prologue, introduces a bright atmosphere of cheerfulness, as a prelude to the appearance of Ion and of a fortunate day, Athena's final epiphany, as a powerful climax, reflects Apollo's tremendous majesty and his political character. In a play composed by an Attic poet for an Attic public there could be no stronger confirma- tion of Apollo's providence than Athena's appearance and speech. Her helpful presence as Nike (457, cf. 1529) and as Apollo's sister, has been invoked for the EVTEKVLa of the Attic dynasty, and now she answers Creusa's call (1528) as irrefutable witness in face of Ion's doubt of his descent from Apollo (1521f.). Apollo himself could no more convincingly speak in his own cause than the divine virgin who, while less concerned with Apollo's past violence than are the modern critics, justifies his actions and his non-appearance with her unchallenged authority. It is not a "bad conscience which prevents Apollo from appear- ing in person.32 There is nothing for him to be ashamed of since, without being concerned with particulars of lesser consequence, he has prearranged every important fact from Ion's generation until his return to Athens as son and heir of the present ruler.33 Thus 32 Opposite views, e.g.: (see note 1 for references) Owen, introd., 31; ad 1557; Pohlenz, 430; Murray, 123; Wilamowitz, introd., 13; Lesky, 201; Matthaei, 46; Masqueray, 129: "Il est toujours prudent pour un seducteur de se tenir a 1'6cart;" Howald, 158: Apollo "macht seinen Fehler gerade im letzten Moment wieder gut;" - the god is not a repentant sinner. 33 Apollo combines his personal love for Ion as his son with his political protection of him as ancestor of the Ionians.-The contemporary sophistic movement as a link</page><page sequence="17">Vol. lxxi] Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion 603 Xuthus' &amp;vLa+pw 5' es rov 06ov (543) reveals a much more compre- hensive truth than he means to express. But for Apollo's plan, Creusa never would have come to Delphi. A repenting fifth century god would be a strange anachronism. Even for an advanced and more delicate morality which might object to his former violence, there is ample counterbalance in his enduring help and blessing for the individual characters as well as for the Attic empire. Even the avoidance of Trcv 7raipot yrEiz4ns (1558), which Athena gives as reason for his non-appearance, is rather an ultimate regard for Creusa whose joy would be troubled by her recollection of r 7raipoOE which include her sufferings as well as her insults against Apollo and the attempt on the life of his and her son. And however impressive an appearance of Apollo might have been, in a play appealing to Attic patriotism, it was to have less weight than the epiphany of Athena who for her citizens represents not only a personal divine character, but the supreme principle of their national existence. AEbaaw HaXX669' r,uav OEcV (211): this excla- mation of the chorus, while immediately referring to a work of art, points at once to her permanent presence in Delphi. So she takes part in the Ion from the first mention of the city of XpvouXcyXos Pallas (9). Continually the characters and the chorus emphasize the relation between the city goddess and the fate of the future head of the dynasty and the state. Also some apparent externals refer to her: the protective charm of the snake amulet given to the exposed babe, Ion (23); the drop of the Gorgon's blood used in the attempt to poison him (1002f.); and finally the objects in the basket which are decisive for the anagnorisis (1421, 1426, 1433). The union of Apollo with the Attic princess, and Ion's life divided between Delphi and Athens, both point to a close coopera- tion of Athena and Apollo, to the unity of the Attic-Ionic empire with the panhellenic spirit of Delphi. Apollo himself in his many- sidedness appealed to the two opposite aspects of the Athenian character, representatives of both of which formed the audience as in any popular assembly of the time; he made his appeal to the conservatives, as patron saint of the old Attic clans,34 to the demo- between Athens and Ionia, cf. Jaeger, op.cit. (see note 11), 318. About panhellenism in the Attic drama of this period cf. W. M.

The Ion was probably produced at a time when the fight for Ionia reminded the Athenians of their colonial mission and when the contemporary construction of the joint temple of Athena and Erechtheus on the Acropolis kept alive the memory of the old autochthonous dynasty.35 Under these conditions, nothing could be more appropriate than to have Athena and Apollo as common warrants of victory and domination, which once more shows the impossibility of finding an anti-Apollinian tendency in the Ion. 36 Athena, in her final speech, positively confirms Ion's right to rule as descendant of Erechtheus (1573f.).
