LANUZA Truth and Human Interest: Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.

Nietzsche One day declared there will notoriously be associated but with prophetically: my name I know my fate. One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful - of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man, I am dynamite (Nietzsche [ 1 888] 1 967). A hundred years after Nietzsche declared these statements, his work has served as dynamites that blast the ossified concepts of truth and knowledge in contemporary philosophy and sociology. Of all his philosophical quarrels with ancient and modern philosophers, the thorny question of truth has been the subject of much polemic (Grimm 1979; Granier 1977; Poellner 1998; Cox 1999). It is also in this issue of truth that Nietzsche admirers like Richard Rorty (1989) and Jacques Derrida have delved much into in order to get out of Western metaphysics. What makes Nietzsche's polemic against "truth" enigmatic is the fact that he simultaneously jettisons traditional notions Gerardo M.

Cox (1999) puts this dilemma as " that of reconciling his genealogy and perspectivism (which seem to reject the notion that there is a uniquely correct conception of the world) with his doctrines on becoming and on will to power (which seem to present just such a normative, even metaphysical, conception)" (Cox 1999:3). Recent writers, however, doubt whether Nietzsche proposed a new definition of truth (Nehamas 1985). This paper attempts to harness Nietzsche's genealogy of truth for sociology of knowledge. It is not a philosophical intervention in the altercation among Nietzscheans and anti-Nietzscheans, post-modernists and anti-post-modernists, regarding Nietzsche's epistemology or his metaphysics (latent or not)1. My aim is to explore the implications of Nietzsche's critique of traditional notions of truth and knowledge to the sociology of knowledge. Nietzsche's contributions to sociology in general, and to sociology of knowledge in particular, have been belatedly acknowledged by sociologists (see, for example, Antonio 1995; Zeitlin 1994; Turner 1982; Aspers 2007). The neglect is surprising given that Nietzsche is acknowledged as one of the masters of the "school of suspicion" that includes Marx and Freud (Ricouer 1970: 32). Among classical sociologists, Max Weber, George Simmel, Ferdinand Toennies, and Karl Mannheim standout as those who assimilated the residues of Nietzsche's critique of truth and knowledge. Yet traditional textbooks in classical sociology had skipped any mention of Nietzsche. With the exception of Werner Stark's classic The Sociology of Knowledge : An Essay in Aid of a Deeper Understanding of the History of Ideas (1958), Nietzsche's impact on sociology had been ignored by sociologists. As a result, the earlier critique of positivist understanding of knowledge (humanistic, feminist, phenomenological, existential and hermeneutic sociologies), and the concomitant construction of a post- positivist sociology of knowledge, has not benefited much from the fecund criticism raised by Nietzsche against traditional western view of knowledge. 1 Note on sexist language: Nietzsche was also a child of his time in relation to the use of sexist language. I deliberately did not correct his use of sexist language in the translation, albeit I tried to correct them in my own interpretation. 292 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="5">Much of the later criticisms raised against the traditional positivist understanding of knowledge have been derived, if not, distilled through the debates with the ghost of Nietzsche, through the works of Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Rorty, the Frankfurt School, and the post-feminism of Kristeva, Hekman, and Butler. This paper then aims to contribute to recovering the contributions of Nietzsche to the current revisions and reconstruction of the sociological understanding of knowledge and truth. To begin with, we can distinguish two possible strands of issues here. On one hand, there is the traditional question of epistemology: what is the nature of truth? On the other, the non-philosophical question about truth: how do we arrive at truth? What are the social and psychological factors that go into the production of truth? Does truth evolve through time? These latter questions are extra or quasi-philosophical questions. This distinction allows us to assert that most of the polemics surrounding Nietzsche's discussion of truth revolves around the confusion between the internalist and externalist critique of truth2. The paper focuses on the externalist side of Nietzsche's critique of truth, the main concern of the sociology of knowledge rather than the dealing with problems of epistemology and metaphysics3. Of course, radical sociologists of knowledge would argue that this distinction is bogus. Those working along the "strong program" of the sociology of knowledge can argue that the externalist critique undermines the very nature of truth4. This paper may point to that direction but only tangentially; the bulk of this paper aims at elaborating on Nietzschean 2 Traditionally logicians distinguish between the "context of justification" (logic of validation) and the "context of generation" (logic of discovery) in order to separate logical validation from non-logical, idiosyncratic formulation of a truth-claim. 3 For numerous positions, see Cox ( 1 999). 4 The strong program for the sociology of knowledge is championed by David Bloor and Barry Barnes (1996). In this program, truth itself is something subject to sociological analysis and not just errors. Feminist writers are also at the forefront of debunking the strict separation between the context of generation and the context of justification. Feminists and critical theorists LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 291</page><page sequence="6">analysis of the will to truth and not on the nature of truth itself. In the final section, the paper harnesses the consequences of such analysis for the sociological understanding of knowledge. GENEALOGY OF THE WILL TO TRUTH Untruth as the Condition of Life, Or Why Truth Is the Solution to Social Order "Life is no argument; error might be among the conditions of life," declares Nietzsche in The Gay Science (Nietzsche [ 1 882] 1 974:iii). Everything we hold dear as "truth" is nothing but mere illusions. According to my way of thinking, "truth" does not necessarily mean the opposite of error, but, in the most fundamental cases, merely the relation of different errors to each other: thus one error might be older, deeper than another, perhaps altogether ineradicable, one without which organic creatures like ourselves could not exist..." (Nietzsche 1964d: Part II, Sec. 535). Or, in his early essays, particularly in On Truth and Lies in Nonmoral Sense , truth is A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after a long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions... forgotten to be illusions... metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing ... (Nietzsche 1999). Once it is recognized that truth is something made, a mobile army of metaphors, Nietzsche insists that we recognize untruth as the condition of life itself. In Will to Power Nietzsche says, "Truth is that kind of error without which a certain species of living being cannot exist" (Nietzsche reject such separation because it immunizes scientific truth from ideological distortions. See Longino (1994). 294 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="7">1 964d: Part II, Sec. 493). Put differently, "[throughout immense stretches of time the intellect produced nothing but errors; some of them proved to be useful and preservative of the species: he who fell in with them, or inherited them, waged the battle for himself and is offspring with better success" (Nietzsche [1882] 1974: Sec. 110). Nietzsche demonstrates that human beings invented truth because it allows them to live peacefully in a community. Truth has certain social functions. By emphasizing the social and cultural functions of knowledge system, Nietzsche employs genealogy. Unlike history that records faithfully the sequence of events in the past, genealogy challenges the "will to truth" of historians. Its purpose is to bring to light the play of forces, perspectives, and forgotten power relations that shaped our current practices and institutions. So rather than asking what truth is, genealogy asks a different question: "What does truth matter to man?" to which Nietzsche provides a sociological answer: The highest and purest life is possible with the belief that one possesses the truth. Man requires belief in truth. Truth makes its appearance as a social necessity. . .The necessity for truthfulness begins with society. Otherwise man dwells within eternal concealments. The establishment of states promotes truthfulness. (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 91). In Human , All-Too-Human (Part II), Nietzsche also explains why "does man prefer the true to the untrue" (Nietzsche 1964b). The reason is that "he practices honesty in intercourse with real persons: now from habit, heredity, and training, originally because the true, like the fair and the just, is more expedient and more reputable than the untrue. For in the realm of thought it is difficult to assume a power and glory that are built on error or on falsehood" (Nietzsche 1964b:Sec. 26). People could not bear the discovery of untruth as the condition of life. It will drive them "to despair and destruction." Because, "[i]f but for an instant he could escape from the prison walls of his faith, his 'self consciousness' would be immediately destroyed. It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 291</page><page sequence="8">quite meaningless..." (Nietzsche 1999). Yet "all that is appropriate for man is belief in attainable truth, in the illusion which draws near to man and inspires him confidence." In short, "the pathos for truth" (Nietzsche 1999), while being an illusion itself, allows human beings to strive and conquer the world. Without illusions, life would be unbearable. Out of conventions people begin to make social institutions5. From these conventions truths are manufactured where people begin to distinguish between liars and truth-seekers. The liar "is a person who uses the valid designations, the words, in order to make something which unreal appear to be real" (Nietzsche 1999:). Liars are excluded from the community not much due to fraud but for the harm that it brings to the community. In his later writings, specifically Will to Power , Nietzsche advances other explanations for the invention of truth, especially logic and mathematics. Truth... is the will to classify phenomena according to definite categories.... The character of the world in the process of Becoming is not susceptible of formulation; it is "false" and "contradicts itself." Knowledge and the process of evolution exclude each other... it must be preceded by a will to make things knowable, a kind of Becoming in itself must create the illusion of Being (Nietzsche 1964d:Part II, Sec. 517). Then people eventually forget that truths are just illusions. "Being" must replace "becoming": To be able to affirm all this [absolute truths], however, they had to deceive themselves concerning their own conditions: they had to attribute to themselves impersonality and unchanging permanence, they had to mistake the nature of the philosophical individual, deny the force of the impulses in cognition, and conceive of reason generally as an entirely free and self-originating activity. . . (Nietzsche [1882] 1974). 5 The parallel here between Nietzsche's genealogy of truth and the phenomenological approach to social construction of knowledge is very striking (see Berger and Luckman 1968). 296 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="9">In people's battle against becoming or the flux of life they have to ally themselves with forgetting. "Forgetting" allows people to disregard truths are just illusions6. It is only by means of forgetfulness than man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to possess a "truth" of the grade just indicated... he will always exchange truths for illusions (Nietzsche 1999). What makes some illusions appear as closer to "truth" is not only made possible by forgetting. Neither it is due solely to logical proof, but more importantly, by rhetorical tour de force : "by means of their effects: proofs of strength" (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 47). This "proof of strength" provides "a genuine basis" upon which "errors and fancies" rest to become truths (Nietzsche 1964d:Sec. 190). These truths are ultimately deposited in traditions and customs. And tradition for Nietzsche is "a higher authority, which is obeyed, not because it commands what is useful, but merely because it commands" (Nietzsche 1911 iBook 1 , Sec. 9). Tradition preserves the sacred character of truths. "All things that endure for a long time," Nietzsche avers, "are little by little so greatly permeated by reason that their origin in unreason becomes improbable" (Nietzsche 1911:Book I, Sec. 1). In the end, "everything, therefore, was originally a custom, and whoever wished to raise himself above it, had first of all to make himself a kind of lawgiver and medicine-man, a sort of demi-god -in other words he has to create customs. . ." (Nietzsche 1911). This is the person's first nature (" The Use and Abuse of History "). Through customs human beings begin to trust their feelings -"feelings are based upon the judgments and valuations which are transmitted to us in the shape of feelings (inclinations, dislikes) - which "simply means obeying our grandfather and grandmother more than the gods within ourselves: our reason and experience" (Nietzsche 1911 :Sec. 35). Hence, "[t]he strength of conception does not... depend on their degree of truth, 6 Nietzsche in Human, All-Too-Human ("The Wanderer and His Shadow" Sec. 40) also explains the birth of morality through oblivion. Actions to be moral must be forgotten by men to have originated from pure "public utility" in order for these actions to have loftier reputation." LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 297</page><page sequence="10">but on their antiquity, their embodiment, their character as conditions of life" (Nietzsche 1974:Sec. 110). TRUTH AS PRODUCT OF PERSPECTIVES In Human, All-too, Human (Part II, Sec. 2) Nietzsche contends, "the world is not the abstract essence of an eternal reasonableness (Nietzsche 1964b)." Our perspectives must be seen as involving wholes rather than discrete experiences of facts. (Nietzsche 1964b :Sec. 11). Perspectives determine the objects as they appear to the knower. In more radical fashion, Nietzsche declares, "[t]here are many kinds of eyes. Even the Sphinx has eyes - therefore there must be many kinds of 'truths,' and consequently there can be no truth" (Nietzsche 1964d:Part II, Sec. 540). Moreover "[a]ll knowing is a process of measuring according to a criterion. Without criterion, i.e., without any limitation, there is no knowing. It is the same in the realm of intellectual forms. For example, when I ask what might be the value of knowing as such, I have to adopt some higher position, or at least one that is fixed, so that it can serve as a criterion" (Nietzsche 1 999:Sec. 99). Knowing is only possible because of the interest of the subject. When the interest of the subject, the criterion itself, is eliminated, nothing can be said of the object. Or as Nietzsche puts it, "[w]e can say nothing about the thing in itself [of Kant], for we have eliminated the standpoint of knowing. A quality exists for us, i.e., it is measured by us. If we take away the measure, what remains of the quality?" (Nietzsche 1999: Sec. 101). Even the laws of nature in this reading would be reflections of human capacity to impose order into the world. The world as such - the world-in- itself - is meaningless and possesses no intrinsic nature. Rather, "[n]ature is acquainted with neither shape nor size; only to the knower do things appear to be large or small. Nature's infinity: it has no boundaries anywhere. Only for us is anything finite" (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 123). Thus, there is no correspondence between our perspectives and the way the world actually is. Nietzsche, however, does not advocate nihilistic relativism or anything goes attitude towards co-existing irreconcilable perspectives. He simply wants to recognize the parochial character of our perspectives and yet he also wants us to let our perspectives battle with other perspectives. M# Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="11">He has a different notion of objectivity that is premised on perspectivism. In Genealogy of Morals (Third Essay, Section 12) Nietzsche provides a succinct definition of objectivity in the form of perspectivism: There is only one perspective, only a "perspective knowing"; and the more affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes. . . we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our "concept" of this thing, our "objectivity," be? (Nietzsche 1968) Nietzsche's perspectivism is neither the abandonment of the quest for truth altogether nor the embrace of relativism that is so common among post-modern writers. His perspectivism is militant in that it incorporates as many perspectives as possible. Its purpose is to accept the variegated character of knowing. TRUTH AS HISTORICAL Nietzsche argues that if people think that truth is not useful for their interests, people would still believe: "It is, of course no proof against the truth of a plant when it is clearly established that it does not contribute in any way to the recovery of sick people" (Nietzsche 1911 :V, Sec. 424). Nietzsche therefore does not strictly follow a pragmatic or purely utilitarian definition of truth7. He qualifies this by insisting that while some "illusions" may prove to be useful, they may only be useful for the preservation of decadent type of human beings (Nietzsche 1911 :Sec. 37). We read in the section "Man Alone by Himself' in Human , Ail-too Human : "There is no pre-established harmony between the promotion of truth and the welfare of mankind" (Nietzsche 1964a). This point is argued in the section "The Improvers of Mankind" in The Twilight of the Idols , 7 This is evident in Beyond Good and Evil (Part II, Sec. 38) where Nietzsche writes: "Nobody is very likely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous. ... Happiness and virtue are no arguments. . . .Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree." The measure of one's strength therefore resides in how much "truth" one can endure. LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 299</page><page sequence="12">that while morality is something that continuously breeds sick people, it is never discarded because they are considered as the truth of tradition. Yet in general, Nietzsche points out that if all truths are mere products of errors, people settle for those "errors that are less injurious to human life." . . .(W)ith the fundamental errors. . . there could be contention concerning a higher or lower degree of utility for life; and likewise where new maxims proved to be, not necessarily useful, but at least not injurious, as expressions of an intellectual impulse to play a game that was like all games innocent and happy (Nietzsche [188211974). To show the historicity of truth, Nietzsche traces the development of truth to the development of metaphors: From the sense that one is obliged to designate one thing as "red," another as "cold," and a third as "mute," there arises a moral impulse in regard to truth. The venerability, reliability, and utility of truth is something which a person demonstrates for himself from the contrast with the liar, whom no one trusts and everyone excludes (Nietzsche 1999). Metaphors are basically anthropomorphic. When a person describes the objects he perceives, "[h]e strives to understand the world as something analogous to man." For Nietzsche imitation allows human beings to copy nature more and more. Imitation starts with reception of an image that is translated continuously into thousand metaphors. In general, "[a] stimulus is felt; transmitted to related nerves; and there, in translation, repeated, etc." (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 148). Metaphoric knowledge is different from knowing. Imitation is in fact the opposite of knowing. But Nietzsche also claims, "there is no 'real' expression and no real knowing apart from metaphor" (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 149). The only difference here is that truths are often-used metaphors which conceal their origin in metaphors. They become the standard for measuring other forms of metaphors. Forgetting and habituation allow the mind to forget the original character of their most cherished truths. However it is through language that metaphors are expressed. And language misleads people into thinking that their language corresponds S00 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="13">to the way the world is. Therefore the first thing that creates truth is forgetting that language is mere convenient tool for coping with social life and the environment. This is very true in the case of the belief in the unitary and unified ego or self. The notion of ego as responsible for its actions for Nietzsche is just a misrecognition of the imaginary causes as real causes. So why do people look for causes? For the ego that causes free will? In essay The Four Great Errors , Nietzsche argues that it is the memory of human beings that allows them to "become accustomed to a particular interpretation of causes" (Nietzsche 1964c:Sec. 4). The ability to explain the familiar with unfamiliar enhances a person's power to control things; hence her happiness. Yet while language, which constitutes our memory, is adoptive, nevertheless Nietzsche also is very much aware of its limitation. For he says, "Language and the prejudices upon which language is based very often act as obstacles in our paths when we proceed to explore internal phenomena and impulses..." (Nietzsche 1911 :Sec. 115). Aside explaining the genealogy of truths by way of metaphors, Nietzsche also attempts to explain the origin of concepts and abstractions psychologically. Concepts are products of categorizing similar cases and ignoring their individual differences. From this processes of categorization classes are invented. The commonality attributed to elements of the class refers to the essence of the concept8. But he argues that essence is nothing but the product of relations among the effects of the thing, and can never be the essence of the thing itself. Nietzsche does not only offer psychological explanations for concept formation through metaphors, he also advances other explanations for philosophical concepts like free will, causation, ego, justice, and objectivity. To trace something unfamiliar back to something familiar, is at once a relief, a comfort and a satisfaction, while it also produces a feeling of power. The unfamiliar involves danger, anxiety and care, -the fundamental instinct is to get rid of these painful circumstances. . ..[The] familiar, produces a feeling of such comfort that it is "held true." (Nietzsche 1964c:Sec. 5). 8 A similar psycho-physiological explanation in terms of the development of moral concepts is offered in Beyond Good and Evil, Part V, Sec. 192. LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge SOI</page><page sequence="14">The overcoming of fear is done by seeking "metaphysical comfort". And this intellectual security rests on strong convictions. Conviction is belief in the possession of absolute truth on any matter of knowledge. This belief takes it for granted, therefore, that there are absolute truths; also, that perfect methods have been found for attaining to them; and finally, that everyone who has convictions makes use of these perfect methods.... (Nietzsche 1964a:Sec. 630). Metaphysical comfort is often metamorphosed into a great system. And this system, in turn, excludes other causes and explanations. It becomes the "truth". This is the institutionalization of truth. Anticipating the naturalistic theory of knowledge, he claims: The human brain was gradually filled with such judgments and convictions; and in this tangled skein there arose ferment, strife and lust for power. Not only utility and delight, but every kind of impulse took part in the struggle for "truths": the intellectual struggle became a business, an attraction, a calling, a duty, an honor - cognizing and striving for the true finally arranged themselves as needs among other needs (Nietzsche [1882] 1974:Sec. 110). Free will is posited as the "cause" of the free actions of the ego. But Nietzsche insists that the drive to posit the ego behind the action is something that is grounded on the social psychology of the "priests": The whole of ancient psychology, or the psychology of the will, is the outcome of the fact that its originators, who were the priests at the head of ancient communities, wanted to create for themselves a right to administer punishments -or the right for God to do so (Nietzsche 1964c). Therefore the "priests" or the guardians of tradition monopolized the control of dispensing truth and administering metaphysical comfort through rituals. As for objectivity and disinterestedness, Nietzsche shows that the passion for objectivity is derived from a child's admiration for his parents being fair and just in rendering their judgment. It is nothing but a product of habit and education (Nietzsche 302 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="15">1911 :Sec. 111)9. Later these values were appropriated by the priests, and much later by their successors - scientists and philosophers - to boost their credibility. THE ASCETIC IDEAL, THE WILL TO TRUTH AND THE WILL TO POWER In his Will to Power Nietzsche equates the will to truth with the will to power. The will to truth is the will to mummify "becoming" into "being". Put differently, "it is a process of making things true and lasting, a transvaluation of it into being" (Nietzsche 1964d:Part II, Sec. 552, Par. 5). In the concluding essays of the Genealogy of Morals Nietzsche discusses the spirit of asceticism as expressed in science. For Nietzsche scientific knowledge is a drive towards a world of un-becoming. Insofar as it seeks to discover laws of nature and derive mathematical formulae out of the flux of nature, science shares with the spirit of asceticism. Nietzsche contends that "the ascetic ideal springs from the protective instinct of a degenerating life which tries by all means to sustain itself and o fight for its existence; it indicates a partial physiological obstruction and exhaustion against which the deepest instincts of life, which have remained intact, continually struggle with new expedients and devices" (Nietzsche 1968:111, Sec. 13). It must also be pointed out here that Nietzsche in The Will to Power observes that "[m]an projects his instinct of truth, his "aim," to a certain extent beyond himself, in the form of a metaphysical world of Being, a 'thing-in-itself,' a world ready to hand" (Nietzsche 1964d:Part II, Sec. 552). This projection allows the individual to surrender his will to someone or something higher than him (God, destiny, human nature, etc.). While "logicizing, and systematizing are of assistance as a means of existence," nevertheless, such illusions can "corrupt the innocence of Becoming for ourselves" (Nietzsche 1964d). Corruption of innocence leads to sickness. The ascetic priests are sick in Nietzsche's view. Hence "[t]he sick are man's greatest danger; not evil, not the "beasts of prey." Those 9 Compare this with the psychological profile of an objectivist person in Beyond Good and Evil, Part VI, Sec. 207. LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 10)</page><page sequence="16">who are failures from the start, downtrodden, crushed - it is they, the weakest, who must undermine life among men, who call into question and poison most dangerously our trust in life, in man, and in ourselves" (Nietzsche 1964d). Metaphysicians and religious persons seek "the real world" because they want to eliminate pain and suffering from life. They want to justify life beyond itself. Metaphysics and religion therefore are attempts to escape pains and suffering. Nietzsche exposes the techniques employed by these truth- worshippers: The means employed by the ascetic priest that we have discovered up to now -the general muting of the feeling of life, mechanical activity, the petty pleasure, above all "love of one's neighbor," herd organization, the awakening of the communal feeling of power through which the individual's discontent with himself is drowned in his pleasure in the prosperity of the community - these are, by modern standards, his innocent means in the struggle with displeasure..." (Nietzsche 1968:111, Sec. 19). But the most effective method of controlling the weak is to produce orgy of feeling, that is, the means of "deadening dull, paralyzing, protracted pain." And the chief trick employed by the ascetic priest is exploitation of the sense of guilt. The goal of ascetic ideal is the complete and total renunciation of life in the name truth beyond this world. It is a revenge against life itself. SCIENCE AS THE MODERN EXPRESSION OF ASCETIC QUEST FOR TRUTH Nietzsche believes that it is science that should oppose the ascetic ideal. But he also thinks that "[t]he truth is precisely the opposite of what is asserted here: science today has absolutely no belief in itself, let alone an ideal above it - and where it still inspires passion, love, ardor, and suffering at all, it is not the opposite of the ascetic ideal but rather the latest and the noblest form of it" (Nietzsche 1968:111, Sec. 23). But why is science the "noblest form" of ascetic ideal? 304 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="17">. . .(T)he faith in science. . .affirms another world than that of life, nature, and history; and insofar as he affirms this "other world," does this not mean that he has to deny its antithesis, this world, our world? (Nietzsche 1968:111, Sec. 24) Scientists, by pursuing "pure" truth, behave like metaphysicians and ascetic priests. Hence science and the ascetic ideal are not opposites but together constitute a pair. Therefore they are necessarily allies, so that if they are to be fought they can only be fought and called into question together. A depreciation of the ascetic ideal unavoidably involves a depreciation of science: one must keep one's eyes and ears to this fact! (Nietzsche 1968) Moreover people who are possessed by the "impulse that bids us to seek nothing but certainties in this domain [science] is a religious offshoot." Hence Nietzsche reminds the believers of science, "We have no need of these certainties about the farthestmost horizons in order to live a full and efficient human life, any more than ant needs them in order to be a good ant " (Nietzsche 1964a: Sec. 16). "Truth in itself is no power at all, in spite of all that flattering rationalists are in the habit of saying to the contrary. Truth must either attract power to its side, or else side with power, for otherwise it will perish again and again" (Nietzsche 1 9 1 1 : V, Sec. 535). So, Nietzsche in Joyful Wisdom asks: "This absolute will to truth: what is it? Is it the will not to allow ourselves to be deceived? Is it the will not to be deceived? For the will to truth could also be interpreted in this fashion, provided one included under the generalization, "I will not deceive," the special case, "I will not deceive myself." But why not deceive? Why not allow one self to be deceived? The question for Nietzsche, unlike for Kant, is not what is truth but "what type of individuals will truth." In short, Nietzsche shifts the attention away from epistemology to the question of values. As Gilles Deleuze (1996) points out, Nietzsche's genealogy of truth goes into the heart of values that value truth. As Nietzsche writes in Beyond Good and Evil , "Every great philosophy so far has been: namely, the personal LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 305</page><page sequence="18">confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir; also that the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy constituted the real germ of life from which the whole plant had grown" (Nietzsche 1966:Part I, Sec. 6). In this regard, Nietzsche redirects the entire question towards the social psychology of the will to truth. He deliberately makes use of the vocabulary of medicine and physiology to build his case. Granted that the will to truth is dependent on the values of people that espouse such drive, Nietzsche proceeds to expound the typology of different wills in relation to will to truth. In his The Gay Science (Nietzsche [ 1 882] 1 974: V, 344) Nietzsche provides a perspicuous answer to this question. The will to truth is the will not to be deceived. And the will not to be deceived is perceived by people as "less injurious, less fatal, less dangerous." Nietzsche however mockingly asks: "What do you know of the character of existence in all its phases to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of absolute distrust, or absolute trustfulness?" Why truth at all costs? Nietzsche argues that scientific truth is a mere replacement of the divine truth revealed in Christian religion. It is an attempt at apostetheozation of truth itself. Science rests ultimately on metaphysics. But why this clamor towards metaphysical substance of truth? At ultimate foundation of truth? The will not to be deceived is rooted in the individual's quest for the "true world." The "true world" is posited in contradistinction to the "apparent world" in order to escape becoming of life. As in his analysis of asceticism has established, such quest for certainty is a sign of degenerating life. "To divide the world into a "true" and an "apparent" world," Nietzsche polemically argues, "whether after the manner of Christianity or of Kant. . .is only a sign of decadence, - a symptom of degenerating life" (Nietzsche, Friedrich. 1964c:Sec. 6). Reason in this sense becomes the refuge of metaphysicians to escape the world of becoming. For the Nietzsche "[t]he 'true world' has been erected upon a contradiction of the real world; and it is indeed an apparent world, seeing that it is merely a moralo-optical delusion" (Nietzsche 1964c:Sec. 6). The quest for metaphysical truth for Nietzsche is not just an expression of a degenerating life, but also, it is an expression of the need to "live a full and efficient life" (Nietzsche 1964a:Sec. 16). The 306 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="19">quest for certainty is the quest for security or what Rorty (1999) calls as "metaphysical comfort". POST-NIETZSCHE AN SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE: SOCIOLOGISTS AS CULTURAL PHYSICIANS After discussing Nietzsche's genealogy of knowledge and truth, one might readily agree with the common observation among the uninitiated critics of Nietzsche that he only provided destructive criticisms and failed to offer any positive reconstructive solutions to the problems of his age (Solomon 1999:188). Such judgment finds support in the following passage from Ecce Homo (Preface): "The last thing I should promise would be to "improve" mankind. No new idols are erected by me; let the old ones learn what feet of clay mean."10. In fact, Nietzsche does not even claim to refute arguments, especially against Christianity: "I do not refute ideals, I merely put on gloves before them" (Nietzsche [188811967 ). Yet a closer reading of his writings will reveal a transvalued way of defining knowledge, or what may be called as a "post-Nietzschean" sociology of knowledge. By "post-Nietzschean" it is meant the critical appropriation of Nietzsche's genealogy of Western conception of knowledge. It also refers to the sociological ways of putting into use the legacies bequeathed by Nietzsche out of the ruins of metaphysics. The following discussion will therefore extract some of these valuable legacies for a transvalued sociological understanding of knowledge and truth. First, post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge is has a built-in ideological critique based on clinical standpoint. In Genealogy of Morals (Nietzsche 1968:111, Sec. 14), Nietzsche advocates a medical view of knowledge: That the sick should not make the healthy sick - should surely be our supreme concern on earth; but this requires above all that the healthy should be segregated from the sick, guarded even from the sight of the sick, that they may not confound themselves with the sick. Or is it their tasks, perhaps, to be nurses or physicians (Nietzsche 1968). 1 0 This passage however must be interpreted in the light of "Improvers of Mankind" found in the Twilight of the Idols. LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge J07</page><page sequence="20">For Daniel Ahern (1995), Nietzsche developed a "clinical standpoint" by using physiological analysis in diagnosing the health or sickness of culture. A post-Nietzschean sociological understanding of knowledge foregrounds his analysis of cultural health in terms of analysis of the body. As Ahern puts it, "[j]ust as, for Plato, the individual is the microcosm for his Republic , so, for Nietzsche, is the physiology of the individual represented in the larger organism of culture" (Ahern 1995:29). This means, for sociology of knowledge, that the starting point for analyzing system of beliefs and cultural phenomena must take the health of the bodies of the individuals as starting point. In this context, post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge will become an active diagnosis of cultural sickness. It will provide diagnosis as well as cure for the metaphysical malaise afflicting contemporary theories of knowledge. Its primary weapon is genealogy. For Nietzsche, in order to overcome the need for certainties, "we must ascertain the origin of that troublesome significance that we have attached to these things [truths] for so long. For this we require the history of ethical and religious sentiments, since it is only under the influence of such sentiments that these most acute problems of knowledge have become so weighty and terrifying" ( Nietzsche 1964a:Sec. 16). This is the task of genealogy. As Schacht (1996) puts it, He makes it clear at the outset [of Ecce Homo ] that while "overthrowing idols" is "part of my craft," it is not the whole of what he means by "philosophy."... His larger concern, beyond his war against all such "idols" and his "revaluation of all values" associated with them, is to recover what has been devalued and misinterpreted, and so to achieve a clearer and deeper comprehension of that upon which humanity's "health, its future, the lofty rights to its future" depends. Post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge, following Kaufman (1969) and Schacht's (1996) apt characterization of Nietzsche's philosophy, is not system-oriented, rather it is problem-oriented. Its task involves "the identification and assessment of prevailing interpretations and evaluations, and the development of more satisfactory alternatives" (Schacht 1996:156). 308 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="21">Moreover this sociology of knowledge has an experimental character; it plays off different perspectives with one another until something new is produced. By playing off as many metaphors and perspectives as possible with one another, Nietzsche hopes to achieve greater objectivity. The final output of his experimental analysis is never to be treated as final. They are not to be treated as indubitable dogmas. Rather they are open to countless reweaving and re-arrangement. Hence post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge corresponds very well with Bauman's notion of sociology as hermeneutics or art of interpretation rather than as a body of expert knowledge that aspires to legislate universal truths. It is non-foundational. Bauman (1992:22) echoes Nietzsche's experimental perspectivism: "Interpretation must make interpreted knowledge sensible to those who are not 'inside': but having no extraterrestrial references to appeal to, it has to resort to the 'inside' itself as its only resource." Furthermore Nietzschean sociology of knowledge does not directly refute philosophical systems and propositions. It rather piles up ad hominem arguments against the system-builders in order to "undermine them sufficiently to lay them to rest, exposed as unworthy of being taken seriously -at least by those possessed of intellectual integrity" (Schacht 1996:158). Such strategy, according to Solomon (1996:181) consists of attacking the "motives and emotions of his antagonists rather than refutation of their ideas." Nietzsche employed ad hominem arguments because he believes that "Philosophy. . .is first of all personal engagement, not arguments and their refutations. . .that they are personally felt, steeped in and constitutive of the character of the person in question" (Solomon 1996:217). True, the ad hominem arguments used by Nietzsche did not refute the arguments of his enemy-philosophers. But they did succeed in discrediting the intentions of philosophers and moralists. That is why post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge does not merely diagnose cultural and individual sickness. But more significantly, it also prescribes the re-evaluation of individual values and the goals of a given culture. It is geared towards the creation of new culture and the reorganization of the new physio-economics of the body. Its standard, ultimately, if there is such thing in Nietzsche, is the enhancement of power. Will to power in this sense may be defined as the ability to LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 109</page><page sequence="22">overcome all forms of resistance - including all the sufferings and joys concomitant with it - without succumbing to resentment. In the words of Deleuze, the orientation of a post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge is the affirmation of difference, rather than the negation of what is "other". Overcoming resistance minus resentment leads to vitality and health. But the final overcoming of nihilism or meaninglessness is the creation of culture that will produce human beings that are loyal and committed to this "world" despite the collapse of metaphysics. In "Schopenhauer as Educator" (Nietzsche 1983: Sec. 6) Nietzsche suggests strongly, "let a man be convinced of the real aim of culture - the production of the true man and nothing else." A clinical sociology of knowledge will investigate the cultural conditions that negate the production of human beings that are excluded from the "herd." Like Freud's psychoanalysis it will pave the way for the creation of autonomous individuals that can radically question customary ways of thinking. Then, it can map out the condition under which people can be nurtured to see things in a different light. In short, Nietzsche's genealogy of knowledge is very useful for the sociological understanding of the homogenization of identities in the age of capitalist consumerism and intensifying McDonaldization in all spheres of social and personal spaces. SOCIOLOGISTS AS TRAGIC ARTISTS In his early writings, especially Philosophy and Truth , Nietzsche outlines what he considers as the task of a philosopher (or sociologist): He masters the uncontrolled knowledge drive, though not by new metaphysics. He establishes no new faith. He considers it tragic that the ground of metaphysicians has been withdrawn, and he will never permit himself to be satisfied with the motley whirling games of the sciences. He cultivates a new life; he returns to art its rights (Nietzsche 1999:Sec. 37). The tragic philosopher or sociologist combines arts with sciences. As Nietzsche puts it, "The philosopher should recognize what is needed, and the artist should create it. The philosopher should empathize to the utmost with the universal suffering, just as each of the ancient Greek philosophers expresses a need and erects his system in the vacant space indicated by 110 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="23">that need. Within this space he constructs his world" (Nietzsche 1 999:Sec. 27). In this regard the critical sociology of knowledge must analyze the values and valuing behind systems of belief. Then sociologists, like artists, should create these systems of values. The task of sociologists of knowledge is twofold: to analyze the problems related to the production of knowledge system and to create a new table of values that will underscore new, healthier forms of knowledge system. It culminates in the "perspective of life" (Schacht, 1996:163). Such sociological understanding of knowledge destroys the paralysis of life resulting from knowledge that is monopolized by the new caste of priests: scientific experts, medical advisers, think-tanks, and financial analysts. Post-Nietzschean sociological analysis of truth must serve mundane life. "Must life dominate knowledge, or knowledge life? Which of the two is the higher, and decisive power?" asks Nietzsche in The Use and Abuse of History. "There is no room for doubt," Nietzsche points out, "life is higher, and the dominating power, for the knowledge that annihilated life would itself be annihilated too" (Nietzsche 1983:Sec. 10). He therefore deplores the separation between culture and life. By "separation" Nietzsche means that "[t]his [knowledge of culture] is forced into the young mind in the form of historical knowledge; which means that his head is filled with enormous mass of ideas, taken second- hand from past times and peoples, not from immediate contact with life" (Nietzsche 1983: Sec. 10). Creating a new culture means unlearning our "first nature". At best, it comes to a conflict between our innate, inherited nature and our knowledge, between a stern, new discipline and an ancient tradition; and we plant a new way of life, a new instinct, a second nature, that withers the first (Nietzsche 1983). Post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge will investigate the historical/genealogical creation of truths and knowledge systems that have shaped the way we are. It must do so from a clinical standpoint devoid of any metaphysical foundation. It must diagnose how these truths and system of knowledge have been used either to retard or LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 111</page><page sequence="24">advance the creation of new, higher, and healthier forms of life. To accomplish this, it must deeply analyze the values that underpin these systems of beliefs. Post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge, like Freudian psychoanalysis and Marxism, is both descriptive and critically prescriptive. Its task is not only to describe the state of health or sickness of the body or/and the cultural body, but also, to suggest cure for such ills. In Nietzsche's time, the main problem of the tragic artists is nihilism or the withdrawal of all ultimate meanings that anchor life from the center into the abyss (Vattimo 1996). To be faithful to Nietzsche's spirit, one must now look at the values, valuing systems that are hostile to life. Nietzsche found it in Christianity and science. His cure is art and aesthetics. We, the heirs of post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge, should now look elsewhere - to the new idols and system worshippers - the metaphysicians, Orientalists, and born again positivists. His cure however is still worth reconsidering. TOWARDS A NOMADIC SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE It has been pointed out countless times how the philosophy of Nietzsche is a product of his wondering, isolation, and personal struggle with his own health (Hollingdale 1965). This is clearly manifested in his discussion "The Free Spirit" in Beyond Good and Evil. In this essay Nietzsche advances what he considers as the traits of an independent "philosopher [or sociologist] of the future." Not to remain stuck to our own virtues and become as a whole the victim of some details in us.... One must know to conserve oneself: the hardest test of independence (Nietzsche 1966). This exemplifies objectivity in Nietzschean sociology of knowledge. Such detachment leads Nietzsche to pillory the condition of philosophers ensconced in philosophy departments in German universities ("Schopenhauer as Educator"). Hence he declares, "To live alone one must be an animal or a god -says Aristotle. There is yet a third case: one must be both - a philosopher" ( Twilight of the Idols). Detachment leads to freer thought, but it is also a danger that might lead to the ascetic ideal. 112 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="25">The only way to counteract this is to follow the experimental method and perspectivism: Opinions evolve out of passions; indolence of intellect allows those to congeal into convictions. He, however, who is conscious of himself as a free, restless spirit can prevent this congealing by constant change; and if he is altogether a thinking snowball, he will not have opinions in his head at all, but only certainties and properly estimated probabilities (Nietzsche 1964a). This sums up the notion of reflexivity. This kind of reflexivity is a very radical one because it even questions the value of detachment itself. It means bracketing the "right feelings" and traditions that one is brought up into. By reflexivity I refer to Rosalind Gill's (1995) definition: "based on the notion that the researcher's values should be acknowledged, revealed and labeled and that the researcher is accountable for her interpretations" (cf. Reinharz 1983:172; Henwood and Pidgeon 1995). Reflexivity is a cushion against the fangs relativism arising from thoroughgoing perspectivism. Reflexivity forces sociologists of knowledge not to exempt their own perspectives from the very ideological suspicion they cast on other perspectives (see Plummer 2000). Having rejected absolute truths, and armed with "properly estimated probabilities", where does Nietzsche's authority lie? For David Owen (1994) this is the source of Nietzsche's authority: "If Nietzsche is to speak to us with authority, it is only because his questions and concerns remain our questions and concerns. Nietzsche's authority. . .is not grounded in any claim to complete history of reason nor is it appealing to pre-constituted community, but rather it is grounded in a seduction, that is, in the community of judgment which his work brings into being" (Owen 1994; 83). Hence, sociologists must constantly confront other perspectives grounded in the standpoints of different clashing groups. Such approach does not only widen their theoretical horizons, but also more importantly, exposes the social processes that install hegemonic system of prevailing ideologies11. Paralleling Marx's critique of ideology, post- Nietzschean sociology of knowledge aims at de-mystifying historical truths masquerading as universal principles. Vigorously rejecting the 1 1 For a Marxist version of relativism, see Resnick and Wolff ( 1 987). LANUZA • Musings on Post-Nietzschean Sociology of Knowledge 31)</page><page sequence="26">"privileged position" accorded to universal truth, Nietzschean sociology of knowledge modestly accepts the social situatedness of all claims to truth -thereby anticipating standpoint feminism. Viewed in this way Nietzschean sociology of knowledge can be allied with committed and militant relativism advocated by some feminist and radical writers. As Bauman ( 1 992) rightly suggests, "For the 'interpretive' strategy [post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge] relativity is not just a transitory state, but an apodictically given existential condition of knowledge. Something not to be frowned upon and objected to, but to be drawn conclusions from and adjusted to" (Bauman 1992:22). That is, Nietzsche's perspectivism does not mean, "anything goes" but "nothing goes" (Rogers and Rogers 1996). Every theory, every assumption must be subjected to ruthless critical interrogation including one's own views. All ideas that circulate in the public sphere are contestable and deconstructable. Consequently, the values that underlie these perspectives are themselves critically interrogated. Lastly, the nomadic character of Nietzschean sociology of knowledge entails that sociologists must be willing to incorporate alien perspectives without being absorbed by other perspectives. It is neither a view from nowhere (absolutism) nor a view from everywhere (relativism). Rather it travels and wanders - it is mobile (Lash 2001). As John Richardson (1996) puts it, "Nietzsche pursues a constructive project of understanding, by contrast not just with the polymath's additive one but also with a merely critical, diagnostic, or deconstructive project, which aims just to lay low each pretension to a privileged truth" (Richardson 1996:268). Rather, "Nietzsche thinks some perspectives do 'know better', and not merely by encompassing others (and so 'knowing more'). He thinks we uncover such priorities by engaging these viewpoints in that dialectic of cross-diagnoses and genealogies. That's how we find which side has the stronger case, which side is better able to explain the other" (Richardson 1996:279). Thus post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge must be rooted in a perspective that takes position and interrogates. It involves clash and cross- interrogations of perspectives. And while Nietzsche pins down his hope in the "overmen" of the future, I would argue for the sublation of Nietzsche's aristocratic individualism with the politics of the subaltern. As shown recently by Meitzer and Musolf (2002) ressentiment of the subaltern groups 314 Philippine Sociological Review (2013) • Vol. 61 • No. 2</page><page sequence="27">need not necessarily express "reluctant resignation and passivity," nor "a form of resignation and, as such opposed to active endeavors to avenge or regress the wrongs inducing it"(Meltzer and Musolf 2002:250). "Rather it is a potential source of individual and, especially, collective action and social change" (Meitzer and Musolf 2002:251). Without necessarily developing a Nietzschean politics of the subaltern, it can be argued that knowledge claims arising from such perspective must be historicized. It cannot be a privileged perspective or founded on "first principles"12. Such position would strengthen the post-colonial critique of western metaphysics and the recovery of non- Western ways of knowing. For Philippine sociology, this would entail the opening of the path to critique Western ways of knowing. Nietzsche's clinical standpoint, genealogy, and experimental perspectivism can serve not only as a springboard for developing an effective auto-critique of Western worldview that has shaped Philippine sociology, but more importantly, as an instrument that can guide its practitioners to avoid the pitfalls of metaphysical thinking. This means among other things that post-Nietzschean sociology of knowledge can no longer rely on self-evident truths. Its validity is anchored on the resources of rhetoric. Its rhetorical styles will be written in "blurred genres" (Geertz 1 987) derived from cross-disciplinal dialogue. But such rhetorical style must be calibrated according to the shifting geographic and spatial locations of subaltern perspectives, revolving around the axes of gender, race, class, and ethnicity. By only doing so, will the Nietzschean critique of truth be, not only meaningful, but also more importantly, useful to post-modern sociology of knowledge. 12 For attempts to reconcile Nietzsche's politics with Marxism, see Ryan (1989), Love (1993), Owen (1995), and Connolly (1992).
