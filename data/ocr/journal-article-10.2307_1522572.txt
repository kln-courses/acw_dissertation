A detailed discussion of the two vast subjects of this chapter cannot, of course, be offered here; instead of attempting this, the writer has tried to achieve compression to a degree which may lead to the charge of over-simplification. But the purpose of the first three chapters is merely to indicate the nature of the psychogenetic background which is our heritage, the heritage of China, and of humanity everywhere. This background has been defined by Dr. Jung: "Our modern psychology has discovered that the personal unconscious is only a super- ficial layer, which rests on an entirely different foundation, which we call the collective unconscious. The reason for this designation is the circumstance that, unlike the personal unconscious and its purely personal contents, the images in the deeper unconscious have a distinctly mythological character. That is to say, that in form and content they are in accord with all those widespread primordial representations which underlie every myth and legend. They have no longer a personal nature, but consist of a purely impersonal or super- personal nature, and therefore they are common to all men" (Jung, On the Psychology, p.178). Concepts, therefore, which are common to all men are ancient concepts. Judging by their universality, the ideas of the divinity of animals and of the continued life of the soul after death may be said to be the two most ancient concepts of mankind. They arose from the collective unconscious in a time so remote that this collective unconscious, as yet uncovered by layers of acquired and transmitted experience, comprised the entire consciousness of man. Therefore primitive people reacted to their environment in identical ways in all parts of the world. The similarities of reaction are the more striking because modern discoveries in anthropology indicate the probability that homo sapiens developed independently in more than one region. "Considering all this evidence, it seems that there must have been, not 1</page><page sequence="10">TWO one, but several centers, where man has developed". (Weidenreich, Apes, Giants and Allan, p. 83). As Dr. Jung says, a characteristic of the collective unconscious is its impersonality. Primeval man had no ego; he was conscious of the surrounding animal-world, but had no consciousness of himself as an individual. Like all the animals, he was limited by the periphery of his immediate consciousness, within which he was excessively alert and aware. Having no conception of individuality, he was merely one of the vast brotherhood of all living creatures. There was to him no difference in nature between him and the animals, with whom indeed he felt a sense of kinship so strong that it often merged into identity. But though the natures were the same, there was a difference in powers; the animals' powers often exceeded his; furthermore, they were of unknown extent, and the Unknown is always a potential enemy. Consequently early man has a dual attitude toward the animals: a sense of kinship amounting to identity; and a sense of apartness due to fear of their unknown supernatural powers which invest the animals with divinity. Belief in the soul and its continuance after death is very ancient; evidences are found in the graves of late Acheulean times (MacCulloch, State of the Dead). The soul was the life-force, and when the body perished it continued to live in some other form. It was as- sociated with breath, and by extension with the wind; with fire, since the living are warm; with blood; with shadows, and reflections in the water. The soul is indestructible; its reality is perpetual, but its manifestations are various. It departs from the dead only to be rein- carnated in another form. Alexander points out that the primitive idea of the relation between matter and spirit resembles the relation between form and energy. This unseen force is a greater reality to primitive man than the beings or objects which he actually perceives. The names of these beings or objects belong to this greater reality; a name therefore signifies the soul; indeed it actually is the soul. The same is true of the image (Alexander, Soul). The presence of a divine animal near a grave, or its association with the dead person in any way, caused the belief that this soul had entered that particular creature. The spiritual powers of the soul were considered to be greater after death than during life; the extent and nature of those powers being unknown, the soul also was a potential enemy. Tapus, in the writer's opinion, are derived from this idea of the potential enemy; they are designed to protect man from things which are "psychically dangerous" (Linton and Wingert, Arts, p. 12). The souls most favorably inclined to a man were naturally those of his ancestors, therefore he reverenced whichever of the divine animals they had entered after death. Belief in the soul is far older than belief in a Supreme God (Petrie, Egyptian Religion). The idea of a Supreme Deity probably arose from the concept of the guardian-ancestral spirit-man's first attempt to find a protective explanation of life and death which shall insure safety for</page><page sequence="11">THREE his perishable self and his imperishable but vulnerable soul. From the beginning the con- cepts of the soul and of the divinity of animals are indissolubly united. This union con- stitutes the oldest religion. As some writers deny the name of religion to animal-worship. it becomes necessary to define the term "religion" as it will be used in this book. Existing definitions are various and irreconcilable; for instance, "A sum of scruples which impede the free exercise of our faculties" (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 3); Religion is "the belief in spiritual beings" (Cook, quoting Tylor, Religion). Other definitions are both too modern and too limited. The terms "magic" and "animism" are continually applied to primitive religions, and disagreement as to the definition of magic is almost as great as that concerning the definition of religion. Marett quotes several writers: Frazer believed that magic preceded religion and that it was "a false science and an abortive art"; Van Gennep considered that religion and magic were an indivisible whole; Hubert and Mauss held that they represented opposite poles, religion being social, magic illicit and anti-social (Marett, Magic). Reinach calls magic "a factor" of religion (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 13). Marett points out that the term "magic" has had derogatory connotations since its be- ginning. Originally applied by the Greeks to the religious and occult practices of the Persian Magi, those powerful priests who were probably descendants of the aboriginal Medes, the term has always been, he says, "suspect" and can hardly be used without implying "something inferior". He continues, "It remains only to ask whether 'magic' is a suitable word for the designation of the most rudimentary type of cult. On the whole, it would seem a pity for the evolutionist to apply a term redolent of disparagement to what in his view is a genuine phase of the serious life as lived under certain conditions of culture. It is far less question-begging to predicate religion throughout" (Marett, Magic). With Marett's point of view the writer is in complete agreement. The term is not only late in origin, but it is the word used by organised religions to describe practices involving super- natural forces which are held outside the auspices of the aforesaid religion. It is incorrect and misleading to apply the term to primitive beliefs, which were the religions of their period. The term "animism", since it gives no idea of life-force beyond being, nor of the plurality of the soul and its capacity to appear in different manifestations, seems too limited to be applied as a sole definition to the religion of primitive man. Since it is the writer's opinion that animal-worship should be regarded as the earliest religion, it remains now to find a definition of religion which shall apply to animal-worship and to all other types of religion. Dr. Jung has given the profound definition, "Religion, it might be said, is the term that designates the attitude peculiar to a consciousness which has been altered by the experience of the numinosum" (Jung, Psychology and Religion, p. 6). This is the basic psychological definition; since this study is concerned with the outward</page><page sequence="12">FOUR expressions of this noumenal experience -an experience which seems to have been general with early man -the definition of the term as used in this book must be more externalised and concrete. The term "religion" will signify: Belief in and worship of the divinity and powers of a Deity or Deities, and the adoption of certain procedures consequent upon this belief. Within his original narrow periphery, early man found his first gods. With every extension of the periphery, religion alters, the gods change, and recede. Certain primitive rituals may have had a secular origin, beginning in a period before religious concepts were formed, and attaining later a religious character. This may be true of the rites of the so-called "hunting magic" in particular; the writer offers the following tentative theory as to the origin of the hunting-rites: In the stage when man had ceased to eat carrion and begun to hunt, he was probably still largely inarticulate and used gestures and actions as well as, or in place of, words. His life depended upon hunting; it was also endangered by hunting, which was therefore the most serious of undertakings. One of the many things which early man learned from association with the great animals was the value of co-operation; one man alone could not cope with a mammoth or a bison, but a group could. If then a man saw some food-animal, too large for him to hunt alone, his procedure probably would be to return to his group, or to summon them with a "hunting howl", or a "hunting grunt", or perhaps an imitation of the sound made by the animal. When they assembled, he would first-indicate the direction in which he had seen the creature, which would give them an idea of the terrain to be tra- versed; he would then describe the nameless animal by imitating its most salient general characteristics, then by imitating the acts of this particular individual, whether it was brows- ing, drinking, sleeping, etc. If there were more than one animal, he would probably repeat the imitation, and then pantomime a hunt. This procedure of gesture and pantomime might continue from necessity for a time; later, when man was more articulate it would be continued because it was associated with successful hunts-and the majority must have been successful, or man would not have survived. With the development of religious feel- ing the procedure becomes a ritual before the hunt; it is really the dramatic enactment of a prayer in whose efficacy there is complete faith as it has preceded success so often before. The rite is not only the image of the hunt, it is the hunt; it is mystically identical with it. If primitive man believed that the ritual brought success in hunting, the belief is the effect of such rituals and not the cause. Hunting is a religious undertaking among many tribes today; the hunt is preceded by various rites, and by fasting and continence on the part of the hunters. The number of animals which have been worshipped as divinities, or as soul-animals, is formidable. Omitting the birds, which will be discussed in Chapter III, the most important are:</page><page sequence="13">FIVE The alligator, ant-eater, ape, armadillo, ass, baboon, bat, bear, beaver, bison, boar, buffalo, bull, came], cat, catfish, cheetah, cow, coyote, crab, crocodile, cuttlefish, deer, dog, dogfish, dolphin, eel, elephant, elk, ewe, fish, flying-fox, fowl, fox, frog, gazelle, giraffe, goat, gorilla, guanaco, halibut, hare, hedgehog, hippopotamus, horse, hyaena, ichneumon, jackal, jaguar, kangaroo, leopard, lion, lioness, lizard, llama, lobster, lynx, marten, mongoose, monkey, mouse, octopus, opossum, otter, peccary, pig, porcupine, prawn, puma, python, rabbit, ram, reindeer, rhinoceros, various rodents, salmon, sardine, seal, sea-lion, sea-otter, sea-tortoise. serval, shark, shrew-mouse, skate, sloth, snake, squirrel, sword-fish, tapir, tiger, toad, tortoise, trout, turtle, wallaby, weasel, whale, wild-cat, wolf. The principal insects are: the ant, bee, beetle, butterfly, caterpillar, centipede, cicada, cricket, dragon-fly, earth-worm, firefly, fly, grasshopper, locust, mantis, moth, scorpion, spider, wasp, weevil, wood-worm. In Tahiti formerly all insects were agents of the gods or of spirits (Henry, Ancient Tahiti, p. 391). A few of these deities will be considered briefly: the reptiles, the felines, cattle, and the bears, as these are all important groups; and three insects: the scorpion, the caterpillar, and the cricket. The evidence suggests that the earliest deities were the reptiles, the snake being probably the first God, as snake-worship is universal. It is found in China, Japan, Indo-China, Borneo, Sumatra, Indonesia, India, Australia, Egypt; among many African tribes: Bantu, Awemba, Zulus, Matabele, Mashun, Masai, Barotse, Mawamba, pygmies of the Congo, Waramara, Hottentots; in Dahomey and Abyssinia; among the Canaanites, Hebrews, Phoenicians, Cretans, Greeks, Romans, Lombards, Celts, Germans, Russians, Lithuanians, Scandinavians. The rattlesnake is honored everywhere in the Western Hemisphere; Indians are descended from a snake; the Hopis, Apaches, Algonquins, in whose writing the snake equals the symbol of life, Dakotas, Zufnis, and other tribes all consider it sacred. The great serpent-mound, one thousand feet long, in Ohio indicates the importance of the snake in the past. In Central America serpent-worship existed in Yucatan, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico; among the Carib tribes; and it still exists in Haiti. Columbia, Dutch Guiana and Brazil had serpent-worship. The feathered snake-god is a creation of the Western Hemisphere; a horned snake-deity is found in the temples of the god Pachacamac in Peru; and also among the Kwakiutl Indians of the Northwest. The snake was perhaps originally a chthonic deity, and a soul-animal, the earliest home of the soul having been underground. So much has been written about serpent-worship that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject here. The alligator and the crocodile were also very ancient gods. According to Barton, snake- and crocodile-gods preceded the hawk- and cattle-divinities in many parts of Egypt. In the oldest list of the nomes, the name of the 6th nome in Upper Egypt is the representation of a crocodile with a feather on its head; in the loth nome, Upper Egypt, the oldest deity</page><page sequence="14">SIX was the uraeus snake; in the .2st it was the crocodile-god. The capital of the l2th nome was named "The Mountain of the Horned Viper", and another of its cities contained many mummified crocodiles. In Lower Egypt the crocodile-god reigned in the 4th and qth nomes; the uraeus snake in the 6th, 7th, 8th, i8th, i9th and 20th nomes. (Barton, Semitic and Hamitic Origins, Ch. VI). The cobra always adorned the crown of Lower Egypt, and crocodile-worship continued throughout Egyptian history. In the Greek period crocodiles were gods in the ist nome of Upper Egypt; and Van Gennep, quoting from Toutain's Le culte du crocodile dans le Fayum sous ]'Empire Romain, says that in the Roman period the reptile was not the representative of a god, but the god himself. One of his epithets was "le dieu au beau visage." Van Gennep also relates that Breccia discovered a fresco depicting the procession of a mummified crocodile-god wrapped in white and wear- ing a high crown. (Van Gennep, L'Etat actuel, etc., p. i86). The son of Cleopatra called the crocodile "grandfather" (Thomas, Animals). Nyakang, the divine ancestor of the Shilluks of the White Nile, was born of a mother with crocodile-attributes, which he inherited, though he could also appear in the forms of a white bird, a giraffe, a grasshopper, or a snake, etc. His spirit was immanent in every king of the tribe (Seligman, Shilluks); which is similar to the belief of the immanence of Horus in every Egyptian Pharaoh. Worship of the croco- dile still exists in Baroda, India (Crooke, Dravidians); in Borneo, where the crocodile is the ancestor of the Klemantans, who address him as "grandfather" (Smith, Animal-standards); in Java and Sumatra it is a soul-animal; in Banka and the Moluccas it is a god (Kruijt, Indo- nesians). In Celebes crocodiles are the abodes of ancestral spirits; among the Tagalogs of the Philippines anyone who is killed by a crocodile becomes a god (Thomas, op. Cit.). In the Western Hemisphere the alligator or crocodile was divine wherever it existed; it was a deity from southern Peru.to northern Costa Rica (Lothrop, Coce', p. 125). It is found on the painted and sculptured pottery, in stone, jade, bone, and metal; it is figured on the discs and helmets of gold. The excessive stylisation of the representations indicates an ancient cult (Lothrop, op. cit., II, Figs. 93, 148, 149), which is further demonstrated by the fact that the crocodile has become composite in many instances; it may be somewhat anthropomor- phised, or it may appear with a frog's head (op. Cit. I, Fig. 152), or with a monkey's head (op. cit., II, Fig. 64). It is most frequently combined with a bird; the most usual form is the crocodile- headed bird (op. cit, II, Figs. 7, 52, 82, 83, 84, 85). In a case where the reptile is represented at all naturalistically, it is double-headed, the second head being where the tail should be. This image is on a gold helmet from Darien (op. cit., I, Fig. iio). The unostentatious frog, as a deity or as a soul-animal, is almost ubiquitous. It appears, though rarely, on the earliest painted pottery found at Abu Shahrain (Hall, Season's Work etc., n. p. 199); in pre-dynastic Egypt it was a symbol of creation and resurrection; the frog- goddess was Heqet (Gardiner, Life and Death. The Tati Bushmen of Africa hold a frogdance</page><page sequence="15">SEVEN (Basset, Tati Bushmen). The toad appears in proto-Elamite pictographs, and is frequently found at Persepolis (Herzfeld, Iran, p. 65). A late Vedic hymn praises frogs as the givers of cows and long life (MacDonell, Vedic Religion); in Nepal the frog was worshipped (Crooke, Nepal). In Ceylon it is thought to be the ultimate support of the world, which rests on a giant serpent lying on a turtle which is held up by the frog, beyond which is only air. It is to be noted that all the supporting animals are reptiles. The Mongols also believe that the earth is supported by a frog. (Thomas, op. cit.). In Indo-China it is an ancestral soul, which is also guardian of the rice-fields, and associated with rain. The Sea-Dyaks of Borneo believe that the goddess Salampandai in the form of a frog brings newborn children. The Malays consider that the tiger and the fish were both metamorphosed from frogs (Skeat, Malay Magic, p. 308). In the earliest book of Japan, the Kojiki, an incident is related in which the toad possesses more knowledge than the gods (Kojiki, p. 103). In Europe a frog or toad brings new-born children to the Wends; in Germany the toad is a household deity. The Roumanians believe that anyone who kills a frog will murder his mother (Thomas, op. cit.). These three instances indicate an ancient European belief in the frog as an ancestor. In the Western Hemisphere also the frog is important. In Venezuela stone frog figurines are found in graves in the states of Lara, Merida, and Trujillo (Osgood and Howard, Archaeological Survey, pp. 79, 91, 125); a frog on pottery occurs at Ronquin (Howard, Excavations at Ronquin, p. 72); at Tocoron the animals most frequently represented are the frog and the monkey. Osgood says that while these two creatures appear very frequently in South and Central America, at Tocor6n they evidently had a particular religious signifi- cance (Osgood, Excavations at Tocoron, pp. 51-2). In Colombia, gold or copper-gold figurines of frogs range from southern Colombia to southern Mexico, and are most frequent in Chiriqui (Lothrop, Coclh, I, p. 185; Figs. 44a, 45C, 48, a, c, d; Bennett, Archaeological Remains, PI. 8, j). Frogs also appear on gold discs (Lothrop, op. cit., I, Fig. 88) and as nose- ornaments (op. cit., I, ii8 e). With the Chibchas in northern Colombia the frog was a divinity associated with a ceremony involving the calendar. The Caribs also had images of a frog-deity (Thomas, op. cit.). A monolith of a frog with a bird's tail was found at Tihuanacu, Bolivia, and a frog also appears on the "Thunderbolt" stela there (Posnansky, Tihuanacu, II, Figs. 152, I5za). A pottery frog is found in Mochik, Peru (Del Pomar, Arte del Peru, PI. 19). In Yucatan the frog was apparently a moon-symbol (Beyer, Variants of Glyph D); beautiful gold frog-images still exist. Among the Toltecs of Mexico the frog was a goddess, with a temple of her own (Vailliant, Aztecs, p. 52). The Zunii Indians believe that children were metamorphosed into frogs, which then became gods (Kroeber, Zuini). The Haida of the Northwest use the frog in a ceremonial head-dress (Davis, Native Arts, No. 67); the Tlingit of Alaska also use the frog in a carved wooden head-dress (Davis, op. cit., No. 108), and frogs appear frequently on the so-called totem-poles.</page><page sequence="16">EIGHT In all these instances the frog-deity is auspicious, but there are exceptions. Van Gennep writes of a North African tribe, the Hababra, who have a sacred repulsion to the frog, and are forbidden even to look at one; this is also true of the Ouled Sebil. In Algiers the evil spirits, the djinni, may be incarnated as frogs (Van Gennep, op. cit., p. 227). This attitude of North African tribes suggests a possible Semitic influence: "And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet" (Revelation XVI, I3). Among the most important of all the animal-gods were the great felines. The tiger was worshipped in Korea, Eastern Siberia, Manchuria, China, Indo-China, Borneo, Sumatra, Malaya, India; the leopard in Java, the East Indies and Africa; the lion in the Near East, Egypt, and Africa; the puma in the mountains and the jaguar in the lower country in the Western Hemisphere. The tiger and the jaguar are the most important deities *of their relative hemispheres. The tiger was the principal animal-god of early China; it was a god in Korea until the introduction of Christianity, and there are still temples to the mountain-god, whose image is that of an old man riding on a tiger. The tiger was a deity to the Tungus tribes; Manchuria had a tiger-god. In Hanoi, Tongking, there is a temple to the tiger-god, where his image is worshipped (Thomas, op. cit.). In Cochin-China it is also a divinity (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 217). Japan, having no tigers, had no tiger-god, but the largest carnivores, the wolves, were worshipped. A man addressed them as "august deities"; he rinsed his mouth, bathed his hands "and made prayer to them" (Nihongi, II, p. 36). In Borneo, Sumatra, and in Malaya generally the tiger is a deity. In the Malay peninsula tigers are believed to own towns in which they dwell like human beings. There are many spirit- or ghost-tigers, who can be discerned by their footprints, as a ghost-tiger always has one foot which is smaller than the other three (Skeat, Malay Magic, p. 163). The tiger is the land-manifestation of Siva, as the crocodile is his water-manifestation (op. cit., P. 89). In India the tiger is a god in many localities, and is generally reverenced as a protector of agriculture, which was also the case in early China. The jaguar is a god over a great part of South America and Central America. On the Chavin stone carvings, which represent, Tello says, the earliest Peruvian culture, as they are found in a stratum lower than that of any other culture (Tello, Discovery), and which he places at iooo B. C., all the animal-heads in the round are those of felines, and on the flat carvings the feline predominates. It is sometimes combined with the wings and beak of the condor, or with the serpent (Bennett, Chavin, PIs. 2,3). The puma is one of the principal motifs in the symbolic carvings on the sun-gate at Tihuanacu (Posnansky op. cit.). It also ap- pears on a monolith at Wancani, Bolivia, in association with a tailed figure wearing a feather crown and feline-headed serpents (Ryden, Archaeo/ogica/ Research, Monolith 1, p.go seq.).</page><page sequence="17">NINE In Brazil, the Moxo priests, who worship the jaguar, must be attacked and wounded by one before they can become priests (Landtmann, Priest). In the Argentine the jaguar is a sky-god, also the "weeping god". In Ecuador he is a sun-god (Spinden, Lectures). The agricultural connection with the jaguar is marked in Central America. The image of the Corn-God found in Copan, Honduras, wears on his breast a jaguar's head with three snakes depending from it (Keleman, Med. Am. Art, P1. 89 a). The Codex Dresdensis states that Ah Balam is a male jaguar, the god of woods; Ah Baluc Balam is the male of eleven jaguars, the god of harvests (Raynaud, Les Manuscrits). In "The Tiger and Agriculture", the writer has referred to the four jaguar-gods which guard the corners of the cornfield in modern Quintana Roo, the eastern part of Yucatan. The jaguar-deity is found everywhere in ancient Yucatan. At Tikal, which is one of the two oldest cities, a stela was discovered on which there is what is perhaps the first representation of a human figure in full front view who wears a jaguar- head in his head-dress (Morley, Ancient Maya, PI. 63, p. 368). A vase from Uaxactun, the other of the two oldest cities, shows a jaguar, seated like a human being, holding a bowl covered by an inverted bowl, and facing a priest wearing a jaguar head- dress (op. cit., P1. 87). A priest wearing an entire jaguar-skin, with the head hanging downward, is on a vase from Alta Vera Paz, Guatemala (op. cit., P1. 88); this image also occurs at other places. There are jaguar-priests on the frescoes recently discovered by Mr. Giles at Bonampak, and many other examples exist. There are also jade images re- presenting a jaguar holding a human head in its mouth (op. cit., P1. 91) reminiscent of the same type in Asia, and also having, in the writer's opinion, a protective significance. The writer considers that the great masks on the stairs of the pyramid at Uaxactun are jaguar- heads (Op. cit., P1. 58). In Mexico the Olmecs confessed their sins to jaguars and to the earth-goddess Tzazolteotl (Covarrubias, quoting Kirchoff, Mexico South, p. 114). The jaguar was connected with the earth and caves. The agricultural connection is again suggested at a festival-dance which was performed in Tehuantepec at least until 1927, at which a man danced with a stuffed jaguar crowned with flowers, to the music of the "jaguar tune" (op. cit., pp. 153, n. i, and 321). The cat, always an uncanny animal, may be chosen to be the supernatural guardian of a village, as in Tongking (James, Tutelary Gods); or it may be a dangerous spirit, as on Easter Island (Metraux, Ethnology of Eastern Island, p. 320). It was a divinity apparently only in Egypt, where in certain localities it was worshipped and mummified after death. In Germany and France it was one of the many animals which represented the spirit of the grain, at the gathering of the harvest. Frazer lists Kiel, Eisenach, Uberland, Silesia, the Vosges Mountains, Lyons, Vesoul, Besanson, Amiens, and Franche Comte as places where the cat is the grain spirit. It is sometimes killed at the end of the harvest, and in certain places in France it is roasted and eaten on the following Sunday (Frazer, Spirits, I, p. 281).</page><page sequence="18">TEN These facts may explain the following item which appeared in the New York Herald- Tribune of December 7th, 1946: "FESTIVE VOYAGE The Gripsholm sailed yesterday for Scandinavian ports with six Christmas trees, 243 rare mink, ten foxes, and 1, 376 passengers. . . . The Christmas trees will be set up on Dec. 13 for the festival of St. Lucia, the virgin and martyr of Syracuse, and girls wearing lighted candles on their heads will serve coffee and some special cakes baked in the form of a cat, a ceremony whose meaning has been lost in antiquity ". Eating a cake in the form of an animal or a person implies that the animal or person was formerly eaten. Apparently ever since the paleolithic era, cattle have been important animal-gods. Images of bisons, bulls and cows occur frequently in the caves of southern France and Spain. One may speculate as to whether there is any connection between these divinities in caves and the worship of bulls in subterranean caverns in Sardinia in the Bronze Age, and the Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete. With the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Hindus, the Hittites, Iranians and Hebrews, the bull was a deity. It is a god to the cattle-raising tribes in Africa; it was divine in Scandinavia, where, according to the Eddas, the cow was created before gods or man; also in Germany, and other places in Europe. The cult of the bear had an enormous range in the Northern Hemisphere; it extended over North America across northern Asia, with traces in India, on into the European peninsula, dipping down into Greece, through Switzerland, and it has left relics in England. Carpenter has discussed this northern element in Greece (Carpenter, Folk Tale, Chapters VI, VII). Luquet has shown conclusively that the bear-cult did not originate in paleolithic Europe; there are very few images of the bear, and no evidences of a cult (Luquet, Le culte d 'Ours). Nor does a cult seem to have existed in neolithic Europe; the representations of bears are rare. One would expect to find them among the rock-carvings of Scandinavia and northern Russia, but in the first instance they are practically non-existent, and at Lake Onega and the White Sea in Russia, the images of the bear are so few as to be negligible. The absence of the cult in these early eras may have been due to prevailing conditions. There was no doubt a great abundance of food for the bear, which consequently did not interfere with man. The facts that the bear hibernated and was a solitary hunter were also separating factors. In Europe the bear seems to have been generally avoided until a fairly late period. According to Czaplicka, the bear ceremonies originated among the Paleo-Siberians, the Koryaks and the Ainus. She places the Tungusic tribes among the Neo-Siberians; one Tungus group, the Lamut, mixed with the Paleo-Siberian Koryaks (Czaplicka, Siberia).</page><page sequence="19">ELEVEN Hallowell also believes that the cult may have originated with some paleolithic tribe as simple hunting rites. He points out that it is in the Amur-Gulf of Tartary region that the rites have developed into elaborate bear-ceremonialism. (Hallowell, Bear-ceremonalism, etc., p. 8i) This is a Tungusic region. Hallowell cites Torii, who believes-'that the Gilyaks originated the bear-festival. If the rites originated in the area where the ceremony has become most elaborate, there seems to be the possibility that it is a late cult, perhaps de- pendent on the invention of metal weapons, the traditional ceremonial weapons being the spear and the knife. Various elements of the Tungus ceremonies are found very far afield. In their rites the ceremonial bear is led to all the houses in the village to bring them good fortune and welfare and is then led to the river to confer fertility on the fish. The animal represents the god of the mountain; it is his messenger; it is prayed to, and after its death the skull is placed on a sacred post and addressed as "Divine Preserver" or "Precious Divinity". A survival of these rites in China is found in the early literature, in a passage in the Chou Li. Here the bear has become anthropomorphised; an official, called the "Inspector of the Region, or Universal Preserver", impersonates the bear; he wears the skin of a young bear ornamented with four yellow metal eyes, and red and black garments, the black represent- ing heaven, the red the earth. With a spear and a shield, and followed by one hundred attendants, he visits the houses, and drives away disease. On the occasion of a great funeral, he precedes the coffin. When it is lowered into the grave he strikes the four corners with his spear, chasing away the Mang-liang (Chou Li, XXXI, 27-8). The Mang-liang is a mountain demon; the bear is, as has been said, associated with mountains. Certain rituals of the Han and later dynasties seem to be derived from the rites of the Bear-impersonator of the Chou Li. In the Han Dynasty the ceremony Ta No, Great Calamity, was performed in the Imperial Palace to dispel pestilences. The most important figure was the Fang-siang-che, which is the title used for the Bear-impersonator in the Chou Li. He wore a bearskin with four yellow eyes, a black upper and a red lower garment, and carried a spear and a shield. He had one hundred and twenty attendants, who sang, after which the Impersonator danced, accompanied by twelve persons disguised as various animals and birds, having "hair, feathers, or horns". After three tours of the room the whole company, holding torches, went out by the south gate to the river in which they left the evil spirits of pestilence (Granet, Danses et le'gendes, I, p. 300- I). The ancient ceremony is essentially the same. The twelve various animals suggest another northern rite, that of summoning the animal spirits of various localities (Chou Li, XXII, i8). The rites continued for centuries. Only small drums were used in the Han ceremony. In the Sui Dynasty drums and trumpets were used; the attendants numbered two hundred and forty; the Fang-siang-che wore a bearskin covering his head. No torches are mentioned; and a new element is the sacrifice of a ram and a cock at the gate by which the exorcists</page><page sequence="20">TWELVE departed. In the ceremonies of the T'ang Dynasty the Fang-siang-che was masked; the attendants numbered twenty, twenty-four, forty or sixty, according to the importance of the place of the performance. A ram and a cock were sacrificed at the central gate of the palace, and at the gates of the four cardinal points (Granet, op. cit., P. 303-4). In North America today the bear-ceremonies of the Ojibwa Indians are astonishingly similar to those of the Tungus; the shaman asks the slain bear to tell the other bears how well he has been treated; the bones and remains are buried; dogs are not allowed to go near the dead bear; the paws and head are decorated. The Ojibwas hold the belief that the life of the bear continues, and here it may be said that the conception of death among primitive races is different from that of later peoples. The Tungus believe that the bear's spirit continues; it may inhabit another bear, or the bear itself may actually be reincarnated. Wallace noted this attitude in the Aru Islands, where, when he was skinning the birds he had shot, a native watching him said: "They will all come to life again." This was also the belief in New Guinea (Wallace, Malay Archipelago, p. 463). Rydh quotes Rivers as saying that the Melanesians have no word corresponding to "death"; the nearest equivalent, "mate", means a state -rather than an event -and burial is an initiation into a new condition (Rydh, Seasonal Fertility Rites, BMFEA, 3). The Rig-Veda voices the same idea in the sacrifice of a bull to Indra and a white goat to Surya, the sun-god: "Thou dost not die; no harm is done thee; thou goest to the gods by pleasant paths" (MacDonell, Vedic Religion). The bear is associated with health; this seems to be the case generally in America; in one tribe, the Tewa of First Mesa, the old word for "doctor" and "bear" are the same. Traces of this attribute of the bear survive in India, where sick or ailing children are made to ride on tame bears as bears frighten away disease (Thomas, op. cit.); or they wear bears' hair around their necks for the same reason (Marshall, Further Excavations, p. 74, n. 5). Among the insect-deities the scorpion seems to have been the most ancient. Like the frog, it appears on the earliest painted pottery at Abu Shahrain (Hall, op. cit., p. i99n); and on cylinder seals of the Jemdet Nasr period (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, PI. VIII). Images of the scorpion are found in pre-dynastic graves in Egypt (Petrie, Egyptian Religion), and a fragment of a pre-dynastic palette shows a scorpion with a lion and hawks destroying seven walled cities. Menes was said to have been preceded by a ruler of Upper Egypt named Scorpion, who was an incarnation of Horus (Frankfort, Kingship, etc., pp. 17-18). When Isis searched for Osiris in the swamps of the Delta she was accompanied by seven scorpions (Frazer, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, II, p. 8). Von Oppenheim says that the scorpion and the scorpion-man existed in the earliest times in southern Mesopotamia and Elam (von Oppenheim, TellfHalaf, p. 194). The Gilgamesh Epic describes the scorpion-men who guard the gates of the sun. A scorpion-man is with the animal-orchestra on a shell inlay found at Ur (Woolley, The Sumerianf, P1. II). With the Hittites the scorpion-men become</page><page sequence="21">THIRTEEN scorpion-bird-men, who guard the palace gates and archway at Tell Halaf. (Von Oppenheim, op. cit., PIs. XLIa, b; XLII a). There was also an early mythical Semitic sovereign, Zugakip the Scorpion (Pinches, Sumero-Akkadians). One of the strangest insect-deities is a grass-green caterpillar four inches long with black spots, which was worshipped in a certain district in Japan in the seventh century. The caterpillar was called "the God of the Everlasting World," and the cult, upheld by the witches and wizards of the district, grew with fanatical rapidity. It was terminated only when the local Governor killed Ohofu Be no Oho, the man who had originated it (Nihongi, II, pp. 188-9, record of 644 A.D.). The cricket is a soul-insect in certain parts of Indonesia. The Sundanese and the Galalarese believe that the soul substance, that mysterious essence which permeates the living person but which is not the soul that appears after death, may leave a sleeping person in the form of a cricket. The Torajas think that the cricket is a departed person who leads the living to the land of souls. In Tahiti formerly the cricket, shadow of the God of stability, Ti, was also a god, with a temple and a priest. The cricket-god protected refugees in time of war. He controlled three winds: "Sky-of-sickness-from-the-Gods"; a wind which had the sound of a cricket and was called "Cry-that-detached-canoes"; and a great wind that drove enemies into the sea and was called "Lost-in-the-haze-of-distant-distracting-sounds-of-the-cricket." (Henry, Ancient Tahiti, p. 391). There were no large animals on Tahiti, but practically every living creature there and in the surrounding sea was sacred. The evidence in general indicates that the available animals of a locality, whatever their types, have been worshipped by the people of that region. When primitive man, having through experience gained a certain amount of control over his surroundings, or, having made an adjustment to them, began to have leisure to consider his environment more in detail, he extended his concept of divinity to include everything in nature. Stones and rocks, judging by the universality of their worship, were probably the first objects after the animals to be regarded as deities. This was not because of any real or imagined resemblance of the stones to any living creature, but because of their own inherent divinity. Stones of unusual shape or color had powerful supernatural qualities. Such stones were gods for the Ostiaks (Czaplicka, Ostiaks); in the Banka Islands and the New Hebrides the sacred places always contained stones; if none were found there, some were brought there (Codrington, Melanesians); in Peru the gods were pebbles of different colors (Spence, Peru); a red stone represented Siva as Bhairava in Central India (Hopkins, Bhairava); a black stone represented Durga (Crooke, Stones). Stones also were the abodes of ancestral spirits; the Kamba tribe of South Africa prayed to the ancestral spirits before a sacred rock (Hartland, Stones); the Gonds of Bengal keep pebbles which represent the</page><page sequence="22">FOURTEEN ancestors in a sacred part of the house (MacCulloch, State of the Dead, etc.). Among the primitive tribes of Indo-China, pebbles of peculiar colors or shapes are sacred, and sacrifices are made to them. Some are kept in the common-house of the village, as protectors; some are kept in bags attached to a pillar of the house (Cabaton, Indo-China), which suggests an ancestral connection. There are indications that the first images were those of the ancestral spirits, not of the gods. In the Banka Islands and the New Hebrides there are images of the dead, but only stones in the sacred places (Codrington, op. cit.). The Lapps and Samoyeds have a wooden god and a stone god; the wooden god, which is the ancestor, is a block which may have a crudely indicated head (MacRitchie, Lapps and Samoyeds). Unhewn stones continued to represent the gods till a late date. Pausanias says that in the temple of Herakies at Hyettus a stone instead of a statue represented Herakies; and that this was also the case in the temple of Eros at Thespiae. The Lithuanians still worshipped a large stone in the eighteenth century (Schrader, Aryan Religion). This probability that the ancestor- image pre-dates the god-image suggests that the paleolithic figurines of Europe and Asia, the so-called "Venuses" and mother-goddesses, may represent the female ancestors. They would then be the "mothers", so to speak, of the mother-goddesses, which, being associated with the earth and fertility, would be later, and which probably originated in the Near East. Other deities besides the rocks and stones were caves, mountains, water, trees, plants. But the animal-gods were not superseded; the spirits of these deities of the earth had the forms of animals: the mountain-spirit is a bear; the river-spirit is a bull, for instance. Later on, when man's mental periphery had extended to include the heavens and the natural forces, the controlling spirits of the moon, sun, stars, wind and rain still had the animal forms of the original gods. Therefore it happens that apparently incongruous animals are associated with agriculture; in China and India the tiger is the guardian of the crops; in Java it is the were-leopard; the hyaena guards the fields in East Africa. In north-western America the coyote-god listens to the rain-prayers of the Indians and repeats them to the Great Spirit; bear-, bison- and antelope-gods bring rain to the Hopi Indians (Webster, Primitive SecretSocieties, p.158, n.y). The jaguar, a sky-god, protects the cornfields in Yucatan; in Ecuador he is a sun-god; and a "weeping sky-god" in Argentina (Spinden, Lectures). Tree-, plant- and water-spirits also have the forms of animals. The various stages of animal-worship, tree- and plant-and sky-worship, overlap, coexist, and merge in away which presents a complicated picture. It was, in the writer's opinion, after man had begun to worship the growths of the earth and the heavenly pheonomena, that is to say, at a relatively late stage of development, that totemism appeared. The exact significance of totemism has heen the subject of much discussion and con- troversy, there being almost as many explanations as there are writers. Goldenweiser discusses some of the important definitions, of which the following is a brief summary:</page><page sequence="23">FIFTEEN Frazer held three different theories of totemism at various times of his life: i) the purpose of totemism was to provide a safe place for man's "external soul"; 2) totemism existed for the multiplication of the totem-animal by magical means; 3) totemism was a primitive ex- planation of conception and childbirth, which were misunderstood by early man who believed that conception in women was caused by spirits which dwelt in the places sacred to totems. Freud's explanation is that in very primitive times sons in a certain tribe murdered their despotic father, and then in remorse continued his restrictions, their feeling of guilt express- ing itself in worship of him; therefore the totem is really the father-image. Exogamy and sex tapus were invented as expiations for their crime. Schmidt believed that totemism originated in trade. Hill-Tout thought that it came from the worship of individual guardian-spirits. Ankermann held that it arose as a relief from the "drabness" of primitive life, together with the urge to dramatise the man-animal relationship. Goldenweiser's own theory is the pattern-theory. The gist of this is that, in a tribe composed of clans, the original animal-name, or sacred animal-connection, occurred in one or more of the clans, whereupon all the other clans eventually adopted it. New elements may have developed from within, or perhaps from without, and these again are diffused among all the clans. He thinks, however, that all the changes or additions may have developed in the original clan or clans. He points out that exogamy is almost invariably associated with totemism, and says that the sib system and totemism must be regarded as "adhesive phenomena" (Goldenweiser, Totemism). Hartland gives the elements of totemism as being: the clan; its animal- or plant-name; the mystic relation, often genetic, to the animal; the religious, or quasi-religious, emotional attitude toward the totem; the ceremonies in its honor; the clan's right to the totem's protection; the tapu against intermarriage. The "mystic kinship" has a very close connec- tion with the social organization (Hartland, Totemism). In L'Etat actuel du problems totemique, van Gennep analyses at some length a number of theories on the subject. A brief summary of some of these follows: Loisy: Totemism is a rudimentary form of social organisation closely connected with the cult of ancestors and with animal-worship. Rivers: Its psychological basis is identification with animals and plants. Risley: It is derived from exogamy, which is a particular form of the law of natural selection. Boas: Totemism cannot be explained by one formula, as its phenomena do not have the same origin, or even similar origins. Totemism " comes to be the association of varying types of ethnic activities with exogamy or endogamy." Durkheim: The names and symbols of the clan are derived from animals and plants most</page><page sequence="24">SIXTEEN abundant in that locality. The ceremonies, which concern the food-supply, arouse a sense of the sacred, and totemism becomes a genuine religion -the earliest type. Capart: The elements of totemism are: the relation of a group with some species in nature; alimentary tabus; exogamy; the custom of adopting the name of the animal-totem. Van Gennep: Only two elements are necessary: the idea and emotion leading to the institution of a relationship between a group and a species; and the localisation in a definite territory of the group and the animal-species. He emphasises the territorial element; the name is merely the consequence of every form of collective organisation. (Van Gennep, 0P. Cit., p. 343). Zelenin (the following is the gist of his resume in French of his book which is in Russian): The oldest element in history of the religion of Siberian peoples is the representation of evil spirits. From the bites of insects, small animals or snakes, taking place when a man was unaware of their presence, he became ill and conceived the idea of a secret enemy. Primitive man was especially impressed in the case of insects penetrating the skin so deeply that they were invisible beneath the swelling which they caused. Intestinal worms and parasites found on animals further convinced him. The original totem is the zoomorphic spirit of the illness which enters into the interior of men, causing the malady. Clan-totemism is the ideological reflection of the human clan in the animal-world. Matriarchal clans concluded agreements with the various animal-species similar to those made with other exogamous clans of their tribe, the object being to be preserved from illnesses. The idea of the totems as benevolent beings or as clan-ancestors came later. Totemism in Siberia is hardly existent, and has been replaced by the relatively recent cult of Ongons (idols), which is the real subject of the book (Zelenin, Le culte des Ongons, etc.). Some of these scholars have based their theories on material obtained from one particular field -Melanesia, Africa, North America, Australia, Siberia, etc. It may be noted that many of the definitions of totemism are descriptive rather than definitive; of the descriptive type, Hartland's is by far the best, in the writer's opinion. There seems to be some confusion between animal-worship and totemism; these seem to the writer to represent different states of mind at different stages of development. Goldenweiser's article Totemism was the springboard for the writer's own theory, which, however, in no way resembles his pattern theory. But his references to the early religious societies, his statement that "it must never be forgotten that the intensity of the religious attitude toward the totem is scarcely ever pronounced; also that totemism, in no instance, constitutes the whole or even the center of the religious aspect of a tribal culture" (op. cit., p.374); and his further statement that the sib system and totemism are "adhesive phenomena" (p. 3 80) seem to the writer to be significant clues pointing in a definite di- rection. The writer therefore offers the following theory of totemism:</page><page sequence="25">SEVENTEEN One must first go back to the early religious societies. These were groups, composed either of men or of women, but restricted practically always to one sex, which were named after an animal, bird, or object which has for the group the same religious significance, and which is the deity to whom they perform religious ceremonies. There is always more than one religious society within the tribe. Goldenweiser states a very significant fact: "The geographical distribution of religious societies suggests some relation to totemism. In a large number of totemic areas religious societies also occur" (op. cit.). Rivers, Goldenweiser says, believes that these religious societies developed out of a pre-existing totemism, basing this theory on data obtained on a certain Melanesian island. Webster considered that secret societies everywhere were merely totemism in decay. Goldenweiser himself holds that the two forms are "compatible", and gives the case of the southern Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia who alternately use both forms; the religious societies predominating in the winter, which is "the season of the secrets", while in the summer, the "profane season", the organisation of the tribe is that of the totemic clans. The amorphous quality of the societies may have suggested a breaking-down of the exacting and rigid forms of totemism, but, in the writer's opinion, this is not the case. The societies, far from being "totemism in decay", are much more ancient than totemism. The reasons for this opinion are that the formation of a group restricted as to sex is a much more primitive type of organisation than the clan; and furthermore the animal- or plant- god is worshipped by the members of the society, while the attitude of the clan toward the totem-animal is "quasi-religious". The totemic clans, as indicated by the geographical facts, developed from the religious societies, and from another cause to be discussed later. The Kwakiutl are a tribe in a transitional stage between the early religious groups and the later totemic clan. In the winter, they change their names and their whole social organisation. It is most significant that they follow the primitive religion in "the sacred season"; the later form in "the profane season". Evidences of the practices of the religious societies show that these include identity with the animal-god, which is not the case with totemism. The initiates of the Kwakiutl society become possessed by a frenzy: they attack animals with their nails and teeth, and sometimes human beings. In former times slaves were killed and eaten (Alexander, Secret Societies). When the Gonds of Bengal, who worship the tiger, are possessed by the tiger-spirit, they attack young goats and kill them with their teeth (Mac- Donell, Vedic Religion). The leopard-societies of Africa are well known. Van Gennep cites the case of an Aissaoui leopard-man who, when possessed by the leopard-spirit, killed a child. The Bey condemned him to death unless it could be proved that he was unconscious of the act. To test him his own child was placed in his path and the frenzied leopard-man tore his own son to pieces (van Gennep, op. cit., p. 251). A parallel case in Europe is found in The Bachantes of Euripides. Agave, daughter of Cadmus, is the leader of one of the</page><page sequence="26">EIGHTEEN bands of women-worshippers of Dionysus. They are roving through the countryside in a state of religious madness. No man is allowed to see their rites, but some herdsmen see the Bacchantes by accident while they are resting, and one of these describes them to Agave's son, Pentheus, ruler of Thebes. The Bacchantes' hair, the herdsman says, was unbound, they were clad in dappled fawn-skins girdled with snakes "that licked their cheeks." Some suckled wolf-cubs or gazelles. They see the herdsmen and rush toward them, but the men escape, and the Bacchantes attack their herds, "with hands that bore no weapon of steel". "Then wouldst thou have seen Agave mastering some sleek lowing calf, while others rent the heifers limb from limb. Before thy eyes there would have been hurling of ribs and hoofs this way and that; and strips of flesh, all blood bedabbled, dripped as they hung from the pine-branches. Wild bulls that glared but now with rage along their horns, found themselves tripped up, dragged down to earth by countless maidens' hands. The flesh upon their limbs was stripped therefrom quicker than thou couldst have closed thy royal eyelids" (Euripides, The Bacchantes, pp. 107 -9). Dionysus, who appears in human form in the tragedy, is called "the horned god", who wears a crown of snakes. He may appear as a bull, a lion, or a serpent with one hundred heads. To revenge himself on Pentheus, who has refused to worship him, the god leads Pentheus into the country to spy on the Bacchantes. Pentheus, although not knowing that his escort is Dionysus, has a momentary vision of the original animal-deity- "and thou, methinks, art a bull going before to guide me, and on thy head a pair of horns have grown. Wert thou really once a brute beast? Thou hast at any rate the appearance of a bull" (op. cit., p. 114). Dionysus, telling him that he will be brought back "in thy mother's arms," leads him on. Pentheus hides among the branches of a pine-tree. Dionysus tells the Bacchantes to take vengeance upon him. They hurl stones at him, then uproot the tree, and he falls to earth. Agave is the first to attack him. He cries out and implores in vain. "But she, the while, with foaming mouth and wildly rolling eyes, bereft of reason as she was, heeded him not; for the god possessed her." The frantic Bacchantes, thinking that he is a lion, tear him limb from limb in a most horrible way. Agave takes the head, impales it on her thyrsus, and returns in triumph to the palace, where she calls for her son, "And where is Pentheus, my son? Let him bring a ladder and raise it against the house to nail up on the gables this lion's head, my booty from the chase" (op. Cit., p. 123). Another instance of the survival of an early religious society in Greece is the group of women and girls who worshipped the Brauronian Artemis, who was originally a bear. In historical times this was apparently a fecundity cult; no girl could marry unless she had taken part in the rites, during which the followers wore bearskins. The hind that was sacrificed suggests an original human sacrifice. Another religious society again restricted to women was that of the Bassarides, who worshipped Dionysus in the form of a fox. Greece</page><page sequence="27">NINETEEN is one of the countries which did not develop totemism, but the survivals of animal-worship and the religious societies had great persistence. The religious societies developed, in the writer's opinion, from the original mystic animal- worship in a period when an increase in population with the assurance which numbers bring, and a more settled mode of life, caused primitive man to begin to feel a sense of identity with his own kind which had hitherto been unknown to him. This led to the group-consciousness which was the cause of the formation of the sex-groups. There was still the sense of identity with the animal-god, and probably no feeling of personal identity. The group-consciousness increases, and begins to include other groups in the clan, develop- ing into the sense of "brother-sister kin", which, according to Hartland, is the meaning of the original term "ototeman", a word of the Ojibwa and related Algonquin tribes (Hartland, op. cit.). The groups become mystically brothers and sisters; therefore as all the marriageable women in his clan are his sisters, a man must go outside the clan to marry. The extensive interpretation of the idea of incest, and the horror with which it was regarded, are based upon this feeling of identification as a brother of all the marriageable women of one's group. Marriage therefore is necessarily exogamous; it is more and more attended by regulations and tapus, resulting in great complexities of relationship. All this means that man more than ever before is concerned with human affairs, which increasingly identify him with his own species. Any social change involves a strong consciousness of the human race as such; group-consciousness begins to develop into the clan-ego; the emphasis begins to shift from the animals to man; and by degrees the divine animal becomes merely sacred, though its connection with man is still very close and may often be genetic. But the attitude of worship has now a reciprocal element; there is an obligation on the totem to aid and protect the clan. The writer's definition of totemism would therefore be: Totemism is the secular- isation of animal-worship, due to man's increasing feeling of identity with his own kind, and combined with certain manifestations of this new attitude. Totemism is therefore probably the first instance of that "progressive secularisation" which is, according to Reinach, the history of humanity. (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 21). The organisation has been of long duration, as totems of plants, trees, water, etc., are found, which represent a later stage than the original animal-totem. One may therefore from the totem deduce the stage of development of the clan. In Australia this is very clear-cut; in southeast Australia the totems are animals; in the south, the center, and south QUeensland they are both animals and plants, but the animals are in the majority; with the Aruntas the two types of totems are about equal; in northern Australia, as in New Guinea, the plant-totems outnumber the animals. Some forms of totemism are more or less complete today; some are much disintegrated. The emphasis is various: with the Lobos of South China it is on the tapus, and a man wishing to ascertain the clan of another man, will ask:</page><page sequence="28">TWENTY "What is it you don't touch?" (Hartland, Totemism). The dramatic ritual is the em- phasised feature with the Bechuana tribes of South Africa, and in the same circumstances a Bechuana of the monkey, alligator or fish clan will ask another: "What do you dance?" (Hartland, Bantu, etc.). Sometimes the totem of the wife's family is added to that of the husband; sometimes there may be four or five subsidiary totems. Inconsistencies arise, as, for instance, with the Melanesian Sea-eagle clan, whose ancestor is the fruit-pigeon, which is tapu, though the clan may kill the sea-eagle (Codrington, Melanesians). The totem may or may not be genetic. It may split, eventually dwindling to only a part of the animal; the Bear clan of the Algonquin Indians say that they are descended from the paw of the Bear (Hartland, Totemism). In Alaska, the so-called totem-poles, regarded as "idols" by the ignorant nineteenth-century missionaries, have not in most cases a religious significance. Keithahn distinguishes six different types, of which the mortuary poles are religious; religious symbols appear on some of the others, which are records of mythological or ancestral legends. There are also memorial and honorary poles (Keithahn, Monuments, p.41). The modern totem-poles, the products of "present-day" Indians, are entirely secular and social in significance, and have been described by Dr. Stirling in an admirable phrase as being "proclamations of prestige" (Stirling, Indians of our North Pacific Coast. Nat. Geog., Jan. 1 945). Totemism disintegrates, but the original animal-worship has extraordinary vitality. The great civilisations of antiquity all have either traces of it, survivals, or the ancient religion itself. As instances, Sumer, Egypt and India will be briefly discussed; China will be consider- ed in Chapter IV. S U M E R The discovery of the Sumerian civilisation is fairly recent, and the indications are that it is more ancient than that of Egypt. The origin of the Sumerians is so far unknown; they appear first on the flat lands of Mesopotamia, but their language suggests a mountain-origin, there being only one word for "mountain" and for "land". The Sumerian language "stands alone and unrelated to any language, living or dead" (Kramer, Sumerian Mythology, p.21). The oldest inscription so far discovered can be dated approximately between 3200-2800 B. C. (p. iii). Langdon says that primitive Sumerian inscriptions of "almost pre-historic" times contain no type of names which reflect lower stages of culture (Langdon, Name, etc.), a fact which means a long continuous previous history. By way of contrast it may be noted that in Iran, at a much later date, the names of Zoroaster, his convert, Prince Vishtaspa, and their families all refer to horses, camels, etc. (Carnoy, Zoroastrianism). The divinities of ancient Sumer were anthropomorphic. Kramer gives their cosmogony as follows:</page><page sequence="29">TWENTY-ONE Nammu, the primeval sea, uncreated and eternal, gives birth to heaven and earth, which united form a mountain "whose base was the bottom of the earth, and whose peak was the top of the heavens." The heaven, Anu, and the earth, Ki, had a son, Enlil, the air-god, se- parator of heaven and earth. Anu carried off heaven, and Enlil carried off the earth Ki, and from his union with her came life on earth and order in the universe. Enlil was the father of Nannar, the moon-god, who was the father of the sun-god Utu. Enlil was also the father of the god of wisdom, Enki, who is also the water-god, as his mother was Nammu, the primeval sea. He raised the city Eridu from the waters and was the father of many deities, among them the goddess of plants, Uttu. There are other gods and goddesses, of whom the most important historically are Inanna and Dumuzi; Inanna, the mother-goddess, deity of the evening star, goddess of love, fertility and war, daughter of Anu, later said to be daughter of Enki; and Dumuzi, her son and lover, a shepherd-king, a fisherman, associated with the "abyss", and also a vegetation-god who dies and is resurrected annually. As the language and literature of Sumer was studied for centuries by the Babylonians, Assyrians, Elamites, Hurrians, Hittites and Canaanites (Kramer, op. cit., p. 29), Sumer's fountain of religious beliefs flowed into far countries. The cults of Inanna and Dumuzi, proto-types of the Babylonian Ishtar and Tammuz, had, through the latter divine pair, a profound influence on Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, Palestine, Phoenicia, Phrygia, Egypt, Crete and Greece. Though the anthropomorphic gods are supreme when Sumer enters history, there are traces of animal-worship which show that the ancient religion had previously existed. Clay images of swine, cattle, and sheep have been found in proto-Sumerian graves; it is uncertain whether these were wild or domesticated animals. The frog, scorpion, and porcupine appear on the pottery of Abu Shahrain, the site of Eridu. It is most significant that Langdon, writing on Sumerian names in the early literature, says that "animal-names have also disappeared, except in the names of the gods (italics by the present writer), most of whom have preserved animal-attributes and were frequently referred to by animal-titles." (Langdon, Name). Swine are associated with several of the deities; the sun-god Utu is called Shubar (pig)-Utu; the goddess Bau is Shubar-Bau. Inanna's faithful attendant is Ninshubar, Lord of Pigs. An ancient swine-cult may be inferred from this and from other evidences in Babylonia. The Babylonians were in closer contact with the Sumerians and more profoundly influenced by them than were any other people. It was probably due to Sumerian influence that they were the only Semites to whom the pig was not tapu; on the contrary, swine were honored, kept in temple-grounds and used for purposes of divination (Farbridge, Swine). Inanna's sacred animal is the lion, which indicates an early lion-cult, and is connected with her aspect as goddess of war; the two lions, crossing each other's bodies, which are found on the cylinder seals, being a symbol of war (Langdon, Op. cit., p. u16). The serpent</page><page sequence="30">TWENTY-TWO is also one of her early symbols (op. cit., p. io8). Her lovers, the horse, the lion, and the Alalu bird, whom she treated so cruelly, may be survivals of deities which she replaced. Doves are associated with her as with all the mother-goddesses in the Near East, and in other countries as well. With the Akan of Ashanti, Africa, doves are the creatures "nearest to" the Supreme Deity Nyame, ancestress of mankind, and Mother of the Sun, who is also her soul. On particular occasions doves are sacrified to her (Meyrowitz, The Sacred State of the Akan, pp. 92, 1 8 5). The lists of spirits found at Shurippak, include the spirits of various young animals: gazelles, lions, and the "dun-animal", which, in Langdon's opinion, was bos bubalis, and in Barton's was the pig. Apparently the bull was domesticated and worshipped in the Near East first in Sumer; the Babylonians used Sumerian terms for the divine bull. The animal was unknown to the early Semites; the Hebrews used the Babylonian word for "wild bull" (Sayce, Bull, Semitic). The animal was a solar symbol; it was the Bull of Anu, the Bull of Heaven. Sacrificial animals mentioned are bulls, rams, and doves. A passage in the inscription on the Vulture Stela implies that wild bulls were used for sacrifice to the sun-god: "Utu, king of abundant brilliance, at Larsa, in Ebarbar, with a captured bullock I fed" (Barton, Royal Inscriptions, etc., p. 31). The doves were apparently always sacrificed in pairs; "their necks and heads were offered as incense" (Barton, op. cit., p. 29). The description of the construction, directed by Gudea, of the great temple to Ningirsu, patron-god of the city of Lagash, contains many examples of animal-imagery and animal- symbolism. Ningirsu is addressed as "0 warrior, ravening lion !" (p. 205). The ass, honored throughout the Near East, was also venerated in Sumer: "For Ensignum, the ass-herd of Ningirsu, his temple of the ass's foal I built" (p. 175). Gudea has a dream which he asks Nina, the goddess of protective oracles, to interpret; in this dream the ass represents Gudea himself (p. 211). The moon, Nannar, whose worship preceded that of the sun, is associated with the cow: "Like the cow of Nannar" (p. 225); "Nannar, the great calf of Anu" (p. 273). The celestial serpent is probably referred to in this sentence, " ...... may Nannar the serpent set upon him" (p. 29i). There is also a serpent of the mountain, which may be the same as the earth- serpent, the agent of the goddess Ninke (p.3 1), and the harvest-producing serpent: " ..... the wise serpent which produces the harvest he (Gudea) brought forth from the temple" (p. 239). Bulls protect the building: " ..... a shaded temple-terrace with oxen as watchful guardians" (p. 289). All the herd-animals are sacred. At the beginning of the harvest Nina "placed the mark on a black pregnant ewe; she raised it up to heaven and shut it in the fold" (p. 239); . that holy ewes may bring forth lambs, that rams might cover their holy ewes, that holy cows may bring forth calves" (p. :5i); "The holy goat, the goat that suckled the lamb of</page><page sequence="31">TWENTY-THREE lulim-sheep" (p. 245). The goat was associated with a particularly sacred tree; "With tamarisk and the mountain-goat-tree, which is the product of heaven, they consecrated Eninnu, they made it holy" (p. 239). Gudea, who has directed his attention to the construction of the temple "like a cow that keeps her eyes on her calf" (p. 225), finally completes it. It is like the new moon; it shines like the sun-god; "he built it like a mountain of lapis lazuli; like a mountain of bright marble, and he stood to admire it" (p. 23 i). The temple is described in vivid terms of animal-imagery: "Its lofty pile, like a wild ox, rose up, its mass crouched like a lion ....... its guard-house(s) like the holy ibex of the abyss he made brilliant ..... The lofty mass of the temple he had constructed was like the great dragon of the deep; the divine sanctuary of the temple as the black water of a great marsh lay low as a water-snake; the long facade of the temple rose as a divine leopard" (p. 231). At the warrior's gate Gudea placed six warrior-chiefs, "who outshine the six-headed mountain-goat." A favorable dragon was stationed at the brilliant gate of Shugalem. "Toward the rising sun in the destined place the emblem of the sun-god, the chief ram, he established." At the river-bank gate he placed "the lion which is the terror of the gods." The Companion- in-heaven, which is the divine black storm-bird, was housed "in the place of the oracle". A bull and a ram were placed in the temple of the goddess Bau (p. 233). The entrance of Ningirsu's temple was apotropaic: "The door-posts of Eninnu were demons; the door-hinges were lions; for its bolt a terrible serpent in a cave, its tongue protruding like a wild ox." There was a Khua bird resting on lions as a door-socket, and the nails which protruded from "the holy beams" were in the form of dragon-men (p. 233). Besides the guardian bulls on the terrace of the temple, "the divine black storm-bird with the mountain-serpent protected it" (p. 235). The divine brilliant black storm-bird, the companion of Ningirsu, has preserved the original character of divinity more than any other animal. Ningirsu's temple, Eninnu, is referred to in inscriptions on several bricks as "the Eninnu of his divine bright black storm-bird"; and again the temple is attributed to the storm-bird: "O divine black storm-bird, thy temple is raised up for thee!" (p. 255). The Sumerians had two words meaning "soul". The idiograms represent a reed by running water, signifying life; and an eye, meaning the vigor of life (Barton, Soul, etc.). These terms must have applied only to the souls of the living. The colorful and impassioned qualities of the Sumerian epics end with life; the conception of the after-life is dreary. The soul departs to an underground world, "the land of no return", where, in winged form like a bird, it flies in imprisoned darkness; wretched and resentful, it becomes hostile and malevolent to the living. The conception of immortality in the Near East seems to have been distrustful or entirely absent until a late date. In Sumer, death is doom; even the gods are powerless before it. Like the living, they fear the spirits of the dead. Anu, the sky-god,</page><page sequence="32">TWENTY-FOUR yields to Inanna when she threatens to set free the spirits of the dead and let them roam over the world. Enki, the god of wisdom, is the only deity powerful enough to rescue Inanna when she is a captive in the under-world. When she finally ascends into the land of the living, demons walk at her side, ghosts precede her. They are harmful spirits, Who take away the wife from the loins of man, Who take away the child from the breast of the nursing mother." (Kramer, op. Cit., p. 95) However, when the shade of Enkidu is allowed to return to the upper world for a brief space, his answers to Gilgamesh's questions show that some souls had more fortunate fates in the after-world. Happiness seems to have depended largely upon the number of one's sons. Those who had four, five, or six sons were contented; he who had seven sons was treated "as one close to the gods" (Kramer, op.cit., p. 37). The three seals illustrated show the beneficent Bird-deity Imdugud, who is the symbol of the God of Fertility, and whose form is that of a bird with a lion's head; and three an- thropomorphised Bird-forms, who are all probably representations of Zu, the evil bird who stole a plant symbolising, according to Frankfort, immortality (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, p. 136). On the earliest seal (PI. II, A), the sun-god is seen in his boat, preceded by what is presumably the human-headed lion, and followed by a Bird-man, apparently holding a twig or branch. Of the two registers of B the upper shows two human-headed Bulls attacked respectively by Imdugud and a winged lion; and a stag. In the lower register is a figure, which Frankfort designates as a monkey, playing the flute, a lion attacking a bull, a small antelope, the human-headed lion with the plow, and a Bird-figure with a human head and human arms holding a trident. This Bird-man, according to Frankfort, may represent Zu, the trident being a symbol of the stolen plant (Op. cit., p. 73). The seal has a curiously Victorian quality. C shows Zu captured and brought before Enki, the Water-god, who holds his symbol, a vase with flowing waters. In this case, Zu, standing between his captors, the foremost of whom is the double-faced god Usmo, Enki's particular attendant, is more human than on the earlier seals. He has a wing instead of a garment, one human leg and bird's feet. On other seals he may be represented as a man with a bird of prey, or as a bird of prey alone. There seem to have been tutelary spirits which aided the living. "The faithful shepherd, Gudea, was very wise; he undertook great things; his favorable demon went before him; his gracious guardian deity walked behind him" (Barton, Op. Cit., p. 237). Gatekeepers also seem to have had some supernatural significance (Kramer, Op. Cit., pp. z1-z5); and again when Nannar, the moon-god, arriving at the "lapis lazuli quay"' of his father Enlil, the air- god, addresses the gatekeeper as "0 protecting genie" (K~ramer, Op. Cit., p. 48).</page><page sequence="33">TWENTY-FIVE EGYPT ((L'importance d'un phenomene religieux ne se mesure pas seulement a travers ce qui reste de traditions ecrites ou orales, mais aussi et surtout par la place qu'il occupe dans 'art figure)), (Hentze, Objets Rituels, etc., p. 18). Though the Egyptians attained a high degree of civilisation and culture; though they had an official religion with a monarch who was a god, and a powerful priesthood; though sun- worship and other phases of nature worship existed, their ((art figure)) shows that the basic preoccupations of the Egyptians were the two primeval concepts of the collective uncon- scious -the divinity of animals and the life of the soul after death. To them, all animals, birds, reptiles, insects, had an intrinsic quality of divinity; that is to say, they had retained the attitude of the primeval consciousness from which the two concepts were originally evolved. Whether it is a question of the gods or of the soul, the Egyptians were unable to conceive of divinity without the animal-image. Their religious art - and their literature- shows the characteristic primitive mingling of the mystical and the concrete; the Egyptians make tangible and articulate some of the feelings of inarticulate early man as to the mystery and magnification of the divine animals. They have expressed the two earliest concepts in the grand manner. Frankfort refers to the fact that there was never an uprising among the Egyptian people, attributing this to the "supernatural character of kingship" (Frankfort, Kingship, etc., p. 52); in the writer's opinion this was because their feeling of exclusive identity with the human race was by no means complete, and their sense of general identity with the animal-world very strong. They thought in terms of animals, which were magnified to cosmic dimensions; a cow, or a pig, becomes the sky; a bull is the sun; a beetle is the sun-god. Totemism has been suggested for Egypt; the writer cannot agree; this is animal-worship, not totemism. There are no signs of the "adhesive phenomena"; the Egyptians were not exogamous, but endogamous to the degree that not only the Pharaohs married their sisters, but among commoners marriages between brothers and sisters were the rule and not the exception (Frazer, Adonis, etc., p. 214). The exogamous horror of incest did not exist; in connection with which it is interesting to note Dr. Jung's statement that the "motif of incest" in the subconscious often signifies the longing for immortality (Frankfort, op. cit., Chap. 14, n. 8i). The Egyptians spent much of life in preparation for this desired immortality. They ex- emplify Stanley Cook's statement that "endogamy made for solidarity, unity and oneness, where exogamy avoided the physical and psychological effects of any close unity and made for the movement and exchange of ideas" (Cook, Religion etc.). Intensity is more character- istic of Egyptian ideas than movement or exchange. Many primitive elements remain in their religion; for instance, the belief in the identity of the image with what it represents to 4</page><page sequence="34">TWENTY-SIX the extent that the standards of the gods actually were the gods themselves. Frankfort cites the instance of offerings being made to the standard of Amon (op. cit., p. 44). They retained various beliefs and customs still found among African tribes; they venerated a beetle as the sun-god; the Hottentots sacrificed bulls and sheep to a beetle. Horus, the Hawk divinity, is mystically identical with every living Pharaoh; Nyakang, the divine ancestor with crocodile- attributes, is immanent in every king of the Shilluks of the White Nile. The ritual slaying of an old, or an ill, ruler is still practised by the Shilluk and the Dinka tribes; it survives in Egypt as the Sed Festival of the king's rejuvenation. It is significant that the final rupture between Ikhnaton and the priests of Amon took place when the Pharaoh dedicated the Sed Festival to the Solar Disc instead of to one of the ancient divinities, originally animal- gods. Sun-worship is usually dominating, but in Egypt it failed to absorb the earlier religion. In the pre-dynastic graves are found hawks, the worship of which is very ancient; the earliest known capital is Hawk-town, whose ruler was known only by the name of Hawk. The other two most important animals of this period are the lion and the ubiquitous snake. The lion is distinguished from later representations by having a tail which turns up and ends in a hook; this is reminiscent of certain Sumerian seals of the Uruk period (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, Pl. IV, a, i, 1: P1. V, a). The hippopotamus was also important in the pre- dynastic period, and other animals represented were the frog, scorpion, locust, elephant, bull, stag and hare. Bulls' heads and flies appeared as amulets. Dogs, though not depicted, are often found buried in the graves (Petrie, Egyptian Religion). A grave in which a dog is buried with a person has been found at Eridu, and Pelliot gives instances of the same type of burial at An-yang in China (Pelliot, Royal Tombs of An-yang etc., p. 54). The number of divine animals increases in the First Dynasty and includes the cheetah, serval, cat, bull, ram, hippopotamus, jackal, ichneumon, crocodile, shrew-mouse, hawk, vulture, wagtail, cobra, python, and several fishes (Petrie, op. cit.). In some cases the worship was local. In the course of time practically every species of animal seems to have been wor- shipped in some locality but certain deities, particularly the hawk and the vulture, the bull and the cow, dominated the others in extent and power. Worship of the hawk was universal; the bird was a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes. It was Horus, the god with whom eyery living Pharaoh was mystically identical. The prevalence of hawk- and Horus-worship in the nomes is noticeable. Sethe considers that hawk-worship originated in the third nome of Lower Egypt, where the worship is very primitive. This nome is on the west shore of the Delta, on the extreme northwest (Barton, quoting Sethe, Semitic and Hamitic Origins, p. 184). This nome and the twentieth of Lower Egypt, Barton thinks, are the oldest in the Delta. In the twentieth nome also the hawk appears. The followers of Horus, those shadowy souls of former Pharaohs, were divided into the souls of Pe from Lower Egypt and the *</page><page sequence="35">TWENTY-SEVEN souls of Nekhen of Upper Egypt. The souls of Pe were hawk-headed, which suggests that the earliest association of the hawk was with Lower Egypt. The souls of Nekhen had the heads of wolves. Horus is shown only as a hawk until the Fourth or Fifth Dynasty, when he begins to appear as a human being with a hawk's head. A very late combination of two ancient deities occurs in a beautiful figure, of the crocodile-god with the hawk's head, of the second century A. D. (P1. IV). The vulture, goddess of maternity, is a symbol of Upper Egypt, and forms the crown of that region. It is associated with the goddess of childbirth, Nekbet, in the third nome of Upper Egypt. It seems to the writer that there may be a connection between the vulture- goddess and the terra-cotta figurines of bird-headed, steatopygous women, with uplifted arms, found at Mohameriah, near Edfu (PI. III), and with the vulture-headed women in Bushman paintings (Stow and Bleek, Rock Painting, etc., Pls. 6, 40). Worship of the bull and the cow was universal. Space forbids the recounting of the similarities between Egypt and the cattle-raising tribes of Africa in this regard. It may be stated that cattle-cemeteries existed from an early period; they are found in the neolithic Badarian culture; that the bull was sometimes identified with the chief, who was buried in the cattle kraal; that the bull was sometimes called "the great god". In Egypt the cow and the bull are expanded into heavenly images. The cow with long horns is the sky, the bull is the sun, and the rising sun is their calf The Pharaoh sometimes appears as a bull, as on the Narmer-Menes palette (Quibell and Green, Hierakonpolis, II, P1. XXVIII). A hymn describes how King Teti's soul on its way to the after-life crosses the great intervening waters by grasping the tail of the Bull of Heaven: "Teti has caught thy tail because Teti is really a god, the son of a god" (Pyramid Texts, quoted by Frankfort, op. cit., p. 170). The divinity of the bull could be approached only by a god. Unlike most other peoples, the Egyptians did not conceive of the earth as mother; the earth was a male god, and the mother was the cow, so completely and divinely that every Pharaoh must be born of the cow. Each king therefore is the son of the cow-goddess, Hathor, mother of Horus. This does not at all conflict with the hawk-Horus identity of the Pharaoh as the son of Isis and Osiris, nor with his being the son of Nut, the sky, or of Nekhbet, the vulture-goddess. There is nothing inconsistent in these flowing multiple identities; personality does not exist, there is only the permeating reality of divinity. Hathor, the mother-cow-goddess, is evi- denly very ancient in origin, since she derives not from the domesticated cow, but from the wild cow of the marshes. She appears as a cow, or as a woman with cow's horns. On the predynastic Narmer palette only her face is human; the horned head, ears, and body are those of a cow (Quibell and Green, op. cit., II, P1. XXVIII). It is curious to note that the mother of the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh, the goddess Ninsun, is also a wild cow ( Langdon, op. cit., p. I IS).</page><page sequence="36">TWENTY-EIGHT The Egyptians, like many other peoples in both hemispheres, believed in a multiplicity of souls. In Egypt there were three, two of which had animal-forms, in both cases being birds; the third soul was an exact image of the individual person. The soul called the Khu appeared only after death and was the heavenly soul. Its pictograph is a crested ibis, and though Frankfort says that the Khu was "not thought of as a bird" (Frankfort, op. cit., p. 64), it seems to the writer that, given the intense mystical animal-worship of the Egyptians, and the universal association of the bird with the soul, the ibis originally represented the exact form of the departed spirit. The ibis-soul is older than the second bird-soul, the Ba, which is a bird with a human head appearing in the 2nd millenium, B. C. This soul remains near the tomb; though it may fly away for a time it always returns. Petrie considers that it was derived from the white owls which haunt Egyptian tombs (Petrie, Transmigration). Before this a bird with a human head had appeared on a cylinder seal in Sumer in the Third Early Dynastic period (PI. II, B). There are instances in Asia of one soul going to heaven, and one remaining by the grave. The souls of people other than the Pharaoh might take the forms of other animals or plants. The Book of the Dead states that souls may be transformed into a golden hawk, a divine hawk, a heron, a swallow, an earthworm, or a crocodile (Petrie, op. cit.). An illustration of the Egyptian absorption in the two earliest concepts may be found, in the writer's opinion, in the case of Isis and Osiris. They differ from the other gods. Speaking of Osiris, Isis and Horus, Frankfort says "gods so strikingly human are without parallel in Egypt" (op. cit., p. 4o). Their origin in Egypt is problematical. Barton, Petrie, Langdon and Childe believe in an Asiatic origin; Newberry says that it is now "generally agreed" that the prototype of Osiris was Andjety, primitive deity of Dedu-Busiris, in the eastern Delta, whose attributes of the crook and the so-called flail are those of Osiris (Newberry, The Shepherd's Crook, etc.). Frankfort repudiates both these theories of origin, and maintains that Osiris was originally a dead king of Upper Egypt (Op. Cit., p. I97-8). The writer cannot see the slightest evidence for this last theory; indeed Frankfort himself states that the worship of the royal ancestors was a worship of collectivity, and that this form was never superseded (op. cit., p. 9o). The souls of the dead kings are an eternal, vague and unpersonalised group; and that in this early era the impersonal Egyptians should arbitrarily isolate the soul of one nebulous king seems to the writer hardly credible. More- over, Osiris was known first in Lower Egypt, and claimed very much later by Upper Egypt; he is associated with Abydos only as late as the Middle Kingdom period. Concerning the theory that Andjety was the prototype of Osiris, it seems to the writer that this theory lacks the completion of motivation. It is immediately evident that some great afflatus would be required to expand an unknown local deity into a god of all Egypt. Judging by the static, conservative nature of Egyptian psychology, and by the types of</page><page sequence="37">TWENTY-NINE deities which the Egyptians had already evolved, it seems most probable that the impetus which made Osiris a powerful divinity came from an external source. Frankfort speaks of the First Dynasty as being "accompanied by the momentous introduction of writing, by the technological advance of a large-scale use of metal tools, by the new modes of expres- sion of monumental art-in short, by the thorough-going changes from a peasant-culture" (op. cit., p. 15). These changes were less likely, in the writer's opinion, to have risen suddenly and independently in Egypt than to have been suggested and stimulated by contact with Sumer, which had already developed writing, the use of metal, and a monumental art. Langdon states that "Sumerian linear pictographic writing seems to have been introduced into Egypt in pre-dynastic times" (Langdon, Semitic Mythology, p. 372). Sethe believed in a Delta culture. It is significant that both writing and the calendar originated in the Delta; significant, and most natural, since that was the part of the country nearest to Sumer with its superior civilisation, whereas the neighbors of Upper Egypt were tribes of a lower culture than that of Egypt. In discussing the pre-dynastic period Peet says that from about eight miles south of Cairo up to Nubia the civilisation seems to have been quite homogeneous until the Dynastic period "when a distinct tendency to fall behind is observed in Nubia" (Peet, Egypt; the Pre-Dynastic Period, p. 247)-another indication that the new cultural influence came from the north. The Narmer palette bears witness to contact with Sumer; beneath the figure of the king wearing the crown of Lower Egypt is a symbol well-known on cylinder seals of the Uruk period,-two confronted lions with greatly elongated inter- twined necks (Quibell and Green, Hierakonpolis, II, PI. XXVIII). The theory of an Asiastic origin for Osiris and Isis seems the most probable one to the writer. Andjety, who ruled over the eastern provinces, those nearest to Sumer, may have been the vehicle by which Dumuzi entered Egypt. Frankfort comments on the fact that Osiris had no field which was entirely his own; he was associated with the earth, the sun, the Nile, grain, fertility, but he was not the representative god in any of these cases; each field had its own particular deity (op. cit., p. 185). Do these facts suggest an indigenous god? Dumuzi was a shepherd-god; a fisherman; he was associated with vegetation, growth, water; he died and was resurrected. Do not the facts rather suggest a foreign deity introduced into an already established pantheon, and allowed, because of the similarity of his powers, to participate in the functions of several of the gods without being representative of them? Osiris only finds his province, he becomes truly Egyptian only when he is associated with one of the two primitive concepts. In his case, the power of resurrection of plant-life of the original god is associated with the resurrected souls of the dead, and Osiris becomes the god of the dead, or to be more accurate, the god of eternal life, the god whom every Pharaoh becomes at death. He is then a vital part of the soul-concept. The Sed Festival also indicates a foreign origin for Osiris. This ritual had become in</page><page sequence="38">THIRTY Egypt a ceremony to renew the Pharaoh's powers, but it is obviously of composite nature. It was evidently very ancient in origin; the buildings made for it were of predynastic reed- construction; it was also of Upper Egyptian origin, as the wolf-god priests, and the Upwaut standards, had most important roles. Osiris was not present, but his predecessor, Anubis, was; this seems to indicate that the ceremony originated before the arrival of Osiris in Egypt, and that it was so ancient and so deeply established in Upper Egypt that in this instance the original god Anubis still held his place, though in others he had been displaced by Osiris. Inanna, the proto-type of Isis, was the mother and the wife of Dumuzi; Isis follows the pattern of Egyptian endogamy by becoming the sister and the wife of Osiris. She is a pale reflection of the "pure Inanna". Isis is the mother of Horus; she conceives him in the form of a hawk; then, since the mother is always the cow, she borrows the horns of Hathor; she is merged into the divine-animal concept. The power and the duration of animal-worship in Egypt are extraordinary. This is illustrated on a stela described by Miss Scott in a most interesting article (Scott, The Metter- nich Stela). The stela was made about 350 B.C., in the reign of the last Pharaoh. It is a talisman for protection against evil animals, particularly reptiles. On the front is a bas-relief with the infant Horus in the center, holding in his right hand a snake, a scorpion and an oryx, in his left a snake, a scorpion and a lion, and standing on crocodiles. It will be noted that these are all very ancient divinities; the snake, crocodile and scorpion are among the oldest gods, if not the oldest; the lion is pre-dynastic; and the oryx is probably the "horned deer" which was also frequent in the pre-dynastic period (Baumgartel, Cultures, p. 30). The incantations are for protection against the three reptiles, but the primitive dual attitude remains, and the reptiles appear as potential enemies and, simultaneously, in the case of the snake and scorpion, as protectors. Horus appears twice seated on the crocodile. This dual attitude remains in many religions; India has striking examples. The ancient Tahitians gave it the most poetic expression in the name of one of their gods, "Sacredness-holding-anger". On the stela Thoth prays, "repulse from me every lion of the desert"; while Min says, "I am.... the lion of the western mountains."7 One of the incantations is to aid a cat which has been stung by a scorpion. Every part of the cat is placed under the protection of a god: "O cat, your head is the head of Re.... o cat, your eyes are the eyes of the Lord of the Glorious Eye.... 0 cat, your nose is the nose of Thot", etc. Miss Scott says that the cat was presumably identified with a goddess. Such identification does not seem to have been always necessary, judging by instances like the two following: Gabra describes an animal-cemetery which is beside a cemetery for human beings. The part containing the animals was called ((le quartier des Esprits Supe- rieurs)); it had a temple, a space behind it for the sacred animals, and long subterranean</page><page sequence="39">THIRTY-ONE galleries in which they were placed after death (Gabra, Aspecte du culte des animaux); Diodorus Siculus says that in time of famine the Egyptians ate human beings rather than any of the divine animals (Sumner, quoting Diodorus, Cannibalism). INDIA The earliest civilisation so far discovered in India is that of the Indus Valley, where the most important sites excavated are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. In contrast to conditions in Sumer and Egypt, these cities contain neither temples nor religious monuments. They were apparently thriving commercial centers. The similarity of the dwelling-houses and the absence of weapons of warfare imply an equality of wealth shared by peaceful inhabitants. In both places the population was heterogeneous; Harappa contains graves whose skeletons indicate a variety of races; this is also true of the very few graves found at Mohenjo-daro where, so far, no cemeteries have been discovered. Recent excavations have unearthed a "citadel" at Harappa outside the town; and a wall around the large Buddhist stupa-mound outside Mohenjo-daro (Emenau, quoting R. M. S. Wheeler, in review of Kroeber's Anthropology, etc.). Emenau agrees with Wheeler that temples will be found in these excavations. Dikshit had previously suggested that the stupa-mound near Mohenjo-daro might contain an early Indus Valley shrine (Dikshit, Prehistoric etc., P. 5). It seems possible to the writer that the wall-site might disclose a cemetery. As there are no evidences of temples or of a priesthood in the two sites, so there are also no evidences of palaces or kings. The material so far discovered is all on a small scale: seals, sealings, amulets, statuettes, figurines, and pottery. It is very similar in both sites, but Harappa, the older and more interesting of the two, contains objects which, according to Vats, are older than any found at Mohenjo-daro, as well as a type of burial-urn which is not found at the later site. This earliest material found in a deep stratum at Harappa consists of miniature seals, the majority of which have representations of animals. Among these the crocodile appears most frequently, which is probably another instance of the antiquity of reptile-deities. The hare, the fish, and the goat follow numerically in that order. One seal has a pipal-leaf, and there are several with the so-called "incense-burner", which will be discussed later. Though they do not disappear entirely, the animals on these early seals are superseded on the later seals by a completely different group which includes bulls of three distinct species, the water-buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger, and ibex. It is at the stage of these later cult-animals that the history of Mohenjo-daro apparently begins. In both sites the most important animal-deity is a certain type of bull, which is represented on the seals and sealings more often than all the other animals combined.</page><page sequence="40">THIRTY-TWO This bull is distinguished by being depicted with a single horn, and a long neck adorned with a series of parallel ring-like lines; sometimes the shoulder is outlined by two parallel lines, and occasionally a design suggesting a saddle-cloth appears on the body. Marshall has called this animal a "unicorn", but the conventions of depicting one horn to represent two, or two legs to represent four, are so ancient, widespread and continuous that there seems to be no reason to regard the animal as other than a bull. Many examples of the single horn signifying both horns could be given: in Reinach's Repertoire de l'Art Quaternaire they exist at Bruniquel, P. 37; Castillo, PP. 45, 49; Combarelles, p. 6o; Font de Gaume, PP. 76, 79; Gourdan, p. 87; Les Hoteaux, p.95; Lourdes, P. i33; Mas d'Azil, P. . The convention is used on Sumerian seals (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, PI. III, b, e; PI. IV, a, c, k, 1, m; P1. V, f; P1. VI, a, b, d; PI. VIII, a, h); at Tell Halaf(Von Oppenheim, Tell Halaf, P1. VIII, a; PI. XXXI, a; Color Plate III, 1, 3). On this plate gazelles with neck-rings and saddle-cloths appear. The Encyclopedie Photographique illustrates an Achaemenian example from Susa (Vol. II, P1. XII, 2). Moreover, the bull on the Indus Valley seals sometimes appears with both horns (Marshall, Mohenjo-daro XII, 24; CVIII, 169; CXVI, 29; CXVIII, il; Mackay, Further Excavations, etc., LXXXIII, 3; LXXXIV, 67; LXXXVI, 234; LXXXVIII, 272). The term which Mackay uses for the animal is the "urus bull". Since this bull is the predominating symbol in the culture involved, and since it appears in a form which is characteristic only of this culture, the writer designates it as the Indus Valley bull. Certain of its lesser attributes, however, appear in Sumer. A bull with the neck-rings and the saddle-cloth design, but showing both horns, is depicted on a sealing of the Akkad period. This bull is the Bull of Heaven, symbolising the destructive power of the sun. He lies before the goddess Inanna, for whom he was created by her father, Anu, to destroy Gilgamesh and Enkidu. She holds one of his horns (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, XXII, 9). In nearly every representation on the seals found at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, the bull faces a double-tiered stand. Marshall interprets this as being an incense-burner, with the fire in the lower tier, and the incense in the upper, the whole symbolising the sacredness of the animal (Marshall, op. cit., I, p.69). Mackay thinks that the stand may have held a bird (Mackay, Mohenjo-daro, II, P. 384). Dikshit calls the stand "the conventionalised tree, sur- rounded by a stand of basket-work", and believes that the bull and the stand were both ceremonial objects connected with the worship of the principal god of the Indus Valley region, who cannot be known until the script is deciphered (Dikshit, op. cit., p. 44). Vats agrees with Marshall that the stand is an incense-burner, but considers that it ante-dates the buli, and was worshipped before he was, basing this opinion on the early miniature seals of Flarappa, where the stand appears alone, and in one instance is being carried in a proces- sion ( Vats, Excavations, p. 3 22).</page><page sequence="41">THIRTY-THREE The writer agrees with Marshall as to the sacredness of the bull, but not with his inter- pretation of the stand as an incense-burner. The tiers are apparently-in some cases unmistakably-made of basket-work. Since no object resembling the stand has been found in either site, this suggests that the original stand was made of perishable materials; it there- fore could not have held fire. The writer also agrees with Dikshit as to the "conventional tree", but can see no reason to postulate an unknown "principal god", since all the evidence points to the bull as the dominant deity. As to Vats's theory that because the stand appears without the bull on the earliest Harappa seals it was worshipped previously to the bull, this was not necessarily the case, since the symbol of a divinity is not infrequently depicted long before the image of the divinity is represented. In Sumer poles with streamers symbolis- ed the goddess Inanna in the Uruk period; in India the empty throne and the footprints symbolised the Buddha long before his image was made. The double-tiered stand, in the writer's opinion, was probably derived from a tree, conventionalised into a post, adorned with woven leaves and a basket, which sometimes apparently contains fruit, and symbolising the fertility-fecundity power of the bull as the sun. It might also have represented or included offerings. That the stand is merely an attribute of the bull is indicated by the fact that when it appears alone on the early seals it is tall; taller than any of its worshippers who carry it in the procession; but when it is placed before the Bull-deity it becomes smaller and less important. In Harappa the bull appears in a connection which does not exist in Mohenjo-daro. At both sites secular pottery, usually decorated with geometric or flowered patterns, is found. Only at Harappa is there grave-pottery with religious implications. It is significant that animal-forms appear on this grave-pottery, showing a belief in the association of animals with the after-life. On these urns bulls appear beside the souls of the dead (Vats, op. cit., P1. LXII, a, i b). The bulls are much stylised, and exaggeratedly slender, but their horns are those of the Indus Valley Bull. They stand one on either side of a figure representing the soul of the dead, who holds them with ropes. Vats says that the Bulls are escorting the soul to the "Abode of Bliss" and that the goat which is present is a "pathfinder". It might be called an Indus Valley Anubis. The ropes are to bind the soul to the Bulls while crossing the river which must be traversed before reaching heaven; the river flows around the bases of the urns; the feet of the soul and the hoofs of the Bulls are hidden by the waters (P1. V). On some of the grave-urns there are flying peacocks carrying souls to heaven. The souls are beaked, and are in process of becoming birds (PI. V and Vats, op. Cit., P1. LXII, i, a, b; 2; 13; PI. LXIX, 18, 2). This transformation is referred to in a passage from the Baudhayama Dharmasutra, which Vats quotes: "-the birds at the offerings of the dead should receive lumps of food just like the Fathers, on the ground that in the form of birds the Fathers go about" (Vats, Op. Cit., p. 217, n. I ). 5</page><page sequence="42">THIRTY-FOUR A seal-impression found at Mohenjo-daro is a link with later India (Mackay, op. cit., II, PI. C, F; Marshall, I, p. 52). Here a horned three-faced god, seated in the Yoga posture, has been identified by Marshall as a proto-Siva image of the deity in his aspect of Lord of the Animals. On his right are an elephant and a tiger; on his left a rhinoceros and a water-buffalo; two ibexes are beneath his throne. The horns of the god resemble those of the short-horned Bulls on the seals and amulets, though his are somewhat longer. He apparently represents an early anthropomorphic form of the original Bull-god, later separating into Siva and the Bull Nandhi, his mount. The seal perhaps represents the most important deities of the period, the principal place being given to the Bull-god. Besides Siva's connection with the bull, there are also later associations with both the animals on his right, the elephant and the tiger. The elephant-headed god Ganesa is traditionally the son of Siva; Przyluski has the theory that they were originally one and the same god (Getty, quoting Przyluski, Ganes'a, p. 10). In that case, Alice Getty says that Ganesa is to be regarded "as a derivation rather than as an original deity". She suggests that he may be derived from the Bhairava form of Siva, in which aspect the god wears the skin of an elephant and is described as being pot-bellied and having side tusks (Getty, Op. cit., p. 13). This suggests that Siva's Bhairava form was itself originally derived from Siva in elephant-form, so Ganesa should perhaps be considered a reversion rather than a derivation. His obscure origin has given rise to many conflicting tales about his birth; the most convincing tale, in the writer's opinion, is that quoted by Miss Getty, op. cit., p. 8. Various explanations of Ganesa's broken left tusk also exist, all completely unconvincing to the writer. With such an ancient origin, probably some very primitive idea is involved, perhaps of the nature of the belief in the Malay Pen- insula that a ghost- or spirit-elephant can be distinguished from a living one because the spirit-elephant has one tusk which is much smaller than the other (Skeat, Malay Magic, P. 70- '). Siva's association with the tiger is shown in later representations by his wearing a tiger-skin, or being seated on one. The tiger appears without Siva on some enigmatic seals in the Indus Valley. The most striking one is illustrated (Marshall, Op. Cit., I, PI. XI1I, 17). Here a tiger, with horns edged like stiff feathers, is in an attitude of beginning to leap away, and looks back over his shoulder at a figure standing before a tree. This figure has bovine horns, hoofs and tail, and clawed hands. Marshall has interpreted it as being derived from the Sumerian bull-man Enkidu, and Mackay calls it either a hero or a deity. To the writer the figure seems to be clearly that of a woman, with long fleecy hair and well-defined breasts. She bends forward with her left arm raised threateningly; with the right she has just struck or clawed the tiger. On several other seals the tiger is again looking back at a figure seated in a tree. This figure, unlike the almost three-dimensional relief of the bovine-goddess, has no horns, and the technique used is linear; sometimes the figure can hardly be distinguished from the *</page><page sequence="43">THIRTY-FIVE branches (Vats, op. cit., XCIII, 103; Mackay, op. cit., LXXXII, 1, 2, a, b, c; XC, 23, b; 13, a). Marshall and Mackay consider that this scene signifies "a man in a tree being watched by a tiger" (Mackay, Further Excavations, p. 658); an interpretation with which the writer cannot agree. The tiger is not watching; the bovine-goddess and the tree-figures are apparently commanding him to depart, and he is departing, his backward-turned head suggesting reluctance. The explanation of the scene, in the writer's opinion, cannot be secular. The figures in the tree are probably tree-spirits; there may be a fertility connection between them and the cow-goddess with the tiger as protector of the crops. The agricul- tural association with the tiger was very strong; he guarded the crops against deer and wild boar, and he must on no account be killed in a garden or the plants would never bloom again (Thomas, op. cit.). On a few seals the tiger and the tree-spirit appear with other scenes, some of which are obviously not secular (Mackay, op. cit., No.522, XC 13, b; 23,b). Among other animals on the seals, amulets, etc., are the short-horned bull, the Brahmani bull, the rhinoceros, elephant, ibex, crocodile, the buffalo-headed figure at Harappa, the divine cobras, the ram, which is far more frequent at Harappa than at Mohenjo-daro, and the weird composite animals. These, Mackay says, are "a fusion of no less than three, possibly four animals, with the human form, which perhaps represents a deity that was wor- shipped at Mohenjo-daro" (Mackay, Further Excavations, p. 333; Nos. 411,450,521,636, P1. C, A). The composite animal has a human face, horns, an elephant's trunk and tusks; the fore-legs and body are those of the bull; the hindquarters, hind-legs and tail are those of a tiger. The horns vary: in No. 41 they resemble the feathered horns of the tiger with the bovine goddess (Marshall, op. cit., X, I7); in one instance the tail seems to be that of a goat (P1. C, A). It is perhaps significant that the principal animals involved are those associated with the god who is the proto-type of Siva, and with Siva himself later on -the bull, the elephant and the tiger. The predominance of the Indus Valley Bull arouses speculation as to the type of religion practised. The material was found in dwellings. The absence of temples suggests the possi- bility of small household shrines; this might also be implied by the variety of the stands before the Bulls on the seals, of which there are at least six different main types. Small household shrines inevitably suggest ancestral spirits, and it is possible that the Bull as well as being a solar symbol and a fertility symbol, may have been a divine ancestor. This may be the explanation of the bulls which accompany the soul across the river on the Harappa urns, since ancestral spirits sometimes escort the soul. The absence of a priesthood also may imply ancestor-worship, as an organised priesthood is always stronger in religions in which ancestor-worship is not a factor. In Asia, and in Indonesia, ancestor-worship has been most profound and most extensive. Czaplicka has said: "... in the highest god of almost any locality we can trace the ancestor of the people" (Czaplicka, Samoyeds). According to Dikshit, the terra-cotta images of the mother-goddess are the "main visible</page><page sequence="44">THIRTY-SIX link" between the Indus Valley culture and the later culture of the Ganges (Dikshit, op. cit., P. 36). The proto-Siva image, in the writer's opinion, is another link; and the worship of cattle may have originated in the Indus Valley. Their divinity is more than suggested in the Vedas; the bull is Indra, or Surya; cows, representing rays, draw the chariot of the sun; Prthivi, the earth-goddess, has the form of a cow (MacDonell, Vedic Hymns). The soul crossing the river accompanied by the bulls on the Harappa grave-urns has a relic in modern times when a dying Hindu touches the tail of a cow in the belief that it will take him safely across the river of death (Thomas, op. cit.). This is also reminiscent of the Egyptian Bull of Heaven and King Teti. The two earliest concepts have tremendous vitality. They are the foundation of all folk- lore, and all fairy-tales; fairies in the last analysis being derived from the spirits of the dead. The soul is still an integral part of all religions, and animal-worship, though no longer a universal religion, is far from being dead. Not only is it still practised in many places, but like outcroppings of ancient rock in later formations, it rises through the layers of man's experience acquired since the primitive era to appear as survivals, beliefs, superstitions and symbols of those first gods which have been worshipped so much longer than any other deities.</page><page sequence="45">THIRTY-SEVEN CHAPTER TWO SOME REPRESENTATIONS OF ANTTHROPOMORPHISED BIRD-FORMS IN THE PALEOLITHIC ERA THE NEOLITHIC ERA. THE BRONZE AGE IN THE paleolithic paintings, engravings and sculptures in the caves of southern France and Spain, animals predominate overwhelmingly. The principal ones depicted are: two species of the bear, the bison, boar, cattle of several species, deer of various species, elephant, elk, felines, fish, fox, goat, horses of several species, ibex, lion, mammoth, otter, rhinoceros, seal, snake, wolf. Certain small carnivores have been called wolverines; some creatures cannot be identified. There are a few human beings, some composite hybrid forms, and certain signs and symbols. In contrast to the great number of animals represented, the number of birds is very small. Kuhn lists the sites where they are found as being: in Germany, Andernach; in Spain, El Pender, Santander; in France, Arudy, Bruniquel, Fontarnaud, Isturitz, Lourdes, Mas d'Azil, Raymonden, Rey, Le Souci, Teyjat, Croze, Trois Freres, Gargas, (Kuhn, Die Kunst, etc., p. 135). Reinach includes Chancelade, Gourdan, a doubtful bird at Laugerie-Basse, and very doubtful ones at La Madeleine, which Breuil considers to be horses (Reinach, Repertoire, P. 201). In many of these sites, only one or two birds are found. Vayson de Pradennes attributes the majority of the paleolithic representations of birds to the Magdalenian period. He comments on the fact that almost all the birds are aquatic, for which he has no explanation; he cites analogies in the Bronze Age and in Hallstatt. He refers to Dechelette's theory that all the birds of the Bronze Age, etc., are swans, symbolizing the sun; and says that, as Piette discovered numerous bones of heath-cock and young fowl, showing that paleolithic man hunted and ate birds, it is extraordinary that only aquatic birds were represented (De Pradennes, Les Figurations, etc.). There may, in the writer's opinion, be a simple practical explanation for this. Water-birds feed along the shore, or in shallow waters, very often in flocks; they can be observed for long periods at a time, and are therefore easier to study and to depict than other birds.</page><page sequence="46">THIRTY-EIGHT Since the paleolithic representations of birds are so few, it is all the more astonishing to find images of blended man and bird among them; apparently the Bird-man appears as soon as the bird. Both France and Spain have examples of these anthropomorphised figures. According to Saccasyn-della Santa, there are three Aurignacian and four Magdalenian Bird- men in France; two Aurignacian and two Magdalenian images in Spain. This might suggest that the Bird-man originated in France. Of the three Aurignacian examples in France, according to Saccasyn-della Santa, two are in the cavern of David a Cabrerets at Lot. One of these is a wall-painting in red, represent- ing a person in profile with a somewhat bird-like head, rudimentary arms, and lines which might be intended for wings (Saccasyn-della Santa, Les Figures, etc., No. 5). Windels describes this figure as being (cHomme semblant tirer de l'arc)) (Windels, Lascaux, p. 124). The writer also feels some doubt about its being a Bird-man image. The other example is a wall- engraving of a large, amorphous female figure, drooping forward. The head, which is duck- like, with a large bill and a small round eye, looks backward. The one arm shown is disproportionately small and indefinitely winglike (op. cit., No. 6). Lemozi thinks that this figure is looking forward, and that the duck's bill is (da chevelure)), or perhaps the appendage of a mask (Lemozi, La Grotte-temple, P. 134, and P1. 19). The writer considers that it is very doubtful that this image represents an anthropomorphised bird. The third Aurignacian example is a painting in the Lascaux cave. This unmistakable Bird-man will be discussed more fully later. Of the Magdalenian Bird-men in France, one is the central figure of three in a very early engraving on a reindeer-horn from the Grotte du Placard, Charente (Les Figures, etc., No. 8). The head is oval; the execution is very primitive. Capitan, Breuil and Peyrony do not designate this figure as being a Bird-man; in fact, in their caption under the illustration of the reindeer-horn, they place a question-mark after the word "humaines" (Capitan, Breuil et Peyrony, Les Combarelles, Fig. 0oo, i). The writer cannot see any definite evidence for considering this figure to be a Bird-man. The second Magdalenian example is a wall- engraving at Les Combarelles. This figure has a rounded head, with a round eye, and a long and abnormally thick beak. The heavy neck and the indicated shoulder are apparently human. Capitan, Breuil and Peyrony suggest that the face represents a fantastic mask (op. cit.&gt; Fig. 17). They believe that masks existed in the quaternary epoch; Saccasyn-della Santa doubts that they occur as early as this period. At Les Combarelles also is the third Magdalenian example, which is an engraving of a round-parrot-like head, with a large eye and a beak-like nose or beak. There is no body. Capitan, Breuil and Peyrony also consider this head to be anthropomorphic (op. cit., Fig. 65; Les Figures etc., No. io). To the writer the head has no discernible human attributes. The fourth example is an engraving on bone from l'Abri Murat, at Rocamadour. It repre-~</page><page sequence="47">THIRTY-NINE sents two figures, one seated, one standing facing a rock or cliff. The profile of the standing -figure shows an enormous beak (Les Figures, No. II). In Spain at Altamira, one Aurignacian wall-engraving represents the back of a person with a long-beaked bird's head turned in profile, outstretched wings instead of arms, and some sort of covering which ends in a bird's tail, cleft like that of a swallow (Les Figures, etc., No. i). Saccasyn-della Santa questions an Aurignacian dating for this figure. The second example is a partly sketched image on the upper left side of a wall-engraving at Los Casares, Guadalajara (Les Figures, etc., No. 2). In the writer's opinion all the three figures shown might be considered anthropomorphic; they all have round heads with very short beaks; two have somewhat egg-shaped eyes; one is apparently neckless; the necks of the other two are abnormally thin. The very crudely indicated forms are apparently human. This is technically the most primitive representation of the Bird-men. Both Magdalenian examples in Spain are wall-engravings at Altamira. They have a certain similarity; one is an entire male figure, with a bird's head, long pointed beak, round eye, and upraised arms. To the writer the body and feet suggest those of a bear (Les Figures, etc., No. 12). The second instance is a half-figure engraved on the shoulder of a painted boar. The bird-head is also round, with a long pointed beak, which is incomplete, but may originally have been as long as the beak on the preceding figure. The human hands are upraised in a prayerful attitude; the body is clumsily indicated, but may be intended to be human (op. Wit., No. 13). As to the original significance of these bird-headed people, Saccasyn-della Santa does not agree with the theory that they represent masked human beings; she thinks that the existence of masks in the quaternary epoch is not proved. Moreover, some figures have heads which do not represent any species of animal. She thinks it more probable that these heads represent "a certain relation", which existed in the artist's mind, between man and animals. The writer agrees with her so far, but considers that the "relation" was a religious one, which is not her opinion, judging by the four following interpretations which she offers to explain figures grouped with animals, and figures which are partly human and partly animal: i) Totemism: This, in the writer's opinion, did not exist until very much later than the paleolithic era. Her statement, in regard to certain groups which are apparently making offerings to bisons, that the divinisation of an animal is too individualistic to be the art of a very primitive group, seems to the writer to show misunderstanding. This is an era of animal-worship; all animals are divine; any bison is every bison and all bisons. The representation of one animal is the representation of all. 2) Fecundity rites: these would seem unnecessary in a period when herds were incredibly large and the human population very small. Such rites would more probably originate later, when the population was more 'settled and, having increased, had decimated the game in the immediate region to some</page><page sequence="48">FORTY extent. The early paleolithic rites, in the writer's opinion, would more probably have been for the presence, the availability of the animals. It has frequently been noted that the majority of animals depicted are food-animals, which suggests fecundity "magic" in the paintings; however, in the writer's opinion, it should be remembered that these are herd- animals which graze in daylight and are consequently much more familiar than the nocturnal felines, or the solitary bear. 3) Rites of bestiality: Saccasyn-della Santa applies this interpreta- tion to only one Bird-man image, the male Magdalenian figure at Altamira (Les Figures, etc., No. 12). The figure appears on the wall between a horse and a doe. To the author cited, this juxtaposition constitutes union; to the writer it seems that the arrangement is capable of other interpretations. 4) Hunting rites with a sexual character: these, she says, do not apply to any of the Bird-man images. The majority of these four interpretations, in the writer's opinion, are not primitive enough to explain paleolithic psychology; they represent later, more complex states of mind. Among other opinions which Saccasyn-della Santa cites are Deonna's theory that primitive man, having no conception of the difference between the human race and the animals, confused them in his art. KUhn believes that all paleolithic works of art had a magical significance. Luquet thinks that all the hybrid figures were sorcerers, or perhaps divinities. In the writer's opinion, all the paleolithic images had a religious significance; the hybrid figures, combining the human and the divine, might be described as paleolithic priests. It is one of these priests whom we meet in the Lascaux cave, the most definite Bird-man image so far discovered (Windels, Lascaux, pp. 56, 57). The scene is painted in black on the wall of a deep pit which is at a considerable distance from the entrance of the cave. On the right stands a bison, wounded by a spear, its entrails falling from its body. The spear has been thrown by someone "off-stage"; the bison looks back over its shoulder in the direction of the invisible hunter. Lying on the ground, before the animal, is the nude figure of a man with a bird's head and long beak, a rectangular elongated body, outstretched arms ending in hands with four disproportionately thick fingers, and thin straight legs. A throwing stick lies by his feet. In the foreground is a pole with a small compact bird on the top. Beyond the recumbent Bird-man an incomplete rhinoceros is apparently walking away (Pl. I). Windels thinks that the bison has been wounded by the man's spear or by the horn of the rhinoceros. He asks if the scene is painted in memory of a great chief killed in hunting the rhinoceros or the bison; he mentions the bird-on-the-pole, the four-fingered hands of the man, his bird-head, with the beak a "replique exacte" of the beak of the bird-on-the- pole (Windels, op. Cit., p. 63). The writer cannot agree with Windels here: the man's beak is long and straight; the bird's is definitely curved; two different species are suggested. Saccasyn-della Santa asks why the hunter should wear a bird-mask, and suggests that the.</page><page sequence="49">FORTY-ONE bird-on-the-pole brings up the problem of quaternary totemism (op. cit., P. 38). After consideration, the writer has reached the conclusion that the scene actually consists of the bison, the Bird-man and the bird-on-the-pole, and that the unfinished rhinoceros has no connection with this group. In the first place it is walking in the opposite direction; in the second, it is executed in a different technique. The backgrounds, it is true. are obviously dissimilar, but that alone cannot account for the differences. The outlines of the rhinoceros are smudged and blurred, like those of the majority of the animals in the cave above. Though it has not the animated action which is characteristic of the Lascaux animals, its ponderous stride is admirably suggested. On the other hand the Bird-man scene is static; dry and stiff in technique; the outlines are definite and heavy; and the scene as a whole has a summary and purposeful quality which is not found in any other group in the cave. Stylistically, it is obviously the work of one hand. The writer has been unable to find any other instance where the fore-feet are painted in the manner in which the bison's are depicted. The scene is, in the writer's opinion, a completed one; the unfinished rhinoceros is the beginning of a separate painting which was never achieved. As to the significance of the scene, the writer agrees with Windel's suggestion that it is a commemorative scene in honour of the slain Bird-man. Saccasyn-della Santa's theory as to the bird on the pole being totemic, the writer cannot endorse, believing that the bird on the pole long ante-dates totemism. This symbol, the pole with the bird, is associated with death in the ceremonies of several primitive peoples at the present time. Mallery illustrates certain pictographs of the Alaskan Indians; one shows a man beside a house, with a bird-on-a-pole opposite to him. This is called a "shaman stick", and represents a good spirit. It is erected in memory of a departed friend (Mallery, Pictographs, etc., Fig. 122). Another pictograph shows a man beside a headless man who holds a spear; beyond him is a pole with a bird on the basket-shaped top. The meaning is that the man has killed the headless man-a person without a head signifying a dead person, even when, as in this case, he is standing upright -and in remorse has erected the pole which means a good spirit (op. cit., Fig. 11 2). Fig. 53 represents a village, and Fig. 55 a grave, each marked with the bird on the pole to denote that good spirits are protecting the souls of those who have recently died. In various places in the Pacific the bird-on-the-pole is associated with death The Morioris of the Chatham Islands, southeast of New Zealand, have been isolated from other peoples so long that they have acquired a characteristic form of skull, and have developed a language which differs from that of other Polynesians. Evidence shows that the bird-cult was formerly of great importance. The procedure with the bird-on-the-pole is as follows: when a man feels death approaching, he carves a bird, or sometimes a fish, on top of a long stick made of the heart of hake-hake wood, and lights a brushwood fire in a certain place. Where the 6</page><page sequence="50">FORTY-TWO fire dies out, he drives in the pole, and this marks the place of his grave. In the western Pacific, in general, the frigate-bird and the bonito are connected with death. A wooden bird and a stone fish were found on the summit of the great tomb of Oberrea in Tahiti (Skinner, Morioris, etc., P. 126). The human figure without a head also appears among the Morioris. Skinner states that headless figures occur all through the Pacific islands; in Hawaii, Easter Island, the Cook, Tonga, Fiji, Solomon Islands, and on the north coast of New Guinea (Skinner, op. cit., p. 68). He does not say whether or not they represent the dead. This is the case, however, with some Indians of the American northwest, the Ojibwas (Mallery, op. cit., P. 197). It is curious to note that headless figures occur in the cavern of David a Cabrerets, in a group together with a recumbent man, apparently dead, and the drooping female figure (Les Figures, etc., No. 6). On the island of Nias, west of Sumatra, the heads of dead chiefs are put in coffers ornamented with birds, or lizards, or made in the form of the rhinoceros-bird. This bird is so auspicious that images of it are buried under houses to ward off evil. The coffer is placed at the foot of a tall column carved to represent bamboo - denoting an early origin- and surmounted by a bird. Sometimes the skull is placed on top of the column under a cover which is shaped like a bird. One of the chief's souls remains near the column; the other goes to the spirit-world (Schnitger, Les monuments, etc.). Another instance occurs in Mongolia, where a stone bas-relief was found near the grave of a chief of the Tu Kiu, a Turkish tribe. The date is the 7th or early 8th century A. D. On the stone slab is carved the figure of a seated man, with a woman wearing a high pointed hood-like cap and holding a cup on either side of him. In the background above the head of the woman on the spectator's right, is a bird on a pole, facing the central figure. (Salmony, Notes on a Kamennaya Baba). Rostovtzeff illustrates an ivory figurine found at Ephesos. It is apparently that of a priestess holding a jar and a dish. On her head is a long pole sur- mounted by a bird (Orient and Greece, I, P1. LVIII, 3). In some cases the bird is symbolised by feathers. On Easter Island in former times an annual festival was held on the Ahu (the platform tomb) of the king. The Tangata Rongo- rongo, learned bards who understood the ancient symbols, assembled there and chanted the sacred songs. They and the king wore feather head-dresses, and the guests brought sticks with clusters of feathers at the top (Metraux, Ethnology, p. 390). The sticks topped by feathers used by the Zuli Indians are prayers. The priests set them out before every ceremony for the dead. They are placed in shrines, as they are also the most important form of offerings (Kroeber, Zuffi). The pole without the bird is also associated with death. When the Ainus decide to hold a bear-sacrifice, the ceremony is referred to in the invitations as "sending the god away." After the bear is killed, it is worshipped, and prayed to, and offerings for it to take to its *</page><page sequence="51">FORTY-THREE parents are made. The skull is then put on the top of a pole, which is called "the pole for sending away" (Batchelor, Ainus). The pole then must possess a divine quality, since it enables the god's spirit to return to its ancestors. In ancient Hawaii the priests were buried with piles of stones on their graves, which were surrounded by a circle of tall poles (Williamson, Polynesia). Sacrificial posts are described as gods in certain hymns of the Rig-vedas (MacDonell, Vedic Religion). These instances indicate that the pole or post possessed a sacred meaning at a very early period, probably at a pre-image period. It may be called a proto-image of divinity, and it continued to be associated with the spirit-world for many centuries. In the scene at Lascaux the bird-on-the-pole may therefore represent both the Bird-god and the paleolithic Bird-priest, who impersonated him. The four-fingered hands denote divinity, probably suggesting the claws of the bird-origin. Nudity also denotes a divinity or a priest; most paleolithic figures are nude, and this is also true in the neolithic period, where nude figures are depicted in the rock-carvings by the White Sea, in northern Russia. It may be noted that on Sumerian seals the priest is always nude. The wounded bison, in the writer's opinion, represents a prayer. Since the animal is not dead, and since no hunter is depicted, the painting is a prayer that the bison which killed the Bird-priest may be slain. It may be noticed that the prayer is not merely for the killing of the animal, but for a lingering, agonising death. Since the bird, or the symbolic feathers on the pole, is in all these cases associated with an actual burial, it would be interesting to discover whether there are any traces of a grave in the pit at Lascaux. Windels points out that the throwing-stick is exactly the type of those found in the ruins of Tenochitlan, Mexico (op. cit., p. 67). The particularly inacessible place in which the Bird-priest scene is found may have been selected as being especially sacred; or perhaps chosen to guard the secret that a priest could be killed like an ordinary person. Saccasyn della Santa places the paintings at Lascaux in the Aurignacian period; Windels, however, says that they fit as well into the Magdalenian cycle as established by Breuil as into the Aurignacian cycle. Alternative datings suggested for Lascaux, based on the types of animals shown, have been a warm period during the Aurignacian era; or the warm period at the close of the Magdalenian. For the Bird-man scene the second dating would be, in the writer's opinion, the correct one. This composition, expressing a definite idea for which all the parts are necessary for the whole concept, is the product of a relatively complex state of mind. The writer is inclined to think that all the ritual scenes belong to the Magdalenian period. Of Saccasyn della Santa's three Aurignacian Bird-men in France, the writer considers</page><page sequence="52">FORTY-FOUR that two are doubtfully Bird-men, and that one is Magdalenian. Of the four Magdalenian examples, the writer finds the figure from the Grotte du Placard doubtful (Les Figures, etc., No. 8); the parrot-like head at Les Combarelles seems to have no human traits, but, since no birds appear there, it is probably anthropomorphic (Les Combarelles, Fig. 65). This leaves, in the writer's opinion, four Magdalenian examples in France. Of the four Bird-men in Spain, three are at Altamira, which suggests that this cave may have been the place where the blended image originally appeared. On the other hand, the ritual scene at Lascaux indicates a long previous development of the bird-cult, which may have arisen independently in both places. It was quite logical that primitive man should associate divine powers with features and attributes which the animals possessed, and which he did not have. The head was always the most important supernatural part; all the paleolithic Bird-men are bird-headed, though they may have no other bird-attributes. Only one has wings, though these ultimately outlast the head as symbols of divinity. The head symbolises the entire animal and means identity with the god; this is also the original meaning of the mask; the priest was not disguised, but temporarily non-existent while he impersonated the god. The defensive weapons of the horned animals were divine and apotropaic; horns and antlers appear on the heads of paleolithic human figures, and are worn by gods, priests and kings throughout history. The skin was divine, and like any part, represented the entire divine animal. Traces of animal- skin garments can be discerned on some prehistoric figurines. Many centuries later the skins of animal-gods hung on sacred poles may have originated the animal-standards of Egypt; the Egyptian priests wore leopard-skins; Maya priests the skins of jaguars. The skin was associated with prophecy; the priestesses of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus slept on animal-skins in order to acquire foreknowledge (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 92). From a late instance in Norway it might be inferred that the priest or priestess originally slept beside the actual animal. In ancient Norway it was considered natural to dream; if a man did not dream he was "draumstoli", dreamstolen. King Halfdan, being worried as he never dreamed, consulted Thorleif the Wise, who replied that when he wanted knowledge of the future he always slept in a pig-sty, where he was sure to have visions. King Halfdan followed this procedure with complete success (Du Chaillu, quoting Halfdan the Black, Viking Age I, p. 463). Perhaps it was not only because they were not defensive weapons, and apparently of no utilitarian value, but also because man was almost the only animal without one, that tails seem to have been considered to possess particularly supernatural powers. ((Les Figures, etc.)) illustrates several paleolithic human figures wearing tails. No. X is the Altamira Bird- man; Nos. 28, 29, 175, 250 show figures with animals' tails. Dr. Hibben, discussing the ske- letons of the great prehistoric bison found in the western United States, a species which became extinct ten thousand years ago, says that the tail-bones of the bison were almost</page><page sequence="53">FORTY-FIVE invariably missing, though most of the bones "were in place as though the animals lay where they had fallen" (Hibben, Lost Americans, p. 3 7), indicating that the tails had been removed with the hides, probably to be used for ceremonial purposes. In a recent article, Dr. Salmony has shown that a paleolithic rod or wand of mammoth ivory, found at Malta in Siberia, represents the tail of an animal. The wand is carved with regular rows of "crescent incisions " which the illustrations of various other paleolithic objects prove to have represented hair or fur. On female figurines the crescents portray the hair; on a "bison-like" animal they form the mane; on a garment they signify fur (Salmony, An Ivory Carving from Malta, Siberia, and its Significance). The wand is both an example of the mental attitude which caused primitive man to see animal-shapes and animal-attributes in what, to the modern eye, are completely unrelated forms, and another proof of the power and importance of the sacred tail. As might be expected, the prehistoric attitude exists in Egypt, and the kings, from the First Dynasty onward, are depicted with bushy tails like those of foxes; tails were also almost always worn by the gods; and priests also appeared with them (Petrie, Art, Egyptian). In early Japan the term "tailed being" was synonymous with "supernatural being". In the chronicle of 720 A. D., leopard-deities are described as "Two with leopards' tails stuck on them" (Nihongi, II, p. 7o). In Japan's earliest book, the Kojiki, it is stated that savage earthly deities dwelt in the mountains and the interior and made travelling perilous; "They with tails obstructed the path". A being with a tail came out of a well, which shone; a tailed deity in the mountains pushed the cliffs apart (Kojiki, pp. 6, 145, 171 ). No description is given, no other supernatural attribute is mentioned. The writer cannot agree with Luquet and other scholars who believe that an aesthetic intention was involved in the paleolithic paintings, engravings and sculptures. The mind of early man was mystic; in the writer's opinion, this is also true of all his creations. Kroeber says that "the closeness of the connection between the symbolism and the religious life of the Indians cannot well be over-estimated by a white man" (Haddon, quoting Kroeber, Primitive Art); and the connection must have been even closer in the case of paleolithic man. Though aesthetic effects may be achieved by a gifted worker, the purpose of the paleolithic priest-artist is always religious. Art had its origin in religion; religion centered in the belief in the soul; art began as the image of the soul, the two being mystically identical. The duplicative character of all the arts, the imagery of the dance, which is proto- drama, are based on this religious conviction of the mystic identity between a concept or object and its image. The image enhances the original, explains it, extends it in time and space; it has a power which the original form has not. The universal interest in the image throughout human history may be largely due, sub-consciously, to this prehistoric concept that the soul-image has more actual reality than the temporary being or object depicted.</page><page sequence="54">FORTY-SIX The arts were religious symbols very long before they were considered to be aesthetic. Karsten, discussing primitive tribes in South America, says that he did not find a single case of "decorative" painting among tribes which were untouched by European influence (Karsten, Body-painting and Tattooing). The European is the great seculariser; it is due to him that the aesthetic attitude has become materialistic, and that the term "art" today has acquired a completely secular meaning, which separates it from its origin. In the paleolithic era the divorce between religion and art had not taken place. Until very much later, they were one and the same; paleolithic art, therefore, in the writer's opinion, should be interpreted only as symbols of paleolithic religion. THE NEOLITHIC ERA The conditions of the Aurignacian and the Magdalenian periods in France and Spain, when there were very few representations of birds, and yet Bird-man forms appear, are reversed in the neolithic era, when the number of bird-images increases enormously, and among them there are no Bird-men. The paintings and carvings of this era denote an entirely different state of mind from that which produced paleolithic religious art. Breuil and Burkitt think that the paintings in Spain may have been done by people from North Africa, where work very similar to that in the cave of Las Figuras has been found; they point out that the best paintings in Spain are those near the coast; those in the mountains of the interior are less well executed (Breuil and Burkitt, Rock-paintings, etc., p. 88). Santa Olalla, on the other hand, emphatically denies that there is a cultural split in Spain; he considers that the neolithic people were paleolithic hunters in process of becoming herdsmen; and maintains that the style of the paintings originated in Spain, was carried to North Africa, and has remained in the style of the Bushman paintings (Santa Olalla, Neues, etc.). Owing to recent dicoveries, the consensus of present opinion is in favor of Santa Olalla's theory. The analogies are certainly with Africa, and in spite of the impossibility of dating them in relation to the neolithic paintings in Spain, probably the Bushman paintings should be mentioned here, since, whatever the time element, they represent a neolithic state of culture. Here there are anthropomorphised figures, some of which have birds' heads. Stow and Bleek say that these bird- or animal-heads may be masks or disguises for use in stalking game, or worn in certain ceremonies, or they may represent animal-metamorphoses (Stow and Bleek, Rock-paintings, etc., Introduc., p. X). All the four bird-headed people whom they illustrate are women; three with vulture-heads, P1. 6; and a woman with a bird's head, long beak, and crest, and an indicated tail, P1. 40. In view of the fact that in Egypt the vulture was the</page><page sequence="55">FORTY-SEVEN emblem of maternity from an early period, there may be a connection between this ancient tradition and the vulture-women of the Bushmen. No Bird-men appear at Badari; none are illustrated among the many birds of Hadschra Miktuba (Frobenius and Obermaier). Nor are they to be found in neolithic carvings of Morocco, Algiers, Tunisia and the Sahara (Armand Ruhlmann), nor among those of Lower Nubia (Dunbar, Rock-pictures of Lower Nubia). There are, however, apparently several bird-headed figures on the rock-carvings of southern Upper Egypt; a group of running people with beaked heads appears among carvings done by the autochthonous mountain-dwelling people; and two more definitely bird-headed figures are found on rocks carved by the earliest hunters. One figure has a crest or head- dress of five long points; the head of the second figure, with its snarling open beak, suggests that of a bird of prey. A form of the cross found here also occurs in Europe and Asia. (Winkler, Rock-drawings, etc., Vol. II, Pls. XXIV, 2; and LV, 2). One possible exception to the general European absence of Bird-men may be at Alpera, in Spain, where there is a curious human figure with narrow wings, no arms, and a long- beaked head, which is surmounted by two rather large ears (Reinach, Repertoire, p. 5, lower right). In their article on Alpera, Breuil and Cabri do not refer to this figure (L 'Anthropologie, 9 12); there are no photographs available, therefore it remains only a possible exception. In northern Europe the same dearth of bird-deities continues. Among the deer, elk, reindeer, bears, whales and halibut, of the rock-carvings of northern Scandinavia, only a very few seabirds with long necks appear (Shetelig and Falk, Scandinavian Archaeology). In western Norway the elk and the deer are almost the only animals carved, with a few snakes, and some creatures which may be dogs. The execution is excessively crude; the elk and deer are sometimes headless and are almost invariably facing toward the spectator's right. This repeated position may have some symbolic significance, which might be explicable if the relation of this direction to the points of the compass were stated. The bear does not appear (B0e, Felszeichnungen). The rock-carvings in two sites in northern Russia offer a much greater variety of subject- matter than is found in Scandinavia. One site is at Lake Onega; the other, the White Sea site, is near the village of Vyg-Ostrow, where the river Vyg flows into the sea. The Russian scholar Raudonikas, who explored both places exhaustively, considers that the pottery found at the White Sea is earlier than that of Lake Onega, and that therefore the White Sea rock- carvings are earlier. He places them in the second millenium, B. C. The White Sea style, he maintains, is purely realistic; that of Lake Onega is geometric; the White Sea carvings are concerned with the "magic of the chase and totemism"; Lake Onega shows elements of mythology, and a solar and lunar cult (Raudonikas, Les gravures rupestres, etc.). Zemliakov, in an article in Raudonikas' book, dates the Lake Onega carvings IOOO-5oo B. C. There is, however, in the writer's opinion, reason to think that the Lake Onega carvings</page><page sequence="56">FORTY-EIGHT are earlier than those of the White Sea. Geographically, it is most likely that Lake Onega would be inhabited first; the rest of the evidence is in the rockcarvings themselves: i) The objects depicted at Lake Onega are presented in a detached way, merely as separate entities. The effect is static and reminiscent of the early paleolithic absence of grouping. The White Sea carvings show a typically neolithic profusion and confusion of figures, with an effect of motion. 2) At Lake Onega very few human figures appear. They are far more numerous at the White Sea. 3) Women are depicted at Lake Onega. At the White Sea only men appear, with one possible, though uncertain, exception (Fig. 8i). 4) No bows and arrows appear at Lake Onega. They occur quite frequently at the White Sea. 5) There are no skis at Lake Onega; these appear at the White Sea. 6) A very striking difference is seen between the boats of the two sites. At Lake Onega they suggest primitive, dug-out canoes. The sides are very low; enormous elks' heads with antlers adorn the prows. The sides of the White Sea boats are very much higher; the elk- heads on the prows have dwindled in size and lost their antlers. It is hardly probable that the first boat-builders should have omitted such a characteristic feature as the antlers; it is more likely that they appeared on the original boats and were omitted as time went on. The Lake Onega boats are definitely symbolic in appearance; the White Sea boats are obviously principally utilitarian. 7) No bears appear at Lake Onega, the bear being ignored, apparently, in early times. At the White Sea there are a few representations of the bear. 8) The number of birds at Lake Onega is far greater than that at the White Sea. This may indicate a difference in cult. The best carvings at Lake Onega are very much better technically than any at the White Sea. The two sites show many differences, also certain similarities. Animal-headed figures, sometimes tailed as well, appear in both places. As the carving is very rough and crude, it is often impossible to identify the animal. These figures are nude, and are probably priests. Laymen, such as the people in the boats at Lake Onega, are clothed. It cannot be said definitely that any of the figures have birds' heads, but one image particularly seems to be bird-headed (PI. 13, Fig. 1 14), and two others seem to be beaked (PI. 13, 115, I1i6). Wilke illustrates a bone figure with two birds' heads from Lake Ladoga, in the region of Lake Onega, but states that he has concluded, after examination, that the artist had intended to depict human heads, although he actually made birds' heads (Wilke, Kulturbeziehungen, etc., pp. 2 10-1I1, Fig. 199). The neolithic era in Europe offers nothing certain in the way of Bird-men forms. There</page><page sequence="57">FORTY-NINE are only vague possibilities. Except for these, it seems as though the Bird-priest had departed with the Magdalenians. According to Nakaya, an example of a neolithic bird-headed image is found in Japan. In the oldest group of the earliest style, the Jomonshiki style, there are terracotta figurines with the faces of owls. The eyes are large, round staring, and are treated somewhat in the manner of the owls' eyes on early Chinese bronzes; there is no beak, and the rest of the face is humanised. In the writer's opinion the face, with its very round eyes and ears, has a cat-like appearance. The figure is covered with drawings of lines. Nakaya considers these figurines to be eneolithic. They are found only in northern Japan, along the Tonegawa River, at the edge of the Bay of Kasumigawa (Nakaya, Introduction a l'etude, PL. 3, Fig. 3). Bird-deities are found among neolithic peoples all over the Pacific area. These will be discussed in the following chapter. THE BRONZE AGE After their mysterious absence in the neolithic era, Bird-men forms re-appear in Europe in the Bronze Age. Probably the earliest examples are the figures on two pottery bird- chariots found at Wershetz and at Belgrade. In both cases a bird-headed figure rides in the chariot, but the Belgrade example, which is illustrated on PI. VI, differs from the Wershetz chariot in several particulars. It has three wheels instead of two, the third wheel being in front of the others between the protomes of two ducks which are also the shafts of the chariot. A smaller duck, executed with great animation, is perched on the front of the chariot, and behind it stands the bird-headed figure. This deity, clad in a tight-fitting upper garment and a bell-shaped skirt, is very much simplified and stylised. The rounded head with its short beak suggests a dove; the arms and spread-out hands are curiously flattened; the eyes are represented by a circle enclosing a dot, and this dotted circle also appears as a decorative element on the garment, the chariot and the wheels. These all have four spokes, and are decorated by having incised lines along the rim and on the spokes. These bird-figures have been usually considered to be goddesses, but Otto says that there are male genitalia inside the bell-shape of the Belgrade figure, and that therefore it may be male, or perhaps a dual figure signifying fertility (Otto, Handbuch der Archaeologie, IV, p. 88). In connection with this it may be noted that the two ducks by the front wheel have parallel lines around their necks, suggesting the white collars on drakes of certain species. According to Otto, these drakes, if such they are, are the earliest examples of the ducks which appear so extensively throughout the Hallstatt period (op. Cit., p. 88). He dates the chariots at 1400 B. C.; scholars at present consider that the date is nearer to Iooo B. C. 7</page><page sequence="58">FIFTY Some images on painted pottery were found at Numancia, in eastern Spain. Taracena- Aguirre illustrates several; one of these is a bird-headed, stocky figure holding two swords (Taracena-Aguirre, Arte Iberico, Fig. 4); another Bird-man, on a fragment, holds a stick in his raised hand (Fig. 5); a third, which has an exceedingly thin waist, is holding what seems to be a branch (Fig. 7). All the heads are round, with very short beaks. They have a certain resemblance to the engraved paleolithic bird-headed figures at Los Casares, Gua- dalajara, which is not far distant. The bird represented might have been the dove. Some symbolic significance is undoubtedly attached to the fact that all three figures hold weapons of defense. At Halland, an article which is probably a pole-top is composed of a bird's head and a man's face (Althin, Studien, etc., No. 3o). It is interesting to compare this object with similar ones based on the same combination on Easter Island. In Halland there is also an example of the bird-on-the-pole (op. cit., No. II 3). Italy, which has so far produced no Bird-deities in either of the preceding eras, is equally devoid of them in this period. The rock-carvings in the Ligurian Alps represent principally oxen and plowing scenes (Burkitt, Rock-carvings, etc.). The most interesting feature is that the carvings are done only on a particular sort of bright red rock, which may indicate that the early inhabitants, like certain other primitive peoples, regarded red as a sacred color. Mallery quotes from Taylor's book on New Zealand, Te Ika a Maui, in which Taylor says that red was the sacred color to the natives there, and closely connected with their religion; the idols, the sacred stages for the dead and for offerings and sacrifices, the graves, the chief's houses and the war-canoes were all painted red. "The way of rendering anything tapu was by making it red" (Mallery, Pictographs, etc., p. 56). Mallery points out that red was anciently associated with divinity and with temporal power; "the gods and images of Egypt and Chaldea were noticeably of that color." Skins dyed red covered the tabernacle of the Israelites (Mallery, op. cit., p. 54). The Pawnee Indians, who, like some of the Omahas, have a bison ancestor, paint the dried skull of a cow-bison red and address it as "Mother" (Thomas, op. cit.). Mackay says that most of the figurines found at Mohenjo-daro are painted red, as are many present-day figurines in India. The color is appropriate for sacred images. Red-painted figures are found at Badari, Cypress, Serbia; and in Babylonia gods and protective demons were colored red. Red was also a fertility color. Mackay considers that the red female figurines of the Indus Valley therefore represent the earth-goddess. (Mackay, Further Excavations, etc., I, p. 259). Burkitt thinks that the carvings in the Ligurian Alps were connected with seasonal pilgrimages to pray for rain. The selection of the bright red rocks for the scenes, which are principally agricultural, suggests that red may have been a fertility color with the Ligurians. The most interesting and varied of the Bronze Age rock-carvings in Europe, so far as *</page><page sequence="59">FIFTY-ONE the writer has discovered, are those at Bohuslan, in Sweden, which is situated on a peninsula in the Cattegat. Among the animals depicted there are the bear (?), birds, a carnivore, crane, cuttlefish, deer, dog (?), fox, horse, musk-ox, ox (domestic), snake, turtle, wolf Animal- worship is shown by the presence of figures with horns and tails, who brandish long spears or axes, and are probably warriors (Du Chaillu, Viking Age II, Figs. 895, 901). Other human figures have animal-heads, which are not always easy to identify; in one instance, which shows three such persons, one head is like that of a bear (op. cit. II, Fig. 905). Three bird- headed figures appear in a group of four holding axes high above their heads (op. cit. II, Fig. 902). An illustration in Althin's book on Skane shows a figure with a bird-like head holding an axe above one of the curious trees with parallel branches ending in hooks found at Bohusldn (Althin, Studien, etc., No. 7). Two winged armless figures have birds' heads; one has two heads (op. cit., No. 29). Another figure has four wings and a bird-like head (op. cit., No. ii o). Two men, holding up very long axes, which are bent or broken at right angles,- have apparently birds' heads (op. cit., Pls. I8, 20). Certain elements at Bohusldn are reminiscent of Lake Onega; many of the boats have very low sides, but some have a double or split prow. Animal-heads appear on some boats; they may be on both prow and stern. The heads may be those of different animals (Du Chaillu, op. cit., Figs. 901, 902, 905). The heads are sometimes stylised into scrolls (Fig. 891). There is an instance where the animal-head at the prow is looking back toward the stern (Fig. 895). Two birds are reminiscent of birds at Lake Onega, and also of the neolithic birds in the Cueva de las Figuras in Spain (Fig. 9og). The distinctive form of the cross which ap- pears in southern Upper Egypt and at Lake Onega is also found at Bohuslan (Althin, op. cit., No. 22). Kuhn illustrates a Bohusldn figure, which is bird-headed and holds an axe. The body is composed of a well-known neolithic symbol -a circle containing a cross (Kuhn, Die vorgeschichtliche Kunst, etc., p. 282). Rock-carvings at Quruq-tagh, in the northern border region of Lop-nor, in Sinkiang, eastern Asia, have no Bird-men, but they suggest some connection with Bohusldn in two instances. The Bohusldn trees with parallel branches ending in hooks, which evidently represent pine trees, also occur at Quruq-tagh. In one case the compositions in both places are similar; a tree at Quruq-tagh is placed beside a low fence-like structure in the same way that a tree at Bohusldn is placed beside a long, low boat (Althin, op. cit., Nos. 5, 7). The cross of Lake Onega and Bohusldn also appears at QOruq-tagh. Another European element is the hand, which is found in the earliest carvings. This paleolithic feature does not, Tall- gren says, occur in Siberian or in Mongolian rock-pictures (Bergman, Archaeological Re- searches, etc., p. 190). The Bird-deity to be described next is associated with a religion of great antiquity, the worship of Mitlira, God of heavenly light, though the example illustrated actually post-dates</page><page sequence="60">FIFTY-TWO the Bronze Age. Mithra was a divinity in both early Iran and India, and while in the latter country his light soon faded, in Iran it shone for centuries, and from there spread to Egypt, North Africa, Spain, Greece, Italy, Germany, Central Europe, southern Gaul, and into the island of Britain as far north as Hadrian's wall. An inscription found at Boghaz-keui shows that Mithra was one of the gods worshipped in Mitanni in the 14th century B. C., from which it has been inferred that there was a colony of Aryans in Mitanni at that time (Jones, Mithraism). The sanctuaries of the religion were always subterranean; crypts, natural caves, or chapels in the cellars of private homes. The largest shrine known is in the Baths of Caracalla; there are also sanctuaries under Santa Maria in Aracceli and San Clemente. The general plan was a fore-court, with a stairway leading down into a long ante-room at the end of which was an apse which always contained a bas-relief of Mithra slaying the bull, a scene which re- presented the very heart of the religion. This scene is always laid in a cave; the basic elements are Mithra; the dying bull whose fertilising powers renew plant-life, therefore sometimes grain grows from his wound, or his tail ends in ears of grain; a scorpion attacks him, and a dog and a serpent drink his blood. Two torch-bearers are usually present, one raising his torch to signify the rising sun, the other holding his downward to denote the setting sun. The raven appears on Mithra's mantle, at the border of the cave, or in the back-ground. Trees and plants may be depicted; and the principal scene may be surrounded by smaller scenes describing the life of Mithra. One of these shows the god being born from a rock; in another he is emerging from a tree-trunk. The Mithraic bas-relief illustrated (PI. VII) was found at Konjeca, in Bosnia. The scene is a ceremonial feast. In the center two figures recline on a couch; their right arms, which are damaged, are raised. Cumont considers that they probably held cups or rhytons. He interprets the figures as being Mithra and the Sun (Cumont, Textes et Monuments relatifs aux Mysteres de Mithra, I, p. 175). Before the couch is a three-legged table on which are four loaves of bread, each one marked with a cross. On one side of the table is a lion, on the other, a bucranium. On the extreme left of the relief is a pillar, next a figure with a raven's head, then a man in Persian costume who is holding an object, which is apparently a drinking-horn. On the right, by the pillar, is a lion-headed man beside a figure which is very badly mutilated. These four standing figures represent different degrees of initiation into the mysteries of the religion. There were seven grades: Raven, Occult, Soldier, Lion, Persian, Messenger of the Sun, Father (Cumont, op. cit., p. 315). The Raven and the Persian are on the left; the Lion and the Soldier, which is the usual interpretation of the mutilated figure, on the right. The influences from Babylonia, Iran, Asia Minor, Greece, etc., on Mithraism cannot be considered here; in any case, they tend to obscure the beginnings of the religion. The</page><page sequence="61">FIFTY-THREE road to origins, in the writer's opinion, is always indicated by those earliest sign-posts, the animal-elements. Of these, the bull, the raven and the lion are undoubtedly the prehistoric elements to be considered, since unlike the other creatures depicted, the dog, scorpion, serpent, they cannot be explained on later grounds. The writer therefore interprets the early history of Mithra as follows: Mithra was originally the bull, worshipped by pre-Iranian Aryans. When stones become gods he is also the rock; later still he becomes also the divine tree; when worship of the heavens begins, he is the heavenly light. He is above, apart from, and yet identical with, his early manifestations, which accompany him throughout his long history in an extraordinary continuity. At the ceremony (P1. VII) the bucranium is un- doubtedly before him as his emblem; the lion crouches before the Sun. As the Aryan deity of heavenly light Mithra is the source of the Iranian Mithra and the Hindu Mitra. There was certainly an association with fertility from the beginning of the bull-worship, which is enhanced when Mithra, who has an inclusive quality, becomes a vegetation-deity, emerging from a tree. Trees have always been particularly divine for Aryan peoples; at Dodona, perhaps the earliest Greek shrine (Frazer, Balder, II, p. 89), Zeus was called "the one in the tree-trunk" (Schrader, Aryan Religion); tree-worship extended through- out the European peninsula. Mithra slaying the bull that the land may be fertile means that the god in his latest aspect sacrifices his earliest aspect to a later vegetation aspect; that is, Mithra sacrifices Mithra to Mithra. The bull and the vegetation aspects merge when grain grows from the. tail and the wound of the dying bull. The theory that Mithra and the bull were, "in a sense, one", was suggested by Loisy, and dismissed by Stuart Jones as "fanciful" (Jones, Mithraism, P. 757, n. 2). To the writer their identity seems certain. The name of the god signifies "friend" in Sanskrit, the only instance known to the writer of a god being designated as friend. This suggests that Mithra lacks the potential enmity of most deities, and this fact, together with the sacrifice for the sake of fertility, places Mithra, in the writer's opinion, among those divinities who are perhaps the only gods who are not potential enemies, the gods who die annually, and are resurrected in the spring. Among these deities, associated with death, renewal of life, and the sun, Mithra is atypical in that he dies in one aspect in the sacrifice, but lives in his most important aspect, and is therefore hardly associated with the death. But Cumont has commented on his sad expression when slaying the bull (op. cit., p. 316), which is because the act is an enforced suicide. From Dumuzi, the original Sumerian deity onward, all these gods are associated with Mother-goddesses; Mithra is connected with Anahita, river-goddess, associated with the Oxus. Moulton thinks that the connection may have come from a Semitic source in pre- historic times (Moulton, Iranians). Mithra is again atypical here; his connection with Anahita is vague and intangible compared with the passionate relationships of the other dei-</page><page sequence="62">FIFTY-FOUR ties and mother-goddesses. Perhaps it may be due to Anahita that water was such an important element in Mithraic rituals; the sanctuaries were always either near springs, or else had water artificially connected with them, and it was extensively used in the purificat- ion and baptismal rites. There is a possibility that the bull may have been associated with water, which was the case in Sumer. A bi-lingual hymn in Sumerian and Semitic says that the bull "makes the field luxuriant", and that "Between his horns is the mouth of the deep" (Sayce, Bull, Semitic). Sayce also refers to the great basin in Solomon's temple called "the sea" which rested on the images of twelve oxen (I Kings, 7, 20). The association of Anahita with Mithra, though nebulous, is of long duration; images of the mother-goddess are found in the sanctuaries in Europe; there is a crude image even in the third-century shrine found at Carrowburgh, on Hadrian's wall, in 1949 (Illustrated London News, March24th 1951, P. 455). An association between the Minotaur and a mother-goddess is suggested by Sayce, based on the fact that the Minotaur is called "Asterius ", which indicates a connection with the Phoe- nician goddess, Ashtoreth (Sayce, op. cit.). Here again a bull is slain in a subterranean cavern. The dying and deathless gods seem to have inspired a particular quality of love and devotion in their followers. Mithra 's worshippers, principally from the official and military classes, were fervent, though the rites of initiation into the religion were rigorously severe, and the practice demanded high courage. Frazer mentions "the immense popularity" of Mithraism, which had "aspirations after moral purity and a hope of immortality" (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. 302). Cumont says that "no other religion ever offered to members such op- portunity for prayer and motives for veneration" (op. cit., English transl., p. i49). The other two early animal-elements are the Raven-headed and the Lion-headed figures. The writer entirely agrees with Cumont that these two represent a pre-historic origin; they belong to the era of animal-gods. The ritualistic actions of these masked initiates as described by a fourth-century Christian writer show that the worshippers were seeking to achieve mystic identity with the gods: ((Les uns battent des ailes comme les oiseaux, imitant la voix du corbeau, les autres rugissent a la fa~on des lions)) (Cumont, op. cit., I, p. 315). Concerning the Lion it need only be said that he signified Eternal Time; the Raven is the more important figure for this study. He appears in two forms; as the Raven-headed figure at the ceremonial feast, and as a bird on the bas-reliefs where Mithra slays the bull. Cumont points out that the Raven always looks at Mithra, who turns away from the bull, sometimes taking twisted and difficult positions, in order to look at the Raven (op. cit., P. 192). His convincing inter- pretation is that the Raven here is the Messenger of the Sun who brings the order to kill the bull, which Mithra sorrowfully obeys. The Raven therefore must represent two grades of initiation, the first, as the Raven, and the sixth, as the Raven, Messenger of the Sun. Cumont states that the first three grades of initiation were the lowest, and that only the four higher grades, beginning with the Lion, were true "Participants" of the religion. But</page><page sequence="63">FIFTY-FIVE the Raven, as the Sun's messenger, has the highest grade next to the supreme one of the Father. He therefore seems to begin and to complete the cycle of initiation. There is a possibility, it seems to the writer, that all the grades may be represented in the scene on PL. VII. The Occult grade, of which no visible form has been found, were probably, Cumont says, veiled, and hidden from the others. If the Raven represents two grades, then all the grades might be present, the Father being represented by the Sun, the source of the heavenly light which is Mithra. Cumont refers to the unexplained appearance of the eagle on some of the bas-reliefs, which suggests to the writer the possibility that the eagle, so frequently associated with sky- gods, may have been the original bird, which in later times became confused with the Raven, which was the messenger of Ahura Mazda. To the two pre-historic animal-figures the other personages were added later, the number seven representing the sun, moon, and five planets (Cumont, Op. Cit., p. 3 1 6). The dog, which drinks the blood of the dying bull, is probably an element from Zoroastrianism, in which the dog was reverenced (Sayce, Median Religion). The serpent and the scorpion are usually interpreted as being the evil creatures of Ahriman, the enemy of Ahura Mazda. Mithra, the "Unconquered Sun", was lord of the equinoxes (Carnoy, Zoroastrianism). His birthday, Dezember 25th, the winter solstice, was taken over by the Christians in the 4th century and arbitrarily made the birthday of Christ, the reason being, as one writer frankly states, that the Christians took part in the Mithraic ceremony, and "had a leaning to this festival" (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. 315). Perhaps there were other borrowings; the Mithraic initiation was called the Sacrament; there was a baptismal ceremony, an imago resurrectionis; and a Communion with bread and water, which is very probably the rite shown on the bas-relief illustrated on P1. VII. Mithraism is a microcosm of the history of religion. There are the prehistoric elements; animal-worship, with the Bull, and the ritual dancers striving to achieve mystic identity with the Raven- and Lion-gods; stone-worship, with Mithra's birth from the rock, "Petra Genetrix "; his identity with the tree, and the consequent vegetation-sacrifice; his association with water, when he shoots the arrow into a rock and a stream gushes forth; the adoration of the heavens, when Mithra becomes the light which precedes the rising sun and remains after the sun has set. From this beginning there develops a religion of great spirituality and austerity; the initiates must endure "water and fire, frost, hunger, thirst, and journeyings." Mithra is the "Redeemer"; his aid is sought in "this world of the body, and the world of the spirit." He "brings men together"; he is "the lord of wide pastures"; he "watches the tillers of the soil." He is the God of Battles; the "guardian of truth and good faith"; his companions are Obedience and Justice. He assists the soul, which is originally a divine spark from Heaven, to return to Paradise. He is the "myriad eyed" who "foremost attains</page><page sequence="64">FIFTY-SIX the gold-decked fair summits." To him belongs the divine Effulgence, "the Glory". He is reverenced by another great Deity as being "as worthy of prayer as myself, Ahura Mazda." There is even a suggestion of Abstract Concept, in the idea of Time as the First Cause, with the sun as its physical manifestation; and perhaps also in the exaltation of silence; "Put thy right finger on thy mouth, and say Silence! Silence! Silence! Symbol of the living imperishable God!"</page><page sequence="65">FIFTY-SEVEN CHAPTER THREE THE WIDESPREAD BELIEF IN A CONNECTION BETWEEN BIRDS AND THE SPIRIT-WORLD AN EARLY conception of the after-life was that the soul continued to live underground. This idea persists, remaining as an alternative with other conceptions, and apparently finally divides the soul into two souls, one remaining in or near the grave, one going to the Spirit- world; or there may be a plurality of souls, one of which remains underground. It seems probable that the birds first drew primitive man's eyes away from his immediate sur- roundings, and ultimately were the cause of the belief that the soul went to the heavens. The mysterious ability of the birds to detach themselves from the earth, their capacity for vanishing into a realm where not even the most powerful creature could follow, inevitably aroused the belief that they were divine beings of the other-world. It is possible that their singing had an influence. Many primitive races pay great attention to the singing of the birds, and songs are an integral part of primitive ceremonies, sometimes the most im- portant part. Elkin, speaking of the northeastern Australians, says that their sacred places, abodes of totem-spirits, are called "Dreamings"; and the Spirit-world is "Eternal Dream- time", which is symbolised by ritual dances and songs. When a man is being painted and decorated to impersonate a sacred character, the other men sing of the life of that character. The design is "sung on to his skin," and he becomes transformed into the actual hero; he becomes "Dreaming". The ritual objects are, Elkin says, the "expressions" of the ritual song. They are accompanied by songs while they are being made, and when they are brought out after having been laid away. They are less important than the songs; "Moreover, they are of no value without the associated chants" (Elkin, and R. and C. Berndt, Art in Arnhem Land, pp. 3, 6, 9, 1o, 11). It may be inferred from this that the songs are of greater antiquity than the ritual objects. This is the case with the eastern Eskimo and the Bushmen who have far more songs and tales than manufactured objects (Boas, Primitive Art, P. 299). The dis-</page><page sequence="66">FIFTY-EIGHT crepancy between the poetic imagination of the conception of the "Dreamings" and the songs, and the crudity of some of the ritual objects, is very marked, and also occurs in other primitive races. Perhaps it was the flight of the bird into the unseen distance that caused it to be parti- cularly associated with the departure of the soul from life. Later on the birds are associated with the natural forces; with agriculture; with war; in one instance, which the writer con- siders doubtful, with sex. They were used as sacrificial offerings; they were almost invariably holy and auspicious, but, as always, their unknown powers make them potential enemies, and some instances of ill-omened or malevolent birds appear. From the great amount of material on the subject, the writer will give a few instances to indicate the range of beliefs concerning the divine birds. The most important aspect of the bird is its identity with the soul, together with the various relations which arise from that original identity. The bird may be the actual divine ancestor, or it may be the ancestral soul, or the abode of the ancestral soul. The soul of the living may become a bird after death; or it may enter a bird; or it may be escorted to the Spirit-world by a bird. Birds may bring the souls, or they may actually be the souls of new-born children. The distinction between the bird being the soul, and being the abode of the soul, is of course the first sign of slipping away from the ego-less primeval sense of identity with the animal or bird. The bird also may be a spirit guarding and assisting men in various undertakings, or it may be the tutelary spirit of one individual. The Sumerian bird-soul, the Egyptian white ibis-soul, and human-headed bird-soul, the Harappan soul carried by a bird and becoming a bird, have been mentioned. Another instance of the bird-and-soul identity in Egypt is that of the god Osiris, on whose tomb at Diospolis Parva his soul appears as a bird in a tamarisk tree with the legend, "The Soul of Osiris" (Frazer, Adonis, II, p. ii o). White birds and white animals generally are connected with the soul. The Shilluks of the White Nile believe that the souls of their kings become white birds after death (Thomas, op. cit.). In Bohemia the soul departed as a white bird (Frazer, Taboo, p. 34). Yamato-take's soul flew from his tomb in the form of a white plover eight fathoms long (Kojiki, P. 286). An unofficial Moslem belief is that the souls of true believers are green birds and those of unbelievers are black birds (Frazer, Taboo, p. 36, n. 3). Preoccupation with the soul is especially great in Indonesia and Malaya. In the former area, there is a general belief that birds are incarnations of the dead; ancestral souls abide in white hens or in other birds (Kruijt, Indonesians). The spirits of chiefs and ancestors in the Solomon Islands dwell in frigate-birds (Codrington, Melanesians). Pigeons are ancestral souls to some of the tribes on the Pellew Islands (Frazer, Spirits II P. 293). 'Wizards in Melanesia send out their souls in the form of an eagle (Frazer, Taboo, p. 33). In New</page><page sequence="67">FIFTY-NINE Britain beneficent deities with wings live in banyan trees, and though they are not called birds, the various organisations of the people are usually named after birds, and Rivers says that the attitude is totemic (Rivers, New Britain). The winged deities are most probably ancestral spirits which were formerly birds. In central New Ireland the deity who created heaven, earth, and man is called by a term used for "female ancestor", birds, and sacred objects. The totems are usually birds. Intricate carvings exist of birds fighting with snakes which represent evil spirits (Rivers, op. cit.). In Malaya the soul is called the "pingai bird" and is invoked with the same word used for calling chickens, "kur". (Skeat and Blagden, Pagan Races, II, p. i) A Malay, feeling faint, will call, "Hither, hither, bird of my soul" (Frazer, Spirits, I, p. i8 ). The Jakun tribe believe that the souls of all Malays, Chinese and Siamese come from birds. The Semang woman carries the bird which contains the soul of her expected child in a cage of bamboo; she must eat the bird at a certain time in order to provide her child with a soul. The same belief is held by the Kelantan Negritos; they announce that a woman is to have a child by saying, "She has eaten the bird". Certain birds bring the female souls; others the male souls (Skeat and Blagden, op. cit., II, pp. 46). The soul is a bird also in Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes. In Sumatra, after one of the tribe has returned from a dangerous expedition, the Bataks place rice upon his head in order to induce the soul to stay at home. The Minangebauers of Sumatra do not believe officially in a soul-bird, but their poetry and their language show evidences of the belief that the soul departs from life in the form of a bird. The soul is also persuaded by gifts of rice in Java, where, when a mother puts her child on the ground for the first time, she places it near a hencoop and clucks. Borneo, too, induces the soul to remain by means of rice, and the natives murmur, "Cluck, cluck, soul," as though speaking to a fowl. In South Celebes a bridegroom's soul is apt to fly away at the wedding, therefore colored rice is scattered over him to lure the soul to stay. This is done too at other festivals where a person's soul is in danger from evil spirits (Frazer, Taboo, p. 35). In Formosa it was thought wrong to gather food or wood without considering the singing of the birds. The Ania tribe never ate chickens, believing them to be the abode of good spirits (Campbell, Formosa). These were probably ancestral souls. The fact that the Morioris of the Chatham Islands, southeast of New Zealand, call the tree-carvings, which represent their ancestors, "birds", implies that originally the ancestral souls were birds. Skinner says that there is no evidence that they thought the soul became a bird (Skinner, Morioris, p. 7o), but at the ceremonies to Tiki, the Creator and First Man, carved birds are placed on his mound in parallel rows; and since the Morioris have birds painted on cliffs, birds painted on house-fronts, bird-shaped weapons, birds carved on feather- decorated boats, and the bird-on-the-pole connected with burial, it may be inferred that</page><page sequence="68">SIXTY in former times the bird-cult was of importance and in all probability was associated with the ancestral spirits. In Adelaide, Australia, an instance reminiscent of New Britain occurs; the soul lives in a tree during the day and comes down at night to eat caterpillars, frogs, etc. (Thomas, Australia). The bird-origin is obvious. The natives of Cape Bedford in Queensland believe that children are created in the distant west by spirits with long hair. On their journeys to the earth the girls are changed into plovers and the boys into snakes (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. Io2). Complete identity with the soul-bird in life as well as in death exists among the Bororos of Brazil, who not only believe that their souls become red macaws after death but also that they themselves are identical with the birds during life (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 208). Some Brazilian tribes tattoo their faces to resemble the birds into which their souls will pass at death (Thomas, Animals). The Isannas and Zaparo of Brazil believe that the souls of the brave will become birds of beautiful plumage (Mac Culloch, State of the Dead). The Tucanos, a sub-stock of the oldest Brazilian tribe, the Tapuyas, call themselves by the name of the Toucan, their totem (Spence, Brazil), which suggests a toucan-ancestor. On the lower Amazon the soul-birds are the macaw, the hawk, and the eagle (Ehrenreich, America South). Among various North American Indian tribes the soul hovers as a bird after death (Alexander, Soul). The Mojave Indian's soul undergoes several metamorphoses, in one of which it is an owl (Mac Culloch, op. cit.); the Ojibwas call the bridge of souls the "owl- bridge" (Thomas, op. cit.); the Osages believe that human souls inhabit birds' bodies (Mallery, op. cit., P. 85). The Bilgula Indians think that the living soul is a bird in an egg at the nape of the neck. Only the Shaman can hear it or replace it if it should fly away (Frazer, Taboo, p. 33). When the bird is not actually the soul it is the escort for the soul on the way to the Spirit-world. In Brazil a humming-bird often directs the soul; a turkey-buzzard guides the souls of the Sapona tribe. The Yorubas in West Africa, on hearing of a death, kill a fowl in order that its spirit may guide the soul to heaven. The Port Lincoln tribes in Australia believe that a red-bill accompanies the soul (Thomas, Australia). A curious belief in the Solomon Islands is that a dead person is not aware that he is dead until a kingfisher strikes him on the head, when he becomes a spirit (Thomas, Animals). The Yakut Shaman is buried with a falcon at his head and a cuckoo at his feet; these are the birds which guide his soul after death (Erkes, Some Remarks, quoting Priklonski Ap Bastian). Among the graves of the extinct aboriginal inhabitants of Newfoundland, the Beothuks, one was found which contained a bag of charms and a large number of birds' skulls (Gray and Pilot, Beothuks). This was evidently the grave of a Shaman, whose soul had been accompanied to heaven by Spirit-birds. Feathers symbolise the divine bird and are therefore divine. Mr. von Bothmer has informed the writer that the pictograph for "Maat", the name of the Goddess of Truth in Egypt, is</page><page sequence="69">SIXTY-ONE a feather. Feathers bestow divinity upon the animal or object on which they appear. Keithahn describes how the American Indians of the north-west coast depict human beings with natural ears, but represent supernatural people, birds, and animals with "ears" above their heads. These "ears" are in the form of flicker's feathers. He refers to an old legend in which a salmon was recognised as being supernatural as it had a red feather in its head (Keithahn, Monuments, p. 71-72), which is reminiscent of the crocodile with the feather in the sixth nome of Upper Egypt. The soul may be escorted by feathers instead of by the bird. In Tahiti red-feather amulets were placed on the fingers of the dying as protection for the soul against evil spirits on the way to heaven (Henry, op. cit., p. 200). In Tongking duck-feathers were placed on the bier to enable the soul to cross the river which separates the world of the living from the land of souls (Cabaton, Tongking). In a curious passage in the earliest book of Japan, the birds may be escorts for the soul, or tutelary spirits: "At the Heavenly-young Prince's funeral the wild goose of the river was the head-hanging bearer"; the heron was "the broom-bearer"; the kingfisher was "the person of the august food"; the sparrow was "the pounding woman", and the pheasant was "the weeping woman". The hen-pheasant was a special messenger of the gods. The meaning may be that the bird- gods, impersonated by priests, undertook the funeral duties for the sake of the illustrious young prince (Kojiki, p. ii6-17). Birds also guide the living. When the Yakut Shaman sends his soul on a spirit-journey, it is accompanied by an eagle, white crane, or goose (Czaplicka, Yakuts). A bird directs the Lappland Shaman on his spirit-journeys (Holmberg, Lapps). In an Eskimo drawing of a Shaman curing an ill person, his two assistants have the forms of birds (Nioradze, op.cit., p. 93). In Formosa a bird guides men on hunting expeditions (Campbell, op. cit.); in ancient Japan a god sends a crow eight feet long to guide the Emperor Jimmu through the interior of the island, where savage deities are numerous (Kojiki, p. 165). The bird-origin of the Shaman is seen in Germany where the five-pointed star keeps away evil spirits as the five points resemble the feet of sorcerers, who have the feet of geese or of some other bird (Glory, Gravures rupestres, p. i i), which is reminiscent of the gods with emu feet in Australia. The tutelary deity in Iran is the mysterious immortal Fravashi, soul-companion to the gods and saints as well as to man. It "comes flying as a well-winged bird" (Lehmann, Ancestor-worship). Originally an actual God, the Bird later becomes the companion, messenger, or "shadow" of the god who is, of course, the anthropomorphised form of the original Bird. Sometimes the bird is "owned" by a divine spirit. In Sumer the brilliant black storm-bird has become the companion of the god Ningirsu, but it still has its own shrine in the temple-grounds. Early indications of the importance of birds in Sumer are the copper birds' heads found at</page><page sequence="70">SIXTY-TWO AL-'Ubaid, and the pottery bird-faced figurine wearing a high cap found at Abu Shahrain, site of the ancient city Eridu. Hall considers that the figurine is probably prehistoric (Hall, Season's Work, Fig. I 7 I). The hawk in Egypt is an historical case of the Bird as God. The goose was also a deity; Re, the worshipped sun, is the egg of the goose, which was the bird of the god Amon till i6oo B. C., from which it may be inferred that Amon was originally a goose-god. The goose is a god in many places; the Kojiki mentions a god dressed in goose-skins (p. 102). Among the Hittites the eagle was a god. At Boghaz-Keui, an eagle's head in black stone, larger than life, was found, also a cuneiform fragment which refers to the Temple of the Eagle. A headless stone eagle seven feet high, standing on lions, was discovered at Yarmoola (Garstang, Land of the Hittites, PI. XLIX). At lasily Kaya goddesses ride on double-headed eagles (op. cit., PI. LXV); at Eyuk a double-headed eagle grasping two hares in its talons appears (op. cit., p. 236). The vulture was worshipped by the ancient Arabs in the time of Noah, according to the Koran, and also generally throughout Semitic lands (Noldeke, Arabs). It was, as has been said, the goddess of maternity in Egypt. Hawk-worship exists in various places, some tribes in the Fiji Islands worship a hawk-god (Thomson, Fiji). In Hawaii, the only one of the Hawaiian Islands on which it existed, the hawk was a deity, the symbol of swift justice. Emory thinks that it may have been a form of the sorcerer-deity Uli (Emory, The Hawaiian God 'Jo). In northern Borneo the hawk is the messenger of the Supreme Deity, but it is treated as though it were the actual god. The natives consult it with elaborate rites before leaving home, before beginning agricultural work, or going to war. After a battle a piece of the enemy's flesh is offered to it. Wooden images of the hawk are placed before new homes; images are also kept in the house as protection against illness. (Thomas, op. cit.). In Java, Malaya and Sumatra, the turtle-dove is worshipped (Kruijt, Indonesia). The kingfisher is a god in the Tonga Islands (Moulton, Tongans), and the emu in Australia (Thomas, o it.). To the Buriats (Nioradze, op. cit.) and to the Koryaks the raven is a god (Czaplicka, Siberia). In Korea the falcon was sacred and it was forbidden to kill one (Griffis, Korea). In Japan the gods sent a hen-pheasant to earth as their representative (Kojiki p. 114). In South America the Piaroas of the Orinoco exorcise the evil spirit in a new building by means of the divine toucan, which flies away with the spirit. Sometimes merely an image of the toucan is used. The cassowary is holy in Patagonia (Thomas, op. cit.). The quetzal- bird was divine with the ancient Maya. The beautiful long green feathers were worn by royal persons and priests. Among the Quiches of Guatemala the chief had the name of a bird, and was known as "he of the bird family" (Raynaud, Les Manuscrits, p. 39). The American Indians associate birds with the Supreme Deity, the gods, and the sky.</page><page sequence="71">SIXTY-THREE When the Great Spirit descends to teach ceremonies to the Ojibwas, he comes in the form of a bird, and the candidates for initiation are crowned with feathers, and hold tambourines adorned with feathers and a wing (Mallery, op. cit., p. 82, PI. IV, No. 1). Bird-men represent the sky to the Hopi Indians (Gray, Hopi). The Apaches believe that there are divine spirits in eagles and other birds (Antonio Apache, Apaches). Spirit-ownership of birds by the gods is particularly frequent in Siberia. The Buriats will not eat or drive away the eagle, vulture, raven, loon, or swan because divine spirits live in them (Nioradze, op. cit.). This attitude may be connected with the ancestral soul, since the eagle is the tribe's father, and the swan its mother (Harva, Die religidsen Vorstellungen, etc.). The Yakuts believe that the eagle, white crane and goose are the abodes of divine spirits; these birds assist the Shaman on his spirit-journeys (Czaplicka, Yakuts). The Yakut women pray to the eagle to send them children (Nioradze, op. cit.). The tribes of the Altai consider that it is a crime to kill pigeons or swallows. Among primitive peoples the owl is generally revered as being auspicious; its sinister reputation is later in origin. With the Tungus it is a protector against evil spirits, which it pursues and eats. Owl-feathers are placed with eagle-feathers in the Shaman's head-dress; and sometimes stuffed owls are kept in dwellings as spirit-guardians (Nioradze, op. cit.). The Ainu consider the owl to be the divine messenger of a god; it warns of evil, and is addressed as "Beloved God" and "Dear Little Divinity" (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. '99). To the Pawnee Indians the owl is the chief of night who gives protection and aid. The owl in Brazil is generally connected with supernatural beings (Thomas, op. cit.). In Hawaii it guards against impending danger; its sacred name is " Man-standing-at-the-forest- border". Another name is Owl-man (Emory, op.cit.). In the Popul Vuh, the sacred book of the Qihich's, the owl is evidently an auspicious deity: "They danced the Owl, the Weasel, the Armadillo" (Raynaud, Le Livre du Conseil, p. 69). In Madgascar the souls of sorcerers are called owls (Thomas, op. cit.). Birds were originally gods throughout the Pacific area; later anthropomorphised forms occur at various places. An outstanding Bird-god is Make-make, god of Easter Island, and creator of the sooty tern. His particular cult is unknown elsewhere in Polynesia (Linton and Wingert, Arts, p. 42). Each year, at the beginning of the mating-season of the terns, the priests named the contestants to search for the first egg. The servants of the contestants did the actual searching, and the employer of the successful hunter received the egg, and became the incarnation of the Bird-god for one year, during which time he lived in seclusion and adopted a new name, which became the name of the year. When he died he was buried in a special cemetery reserved for the incarnations of the god. Five cocks were attached to each of his feet when he died, and were untied before burial by priests who had been incarnations of Make-make in previous years (Metraux, Ethnology, p. 339). There may be some suggestion of birds escorting the soul here. The petroglyphs of Make-make depict</page><page sequence="72">SIXTY-FOUR the god as having a bird's head, with a rather long curved beak, more like that of a frigate- bird than that of a tern, and a human body. He often holds an egg in his hand, which is usually three-fingered. He has no wings (P1. VIII). The representations are unique among Bird-deity images; the lines are strongly curved, and have vitality and intensity. The only representations of birds which at all resemble the Easter Island petroglyphs or symbols are found in Peru, in low-relief friezes on the walls of the ancient city of Chan Chan, once the capital of a federation of pueblos on the northern coast. These birds are strikingly similar to some of those on Easter Island. They represent the god Kon, who, in the form of a bird or of a fish, created men and all things, being the king of the sea and of space (Del Pomar, Arte del Peru precolombino, p. i 44). Kon is of course the creator Tiki, or Ti'i, of the Pacific area. The three-fingered hands of the god Make-Make, like the four-fingered hands of the Bird-priest of Lascaux, undoubtedly have a supernatural meaning. Phillipps, discussing the three-fingered hand in Maori carvings, offers the theory that it is derived from the three toes of the bird, and says that several old carvings depict the webbed feet of aquatic birds. He also gives the native theory of a reptile origin, and quotes Graham as saying that three fingers is the sign of descent from a reptile-god ancestor (Phillipps, Maori Carving, p. 8). It seems to the writer that the three fingers may have had both these sources of origin. In the case of Make-make, the hands undoubtedly represent birds' claws. Hentze's theory that the three-fingered hand represents a moon-symbol (Hentze, Mythes et symboles lunaires, p. io8 seq.) may be true as a later meaning; the animal-derivation, in the writer' opinion, gives the original primitive significance. Another Polynesian Bird-deity is found on Lanai, one of the smaller Hawaiian Islands (PI. IX). This deity, with a bird's head and outstretched wing-like arms, is apparently either flying or dancing to represent flight. The strongly curved beak suggests a frigate-bird. Apart from the basic conception the representation is entirely different from the wingless, sedentary deity of Easter Island. Emory, the discoverer of the Lanai deities, says that the bird-figures are found only on the west bank of the valley of Kaunolu, near the remains of a temple. The name of the bank is the same as that of a mythical Bird-deity-Kaneapua; the temple is named Halalu, who was another Bird-deity, a cousin of Kaneapua. These and other gods were the original inhabitants of the island (Emory, The Island of Lanai, p. 120). Since the temple Halalu is the most imposing of all the eleven temples on Lanai, it may be inferred that the bird-cult formerly was intensive, though perhaps not extensive. It evidently was of some duration, as the petroglyphs show two distinct styles, of which the linear type is, Emory says, the earlier. The temple is one of the nine coastal temples, and is about two hundred feet from the sea. Emory refers to the shapes of the deities' arms and legs as being intended to represent "muscles" (Emory, Op. cit., n. p. 99); the writer had previous- ly considered that they were meant to depict feathers. The gods Kane and Kanaloa</page><page sequence="73">SIXTY-FIVE were also birds (Op. Cit., p. 12); these gods correspond to Tane and Ta'aroa in Tahiti. In Tahiti the Bird-gods have become anthropomorphised, and the birds are their "shadows", which has the significance of "souls". All white birds were shadows of the gods; white fowl were presented as peace-offerings. The shadows of Ta'aroa, Creator and Supreme God, were the bird-of-Paradise, the tropic bird, and the albatross: the last was also king of all the birds on atolls. The red parrakeet was the shadow of Tane, God of Beauty, and of Fair Weather. An unusual feature is that the birds sometimes represent subjective qualities: the parrakeet is the shadow of the God of Stability; the surf-duck of the God of Peace; the rail is the shadow of the deity Stability-of-the-Moon; the woodpecker is the shadow of Sacred- ness-holding-anger, a divinity who caused eclipses of the sun and moon; the booby was the shadow of Stability-the-smiter-of-the-sea; a god who calmed the waves (Henry, Ancient Tahiti, p. 388). Every bird, animal and insect seems to have had a connection with divinity. The sea-gull is the shadow of the air-gods; the swallow of the air-goddesses. Green and white titi represented the mountain-gods; the gray plover the water-gods; the ordinary plover the coast-gods. The white sea-swallow protected against accidents; the green wild pigeon was the shadow of forest-ghosts (Henry, op. cit.). The god's canoe, kept at his temple, was large and adorned with sacred feathers. It had a high prow and stern, ending in the carved head of a sea-bird, or the figure of a ti'i, an image connected with Ti'i, the First Man (op. cit., p. 136). The Dravidians of North India worship the peacock as earth-mother and place it on human-sacrificial posts (Crooke, Dravidians). This cult may have some connection with the peacocks of Harappa. Perhaps another manifestation of this belief is found in Malaya, where rice in a basket, shaped like a peacock, is presented to a prospective bride during the betrothal period (Skeat, Malay Magic, PI. 8). The peacock is sacred in various parts of India; the Mori clan of the Bhils in central India worship it with offerings (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 29); the Jats carry its feathers in certain rites as a protection against evil, and smoke the feathers in pipes as a charm against snake-bite (Mackay, op. cit., p. 296). The peacock is reverenced in Burma, Siam, and Persia. A Bird-man as the messenger of God appears in the Talmud, in the legend of Alexander the Great's attempted ascension to heaven - a legend based on the Babylonian Etana. Alexander ascended in a basket placed on the backs of two great birds, before whose beaks he held liver on a spear to induce them to fly upwards. "He ascended till the air became icy cold", when he met a Bird-man. This being addressed him with a remark strangely similar to Confucius's profound answer, so misunderstood by certain nineteenth-century writers, when he was questioned concerning a future life: "While you do not know life, how can you know about death?" (Legge, Analects, p. 241) The Bird-man sends Alexander back to the earth, saying, "Alexander, thou art ignorant of terrestrial things, why desirest thou to understand those of Heaven?" (Langdon, Semitic Mythology, p. 174).</page><page sequence="74">SIXTY-SIX Sometimes only relics of the Bird-god origin remain; the principal god of the southern Aruntas in Australia has the feet of an emu (Thomas, op.cit.); one of the four types of images representing the goddess Astarte has a bird-like beak (Paton, Canaanites). Being divine, birds had foreknowledge. A reference to their powers in Sumer has been given, when Gudea places a holy omen-bird in a shrine (Barton, Royal Inscriptions, p. 225). The Babylonians divined principally from the flight of birds (Zimmern, Babylonia). The royal library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh contained many omen-texts, with directions for interpreting the appearances and actions of birds and other animals. The inscriptions show survivals of ancient animal-worship (Bezold, Literature, Babylonian). In the Assyrian list of the subordinate order of priests, the "bird-prognosticator" is mentioned (Landtmann, Priest). The original function of the earliest sirens, birds with women's heads, was to promise foreknowledge (Shorey, Sirens); the mermaid-siren, luring men to death, is a much later concept. Singalong Burong, ruler of the spirit-world among the Sea-Dyaks of Borneo, took the form of a white-headed hawk, and married all his daughters to the various omen-birds (Frazer, The Dying God, p. 126-7). The prophetic raven has a long range: from western North America, across Asia into the European peninsula. Everywhere he is credited with possessing supernatural wisdom; sometimes he has a sinister aspect; sometimes he is a trickster. The two leading clans of the Haida Indians are the Raven and the Eagle Clans; most supernatural beings belong to the Raven Clan (Chamberlain, Haidas). The raven is one of the sacred birds of the Nutkas of Vancouver Island, the others being the sea-gull and the woodpecker. These birds and a fish are the supernatural beings which give the Shaman his power. The heavenly bird which be- longs to the Sky-chief has the greatest shamanistic power (Sapir, Vancouver Island Indians). The Tungus believe that the raven has the power of prophesying (Shirokogoroff, Psycho- mental Complex, p. 85). In Greece, the raven adds another northern element to that of the bear-cult; Apollo has prophetic ravens. In Scandinavia Odin is accompanied by two ravens. It is believed in Denmark that drinking raven-broth endows one with the powers of a wizard (Thomas, op. cit.). Creation was attributed to birds. There was a general belief in Polynesia that the world was created from an egg. Ta'aroa, "ancestor of all the gods", created himself, and sat in his eggshell revolving in space for millions of years. He created the sky and the earth: "When Ta'aroa shook off his feathers, they became trees, plantain clusters, and verdure upon the land" (Henry, op. cit., p. 338). The gods wore red and yellow feathers, the divine colors. The Semang of the Malay Peninsula believe that the ground-dove created the world (Skeat and Blagden, op. cit., II, p. 192). The Tapuyas, the oldest Brazilian tribe, think that the world was destroyed by a flood and re-built by the water-hen (Spence, Brazil). The birds are associated with various aspects of nature: the sky, wind, storm, rain, fire; *</page><page sequence="75">SIXTY-SEVEN later they are associated with agriculture. The Yakut word for the coat worn by the Shaman when he impersonates a bird, the being of the Upper World, is "Tanara", which means sky (Czaplicka, Yakuts). The Berbers of North Africa call the stars in Canis Major "the noise of a fan or of a bird" (Basset, Berbers). In New Guinea one of the moon- symbols is a bird, and one sun-symbol is the head of a bird. The Tuamotu Islanders believe that the white sea-swallow, messenger of the God of Beauty, Tane, is also the star Deneb in Cygnus (Henry, op. cit., p. 363). The attendant of the Japanese sun-goddess is a bird (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 152). The Maori have a sun-bird deity (see below). According to a Carib tribe, the Bakairi, the sun is a ball of feathers of the red macaw and the toucan, and the moon is a ball of cassicus feathers (Spence, Cosmogony and Cosmology). The Bella-Coola Indians, when desperately poor, sell their children for sacrifices. The children's souls go to live in the sun and become birds (Sumner, Cannibalism). Von Oppenheim considers that the great stylised statue of a bird which he found at Tell Halaf is a sun-bird (Von Oppenheim, op. cit., PI. XIV). At the Swedish Yule, originally a sun-fertility festival, bread is baked in the form of the sun, cocks, hens, and various animals (Rydh, Seasonal Fertility Rites). The bird is very frequently associated with the wind. In ancient Babylonia Adapa "broke the wings" of Shutu, the south-west wind (Langdon, op. cit., p. 176). The hawk was associated with the winds, especially with the north wind, in Egypt (Frankfort, Kingship, p. 37). In Guatemala the great bird Voc flies with the god of winds and storms, Hurakan, the hurricane (Thomas, op.cit.). In Mexico the Fiesta del Volador, which involves the "Birds which dominate the winds," is still performed and will be discussed in Chapter IV. To the American Indians that prehistoric symbol, the cross, often symbolised the four winds, or the four directions. The winds were frequently conceived of as birds; sometimes the cross represents a bird, as for instance with the Dakotas, to whom the cross signifies "the mosquito-hawk spread out" (Spence, Cross). The thunder-bird of the American Indians is reminiscent of the divine black storm-bird of Sumer. To the Iroquois thunder is a man in the form of a turkey (Thomas, op. cit.). The great legendary canoe of Tahiti which possessed "mana", the unseen power, was named "Fanned-by-the-birds" (Henry op. cit., p.126). Natives of the Eastern Sudan are forbidden to touch the nests or the nestlings of a bird of the black- bird species, as otherwise the parent-birds will send a great wind which will ruin the crops (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 22). The god of lightning of the Ewe of West Africa is "a bird which throws out fire." In Natal a white bird causes lightning. The Zulus believe that there is a brown bird where lightning strikes (Thomas, op. cit.). The Aruntas of Australia, whose water-totem is rain, imitate the cry of the spur-winged plover in their ceremonies, as the sound is connected with rain (James, Rain). Occasionally the birds are associated with fire. The god of the Maoris is the sun-bird</page><page sequence="76">SIXTY-EIGHT which stole fire from heaven (Reinach, Orpheus, p. 156). In Namoluk, one of the Caroline Islands, the Master of Flames gave fire to the bird Mwi, who brought it to earth and stored it in trees (Frazer, Balder, II, P. 295). Belief that fire is in wood is also general among the American Indians, and other peoples. Birds guard against fire; the ground-dove in Malaya gives protection against it (Skeat, Malay Peninsula), and the stork has the same role in Egypt and Morocco (Thomas, op. cit.). The California Indians believe that the owl is the deity and guardian of the "big trees" (Frazer, Adonis II, p. iii, n. i). Trees on which eagles have built nests are sacred to the Ostyaks (Frazer, Magic Art, II, p. ii). The Maori priest protects a tree from magicians by hiding its soul, which is the first bird caught in a snare set in the tree. Spells are pronounced over the bird, then it is concealed in the forest, and the tree is safe (Frazer, Adonis, IL, p. I I, n. i). With the coming of agriculture the birds, like the animals, enter upon new functions. In Malaya the soul of the rice is a bird. A man hides his reaper before going to harvest in case he should frighten it away (Frazer, Spirits, I, p. 8 i). A small blue bird which nests in the rice-fields and disappears after the harvest is the soul of the rice in central Celebes (Frazer, op. cit., p. 182). The hawk in Borneo is consulted before any agricultural work is undertaken (Thomas, op. cit.). Among the Mandan and Minataree Indians of northwestern America the agricultural deity is "the Old Woman who never dies". She causes the crops to grow, and birds are her representatives; the wild goose signifies corn, the wild swan gourds, the wild duck beans. When the birds arrive in spring a festival of women is held, at which the old women of the tribe represent the Old Woman deity (Frazer, op. cit., p. 204-5). In Bolivia the condor is invoked before planting crops, beginning new buildings, finishing roofs and before burials (Posnansky, Tihuanacu, II, p. 8). In some cases birds were associated with war. In Tahiti, where there were no large animals, they are particularly important in this connection. The cock was the shadow, or soul, of the god Source-of-Warriors;- the red duck was the shadow of the god Warrior- covered-with-red; the stork represented the god Source-of-Armies. The frigate-bird was the shadow of two war-gods, the first being Dauntless Warrior, moving spirit of the ocean, who had the form of a man. He was covered with yellow feathers; he had a roaring voice; his jaws were the breaking waves. 'Oro, the War God, was the second deity (Henry op. cit., p.384). The woodpecker was sacred to the Roman God of War, Mars (Plutarch, Romulus). In ancient Ireland the Goddess of War and Murder appeared always in the form of a raven. She was usually seen at the death of a great warrior (Gerig, Images, etc.). There may be a connection here with Scandinavia. Shetelig and Falk say that the word "Valkyrie" is derived from ON "valkyrja", which is OE "wocleyrige", a word related to OE "waelceasiga", a "raven". Etymologically, the valkyrie are devourers of the slain (Sketelig and Falk, Scandinavian Atrchaeology, P. 43Xi), and the raven of Ireland may be related to them.</page><page sequence="77">SIXTY-NINE There are certain totems in Australia which have been called "sex totems", since they are associated with groups composed exclusively either of men or of women. The totem represents the creator of sex, and is "brother" to the men of the group, or "sister" to the women, as the case may be. These totems are principally birds. In Victoria and New South Wales they are the wren, the night-jar, or some other small bird. From south Australia to Brisbane the birds are the owl, emu, wren, warbler and goatsucker. The facts that the groups are of one sex only and that the significant terms "sister" and "brother" are used, lead the writer to believe that these so-called "sex totems" are not connected with sex but are really survivals of the animal- and bird-gods of the ancient religious societies, which, as has already been said, were composed only of one sex, and which are in the writer's opinion pre-totemic. Bird-sacrifices were held in many places. Doves in pairs were sacrificed in Sumer, their heads and necks being offered as incense (Barton, op. cit., P. 29). Bird-sacrifices seem to have been frequent among the Hittites. At Tell Halaf a small round basalt altar-table, with pigeons' bones still upon it, was found, standing before an orthostat carved with an image of the sun-disc. Von Oppenheim concludes that a sacrifice to the sun was being performed when the town was captured (von Oppenheim, op. cit., p. 103). Garstang also believes that many of the birds depicted on the 1ittite bas-reliefs may be sacrificial. At Fraktin there is a rock-carving of a large bird resembling a falcon on the altar before a seated goddess (Garstang, op. cit., PI. XLVII). A relief found near Yarre shows a bird and other offerings on a narrow altar between two persons (op. cit., p. 104-5). Since the Hittites, after the birth of a child, sacrificed birds, presumably doves or pigeons, since they symbolised the Goddess of Love and Fertility (Eliade, Metallurgy), it is possible that the bas-relief at Yarre may depict such a sacrifice. The Ainus sacrifice the divine eagle and owl (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 99). In Sumatra cocks are baptised "Prince" and sacrificed. The priest then prophesies from the orientation of the beak (Callet, Terres et peoples, p. 357). The Acagchemem Indians of southern California sacrifice the divine buzzard ritually in all the villages at certain intervals. The birds are not eaten; their skins are used for ceremonial garments (Frazer, op. cit., II, p. 170). A paleolithic element in this ritual is the belief that the buzzards killed in every village are mystically the same bird, so that actually only one and the same sacred buzzard has been sacrificed by the whole tribe. The malevolent birds often have a vague form and cannot always be identified as to species. In Babylonia and Assyria the ostrich sometimes represents an evil creature and appears quite frequently in this role on the cylinder seals (Bossert, Alt-Anatolien, No. 1197). The writer has not found an explanation of this substitution. The Bantees of South Africa fear more than any other malignant spirit a large bird which makes love to women and incites</page><page sequence="78">SEVENTY those who reciprocate its affection to slay those who do not (Mc Call, Theological Records, P. 77). In Java the pontianak, a demon which is the soul of a still-born child, often appears as a bird (Kern, Malay Archipelago). The Malay birth-demon is evidently derived from a night-hawk or an owl, judging from the song, "Langhui, Langhua, Your beak is stumpy, Your feathers are cloth of silk, Your eyes are 'crab's eye' beans" (Skeat and Blagden, op. cit., II, p. 13). Some evil birds particularly attack the soul. At the fete of the dead held by the Dyaks in Borneo sorcerors are always present to drive off the evil spirit- birds which try to carry away the soul (Goloubew, L'Age du bronze). The Seminole Indians of Florida place burnt wood in the hands of the dead to protect their souls from malignant birds on their way to the sky (MacCulloch, State of the Dead, quoting Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Vol. V). Among the Mindanao an evil bird called the Balbal appears at night in human form and eats the dead (Keane, Aborigines). In Tongking the Tai fear chicken-spirits which enter into people, particularly women, and cause them to have the evil eye (Cabaton, Tongking). Among the Buriats of Siberia the souls of young women and girls may become malevolent birds if their fathers place tinder on their graves. Their souls can assume animal- as well as bird-forms, but the bird's beak always remains (Klemente, Buriats). The Aruntas of Australia believe that the spirit of a man slain in battle follows his enemies in the form of a bird which cries like a child. It is dangerous to the slayer and will injure him, particularly in the right arm and shoulder (Frazer, Taboo, p. 177). The screech-owl was associated with death by the ancient Maya; it was ill-omened and known as the Moan bird (Spinden, Maya Art, p. 79). Demonic birds appear among the gentle bird-gods of Tahiti. They belong to King Puna of the land called Hiti-Marama, Border-of-the-Moon. "There came with large outspread wings an immense black-bird-fiend with fierce glance and wild screech". It had a great hooked beak (Henry, Op. cit., p. 494), and was the leader of all the evil birds. In the Tuamotuan version of the story Rata breaks off the wings of the demon, and he and the gods set them up as sails for their ship (Op. cit., p. 504). The bird's huge shining black feathers are reminiscent of the Sumerian brilliant black storm-bird. There are many images of Bird-deities in the Western Hemisphere. Four are illustrated (Pls. X, XI, XII, XIII). P1. X represents one of the condor-deities on the Sun Door of the Temple of the Sun, Kalasasaya, at Tihuanacu, Bolivia. The curious attitude suggests both kneeling and running. The deity wears a crown composed of a Fish with the Snail and two Fish-heads rising from it. Fish-heads appear on the raised wing and the large scepter ends in a Fish-head. Posnansky considers that the condor had several significances; it meant "the</page><page sequence="79">SEVENTY-ONE bearer of solar light and heat"; at times it means "free movements through space"; also a thunderbolt, "an expression of hierarchy", and a totem (Posnansky, Tihuanacu, I, p. ii2). The Fish meant water, mist, clouds (op. cit., I, X i 9). For the Snail ideogram Posnansky has no explanation (op. cit., I, p. 1 22). The Snail in Mayan Art has been interpreted as meaning the winter solstice. An example at Palenque, where the Rain-god appears in a shell, with leaves and ears of corn rising from his hand, and with the face of the Corn-god resting on the top of the shell (Spinden, Maya Art, p. 82-3), implies a connection with fertility or perhaps with earth. PI. XI illustrates a gold disc from Cocle, Panama, showing two Bird- deities with crested heads, long hooked beaks, and clawed hands and feet. The natives of Cocle were sun-worshippers (Lothrop, Coclt, I, p. 29); these deities may have some solar significance. PI. XII shows a conch-shell from Temple Mound, Oklahoma, with an eagle- deity engraved upon it. The head is partly human and partly bird-like; the nose is a beak, and the mouth is surrounded by feathers. The deity has a human body and legs, and a bird's wings and tail. PI. XIII illustrates two views of an ivory spear-head made by the Tlingit Indians of Alaska, which represents an eagle-Shaman. The figure is human, with a bird's head wearing a small hat, and having wings instead of arms. The face has the slyness of the raven, but the beak is portrayed in the manner usually employed for depicting eagles' beaks. Many other examples could be given. A condor-feline deity is found on the flat carvings at Chavin, Peru (Bennett, Chavin Stone Carving, Fig. 3). A gold figure from Quimbaya, Colombia, has a head-dress of two mushroom-like pillars, and legs which are large birds' heads with long broad beaks (Keleman, AMfedieval American Art, P1. 215, a). A figure from Oklahoma has a bird's head with an enormous beak (Keleman, op. cit., PI. 280, c). Copper and shell discs engraved with eagle-headed, eagle-clawed human forms have been found in burial-mounds in Ohio, Georgia, and Tennessee. Martin, Quimby and Collier consider that the Indians had copied Mexican objects or had heard of Huastecan religious objects (Martin, Quimby and Collier, Indians, p. 362). The Huastecas of Mexico are Mayan in origin, and the linear quality of these engravings is more Mayan than Mexican. Mallery illustrates a bird-deity with outspread wings and no arms which was found in Siberia, and which is, he says, identical with one drawn by the Ojibwa Indians in western America (Mallery, op.cit., Fig. 206). This particular tribe has many Asiatic features; the bear-ceremonies performed by the Ojibwas today are identical with the rites of the Tungus in the Amur region. Another Tlingit Bird-man image appears on a halibut-hook. This figure, divided longitudinally, is composed of a half-man and a half-bird with a hooked beak. (Davis, Native Arts, P1. 77). This method of blending the two images is unique so far as the writer knows. The Kwakiutl fishermen call their halibut-hooks their "younger brothers", and pray to them before beginning to fish (Boas, Ethnology of the Kwvakiutl, II, p. 13 20). It is probable that for the Tlingit also the halibut-hooks have supernatural powers.</page><page sequence="80">SEVENTY-TWO Images of Bird-men in the round are also found in the Pacific area. The handle of a fly-whisk from Tahiti is topped by two seated human figures with birds' heads, which have protuberant eyes and large beaks. The figures are seated back to back; the backs and the birds' heads merge (Linton and Wingert, Arts, p. 31). Part of a carved box from New Zea- land represents a man, a woman and a child; each one has three-fingered hands, and the child has a bird's head (Poncetton and Portier, Les Arts sauvages, P1. III). A wooden mask from New Caledonia has a huge hooked beak (op. cit., P1. VI). An extraordinary development of the Bird-man image is found in the Sepik River region of New Guinea, where the nose of the human figure becomes a prolonged beak sometimes reaching to the feet. Sometimes the beak ends in the neck and head of a bird (Linton and Wingert, op. cit., P. Ilo). Occasionally it is more complicated; in one instance the figure has a bird's head, and the long ridged beak extends to the feet and ends in a deer's head which has large tusks (Poncetton and Portier, op. cit., P1. XX). This prolongation of the face into a bird's beak is also found in Africa. The emblem of the Senufo tribe in the south-western Sudan is a bird, "Kono", evidently the female tribal ancestor. It appears in bas-reliefs on the doors of sacred huts and chiefs' houses. Masks with elongated beak-faces represent the "Bird-woman", and are worn in ritual dances (Lem, Sudanese Sculpture, p. 24 and P1. 50). The divine birds are numerous. Among those which can be identified are: the albatross, bird-of-Paradise, black-bird, blue-bird (of Celebes), booby, buzzard, cassicus, cassowary, cock, condor, crane, crow, cuckoo, dove, duck, eagle, emu, falcon, fowl, frigate-bird, goat- sucker, goose, ground-dove, hawk, heron, horn-bill, humming-bird, ibis, kingfisher, loon, macaw, night-jar, ostrich, owl, parakeet, parrot, peacock, pheasant, pigeon, plover, puffin, quetzal, rail, raven, red-bill, sea-gull, sea-swallow, sparrow, stork, swallow, swan, tern, titi, toucan, tropic bird, turkey, turkey-buzzard, vulture, wagtail, warbler, water-hen, wren. The eagle apparently leads as the bird most frequently deified.</page><page sequence="81">SEVENTY-THREE CHAPTER FOUR CHINA: THE PERIOD OF PREHISTORY: LAST CENTURIES OF THE SHANG DYNASTY: EARLY CHOU: MIDDLE CHOU: LATE CHOU, WITH A DIGRESSION ON THE DRUMS OF DONG-SO'N: LATE CHOU-HAN: HAN: SIX DYNASTIES: THE PERIOD OF PREHISTORY BISHOP WHITE, referring to the theory that the Chinese have lived in Asia "from the highest antiquity", says that "this theory seems now to be conclusively proved. .... The evidence for this conclusion lies mainly in the fields of paleontology and prehistoric anthropology" (White, Bone Culture, p. 6). There is, he continues, "nothing to show a break in the continuity of life on the Asiatic continent" (op. cit., p. 9). Weidenreich has proved that Sinanthropus Pekinensis, tentatively placed in the Pleistocene era, is more akin to the modern Chinese than to Neanderthal Man; the same characteristics of the jaw and the upper incisors exist in both. Peking Man is now generally considered to have been one of the ancestors of the Chinese people (op. cit., p. 9). It seems probable that Eastern Asia, the home of Peking Man, Pithecanthropus, and even more primitive types whose remains have been recently discovered by Weidenreich, was one of those centers where homo sapiens developed independently. Beyond the known long continuous history of China lies an unknown longer continuous prehistory. The nineteenth-century theory of a western origin for China, the Chinese language, or Chinese culture, still appears periodically, though, even without the anthropological evidence there are such great psychological differences between China and the Near East that it is difficult to understand how anyone could maintain the theory. The dissimilarities of thought and reaction, after each people has passed through the neolithic era, are fundamental. Sumer, the surrounding countries, India, all had the Mother Goddess. The sacred pole is found in Sumer, Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia, Syria, with the Hebrews; in India, Indo-China, Indonesia, Polynesia; among many of the American Indians and the Alaska Indians. There is no evidence that China ever had the sacred pole (Barton, Poles and Posts). The Chinese conception of the relation between man and nature resulted in a dynamic harmony between the two which is as characteristic of China as its absence among other peoples is typical.</page><page sequence="82">SEVENTY-FOUR China's bone-culture is unique; and so far as the writer can discover, the best scholars consider that the script is indigenous. The differences from other countries, then, are the facts to be emphasised, if one assumes the attitude of Brinton: "An acute philosophical writer has stated that the superficial observer is apt to be impressed with the similarities of objects; while the profounder student finds his attention more profitably attracted to their differences" (Brinton, Essays, p. 66). Compared with many other countries, very little work has been done on prehistoric China; most of the material so far known is neolithic. The Chinese, in the writer's opinion, are a people who in the primitive stage had the same basic concepts as the rest of mankind in that stage, and who, in a very long period of settled development, free from outside influences, evolved from their own consciousness an exceedingly original and distinctive culture. The last paragraph of Metraux's Ethnology of Easter Islandcontains an important truth: "The aim of this book has been to show that Easter Island is a local Polynesian culture which developed from an archaic and undifferentiated Polynesian civilisation. But I hope that another lesson may be drawn from this book-the fact that cultures are not static, that they do not need external stimulus and influence to develop and reach some degree of perfection. On the most solitary inhabited island in the world, Easter Islanders were able to develop and perfect the culture which they received from the Polynesian ancestors to the west." It is certainly not impossible, therefore, that the Chinese, with their extraordinary mental- ity, originality, and imagination, and with the many resources of their extensive country, could have attained their civilisation without "external stimulus and influence". In a previous book, ECSLVS, the writer suggested that the early Chinese of the Shang dynasty were derived from an amalgamation of two peoples-one a northern tribe, the Tungus, and the other the neolithic so-called Black Pottery people. The Tungus, who have been called "the gentry of Siberian aborigines" (Czaplicka, Tungus, quoting Castren), con- tributed the many northern elements found in Shang. Creel has enumerated some of these: the sleeved coat, the composite bow, the semi-lunar knife, the rectangular knife (Creel, Studies, p. 247). Others are divination by the shoulder-bones of animals, game-drives, bloody animal-sacrifices (Hallowell, Bear-Ceremonialism, p. 158). Most important, because most psychological, are certain ceremonies: the rites of summoning bird- and animal-spirits after the manner of the Shaman of Siberia (Biot, Chou Li, XXII, i8); the ceremony in which an official impersonated a bear, which is unmistakably derived from the rites of the Tungus, apparently from those of the Amur region (Biot, op. cit., XXXI, 3 7) ; the taking of the coffin through a hole in the wall of the ancestral temple instead of through the door (Li Ki, II, I, II, 33) which is similar to the funeral rites of the Tungus, Telingits, Samoyeds, Ostyaks, Tchuktuks and the Asiatic Eskimos, who avoid the door of the tent and lift the tent-cloth</page><page sequence="83">SEVENTY-FIVE to remove the corpse (Harva, Religious Conceptions of the Altai People, p. 282). An ancient custom of the Shang people is still practiced by the paleoasiatic Koryaks. In times of pestilence the Shang killed animals and placed them at the sides of the city-gates (Li Ki, IV, 1, 111, i6, p. 266); the Koryaks during a pestilence slaughter a dog and wind its entrails around two posts. People pass between the posts and are then safe, as the demon of pestilence cannot follow them (Frazer, Balder, p. 179). The connection of the Black Pottery people with those of Shang has been definitely proved by Creel. The former had cultural elements which appear in no other neolithic people in China, but which are found in the culture of the Shang people. Among these are the prototypes of the oracle bones; structures built on pounded earth; the making of white pottery, and of other pottery in forms which later appear in Shang to such an extent that Creel says that the Shang technique is a "continuation" of the pottery technique of Ch'eng- tzu-yai (Creel, Studies, p. 19 i). Cultural objects of the Black Pottery people have been found below those of the Shang. The Black Pottery people also had settlements in Shantung. In the writer's opinion, indications of the origin of the Chinese point to the north and to the east. The identity of primitive fundamental conceptions, the similarity of reactions in the stage of the collective unconscious, become altered as layers of different experience begin to cover the essential similarity, yet the early state of mind continues in a certain measure into the neolithic period, as may be seen from the similarity of neolithic symbols in all parts of the world. The cross, the circle, the circle containing the cross, the circle containing dots, the spiral, the meander, the swastika, appear almost everywhere. They are found in places where contact is not possible; there are also instances where a symbol does not appear, though contact with places where it is found is known to exist. The swastika, for instance, appears in North America; also in Iran, but not in Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, or Assyria (Herzfeld, Iran, p. 2i). The three-fingered hand is almost universal; and a figure standing or squatting with bent knees and upraised arms bent at the elbows appears so frequently and in such diverse places that the position might be designated as "the neolithic posture". Such figures are found on pottery of the Al-Ubaid period in Sumer (op. cit., p. 28); at Tell Halaf and Mussian (op. cit., p. 31), and in neolithic Bohemia (op. cit., Fig. 27); among the ancestral images of the Morioris of the Chatham Islands (Skinner, Morioris, p. 6o); among the symbols on the tablets of Easter Island (M'raux, Ethnology, p. 408, 94j), where there is also an image of a man with a bird's tail in this pose (op. cit., Fig. 28); the figure occurs in the New Hebrides (Linton and Wingert, Arts, p. 87); in the Sepik River region of New Guinea (op. cit., p. 122), and in Dutch New Guinea (op. cit., p X3). M. l'Abbe Glory says that such figures are found among the priests and priestesses of Egypt, Phoenicia, Sumer, the Aegean, with the Hebrews, the Graeco-Latins, and later on in the catacombs and</page><page sequence="84">SEVENTY-SIX on Christian sarcophagi. According to Tacitus, images in this posture were found among the Druids (Glory, Gravures rupestres, p. 12). It appears in ancient Chavin de Huantar, Peru (Bennett, Chavin, Fig. 20). With the Kiatexmut Innuit tribes of Alaska, pictographs of figures in this position signify "Shaman" (Mallery, Pictographs, Fig. I95). The same symbol, however, does not always have the same meaning everywhere; this is particularly true of the simpler symbols. With the Hidatsa Indians the circle enclosing dots means an earth-lodging with poles supporting the roof (op. cit., Fig. 169); among the western Innuits it represents an island with huts (op. cit., Fig. 47); with the Dakota Indians circles signify cycles of time; a small circle means a year, a larger one a longer period (op. cit., p. 88). All the symbols mentioned above appear in China; some on the neolithic pottery; some on the ritual vessels of Shang; some on the Shang white pottery. None of them, in the writer's opinion, need imply any external contact. It may be generally stated that the further back in time one goes the less necessary it becomes to postulate contact as an explanation of similarities or identities. The earliest neolithic animal-images so far known in China are those of the bird and the tiger. A large bird carved in nephrite is in the Nelson Gallery. It is said to have been found south of Tai-yuan-fu in Shansi. The technique is primitive and simplified; the wings are amorphously suggested; no feathers are represented. The bird has a rounded, rather dove-like head with no crest, bulging eyes, and a short, very broad beak. The head has a tortoise-like aspect (PI. XIV). The only living creature depicted on the vessels of the Black Pottery people is a bird, whose head appears on covers as a knob or as a handle. This bird is also crestless and also has bulging eyes; its beak is of medium length, and curves downward (Ch'e'ng-tzu-yai PI. Xi IO, II1). The tiger is represented by a small stone image, pierced to be worn as an amulet, which implies that it had a protective power. It was found by Andersson at Sha-kuo-t'un in Fengtien (Erkes, A Neolithic Idol?). It foreshadows the importance of the historic symbolic tiger, and suggests a past of tiger-worship, of which fragments remain. Certain of these are found in the Chan-hai-king; there is one mountain called Jla tete de tigre)) (p. 157), and another called ((montagne de la queue de tigre)) (p. 126). There are various deities with the tails of tigers or of leopards (ECSL VS, pp. 32-33 ). The most important of these deities is Hsi Wang Mu, the famous western Queen Mother. Salmony has suggested to the writer that these tailed deities are descendants of the tailed paleolithic priests (ECSL VS, p.33). Like the tiger, Hsi Wang Mu is always associated with mountains and the west. Some passages from early writers quoted by Professor Dubs uphold this theory of the tiger-origin: "Chuang-tse: the Mother Queen of the west attained it (the Tao), and thereby secured her place on the narrow mountain; no one knows her beginning, no one knows her end"</page><page sequence="85">SEVENTY-SEVEN (Dubs, An Ancient, etc.). In a note to this passage Dubs gives the word "cave" as being one of the interpretations of the word which he translates "mountain". It seems to the writer that "cave" would be more correct here; the adjective "narrow" is then applicable; further- more, other references specifically mention a cave. Legge translates the final sentence as though it referred to the Tao: "No one knows Its beginning, no one knows Its end." (Legge, Writings of Kwvang-sze, I, P. 245). "Shan-hai-king: Three hundred and fifty 1i farther west are the Jade Mountains (Yu-shan). Here it is where the Mother Queen of the west lives. The form of Hsi Wang Mu is like that of a human being, with a leopard's tail, tiger's teeth, which are good for whistling, and tangled hair. She wears a tall jade comb (or plume) in her hair. She has charge of Heaven's calamities upon the five (types of) crimes." This passage dates from before the second century, B. C. (Dubs, op. cit.). "Shan-hai-king, i6, 45, 5a: On the south of the western sea, and on the shores of the Shifting Sands, back of the Red River, and in front of the Black River, there are great mountains called the Kun-lun Mountains. They are inhabited by a deity with the face of a human being, and the body of a tiger, and with stripes and a tail, both of which are (spotted with) white. ..... In these Kun-lun mountains there is a person wearing a high hair-comb, with tiger's teeth, a leopard's tail, living in a cave, called Si Wang Mu." In Sz-ma Siang-ru's prose poem on the Great Emperor, he says of Hsi Wang Mu: "She is brilliant with her white head and high jade comb, yet she dwells in a cave" (Dubs, op. cit.). The gloss to this by Jang Yi says: "These Yin Mountains are in the Kun-lun Mountains, 2700 li to the west. The figure of the Mother Queen of the west is like that of a human being, with a leopard's tail, a tiger's head, and tangled hair which shines on her white head. She has a stone capital city with a golden house and a cave in which she lives. The three green birds..... have charge of taking food to the Mother Queen of the west on the north of the high Kun-lun Mountains" (op. cit.). The three green birds have a mountain named after them in the Shan-hai-king (II, 55). In Ban Gu's Treatise on the Principles of Geographical Arrangements, it is stated: "Liu Chiang, northwest, outside the border, there is the stone chamber of the Si Wang Mu, north of the Lake of the Immortals and the Salt Pond" (Dubs,op.cit.). The Lake of the Immortals isKoko-nor. The references to cave-dwelling - the "stone chamber" certainly implies a cave - to the tiger's teeth and leopard's tail, the association with the human-headed tiger, which probably represents an early anthropomorphised form of the Tiger-Goddess, the association with mountains and the west, all suggest the tiger-origin of the western Queen Mother. Hsi Wang Mu has continued into modern times; Chavannes speaks of her shrine on T'ai-shan, where she is called (ala vieille mere qui n'est jamais n~ex) (Chavannes, Le Teai-chan, p. 117), which is reminiscent of Chuang-tse's "No one knows her beginning".</page><page sequence="86">SEVENTY-EIGHT The bird and the tiger raise the curtain on the symbolic animals of China, and play leading roles on the religious and the supernatural stages for several thousand years. THE LAST CENTURIES OF THE SHANG DYNASTY Present knowledge of Chinese history begins with the last Shang capital, An-yang. The articles discovered in the tombs there obviously represent a very late stage of an ancient culture. Among the objects found are marble sculptures; fragments of a distinctive white pottery, decorated infrequently with animals and principally with geometric designs; beautifully carved and decorated bones; oracle bones, on which were incised or written questions asked by the Shang rulers to be answered by the divining-priests; small jades, usually bird-forms; bronze helmets; bronze ceremonial weapons; bronze chariot-equipment; and the splendid bronze ritual vessels used in the rites of the official religion. The ritual vessels and the oracle bones are the most important groups for this study. The origin of the bronzes lies somewhere in the unknown centuries before An-yang; their unsurpassed technique and the advanced stylisation of the decor denote a long previous history. Some writers still attribute a western origin for bronze-making in China. The present writer can find no reason for this; indeed, it seems improbable for several reasons. If the introduction of bronze-making into both Egypt and China came from the Near East, it is strange that the much-nearer country should not have learned the process long before the distant one. Wainwright refers to an inscription mentioning "Asiatic Copper" of the Sixth Dynasty, or later, and thinks that Egypt may have sometimes made bronze by smelting ores from Byblos. But tin was not smelted till the Eighteenth Dynasty. The first painting which depicts bronze-making is in the latter part of the reign of Amenhotep III, c. 1385- 1370, B.C. (VWainwright, Egypt, etc.). The ritual vessels found at An-yang are at least as old as that city, c. 1400 B. C., and some may be much older. Certainly they had reached a high stage of development before 1324 B. C. To believe in a western origin of bronze- making for China, it must be assumed that a large group of miners, tool-makers, and skilled bronze-workers left the Near East some centuries before An-yang was settled, and undertook a perilous journey of several thousand miles which would have required several years to achieve, during which time they left no evidence of their presence on the way, and once arrived in China, left no trace of any foreign influence in either symbolism or shape on the bronzec. What could be the motive for such an undertaking? What evidence is there that China was known to the Near Eastern world circa i 8oo -i 6oo B. C.? The existence of China was unknown to Herodotus, who states that India is "the furthest region of the inhabited world to the East" (Herodotus, I, P. 261). No evidence or tradition of the presence of foreigners exists in China; Yetts has discovered a tradition that copper, tin, and other</page><page sequence="87">SEVENTY-NINE metals were mined forty ]i north-west of An-yang in the T'ung Shan, the Copper Hills (Yetts, An-yang, etc.). The shapes of many of the vessels are found nowhere but in China; there are no Near Eastern symbols on the bronzes; the technique is derived from an earlier wood-carving; it therefore seems that, judging by the present stage of knowledge, an indigenous origin of bronze-making is indicated. The principal source of information concerning the bronzes lies in the bronzes them- selves. It might be expected that the oracle bones, incised with the questions of the Shang rulers, would supplement or explain the symbolism of the ritual vessels, but a marked dis- crepancy is at once apparent. From the questions on the oracle bones it is evident that already at that distant period the Chinese had developed two of their most characteristic attitudes of thought throughout their long history -regard for agriculture and reverence of the ancestral spirits. Many of the questions concern the harvests; and Creel says that, judging by the oracle bones, the Shang rulers sacrificed to their ancestors more than to all the other gods put together (Creel, Birth of China, p. 178). The gods referred to in the questions are shadowy figures; among them are Shang-ti, the supreme deity; the Dragon woman; the snake spirit,-Creel feels doubtful concerning this translation; "Above and Below"; the wind Deity; and the "Western Mother" (Creel, Birth of China, p. i8o-i). It is difficult to see any connection between these spirits and the bronzes, where the figures, shown on geometric backgrounds, are exclusively those of animals and birds. The fact is that there is no close connection. The deities of the oracle bones represent the beliefs of the Shang rulers in the last centuries of the Dynasty; the symbolism of the ritual vessels represents the beliefs of their ancestors; that is to say, these symbols are relics of prehistoric animal- worship. Belief, Thomas says, changes far more rapidly than ritual; and here vessels depicting ancient animal-gods are used in rites for worshipping ancestral souls and the spirits of Nature. Since the decor on many primitive objects is derived from an animal-form, though at first sight there seems to be no connection with any animal - as, for instance, the Siberian ivory tail referred to in Chapter II -it seems probable that the geometric background on the Shang bronzes may have an animal-origin. Though the background is stylised beyond the possibility of certain identification, the constantly repeated motif suggests a convention- alised snail-shell to the writer. Shells of various kinds adorn the skeletons in many graves in both hemispheres; head-dresses of snail-shells have been found. In Egypt a pre-dynastic statue of the God Min wears a girdle on which are a lion, a bull, an elephant, a sawfish, and shells (Baumgartel, The Three Colossi from Koptos). Min, whose worship was of long dura- tion, was the God of Fertility: probably the symbols on his girdle had this significance. In Tahiti, formerly, every individual had, beside the family tutelary deity at the family marae (temple), his own tutelary spirit in or near the marae, to whom he made invocations. The spirit might be a stone, a tree, a lizard or a snail (Henry, op. cit., P. 142). Some of the</page><page sequence="88">EIGHTY northern Shaman wear conical shells as part of their ceremonial costumes (Nioradze, op. cit.). The cowrie shell appears frequently on the sacred vessels; it is possible that another shell also had a supernatural significance. The usual interpretation of the background is that it represents the lei-wen, but since animal-worship antedates worship of the natural forces, it seems more probable to the writer that the background is associated with the earliest animal- symbols - the tiger, snake, cicada, birds - than that it is the product of a state of mind which was later than those symbols. There may be two connections between the deities referred to on the oracle bones and the symbolic animals on the bronzes. If the "Western Mother" is Hsi Wang Mu, there is a link with the Tiger; if the term "snake spirit" is correctly interpreted there is a link with the many snakes on the bronzes, which appear on both the food-vessels and the wine- vessels, being particularly frequent on one of the most ancient of the latter, the Ku. The snake is a Yin symbol, being connected with water and earth, and there are indications that it is associated with the Female Ancestors; to dream of a snake means the birth of a daughter (Legge, Shi King, II, IV, V, 6, 7). Some of the earliest ritual vessels are inscribed with the figure of an animal, either alone, or within or beside the ya king Cartouche. Karlgren lists the animals represented as being "stags, rhinoceroses, sparrows, cocks, turtles, horses, sheep, fishes, scorpions, elephants, tigers, etc." Some of these are sacrificial or votive animals; some signify the names of the donors (Karlgren, Some Fecundity Symbols). Animal-names also appear in the early part of the Shu King, three men suggested for Minister of Forestry are named Tiger, Bear, and Grizzly Bear (Shu King, Canon of Shun, IL, I). The Minister of Music is named Khwei, (Kuei), (op. cit.), a name connected with the alligator through the great drums which were covered with alligator-skin (ECSL VS, p. 77); the name of the Minister of Communications is Dragon. Lightning, in the writer's opinion, was probably the origin of this serpentine creature, whose later form is apparently derived from the composite Shang tiger. Both the Tiger and the crestless Bird of the neolithic era appear on the bronzes. By far the most important animal-deity is the Tiger, whose predominance suggests that it may have been a deity both for the Tungus and for the Black Pottery people before their amalgama- tion. The Tungus people still have much the same ceremonies for the tiger that they have for the bear. Since the ritual bronzes represent a very late stage, the Tiger's body has dwindled, and the hind-legs have usually disappeared. The head is the principal part depict- ed; sometimes it appears with no body. It may be a true tiger's head with round ears, or it may wear the horns of the water-buffalo, or those of the sacrificial bulls or the ram. This fact indicates the age of the Tiger-cult, as a composite animal is a late conception. It is less divine than the original animal, and with the loss of its divinity, it has also lost its potential enmity, and usually it becomes a guardian spirit. Instances of this are the scorpion-men off</page><page sequence="89">EIGHTY-ONE Sumer who guard the gates of the rising and setting sun; who later become even more composite as the scorpion-bird-men who guard the palace-gates of the Hittite monarchs (Von Oppenheim, Tell Halaf, Pls. XLI, a, b; XLII, a), and who also appear on the boundary- stelae of the Kassites (Hall, Babylonian and Assyrian Sculpture, PI. X, center). In Egypt the composite griffin was "the destroyer of the King's enemies". It was an official symbol, and was not worshipped (Frankfort, Notes). Of the Egyptian animal with a crocodile's head and a lion-and-hippopotamus body which appears in scenes of the last judgment, Wiedemann says, "Generally the animal seems to have been placed there simply as guardian to the Fields of the Blessed, but sometimes it is likened to Set" (Wiedemann, Religion of the Ancient Egyptians). The Sphinx also is a guardian. On the Shang bronzes the Tiger's head appears far more often in a composite than in a natural form, which means that the original Tiger- god has become a composite Tiger-guardian of the souls of the ancestors of the Shang kings; the Tiger now protects the spirits which have displaced him as a deity. Vestiges which suggest early Tiger-rituals remain. The ancient sacrificial vessel hsien consists of a bowl-shaped part resting on a li tripod (ECSL VS, P1. 30); the character meaning hsien contains the character for li beneath a pictograph of the Tiger. Creel says that instances exist where the character for li is omitted, and only the pictograph of the Tiger remains (Creel, Studies, pp. 208-9). A connection between the Tiger and a ritual involving the hsien is implied. The late Helen Chapin stated that the character for hsi, meaning a theatrical performance, contains pictographs of a tiger, an axe, and a ritual vessel; also that there are at least seven vessels besides the hsien, whose characters contain the Tiger pictograph (Chapin, Leaves, pp. 25-3 i). The components of the character hsi suggest an early ritualTiger-dance, involving a sacrifice. The ChouLi states thatwild animals were sacrificed: ((Dompteur d'animaux. II est charge de nourrir les animaux frroces, de les instruire, de les apprivoiser. Quand il y a un sacrifice il livre les animaux feroces, qui doivent y etre immoles)) (Chou Li, XXX, 43). Comm. B says that these animals were the tiger, leopard, bear, and others of a similar sort. A ceremony in which offerings were made to the Tiger is described in the Li Ki, where it was part of the great Ka' sacrifice to the Earth: "They met the (representatives of the) cats, because they devoured the rats and mice (which injured the fruits) of the fields, and (those of) the tigers, because they devoured the (wild) boars (which destroyed them). They met them and made offerings to them" (Legge, LiKi, IX, if, io). The "representatives" of the Tiger, and the performers of the dance Hsi were in all probability Tiger-priests or Shaman, who may have some connection with an unexplained motif on the sacred vessels of Shang. This is the ornament which appears on the Tiger's head between the ears or horns, as the case may be. Hentze interprets this decoration as being a cicada. This is clearly true in one case (ECSL VS, P1. 36), but the instance is atypical. 11</page><page sequence="90">EIGHTY-TWO Priest considers that the ornament represents the Owl; the objection to this theory is that the Shang owls are stylistically later than the Tiger. The writer suggests that the ornament may be derived from the head-dress worn by the Tiger-priest when impersonating the Tiger. The Tungus Shaman wears a bird-head-dress with various ornaments when im- personating a bird; antlers with various ornaments when impersonating a deer of the lower world. Among the Indians of northwestern America, the head-dress of the Shaman appears on the representations of the supernatural animals. Inverarity illustrates a "dance shirt" of the Haida Indians, on which a Bear is applique in red. The front paws are raised in the neolithic posture, which, as has been said, signifies "Shaman" for some of the Indian tribes, and on the head between the ears rises the tall segmented hat of the Shaman or Chief. Below the hat is a lozenge-form, curiously similar to that usually found on the forehead of the Shang Tiger (Inverarity, Art, No. 4). Davis illustrates a white buckskin of the type often used for "dance shirts" on which is painted the image of a Beaver in the neolithic posture with a tall, rectangular ornament between the ears. The painting of the ornament suggests segments (Davis, Native Arts, No. 173). A Beaver at the foot of a totem pole also wears the segmented hat (Barbeau, Totem Poles, p. 125). An early Haida carved slate figure wears a "dance apron" on the front of which is a Bear's head with the segmented hat (Inverarity, op. cit., No. i8i). Another Haida figurine is that of a woman-Shaman holding ceremonial rattles of an early type; on her "dance apron" is the emblem of the Sea-bear with the ceremonial hat (Inverarity, op. Cit., No. 227). The ornament between the ears or the horns of the Shang Tiger varies; there are two prin- cipal types of which the taller and the more ornate is the more frequent. There are variations within the types. Plates 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, ECSL VS, illustrate the high complex ornament; Plates 1, 3,4,11 (op. cit.) illustrate the lower, simpler form, which sometimes seems to be merely an extension of the head of the Tiger. PIs. 2, 49 show an intermediate form. The taller ornament usually has the so-called "hooked wings"; they may represent the fangs of the Tiger. Figures of a man-tiger form exist in Shang. On some fragments of white pottery vessels, vestiges of a tiger-headed figure in the neolithic posture appear. The upraised arms have three claws; the figure is very much conventionalised, the body being merely geometric ornament. None of the fragments show the whole figure; the legs are missing (Umehara, Anyang, II, p. 17). A small white marble tiger, found at An-yang, is not in the neolithic posture but is seated like a human being. Its body is covered with animal-symbols (Pelliot, Royal Tombs, Fig. iv). These figures may be vestiges of an ancient ritual involving a masked Tiger-priest. Perhaps a figure on a white marble ting, also found at An-yang, should be included as a Shaman with those described above. Here the body is more human, and the head is composite, with long branching horns, which are atypical and seem to be a combination of several kinds of horns. The figure is in the neolithic posture, though *</page><page sequence="91">EIGHTY-THREE squatting rather than standing; the raised hands are three-clawed (Karlbeck, An-yang Marble Sculptures, Fig. i). A survival of the posture exists on the ritual bronzes, where the Tiger is sometimes found with upraised paws. This almost invariably occurs when he is wearing the crooked horns of the Bull sacrificed to the spirits of the land and grain. Besides the Tiger, the water-buffalo, and the sacrificial animals, which usually occur as the Tiger's attributes -the most important animals represented on the ritual vessels are the snake, the cicada, another reptilian form differing from the snake, and four recurring types of birds. The Owl, which is stylistically later than the birds of the four categories, or than the various birds on the covers and the handles of the vessels, appears usually on particular types of owl-vessels. There are indications that the birds on the ritual bronzes formerly possessed a greater importance than they have on the late Shang vessels. In the first place, all four types are so stylised that the species can only be conjectured, which is evidence of antiquity; the birds, in fact, are more conventionalised than any other animal on the bronzes. In the second place, they are not placed in important positions; usually they appear in bands on the upper parts, which suggests that they are ancient motifs relegated, as is often the case, to borders to make way for new conceptions. Birds had an ancient connection with the spirit-world. Erkes has noted that animal-forms of gods appear in the early Chinese cha- racters. "The ancient characters, which represent supernatural beings, may be looked on as forerunners, if not as beginnings, of the pictorial representations of such". Erkes cites ch/e, a mountain spirit, which is similar to kcui, a large bird (Erkes, Idols). There are many mountain-bird-deities in the Shan-hai-king. The majority have birds' bodies and human heads (De Rosny, Chan-hai-king, pp. 199, 254); some of these appear -on the Wu Liang bas- reliefs; others have birds' bodies and dragons' heads (p. 17), or birds' heads and dragons' bodies (p. 27). The relation of the gods to early script has also been noted in Elam: "At the same time the birds and animals as well as the geometric symbols are the forerunners of divine or magic signs later engraved upon seals and sometimes eventually converted into elements of writing" (Childe, New Light, p. 236). Various supernatural powers of the birds are indicated. The wind-deity is depicted on the oracle bones as a bird with a triangular crest and long drooping feathers. The crest, accord- ing to the late Dr. Britton, may not be a true crest, but a "sign of honor". The wind-deity does not resemble the birds on the bronzes. Besides the mountains and the wind, the birds were spirits of lakes and rivers; (1 faut un seul changement de melodie pour appeler les especes emplumees; c'est ainsi qu'on se met en rapport avec les esprits des lacs et rivieres) (Chou Li, XXII, i8). The birds' ability to prophesy is implied in the following passage: ~Condamnes de 1' Est) (Ils sont attaches au service des pitres. Ils nourrissent les boeufs, les chevaux, et sont</page><page sequence="92">EIGHTY-FOUR charges de parler avec les oiseaux) (Chou Li, XXXVII, 13). The eCondamnes) of the Northeast were charged to converse with animals; Comm. C says that the people of the North and the East knew the languages of animals and birds. There are very few instances of bird-sacrifice shown on the oracle bones (Creel, Birth of China, p. 200). Nor are there many material remains. Bird-sacrifices became frequent only in the Chou Dynasty, when there was an Officer of Cocks, who presented red cocks to be sacrificed to the ancestors, or at other Yang sacrifices, and black cocks for the spirits of the land and grain, and other Yin sacrifices (Chou Li, I, XX, p. 470). Turtle-doves were offered in sacrifice to old officers of the Court (op. cit., II, XXX, p. 211); and the eggs of certain birds were offered (II, XXX, p. 212). In some rites a cock-vase and a bird-vase, which Comm. B. says represented a f6ng-huang, were used (I, XX, p. 472). It may be taken for granted that the birds on the Shang vessels do not represent sacrificial birds. The probability is that the earliest animals on the bronzes originally had a genetic connection. Birds represent the souls of ancestors in a symbolic poem of the Shi King where only the impersonators of the dead, the happiness of the ancestral spirits, and wild ducks, are mentioned (Shi King, III, II, IV). One argument in favor of the bird-ancestor theory is that the Shang kings believed that they were descended from the swallow. The belief is evidently ancient, as there are various stories concerning the swallow-origin. L egge gives two: K~en-teih, daughter of the House of Sung, married the Emperor K'uh, and went with him at the vernal equinox, when the swallow makes his first appearance, to sacrifice and pray to the First Matchmaker. Seeh, her son, was born from a mystic union with the swallow. Legge doubts this sacrifice to the First Matchmaker (op. cit., IV, III, III, p. 466). Sse-ma T'sien's story seems more ancient. K~en-teih was bathing in a pool when a swallow appeared and laid an egg, which she ate, and from this came the birth of Seeh, founder of the Shang Dynasty. In the Shang Odes of Sung, which Creel has shown to be centuries later than the Shang Dynasty, though containing Shang material, the legend persists. Heaven . commissioned the swallow To descend and give birth to Shang". (Creel, Studies, p. 5i) Two ritual wine-vessels, Chio, both in the Metropolitan Museum, have covers formed like swallows. One is illustrated in ECSL VS, P1. 76; the other is illustrated in this study (PI. XV). They are very similar, but not identical. The one on PI. XV is inscribed with the name of an ancestor, "Father Chi", in whose honor the Chjo was made. The other is inscribed with the ya-hing. The ancestral souls were clearly conceived by the Chinese. As with many other peoples, the original idea of the soul which remained underground persisted, though they also believed in a soul which went to Heaven. The combination presented no difficulty because</page><page sequence="93">EIGHTY-FIVE of their belief in the connection between Heaven, Earth and Man. Man partakes of the nature of both; Earth gives him his body and his terrestrial soul; his celestial soul comes from Heaven. In the living person the terrestrial soul is called po'h, and the celestial soul hwun. After death they are called kwei, and shen. The Li Ki states the difference between them: "The intelligent spirit returns to Heaven; the body and animal soul return to earth" (IX, III, 17). "All the living must die, and dying return to the ground; this is what is called kwei. The bones and flesh moulder below, and, hidden away, become the earth of the fields. But the spirit issues forth, and is displayed on high in a condition of glorious brightness" (XXI, II, i). The souls do not go to Heaven and Earth; they return there; they complete a cycle. The dead were regarded as "spiritual intelligences" (Li Ki, I, p. 148). It is to the celestial soul that prayers are addressed, and the burnt offerings mingled with fragrant southern- wood made. Offerings to the terrestrial soul are more materialistic than scented smoke; they consist of millet, rice, and other foods (op. cit., XXI, II, 3). A connection between the bird and the soul appears in the ancient rite of calling back the soul, a ceremony which is evidently derived from the conception of the celestial soul being a bird: "The Calling Back" "A man is sent to call the soul back. He uses the clothes of the russet cap suit for the purpose, sewing the skirt to the coat. Then throwing them over his left shoulder, he takes the collar and the girdle together in his left hand. He then ascends by a ladder set against the front end of the east wall, and going up to the centre of the house faces north, and uses the clothes to invite the spirit to return to them, saying, 'Ah, so-and-so, return!' This he does three times, and then throws the clothes down in front of the wall. The clothes are received in a basket, and taken up by the east steps for the clothing of the corpse" (I Li, XXVI, II, p. 45). "The man who calls the soul to come back uses the deceased's dress clothes for the purpose. He takes the collar of the coat in his left hand and the waist in his right. As he calls, he moves his hands from the right side to the left" (op. cit., XXI, II, p. 95). This may have been meant to represent the motion of flying. The man faced the north because that was the dark region of disembodied spirits. Another early book, the Li Ki, has numerous references to the calling back of the soul (Li Ki, I, pps. io8, 112, 129, 157, 167, 340, 368-9; II, pps. 132, 136,143,174-5). One of these states specifically that the garment thrown from the roof was not used for dressing or for covering the dead (op. cit., p. 175). In this case the I Li, as the older book, undoubtedly describes the earlier custom. In ECSL VS, p. 125, the writer tentatively attempted to identify the four types of birds which repeatedly occur on the bronzes. Type I, with a curving crest and long flowing tail,</page><page sequence="94">EIGHTY-SIX may have represented the wind-deity or the feng-huang; this opinion the writer no longer holds as to the wind-deity; Type II is a bird of prey; Type III is a larger bird of prey and, judging by its upright pose, may be derived from the eagle. Types II and III may also represent the hawk, falcon, or osprey. Type IV, the only crestless bird, may be a duck or a dove, or perhaps a chicken. It has been seen that the bird had some symbolic importance for the Black Pottery people, since it is the only animal appearing on their pottery. It may be advantageous to examine the attitude of the Tungus toward birds. The lapse in time is great, but religious practices in primitive races tend to be conservative. To the Tungus, the birds represented the heavenly upper world of the sky. Their name for the Milky Way was "the Birds' Way". When the Shaman wished to communicate with the lower world he impersonated a deer; when he communicated with the spirits of the upper world, he impersonated a bird. His head-dress was of particular importance. It had a hooked ornament with a brass mirror in front, and fringes hung down, covering the Shaman's face (Nioradze, Der Schamanismus). The head-dress of the northern Tungus Shaman has a brass frame-work on which one, three, or more birds are fastened. Shiro- kogoroff says these birds have "small heads, heavy bodies, small wings, and very long, rich tails". He considers that they may be peacocks. He also notes a "symbolised falcon" and pigeons. The birds on the head-dress sometimes revolve (Shirokogoroff, Psychomental Complex, p. 295). This element of revolving birds is found in widely separated places. The Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia have a ceremonial dance-mask, showing an eagle's beak and eyes above a human mouth. On the head is an ornament with four curved arms tipped with feathers, "which can be whirled by means of a ground disk and a cord operated by the dancer" (Davis, Native Arts, p. 133). The four arms suggest the winds of the four directions. Also in the Western Hemisphere is the ceremony of the Volador, still performed in certain parts of Mexico. A very tall pole is erected with a small platform on the top of which a man dances. Four ropes are suspended from the top, and four men, attached to these, revolve around the pole. In former days they wore plumage and large wings. Each one corresponds to a cardinal point and may represent the sacred bird governing thirteen years of the cycle of the calendar; "Birds which dominate the winds" (Larsen, Notes on the Volador). In both these cases of the Western Hemisphere, the motion is primarily associated with the four winds, which are gods for many of the North American Indians. Birds revolving on a pivot are used in Greece and Macedonia, at the present time in spring, the birds being swallows, the messengers of spring. Frazer says, "The meaning of these revolutions is obscure" (Frazer, Spirits, II, p. 322). It seems probable that the revolut- ions in every case symbolise the motion of the real bird in the air. The Shaman's spirit is. believed actually to fly, accompanied by his attendant spirit-birds.</page><page sequence="95">EIGHTY-SEVEN All Shaman wear birds or birds' feathers on the official costume for communicating with the upper world. The Yakut Shaman wears a head-dress with the complete iron skeleton of a bird. The Goldi Shaman wears a head-dress with a small iron cuckoo. The Buriat Shaman wears small iron figures of single- and double-headed birds; his shoes have iron claws (Klemente, Buriats). The Yenesei Shaman wears metal pendants in the form of small birds, swans and eagles. The Tungus and the Yenesei Shaman are the only ones who wear coats cut in the back to resemble the tail of a bird, undoubtedly the eagle, as the power of the Shaman comes from the eagle. This coat is not closed in the front, and all the ornaments are on the back (Nioradze, op.cit.). This is no doubt because the coat represented the wings of the bird, which do not meet in front, as well as the tail. The birds worn by the Tungus Shaman, according to Shirokogoroff, are the peacock, falcon, and pigeon. His description of the first is more applicable to the pheasant than to the peacock, in the writer's opinion; moreover, there are pheasants in northern Asia, but no peacocks. Birds of Type I on the bronzes could be derived from the pheasant, but hardly from the peacock, as the tails are too dissimilar. Birds of Type II could be derived from the raven, which is considered by the Tungus to have the gift of prophesy, and to bring good luck in hunting. Bird III might be derived from the falcon, or the eagle; Bird IV from the pigeon. There is nothing definitive here, but neither is there anything contradictory. Apparently none of the birds on the Shang vessels represent the swallow; if one does, it has become stylised beyond recognition. The swallows on the two Chio are definitely re- cognisable; the small jade swallows are also somewhat naturalistically treated, with their short beaks and forked tails (ECSL VS, Frontispiece). The birds on the bronzes evidently represent a higher antiquity than either the swallows or the owls so far discovered. The Owl is so much less stylised than the preceding four types of birds that its character- istics can always be recognised. Unlike other birds, it is usually covered with an animal- decor which makes it practically a composite creature. Since the Owl is a composite animal, it may be interpreted as being a guardian of the ancestral spirits of the Shang rulers. This is entirely compatible with the early significance of owls, and in accord with the Tungus belief that the owl destroys evil spirits and is generally protective. There seems also to be some obscure connection between the Shang rulers of An-yang and the Owl. The ode to "The Owl" in the Shi King (Couvreur, Cheu King, XV, II), traditionally attributed to the Duke of Chou, is, in Couvreur's opinion, addressed to Wu-keng, son of the last Shang ruler. It was evidently considered an important ode, as it is also mentioned in the Shu King (Legge, Shu King, V, VI, 2). Granet thinks that the ode applies to the inauguration of the new dynasty: the Chou having conquered the Shang, also take over their emblem (Granet, IDanses et Le'gendes, II, p. 548, n. 2). A connection with the Shang kings would explain why the Owls, even when treated more or less naturalistically, are covered with animal-decor;</page><page sequence="96">EIGHTY-EIGHT the Shang rulers placed the ancestral symbols on their own particular emblem for greater protection. The owl later acquires a sinister aspect; it kills its mother; yet it is said, ((Dans l'antiquite, les hommes mangeaient souvent la chair de cet oiseau)) (Chan-hai-king, II, 17, note from Wa-kan San-sai-dut-ye, t. XLIV, p. 12). Certainly when the owl was eaten it was not considered an unfilial and impious bird. The eating may have been a ritual act. According to Granet, the owl was the bird of lightning; it was also associated with thunder, with the drum, which it invented, with the forge, with metal. It was apparently, he says, the emblem of a royal clan of blacksmiths (Granet, op. cit., II, 5 1 6, seq.). Something of its former prestige and power lasts at least into the Han Dynasty, when ornaments called the "owl-corner", or the "owl's tail", were placed at the angles of roofs to guard the buildings against fire (Granet, op. cit., p. 53 ). Owls were also placed at the tops of columns supporting roofs (Chavannes, Mission, Texte, I, P.76-77, Fig. 45; p. 121, Fig. 73). This may be an example of Han returning to the ideas of an earlier period. A white marble Owl found at An-yang has ram's horns lying flat on its head, a horned head adorns its breast; the wings are outlined by tiger-headed snakes; the legs are incised with similar snakes (Pelliot, op. cit., Fig. i8). The double-owl Yu retain the head with the flat ram's horns, and may have bodies either with no ornament or with a most elaborate decor. The single-owl Tsun have the snake-edged wings, and the horned head on the breast, but the owls' heads are more naturalistically treated, sometimes with characteristic tufted ears. Salmony has proved that the elongated upturned tips on the feet of Early Chou owls, like those in the collections of Mrs. William H. Moore and Baron Sumitomo, which give the effect of Turkish slippers, are the tails of the snake, which, originally incised on the owl's legs, has gradually risen into high relief, after the manner of horns and other elements on Early Chou bronzes, and finally has become partly detached from the vessel (Salmony, A Problem in the Iconography). One may speculate as to whether the marble Owl and the single-owl Tsun may have a Tungusic origin. The Tungus believe in the divine protectiveness of the Owl, and stuffed owls are kept to ward off evil influences. The single images of the owls, which differ from the other ritual vessels, may have been inspired by these. The Tungus Shaman wears owls" feathers and eagles' feathers in his ceremonial head-dress; small jade images of conventiona- lised owls and eagles exist in Shang. In China only the symbolic birds appear on the ritual vessels; on the oracle bones the wind-deity is completely a bird. There is no anthropomorphised bird-deity in the official religion, unlike the cases of Egypt and other countries. With the Chou conquest the decor of the bronzes changes; it becomes exaggerated embellishment; the birds expand and become more ornate. It is difficult to interpret symbolism in Early Chou, as the ritual vessels so soon take the path later taken by the totem-poles of Alaska, and, from being sacred vessels</page><page sequence="97">EIGHTY-NINE in Shang, become merely "proclamations of prestige" (Stirling, op. cit.) for their possessors in Chou. There is no case known to the writer of an anthropomorphised bird-deity on any early ritual bronze. EARLY CHOU The cult of the Bird-deities, then, existed outside of the official religion. It may have been Tungusic in origin; it is undoubtedly older than the first evidences so far known, which are found in Early Chou. Its extraordinary duration from that time through the period of the Six Dynasties is proof of the great appeal of the conception for the imaginat- ion for the Chinese. The Bird-deity usually appears with a human head and a bird's body, or with a human -head and body with bird attributes. This is typical of all deities in China when there is a blending of human- and animal-forms. The human body with the animal head, so character- istic of Egyptian religion, is not typical of Chinese thought, and the instances in which this particular blending occurs may usually be traced to foreign influences, as, for example, the late zodiacal figures with animal heads, which were introduced by a Turkic tribe. Among the many mountain-deities of the Shan-hai-king, all have human heads on animal-bodies, with the exception of a very few instances in which the heads are always those of a bird, a snake, or a dragon. The earliest images of bird-deities all conform to the Chinese type. These earliest images are all small jade talismans or amulets. The oldest is the figure in the Chicago Natural History Museum (PI. XVI). Small as it is, it is a work of great power, with the monumental quality characteristic of even the smallest piece of Chinese sculpture. The jade is greenish white; the talisman is smooth and compact; the carving is done simply, austerely, and with great assurance. The smoothness and absence of angles suggest an amulet which could be easily carried in the hand. The deity has a human head, a bird's body, wings, legs and feet. There are no arms. The head is primitive in type, and disproportionately large in relation to the upright bird-body. The large eyes are typical "Shang" eyes; the eyebrows are in relief; the nose is perfectly flat, and excessively broad at the nostrils; the upper lip, the only one shown, is unhumanly wide; the ears are very large. The hair, neat as a hood, is formed by striated lines; on the top of the head is an odd protuberance, which may be a cap. On the back, below the edge of the hair, is a rectangular form enclosing an oval. The wings and the tail lie flat and close; the powerful legs and the feet, with large claws, are definitely those of a bird of prey. The upright pose suggests an owl, a falcon or an eagle. More elegant and less forceful is a white jade Bird-deity in the Freer Gallery (PI. XVIIa). This figure has a far less primitive face; a complete mouth with parted lips, rectangular eyes, and square ears. Flanges project from the striated hair which rises vertically from the head. 12</page><page sequence="98">NINETY The figure has arms with two clawed hands, and directly below the arms, as though they were connected, are the wings. This connection will appear again centuries later. The legs and feet resemble those on certain of the early jade birds. Below the feet there is an extension, which is puzzling, as the hair is pierced by a hole so that the talisman could be worn. The curved pose of the figure may have been intended to suggest an upward flight. A third jade Bird-deity, belonging to Mr. C. T. Loo, differs from both the preceding ones. This figure has a strange sub-human face, with oval eyes, slanting slightly upward, no nose whatever, and a very wide mouth. The striated hair rises vertically, turns back, rises to a point, and then falls to the ears, which are large and outlined by oval lines. The short arms end in thick three-fingered hands; the wings rise high on the chest and curve under the hands. The legs and feet are human, but are bent inward in a curiously distorted position producing a deformed appearance (P1. XVIII). These three Bird-deities are all pierced to be worn as amulets; the first through the wings, slightly below the center of the body; the second through the striated hair; the holes in the third are in the feet. Another feature which they have in common is that of having no necks; the heads rest immediately on the shoulders. A fourth jade Bird-deity, in the Winthrop Collection at the Fogg Museum, seems at first sight to have little in common with these three talismans, but examination shows that it is part of the same tradition as that of the earliest example on Plate XVI. The face of the Fogg Museum deity is primitive in type, with small eyes, eyebrows in relief, a broad flat nose, wide mouth, and enormous ears, of which only the outer rims remain. The striated hair is treated much like that of the Chicago Natural History Museum deity, but in this case it ends in a curl at the back of the neck. On this head there is also a protuberance, which, however, has a hole at the top as though something had originally fitted into it. The raised rectangle appears here, but on the breast instead of on the back, with a circle rather than an oval in the center. Below the rectangle on the breast is a tiger's head with ram's horns, in the style of Early Chou. This figure has a neck, but practically no shoulders. Two birds extend from the figure as though they were arms, with the heads in place of hands. Their hooked beaks are derived from those of the Shang birds of prey. In silhouette they suggest the neolithic posture. On the back there are three round protuberances on either side of the neck, and beneath them a partly detached disk with a rimmed, rounded hollow in the center (PI. XVII, b). MIDDLE CHOU So far the Middle Chou period has disclosed only one Bird-deity, which is in the Winthrop Collection at the Fogg Museum. It is made of bronze, with a gold inlay. It has a human head on a bird's body, wings, no arms, and so far resembles the oldest bird-deity at the</page><page sequence="99">NINETY-ONE Chicago Natural History Museum. Unfortunately the bronze is so badly corroded that it is impossible to discover whether or not there are details which might connect it with one or more of the preceding deities. Its general effect is entirely different; it lacks the fantastic element which the others possess; it has none of the convincing quality of belonging to the other-world which is so marked in the oldest talisman; it does not at all suggest the super- natural, but seems merely ornamental and secular. The head is not Chinese in any particular; it has a feminine, rather trivial appearance. The eyes are small and narrow; the nose is very prominent; the ears are set high on the head; the mouth is narrow and the chin small. Cor- rosion prevents one from seeing whether the hair is represented by striated lines. There is apparently a hole on the top of the head. There may be the remnant of a flange on the head, or it may merely be the result of corrosion. The figure has a neck, which is encircled at the base by a band of gold, and remains of gold inlay appear on the chest and back. The wings are inlaid with long strips of gold and turquoises. There seem to be traces of a design on the edges of one wing; it might be the tiger-headed snake, but it is impossible to be certain. The wings are long, and meet over the tail, which is badly corroded, but inlaid gold feathers can be seen at one side. Two deep, long incisions on the back are evidently feathers which have lost the inlay. The right leg has been broken off; the left one is twisted and corroded; they are apparently birds' legs. Two snakes are intertwined between them. The base beneath the snakes is corroded bronze. It cannot be seen whether the Bird-deity's feet originally touched the ground at the level of the tip of the tail, or whether, as seems to be the case, they rested on some object which also supported the snakes (P1. XIX a). LATE CHOU One of the innovations in the period of Late Chou is the appearance of several Bird- deities with human bodies and the heads of birds. In Mr. Erickson's collection are three most interesting and varied bird-deities from Chang-sha, small bronze figures in the round, one of which is of this type (P1. XXI). It is a column-like figure in bronze whose beautiful pale blue-green patina is enhanced by a gold and silver inlay. The disproportionately large head is that of a bird of prey, probably an eagle, with a great curved hooked beak. The eyes are not entirely bird-like, and the heavy striated eyebrows are human. Long feathers on the head fall below the shoulders and curl upwards. A hollow cylinder, perforated on opposite sides, rests on the head. The arms, held close to the sides, are bent at the elbows and raised to the head where they end in three great claws encircling large non-human ears. There are no wings. A close-fitting garment, charmingly decorated by the gold inlay, ends at the back in a form resembling the tail of a bird. This is reminiscent of the ceremonial coats of the Tungus and the Yenesei Shaman, and, like theirs, this coat also does not meet</page><page sequence="100">NINETY-TWO in the front. The body and legs are human; the feet are missing; they seem to have been broken off, so that it cannot be seen whether or not they ended in claws. The second figure is human (P1. XIX b and XX). It is sitting on its heels, supported by a short pole rising from a base. The face is primitive, and the features are not in any way Chinese. The eyes are small; the heavy eyebrows are similar to those on the preceding deity; a lump of corrosion hides the original shape of the nose; the upper lip is excessively long; the chin is short. On the face are incised a sparse mustache sweeping upward to the cheek-bones, and a beard. The ears are corroded. The artificial regularity of the edges of the hair and the baldness of the head at the back suggest a shaven head and a wig. The hair is long, and extends outward from the head in back. On the head is a small structure which resembles the base of a pedestal and which fits on the head by means of a sort of half-cap. One pair of wings hang from the backs of the shoulders; the coiled spiral at the top of these wings is a cloud-symbol. Another pair of wings lie on the flanks; and there seem to be feathers on the chest. The hands rest on the knees. This figure may have been part of a lamp. Karlgren illustrates a bronze which is somewhat similar (Karigren, Some Bronzes, P. 40,1). Here the figure is seated on a base; from its head rises the stem of the lamp, with a dragon coiling around it, and holding the stem in his mouth. On top is a plain, round lamp which is detachable. Karigren says tentatively that the figure has "a bear's (?) head", but though the illustration does not show the head clearly, it can be seen that the figure is clothed in feathers and wings, like the Erickson deity, and is seated in much the same posture. The dragon coiled around the stem, in the writer's opinion, resembles a snake more than a dragon. The third of Mr. Erickson's Bird-deities is even more enigmatic than the others (PI. XXII). This figure is seated in much the same pose as the second image, but it is without legs. It is apparently a human being with a bird's head, but close inspection reveals that it is a human being wearing a bird-mask, which covers the face and the upper part of the head like a sort of helmet. The human mouth may be seen below the bird's beak. The eyes are human but they seem to be part of the mask. This figure also has a mustache and beard. The bird-mask covers the face to the mouth; it fits over the ears, rises behind them, and then extends in a long rounded point to the nape of the neck. Feathers appear on the lower part of the mask, but the upper part, which rises like a high cap with a rounded peak, is entirely undecorated. This figure is reposeful; it has none of the action expressed in the second figure. The body is flat and thin; it is wrapped in a close-fitting cape-like garment made of feathers, beneath which the arms and the hands resting on the knees can be discerned. There is the effect of a wide girdle in the front. Wings are incised on the back, and either wings or tail-feathers lie on the sides. The cape spreads out like a skirt; the figure is hollow, and seems to have fitted over some object which is missing. This Bird-deity could</page><page sequence="101">NINETY-THREE not have been part of a lamp; it is difficult to imagine that it had any utilitarian function. The bird-mask covering all the face to the mouth is similar to the eagle-mask of the Kwakiutl Indians. This type is derived from the prehistoric belief in the identity of man and animal. This is illustrated in a Kwakiutl legend about the Seagull-ancestor; Grey Seagull "desired to have what was a pretty beach and he took off his bird-mask and became a man" (Boas, Ethnology of the Kwvakiutl, II, p. 938-9); and also in the description of the Kwakiutl winter dance: "... these people sitting on the floor of the great winter dancing-house were the souls of the trees and bushes, and the souls of all the birds and of small creeping animals, for they are all human beings" (op. cit., II, p. 1220). The belief exists in many races, among them the Eskimos of Bering Strait who believe that all beings originally had a dual existence and could become man or animal as they desired. When an animal or a bird wanted to assume a human form, it pushed up its muzzle with its paw, or its beak with its wing, as though it were raising a mask beneath which there was a human being. This form re- presented the thinking part of the animal or bird, and was its shade after death. The Shaman had the power of seeing through the animal-mask to the human being beneath. (Frazer, Scapegoat, p.380, quoting Nelson, i8th Annual Report, Bureau of American Ethnology). It is possible that some of the many instances in which a human head appears in an animal's mouth may be connected with this belief. Among the Bird-deities so far described there are no duplicates; each figure is a unique expression of the general idea. The differences in the figures may be due, or partly due, to the various localities of their origin. The significance of the Bird-deity images seems, in the writer's opinion, to vary at different periods, that is to say, it varies in the matter of emphasis within the general conception. The birds on the ritual bronzes are probably connected with the ancestral spirits; the jade talismans are protective; the images of Middle Chou and Chang-sha suggest guardian household gods. It is of course possible that there is always some connection with the ancestral spirits. So far, the blended deities have been represented in quiet, reposeful postures, with little suggestion of action. There is now a change from the static to the dynamic, and also a change from representations in the round to representat- ions on a flat surface. Two new varieties of Bird-deities appear on several Hu of the Huai Valley culture, and are also found on a painted mirror. These Hu have a generally similar pattern of designs separated into panels within horizontal registers around the vessel. Various differences in arrangement and detail occur on the different Hu. On the Hu in the collection of M. David-Weill, birds occupy the highest register, below which is a repeated hunting-scene of men with bows and arrows and animals which are apparently leopards. In the register beneath there is the repeated design of a bird-deity with a human body and the head of a bird of prey. The deity's back is turned to the</page><page sequence="102">NINETY-FOUR spectator, and the stongly beaked head is seen in profile. The figure, which is apparently dancing, has long narrow wings, no arms, a bird's body and tail, human legs, and large predatory claws instead of feet. On either side of it is a bird with long drooping wings and tail, and a one-legged reptilian form. On the lower register is a different type of bird-deity. This figure has a human head and body and faces the spectator. It wears a head-dress of short, wide, outstretched wings; the face and nose are broad. Long narrow wings rise almost from the shoulders. The body is either a bird's' or is clad in a garment of feathers. Here, too, there are large claws instead of feet, and the deity is apparently performing some sort of dance. On either side of this full-faced deity is a two-legged reptilian form with a drooping bird above it (Janse, RAA, VIII, III). The Hu belonging to Mr. Brundage shows on the upper register, below the neck, a man attacking a speared leopard; directly below are two men attacking a stag with large antlers; a wide band of geometric design separates this scene from one in which two men with bow and arrow, spear, and apparently a sword, are attacking a wild bull. Below this is a group of two figures: one has a human body, legs which have projections on the calves but are otherwise human, human feet, and a somewhat deer-like head, with a long, sharply-pointed ear, but no antlers. There is a suggestion that this figure may be that of a woman. It holds a bow and is apparently aiming an arrow across two small writhing dragons at a bird-headed deity which is of the same type as that on the David-Weill Hu. This Bird-deity, also with its back turned and its head seen in profile, has a large beak, a very large round eye, and an ear-like crest. It has long, outstretched wings; arms, ending in two claws, rise from beneath the shoulders and lie along the upper part of the wings as though part of them, recalling the arms and wings of the Early Chou jade Bird-deity in the Freer Gallery (P1. XVIIa). A large swirling tail covers the body; the legs,-except for projections on the calves,-and the feet are human. The pose is full of action; the deity is perhaps dancing, or about to fly (PI. XXIIIa). Below this scene, in the lowest register, is the full-faced Bird-deity. The large face has oval eyes, a very wide nose, and an oval mouth which gives the effect of the tongue protruding or showing. The ears are enormous. The object on the head which Karlgren has called horns is a writhing snake with an eared feline head. The deity's arms merge into wide rectangular wings on the lower corner of which are great claws. The body is feathered, and there is a bird's tail. The legs, with no projections, and the feet are human. On either side of the deity is a large affronted bird of the heron or crane type about to devour a tiger-headed snake (P1. XXIII, b). A different arrangement of registers occurs on a Hu belonging to the Chinese Government (Karlgren, The Date, P1. 17, 2). The full-faced Bird-deity appears on the highest register below the neck of the vase instead of on the lowest register. It has, like the former deities a wide face, with broad nose, and very large ears. The eyes are more round than oval. The</page><page sequence="103">NINETY-FIVE snake again appears on the head; in this case the snake's head is on the deity's right; on the Brundage Hu it was on the left. The arms again merge into upraised rectangular wings with a very long claw on each. The tail, or wing, is shorter than in the previous case. The legs and feet are human. Across the left leg lies a tiger-headed snake with prominent ears. On either side of the deity is a large crested bird, affronted, and treading on a tiger-headed snake. In the register below is a scene with a hunter, a speared leopard, and a reclining deer. Directly beneath this, two hunters are attacking a wild bull which has an erect stylised mane all along its spine. A band of geometric pattern follows, and below that is the scene with the Bird-headed-deity. The deer-headed deity here has a long rounded Gear, perhaps two ears, and a small conical horn. The skirt-like garment is longer in this instance; the legs and feet are human. The arrow is again aimed at the Bird-deity, which is again separated from the deer-headed figure by two small stylised dragons. The Bird- deity has a large, very much hooked beak, a great round eye and an ear-like crest. Its extended wings end in short poles. The arms, tipped with claws, which lay along the wings of the Early Chou jade deity and the deity on the Brundage Hu, here rise from the back below the shoulders, and project into the air, ending in two claws. The wings and tail swirl above the human legs which end in birds' feet with large claws. This same scene occurs on a painted mirror in the collection of Dr. Franco Vannotti. The two figures resemble the deities on the Chinese Government Hu more than those on the other Hu. The deer-headed figure has the long rounded ear, and in this case two short upright horns. The legs and feet are human. The Bird-headed deity has the downward- curved hooked beak, the ear-like crest, the two long arms with the claws rising from the back. The tail is similar, and the feet are clawed. The wings are similar as far as can be seen, but the paint is damaged, and the pole-ends, if present, are not visible. A variation is the position of the dragons (P1. XXIV). The symbolic meaning of these Bird-deities on the Huai Hu and the mirror can only be conjectured. Salmony has suggested a southern origin for the full-faced deity, which has no prototype in China. Certainly most of the snake-deities seem to be in southern countries. In India the favorite goddess of Dravidian tribes in central and western Bengal is a snake- goddess wearing a tiara of snakes and holding a cobra in each hand (Crooke, Bagdi). The snake-goddess of Crete also wears and holds serpents. The Mayan goddess Ixchel, who has clawed hands and feet, wears a writhing snake on her head in her destructive aspect, and a coiled snake in her more benevolent aspect (Morley, Ancient Maya, Fig. 9, p. 29). It may be noted that all these snake-deities are women. Karlgren mentions Ordos influence in regard to the scene with the deer-headed and the bird-headed figures, but says that the bird-men and cervid-men there do not furnish any analogous religious ideas (Karigren, The Date, etc., P. 19). After considering these opinions</page><page sequence="104">NINETY-SIX and studying the material, the writer is unable to agree with these authorities, and concludes that the full-faced deity is probably of Chinese origin, and that the Bird-headed deity has a northern origin, for the following reasons: An analysis of the full-faced deities shows that most of the elements composing them are Chinese. The wide face, broad nose, enormous ears, and absence of neck are characteristic of the Early Chou talismans. The wings, the bird-body, and the absence of arms are also characteristic of the early images. The snake may be one of the Shang revivals of which so many occurred in the Huai period. The importance of the snake on the early ritual vessels has perhaps not been sufficiently stressed. There are also snakes with the Middle Chou deity (P1. XIX a). Here the snake appears as though seen from above, as it does on the Shang bronzes. On the head it lies in the position of the crooked horns which, according to the writer, are those of the Bull sacrificed to the spirits of the Land and Grain. It is more curved than the Shang snake; it has an eared feline head. The human legs and feet have appeared in the case of one of the Early Chou jade deities (P1. XVIII). The wings have been present on all the Bird-deities, either as part of the body, as wings, or as a feather-garment. The writer can find no elements which are non-Chinese. This full-faced deity also appears on a different type of vessel where the only other creatures of the decor are birds of various kinds (Pls. XXV, XXVI). It wears the snake, whose head is here apparently a true snake's head; it has long rectangular wings with claws, a bird's body and human legs and feet. On either side is a large bird, with long legs and a hooked beak. On the base of the vessel, the legs of the Bird-deities are omitted, and the feathered bodies are shortened to fit the space, so that they present an extraordinary effect of birds with huge human heads and curious wings rising from an S-shaped element, which is the way the arms with two claws appear here. The Bird-deities are separated by pairs of confronted birds so arranged that they give the impression of being double-headed birds (P1. XXVI). The writer suggests that the scene with the deer-headed and the bird-headed figures shows some ceremony involving a Shaman impersonating a deer, which represents the lower world, and a Shaman impersonating a bird which represents the upper world. The bow and arrow may signify a contest, or it may be merely an attribute of the lower-world deer. It is possible too that the impersonated deities are depicted for auspicious reasons, and that no ceremony is involved. The fact that the Bird-headed deity on the Huai Hu always has his back turned to the spectator may be explained by the Shaman's ritual costume; the coat of the Tungus Shaman, as has been said, was shaped like an eagle's tail, did not meet in front, and had all the ornaments on the back. It would be natural, therefore, to select this attitude for representation. The wing on the full-faced Bird-deity is also placed as though it were seen from the back. The dancing attitudes of both types of deity, particularly noticeable on the Chinese Government IHlu also suggest a northern origin, as the dance of</page><page sequence="105">NINETY-SEVEN the Shaman, in preparation for the departure of his spirit to the upper or to the lower world, is full of action, sometimes amounting to frenzy. As for the Bird-headed deity's head, one may speculate as to whether the Shaman's bird-head-dress and mask of fringe may not have developed from a bird-mask, which, in the 4th century B. C., perhaps resembled somewhat the eagle-mask, already mentioned, of the Kwakiutl Indians. It is this bird-headed Huai deity that Karlgren connects with, and apparently believes to be the source of, the bird-costumed people on the bronze drums of Dong-so'n in Tongking (Karlgren, The Date etc., p. i8). A connection between China and the Dong-so'n culture has been recognised for some time. Goloubew, in 1929, pointed out that the decor on the drums contained Chinese elements, which he attributed to the Han period (Goloubew, L'Age du Bronze). Since then several scholars have shown that the Chinese elements are earlier than Han. Heine-Geldern, in 1934, stated that the 'designs were related to the Late Chou style, and concluded that the Dong-so'n culture could not have begun later than circa 3oo B. C., and probably had begun earlier (Heine-Geldern, Vorgeschichtliche Grundlagen der kolonialindischen Kunst, Wiener Beitrige zur Kunst und Kulturgeschichte Asiens). In another article he states that the miniature replicas of bronze drums found in the Dong-so'n graves indicate that the large drums must have been known and used for probably centuries before (Heine-Geldern, Bedeutung und Herkunft der dltesten hinterindi- schen Metalltrommeln, Asia Major, Vol. 8). Janse considers that some of the types of weapons found at Dong-so'n also appear in YUnnan, or elsewhere in China (Janse, Un Groupe, etc.); Steinmann, in 1937, says that certain Sumatran textiles confirm Heine-Geldern's theory of a Dong-so'n culture which included South Sumatra, and states that Chinese influences of both the Chou and the Ts'in styles are present (Steinmann, Les Tissus, etc.). Karigren, in the article mentioned above, undertakes to prove that the greater part of the decor on the drums contains elements derived specifically from the Huai style in China. His analysis is entirely convincing for most of the elements; he begins with eleven "minor motifs" on the drums, then considers the principal scenes. For nine of the "minor motifs" the proof is con- clusive; in regard to the other two, and to the principal scenes, the writer cannot follow him. One of these two motifs is the central "motif" on the drums, which Karlgren calls a star, and says that it is "a very ancient Chinese motif". Perhaps the mother-of-pearl plaque from An-yang is the earliest example (KarIgren, op. cit., P1. 20. 4). This star, with its well-defined center encircled by a narrow band, and its eight petal-like points, suggests a flower-form. A six-pointed star with a center appears on a carved bone found at Anyang (Umehara, Selected Treasures, etc., PI. LXXXIII, i). Another six-pointed star with a center is illustrated in Yeh Ching P'ien Yu, Vol. II, PI. 5). It suggests an Early Chou origin, as does also the star on the jingle-holder, which has a center and eight points (Karlgren, op. cit., P1. il, 8). So far as the writer knowls, the star does not appear on any of the Shang ritual bronzes. 13</page><page sequence="106">NINETY-EI GHT Judging by a pre-Han mirror, with the handle forming the center of an eight-pointed star (op. cit., P1. 12, 4) and by the illustrations in KarIgren's article "Huai and Han" the eight-pointed star was the most frequent form of star before the Han Dynasty. On the Han mirrors illustrated, the eight-pointed stars are still in the majority, there being eight examples of these (Huai and Han, PI. 65, 92 and 93; P1. 66, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99; P1. 67, 913) to four examples of all other stars (PI. 65, 91; 67, 910, 911 and 914). The pre-Han star, and the majority of Han stars, seem to be characterised by possessing a center and usually eight points. The stars on the early Dong-so'n drums do not resemble the Chinese stars in either of these particulars. They never have centers, nor eight points; they have twelve, fourteen, or sixteen long points which definitely suggest rays. One very late drum, which Karigren places in the Western Han period, has an eight pointed star, but it has no center (Karlgren, op. cit.). But are the Dong-so'n "stars" really stars? Do they not, with their long rays, rather suggest suns? The curious faces between the ends of the rays, seen most clearly on the Mu'o'ng and Ngoc-lu drums, have no Chinese prototype, so far as the writer knows (Karl- gren, op. cit., Pls. 1, 3). These faces look toward the center of the drum; they have round eyes, but no other features, and no foreheads; they are each divided by a median line, and end in arrow-shaped points; short lines, like rays, rise from the very low tops of their heads. They represent, in the writer's opinion, frogs; the similarity may be seen by comparing them with a frog in the round on the Saleier drum (op. cit., P1. 8). The high ridge in the frog's face corresponds to the median line of the faces between the rays. It seems probable to the writer that the stars represent suns; the frogs were supernaturally connected with rain; moreover, as ancestral spirits they guarded the ricefields. The associat- ion of sun and frog suggests a connection with fertility. One is reminded of the sun- worshipping Chibchas of Colombia, for whom the frog was a divinity (Markham, Andeans). The frog-faces persist, though altered on the later drums. On the Saleier drum, for instance they have dwindled, lost their eyes and changed their position; they are now squeezed in between the rays at their bases. The writer believes that both the frogs and the long-rayed suns are probably native symbols. The second "minor motif" for which the writer cannot see a Chinese origin is the birds. One wonders why Karlgren classifies them as a "minor motif ". Are they not rather a major motif, perhaps the major motif of the decor? Birds appear in concentric bands; on the boats; on or in the water; over the water; flying above people's heads; on the roofs of structures; on the eaves; in company with the deer; by themselves; people wear very high feather-head-dresses; some apparently wear bird-costumes; the boats have bird-prows and bird-sterns. On late drums birds outlast all other living forms except the frog. Karlgren sees a "most remarkable resemblance" between the birds on the Laos drum (op. *</page><page sequence="107">NINETY-NINE cit., PI. 5), and the birds on a pre-Han tile from the Lo-yang region (op. cit., PI. i6, 7). This resemblance is not apparent to the writer. The birds on the Laos drum are stiff and archaic, with clumsy heads, and it is not possible to define the species. The birds on the pre-Han tile are unmistakably wild geese, some rising to the flight, some already on the wing. Though merely simplified outlines, they are drawn with a flowing yet assured line. The great hunting-dog, too, stalking the deer with heavy stealthiness, is a linear triumph. To achieve such expressiveness with such economy of means indicates a power of observation and a command of technique which the creator of the birds on the Laos drum did not possess. In none of the birds on the drums can the writer detect any Chinese influence. It seems rather that their stylisation suggests an indigenous origin; their hacked-out angularity may imply a rather recently abandoned background of wood-carving. Concerning the land- and boat-scenes, Karigren says that he knows of "no counterpart to the Dong-so'n boat-scenes in the Huai style". He connects, however, the people in bird-costume with the bird-headed deities of the Huai Hu., and apparently believes that these Huai deities are the source of the bird-costumed people on the drums, in spite of their dissimilarities, which he notes. Bird-cults, as has been seen, are widely extended in time and space. The underlying conception, based on the collective unconscious, is everywhere the same originally; the expressions of that concept vary with different peoples. In the universality of bird-cults, it is hardly necessary to attribute a Chinese origin for the bird-cult in Dong-so'n; it seems more probable that these people, in their land of many birds, evolved it independently, as so many other peoples did elsewhere. In China, bird-deities after Shang are always composite beings, blendings of man and bird. On the Dong-so'n drums the people are human beings in ritual costume. Those on land wear very high feather-head-dresses, and wing-like skirts; they carry musical instruments and other objects, in some cases weapons. One figure on the top of the Ngoc-lu drum holds a long arrow-shaped spear with feathers on the shaft. The people seem to be engaged in a processional dance, or in walking with a ritual step. On the boats the figures wear even higher feather-head-dresses, often taller than the people themselves. These have feathers resembling peacock-feathers. The people on boats do not wear skirts; they carry axes, spears like that of the dancer on the land, and lances or darts. It seems probable that these are men and the figures on land are women. Evidently they are all participating in a ceremony for which they wear ritual costumes. There is no attempt at disguise, no such impersonation of a deity as is shown by the bird- headed Huai deity. It seems probable, in the writer's opinion, that they are honoring, not impersonating, a god. The manner of so doing connects them not with China, but with the islands of the Pacific.</page><page sequence="108">ONE HUNDRED Goloubew quotes Finot as saying that the bird-costumes have no analogy in Indo-China, but are found in certain oceanic islands, which neither he nor Goloubew names. One of these is New Guinea. At Hawa Bay, on the north side of the island, the natives every two or three years secretly make two head-dresses for sacred rites. These are made of feathers worked on bamboo frames, and are respectively nineteen and fourteen feet high. The dancers wearing them represent "local deities" (Chicago Natural History Museum photo- graphs). One photograph shows women dancing before these masked bird-men, which may imply a cult connected with fertility. The Monumbo, Papuans of New Guinea, have masked dances with masks representing the cassowary (Haddon, New Guinea); these cassowary masks represent guardian spirits and are addressed as though they were human beings (Crawley, Masks); this implies that they are ancestral spirits. In New Britain, New Ireland, and Duke of York Island, members of the powerful Duk-duk society wear head-dresses of feathers six feet high, representing the male and female cassowary (Crawley, op. cit.). Masks are principally confined to the Melanesians, and are not, according to Crawley, found further south than 9' north latitude. The tall feather-head-dresses also exist in the MWestern Hemni- sphere. In central Brazil the Chambioas keep red macaws in captivity, and use their feathers to make mask-head-dresses six feet high, which are worn in sacred dances. They are kept in special huts; women are not permitted to see them, under pain of death (Frazer, Spirits, IL, p. 208). The Kobeua and the Kaua Indians of northwestern Brazil perform dances at the festival to the dead in which they are masked as birds, animals, or insects. The mask-head- dresses of the Karaya Indians are strikingly similar to those of the Duk-duk society in New Britain (Thomas, op. cit.). Masks are confined to the basin of the Amazon, and apparently do not exist further south than 150 south latitude (Ehrenreich, America, South). Alexander, however, says that the Fuegians have masks. He considers that the mask reaches its highest development in the totemic tribes of northwestern America, in the Pueblo-tribes of the southwest, and in Mexico, Peru, and northwestern Brazil (Alexander, Secret Societies). The Popul Vuh, sacred book of the ancient Quiches of Guatemala, mentions a bird-dance: "they danced the Owl, the Weasel, the Armadillo" (Raynaud, Le Livre, p. 69). Masks are not men- tioned, but very probably they were worn. Honduras has masks which represent ancestral spirits (Spinden, Lectures). With the Pueblo and Zufti Indians of the western United States to put on a mask is to become the deity which it represents (Crawley, op. cit.); this is probably true everywhere. To achieve identity with the gods is the origin of ritual dances, which undoubtedly are inconceivably ancient. But besides the high feather-head-dresses, the scenes on the drums have another element which is associated with the islands of the Pacific-the boat with the bird-prow and bird- stern. This is found far afield; the raft-like canoes of the Morioris of the Chatham Islands have two conventionalised birds on the stern-board, and two projecting sticks at the prow</page><page sequence="109">ONE HUNDRED ONE which end in carved birds' heads. White sea-birds' feathers extend from the foremost seat to these heads (Skinner, Morioris, p. 114). The natives of Dorey, New Guinea, adorn the high prows of their boats with a human figure whose head is a bunch of cassowary feathers (Wallace, Malay Archipelago, p. 511). In Tahiti canoes sacred to the gods were decorated with feathers, and the prow and stern, sometimes twelve or fifteen feet high, bore the carved head of a sea-bird, or a spirit-image. The God's image, covered with the sacred red and yellow feathers, was placed in the canoe, which was accompanied by followers in long double-canoes, each of which had two great drums on board, which were called "Sounding- at-sea" (Henry, op. Cit., p. 120). In the Kojiki, there is a reference to the "Deity Heavenly- Bird-boat" (p. 120), who also had another name, "Deity Bird's-Rock-Camphor-tree-Boat" (p. 33). Another book of Japan, written c. ioc8, mentions birds on the boats of China: "The boats were carved with a dragon's head at the prow, and painted with an image of an osprey at the stern, completely in the Chinese style" (Murasaki, Tale of Genji, translated by Waley, I, p. 479). Such boats could still be seen in Chinese harbors a few years ago. The Dyaks of Borneo believe that the souls of the dead are transported to heaven in a ship with bird-prow and bird-stern (Goloubew, L'Age). Goloubew has pointed out the resemblance between the ceremonies depicted on the drums and the funeral rites of the Dyaks. With the latter, several months are required for the elaborate preparations of food and offerings, and for the building of a house for the soul. The house has painted and sculptured ornaments which signify the sacred home, and which have supernatural powers. When all is prepared, the people meet at the house of the nearest relative of the dead person, bringing musical instruments, the khene and the drum, on which they play day and night to drive away evil spirits and announce deliverance to the soul. Priests and priestesses participate, and sorcerers drive off the evil spirit-birds which lie in wait to carry away the soul. Rice is husked for offerings; there are ritual dances, processions and feasts. After seven days of the fete, the house is placed on the boat, the soul takes possession and is transported to Paradise. The boat is the "Golden Ship", and is super- naturally the same ship which originally brought the Dyaks to Borneo. Its mast is a perch for the auspicious spirit-birds which accompany the soul; a canopy on the deck shelters drums and gongs. A spirit, Tempong Telon, is at the helm. Goloubew suggests that the deer depicted on the Dong-so'n drums may represent deer killed by the man in his life-time whose souls go to heaven to plead for or against him (Goloubew, op. cit.). Karlgren explains the deer by terming them "cervid-men" (Karlgren, op. cit.). It is possible that the deer may represent the souls of ancestors; they have this significance in Sarawak, Borneo, and also among the California Indians (Thomas, op. cit.). The natives of Popayan, Colombia, believe that they are the souls of good people (Frazer, Adonis, p. 286). Deer were associated with fertility among some of the American Indian tribes; the Delawares held a feast at the ripen-</page><page sequence="110">ONE HUNDRED TWO ing of the corn at which venison and corn were eaten by twelve old men, and only after that could the new corn be eaten by everyone. Any venison which was left over was burned, as none must remain when the sun rose, and none of the deer's bones must be broken. The Florida Indians stuffed an antlered deerskin with various herbs and hung it on a tree, with the head facing the east. They then prayed to the sun that the plants might continue to grow. Perhaps the Papago rain-dance, which is performed under a pole surmounted by a deer's head, had a similar meaning (Thomas, op.cit.). In Africa antelopes are associated with fertility. Seven different varieties symbolise Nyame, Supreme Creator and Mother- goddess of the Akan of Ashanti, the gazelle being her moon-aspect, certain others being connected with the sun. On ceremonial swords the antelope is depicted with triangles on its flanks, as that part carries the fawn, and it is the part of the venison always given to the Q~een-mother, in order that she may have children (Meyrowitz, The Sacred State of the Akan, PP. 73, 92). The Bambara of the French Sudan hold auspicious antelope-dances at the time of sowing, and again at the harvest. The dancers are costumed and masked, and the dances imitate the actions of the antelope. The masks are surmounted by very much stylised wooden images of male and female antelopes. The males have manes, elaborately pierced and conventionalised, and horns which are slightly curved at the tips; the horns of the females are exaggeratedly long and perfectly straight. Fawns, which may be either male or female, stand on their backs (Lem, Sudanese Sculpture, p. 22; PIs. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,. 26, 27, 28). So far, there is no explanation as to why the does on the Dong-so'n drums have antlers as well as the stags. It may be that the antlers, which are always apotropaic, symbolise the supernatural power of the does. Nioradze says that the Shaman's antlers sig- nify his ability to move swiftly (Nioradze, op. cit.). An instance of women dancers imper- sonating deer by wearing antlers occurs on a bronze bowl of apparently southern Chinese origin (P1. XXVII). The Kojiki mentions a "Heavenly Deer-deity" (Kojiki, Sect. 32). The idea of the soul-ship is not confined to the Dyaks; it is a concept which is typical of many islands in the Pacific, based on the believed desire of the soul to return to the land of the ancestral spirits, originally the Asiatic mainland. With the passage of time, the ancient land may become another island, a mythical island, the western horizon with the setting sun, Paradise, or the vague sea. In Florida and Eddystone Island in the Solomons a ship takes the soul to the spirit land (Moss, Life, p. 19). The association of the boat with the dead is very close throughout the Pacific. With the Olo and the Ngadjoe the words for "canoe"l and "coffin" are practically identical (Moss, op. Cit., quoting Kruijt, p. 25). Kruijt furthermore says that the same is true of the Dyaks, Torajas and Massians. The miniature houses for the soul are made only by the Dyaks, Torajas, Gorontalese, and Galalarese (Kruijt, Indonesia). Survivals of the soul-ship are widespread over the Pacific. In Samoa, the dead may be put in a canoe and sent adrift (Williamson, Polynesia); however, the Samoan</page><page sequence="111">ONE HUNDRED THREE chief was buried on land in a decorated canoe (Moss, op. cit., p. 1o). In the Society Islands, the canoe was taken to the opening in the reef, then brought back, placed on a platform, and eventually buried beneath it. The Marquesans also placed a canoe-shaped coffin on a platform. In New Zealand, the canoe was placed on the top of a pole (Williamson, op. cit.). In Hawaii the chief was buried in a warrior's canoe (Moss, op. cit.). Traces of the soul-ship exist on remote Easter Island, where some of the Ahu, the funerary platforms which are always built by the sea, are boat-shaped, with high curved prows and sterns (Metraux, Op. cit., P. 287). The Mamberamo of New Guinea place the dead in small boats on high decorated framework (Haddon, New Guinea). In Sumatra there are large stone sarcophagi in the form of an animal with three horns, which some natives say carry the soul; others call them boats of the dead. They are not oriented toward the sea. Plain coffins with covers in the forms of boats are also used. On Mentaur, an island west of Sumatra, the ship of the dead has a great serpent or a winged demon at the prow (Schnitger, Monuments megalithiques de Sumatra). In a district on the island of Nias, large benches before a house are called the "black ship" and the "white ship". Their origin is unknown (Schnitger, Monuments, etc., a Nias). The soul-ship also survives in Sumatra on fabrics which are used only for ceremonies or for funerals (Steinmann, Les Tissus). Moss differentiates between the funeral-boat and the soul-ship; to the writer, they seem to be included in the same concept. It is curious to note that in the ancient cemetery of Sumer, which Woolley dates from 350o B. C. to the First Dynasty of Ur, some of the early graves contained models of boats made of bitumen, and filled with clay vessels holding food (Woolley, TheSumerians, p. 35-36). A Buddhist festival in Japan is apparently a survival of the soul-ship concept; "The Festival of the Further Shore" is referred to in the famous novel, "The Tale of Genji"; in a note Waley says that the Further Shore is Nirvana, to which the Buddha carries the souls of the dead on the Ship of Salvation (Waley, Tale of Genji, I, p. 43!, n). Is there an echo of the soul-ship still further north, on the island of Yezo? The Ainu mark the graves of men by a pole which is shaped like a spear, but which they say represents an oar (Rivers, Ships and Boats). Moss considers that the elaborate food and offerings for the soul transported on the soul- ship are of Malayan origin, and are derived from the Malayan "disease-boat," the canoe which takes evil spirits, particularly those of disease, out to sea. The extensive ceremonial preparations, she says, exist only where there is Malayan influence. She attributes the Golden Ship of the Dyaks, and the soul-ships of Buru, Ceram, Timorlaut, and the Luang-Sermata group to this origin (Moss, op. cit., pp. 8, 29). But there are at least three Polynesian boat- ceremonies which involve elaborate preparations and which can hardly have been inspired by the Malayan disease-boat. In Tahiti formerly, when the land had been invaded and desecrated by war, a great ceremony was held for the "re-sanctification of the land". After</page><page sequence="112">ONE HUNDRED FOUR rites at the Royal and the other marae, everyone went to the shore for the ceremony called "sending off the canoe bearing away sins". "The canoe was well fitted out with mat sails, flying pennants, and a long steering paddle attached firmly to the stern. It was manned with images representing men made of braided coconut leaves, dressed in maro and capes and with turbans upon their heads set over cloth masks for faces, and holding paddles on each side alternately; an abundance of food was placed around them, and some presents for the gods of the ocean". The priests drew the canoe to the sea, where the high priest addressed the figures in the boat, saying that the canoe was carrying away "the sins of the people" and "the pollution of the land". As the canoe sailed away, the high priest apostrophised the gods (Henry, op. cit., pp. 321-2). The "maro" is the loin-girdle. The use of the word "masks" is misleading, as masks are not found among the Polynesians. These were merely cloths colored or dyed to represent faces. In the original ceremony undoubtedly the canoe was manned by living men. Since the images of the guardian-priests in the temples of the gods were also made of coconut leaves, it is possible that these men waere priests; however, as the Tahitians used the cocoa- nut palm leaves and fibres in many ways, this is only a possibility. What is apparently a shrivelled relic of this rite exists in New Zealand, where a Maori tribe performs a ceremony by which all the sins of the tribe are transferred to an individual to whom a fern-stalk has been attached. After the ceremony, the man leaps into the river and unties the fern-stalk, which floats away carrying the sins out to sea (Taylor, Te ika a Maui, p. Ioi). Besides the re-sanctification of the land, ceremonies to honor the gods in their canoes, and ceremonies at the launching of a new canoe also involved feasts and rites. The re- sanctification of the land rites might occur only once in a generation; other festivals may have been given to commemorate a certain event. It seems possible, in the writer's opinion, that the festival on the Dong-so'n drums may have represented a particular occasion rather- than a recurring funeral ceremony, for the following reasons: The scenes on the drums show two elements which are associated with islands of the Pacific, -the feather-head-dresses, and the bird-boats, and a possible third, the soul-ship. There is no doubt as to the presence of the first two; concerning the third, the difficulty for the writer is to understand why, since the ship transporting souls to the ancestral land is an island- concept, should soul-boats be depicted on the drums of Dong-so'n, which is on the mainland? The answer may be that these are not soul-ships, and that the ceremony is not a festival for the dead. The similarities between the rites of the Dyaks and those on the drums are striking, but there are also marked dissimilarities. An analysis of the Ngoc-lu drum-probably the oldest of the drums, certainly the clearest, and the key to all the others in the writer's~ opinion -shows the following differences:</page><page sequence="113">ONE HUNDRED FIVE I . The drum has a preponderance of birds and of bird-costumed figures; the ceremony must involve birds. 2. People on the boats are armed with weapons; even one woman on land holds a long spear. 3. There are two structures on the drums, instead of one house for the soul. 4. Both structures are on land and not on the boat. 5. The boats on the drums are rowed by oarsmen in ceremonial feather head-dresses. No one rows the Golden Ship of the Dyaks; there is only the spirit Tempong Telon at the helm. 6. The boats on the drums have no mast for the spirit-birds which accompany the soul. The Golden Ship has a mast for these birds. 7. On the boats of the Ngoc-lu drum there are drums; otherwise none of the articles of the preparations on land are apparently on the boats. The Golden Ship is crowded with objects. 8. On one of the boats on the drum there is a large frog with long legs. It is dispropor- tionately large in relation to the people on the boat, which suggests that its symbolic role was of great importance. It seems to be the prototype of the frogs in the round which appear on the later drums (Goloubew, op. cit., PI. XXVII). There is a triumphal element, an atmosphere of gayety, in the scenes on the Ngoc-lu drum. This of course is not incompatible with a funeral ceremony. The natives of New Ireland hold memorial ceremonies from one to five years after a person's death, elaborate rites called the Malagan. The preparations take nearly a year; masks, figures, and friezes are carved. A large quantity of food is collected; traditional processions and dances are per- formed, feasts are held; the occasion is a joyful one (Linton and Wingert, Arts, p. i6o-i). A more convincing argument against the Dong-so'n ceremonies having been funereal is that though, as a rule, funeral rites are of all others the most conservative, the ceremonies on the drums do not last. Hardly are they depicted on the Ngoc-lu and the Mu'o'ng drums than they begin to disappear. The subsequent history of the decor on the drums might be described as the triumph of the great frog of the Ngoc-lu drum over the bird-costumed people and their land- and boat-ceremonies. The people and scenes disintegrate, and eventually disappear as such, while the frog emerges into the round, and takes a dominant position on the tops of the drums. The changes may be traced through the Mu'o'ng drum, already less clear and more stylised than the Ngoc-lu drum (Heger, Die alten Metalltrommeln, Pls. 1, 11, 111, IV, V); through the Laos drum, whose people are still in bird-costume, but whose boats have no bird-prow or stern (Karlgren, The Date, P1.5); through the Tongking drum, with its excessive simplification (op.cit., Ps. 6, 7); the SaleMer drum, with its strange, bird-headed boat filled with disintegrated passengers, if that is what they are, its frogs, and 14</page><page sequence="114">ONE HUNDRED SIX its neat elephants and birds which suggest a Hindu textile (Heger, op. cit., pl. VI; Karlgren, PI. 8). Frogs also appear on the Wilczek drum, where they are larger than the accompanying leopards; here the boats are mere crescent-shapes, and the people have become a band of eyes and feathers (Heger, op. cit., VII). On the Hsi I drum the boats are loops; the people a confused feather-pattern (op. cit., PI. XI); on the Hsi IV drum, there is a row of scale- pattern where the boats used to be; and a band of disintegrated feather-pattern (op. cit., PI. XII). On the Wien drum the boats have completely disappeared, and the only relics of the figures are vertical feather-panels (op. cit., PI. IX, X). Yet the bird-cult continued, though not on the drums. Goloubew says: "Un texte du Tang Chou cite par Hirth (op. cit., p. 243) mentionne parmi les tribus du Tongkin les barbares Teao aux 'tetes volantes', ou 'tetes d'oiseaux', dont les ceremonies se reglaient au son des tambours de bronze" (Goloubew, op. cit.). Karlgren quotes Goloubew's description of a funeral which he saw among the Mu'o'ng near Hoa-Binh, at which servants in mourning carried the family drum, escorted by Thang- mo men holding long plumes. Sorcerers followed in single file, disguised as birds, "quite like the persons on the Hanoi drum". This is the Ngoc-lu drum, but one can hardly call the persons there "disguised". There was said to be a mysterious connection between the plumes waved during the ceremony and the supernatural powers of the drum (Karlgren, op. cit., p. Is). In Nias, drums, or even stone drums, may contain the souls of chiefs (Schnitger, Nias, P. 83). One may conclude that, judging from the disintegration on the drums and from these ceremonies just cited, the feather-costumes and the drums themselves are indigenous, and that the ceremony with the land- and boat-scenes was either not indigenous or not a cere- mony for the dead. The elaborate preparations and offerings depicted on the Dong-so'n drums may have been the source of those later used for the Golden Ship and for the Malay "disease boat"; certainly the earliest examples known are depicted on the drums. The same is true of the high feather-head-dresses. They are, in the writer's opinion, probably in- digenous; they may be the origin of the island feather-head-dresses. It seems to the writer that, whether or not they are the origin, their connection is with a particular culture of Melanesia, and that they are not derived from the bird-headed deity of the Huai Hu in China. Apparently neither the Bird-headed deity, nor the full-faced deity survive the Late Chou period in the forms they have on the Huai Hu, but bird-headed deities of some sort appear at least till the late Han period; and there may be curious survivals of the full-faced deity which will be discussed further on. Nor are there later repetitions of the Chang-sha deities, so far as the writer knows. Perhaps a survival of one feature exists; the high cap worn by the deity in the bird-mask (PI. XXII) may have been the origin of the cap worn by the Han Bird-deity.</page><page sequence="115">ONE HUNDRED SEVEN Bird-headed people who may be Bird-deities appear on a bronze bowl in the Freer Gallery. Some of them have also birds' tails, otherwise they are human (PI. XXVIII). The design lies like a frieze around the bowl on the outer side, and on it is the repeated scene of a game-drive. The technique is primitive; there is no composition or arrangement; the animals, usually so beautifully depicted in China, are feebly drawn and poorly constructed. On the upper row at the extreme right a man is killing a wild boar; below him are four deer without antlers. Facing the man is a strange bird, with long jaws like a crocodile's; around its neck is a rope, with an arrow tied to one end and a weight on the other. Below the bird is the archer who has just shot the arrow. This type of shooting is mentioned in the Chou Li, where the different types of arrows are described: ((Les fleches de hauteur, les fleches taillantes, servent pour le tir 'a corde)). Commentator B says fles fleches Tseng sont attachees a une corde)). The Tseng and the Fo arrows were used to kill birds on the wing. The arrow-heads were heavier than the ends (Chow Li, II, p. 2 41-2; Note i, p. 242). Under the archer a man with two swords is attacking one of the deer, and below him is a large fish. At the top of the next row is another crocodile-jawed bird, which has long trail- ing legs, ending in two claws, and no rope about its neck. A kneeling archer below is shooting upward at the bird. Beneath him a man, apparently crawling on the ground, is grasping the leg of a goose; underneath is another large fish, similar to the first one. Next, at the top, are two birds addorsed; the one on the right resembles the first bird with the rope, the one on the left is a smaller type, with short legs. Beneath them a man with a bird's head has just shot an arrow at the large bird. Below him stands a man with a bird's head and tail, holding a rectangular object which may be an axe, in one hand, and a rounded one in the other. He faces the man with the goose, and stands above the tail of the second fish. At the top next there is a contest between two men; to their right and left are undecipherable objects. The man on the right has an animal-head; it may be that of a bear. Below them a bird-headed, bird-tailed man attacks a wild bull with a sword in his right hand and an unknown object in his left. The bull has remnants of the spiked mane seen on the bull on the Chinese Government Hu. Under these two are an elephant with outstretched trunk, and on either side of the elephant is a deer in a singular position which perhaps signifies leaping. Below is an animal which is apparently a bull, though in this case the tail differs from that of the bull above, being three-pronged at the end; a hare comes next. At the top there is a chariot, being driven toward the right. The driver is tailed and is apparently a bird-man. At the back of the chariot another bird-man is shooting an arrow at a bear, before which is a small bird. The two horses which draw the chariot are depicted as though lying down with their backs to each other. This is a primitive method of re- presentation, which occurs in the Bronze Age. The back of the chariot ends in a long horizontal tree, with stiff leafless parallel branches. Under the horses is a leaping stag with</page><page sequence="116">ONE HUNDRED EIGHT antlers; below a bird-man with two swords is attacking a tiger; beneath them are a deer, and an animal which may be a wild boar. Its head is swine-like, and it has a very long tail which curls and ends in three prongs. The boar-like creature on the fragment of a gray pottery Chio, found at An-yang, also has an unnaturally long tail (Hentze, Mythes et symboles lunaires, Fig. 70). Below the bear is a running deer, and under that a second chariot, this time being driven to the left. A bird-man drives four wild asses; another bird-man at the back of the chariot is throwing a spear at the tiger. The asses also are represented as though lying on their sides on the ground, and there are two trees at the back of the chariot, which are smaller than the tree on the upper chariot. Below the wheel is another wild boar. With the next row the scene begins to repeat, but in this case the man killing the long-tailed boar seems to be a bird-man. The diversity of animals is reminiscent of the great imperial game- drives mentioned in some of the early books, in which the bag included tigers, wild boars, elephants, and perhaps a rhinoceros, as well as enormous numbers of food-animals and birds. The presence of Bird-deities is enigmatic; the scene may have had a symbolic significance peculiar to some local district. A Hu now in the Guimet has a similar scene, though there are marked differences. The drawing is more skilful; the roped birds are definitely geese. But here with two of the archers, one end of the cord is fastened to the bow; only one rope shows the weight at one end. Other differences are that there are no chariots, nor trees, nor bear; and that here there are fantastic as well as naturalistic animals. The elephant appears, with curious feet and an unnatural hind leg; Vandier calls this a rhinoceros; the long-tailed boar is present, and also a short-tailed boar; the bull, deer, and hares are shown, otherwise the creatures are imaginary. The hunters wear head-dresses; one lies dead, transfixed by a short spear. One hunter has an animal-head; Mme. Vandier calls it a buffalo-head; it might also be a bear's head; the muzzle suggests a carnivore rather than a buffalo, and the covering of the arms suggests fur (Vandier, Un vase chinois du Louvre, Figs. 4, 5, 6). There are no fish in this register, but some appear in the register with the archers and the geese. On the Freer bowl the birds and fish are also associated. Two singular bird-headed hunters are shown on Fig. 6 (Vandier, op. cit.). They have curious head-dresses like large ears, one of which is pierced by an arrow. They hold bows, and wear wing-shaped skirts which are reminiscent of the garments of the deities on the Huai Hu (PI. XXIII). Vandier suggests that this scene represents a shamanistic cermony. On the Freer bowl the only supernatural beings are the Birdmen who are spirits of the upper air. They are using their bows and arrows only against the birds, with the exception of the Bird-man who is apparently aiming at the bear; against the animals they use daggers, swords and spears. A round lacquered box in the Nelson Gallery is a unique example of an extraordinary</page><page sequence="117">ONE HUNDRED NINE blending of man- and bird-forms. On the cover of the box are three creatures: one a bird with a high crest curling forward, a body covered with dots, and four legs with human feet; a second bird is similar, but the crest is very small, and the hind-legs are uncertain. The third bird, which carries itself like an ostrich, has a slightly longer crest than the second bird, a dotted body, and two small forelegs, crossed, and ending in points, which are held in front of the breast. The bird is in the act of running, and the legs and feet are human (P1. XXIX). The line following the contour of each bird's back connects it with a stylised dragon, whose head shows open jaws, sharp teeth and tusks, and apparently a horn on the tip of the jaw. A wing and two claws appear. The wings of all three dragons vary. The contour-line on the dragon's body curves upward to join the round disk at the center of the cover. Conventionalised clouds appear at the edge of the design. The three tightly-coiled spiral-rounds on the central disc are repeated in the decor; they rise from the dragons' bodies, and appear in the curved ends of cloud-lines, and are curled up in clouds at the edge of the design. Those on the central disc are therefore also clouds. The spiral-rounds do not touch any of the birds. Differences in detail occur: the contour-line connecting the bird with the high crest with the dragon has two dragon-claws; the same is true of the line which connected the bird with long human legs with a dragon. The contour-line on the short-crested bird has no claws, but below the bird there is an object which may be a cloud. Near the bird with the long legs are three dots, one smaller than the other two, which do not occur anywhere else on the cover. The significance of the design apparently is that the human-legged Bird-forms, which may be Bird-deities, are being carried up into the clouds by dragons. Another type of Bird-deity appears at this period on belt-hooks, one of which is in the collection of H. M. King Gustav VI of Sweden. A human-like figure with arms in a twisted position crouches at the flat end of the belt-hook. The head is somewhat bear-like, but it seems to have a beak and a sort of crest. The hand has savage claws, and there may be feathers on the body (Palmgren, Selected, P1. 28, Fig. 145a). Palmgren considers that this belt-hook, which is said to have come from Shou-chou, shows Ordos influence. A belt-hook from the collection of Mr. Falk is illustrated on PI. XXX. Here the Bird-deity has a powerful human figure; he stands gripping one end of the belt-hook; both his hands and feet have savage claws. His head, which is turned to one side, is that of a bird of prey, with large eyes and a broad predatory beak. A crest, which resembles the horn of a ram, rises from the top of the head and curves down to rest on the right shoulder. A second example, from the collection of Mr. Minkenhof (P1. XXXI a), shows a figure with a beaked head which is partly human. The face has something of the Levantine character which also appears in the face of the Bird-deity on a mirror (P1. LIII), and in those of some figures on a Six Dynasties mirror (P1. LVIII). This deity has heavy three-clawed hands, one of which grasps the belt-</page><page sequence="118">ONE HUNDRED TEN hook, and only one leg, with an un-human, four-toed foot. The presence of these fierce deities no doubt endowed the belt-hooks with the protective powers of talismans. LATE CHOU-HAN In this period a Bird-deity of a completely new form appears, differing not only from the preceding types in China, but also, so far as the writer can discover, from all others in the world. The significance of the deity also has a new emphasis. This Bird-deity, usually designated as "the Bird-man of Han", has been called "a minor deity of the Taoist Pantheon" (Rostovtzeff, Inlaid Bronzes, p. 37). One source of his origin no doubt is indicated in a passage in the writings of Chuang-tse in the fourth century B. C., in which Kien Wu repeats the description of the spirit-like man of Tao as given by Khieh- yu, the famous "Madman of Khu", who was a contemporary of Confucius and appears in the Analects, (XVIII, 5): "Far away on the hill of Kii-shih there dwelt a spirit-like man ... he did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew ..... he mounted on the clouds, drove along the flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself beyond the four seas; . . .by the concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save men from disease and pestilence and secure every year a plentiful harvest" (Chuang-tse, Book I, Part I, Section I, 5). Kii-shih is said to be "a hill in the north sea". This idea of the spirit-like man of Tao, endowed with the power of flight and with other supernatural attributes, became merged with the ancient concept of the Bird-deity. The earlier deities were not connected with the official religion, but the Han Bird-deity is definitely associated with Taoism. Inscriptions on some of the mirrors on which he appears describe his activities, which resemble those of the spirit-like man; they both mount upon clouds; they both drive dragons; they do not eat ordinary food; they are auspicious and powerful, and dwell in the heavens. The tangible result of the two merging ideas is a fantastic human figure, incredibly attenuated, on whose arms and legs long feathers grow which proclaim his other-worldness. The Han deity is never a Shaman, temporarily endowed through investiture and rites with the powers of the divine bird; his bird-powers are intrinsic; he is always a supernatural being; divinity is his perpetual nature. The thinness and the feathers are his most characteristic features; otherwise there are variations in the many representations. The deity's head, with two exceptions, is always human, and almost invariably shown in profile: he may have long floating hair, or wear caps of several different kinds. Frequently he has a beard he may occasionally have large ears; sometimes his cap seems to be eared like a rabbit, or a deer. He has almost invariably no wings, but he may have a bird's body, or a bird's tail. His arms are often merely lines; his.</page><page sequence="119">ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN hands and feet frequently end in scrolls. He always appears in the sky, or in the Taoist heaven. He is usually accompanied by the four animals of the cardinal points; the tortoise- and-serpent of the north, the tiger of the west, the vermilion bird of the south, and the dragon of the east. He is one of a brotherhood; one, two, three, four, six, or more Bird- deities may appear on the same article. There does not seem to be any connection between this Bird-deity and the ancestral spirits; he is not a household god, and being a Taoist, needless to say he has no connection with ritual in the form of a dance or any other form. He has, of course, the powers of a talisman, but he is even more auspicious. The emphasis of his significance now is on what the Chinese have always considered one of the greatest blessings, longevity, an approach to immortality within life; and on immortality, longevity beyond life. Since the perfect Taoist can go directly from longevity into immortality, the Bird-deity represents both. He bestows long life, which may be why he so frequently appears with a beard; he makes the elixir with which one can attain immortal life. He has a fantastic playfulness amid the freedom of the skies; he is more detached, more abstract than the previous Bird-deities. He might be described as an impersonal incarnation of immortality. Until a very late period, the Han deity is never static, but is represented in a variety of poses. He may be seated; seated with crossed knees; or with one leg outstretched, or beside a gameboard or cauldron; or seated contemplatively. He may kneel on one knee, or on both knees, or appear in a curious pose between kneeling and running. The Condor-deities on the Sun-gate at Tihuanacu are in this pose (P1. X). The Han deity is found crouching forward and leaning on his elbows; bending; offering; supplicating; slinking; withdrawing; running away; walking on clouds; feeding a tortoise with a plant; pounding herbs to make the elixir of Immortality; holding a plant, or some other object; confronting animals; teasing animals; trying to mount animals; riding on animals; riding backward on animals; running away from animals; chasing a chariot; riding in chariots; perched on roofs; in attendance on Hsi Wang Mu. The two most frequent positions are those of kneeling in its various poses, and riding on animals. In the latter case the deer is ridden more frequently than all the other animals combined; the tiger and the dragon appear much less often, and for about the same number of times; other steeds are the horse, the bird, and composite animals. The next two most frequent positions of the deity are those of being seated and of running away. The Han Bird-deity rarely appears in the round, but almost invariably on flat surfaces; on a wall-painting; on lacquered objects; articles inlaid with metal; tile; stone bas-reliefs; carved jade; and principally in low-relief on bronze mirrors. The date of the earliest appearance of the Bird-deity is uncertain. On the mirrors he appears first on the type which Karigren designates as L Category mirrors, and which he</page><page sequence="120">ONE HUNDRED TWELVE dates from c. 1oo B. C. to c. 0oo A.D. (Karlgren, Huai and Han). The majority of the objects on which the deity is found may definitely be dated Han; there are, however, two articles which are Late Chou, and which both present unique aspects of the deity. One of these, in the writer's opinion, shows the two earliest examples so far known of the Bird-deity. The article in question is a ceremonial bronze sword inlaid with silver and gold; the hilt is missing. Both sides of the blade are engraved with scenes showing a Bird-deity with animals, and birds, clouds, mountains, and plants. On one side of the blade is a Bird-deity running to the spectator's right and looking back at a large bird, which he is tantalising with a circular object which he holds in his hand. Other animals, not illustrated, on this side are a deer, a bear, a bull, a tiger, a charging bull, and three birds apparently wild geese (P1. XXXII A). On the other side a deity is running toward the left and looking back at a dragon. The other animals are a doe, a charging boar, a bear, a hound chasing a hare, and four birds. Both bears are in somewhat human attitudes (PI. XXXII B). The sword shows influences of the Huai style; the type of bull with long sharp horns is similar to the type of bulls on the Hu; the circles for jewels on the animals' bodies is an Ordos feature introduced into Huai (Karlgren, Ordos and Huai, BMFEA, 9). One reason for considering the sword to be pre-Han, in the writer's opinion, is the appearance of the two Bird-deities. They have the usual attenuated bodies, the feathered arms and legs, but their heads differ from all the heads of the Han deities, being completely the heads of birds. In A, the deity has a round bird's head, with a shapeless crest, and a short beak; the neck is human, but there is a wing and a long tail. The calves of the legs are depicted, but the feet are clawed. In B the deity's bird-head is longer, with a pointed crest, and a long beak; he has a bird's neck, and a bird's tail and three-clawed feet. The round object with which the deity in A is teasing the large bird may give another reason for dating the sword as pre-Han, as it resembles the Pearl, or the Golden Fruit, which were introduced from India in the Late Chou period (Salmony, The Magic Ball and the Golden Fruit). Xfter the sword, the bird-heads do not appear again; in all the later representations the heads of the deities, although they may be somewhat bird-like, are definitely human. The second Late Chou example appears on a rectangular plaque of carved jade, one end of which has been broken off, leaving part of a dragon and a curious Bird-deity. He is standing upon clouds and bending forward with one hand held out conciliatingly toward the dragon. The arms and hands, and the feet which are apparently shod, are atypically human. The deity is also unusually well clad; he wears a garment with a decorated collar, sleeves and belt; and trousers to the knees are indicated. He has no long feathers on arms and legs, but he has a wing and a bird's tail. The most extraordinary feature is the head, which is neither a bird's nor a man's, but apparently a monkey's (P1. XXXI B). The only</page><page sequence="121">ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN explanation which the writer has to suggest is that this type of monkey is an importation from India, where, more than in any other country, the animal was an important god, being guardian of forests, villages and forts, protector against whirlwinds, and having many temples dedicated to its worship. Since certain Hindu elements appear in China in the Late Chou period, it is possible that this monkey was also introduced at that time. This theory finds some support in Salmony's article The Magic Ball and the Golden Fruit (Art and Thought, p. Ios). In this he discusses these two Hindu "Globe symbols" and illustrates a Late Chou belt-hook on which a monkey is grasping a globe, which represents the sun (op. cit., Fig. 2); he also mentions a second belt-hook on which the monkey holds a flat ring resembling the "pi", symbol of heaven; and a third, on which the monkey holds a disc engraved with a six-pointed star surrounding a circular center. In this case Sa]mony suggests the possibility of an eclipse-of-the-sun motif, (Salmony, op. cit., p. 107). The connection of both the Bird- deity and the monkey with the heavens is probably the factor which has united them in one figure on the jade plaque. The Han Bird-deities on the mirrors are undoubtedly descendants of the deities on the inlaid sword; the monkey-headed Bird-deity may represent a group of which he is so far the only one discovered. HAN The mirrors outnumber all the other objects on which the deity appears, and also outlast them in time; the other articles will therefore be discussed first. They include inlaid bowls, an inlaid tube, inlaid belt-hooks, lacquered bowls and boxes, a bronze incense-burner, a bronze horse-frontlet, a pottery figure, a painted tile. For the first time, the Bird-deity appears in an official religion; he is found on the wall-painting of a tomb in Manchuria, and on the stone bas-reliefs of the Wu tombs in Shantung and in tombs of Szechuan. Especially interesting Bird-deities are the three on an inlaid bronze bowl formerly be- longing to Mr. Loo. They are in the characteristic poses of sitting, kneeling, and running away. The best example of the deity seated contemplatively is here. This deity, bearded, and wearing a pointed cap, is seated with his hands clasped around his knees; he has the tranquil detachment of a Taoist sage. Another, also bearded and with a pointed cap, and with unusually wing-like arms, is running away from a dragon. The third, who is kneeling, has a pointed cap, but no beard. His arms are merely lines (Rostovtzeff, Inlaid Bronzes, IX, XII). On this bowl are two of the strange creatures which very occasionally appear in association with a Bird-deity, fantastic animals with the deity's head. Here a dragon has a similar head (op. cit., PI. I, 2); and another dragon-like animal has the deity's head with a pointed cap (P1. V). Other examples occur on the mirrors; one creature has a curving beard, and a long ear resembling the ear of a deer (P1. XXXV). A bird appears with the 15</page><page sequence="122">ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN deity's head and the long cap (Karlgren, Huai and Han, PI. 79, L, i). On the border of a centerless bronze disc in the Dumbarton Oaks-Harvard University Collection are two creatures of this type. In one case the head is much more human; it has a beard, long hair, and an elongated streamer or crest. The front and hind feet are clawed, and seem to be more human on one side of the body than on the other. The animal on the opposite side of the border has a more stylised head which seems to be beginning to disintegrate into scrolls. Both creatures have long scalloped tails. A bronze inlaid tube in the collection of H. M. King Gustav VI of Sweden is perhaps the most perfect example to be found of Bird-deities in a transitional stage. At the base of the tube two deities are kneeling, with peacocks beside them. Above, two others are standing with upraised arms, also separated by peacocks. The feathers on the arms and legs are be- ginning to thicken and become cape-like and skirt-like. The poses of the deities are also more rigid and less flowing than those of the figures on the inlaid bronze bowl (Palmgren, Selected, Fig. 139). This rigidity is one of the ways in which the Bird-deity degenerates later on. A bowl formerly in the Eumorfopoulos Collection shows a Bird-deity in a characteristic pose on the rim; no feathers, however, can be discerned (Eumorfopoulos Catalogue I, P1. XLVIII). Another bowl, from the same collection, dating in the period of the Six Dynasties, shows an unusual scene. A hunter with a large axe is apparently threatening two kneeling Bird-deities. One has large ears and scroll-like feet; the other has feathers on his arms. In the center, a snake with a human head is standing upright like a cobra or hamadryad. Yetts gives no interpretation of this scene (op. cit., I, PI. L). Still in the same collection is a painted pottery tile, on which figures are placed in a Taoistic setting. Their attitudes and actions are characteristic of Bird-deities, but owing to the damaged condition of the paint, the details are not clear. On the right is a seated figure with a beard, floating hair and outstretched arms. Beyond are two figures riding stags. On the left side are three figures riding stags (op. cit., Chinese, etc., Painting, PI. I). A Bird-deity riding on a stag among clouds is on the inside of a bowl found in the Lo- lang district of Korea (Archaeological Researches, Text, No. 279). Another deity, less distinct, is on the border of a broken bowl (op. cit., PI. 57I). In the tomb of Wang Hsuo, also in the Lo-lang province, a small lacquered box was found. On the cover are nine persons and four Bird-deities. The deities are beardless; they are kneeling and bending forward; the rounded tips of their long caps also droop forward. Their arms and legs are feathered, but their hands and feet are unusually human. The deities are not supplicating; they seem to be arguing with great animation. These are the most beautiful of all the Han Bird-deities. The linear quality of the figures is exquisite; though drawn with entire simplicity they possess vitality and extraordinary grace (Harada, A4 Report, Pls. CIV, CV, CVII). *</page><page sequence="123">ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN In the same Korean tomb lacquered boxes and fragments of boxes or bowls with Bird- deities depicted on them were found. One fragment shows an attenuated deity, apparently lacking feathers, among clouds, with two dragons and several scroll-like animals (op. cit., Fig. io, c). Another deity appears on a box, with clouds and birds (op. cit., PI. XC). On a small box is another, also with clouds and birds (P1. XCII). A large feathered deity is on the cover of a round lacquered box (PI. XCVII). There may also be Bird-deities on PIs. XCIII, 2 and XCVI, though they are not certain. In the Musee Guimet is a gilded bronze horse-frontlet on which is engraved a Han Bird- deity walking on clouds (PI. L). This deity has some unusual features; he has large erect, rabbit-like ears; his hair floats back in a solid piece, like that of one of the Erickson deities (PI. XIX, B, XX), as though something were wrapped around it: he is less thin than the usual deity, and seems to be wearing a garment, which may be feathers. He is in the act of stepping upward on the clouds," and his feet seem to have some sort of cover- ing. In his raised right hand he holds a plant with three large flowers. Other peculiar features are arms which are much larger than usual, and rows of dots upon the thighs. There seems to be some obscure connection between the bird and the horse, perhaps between the flight of one and the speed of the other. Horses with birds' heads appear at this period (Sumitomo, 1,11; Chavannes, Missions, P1. LXX, no.134). One horse has a tail which ends in a bird's head (Eumorfopoulos Catalogue II, XV, B 24). In Memoires historiques, the con- nection also occurs: ((L'arriere-arriere-petit-fils de Ta-hien s'appelait Mong-hi Tehong-yen; il avait un corps d'oiseau et une voix humaine. L' empereur T'ai-meou entendit parler de lui et consulta les sorts 'a son sujet: (les sorts repondirent) si on fait de lui un cocher ce sera favorable)) (Se-ma Ts'ien, op. cit., II, p. 3). In the Guimet is a bronze incense-burner, which represents a Bird-deity in the round, riding on a composite animal, usually designated as a chimera. The deity has feathers on his arms and on his right leg. An atypical feature is a large wing with long feathers drooping over the left leg (Shina Kodo-Seikzwa, III, PI. 243). Siren illustrates a pottery dragon ridden by a figure which may be a Bird-deity. He wears a pointed cap, but apparently has no feathers (Siren, L'Epoque Han, P1. ioo). A Bird-deity about whose identity there is no doubt is found in the wall-painting of a tomb in Mu Cheng-i, in southern Manchuria. He is painted walking upon clouds confronting a large bird, which resembles a wild goose. Hamada considers that this is a deity welcoming the soul of the occupant of the tomb to the Taoist heaven (Hamada, On the Painting, etc.). A tiger also appears on the wall, probably in his role of guardian against evil spirits. These frescoes are far more skilfully painted than the over-door decorations, which are exceedingly crude. One, however, is of interest. Over the south door of the tomb-chamber is a half-figure, unfortunately damaged, with a curious, non-human face, a round eye,-the</page><page sequence="124">ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN other eye being obliterated-and arms from which feathers extend. The arms end in pole- like stumps instead of hands. This figure is reminiscent of both the deities on the Huai Hu; it is full-faced like the one, and it has stumps for hands as has the Bird-headed deity on the Chinese Government Hu. The feathers on the arms link it with the Han Bird-deity. It may also have some connection with an enigmatic figure, full-faced and feathered, which appears with the Bird-deity on some of the mirrors, and will be discussed later. It is doubtful if the true deity is found on the bas-reliefs of the tombs of Hsiao TYang Shan. One figure is on a roof, a position typical of the Bird-deities at the Wu tombs. (Chavannes, Mission, PI. XXV). There is a bird with apparently three human heads (op. cit., PI. XXIX), which may be a mountain-deity. On the walls of Wu Liang in Shantung, Bird-deities appear in the scenes representing Heaven. One is seen riding on a one-bodied animal with a head at either end; this ancient Mesopotamian type of creature also appears in pre-dynastic Egypt on the Narmer palette (Quibell and Greene, Hierakonpo/is, II, PI. XXVIII). One deity is on a roof (Chavannes, op. cit., PI. LI); six attend Hsi Wang Mu (PI. LIII, lo); another is on a roof (P1. LXV); on PI. LXVII one is with Hsi Wang Mu in the sky; one is again with Hsi Wang Mu who is in a cloud-chariot on P1. LXVIII. On P1. LXIX a deity is in a chariot with a winged figure who may be the western Qeen Mother. Two Bird-deities are among winged figures which are variously riding dragons, driving in a chariot, or flying on clouds (P1. LXX). In P1. LXXIV, 14i and 142, Bird-deities are in attendance on Hsi Wang Mu. Among the many winged and flying figures on the Wu Liang bas-reliefs are birds with human heads (PIs. XLIV, LIII, LXVII, LXXIV). These are probably mountain-divinities, which are described in the Chan-hai-king (pp. 199, 254). The association between birds and mountains perhaps dates from the time of the similar "mountain-spirit" and "great bird" characters. The winged persons with birds' heads (op. cit., PI. LXXVII) are probably a survival of the deities of Chang-sha and the Huai Hu. One figure has a bird's head and arms as well as wings (P1. XCIII). Bird-headed figures also occur in the bas-reliefs at Nan-yang; un- fortunately no photographs of them are available. Some bas-reliefs from the cave-tombs of Szechuan have recently been published; the Han Bird-deity appears on these, and two un- usual bird-headed figures are also found (Rudolph and Wen Yu, Han Tomb Art of West China). The tombs examined are at Chia-ting, eighty miles south of Ch'eng-tu, and near Hsin-chin, a village twenty-five miles southwest of Ch'eng-tu. In spite of their proximity, the two groups of tombs are dissimilar. The reliefs showing the Han Bird-deity are all from Hsin- chin, where they originally adorned stone coffers found in the tomb-chambers. One of these reliefs shows two groups of persons; on the left, a large bird perching on a pole overlooks two Bird-deities seated on the floor with a game-board between them. Their rounded ears,</page><page sequence="125">ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN or ear-caps, are prominent and animal-like. Only one Deity has feathered arms, apparently, but as these illustrations are from rubbings it may be that both have. In the foreground is a long table, beyond the game-board is a small, low table. A plant-like element, curving over one Deity's head and ending in peacock's feathers instead of leaves, separates this group from a musician, his listener and a smaller bird on the right (op. cit., PI. 56). The same scene with certain differences occurs on another relief (P1. 57). The bird, much smaller than the one on PI. 56, is flying above the Deities. These have rounded ears which are even more animal-like than those on PI. 56. Both Deities have feathered arms, and feathers appear on the legs of the figure on the right, whose arms are raised in a frenzied gesture. The game-board between them is surrounded by a bowl and a cup, both holding ladles, and a low table. The Deities are seated on cushioned material. A low, very much conventional- ised plant rises behind the one on the right. Stamped bricks were also discovered in the tombs and elsewhere. One of these, dated to correspond with 96A.D., shows on the left a striding figure with a raised right arm and an abnormally long left arm stretched out and ending in three fingers which hold a ring, from which issues a plant-form. A large bird perches on this elongated arm. Before this figure, apparently trying to escape from it, is a curious version of the Bird-deity, with an open mouth, upright feathers on its head, long feathers on its arms, three-clawed hands and feet, and a long feather for a tail. On the right a figure, also with abnormally long arms, is ap- parently seated, but with the legs, which have clawed feet, in a curious position. An element may be drapery, or a tail; the latter is perhaps more probable (PI. 98). On another brick is a human-headed bird which wears a high head-dress or hat. Its neck is thick and long; its body is a moon-disc showing the cassia tree and the three-legged toad (P1. 64). On another brick, from Ch'eng-tu, is a human-headed bird wearing a three-pointed crown. The body is apparently the sun-disc, but the design is not discernible (P. 95). Dr. Rudolph says that these "winged beings " are unique and suggests "that they show Taoist or outside influence" (op. cit., p. 36). THE MIRRORS: HAN TO SIX DYNASTIES Mirrors were religious symbols; they possessed divine properties; they penetrated beyond externalities and reflected the soul. The mirror had the Shaman's power in reverse; where he could see the human form beyond the outer animal shape, the mirror could detect the evil animal-spirit masquerading as a human being; and it was not only apotropaic, it had also the power to destroy evil. It was therefore protective both in life and after death. Mirrors were worn in the girdle as early as the 7th century B.C. (Karlgren, Huai and Han). The round form signified Heaven. Taoists wore mirrors to avert evil influences, and</page><page sequence="126">ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN centuries later Buddhist priests used them to drive away wicked spirits, or placed them within the bodies of sacred images (Swallow, Ancient Chinese, p. 54). The Tungus Shaman, as has been said, wears a brass mirror at the front of his head-dress. It is probable then that everything in the designs on the mirrors has a symbolic religious meaning. The three great centers of bronze-mirror-making were in the Huai Valley region in Anhwei, Lo-yang in Honan, and Shou-chou in Anhwei. Karigren, in his chronological analysis of the mirrors, has enumerated them alphabetically, beginning with the A category in the 6th century, B. C., and going as far as the L category, c. 0oo B. C. to c. 0oo A. D. (Kargren, Huai and Han). The early mirrors have a high relief which sinks to a diminuendo on the D category mirrors of Lo-yang in the 4th and 3 rd centuries, and begins to rise again in what Karlgren very descriptively calls the "raised thread" relief on the F mirrors of Shou-chou in the 2nd century; the relief first appears on only a part of the mirrors, the remaining part being flat. This low "raised thread" relief covers the entire surface in the L mirrors, and lasts through late Han, when the relief begins to rise again. The L mirrors, c. 100 B. C. to c. 1oo A. D., are the first mirrors so far known on which the Han Bird-deity appears. Certain elements from the earlier categories appear, for instance the quatrefoil, from the C category; the beautiful D mirrors, characterised by very low relief, superlative workmanship and representations of extraordinarily fantastic animals, have had a stylistic influence on the mirrors and on other objects in Han, in the writer's opinion. The E mirrors, Shou-chou, 250-200 B. C., originated the rope pattern with a raised line, which appears on some L mirrors; the F mirrors, as has been said, originated the "raised thread" relief; inscriptions, giving the date, began on the J mirrors of Lo-yang and Shou- chou in the 2nd century; these become messages wishing good fortune on the K mirrors of the same period. In this category also a few large hemispherical knobs appear instead of the small fluted ones characteristic of the earlier categories (Karigren, Huai and Han). The L mirrors are characterised by having the "raised thread" relief; by inscriptions, which are longer and more elaborate than those on the J and K mirrors; by large hemi- spherical knobs. They are beautifully made of a metal whiter than any previously used; the rim is thicker than the central part. The arrangement is concentric; the borders have a definite pattern; either that of conventionalised clouds, or a. triangular pattern called the saw-tooth pattern. The cloud-border, in the writer's opinion, is the earliest border of the Bird-deity mirrors, depicted to suggest his environment and that of the symbolic animals. The saw-tooth pattern, however, outlasts the clouds, and continues into the period of the Six Dynasties. The L mirrors are frequently decorated with four or more small knobs, which often have an astronomical significance; four may denote the four quarters of the earth; five the five planets, the five points of the compass -north, south, east, west, center -or the five bles- sings -old age, wealth, health, love of virtue, long life; seven may signify the five planets</page><page sequence="127">ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN and the sun and moon; eight may mean the Pa Kua, the eight Taoist Immortals, or the eight periods of the year (Swallow, Ancient CGinese, p. 20). The Bird-deity is always accompanied by animals on the early L mirrors and on the later ones which have animal-borders. The four animals representing the cardinal points are almost always all present; the deer, the horse, the ibex, the bull, and perhaps the elephant, also appear, as well as creatures with the Bird-deity's head, other composite creatures, and a great variety of birds. Many of the L mirrors, particularly those with square centers, show curious signs which resemble the letters T LV; these will be discussed later. Three mirrors with cloud-borders are illustrated (PIs. XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV). The first has the large knob on a quatrefoil, surrounded by a square; a T sign makes the center of each side. The L's, touching the border, are opposite to the T's; the apex of each V is opposite to a corner of the square. Within the square are twelve small knobs, separating the characters of an inscription. Along the outer sides of the squares are eight larger knobs, set in eight-pointed star-shapes within circles. The design is in the "raised thread" relief. At the base of the design is a Bird-deity kneeling on one knee, holding up a scroll-like plant. The deity, feathered on arms and legs, has a beard, long erect ears, and floating hair. Behind him, with its back turned, is a large bird resembling a goose. Before him is a dragon running in the opposite direction. On the right the following design shows a dragon-like creature with a mane and two goat-like horns on the left, and on the right the tortoise- and-serpent emblem of the north. The third section shows a winged carnivore, a bird which suggests a quail, and a winged tiger. On the fourth section is a galloping ibex, with a small, dove-like bird above it, another round bird, and a large crested bird, confronting the bird behind the Bird-deity, which it resembles. The design is bordered by a ring of the rope- pattern, a plain ring, a ring of triangles, the cloud-border, and beyond that a plain edge (P1. XXXIII). P1. XXXIV shows a mirror with the central knob encircled by a band, and surrounded by the square. The T LV signs are present and also the eight knobs. The design is sur- rounded by the same five types of bordering rings. In the section at the base a beardless Bird-deity is kneeling and leaning forward with his hands on the ground. His hair falls forward like a great curling feather from his raised head. On the right is a dragon running in the opposite direction. The next section on the right shows a winged deer, and the tortoise-and-serpent. Beyond is an animal very similar to the deer, but with a longer horn, a long tail, and no wing. It is addorsed to a stalking tiger, On the fourth section stands an egg-shaped bird, with a round head, a crest and long tail. On the right a bird of the same type is lying on the ground. This one has a high curling crest. P1. XXXV shows a different type of mirror, where there is no square, and the whole</page><page sequence="128">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY arrangement is concentric. The knob rests on a plain ring; the next ring contains nine knobs separated by spiral curls; then there is a circle of the rope-pattern; a plain circle; a circle apparently containing five stylised birds with sharp beaks and long tails; a plain circle; the design; and the various circles as in the others. The arrangement here is different from the other two cloud-bordered mirrors. Seven knobs separate the seven figures. At the base is a Bird-deity bending down and forward, touching what is apparently a scroll-like plant. The deity is bearded, his nose is beak-like, and his head is reminiscent of the bird-mask on P1. XXII. He has long floating hair, feathered arms and legs, and bird's body and tail. This is one of the most bird-like of all the Han deities. On the right is a running tiger; then a stalking tiger looking back at the first one; a flying bird with a long crest, open beak, and long tail with curling feathers. On their right is a singularly reptilian bird, with a snake-like neck and tail, and a long curling crest. This bird, flying with its body higher than the head, which turns back toward the tail, seems to be the prototype of birds which appear on certain mirrors of the Six Dynasties. The sixth animal lies on its back in a distorted position. The writer does not know what it is intended to represent. The seventh creature is one of a type which occasionally appears-creatures with the head of the Bird-deity. The animal here is apparently a tiger. The head is beaked, like that of the Bird-deity on the right, but there is a much longer beard, curling upward at the end. Plates XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII show L mirrors with the saw-tooth border. Plate XXXVI has T LV signs, and a square which is large in proportion to the whole mirror; the V signs almost touch the square's corners. The design is bounded by a circle of rope- pattern; a plain circle; a circle of triangles; a circle of double triangles; a circle of plain triangles; and a plain outer border. Eight knobs are at the ends of the T-bars. In the design at the base at the left is a Bird-deity riding to the left on a deer. The deity is beardless, and has either a large ear or an eared cap, and long hair. On the right are the tortoise-and- serpent. On their right is a kneeling Bird-deity, very much like the one on the deer, but; holding one hand before his chin. A round bird is on the L sign, and beyond that is a strange creature which the writer cannot name. In the next section is a long-necked bird with the Bird-deity's head, beardless, eared, and long-haired. An animal resembling a frog is on the L; beyond it is an elaborate crested bird. In the following section are a winged ibex and a winged tiger. Plate XXXVII shows a mirror with the concentric arrangement, the square and the T LV signs being omitted. A plain circle lies around the knob; then one with nine knobs and spiral curls; a circle with a design of discs and spirals; a circle with triangles. Seven knobs separate the seven figures. The six circles of the border are the same as on the preceding mirror. At the base is a kneeling Bird-deity, beardless, and capped, with one arm extended which holds a narrow curved object. To the right is a bird of the round bird type; beyond.</page><page sequence="129">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE is a flying bird with a long beak. A tiger follows; then an ibex; then the tortoise-and- serpent; and finally the dragon; there are therefore the four cardinal animals, the Bird-deity an ibex, and a round bird. The mirror on Plate XXXVIII has the somewhat unusual combination of being con- centric and also having two of the T LV signs, which usually are found with the square center. The central knob is surrounded by a circle of eight knobs alternating with eight characters; two raised circles separate the center from the design, beyond which there is a circle of ten knobs and spirals; then the rope-pattern; the three circles of triangles; a plain circle; and a wider plain circle on the rim. The double-triangles here are very much flattened out. In the design are eight small knobs, the T's and L's; the V's are missing. The T's and L's separate the design into four sections. In the first a Bird-deity is riding on a dragon; the deity has floating hair; one hand rests on the dragon's neck. Before the dragon is a bird. In the next section is the vermilion bird of the south; then the tortoise-and- serpent. Between these and the vermilion bird are two small creatures which may be birds. In the fourth section is a running tiger, confronted by a bird resembling a quail. The T LV signs which appear on many of the cloud-bordered and sawtooth-bordered mirrors have been variously explained. Bishop White's opinion is that they are geometric angles of precision connected with the idea that the earth is square; Karlbeck considers that they are technical in origin, and were intended to cover the ridges between the imprints of the die; Mueller thinks that they have an astronomical significance (Swallow, Ancient Chinese, p. 17). Swallow himself thinks that the signs have no meaning in Han, but were used to fill in space or to separate parts of the design. It does not seem probable, in the writer's opinion, that the signs would have appeared on the mirrors if they had not had a symbolic meaning, since the entire mirror was a religious symbol. Cammann interprets the T's as being derived from the traditional concept of the four gates of the Middle Kingdom; the L's as representing barriers, with which is associated a small bird -called the round bird by the writer-which Cammann considers to be a snipe, the "weather-bird" of Han; the areas behind the L's must therefore be damp places. The V's apparently mark off the boundaries of the four quarters. The T's are gates of the universe in microcosm. He points out the L's all bend in the same direction, giving a rotating effect, and perhaps signifying an association with the four seasons. The L's disappear when the T-gates are transferred to the extremities of the universe; the T's disappear because the gates are thought to be beyond the rim of the sky (Cammann, TLV Pattern). Cammann's interpretation seems the most probable one to the writer. There is certainly a connection between the signs and the early Taoist concept of heaven; the signs appear on the cloud-bordered and sawtooth-bordered mirrors, and disappear when these borders are replaced by others. The T LV signs do not, so far as the writer knows, ever appear in 16</page><page sequence="130">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO connection with Hsi Wang Mu, even though the Bird-deities do. The signs undoubtedly have, as Cammann suggests, a metaphysical significance, which perhaps antedates the Han Bird-deities. There are several exceptions to the rule that the T LV signs appear only on the mirrors with cloud- or sawtooth-borders. The L mirrors develop a most important border, filled with animals, and occasionally with one or more Bird-deities. These mirrors are very numerous and exceedingly interesting. On these the T LV signs almost never appear. The writer has found three exceptions. The first of these is the superb mirror in the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City (Frontispiece). Besides the very rare combination of the T LV signs with the animal-border, the mirror has other unusual features. The central knob is surrounded by a square in which twelve knobs alternate with twelve characters; the design is surrounded by a circle with a long in- scription; then comes a circle of rope-pattern; a plain circle; the animal-border edged by a narrow plain circle; a plain circle; and a plain raised rim. The design is exceptionally clear. At the base, on the left, a Bird-deity is riding backward on a deer, which faces toward the right, with its left foreleg raised and placed upon the bar of the L. The impres- sion given is that the deer has stopped suddenly, and the Bird-deity is about to fall off its back. A large crested bird with a long curling tail faces the deer. In the next section, on the right, is a Bird-deity with a large ear, open mouth, and short beard. He has a round object in his left hand and is in a curious twisted position, as though ready to run away at any moment from the great rearing dragon on the right which he is apparently teasing. The feet of both Bird-deities have claws. In the following section an unknown creature, open- jawed, bearded, winged, with a very long tail and no discernible hind-legs, follows a winged ibex with a huge horn. The last section shows at the left an extraordinary figure which is apparently a large monkey killing a snake by biting it. At the right is a galloping tiger. The border also is of great interest. Directly beneath the deity riding backwards on the deer is another Bird-deity, with a large ear, a tail, and clawed hands. Feathers are absent. This deity is also apparently tantalising a dragon. Behind the deity, on the right, are dis- integrated cloud-forms; then a small creature with a dragon-like head, wings, and a short curled tail. This animal stands on its forelegs, and one hind-leg, high in the air, is being grasped by a Bird-deity riding a stag. The deity's posture is unique. He is throwing himself back as though to avoid the long, ibex-like horn of the stag, and holding the horn with one hand, while he stretches back the other arm to grasp the leg of the creature behind him. There are then more disintegrated clouds, and then a large, cornucopia-shaped shell, with a Bird-deity emerging. This one is much larger than the other two on the border, but he has the same type of head and clawed hands. More clouds follow; then there is a tiger and a large bird; again clouds, and then the dragon which the Bird-deity is teasing. The design</page><page sequence="131">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE in the center is in the "raised thread" relief; the design on the border is in solid low relief, very flat. This seems to be characteristic of the animal-borders. The Bird-deity on the stag in the border, the deity emerging from the shell, and the monkey with the snake are, so far as the writer knows, unique on the L mirrors. The monkey, however, has something in common with a group of singular creatures which ap- pear on late mirrors -it is seen full-face. There may have been some connection with the full-faced figure with feathered arms on the wall-painting in the Manchurian tomb. A very large mirror in the Sumitomo Collection (I, 23) shows one of these figures, full-faced and covered with feathers. Shina Koda-Seikwa, IV, 63, illustrates a mirror with creatures which seem to be all feathers, but which have arms and legs. Plate 519 in "Archaeological Researches in the Lo-lang District" illustrates a figure with human head and arms, feathers to the waist, then wings and nothing else. A full-faced figure, sitting on clouds, appears on a mirror in the Tomioka Collection (P1. XX). It is not thin like the Bird-deity, and is apparently nude. The arm has feathers. Plate XXI shows a peculiar creature, with clawed hands. The Han Bird-deity disintegrates in two different ways, one of which appears in the animal-borders of the L mirrors. In many of them he joins the animals in the borders, where he is usually found crouching or crawling; and where he gradually becomes more vague and scroll-like till he can no longer be certainly distinguished. On mirrors with the high relief the deity becomes completely rigid, static and pole-like. It might be said that he melts into scrolls in the borders, and freezes into a post on the mirrors in high relief Another L mirror with the T LV signs and the animal-border is illustrated on PI. XXXIX. The knob is surrounded by a square with twelve knobs, alternating with twelve characters, and with decorative devices at the corners. Eight knobs appear in the design, which occupies an unusually small space. At the base, on the right, is a Bird-deity, sitting with crossed knees, a very rare pose. He is executed in hardly more than outline; some feathers appear on the body. Opposite to him, on the left, is a dragon walking away and looking back toward the right. In the next section, on the right, are a deer and a tiger. The following one shows two very odd creatures; the one on the right may be a bird. In the last section a crested bird with a very long tail is looking toward a long-beaked bird on the right. Directly beneath this last bird, in the border, is a Bird-deity in a reclining pose which yet suggests motion. He has a large ear, above which is hair hardly longer than the ear; the long chin may represent a beard. He extends his right arm toward a dragon rushing toward him, but looking backwards; his left hand holds an unknown object. To the right is an amorphous creature, with only one leg depicted; then an animal, which seems to be feline, is attacking a creature whose head is not discernible; a tiger follows; an inverted snake-like feline; a strange object which is apparently a deity of unknown meaning; a feline animal which has short horns; an elongated tiger; a Bird-deity in the same pose as the preceding</page><page sequence="132">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR one, though the condition of the border here makes it difficult to be certain. This deity has either a long cap or long hair. The next part of the design is undecipherable; at the end is a dragon's head on a long neck; an inverted tiger-like animal follows; beyond him is the dragon next to the first Bird-deity. The elongation of the animals and the headless Bird-deity are characteristic of the animal-borders. The inverted animals are of interest; on early mirrors the design always faces outward; on some later ones the design faces the center of the mirror; this mirror is evidently transitional. Plate XL shows an L mirror of beautiful, lace-like workmanship. The knob rests on a decorative quatrefoil design, and is surrounded by a circle, in which are nine knobs alternat- ing with a design like an elaborate X. The enclosing square has a character in each corner. Eight knobs lie within the design, which is large in relation to the border. At the base, on the left, a Bird-deity, with hair floating forward, a long nose, a beard, and a large ear, is kneeling with an outstretched arm which ends in a curling line. Feathers appear on the arm, on the body, back, and on one leg. There also seems to be a feathery tail. The deity faces a winged creature with clawed feet, a long neck, and horns. The tail and the chest are adorned with curling scrolls. In the next section to the right is another strange animal, with two tall upright ears and a head which seems to be feathered. It has wings and a somewhat tiger-like body, with clawed feet. Its tail is composed of curling scrolls. Beyond it is the tortoise-and-serpent emblem, which has a unique treatment. The serpent is bearded, the scales are indicated by short horizontal lines, curling scrolls arise from his body. The tortoise, the pattern of whose carapace is also indicated, has a long curving hooked beak. In the next section a rat-like creature lying on its back looks toward a winged tiger, with a very long tail, and a head shown full-faced. On the left of the last section is apparently another tiger, or perhaps a leopard, also shown full-faced, and the vermilion bird is on the right. The animal-border, which is unusually narrow, is unfortunately in a condition which makes identifying the forms difficult. These are particularly elongated, owing to the narrow- ness of the space. The serpent may be seen, and the tortoise guessed at just below the sign in the design; on the right of them is a dragon, confronting another animal, which has a short tail; then apparently another dragon. Beyond him there may be a Bird-deity riding on an animal, but this is only conjecture. A snake-like form is next, then a space which is un- decipherable except for a clawed leg which appears at the end next to the coils of the serpent. The T LV signs appear on a mirror with still another border than the cloud-, sawtooth-, and animal-borders (PI. XLI). The knob rests on the quatrefoil, which is surrounded by the square. Beyond the design is a circle of triangles with enclosed dots; a plain circle; a circle with a design of a dot, three parallel lines, a loop, three more lines, a dot. Beyond is a dotted zig-zag border; then a plain rim. The "raised thread" relief of the design is very high on this mirror. On the base at the right is a rather Mephistophelian-looking Bird-deity,</page><page sequence="133">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE with long hair, a short beard, feathers on arm and legs, and a wing rising from the shoulder. One hand consists merely of two claws; the other, on the end of a very long arm, ends in circular scrolls. He is apparently leaping forward; one foot ends in a long scroll. Opposite him is a rearing dragon, which looks backwards toward the deity. In the section at the right is a composite winged creature, full-faced, with a long neck, ears, a crest and a beard. The body is winged, and the feet are clawed. The composite animal on the right of this one has a tiger-body, a long neck, and a feline head with long pointed ears. Two more mysterious creatures are in the next section; the one on the left has wings and claws, a curving neck, and a large head with horns. The second is decidedly reptilian: it has a long, crocodile-like jaw, with large teeth, and a long tail. A crest ending in a curl is on the head. The animal is in a strange distorted position. In the last section are a tiger and an ibex. In later Han, the "raised thread" relief becomes combined with the use of a higher relief for the figures. This often occurs with the animal-borders, which retain partly their solid flat relief, but now appear with spaces in the animals cut out to the background level (PI. XLII). The mirror's arrangement is concentric; there are no TLV signs. The knob rests on a decorative circle of quatrefoils; two rope-pattern circles and two plain ones separate it from the design, beyond which is a rope-pattern circle; a plain circle; a circle of sawteeth; the animal-border, and the plain rim. Seven knobs divide the seven figures of the design. At the left is a Bird-deity, with flowing hair, a rather large nose, and very long arms; the right hand has two fingers; the left holds a round object. A long wing extends from the shoulder; feathers are on the left leg. The deity is apparently running forward. The whole figure is in low relief; the deity's hair, the stem of a plant, and scrolls are still in the "raised thread" relief. To the right is the tortoise-and-serpent, the tortoise with a long snake-like neck. The next animal is a horse, with open jaws, a triangular striated mane, and apparently a wing. Be- yond is a raging tiger, with a disproportionately large head; then a composite creature, with a very long tail, clawed feet, and a head with one horn. A bird with a tremendously long crest ending in a peacock-feather follows; the tail also ends in a peacock-feather; the feet only are in the "raised thread" relief. The next animal is a dragon, with a bird-like head and neck, an ibex-like horn, and long beak-like jaws. All the figures are in low relief; only details, like claws, etc., are in the "raised thread" relief. Directly under the Bird-deity in the border is the tortoise-and-serpent emblem, presented in a manner which appears often. The serpent confronts the tortoise, and its coils, in large oval loops, surround it on both sides. A tiger is on the right; then a singular Bird-deity, with a large ear, a feathered arm, ending in a curved scroll, thick legs, and a feathered tail also ending in a curl. The deity is bending forward; above the scrolled hand are three dots. An unreadable design which follows ends in the head and wings of a bird; beyond this there is a crawling fox with a long, bushy tail. This fox appears on several of the late animal-borders. Beyond him is a bird, and then a fish,</page><page sequence="134">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX which, like the fox, appears at this period. Next is the long figure of a crawling Bird-deity. Feathers are on his thick arm which ends in two curved hooks. Feathers are on his legs, one of which ends in a hooked foot with a curved hook at the heel. There is no definite head. One curved hook of the arm almost touches the last coil of the serpent. PI. XLIII illustrates a mirror which shows a further stage in high relief, and a further one in disintegration of the animal-border. It is concentric; around the knob is a very much confused pattern of tigers, varying from the thread relief to a fairly high relief. The design is separated from the border by a circle with a long inscription, and a circle of rope-pattern. The seven scenes of the design are divided by seven knobs set on modified quatrefoils. Two Bird-deities, seated on their heels on either side of a game-board, are at the base; be- yond the board are two other objects. The deities have long erect ears, or caps with erect ears; they are beardless. Long hair flies from their heads; wing-like feathers are on their shoulders; feathers are on their arms and on their legs. The legs and feet are unusually human. The deity on the right gesticulates with his right arm; the hand seems to hold a long narrow object. On the right is apparently a secular scene; these are found on late mirrors; then follows a tiger, which is horned, confronting another horned tiger; beyond them is a man riding on a horse; then two people in a chariot drawn by a horse; and finally the figure of a man evidently of terrific strength, who grasps a bull by one horn with his left hand and raises an axe in his right. This bull, like that on Plate XLV, seems to have a connection with the wild bulls on the Huai Hu; it has long, sharp horns, and the tail is similarly treated. The bull's feet are as delicate as those of a deer. The animal- border is divided into four parts by four large disks. Taking first the part beneath the Bird- deities, there is a tiger, full-faced, on the left, done partly by the "raised thread" relief, and partly in the solid relief On its right are two objects which may be a covered and an un- covered bowl. A bird follows, then a deer in a flying gallop, looking back at the bird. The next part on the right shows a huge tiger, so large that only part of it is depicted, and a large bird. After the next disc comes the fox, with his head, body, and part of his tail done in the thread relief; his legs, the top of the tail, and the ends of the long tail-hairs being done in the higher relief. On his right is an unreadable design. The last part has an unde- cipherable element, a great wing, and a large fish. In the main design the only supernatural scenes left are those of the two-horned tigers, and of the Bird-deities. The deities are delightful, and animated enough to suggest that their reposeful occupation may end in flight at any moment. They still have the open-air quality of Taoist spirits. Besides these various types of borders, the L mirrors sometimes appear with plain borders, One of these mirrors is illustrated in Plate XLIV. The knob rests on the long-lived quatre-~ foil; then there is a circle of the rope-pattern; a plain circle; another rope-pattern circle; a.</page><page sequence="135">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN narrow plain circle; the design; another narrow plain circle; a rope-pattern circle; and the wide plain border. The design is divided into eight panels by eight knobs set in circles. At the base a Bird-deity is trying to mount a galloping deer. The deity has no beard; his long hair is blown forward; his arm-feathers are wing-like; a tail is indicated. The deer, which is in the position of the "flying gallop", is winged and has no antlers. On the right is a large crested bird; then a similar, but not identical, bird, followed by an animal which may be a stag, judging by its head, but which has clawed feet; next comes a dragon; then a Bird-deity, which is entirely different from the preceding one. This one has a large nose, long floating hair, and a beard. His body is covered with feathers. He is either kneeling or running with outstretched arm toward a decorative scroll, which may represent a plant, though it does not resemble one. He seems as old as the other deity seems young. On the right is an ibex lying down; and next to it a tiger; a juxtaposition which seems to be frequent on the later L mirrors. A somewhat later mirror with a narrow plain border is illustrated on P1. XLV. The knob rests on a quatrefoil, whose leaves alternate with characters. A plain circle follows; then a band of the rope-pattern, surrounded by the design, which is enclosed by another band of rope-pattern; two plain rings, and a band of the double-triangles follow; then the plain outer rim. The design is divided into four scenes by four small knobs set in plain circles. At the base, two beardless persons in a cloud-chariot are driving a pair of birds, who, curious- ly, are not flying "in step" with each other. On the right, a carnivore of unknown species is fighting with a wild bull, which seems to be derived from the bulls on the Huai Hu. In the section beyond two bearded persons in high-eared caps are in a cloud-chariot driving two dragons; next are two persons, beardless, and wearing somewhat different caps, who are seated in a cloud-chariot drawn by a pair of tigers. All these persons have a decorous scho- larly appearance; no feathers are to be discerned, as they are wearing garments, yet they are in the sky, driving the supernatural animals of the Cosmos. The next mirror, from the Shao-hing tombs, Szechuan, belongs to a group characterised by having figures in a raised relief, the design in four sections, a certain ornateness of detail, and animals of extraordinary, sometimes violent, action. Other peculiarities are animals in different scales of size appearing on the same mirror, and the frequent appearance of horses. The Bird-deity also shows unusual features; he may have a curious head (Umehara, Selected Ancient Mirrors, PI. 6); his hair, or his bird's tail, may end in an S curl (op. cit., PI. 24); he wears strange hats (Pls. 38, 6i); or he may appear in unusual positions (Pls. 41, 6i); standing on one hand on a horse's back (PI. 45), or riding on a camel (P1. 44). The foot of the Deity, the tail of a dragon, or a horse's hoof, may slip over the circle enclosing the main design into the border; so far as the writer can discover this does not occur on any type of mirrror previously discussed. The mirror illustrated (P1. XLVI) with a scroll border, has a large</page><page sequence="136">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT knob resting on an ornate quatrefoil enclosed by a square. The four sections are separated by four small knobs surrounded by circles. The lowest section shows a most unusual scene; on the right a Bird-deity with upraised arms is running away from an individual seated on the left. The Deity is looking back toward this personage, and apparently screaming at him, as his mouth is open. The Deity is feathered on arms and legs and has a large, somewhat rabbit-like ear. His feet are apparently clawed. The personage is seated on the ground, with raised knees. His right elbow rests on his right knee, the right hand supports his face; the left arm is extended and the left hand holds a staff. The figure is executed in a higher and more rounded relief than the Bird-deity, and is evidently intended to be a human being. The head is the curious part: it is surmounted by a helmet-like head-dress, and an eye can be seen, but there is no nose or mouth, chin, or ear. The tight-fitting costume is decorated. The feet seem to be bare. The writer knows of no proto-type that might explain this figure. In the section on the right a very small kneeling Bird-deity is riding on the tail of a rushing dragon, in front of which there is a bird which resembles a quail. In the following section is another unusual scene. A Bird-deity, kneeling, is apparently feeding a bird which is perched on the back of a recumbent ram. This Deity also has rabbit-like ears; the arms and legs are unusually human. The ram, which has an exceedingly long neck, and might be called a deer were it not for the horns, lies with all four feet tucked under him -a position which the Chinese seem to have been fond of depicting. The horns are long and curve down- wards. In the fourth section is a roaring tiger, and behind him one of the quail-like birds. The border is a much disintegrated animal-border, but the dissolved remnants of a tiger can be discerned between the ram and the tiger in the main design; and two birds, one beneath the tiger's foreleg, and a larger one beneath the dragon's hind-leg, are quite complete and clear. The border, though disintegrated, is very handsome in effect, as the lines have the great vitality often found in the Shao-hing mirrors, noticeably in the next one illustrated (P1. XLVII). This mirror has a knob within a square in each of whose corners there is a design of three objects which Umehara calls "combs". In the lowest of the four sections a splendid running horse, thick-maned, short-coupled as are so many horses in Chinese art, is neighing with open jaws. Between his two wings is a square decorated with crossing lines which may represent a saddle-cloth. Above his back, not upon it, a Bird-deity is seated; this is curiously reminiscent of the Hittite bas-reliefs at lasily Kaya, where the figures are above their mounts. The Deity has long hair, blown back by the wind, and apparently bound at the ends, which is unusual. He holds a curved object. On the ground, behind the horse, another Bird-deity, also holding a curved object, is seated. In the section on the right is a winged dragon with a huge ibex-like horn and long whiskers. In the next section is a winged tiger, with great rams' horns extending outward. He is striped like a tiger and spot-~ ted like a leopard. A Bird-deity with bent head is seated, like the preceding one, above his</page><page sequence="137">ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE back, and in front another deity kneels on one knee and raises a hand toward the tiger's whiskers. In the fourth section is another tiger, also winged, striped and spotted, but with- out horns. All the animals are running, all have open jaws, and all suggest great power. The dragon and the tigers have exceptionally long claws. The Bird-deities on this mirror are transitional, their long feathers have begun to thicken and shorten; their bodies are pole-like; the necks of the two riding are bent at an angle which later becomes a distortion; but they still retain something of their original flowing quality. Umehara dates this mirror as Han; it seems to be somewhat later than the preceding mirror to the writer, who would be inclined to place it not earlier than Late Han. An example of this late development is illustrated on PI. XLVIII. The knob is surrounded by a plain band and beyond it are thirty- six dots. At the base Hsi Wang Mu is seated with an attendant on either side. Beyond the attendant on her right a small Bird-deity is walking toward the queen, but looking back, and holding out both hands in an attitude of hopeless- ness. Long feathers fall from the sleeves and the skirt. The attitude of this figure is unique. In the next section, on the right, are two persons in a chariot drawn by six horses. Next is Tung Wang Fu, wearing a three-pointed crown, and seated with four Bird-deities on either side of him. They have thin pole-like bodies; their feathers project like enormous sleeves beyond their shoulders, but the feathers on their legs are merely indicated. Their necks are incredibly thin; they still seem to have large ears. Those on the king's right are beardless; the four on his left all have beards. One offers him a tankard, which may hold the Elixir of Immortality. To the right of this scene is a person in a chariot drawn by seven horses; a parrot perches on the chariot's roof. The animal-border is much disintegrated; but one may still recognise the fish beneath Hsi Wang Mu, and perhaps the aftermath of the fox's tail below Tung Wang Fu. The mirror illustrated on PI. XLIX is somewhat similar, but the chariots have only three horses. Here the Bird-deities have become even more pole-like. Those adoring Hsi Wang Mu have long feather-skirts; their heads are set impossibly upon their necks, and their arms are mere sticks. Two deities are on either side of Tung Wang Fu; the lowest ones are kneeling. Their feathers have become wing-like skirts and striated sleeves. Their heads are small and indeterminate; their arms are bony and clawed. One deity on the king's right seems to have the long ear, otherwise there is little that is reminiscent of the early Bird-deity. The border is of the sawtooth-pattern, which retains its original form longer than the cloud- border, which becomes very much conventionalised. It is only in the borders that the active Bird-deity remains; as the relief becomes higher in the principal designs, so he congeals more and more. A little action is still left on the mirror shown on P1. LI, where two late deities kneel one on either side of a cone or pyramid of round objects. They hold wands or sticks in their hands; the floating hair has 17</page><page sequence="138">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY become a small round knob; the feathers are turning into garments, though, they also appear as feathers. On the right of this scene two similar figures attend Hsi Wang Mu; these are more rigid than the others, with less vitality. Very thick feathers appear on the calves of their legs; their feet are negligible. On the left of the first two deities, two others attend Tung Wang Fu. They are similar to the second pair, except that the deity at the left has a wing at his waist. The fourth section of this mirror shows a dragon. The border is evidently derived from the cloud-borders. On some mirrors the fate of the Bird-deity is even worse. The feathers become heavy, overweighted garments; the deity's body is a pole, his head is a featureless blob. All the early motions have disappeared: the deity now only kneels before Hsi Wang Mu and Tung Wang Fu as stiffly as though rigor mortis had set in, as indeed artistically it has. The relief on the mirrors steadily becomes higher. A mirror in this relief of the 3rd cen- tury is shown on PI. L. Around the still large hemispherical knob is a plain circle, then a circle of design. The supernatural elements are in the inner circle; the outer one has ap- parently only secular scenes, unless the scene with two winged figures concerns Hsi Wang Mu. At the base of the inner circle is a late Bird-deity, kneeling with upraised hands. The pose is awkward; the whole figure is badly drawn. The head is shapeless; the nose is a mere round knob; there seems to be an ear, and an eared cap. On the arms and legs the feathers are so thick that they seem cape-like and skirt-like. Particularly long feathers are at the el- bows. The hands and feet are hardly indicated. Near the face is a comma-shaped object. The deity is between two raging affronted lions. The deity in this pose is repeated three times in the inner circle; in the fourth, there is a small lion-figure, with feathered arms and tail. The head suggests an owl. Whether or not it has any connection with the full-faced feathered creature is only conjectural. The animal-border is very much disintegrated. Be- neath the small lion-figure, slightly to the right, appears the fish; then a feather-like design; a bird's head and neck; and then a confused design; followed by a tiger; then the feather- effect; and then the fox, less elongated than usual. The same feather effect follows, then a crestless bird; more feather effect; then the hindquarters, hind-leg and tail of an animal with an undiscoverable head; feathers again, and among them a Bird-deity, seen full-face, which is exceedingly rare, with one knee bent, and one leg stretched out behind him. He seems to wear an eared cap, and feathers appear on the leg. His limbs are thick, as is often the case with Bird-deities in borders, but his pose is still full of action. A very unusual mirror is illustrated on Plate LIII. On one side of the encircled hemi- spherical knob of the mirror is a bird-figure, having a human head, which is seen full face. It is modelled in high relief, and is entirely non-Chinese; the low forehead, prominent eyes, arched eyebrows, and full cheeks suggest a Levantine type. The hair, very smooth on the head, flows loosely about the neck. The body of the Bird-deity is turned toward the rim of</page><page sequence="139">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE the mirror, but the head is twisted on the long neck so that it faces the knob, and lies al- most at right angles with the neck. Feathers appear on the neck and the body, and a few wing-feathers, large and curling upward, are shown, but the rest of the wing and the tail are cut off by the knob. The leg and clawed foot are those of a bird of prey. The animal on the left has a tiger's head, with a small crest, and an exceedingly elongated lower jaw. Here also the body is turned outward, and the head faces inward. Between the two heads is a small leonine animal, which faces the rim in the usual manner. The design is surrounded by two circles of the rope-pattern, followed by a narrow, much disintegrated animal-border, in which the tiger, the dragon, and the fish can be discerned. Beyond this is a plain border. A strange type of Bird-deity, which attempts to combine the spirited action of the early deities with the stiff form of the later ones, is found on a group of mirrors which, Palmgren says, the Chinese call "the Heavenly Emperors" (Palmgren, Selected, p. 37). This name ap- plies of course to the main design in the center. The mirrors apparently express a reversion to Taoism. They are characterised by having the large Han knob surrounded by a band of lines and inset ovals, a design in very high relief, surrounded by a circle of cartouches, usually ornamented by lions' heads and squares. A band of triangles is beyond this, then a band of animals and figures smaller in size and lower in relief than those of the main design. This band is characteristic of the group; it represents the same legend, or legendary episode, concerning Bird-deities in a chariot drawn by six dragons and followed by deities flying or riding various creatures. The Bird-deities frequently, but not invariably, also appear in the principal design. The borders of these six-dragon mirrors are usually com- posed of highly conventionalised clouds. A very fine mirror of this type is illustrated in the catalogue of the Tomioka Collection, P1. XLI. The date upon it corresponds to 498 A. D. Though this may not be the earliest mirror with the six-dragon band, it has features which some of the others lack. It seems probable that all the group with this particular feature belongs to the Six Dynasties. The mirror illustrated on P1. LIV is a replica of the Tomioka mirror, but less clear-cut and well-defined. The central design is late; it does not follow around the center, but is meant to be regarded from only one angle, like a painting. It contains seated winged mo- narchs with their attendants, but no Bird-deities. The cartouches have lions' heads, with the lower jaws lacking; the squares each contain four characters. In the circle all the figures are rushing rapidly to the left. On the left of the base is a bird in the position of the bird of the cloud-bordered L mirror (P1.XXXV). Behind this is a Bird-deity riding a bird whose tail is a great peacock-feather. Next comes a lion-like full-faced figure, with long feathers on arms and legs; then a flying Bird-deity with a large deer-like ear, holding a disk; another riding on an animal which may be a tiger; cloud symbols, one of which is the coiled spiral seen on the round lacquered box (P1. XXIX); then six dragons, the first with outstretched neck, the five</page><page sequence="140">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO others in a similar swan-like pose; and then cloud-symbols; then the chariot drawn by the six dragons. The chariot is quite unlike those on earlier mirrors, having a long platform with a sort of dashboard in front, a central compartment, and a raised part over a wheel, behind which is another smaller platform. One Bird-deity is in front with hands on the dash-board; a crowned winged figure is seated in the central compartment; and a deity is seated on the small platform in back. Behind the chariot another deity is running, apparently trying to mount it, and followed by two others who are riding on tortoises in the flying gallop attitude. The next figure again suggests a lion, and is feathered. Two figures riding on horses are next; then two figures riding tigers; an unreadable figure; and then a Bird- deity of the pole-type in a flying attitude. The attributes of the deities are more clearly de- fined on the Tomioka mirror. The Freer Gallery possesses a mirror of this type (P1. LVI). Here Bird-deities appear in the central design as well as in the six-dragon circle. One may be seen at the base of the design between a lion, which has a huge head and one clawed foot on which a parrot is perching, and a winged person who may be Hsi Wang Mu. The deity is in an awkward attitude; the feathers are thick, and wing-like on the arms; the head has two ornaments like curved hooks. One of the hands, which are unusually human, holds a round object. The deity is apparently clothed in a garment as well as in feathers. Another deity, kneeling toward two seated wing- ed figures, is in the opposite section. The feathers are thick, but not long. On this mirror the squares again have four characters but the discs are undecorated. In the six-dragon circle, below the first deity, is a flying deity with the deer-like ear, long feathers, and a snake-like body, which is the effect of the pole-body in action. Two deities follow riding tigers with large grotesque heads; then the six dragons and the chariot. The dash-board is lower here, and the platform is boat-like; the central wheel has become a coiled spiral. The same three personages are aboard. A snake-like deity with heavy sleeves and long feathers flies after the chariot, holding a disc. Two galloping horned animals follow; in this case they are riderless. They are followed by two deities riding on strange composite animals. Next is the bird of the L mirror; another bird, much confused; and a disintegrated lion-figure with feathers. Here the central design is earlier than that of the previous mirror, and the six-dragon circle apparently later. In the next two mirrors the motion of the circle is reversed, and all the animals and figures are rushing toward the right. In Plate LVII Bird-deities again appear in the central design. At the base a very small one with feathers on arms, legs and shoulders bends before a seated figure whose face is not defined. On the other side of this figure is one which does not seem to be a Bird-deity though it has feathers. In the next section a small deity lies on his back with upraised arms and bent knees just below the jaws of a lion. Another deity with arms like thin branches is on the other side of a central figure, whose face is hardly indicated.</page><page sequence="141">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE The next scene shows a central figure seated in profile; the hair and the heavy beard may represent feathers. A Bird-deity, with one arm raised, is prostrate in front of the figure; the figures on the left and right may be intended for deities, but they are atypical. The fourth section has winged figures, but no deities. The squares contain only one character; the discs have lions' heads, but the alternate ones are tipped toward one side, showing only half the jaw. In the six-dragon circle, below the Bird-deity first described is a deity riding on a large bird; beyond this, the L mirror bird; then another large bird with no rider. A flying deity, distorted and beginning to disintegrate, comes next; then a deity riding on a huge- headed creature, perhaps a tiger; a disc; then a large fish, probably derived from those on the animal- borders. Next comes the chariot, which is much altered. The back platform and the compartment have lengthened out into a long platform divided in the center by a rhom- boid structure, on which a spiral, the remnant of the wheel, appears. A snake-like deity is on one side of this; on the other the seated winged figure, with another person making obei- sance. On the front platform a deity with a long, rabbit-like ear, is in a flying attitude, and directly before the platform is another. Both of these have arms like branches and no hands. Their legs have apparently become feathers. Cloud-symbols come next; then the six dragons, more widely separated than on the previous mirrors, where they overlap. Before them is a deity riding a deer in the flying gallop attitude; another deer, riderless; a flying deity with forward-blowing hair, and apparently also horns; and cloud symbols. The beautiful gilded mirror illustrated on PI. LVIII is like the preceding one in having the creatures in the six-dragon circle flying toward the right, but it has several features not found on the other mirrors. A tiger is incised on the knob, and instead of the cartouches, there are three types of decorative elements: a stylised flower motif, occurring eight times; a Gothic-looking head with wings rising on the sides, and clawed hands, occurring twice; the third element is the base of a vase-like throne on which a winged person is sitting in the central design and which overlaps into the circle of squares and flowers. This occurs twice; the base of the pedestal rests on an animal in one case; in the other apparently on an animal-like bird. The squares contain each a single character. Another unusual feature is that two of the heads of the four great lions in the central design are human; the other two show a curious mixture of lion and human. The human heads, which are Near Eastern in appearance, have wings rising from either side of the head. The Bird-deity appears in the lowest section, kneeling with arms which end in feathers raised above his head. The feathers seem to form a complete garment. On the right is a crowned person, perhaps Hsi Wang Mu. In the section opposite is a bird like a cock, with a human head, on which there are two erect horns or ears, and two long floating feathers. It may be a mountain-deity. A circle of long sharp triangles separates the central design from the six-dragon circle. The border is composed of highly conventionalised clouds.</page><page sequence="142">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR In the six-dragon circle, below the kneeling Bird-deity in the design, are cloud-symbols uniting the chariot and the dragons. These scarcely overlap here, they are almost detached. To their right, after clouds, is what may be a disintegrated animal or bird, and then a most degenerate form of the Bird-deity, with a snake-like form, flying in the curled-up position of the pole-like type of deity. What may be a feather or an arm, with a very long finger, stretches back; the other reaches forward toward a disk. The head seems to have no human attributes. One foot apparently has large claws. The next creature, an elephant, is a most rare animal on the mirrors. Its mouth is open; the trunk and tusks are well-defined. The feet begin to divide like claws, and the very long tail has a bushy end. The elephant is stand- ing or walking. Two elaborate birds, facing each other, come next; then among clouds two creatures which are galloping toward another degenerate Bird-deity whose long feathers float from his shoulders; one hand is extended toward a disc. The head seems to have a horn; again no human attributes are visible. The chariot which comes next is now so boat- like that the long platform with the structure in the center suggests a gondola. There is a high prow ending in a feline head, and a high stern ending in a curved element. A Bird- deity, winged, apparently bearded and with a long nose, kneels, holding out a thin handless arm toward the winged person beyond the structure, which may be Hsi Wang Mu. Long feathers extend from her right wing and almost reach the Bird-deity's hand. A relic of the wheel is seen in a half-hearted spiral in front of the structure. The front platform is practically detached, and seems to have no relation to the gondola. A Bird-deity, with arm- feathers becoming large wings, and with legs which have apparently become feathers, is kneeling on it. The forward end of this platform is crescent-shaped and suggests the tail of a fish. Palmgren illustrates a six-dragon mirror (op. cit., Figs. 186 b, i86 c-e), and Siren illustrates several; P1. 70, where the chariot has degenerated; Pl. 71; P1. 120, where the chariot has again degenerated, and there are apparently only five dragons (Siren, LP'poque Han). Siren dates these mirrors in the period of the Six Dynasties. Chavannes quotes the inscriptions on three mirrors all relating to T'ai Shan, worshipped by the Chin emperors. He illustrates two, both of which have cloud-borders; it may be as- sumed that the third is also of this type. The inscriptions are interesting to compare with those of later mirrors. Fig. 59 illustrates the drawing of a mirror with a quatrefoil around the knob, surrounded by the square. At the base, a Bird-deity is striding to the left; the tortoise- and-serpent are on the right. To the right of these there is a deer and a Bird-deity kneeling before a tiger. In the next section an animal resembling both a lion and a dragon is on the left; them a round bird looking right toward a dragon (?), and perhaps another bird. On the last section is a bird, an unknown animal in the center, and a dragon on the right. The inscription reads:</page><page sequence="143">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE a Puisse-je monter sur le T'ai Chan, me trouver en presence des immortels, manger dans la perfection du jade, boire 'a la source d'ambroisie, atteler le dragon sans comes et aller par dela les nuages flottants, etre tire par le tigre blanc, et monter droit au ciel, recevoir une vie durable, une longevite de dix mile annees, m' elever dans la hierarchie officielle, assurer le bonheur de mes descendants)) (Chavannes, Le TPai Chan, Fig. 59, P. 425). The second mirror has the square, but no quatrefoil. At the base there is a bird on the left, and a Bird-deity kneeling toward the right. In that section there is a stag and a bird; in the next a bird on the left, and apparently one on the right; in the last section a tiger and a deer. The inscription is: ((Puisse-je monter sur le T'ai Chan, me trouver en presence des hommes divins, manger dans la perfection du jade, boire a la source d'ambroisie, atteler le dragon sans comes et aller par dela les nuages flottants, m'e'lever dans la hierarchie officielle, assurer le bonheur de mes descendants, etre honore, riche et prospere, jouir d'une felicite illimite'e)) (op. cit., Fig. 6o, p. 425). The inscription on the third mirror reads: ((Puisse-je atteler le dragon volant et aller par dela les nuages flottants, monter sur le T'ai Chan, me trouver en presence des hommes divins, manger dans la perfection du jade, me nourrir d'or jaune, m'e'lever dans la hierarchie officielle, assurer le bonheur de mes descen- dants, jouir perpetuellement d'une felicite sans limites etre grandement riche et prospered (op. cit., pag. 426). A mirror in the Sumitomo Catalogue (I, II) has an inscription very similar to the first two quoted. It is cloud-bordered, with T L V signs: "Upon Mount T'ai a Taoist deity was seen. He lived on precious stones, and drank from the limpid springs. He mounted a dragon, rode on a floating cloud, and a white tiger drew his chariot. He went up straight to heaven, and entered into a long life of ten thou- sand years. This mirror augurs public promotion and the prosperous preservation of poste- rity" (Sumitomo I, II), Han. Harada describes this mirror as having "twelve animals and birds"; the writer finds seven animals and two Bird-deities. Several later inscriptions follow: "The Bureau for Imperial vessels nas made a mirror. It is truly excellent. On the upper part there is a Taoist deity. He knows no age; when thirsty he drinks from the limpid springs; when hungry he eats the nuts of the jujube, and he floats about over the world" (Sumitomo, I, 19). "Mr. Chang has made this mirror. He is truly skilled in representing Taoist deities. Deities like Wang Chiao and Ch'ih-sung-tzu as well as supernatural animals like shih-tze and pi'i- lisieli are rare in the world" (Sumitomo, I, 23). Late Han. "I made this bright mirror of truly great excellence. On it are fairies who know not old</page><page sequence="144">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX age. (May it ensure) longevity like that of Tung Wang Fu" (Eumorfopoulos II, XII, V. 20) Yetts dates this mirror in the 3rd century. "Ch'ing Lung made this mirror according to the proper pattern. May it long ensure to both parents prosperity like that of nobles and king. May it ward off evil and inauspicious thoughts; and may it bring endless joy" (op. cit., II, XV, B. 24). This is on a mirror of the Six Dynasties. The prayers for immortality have become wishes for longevity and prosperity in this life; the religious symbol has become a talisman of good fortune; the inscriptions on the later mirrors are increasingly stereotyped wishes for happiness and prosperity in the present life. The Han Bird-deity vanishes in the T'ang Dynasty, reappearing later in the Sung Dynasty when there is a period during which the Han mirrors were copied. Then he disappears again, and the early type of mirror is no longer made. But that is of no consequence; he has already achieved a bronze immortality. While the Egyptians had a mystic affinity with animals, the affinity of the Chinese was with Nature, whose phenomena and beauties they appreciated as probably no other people have. This makes it difficult to appraise their early animal-worship, since, when known Chinese history begins with the last centuries of Shang, the ancestral and the agricultural cults have absorbed the earlier religion. But the animal-cult "dies hard," and some vestiges remain. The Chinese apparently never had Totemism; it is therefore primitive animal-worship that must be considered, which involves the animal-god and the animal-ancestor, often one and the same. The images on the sacred vessels, the marble sculptures, the white pottery and the carved bones are proof of the animal-gods; is there any evidence that the early Chinese believed in descent from animal-ancestors? Among some primitive races there seems to be a connection between the ancestors and the house-front, or the front door, undoubtedly a protective association. Metraux says that on Easter Island pebbles were buried beneath the door-posts of ancient dwellings, some of which had been shaped by rubbing; one triangular stone found had a face outlined upon it. These pebbles kept away evil influences. The entrances to houses are guarded by images of wood or bark-cloth representing lizards or sometimes crayfish (M6traux, op. cit., pp. 264-5). Mallery illustrates a Maori house with the image of a double-headed lizard at the entrance (Mallery, op. cit., Fig. X 8). It has been said earlier in this chapter that the Maori have a belief in, or a legend of, a reptile-ancestor. The lizard is often represented on Easter Island. Ma!-</page><page sequence="145">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN lery states that there are also human figures representing ancestors among the Maori; Skin- ner refers to carved ancestral figures on Maori guest-houses (Skinner, op. cit., p. 68), and to birds carved on the house-fronts of the Morioris of the Chatham Islands, which are usually confronted pairs of ducks (op. cit., p. 1 22). Primitive tribes of Indo-China hang bags filled with divine pebbles on the pillars of their houses (Cabaton, Indo-China). In Alaska, totem- poles by the front door, or decorated planks on either side of it, are associated with the ancestors; sometimes the door is in the middle of a carving. More frequently, however, the pillars depicting ancestral histories are within the houses (Keithahn, Monuments); this may have been due to the climate. No doors or house-fronts of Shang have been discovered, but throughout Chinese history an image of the Tiger has been used as a guardian of the front door, and infant-boys have worn protective Tiger-caps. There are also two passages in the early literature which may be evidence of a connection between the ancestors and the door. In "Legends and Cults in Ancient China" (BMFEA, No. i 8), Karlgren discusses certain individuals of pre-Han times who were members of the Royal House and -of important fa- milies, and who impersonated the gods. They were "Masters of the Five Elements": Wood, Fire, Metal, Water, Earth. In the Yuieh Ling of the Li Ki-the section concerning the proceedings of the government in the different months of the year -these five god-imper- sonators also represent the domestic sacrifices, the Master of Fire representing the Sacrifice to the. Hearth, etc. Karigren quotes four passages from early texts which concern these gods. Those referring to the Fire-god and the Water-god have no descriptions nor is a temple mentioned; in the two other passages the gods are described: "The prince of Kuo (early Chou-time) dreamt he was in the temple; then there was a Shen god (Spirit) with human face, white hair, and claws of a tiger, who, holding a yuie battle-axe, stood by the western slant (of the roof). The god warned the prince about an attack from the state of Tsin. When awaking, the prince let a diviner interpret the dream, and he decided that it was Ju Shou". Ju Shou was the god of Sacrifices to the Gate. From another book Karlgren gives the following passage: "Prince Mu of Tsein (658-6 i B. C.) in clear daylight, in the middle of the day, was in the temple, when a Shen god (Spirit) entered the door and stood to the left. He had a hu- man face and a bird's body, he was dressed in a white robe... his face and bearing were very dignified". The spirit promised the prince prosperity for his state and 19 years of life for himself, and told the Prince that he was Kou Mang" (Karlgren, op. cit., p. ' Kou Mang was the god of Sacrifices to the Door. That the Tiger and the Bird, who are the only creatures represented in the neolithic era, and who appear so frequently on the sacred bronzes, should be associated with the Gate 18</page><page sequence="146">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT and the Door, seems to the writer to be more than a coincidence. The attitude of both the anthropomorphised animal-deities is protective, as it would be in the case of ancestral spirits. Moreover, both appear in "the temple" which is in all probability the ancestral temple. There seems to be an implication here of a genetic connection, but it is difficult to prove the existence of a belief which may have been forgotten as such before the Shang Dynasty. It will be noted that Kou Mang, Master of the element Wood, and god of the Sacrifices to the Door, appears in the form characteristic of the earliest Bird-deities, a human head and a bird's body, and therefore belongs with the deities of Early and Middle Chou. How much more ancient this form may be is not yet known. The antiquity of the Bird-cult is implied in the elaborate dances with feathers which are ritualistic and symbolic. The feather-dances were associated with times of peace, and various feathers were used at the different dances. White feathers were carried in the dance dedica- ted to the spirits of the Four Quarters; in the dance performed to relieve a drought, feathers of the five colors were carried (Chou Li, XII, p. 269). Whites feather suggest the Shang Dynasty, when so much white was used, it being the dynastic color; the five colors are as- sociated with Chou. This of course is not to say that both dances might not have originated in Shang, or both in Chou, though the latter seems unlikely. The feather-dance was accom- panied by the flute (Li Ki, VI, 5; XVII, i). These religious rituals were far removed from the original Bird-dances which were their source, and which were probably mimetic, the purpose being to achieve identity with the divine bird. Bird-dances are found in various part sof the world; many seem to have an ancestral connection, and most of them have, with time, acquired a certain degree of ornateness. One of the most primitive known to the writer is the Plover Dance of Hawaii, the Hula Kolea, where the dancers knelt in rows, all facing in the same direction, and imitated the motions of the plover, while the song-maker sang about some characteristic of the bird "in a fanciful way" (Emerson, Unwritten Literature, P. 219). It is interesting to note that no instrumental music was used with the bird- and animal-dances of Hawaii; the only accompaniments were the songs, a fact which implies an early stage of culture. The Hula Kolea was connected with the beloved (op. cit., p 219), and this connection between the bird and the loved one is also found in the folklore of China, where lovers separated in life become birds after death, and devoted couples are meta- morphosed into Mandarin ducks, emblems of marital fidelity (De Groot, Religious System, IV, 227-28); these are of course instances of the soul-bird. Summarising the Bird-deities, it may be said that there seems certainly to have been a connection between the bird and the ancestral soul, which inevitably endows the Early and some of the Late Chou deities with supernatural powers and makes them talismans of good fortune. That they were personal and unofficial does not detract from their powers. For the Han Bird-deity, with his proto-types in Late Chou, the case is different. He is definitely</page><page sequence="147">ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE associated with Taoism but not with the very abstract Taoism of Lao-tse, with its image- lessness, its serenity and its lofty simplicity. Completely free from the bonds of earth, fearless, wild, whimsical, daring to be amused and gay throughout immortality, he represents the Taoism of the rollicking sage, Chuang-tse. None of the Bird-deities were worshipped. But because what they signified was fervently believed in, they were cherished for over fifteen hundred years.</page><page sequence="148">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE E P I L 0 G U E TWO REPRESENTATIONS OF BIRD-DEITIES IN CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OF THE EUROPEAN PENINSULA THE EUROPEAN peninsula with its adjacent islands is in a sense the epilogue of Asia, its civilisation trailing in time after the great Asiatic civilisations, its culture permeated with Asiatic elements coming from the Near East, or elements from farther regions transmitted through the Near East. Besides great contributions, such as art, religion, astronomy, there were many others, extending down to so-called native folklore, much of which is Asiatic in origin. The peoples of Europe, the majority of whom were in a very primitive stage at the beginning of their recorded history, found it difficult to assimilate foreign ideas which they could not have evolved from their own consciousness; the result was the psychic uneasiness of the Middle Ages. One may speculate as to how different European history might have been if the great Chinese inventions of paper and printing had reached Europe centuries earlier than they did; but paper took one thousand years to come from China and printing approximately five hundred (Carter, Invention of Printing). The introduction of printing coincided too nearly with the Renaissance, that swing of the psychic pendulum back to Greek materialism, with its emphasis on the external, the visible and the tangible. Actually the swing had a deeper significance; it was the return of Europe to its original nature, the genius of the white races being essentially materialistic and secular. It is then that the characteristic history of Europe begins. The Chinese invention of printing ultimately aided Europe in its reaction against Asiatic influences. Besides the many Eastern elements which still remain, and the less numerous contributions from Africa, the European peninsula is strewn with the flotsam and jetsam of prehistoric ideas. All the concepts of primitive races can be found either as concepts, survivals or re- lics; animal-worship, with its attendant animal-metamorphoses; worship of stones, trees, water, sun, moon, stars; the belief that the name is identical with the soul; human sacrifice; cannibalism.</page><page sequence="149">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO In particular there are three factors which indicate that at the beginning of their recorded history the races of Europe were in a very primitive stage. One of these concerns the soul, and will be discussed later. The second factor is the absence of images, which is noted by all the early writers. Mair says that this absence of images is characteristic of the lowest forms of religion, and also of the highest (Mair, Worship, Greek). The third factor is the marked prevalence and duration of snake-worship, of which the writer will give a few examples. The Athenians claimed descent from a being half-man and half-snake, which means an original snake-ancestor; there was therefore a sacred serpent on the Acropolis (Mair, op. cit.). Zeus appears as a snake; Demeter, who is also a pig and a horse, has an attendant snake at Eleusis; in Arcadia she is crowned with snakes, and rides in a chariot drawn by winged snakes. Dionysius is a snake or crowned with snakes; there is a phallic connection here; in the fertility rites for women images of snakes and men were carried (MacCulloch, Serpent-Worship). Alexander the Great had a serpent-father, a snake in the temple of Apollo; Esculapius was a serpent-god (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. 74). Democritus believed that snakes were generated from birds, and that eating serpents enabled one to understand the language of birds. This belief seems to have existed generally in Europe. In Rome the house-guardian of every man was a snake (Frazer, op. cit., p. 86); life depended upon the safety of the house-snake. Snake-pro- cessions near the territory of the ancient snake-clan, the Marsi, were held yearly (MacCul- loch, op. cit.). The Emperor Augustus and the elder Scipio both had snake-fathers (Frazer, op. cit., p. 8i). In the 7th century the Lombards were still worshipping the golden image of a snake. In the i6th century, in Latvia, Lithuania, and Prussia, every father of a household had a house-snake which he fed and to which he sacrificed. The Letts called the snakes and toads the "milk-mothers"; the Lithuanians called them "the living ones". They were as- sociated with fertility, the soul and immortality. Domovoy, the White Russian ancestral house-spirit, is called a snake (Welsford, Serpent-worship.) One of the tutelary spirits which accompany the Lappland Shaman on his spirit-journeys is a snake (Holmberg, op. cit.). Like Zeus, Odin also takes the form of a snake and is called "the Serpent"; and on the tree Yggdrasil there are an eagle, a squirrel, four harts and many snakes (Du Chaillu, op. cit., pp. 56, 32). Taylor refers to the remains of a long serpent-mound on the Downs of Wilt- shire, England (Taylor, op. cit., p. 99). There was of course also worship of other animals. In Argos Zeus is a bull and Hera a cow (Schrader, Aryan Religion); the weasel was worshipped at Thebes; the owl in Athens, where the priests carried stuffed owls as the insignia of their profession. Animal-gods were many in Greece; among those worshipped were the bear, wolf, fox, lion, goat-Athena being originally a goat-goddess-the ass, horse, pig, and mice; the lobster, eel, and certain fish were sacred. In Thessaly ants were worshipped and the stork was divine. Horse-gods were frequent. The Gauls had a horse-goddess, and there are traces of a</page><page sequence="150">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE horse-god. The Germans had a horse-god-ancestor, though they also claimed to be descended from trees, whose spirits, as always, had animal-forms - the owl, vulture or wild-cat. In the 8th century a Papal order forbade the ritual eating of sacred animals in Germany, men- tioning specifically horses, hares, beavers, jays, crows, and storks. The names of the legendary Hengist and Horsa mean respectively a stallion and a mare; and on Bede's list various mythical kings have names derived from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning horse, "vicq" which implies an ancestral horse-god. Horses were eaten ritually in Iceland until 997A.D. In the 1 2th century the principal god of the Slavs was the horse-god, Svantovit, who had a temple on the island of Ruigen. In Wales there was a pig-ancestor, and in certain parts fish were kept to give oracles. Oracles in the Hebrides were given by a man wearing the hide of a freshly-killed bull. The persistence of the earliest religion is shown in the histories of the goose, the hare, and the bear. Caesar, visiting Britain, observed that the goose and the hare were tapu and never eaten (Gabra, op. cit.); Armstrong has collected all the passages in Shakespeare's plays which refer to the goose, which show that at that period it was regarded as evil (Armstrong, Shakespeare's Imagination, Chap. VII). This attitude may be of Scandinavian origin; the goose was also tapu among the Norsemen (Thomas, op. cit.). In some parts of England the goose is still tapu today; and the hare still casts the evil eye on cattle in Eire, and is one of the forms assumed by witches in Somersetshire and on the Isle of Man. Fishermen in De- vonshire will not pronounce the word "rabbit"; they describe the animal instead (Elworthy, Evil Eye). Mutilated remnants of the bear-cult of Eastern Asia can be traced across Europe; the bear's divinity, the procession, his curative and fecundative powers, the decorations. In Lappland the bear is a forest-spirit (Holmberg, Lapps); he is an ancestral divinity to the Finns (Krohn, Finns), who, when bear-hunting, sing an apologetic song begging forgiveness for their cruelty (Nioradze, op. cit.). In eastern Europe, in a Wendish district, there is a custom of dressing a man as a bear, and going with him in a procession, especially in the winter season. In Poland the "bear" is eventually thrown into the water (Thomas, op. cit.). In one part of Bohemia, bears and other animals with rags of colored materials attached to them were formerly paraded through towns and the countryside. The scraps and hairs from the bear were given or sold to people who wanted protection from illness and the evil eye. On Shrove Tuesday, in another district of Bohemia, there was a ceremony in which a bear was impersonated by a man wrapped in straw, and sometimes wearing a bear-mask (Frazer, Spirits, II, 3 26). Berne was a center of the bear-cult, and a small bronze image of a bear with a fertility-goddess, probably of the ist or 2nd century, has been found (Reinach, Orpheus). Among other animal-dances, the Basques had a bear-dance (Webster, Basques). The ceremonies of the Tungus dwindle to a shred in England, where up to 1909 a "straw</page><page sequence="151">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR bear", led by a string, danced at certain periods in front of the houses at Whittlesey, Cam- bridgeshire (Frazer, Op. cit., P. 329). The straw used in these instances probably signified fertility, as in the cases of the straw buck in Sweden; and the straw dogs of early China, used in ceremonies when the crops needed rain. The ability to confer fertility was one of the bear's powers. England was supposed to be Christianised in the 7th century; the ecclesiastical laws of Theodoric, the Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690, are illuminating: "If anyone at the Kalends of January goes about as a stag or a bull; that is, making him- self into a wild animal, and dressing in the skin of a herd animal, and putting on the heads of beasts; those who in such wise transform themselves into the appearance of a wild animal, penance for three years, because this is devilish" (Murray, quoting Thorpe, Witch Cult, p. 21). It is curious to note that the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico celebrate their bison- dance in which they wear a head-dress with horns and bisons' hair on the same dates in January. King Cnut in his reign, ro 17-1 o35, forbade the worship of entirely different gods - the sun, moon, fire, rivers, wells, stones and forest-trees (Murray, op. cit, p. 22). This might seem to suggest that the animals-gods had been completely superseded by Nature-deities, but this is not the case. The worship of the earlier gods had merely become a cult of secrecy and darkness. Murray designates the witch-cult of Europe in the Middle Ages as the "Dianic Cult"; in the writer's opinion it has a far older origin. Among the confusing elements, -the various accretions of later beliefs, -the dominating figure of the god in animal-form, the believed animal-metamorphoses of his worshippers, and their animal-familiars, show that the "Witch Cult" was derived from the most ancient religion. The strength of this pre-historic religion is no doubt the reason why the European Christians accepted representations of the Evangelists in animal-form for so many centuries. Mr. Forsyth has informed the writer that the Evangelists were first anthropomorphised in Ireland. The Book of Kells shows transitional images; Mark has a lion's body and a partly human head; John is completely an eagle except for human feet; Luke is a bull, sitting like a human being (Historia Generale del Arte, p. 1o0). The Evangelists in anthropomorphised form return to the Continent, but the early forms continue to appear through the tenth century (Verrier, Les arts primitifs francais, Pl. 55); the Evangelists as human beings with animal-heads are found as Moissac about 10oo (Evans, Cluniac Art, Fig. i o, a); and the original animal-forms persist until at least as late as 1145 at Charlieu, Loire (op.cit., Fig. 115, b). The European peninsula then as far as animal-worship is concerned, resembles all the other countries of the world. In regard to the soul the case is somewhat different. Belief in the soul, so intense in the greater part of Asia, in Indonesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, the Western Hemisphere and Africa, seems to falter as it approaches the Near East and the</page><page sequence="152">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE European peninsula; the early Hebrews did not even have the dim, sad under-world of the Sumerians; for them the after-life was dark nothingness: Job, X, 21, 22: "Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death. A land of darkness as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness... he fleeth as a shadow and con- tinueth not. When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return." Ecclesiastes, IX, IX, 5: "-but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward." Disbelief in the soul may co-exist with a deep primeval belief in the existence of the spirits of the dead, of which attititude Saul forbidding the mediums to practise and going secretly himself to consult a seeress is an instance. It will be noted that Samuel appears as he had appeared in life, and that he rises from the earth, the earliest home of the soul, which is reminiscent of the often-repeated phrase of the Kwakiutl, "Supernatural-power coming up". The idea of the soul's immortality seems to have been introduced at a late date by the prophets. Frazer has pointed out the similarity between the African and the Hebrew pro- phets (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. 74); it may be that the idea came from a foreign source. Since the Hebrews could not disassociate the soul from the body, their concept of immortality included a physical resurrection (Barton, Soul). Similarly with the early Greeks, the soul was of no importance in life, and the self was identified with the body. Immortality meant a physical continuance. The gods were material; in the hero-cult the spirits of the heroes remained at the graves, where blood and libations were poured on the ground. The snake symbolised the dead; tombstones exist which are carved with a man and a woman offering a libation-cup to a snake (Frazer, Adonis, I, p. 86). Harrison calls the snake "the collected might of the dead", the "reincarnated immortality of the tribe" (Harrison, Underworld); which is a very different conception from that of the life of the individual soul. In the time of Pericles such a concept was entirely unknown. Plato states that Socrates startled his companions by the announcement of his belief in the immortality of the soul. Plato's own conception was that the soul was the source of all motion and was therefore prior to the body. Confusion exists between the idea of the soul at the grave and the later concept of the river which souls must cross (Burnet, Soul); this confusion as to the home of the soul is also found in other places. The Romans were even less concerned with the soul than were the Greeks. Fowler says that there is no trace of any speculation about the soul in living beings until the last cen- tury of the Republic and the introduction of Greek philosophy. Souls were spoken of always in the plural; there was no sign of individuality. In the revival of Pythagoras's theories in the time of Cicero it was believed that the soul of a great man flew upward. The general 19</page><page sequence="153">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX Roman view of the after-life is expressed by Catullus: "Nox perpetua dormienda", and by Pliny the Elder, who believed that it was nothingness (Fowler, Soul). In general the European belief in the after-life was vague; the spirits of the dead remained near the graves or grave-mounds; "they died into the hill." Sometimes they might be re- incarnated (Craigie, State of the Dead). For the Scandinavians the dead became "alfar", elves. Phillpotts says that the early Teutons were less speculative about the relation between matter and spirit than are many primitive tribes. The conception of "spirit" is not expressed in early Teutonic literature (Phillpotts, Soul). The unusual case of a spirit which dies is found in Scandinavia. The fylgja, "following spirit", represents the soul of a man, according to some writers, his mind, according to others. It has the form of an animal or a bird, and no one, not even the owner, can see it unless he is gifted with second sight. The fylgja is protective, but not immortal; it dies when the owner dies. Another family spirit, the Hamingia, which does not die, evidently represents the ancestral family-soul, the fylgia being a personal soul. This distinction also exists among the Eskimos (Phillpotts, Soul). The bird is connected with the soul among the Teutons; there was a Germanic belief that the soul could leave the body in sleep in the form of a white mouse or a bird (Frazer, Taboo, p. 37). Also children were brought by water-fowl from marshes, lakes, ponds, or wells, especially by the swan and the stork. Mogk refers to "Kinderseen" in Germany. In Pomerania there are stork-stones and swan-stones. Children are sometimes called "swan- children". On the chieftain's ship found at Gokstad, Norway, there were the skeletons of sixteen horses, sixteen dogs and one peacock (Strzygowski, Early Church Art in North Eu- rope); it would be interesting to know what significance the carrier of souls at Harappa has here. Birds were also associated with the sun, and were believed to bring the seasons. There is less connection with the soul than is found elsewhere. The significance of the representations of Bird-deities in Christian churches is debatable. Emile Male, in his most interesting book, L 'Art religieux du XI1me sicle en France, has shown that the fantastic and irrelevant people and animals carved on the churches of the Middle Ages have a literary origin, deriving from books of Spain and Greece. These of course contained principally Asiatic elements, and many forms from Mesopotamia particu- larly are recognisable. Judging by the results, the mental attitude seems to have been-that everything in a book had a religious significance. In the psalters and other books of prayer human-headed birds frequently appear in illustrations or in the margins. Verrier illustrates a 7th century figure, a child with a bird's head and a curiously misplaced wing (Verrier, op. cit., P1. 22). Bird-deities are found among the sculptures of various churches. Hooded human-headed birds appear at Hildesheim (Mohrmann and Eichwede, Germanische Frhkunst, P1. \ 7); at Verona there is a human-headed bird with large ears (op. cit., P1. 'I); Maastricht has a carving of two people with birds' feet fighting with shields and clubs shaped</page><page sequence="154">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN like fishes (op. cit., PI. 8o). A curious bird-image with a human head and a nose which is a large beak is at Hamorsleben (op. cit., PI. i i o). Human-headed birds appear in the church of Sainte Mare-la-Daurade, Toulouse, and at Chalais, Charente (Evans, op. cit., Fig. 29 a and Fig. i3 , b). The Bird-deities selected for illustration which seemed particularly interesting to the writer are from the Shetland Islands and from Switzerland. Plate LIX shows a gravestone of the seventh or eighth century from West Burra, one of the Shetland Islands. Beneath a decorated circle are four church officials, below them is a lion which shows traces of "Scythian" influence; beneath the lion are the largest and most important figures on the stone-two Bird-deities facing each other. They have birds' heads with very long hooked beaks which hold a human skull between them; their bodies, and their arms which are grasping axes, are human; their feet are large bird-claws. These deities are undoubtedly Scandinavian in origin; they may derive from the Bird-headed figures holding axes of Bohuslin, or from a common source. One may conjecture as to the significance of the skull; the writer knows of only one similar instance, which does not cast much light. This occurs on the fragment of an Irish cross in the Dublin Museum; here two carnivores with human heads hold a human skull between them (Mohrmann and Eichwede, op. cit., PI. 119). What is clear, however, is that these figures were created by people who believed in them as divinities; the state of mind which produced them was seriously and definitely religious. But what state of mind produced the figures on the 13th century wood-carving in the Mfinster at Bale? (Plate LX). On the right is a man with a bird's body and large wing, tail, and clawed feet, which are also apparently feathered. His face has a pleasant smile; his hair is very thick, long and curly; he wears a hat. He is playing on a musical instrument by turning a crank or handle. This instrument, which is the proto-type of the hurdy-gurdy, was called a Radleier. Its later name in France was "vielle". The other figure is hatless; his curling hair is even more abundant. His expression is grim, and he wields the small bow of his instrument with either anger or unnecessary energy. This instrument is the Dichordium, an ancient instrument which is young compared to this Bird-deity, who is a scorpion-bird-man, descended through the Hittite scorpion-bird- men from the scorpion-men of early Sumer. He has the scorpion-tail, the feet of a bird of prey, and a curious leathery unfeathered wing. The heads of both figures are admirably and realistically executed; they might be, and perhaps were, portraits of mediaeval burghers. The cheerfulness of the Bird-deity on the right gives the impression that the disgruntled attitude of the other figure is merely assumed. Whatever religious significance these figures may have had, the effect is secular and humorous. There is a certain resemblance between the Bird-deities on the Shetland gravestone and the paleolithic Bird-priest in the cave of Lascaux. Both representations are stark in the</page><page sequence="155">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT highest degree, reduced to the very essence of the conception; in both the figures have human bodies, birds' heads, and either hands or feet with birds' claws. But their affinity is still deeper; it lies in the same quality of belief. The Shetland Island deities are separated from the figures in the Muinster by only a few centuries of time; thousands of years se- parate them from the Bird-priest of Lascaux, but the same quality of belief exists in both representations, and spiritually the Shetland Island deities belong with that prehistoric tragic figure, and not with the genial musicians of Bale, who are manifestations of Reinach's "irresistible current which is driving all human thought in the direction of secularism".</page><page sequence="156">ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE SELECTIVE LIST OF REFERENCES ALTHIN, CARL-AXEL Studien zu den bronzezeitlichen Felszeichnungen von Skd'ne.
