WATTS CUNNINGHAM Non-Existent Objects: Recent Work on Brentano and Meinong, REINHARDT GROSSMAN Recent articles and books are listed and three works are singled out for special attention: Gustav Bergmann's Realism: A Critique of Brentano and Meinong (Madison, 1967), Jan Srzednicki's Franz Brentano's Analysis of Truth (The Hague, 1965) and an article by D. B. Terrell which appeared in a special issue of the Revue Internationale de Philosophie dedicated to Brentano. The discussion centers around four prominent attempts to solve the problem of non-existent objects, namely, Brentano's later version of reism, Frege's solution in terms of senses and truth-values, Meinong's theory of modes of being and Bergmann's variation of this theory, and the view that there exists a peculiar intentional nexus connecting mental acts with non-existent objects. This last view, at one time espoused by Brentano, is defended by the author. A Plea for Deserts, ELIZABETH L. BEARDSLEY How to Derive "Better" from "Is", AARON SLOMAN The use of 'better' in such contexts as 'better for', 'better at', 'better as a', is explained by defining 'better' as a logical operator, for use in comparisons of the form 'Better (P, Q, C, R, S, Z)', i.e., 'For members of the class Z, in circumstances S, being P is better in respect R than being Q with reference to satisfying condition C. This form of comparison is called a fundamental comparison. Other forms of statements using 'better' can be defined in terms of the fundamental form, using quantifiers and with 'weighing-up' operators applied to respects and circumstances. Uses of 'better', not covered by this logicist model, can be shown to be explained by reference to the logicist use: e.g., if someone wants C satisfied, then com parisons relative to C may have 'action-guiding' force for him, and in some contexts this kind of force may become the sole meaning of 'better'. It is * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

Deliberation and Determination, J. L. COWAN The paper addresses a cluster of problems involving relations between deliberation and determinism, especially the fact that determinism seems at once inconsistent with and presupposed by deliberation. After initial remarks clarifying deliberation, four "chess playing" machines are described, two deterministic and two indeterministic. It is then argued that positive and enlightening analogies exist between the "deliberations" of these machines and human deliberation. The consistency of deliberation and determinism having been clarified by the machines, two sources of the illusion of inconsistency are exposed, one resulting from confusion of determinism with fatalism, another from problems about agents' predicting their own decisions. The indeterministic machines similarly clarify the consistency of deliberation and indeterminism. It is suggested in con sequence that determinism-indeterminism issues are less relevant to topics such as freedom and responsibility than are questions of kinds of laws and terms related by them. The Electroencephalogram Argument Against Incorrigibility, GREGORY SHERIDAN Versions of the following argument against the Wittgensteinian thesis of incorrigibility are critically examined: 1) It is argued that there is no necessary connection between what a person (honestly) avows about his present sensations or feelings and what his present sensations or feelings really are, that it is at least logically possible that a person be mistaken in his avowal. 2) Situations are envisaged wherein it is claimed that the weight of neurophysiological and other evidence, in the form of electroencephalo gram readings, etc., would be enough to discredit or override a person's honestly avowed report about his present sensations or feelings. It is point ed out that both steps of this argument, as they are usually formulated, are open to fatal Wittgensteinian rejoinders. However, when suitably refor mulated, it is demonstrated that the argument does pose a serious threat to the thesis of incorrigibility. This becomes very clear after it is shown that familiar Wittgensteinian arguments in support of the thesis are incon clusive. Could There Be A Conscious Automaton?, MICHAEL A. SIMON It is argued that the question whether an artificially-created physical system capable of performing in a manner indistinguishable from that of a human would be decided in favor of consciousness for the artifact. The position defended is that mentalistic language not only is the most natural, effective, and efficient language we have for describing either a human or anything whose behavior is similar to that of a human, but that this mode of description can be logically as appropriate for the characterization of the latter as it is for the former, and that the use of this terminology entails the ascription of consciousness to anything to which it is consistently applicable.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 591 The only adequate description of a machine whose behavior is indistinguish able from that of a human would be mentalistic. It would be impossible to employ this mode of description while at the same time withholding ascription of consciousness. What is A Process? STANLEY MUNSAT Certain "properties" of processes, e.g., that they can proceed at a normal or abnormal rate, can be interpreted or completed and can be re versed, can be understood in light of the components or "stages" which, it is argued, all processes consist in. These so-called stages are: 1) an initial state; 2) an event; 3) an episode; 4) a product. Processes are teleological; in an attempt to amplify this and therein round off the account, an appeal is made to the notion of a causal system which in turn is explicated by means of the notion of a "completion guarantee." Once a process is started, it will reach completion through pre-specifiable steps unless it is interrupted or intruded upon. The reason we can speak of intrusion in connection with processes is that nature "sets up" the conditions for processes to begin and run their course. Something which only occurs by chance to begin with is not interrupted or intruded upon merely in virtue of occurring differently a second time. Butler on Bodies, HUGH S. CHANDLER Are the parts of a person's body constitutive parts of the person him self? Butler argues for a negative answer. His argument is based on the claim that the particles which make up our bodies are constantly being removed and replaced while we remain strictly the same persons. The argument seems plausible, in part, because "loose" and "strict" identity are not clearly differentiated, and because the implications of personal memory are improperly understood. Butler has not refuted those who hold that our bodies' parts are parts of ourselves, or even those who say that these are the only parts we have. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. XLVII, No. 1: May, 1969 Measurability, Commonsensibility, and Primary Qualities, G. G. BRITTAN, Jr. Two different ways of justifying the distinction between those qualities which Locke lists as "primary" and as "secondary" are taken up. The first, that the primary but not the secondary are measurable, is rejected. The second, that the primary qualities but not the secondary are perceived by more than one sense, is discussed at greater length and eventually accepted. The focus of the argument is that those who reject this way of making the distinction must admit that it is possible that there be objects which, e.g., look square and feel round and that we have no way of deciding whether the objects really are round or square; but to admit this possibility is to ignore</page><page sequence="4">592 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS certain important features of our concept of a physical object. Finally, some implications of this way of making the distinction are indicated. Dr. Grice and the Contract Ground, R. E. EWIN Bertrand Russell on Vagueness, MARVIN KOHL Bertrand Russell, in his paper on "Vagueness," claims that all language is vague. His first argument is that language is vague because all words ?physical-object words, logical Avords, proper names, etc.?are vague. Or, to state the argument more fully: a word is vague if it is a word the extent of whose application is essentially doubtful; all words have an extent of application that is essentially doubtful; hence all words are vague. There are several difficulties, most of which result from Russell's use of the phrase 'essentially doubtful'. Physical-object words may be used vaguely. But to say that words may be used vaguely is not the same as saying that they are vague. Similar considerations apply to logical words. Concerning proper names I argue, first, that, given Russell's theory, he cannot consistently maintain that they are vague, and, second, that the evidence he offers is not evidence for the vagueness of proper names but evidence that we are some times in doubt whether or not to give an entity a name. Russell's second argument is that language is a system, and, since the system is vague, the component parts of the system must be vague. He suggests that language ?the language of science as well as the language of daily life?is more or less vague because it is not very accurate and that it is not very accurate because the relation of the representing system to the represented system is not one-one but one-many. The argument has its difficulties. It implies, among other things, that a language can be incomplete in the same way that a map can. More important, it would have us conceive of vagueness in such a way as to guarantee (logically guarantee before any facts come in) that language is vague. Reasons and Causes, R. J. RICHMAN Since 'reason' and 'cause' are practically interchangeable (Melden) and since reasons constitute a set separable from (other) causes (Davidson), one may wonder what is at stake in the dispute over whether reasons are causes of actions. Davidson has presented telling counter-arguments against the claim that reasons cannot be causes, but his arguments that they are are weaker. In any case, if what is at stake in the dispute is the alleged incompatibility of the causation of actions with their being performed freely, then Davidson does not adequately deal with this "incompatibility claim." One of Davidson's arguments seems, moreover, to provide a basis for the claim that reasons are not causes. Even, however, if reasons are not causes, this fact does not help us with the incompatibility claim, but rather raises it anew in an aggravated form. This results from the logical relation between human actions and bodily movements. Are Moral Considerations Always Overriding? HUNTINGTON TERRELL Cases can readily be imagined in which a clearly non-moral (e.g., legal, esthetic, or even personal) reason for doing something would appear to out</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 593 weigh an obvious moral reason against it. This is understandable if we consider that valid moral rules must fairly serve the interests of everyone alike, and that some commonly acknowledged moral rules will do this only if they are taken as allowing exemptions under certain circumstances. Suppose one's keeping a promise would cause so much more incon venience for him than his breaking it would cause anyone else, that any reasonable person would readily accept his breaking it. Though his personal reason for breaking it might then override his moral reason for keeping it, it would still be a merely personal reason. The inconvenience he wants to avoid would hardly be a moral consideration, i.e., something he ought morally to consider in deciding what he ought to do. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. VIII, No. 4: December, 1968 Husserl and/or Wittgenstein, JOHN M. HEMS The author examines recent attempts to conscript Husserl into the Wittgensteinian camp, and casts a cold eye on this "take-over bid." It is argued that the much mooted resemblance between these two philosophers results from a superficial reading, while consideration of their work in depth reveals them as fundamentally divergent both in aim and in method. The author concludes that what Wittgenstein has to offer is a parody of Husserl, in so far as there are any similarities between them. Wittgenstein's Avork constitutes a philosophical travesty?although a significant one. Language, Perception, and Fact, LAURENCE FOSS First, grounds are indicated for distinguishing between observations and interpretation or, in the linguistic mode, between description and explanation. Next the meaning of "observation" (or "description") is pin pointed via what may be called paradigm-induced expectations. Finally, the claim that meaning is a function of shifting use is pressed. These three contentions furnish a basis for formulating a criterion for determining what is factually the case. It turns out that a criterion for factuality is the applicability of a concept. And factual truth is seen for what it is: relative and timely such that "correspondence rules," i.e., bridge statements connect ing members of our descriptive language with those of our explanatory languages, are but "anticipations of definitions" in Sellars' phrase. Though it would be inappropriate to implement these definitions in developing science, their implementation at the "far off end of inquiry" would constitute a unified worldview. An Early Islamic Critic of Aristotelian Logic: Ibn Taimiyyah, C. A. QADIR</page><page sequence="6">594 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS A Survey of Recent Peirce Literature, VINCENT G. POTTER This paper presents a summary of some of the major works on Peirce published over the last ten years. It covers the books by Murphey, Wenner berg, Boler, Haas, Knight, and Fitzgerald. It also gives a synopsis of the studies on Peirce which appear in the second series, Studies in the Philosophy of C. S. Peirce, edited by Moore and Robin, and in Perspectives on Peirce, edited by R. J. Bernstein. The aim is not so much critical as expository and yet a theme has been chosen around which to organize the material?that of the unity and coherence of Peirce's thought. Several of the books surveyed defend Peirce's unity and coherence at least in those areas examined by their authors. The writer of this article sympathizes with this position and has tried to show it to be the case in a book of his own. On the Possibility of Yogic Powers, K. S. JOSHI A regular practice of Yoga is supposed by and large to give rise to supernatural powers, many of which are found described in ancient texts on Yoga, like the Yogasutra of Patanjali. These powers are said to be attainable through what is technically called Samyama in Yoga terminology, which is a state analyzable into three progressively deeper stages of absorption of mind, respectively called dharana, dhyana, and Samadhi. Analyzing these states on the basis of Yoga epistemology, the author has raised two questions, namely, (i) is Samadhi a process of knowledge at all, and (ii) can new knowledge be obtained without the working of sense organs, through mental concentration alone? Answering these in the negative, the author has declared further that a mind in a state of concentration can not be said to be communicating with anything in the external world in the absence of the working of the sense organs, and hence the possibility of Yogic Powers has remained unproved. Contemporary Western Philospohy from an Eastern Standpoint, JOSEPH S. WU As the title indicates, the major task of this article is a critique of contemporary Western philosophy from an Oriental viewpoint. First, the author exposes a subtle trend underlying the Western philosophical tradition as leading to the contemporary situation. This is the spirit of "looking for clarity and certainty." Secondly, owing to this, Western philosophy has been intimately related to the development of science. Thirdly, because of the scientific nature of Western philosophy, Western philosophers, partic ularly contemporary analytic philosophers, emphasize criticism and thus have developed an intolerant attitude. At the same time, American philos ophy scholars are more interested in artificial problems and trivial topics than in the real problems of the society. In the conclusion, the author observes that existentialism may be a new hope. Nevertheless, its future seems overshadowed by phenomenology which is an expression of the typical Western habit of "looking for clarity and certainty."</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 595 Ricceur's Diagnostic Relation, CHARLES E. REAGAN As a result of recent linguistic philosophy, it has become clear that many confusions are a result of using a concept in a language (or context) in which it does not belong. "Naturalism," or the use of naturalistic con cepts in mentalistic languages is the same kind of conceptual error as is anthropomorphism in scientific languages. But if we keep the mentalistic languages separate from the naturalistic ones, are Ave merely substituting a dualism of languages for a dualism of substances? Paul Ricceur answers "no" because there is a relation between the mentalistic (phenomenological) and the scientific (naturalistic) languages; and this relation is the "diag nostic." It is this relation that allows the physician to move from a state ment of "where it hurts" to a purely physiological statement. The diagnostic relation, argues Ricceur, is not a disguised parallelism, nor is it another version of the neural identity theory. Thus, we can avoid many conceptual confu sions by keeping different languages distinct and we avoid the problem of a new dualism by exhibiting the relation which holds between the distinct languages. Reflections on the Iflst Indian Philosophical Congress, ALBERT NAMPIAPARAMBIL Cogency, Conviction, and Coercion, JOHN KING-FARLOW * If one reasonably believes that reasonable disagreement about the existence of God is possible, one must seek to meet heterogeneous claims that only belief or only non-belief is reasonable. Is belief in reasonable disagree ment really reasonable for someone who holds both that God exists and yet that we have no overwhelming evidence to support rational belief in God? Can absence of such very strong evidence itself be weak evidence for theism? Some subsidiary premisses of liberal theists about God's concern to test persons as unique individuals are considered. These indicate that we should answer "Yes." Also discussed are Donald Henze's recent criticisms of John Hick and A. C. Maclntyre on these issues. Some epistemological, logical, and psychological aspects of certain crucial "CO-" words are analyzed. A Metacritique of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, WINFRIED WEIR * The purpose of the article is to show the incompleteness of Kant's own critique. There is an innate thrust in the thought of Kant which should have carried him to further conclusions than it actually did. Thus the assertion of the noumenon as existing and responsible in some way for the determinations of the phenomenon should have led him to some form of ontological realism. The drive of the mind toward unity and intelligibility should have led him to give more objective value to the supreme regulative ideas of self and God. This deeper thrust in his thought was inhibited, however, from full development by his clinging, in spite of himself, to the * This article appeared in Vol. VIII, No. 3: September, 1968.</page><page sequence="8">596 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS very rationalistic and empiricist models of thought he was trying to over come. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. VII, No. 1: January, 1969 Ancient Interpretations of Aristotle's Doctrine of Homonyma, JOHN P. ANTON This paper offers an exposition and a critical examination of the ancient interpretations of Aristotle's doctrine of homonyma as formulated in the Categories. The interpretations discussed are those of Porphyry, Dexippus, Ammonius, Philoponus, Olympiodorus, Simplicius. and Elias. On the basis of the available textual evidence it is shown that the commentators attached to Aristotle's meaning of homonyma views Avhich were alien to his formulation. Detailed analysis discloses how these platonizing interpreters treated in their expositions issues and theories more relevant to their own philosophical concerns than to Aristotle's doctrines. As a result, their treat ment of homonyma is patently non-Aristotelian. The commentators, it is pointed out, failed to see the full import of the expression logos t?s ousias although they preserved it in their editions of the text of the Categories; but more significantly, they extended uncritically the meaning of logos to include the functions of both definition and description. The Neoplatonist Interpretation of Plato: Remarks on its Decisive Charac teristic, R. F. HATHAWAY The question of the historical genesis of Neoplatonism and the question of the decisive characteristic of Neoplatonist exegesis of Plato are two distinct questions. The decisive characteristic of Neoplatonist exegesis is its oblivion to the genuine Socratic element in the dialogues. This is proved by the Neoplatonist claim, against the ancient partisans of a sceptical Plato, that Plato is a dogmatist, with what that entailed, an evasion of the aporetic character of Socratic dialectic, the transformation of the Socratic way of raising the question about virtue into a theological closure of the question, and the assertion of a systematically dogmatic and didactic interpretation of the only cryptically dogmatic and nondidactic dialogues. Confirmation of these points is found in the canonical curriculum of the Neoplatonist Schools. Certain facts about the origin of this canon in the thought of Plotinus and an earlier platonic school tradition are mentioned to clarify the argument. The general habits of Neoplatonic thought, its avoidance of certain dialogues, its tendency to evade thematic questions and subtitles, and its collapsing of thematic questions into over-arching problems are shown to follow naturally from these presuppositions. Ockham on Evidence, Necessity and Intuition, T. K. SCOTT An attempt is made to clarify three concepts widely recognized as basic to Ockham's theory of science. Ockham's use of these concepts to develop</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 597 a view of "induction" as formally valid is explained, and an interpretation of that theory is offered, making use of a notion of ontological kinds. Finally, it is suggested that the three concepts are so related that Ockham can provide no way of justifying empirical knowledge claims. John Locke and Jonathan Edwards: A Reconsideration, PAUL HELM The paper claims that the undoubted influence of Locke on Jonathan Edwards is subject to important qualifications. Edwards' argument in the Freedom of the Will was not just an adaptation of Lockean psychology; it cannot be understood without taking account of Edwards' "theistic para digms" of virtue, which owe nothing to Locke. In the Affections Edwards employs the terminology of Locke's "new way of ideas" to make clear the non-natural character of religious experience, and not, as has been claimed by Perry Miller, to argue that religious experience is "scientifically explicable, empirically verifiable." Edwards uses Locke's philosophy only when this serves his wider aims. Zur Klarstellung einiger Lehren Bernard Bolzanos, I. DAPUNT Very often the thoughts of Bolzano are misunderstood and misrepre sented. The aim of this paper is to clarify some of Bolzano's logico-semantic and ontological theses through discussion of Reinhardt Grossmann's article, "Frege's Ontology" (The Philosophical Review, Vol. LXX, 1961, pp. 23-40). The discussion seeks 1) to discover obscurities in Bolzano's own explanations which Grossmann has apparently not observed; 2) to provide proof of the misinterpretation: owing in part to difficulties of language or translation, Grossmann renders some very clear ideas of Bolzano's inexactly or even wrongly (Bolzano wrote in German, Grossmann in English). However the mistakes due to translation lead to further faults of greater import in Gross mann's representation of Bolzano's ideas. Finally, a critical examination of Bolzano's theses would be especially desirable. But this is not intended in this paper. It is restricted to questions of interpretation and ignores, on purpose, the critical views which take into consideration Bolzano's thoughts which are first to be clarified before criticized. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXV, No. 19: October 3, 1968 Self-reference and Self-awareness, SYDNEY S. SHOEMAKER In the making of many first person statements the use of the word "I" does not involve an identification of its referent and also differs in important respects from demonstrative reference. Statements that are in this way "immune to error through misidentification" cannot be grounded on self perception. These features of self-reference and self-awareness have seemed puzzling to many philosophers, some of whom have been led to hold that in some of its uses "I" does not really refer to anything. But it is involved in the very notion of a psychological predicate that some such predicates be</page><page sequence="10">598 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS such that their self-ascriptions are immu1 ror through misidentifica tion, and unless this sort of self-reference possible other sorts of refer ence would not be possible. Reference and S elf-identification, MICHAEL WOODS Shoemaker's thesis that, in some uses ('when used as subject'), T does not express an identification, is not established by the fact that mis identification is impossible, and that T, unlike 'this', cannot fail of refer ence. For circumstances could arise in which a man was unable to distin guish himself from other things, and in that sense be unable to identify himself. Although T cannot fail of reference, the rules for its use do not determine what is being referred to on every occasion of its use; someone might fail to identify the referent of T even in circumstances such as Shoemaker mentions. General considerations about reference suggest that someone who asserts that 'a is &lt;f&gt;', when 'a' is a genuine referring expression, must know what the reference of 'a' is if he can be held genuinely to be saying of a that it is 0. Three Arguments Concerning the Morality of War, RICHARD WASSERSTROM Three Levels of Meaning, GILBERT HARM AN Three levels in the theory of meaning are distinguished, corresponding to the meaning of thoughts, the meaning of messages, and the meaning of speech acts. It is argued that distinguishing these levels.helps to clarify three well-known approaches to the theory of meaning and reveals certain deficiencies in Katz and Fodor's semantics and in Chomsky's discussion of linguistic competence and of language learning. Vol. LXV, No. 20: October 24, 1968 Some Remarks on Essentialism, RICHARD CARTWRIGHT The Appeal to Tacit Knowledge in Psychological Explanation, JERRY A. FODOR Are Mathematical Truths Synthetic A Priori? JAAKKO HINTIKKA A distinction is made between depth information and surface informa tion and the nature of the latter discussed. Each is defined in terms of a system of probability-like weights on (first-order) sentences. In the case of surface information (unlike depth information), inconsistent (but not in a specifiable sense "trivially inconsistent") sentences can have non-zero weights. All non-trivial deduction involves showing the inconsistency (and hence the dispensability) of some such sentences, thus increasing our surface information. Since these sentences prima facie seemed to represent pos sibilities concerning the world, obtaining such information reduces one's uncertainty concerning objective reality and thus increases one's information about it. However, this information is also obviously essentially conceptual</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 599 (information about our conceptual system). This double nature of surface information illustrates the inextricability of conceptual and empirical factors in our knowledge, thus enabling us to discuss an old idealistic doctrine in modern terms. The Desirability of Fnormalization in Science, PATRICK SUPPES This article presents positive arguments for the desirability of normal ization in science. Some reasons for formalization are briefly surveyed in terms of the virtues of explicitness, standardization, generality, objectivity, self-contained assumptions, and minimal assumptions. Three somewhat detailed examples of how methods of formalization can contribute to the clarification of conceptual problems in science are considered. The first analysis deals with a special theory of relativity, the second with the measure ment of intensive properties, and the third with psycholinguistics. Vol. LXV, No. 21: November 7, 1968 The Argument in the Republic that Justice Pays, GREGORY VLASTOS Collective Responsibility, JOEL FEINBERG This paper is concerned with responsibility for harm in the sense of liability to unfavorable responses from others. Four different patterns are considered. The first, Avhere a Avhole group is held liable even though not all the members were at fault, is reasonable only when certain conditions are satisfied, including prior public notice, control, and de facto group solidarity. The second is liability of a whole group where every member shares the same fault, but only one member's fault leads to any harm, and that not because it was more of a fault than that of the others, but only because of independent fortuities. Thirdly, collective responsibility can be the non-vicarious liability of each and every member where each is contribu torily faulty. Finally, I discuss liabilities of organized groups where the organization was at fault but the fault cannot be ascribed distributively to all or even any of its members. Kant and Kierkegaard on Duty and Inclination, GEORGE SCHRADER Vol. LXV, No. 22: November 21, 1968 Reflections on Ryle's Theory of Knowledge, ISRAEL SCHEFFLER This paper argues that the account of propositional knowledge given in The Concept of Mind is inconsistent, such knowledge being described both as an achievement (i.e., episodic) and as a capacity (i.e., non-episodic). Three remedies for the inconsistency are critically examined and found wanting.</page><page sequence="12">600 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS Knowledge and Belief, RAZIEL ABELSON Sheffler criticizes Ryle's account of knowledge as both a tendency and a capacity and he offers an alternative analysis in terms of theoretical constructs. I argue that Ryle's view is easily strengthened to avoid the anomalies pointed out by Sheffler, and that Sheffler's alternative is obscure. I further argue that both Ryle and Sheffler try mistakenly to provide an ontological classification of knowledge and belief as types of entities, because they overemphasize the third person, descriptive uses of "know" and "believe." I propose that we take the first person, present tense "I know" and "I believe" as fundamental, and consider these expressions as propo sitional modifiers of the kind Urmson has baptized "parenthetical verbs." Thus considered, Ryle would be right in separating knowledge from belief, and Sheffler would be wrong in holding that knoAving entails believing. Vol. LXV, No. 23: December 5, 1968 The Similarity of Discernibles, DOUGLAS GREENLEE The Similarity of Discernibles is the principle that resemblance in one or more respects obtains among any two or more discriminable things. This principle is defended and clarified with an examination of what is to be understood by "discriminable thing," as well as by "property" which a thing may be said to have, and whether the resemblance in question is unique. It is argued that the principle is true, and true necessarily rather than contingently but that it is not therefore trivial. To show the meth odological importance of the principle, Hume's laws of the association of ideas by resemblance and by cause and effect and Peirce's theory of iconic signification are criticized with respect to it. Also a demonstration of the principle by Peirce is evaluated, and in the course of this evaluation the relationship between this principle and that of the Identity of Indiscernibles is indicated. Vol. LXV, No. 24: December 19, 1968 On the Linguistic Foundations of Scientific Discovery, GEORGE L. FARRE In the first part of this paper, I present an analysis of the structure of scientific matters of fact, and of the statements descriptive of them, with a view to better understand the linguistic framework within which the problem of discovery is posed. The principal result of this analysis, from this point of view, is that matters of fact are perspectival, meaning by this that they are partly determined by the way the world is looked at. On the basis of this, two principal types of discovery are recognized, depending on whether it is a matter of fact that is discovered, or the hypothesis that accounts for it. The first type of discovery itself is seen to cover tAvo distinct subtypes, of vastly different import for the development and growth of a science, namely, the discovery of some new kind of fact, and the discovery that something definite is the case. No attempt is made here to describe exhaustively these</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 601 questions, thinking it sufficient to circumscribe the problem which is of recurrent interest to the philosophy of science. MIND Vol. LXXVII, No. 308: October, 1968 Legal Duties, Offences and Sanctions, A. D. WOOZLEY An examination of Hans Kelsen's thesis that legal duties and offences have to be defined in terms of sanctions, viz., as conduct, for the contrary of which, and for which respectively sanctions are required by law. Both his arguments against the opposite view, that sanctions are penalties required by law for conduct already characterized as a legal offence, or as a failure of legal duty, and his arguments for his own view are found to be invalid, and to derive from crucial confusions. Aristotle's Conception of Syllogism, JAMES DUERLINGER On the Connotation and Sense of Proper Names, CHRISTOPHER KIRWAN A Principle About 'About', D. HOLDCROFT Argues that there is no compelling reason to accept the principle [A] : "If a statement expressed by a sentence containing a proper name in subject position is about something if true, then it would also be about something if false." Hence, a theory of proper names which leads to the denial of this principle is consistent with other plausible principles about proper names, and such a theory is at least as defensible as those theories about proper names which accept [A]. A Definition of Memory, E. M. ZEMACH After an examination of N. Malcolm's definition of "Factual Memory" (which is found to be both too wide and too narrow, and hence unable to do justice to the concept of remembering that p), the following definition is offered. S remembers that p iff (1) S believes that p, and (2) if S believes that p then S knoAvs that p, and (3) if S knows that p then S knew that p in the past, and (4) S believes that he knew that p in the past. The "phenom enological" sense of 'remembering' is then defined as believing that one re members that p. Next, the so-called "special kinds of memory," i.e., Personal Memory, Perceptual Memory, Habit Memory, etc. are examined, and it is shown that they can be construed as merely adding, each of them, an additional, fifth condition to the four conditions specified above. Further, it is argued that the very concept of "kinds of memory" is misguided in principle. It is probably due to Hume's vain attempt to distinguish between 'ideas of memory' and 'ideas of the imagination'. But this (often repeated) attempt must fail, since there are no such things as "ideas of memory." To remember is to have certain beliefs; but there are many things which people may do in order to remember. Using their imagination (making up mental pictures) is one of them.</page><page sequence="14">602 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Propositions and Eternal Sentences, CHARLES SAY WARD In this paper I argue that it is not the case that every proposition is expressible by the utterance of an eternal sentence, i.e., a sentence Avhich is such that on any tAvo standard occasions of its utterance the same proposition is expressed. The argument is based on the fact that a speaker S might make an assertion Avhile being unaAvare of various features of the context of his utterance, e.g., the time and place. Due to this lack of knowledge. I argue that no eternal sentence can replace "P" in the schema "S asserted that P." Relevant views set forth by Quine are examined in the course of the discussion. The Seventh Letter of Plato, A. Q. MORTON AND A. D. WINSPEAR * This is an example of a new technique for determining the authenticity and homogeneity of Greek authors. It has been empirically determined by an examination of very many Greek writers that each Avriter has his own skeletal structure of language which continues over a 40 year period, what ever the topic with which the Avriter is dealing. Applying the method to Plato's Seventh Letter we found that the Letter was not consonant with the Platonic style. There is, however, extant a letter attributed to Speusippus, Plato's nephew and head of the Academy after Plato's death. The letter was written to Phillip of Maced?n. Here the skeletal structure language shows an extraordinary consonance with the style of the Seventh Letter. Moreover, there seems a likelihood that the first 300 sentences of the Timaeus, the whole of the Critias and two books of the Laws were either written by, or edited by the same hand. The Seventh Letter does not appear to be homogeneous. There is a break at the so-called "Philosophical Digres sion." From these results a Cumulative Summary Plot Avas prepared. This is a process which is extensively used by industry for the control of automatic processes. This paper is its first application to literature. On the Conception of Polylogic, GEORGE BRUTIAN * At the present stage of the development of logic there are many logical sciences. We can classify them as follows: contentai (e.g., dialectical) and non-contental. The latter may be formal (e.g., traditional, aristotelian) and formalized (e.g., mathematical). The basis of this classification is the degree of abstraction from the content of logical forms. Contentai logic studies forms of thought in dependence on cognitive content; formal logic abstracts from the concrete and particular content of thought; formalized logic abstracts from any content of logical forms. The different logical sciences compose a unified logical system. This fact has its (a) objective and (b) cognitive roots, (a) In the objective process of thinking, formal and informal aspects exist as a unity, (b) Contental-dialectical logic can be considered as a method of other logical sciences. Formalized logic is, in a definite sense, a symbolic model of certain constructions of formal logic. Between some parallel concepts of traditional formal and symbolic logic * This article appeared in Vol. LXXVII, No. 307: July, 1968.</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 603 there is a relation such as that between explicandum and the explicatum, and with the help of the exact criteria of mathematical logic we explicate many concepts of traditional formal logic. Mathematical logic itself, creating its formalized systems, meets with problems which demand for their solution a contentai approach. Unfulfilled Conditionals and the Truth of their Constituents, JONATHAN HARRISON * (1) An unfulfilled conditional statement is true, not, as most philoso phers have supposed, false in the event of its antecedent and its consequent both being true. We ought usually to make such statements, however, only if we believe that their antecedents and their consequents are both false. (2) An unfulfilled conditional statement is false if its antecedent is true and its consequent false. (3) No law-statement or law-like statement is entailed by or is part of the meaning of an unfulfilled conditional statement. Such statements, however, are our only reasons for asserting unfulfilled conditional statements in the event of their antecedents being false. (4) The contra dictory of a hypothetical prediction "If p is true, q will be true" is "If p is true, not-q will be true." Similarly, the contradictory of an unfulfilled conditional 'If p had been true, q would have been true', is 'If p had been true, q would not have been true'. THE MONIST Vol. Lll, No. 4: October, 1968 Equality and Human Rights, W. T. BLACKSTONE Can claims for equality and human rights be justified? The author argues that an answer to this question requires a metaethical analysis of these claims and an elucidation of their linguistic functions. Focusing primarily upon human rights claims, the author argues that a purely descrip tivist account of those claims is mistaken. Human rights are not descriptive properties of men; nor are they directly inferable from such properties. The presuppositions for the meaningful use of human rights talk are multiple. The author's concern is not with these general "significance" conditions but with specifying the various functions performed by rights claims, especially the fact-stating functions, and subsequently the extent to which we can properly speak of such claims as justified or true. The author argues that rights claims are multifunctional, that they state facts which can be verified and further that they can be vindicated or pragmatically justified. Rights, Human and Otherwise, HENRY G. AIKEN Persons and Punishment, HERBERT MORRIS * This article appeared in Vol. LXXVII, No. 307: July, 1968.</page><page sequence="16">604 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS Towards a Theory of Human Rights, MARTIN P. GOLDING This paper proceeds by considering the conditions which must obtain in a universe for "rights-talk," generally, to be significantly employed, and argues that we cannot speak of rights existing anterior to or outside of a community. A distinction between claims and (acts of) claiming is intro duced, and the conditions under which one may be said to have a claim is discussed. It is then argued that the content of the system of rights of a given community depends upon its social ideal, and the relation between types of rights (option rights, which involves freedom, and welfare rights) and the social ideal is treated. Finally, it is maintained that a conception of human rights requires (1) a view of the social ideal and the good life for man and (2) a view of the nature of human community. A Sketch of a Liberal Theory of Fundamental Human Rights, ARNOLD KAUFMAN The Right to Life, HUGO A. BEDAU Contemporary defenders of the right to life evidently are prepared to use it to confront a four-fold variety of questions at best only loosely linked together, viz., questions affecting the termination, the prevention, the pres ervation, and the fulfillment of human life. Legally, however, the right to life exists mainly as "due process of law" in the deprivation of a person's life! Normative, metaethical, and empirical difficulties relevant to this right, whenever it is taken beyond this legal provision, continue to plague all theories of the right to life. The purpose of this paper is to set our current thought about the right to life against an articulation of the background of the classical theory, itself, best expressed in Hobbes, Locke, and especially Sir William Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England (1795), in order to show the major conceptual features of this right and also some of the problems we confront when we acknowledge it as a fixed part of our moral landscape. Skepticism and Human Rights, KAI NIELSEN THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. XLIII, No. 1: Winter, 1969 Intelligible Matter and the Objects of Mathematics in Aristotle, THOMAS C. ANDERSON Neither Heath nor Apostle, in their studies of Aristotle on mathematics, treat the topic of this paper; Thomists tend to read back into Aristotle the view of Aquinas. By concentrating on the most obscure element in Aristotle's remarks on the objects of mathematics, namely intelligible matter, the true nature of the Aristotelian doctrine can be made to emerge. It also becomes clear that there is a gap in Aristotle's explanation, one that later thinkers like Aquinas attempted to fill. Aristotle gives little indication of having a concep</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 605 tion of common intelligible matter in any sense, let alone as present in the essence of mathematical quantities. In his passages dealing with intelligible matter, it is limited to individual mathematicals, as both their parts and their individuating substrate. It seems unquestionable that Aristotle fails to draw out the legitimate conclusions of his own teachings on quantity, on substance and accident, on one essence, when dealing with the nature of the object of mathematics. The Continuity of 'Mens' in Spinoza, LEE C. RICE The three degrees of cognition proposed by Spinoza (imaginatio, ratio, scientia intuitiva), or four, if one reads the Ethick into the Tractatus de intellectus emendatione rather than the converse, represent not a division into distinct epistemic objects (Joachim, Appuhn), or even into distinct cognitive operations (Parkinson, DeDeugd), but rather a possibly overlapping distinction among manners of knowing or degrees of intentionality by a unified knowing thing (res cogitans, mens humana) : hence the term 'continuity'. Philosophies of Nature, ERNAN MCMULLIN Various types of philosophy of nature have to be distinguished before one can decide whether there is an authentic area of philosophical discussion about nature distinct from empirical science and from philosophy of science. A first-order philosophy of nature claims to have a source of insight other than that afforded by natural science; moreover, this insight is in some sense prior to constructions of empirical science and able to pass judgments on empirical science, at least in some respects. A second-order philosophy of nature is one derived from, or at least suggested by, theories of contemporary natural sciences. A mixed philosophy of nature is one that calls upon findings of contemporary science and also explicitly draws upon a broader epistemological or ontological position. Three early modern types of first order philosophy of nature ran into serious difficulties, the Cartesian, the Kantian, and the Hegelian; the first and third tend to become involved in conflict with empirical science while the second takes empirical science too seriously and freezes it at one contingent stage of development into a structure of immutable truths. Current general theories of science, like the general theory of relativity, seem to be a mixed philosophy of nature, as would also contributions by Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schr?dinger. A con temporary second-order philosophy of nature would be Huxley's philosophy of evolution, although an "idealist" evolutionary philosophy of nature would be more a mixed type. Fidelity to dialectical metaphysics forces a first order philosophy of nature on science for Marxists even if harmful to the progress of science.</page><page sequence="18">606 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS NOUS Vol. II, No. 4: November, 1968 Why a Class Cant Change its Members, RICHARD SHARVEY Besides the extensionality of classes, the reason involves an admittedly puzzling principle about time and identity : there are no temporary identities. It cannot be that a thing is identical to something at one time, yet at another time it (that same thing) is not identical to that thing. From a slightly different angle, this principle amounts to a license to substitute "temporary" identities in temporal contexts, when the sentences involved are construed in a de re sense. Many questions arise that are directly analogous to familiar problems about the substitution of contingent identities in modal contexts. At stake is the interpretation of statements containing temporal (or modal) modifiers, as well as traditional metaphysical problems about individuation and identity through time (or possible worlds). Discussing the identity of classes in the context of time brings out some interesting tensions between the extensional and the intentional aspects of time. The Regularity Theory, BERNARD BEROFSKY A regularity theorist must defend the translatability thesis, i.e., the vieAv that laws can be distinguished from non-laws in a truth-functional language, and the thesis of adequacy, i.e., the view that modal operators are not required to account for certain facts or to capture the obvious difference between "must" and "is." A defense of the translatability thesis is presented. Restrictions on predicates are discussed first and certain important limita tions of Goodman's approach are pointed out. To characterize the counter factual sustaining property of laws, laws are systematized and systems are compared. This general 'approach' is old; but the details are new. Two restrictions eliminate systems that contain "too many" axioms and that subsume "unrelated" loAver-order generalizations. Two other restrictions eliminate "superfluous" systems and systems that are not "sufficiently" com prehensive, such eliminations being effected by comparing systems. Disposi tions are then defined in terms of laws. Intentionality and Self in the Tractatus, JAY F. ROSENBERG Wittgenstein's remarks in the Tractatus attempting to reconcile his thesis of extentionality of language with the undeniable intentionality of propositional verbs have remained cryptic and opaque to exegesis. In this paper, I offer an interpretation of Wittgenstein's Tractarian theory of inten tionality. Specifically, I argue: (1) that Wittgenstein did have a solution to the problem of intentionality consistent Avith the balance of the Tractatus; (2) that the solution can only be understood when one has first come to grips with Wittgenstein's notion of a formal relation; and (3) that the solution in terms of formal relations, while ultimately unsatisfactory, is adequate to the criteria of the Tractatus and has the consequences Witt genstein claimed for it with regard to the concept of a self.</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 607 Modality and Reference, RICHMOND H. THOMASON AND ROBERT C. STALNAKER This paper deals with a problem concerning the behavior of referring expressions in modal and intensional contexts. To deal with the problem, we introduce an abstraction operator into first-order modal logic, and present informally the semantic interpretation of formulas involving it. This innova tion allows us to give a formal account of the difference between what have been called the attributive and the referential uses of definite descriptions, and to give a general explanation of the distinction between de dicto and de re modality. After introducing and explaining our semantic machinery, we apply it to some traditional puzzles arising with belief contexts, deontic and tense logic, and counterfactual conditionals. On Abstract Entities in Semantic Analysis, RICHARD M. MARTIN On a Proposed System of Epistemic Logic, R. C. SLEIGH, JR. Y oes on Non-Atomic Systems of Individuals, ROLF A. EBERLE According to Nelson Goodman's well-known principle, items in a sys tem of individuals should be identified if they are generated from the same atoms of the system. The author undertakes to clarify and solve the problem (raised by M. G. Yoes, Jr.) whether this principle of individuation could be suitably extended from atomic to arbitrary systems of individuals. With respect to one generating relation (the ancestral of membership), a principle is stated of which Goodman's is a special case, and whose plausibility is indicated by some theorems which are informally expressed. Finitude and Infinitude in the Atomic Calculus of Individuals, WILFRED HODGES AND DAVID LEWIS Nelson Goodman has raised the question whether there is any sentence in the language of his calculus of individuals which is true in every finite intended model, no matter how large, but false in every infinite atomic intended model. We prove that there is no such sentence. This negative answer to Goodman's question is obtained as a corollary to the following theorem: any sentence in the language is equivalent?under certain axioms which hold in every atomic intended model?to a truth-functional compound of sentences setting lower limits on the number of atomic individuals. "Now" Corrected and Condensed, ARTHUR N. PRIOR PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 19, No. 74: January, 1969 Plato's Paradox That the Immutable is Unknowable, DAVID KEYT In the Sophist (248A-249D) the Eleatic stranger examines the theory of the friends of the Forms, a theory similar to, if not identical with, Plato's</page><page sequence="20">608 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS own theory of Forms; and he presents a little paradox at 248D1-E5, apparent ly in criticism of their theory, to the effect that a Form is changed to the extent that it is known. This paradox has been thought to yield a conclusion about Plato's own theory. One conclusion it has been thought to yield is that Plato's Forms are not completely changeless in all respects (J. M. E. Mo ravcsik, I. M. Crombie, and G. E. L. Owen). I argue that this interpretation of Plato is wrong, that Plato himself never reached such a conclusion. But I go on to argue that this is a conclusion that he ought to have reached. Finally, taking my lead from Aristotle, I distinguish those respects in which a Form must be changeless from one respect in which a Platonist can con cede that a Form changes. Wisdom's Gods, D. Z. PHILLIPS Religious beliefs, Wisdom claims, although not experimental hypoth eses, tell us something about what is the case. They refer to "patterns in human reactions which are well described by saying that we are as if there were hidden within us powers, persons, not ourselves and stronger than our selves." Reference to such patterns shows how religious beliefs are subject to proof and disproof. Five inter-related criticisms of Wisdom are made: no account of religious judgments about the whole of life can be given if belief in God refers to certain human reactions; viewing religious beliefs as hypoth eses cannot account for absolute judgments of value in religion; justifica tions within religion are confused with a general justification of religion; a general justification is sought because of the false assumption that agreement in opinions is necessary to avoid scepticism; the distinction between reasons and causes does not show that moral or religious disagreement is resolvable in principle. Machine Perception, MARGARET A. BODEN The stimulus generalization, conceptualization, and intentionality involved in perception may all be simulated by machines. Machines could extrapolate word-labels to new, physically dissimilar instances of a class and could generate, evaluate, and adjust their own criteria for so doing. Specific programs are discussed, one of which performs the tasks just described, but none of which merit the term "percipient." This term implies the use of perceptual discriminations in the guidance of voluntary action. A truly percipient machine would need to be a motor automaton of a complex sort. The fact that machines are finite-state systems does not preclude their being percipient. Two mutually irreducible forms of explanation are appropriate to machines, referring to mechanism or program respectively. These are analogous to physiological and purposive explanations of behavior. Perception and the Timegap Argument, W. A. SUCHTING The paper discusses the view that it is a consequence of the finiteriess of the speed of light that what we see is never a part of the physical world. One essential premiss of the argument is that for someone to see something it is necessary that what is seen exists simultaneously with the event of seeing it. This can be rejected, and the finite speed of light construed as entailing, not a denial of realism, but rather a temporal illusion, which need not be</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 609 taken to be pervasive. A further premiss of the argument is that light as a physical state of affairs cannot be seen. But there does not seem to be any decisive argument for this, and its rejection constitutes an independent Avay of breaking the time-gap argument. In this case it is a matter of choice whether it is said that what is seen now is light as it is now, or past states of things. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXVII, No. 4: October, 1968 Austin on Locutionary and Illocutionary Acts, JOHN R. SEARLE Berkeley's Attack on Abstract Ideas, E. J. CRAIG The author contends that many commentators have given oversimplified accounts of the passage in the Introduction to the Principles of Human Knowledge in which Berkeley attacked Locke's doctrine of Abstract Ideas. Berkeley gives three descriptions of this doctrine, none of which is equivalent to either of the others, and it is at best doubtful whether he was clear about the differences between them. Furthermore, his objections do not have equal force against all the three versions; and it seems that their force is greatest against the two Avhich Locke, consistently with his general purpose, might happily have discarded, and least against the one which it would have been essential for him to maintain. The Correspondence Hypothesis, BRUCE GOLDBERG PHILOSOPHY Vol. XLIV, No. 167: January, 1969 Moral Pragmatism, G. P. HENDERSON The paper explores the possibility of an a posteriori approach to the elucidation of certain moral notions, principally that of duty. These notions are considered, so far as possible, independently of rules. A duty, in particular, is treated as a function of circumstances and as a special way in which what is to be done presents itself. On this basis a general contrast is developed between "pragmatic" and "regulative" morality. The Necessity of Analytic Truths, D. B. LOCKE This paper first explores and rejects the usual suggestions that analytic truths are trivial and/or verbal and/or conventional. WThence then do they derive their necessity? The author suggests that there is a class of non analytic necessary truths, which are about particular individuals as analytic truths are about kinds or classes. He insists on a distinction between identity and identification, and suggests that these truths have to do with</page><page sequence="22">610 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS the identity of individuals, where analytic truths have to do with the identity of kinds or classes. Such "identifying" truths or statements of individual as opposed to nominal essence owe their necessity to the ways in which we "identity," as opposed to "identify," individuals. Analytic truths are identifying truths about classes, and equally depend on identitying truths about concepts. This accounts for their necessity. Philosophy of History and Historical Research, F. GERALD DOWNING Philosophy of history has been concerned with "historical explanation," most recently with narrative. Even if the "covering law" model is rejected, some objective alternative is proposed, even "very precise and complete description." This confident concentration may be justifiable for the history of recent times. It certainly is not so for earlier periods, where the histo rian's evidence is scarce, and he has to "fill in" and guess. Does this mean that a largely subjective approach to earlier history is inescapable? Common arguments are employed (e.g., for Christian origins, the Avriter's prime con cern). Philosophers of history might well concern themselves more with these; there are only few articles, e.g., Lange on "Silence" and Skinner on "Influence"; the present writer discusses also a "criterion of dissimilarity," unjustifiably used when both terms are ill-known. Perhaps the only method is to compare a great number of plausible presentations. On the Logic of Being a Democrat, MARVIN SCHILLER The central purpose of the paper is to sketch the logic of being a democrat. I proceed by first examining Richard Wollheim's alleged paradox of democratic theory. Wollheim 's solution to the paradox is shown to be unsatisfactory. Next, the concept of being a democrat is clarified. The stage is then set for showing that Wollheim 's alleged paradox of democratic theory dissolves upon discerning what a demorcat qua democrat is committed to believe. In the process of clarifying Avhat is involved in being a democrat and dissolving the alleged paradox of democratic theory, it becomes evident that one popular argument often levelled against resistance to democratic law is without foundation. This is the argument that any democrat who conscientiously disobeys valid democratic law is necessarily behaving in consistently with his democratic principles; and, therefore, if someone does conscientiously disobey valid democratic law, it proves he is not "really" a democrat after all. McTaggart on Time, DAVID H. SANFORD * McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time depends on his argu ment that the A series, which orders events with reference to past, present, and future, involves an inescapable contradiction. In the earlier version (Mind, 1908; Philosophical Studies) McTaggart claims that attempts to explain away the appearance of self-contradiction in the A series involve either a vicious circle or a vicious infinite regress of higher-order A series. This claim is untenable, and he does not make it in the later version (The * This article appeared in Vol. XLIII, No. 166: October, 1968.</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 611 Nature of Existence, Chapter XXXIII) where he argues that such attempts involve a vicious infinite series of moments in the same A series. But this argument is invalid; its conclusion can be rejected without rejecting any of his premisses. And his other arguments which purport to show that the A series is self-contradictory trade on an ambiguity. Since McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time can be refuted without employing any philosophical thesis about time (e.g., without assuming the adequacy of some token-reflexive analysis of tensed statements), no philosophical thesis about time should gain much support from the fact that it can be used to escape McTaggart's conclusion. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIX, No. 1: September, 1968 Induction and Husserl's Theory of Eidetic Variation, DAVID M. LEVIN This paper argues against Husserl's thesis that some of the products of eidetic variation can be articulated in an apodictic evidence. For Husserl, "apodicticity" designates an evidence which is a priori indubitable, and logically necessary. I attempt to show that this phenomenological method is much closer to the typical scientific method of induction than Husserl wanted to think, in the sense that such variation cannot show itself to be absolutely adequate; that is, it cannot show that the possibility of a crucial modification in or a total annulment of the eidetic evidence can truly be ruled out, on the grounds of a finite variation of eidetic compossibilities. On the other hand, the evidential superiority of the products of eidetic method is sustained and given philosophical support. Fiction and Phenomenology, DONALD B. KUSPIT The Role of Imagination in Judgments of Fact, D. C. S. OOSTHUIZEN A Critique of Contemporary American Philosophy, A Plea for Creativity, ARTHUR W. MUNK Four facts about American philosophy are emphasized. The first is its significance during its "golden age" when giants such as Peirce, James, Royce, etc. flourished. The second is the fact of its present decline due to many causes?ranging all the way from the prevalence of a narrow, reductive scientism to the threat to all values posed by the global social and cultural revolution. The third consists of that narrowing of the scope of philosophy that has made it highly abstract, technical, and esoteric. The fourth consti tutes the need of a new creativity capable of taking the lead in producing a new and more adequate Weltanschauung commensurate with the needs of the Nuclear Age.</page><page sequence="24">612 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS The Discernment of Moral Attributes, LOUIS O. KATTSOFF The term "morally good" functions in a moral language based upon the discernment of moral attributes. It is only if the moral language is reduced to either an economic or a sense language, that the term "morally good" is identified with either something like happiness, or some other non cognitive meaning. Moore was right! The analysis of the verb "to discern" shows that moral attributes can be discerned but this discernment involves a precise "fragestellung," a moral stance, and a set of moral categories. Verifiability conditions can then be defined for the resulting discernment statements. Deciding for God?the Bayesian Support of Pascal's Wager, M. B. TURNER Assuming that the infinite gain associated with a correct decision for God outweighs all other gains or losses in the decision manifold, then application of optimal Bayesian decision procedures dictates our deciding for God regardless of the hedonic evidence. However, a problem of in decision arises when we are confronted with the option of choosing among alternative Gods to whom the skeptic must assign equal prior probabilities.
