<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Lost city allegedly found in Montes Azules, Chiapas tuxtla Gutierrez (Cuarto Poder de Tuxtla/Fredy López). Ar chaeologist Luis Alberto Martos has announced the possible discovery of one of the 'lost cities' of the Maya: Sak Tz'i' (White Dog), the name of which is mentioned on stelae in private collections in New York and San Francisco. The ar chaeological site is located on the ejido plan of Ayutla, in the subcommunity of Nueva Palestina, in the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules. According to Martos, the city is larger than Piedras Negras, Lacanja and Yaxchilan. Martos' report describes the site as a political, administra tive and religious centre of significant proportions, made up of three groups of buildings, three plazas, and the largest ball court in the Usumacinta region: it measures 65 m in length, placing it ahead of those in Yaxchilan (25 m), Piedras Negras (25 m), Palenque (40 m) and Tonina (60 m). The investigators have discovered another acropolis with extant walls. There are many plain stelae with indications of large masks. Unfor tunately, there are also clear traces of looting. With the new building found by Martos there are now three acropolises and three plazas integrating the ceremonial area of the site. The archaeologists think that they constitute a classic triad reminiscent of Structures 2 and 3 of the North Group at Palenque, with three access points and inclined planes, according to Martos. The archaeological remains ex tend over 5 hectares and were first reported by archaeologist Peter Smith in 1974. Some 30 archaeologists from the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) are at work on the cleaning and restoration of the site. INAH hopes to incorporate it into the Maya circuit in five or six years, and it will be the first to be opened to the public since 1971, when Yaxchilan was opened up. "It will be something exceptional if it truly is Sak Tz'i'," says Juan Antonio Ferrer, director of the archaeological zones of Palenque, Bonampak and Yaxchilan. According to Ferrer, the new archaeological site will help to reveal some stages in the history of the Maya that up till now have remained unknown. This new find will permit us to leam how the city supported itself and what alliances it formed in order to survive. The importance of the new site lies in its location on the frontier of Yaxchilan's and Piedras Negras' spheres of influence. The glyphic references to Sak Tz'i', according to Ferrer, tell us that it was a political centre of greater importance than Lacanja and Bonampak. One of the things that might be cor roborated is that Sak Tz'i' made war on Bonampak together with Lacanja. When Yaxchilan controlled the region, in a.d. 764, Piedras Negras assumed control of the commerce along the River Usumacinta, although somewhat later Yaxchilan regained control, and Sak Tz'i' caused conflicts with Piedras Negras because Sak Tz'i' had control over the trade route be tween the Guatemalan Peten and the highlands of Chiapas. A polychrome Maya vase from Sacul 1, Peten Graz (Karl Herbert Mayer). The Maya ruins of Sacul 1 are located in the southeastern part of the Guatemalan Department of Peten, close to the western border of Belize. Sacul is famous for its carved stelae, but lacks standing architecture. The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala project, headed by Juan Pedro Laporte, has investigated this site in recent years and has undertaken extensive excavations. In December 1997, Isabel Aguirre, a student of the San Carlos University, Guatemala City, excavated in a field program a burial in a residential group in the northeastern sector of Sacul 1. This burial, numbered 193, contained a human skeleton with inlaid teeth, accompanied by two Late Classic period ceramics, namely a polychrome cylindrical vessel, and a polychrome plate. Burial 193 has been described as follows: "En el Grupo 26, en el pozo frente a la Estructura 1 (Norte), dentro de una cista de 2.10 m de largo y 0.70 m de ancho, Fig. 1.

Cronología: Clásico Tardío" (Laporte et al. 1998). The exquisite, broken cylindrical vessel has been restored anc resides presently in a storeroom of the Atlas Arqueológicc de Guatemala project in Dolores, Peten. The vessel is 25.1 cm high and its diameter is 13 cm at the base, and 14 cm a the top. The paste thickness is 0.5 cm. Although found in ; fragmentary condition, no essential parts of the artifact art missing. The colors used are beige, red, and black. wm m «. »■?» Fig. 2. Vase A-708, representing two seated human figures and glyphic texts (photo: Karl Herbert Mayer, 2003). Unfortunately, some parts of the exterior of the vessel are heavily eroded, but the remaining well-preserved portions are providing substantial clues to the original over-all composition of the design. The exterior decoration consists of three distinct horizontal registers, divided by two double lines in black. The top register encompasses a horizontal glyphic band painted in black, topped by a red frame. The principal register depicts human figures, accompanied by hieroglyphic inscriptions. The lower register consists of a high red, plain band. The main scene in the centre register portrays the protago nist, a seated, bare-breasted young female figure in side view, turned to the left, holding a large rabbit with anthropomorphic features in her hands, also shown in profile and facing left. The figure is seated on a throne, decorated with cosmologi cal symbols, with the so-called "sky band." Underneath the elaborate throne there are vessels with infixed glyphs (Fig. 1). The association of a female figure with a rabbit indicates that the moon goddess is portrayed and that this represents a mythological scene. Comparable goddess-rabbit configura tions are known in ancient Mesoamerica, including the Maya area. Often this female Maya deity with the rabbit is seated in a lunar crescent (Scheie and Miller 1983: 46—47; Scheie and Miller 1986: 55, 308, 314; Taube 1992: 64-67). Concerning Maya painted ceramics, there is, for example, a comparable iconographic image shown on an unprovenanced polychrome ceramic vessel in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massa chusetts (Justin Kerr Photograph 559). To the left of the palace scene with the goddess, there is a scenario depicting in two horizontal registers two human figures, namely two seated male personages, turned to the right, accompanied by vertical and horizontal glyphic texts (Fig. 2).The upper figure wears a large beaded collar, a textile headdress and apparently a bird mask with a large beak. The lower figure depicts an old man whose torso is covered with a turtle carapace; he is ornamented with a beaded collar, a headdress, and wristlets. Christian Prager, University of Bonn, Germany, studied the iconographical and epigraphical aspects of this vase, based on photographs. Prager's (2003) study provides impor tant insights, of which a few aspects will be briefly mentioned here. He states that the hieroglyphic text in the top register is a Primary Standard Sequence, including the Emblem Glyph from the Maya city of Naranjo, Peten, followed by the title sak chuwen, "White Artist," a title referring to wise men, like artists, scribes, intellectuals, and kings. This text sequence closes with the expression wak kab 'an, a toponym occur ring frequently in the inscriptions from Naranjo, particularly within name sequences of rulers from Naranjo. The text pos sibly suggests that the owner of the vase stems from Naranjo or at least from its periphery. The glyphs on the vessels un derneath the elaborate throne of the moon goddess could be read as chih, meaning fermented agave sap, an intoxicating drink. The glyphs to the left of the goddess are pseudo-glyphs. The two male figures to the right of the throne are divided by a horizontally arranged row of glyphs. The upper figure could be a masked personage, or a human body with a bird head. Prager interprets this figure as an itz'at, a wise man, artist, or scribe. The aged figure underneath is characterized by a hook nose, protruding chin, and hollow cheeks. His torso is covered with a turtle carapace. Possibly a Pawahtun god may be portrayed.

Two unpublished relief fragments from Yaxha, Peten Graz (Karl Herbert Mayer). In 1999 two hitherto unpub lished Maya carved limestone fragments were documented in a storeroom of the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH) at the Yaxha camp, in the Department of msm Fig. 3. Yaxha, Fragment 1 (Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer, 1999). Fig. 4. Yaxha, Fragment 2 (Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer, 1999). Peten, Guatemala. The fragments were found in the course of archaeological work by IDAEH personnel in the ruins of Yaxha and removed to its present location. Both fragments show in low relief figural designs, but no hieroglyphs. Al though no subject matter of the representations could be recognized, several details imply that they may be portions of one stela, or two different stelae. So far, at Yaxha the only discovered monument types are stelae and a single carved altar. As the monument type is uncertain, both sculptures have been preliminarily designated simply as "Fragment 1" and "Fragment 2," a nomenclature also employed by Nikolai Grube (2000: 268) in a catalogue of monuments from Yaxha. Fragment 1 is 100 cm high, 50 cm wide, 18 cm thick, and its maximum relief depth is 2 cm. The surface of the bas relief is severely eroded and all edges are broken off. There are some small stone pieces which obviously belong to this fragment. The style of the relief indicates that it is a carving of the Early Classic (Fig. 3). Fragment 2 measures 88 cm in height, 47.5 cm in width, and 13.5 cm in thickness; the maximum relief depth is 2.5 cm. The carved surface is heavily eroded, some portions are cracked or broken off and there exist several very small stone pieces belonging to this main fragment. Stylistically, this sculpture, too, may be assigned to the Early Classic period (Fig. 4).

Gómez C., Morales L., V. Tiesler B., W. J. Folan). Los restos mortuorios desempeñan un papel cru cial en la arqueología al no solo proveer información de orden biológico sino también datos relevantes en la reconstrucción de las costumbres funerarias y otros ritos que involucran el cuerpo humano. En la Mesoamérica prehispánica y colonial cuenta, como máxima expresión del culto, el sacrificio humano que podía ser seguido por diferentes tratamientos postumos del cuerpo, como son el desollamiento, desmem bramiento y descarnamiento. Bajo esta perspectiva adqui eren importancia dos osamentas incompletas que durante la temporada de 2003 fueron recuperados del Grupo 5 y 8 en el sitio de Chakan Putun, actualmente Champotón, ubicado en el estado de Campeche. Las labores se coordinaron por el Centro de Investigaciones Históricas y Sociales de la Uni versidad Autónoma de Campeche bajo la dirección del Dr. William Folan H., en cooperación con la Facultad de Ciencias Antropológicas de la Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán que estaba a cargo del registro osteotafonómico y el estudio de las osamentas producto de las excavaciones. Los esqueletos que datan del Posclásico pertenecen a una muestra total de 30 individuos, recuperados de la Es tructura 1 del Grupo 1 y de los Grupos 5 y 8, todos espacios clasificados como importantes lugares cívico-ceremoniales dentro del asentamiento. Con la notable excepción de dos contextos, de tipo funerario, los restos manifiestan una falta de arreglo, inferido por sus posiciones primarias irregulares que aún conservaban, como también fue el caso en los Entier ros 23 y 29. El primero (Fig. 5) corresponde a un individuo masculino de unos treinta años de edad. Carecía de ambos fémures, aún conservando su posición anatómica las tibias y peronés. El cráneo con mandíbula y la primera vértebra 146 Fig. 5. Dibujo tafonómico, Entierro 23, Champotón. - ii^^z • sjm m i £££. 1 i ""TPY 51150 cm *3 \ ' \ Fig. 6.

Marcas de corte por deslizamineto cubrían porciones del cráneo, tronco y las extremidades (Fig. 6), en tanto que un golpe había sec cionado horizontalmente el esternón (Fig. 7). El Entierro 29, perteneciente a un adolescente masculino, era igualmente perturbado aún preservando su configuración primaria. El cráneo, las clavículas, los omóplatos y un húmero se encon traban igualmente modificados mediante cortes (Fig. 7); el esternón estaba partido en dos mediante un solo tajo llevado desde el frente. Junto con la disposición y la información contextual, la distribución anatómica y las características de las marcas cul turales ponen de manifiesto algunas de las antiguas conductas rituales que involucraban la mutilación postuma del cuerpo mediante desmembramiento, descarriamiento y posiblemente desollamiento. En nuestro caso, éstos asemejan los cánones hasta ahora sólo observados en el Altiplano Mesoamericano de su época (véase, por ejemplo, Pijoan 1997), constatando su adopción también en Champotón en el oeste de la Península del periodo Posclásico. Si bien no podemos concluir sobre la forma de muerte ritual de las víctimas, concluimos que los presentes resultados sobre las prácticas rituales vigentes durante el Posclásico ofrecen una nueva perspectiva de esta región mesoamericana, que continúa siendo relativamente desaprovechada.

Structure I, at Manos Rojas A, Campeche Cleveland (Jack Sulak). Handprints have been a common "signature" device throughout human history and there are many examples of red handprints among the Maya. One of the better examples is Structure I of Group A at the site, appropriately called, "Manos Rojas." It is located near the western edge of the Rio Bee area and was originally called "Kilometre 132." Its GPS location is N18° 31.374' W89° 35.928'. It was first visited and described by Jack Eaton in 1971. The first photos and a brief description were published by David Potter (1977: 101-102, figs. 76-77) and later a description and plan were made by George Andrews (1999: 118: Fig. A46). In 1991, Jack Sulak and others in a group led by Nicholas Hellmuth visited the site - it was visited again in 2001, by Jack Sulak, Karl Herbert Mayer, David Morgan and driver David Salas, again in 2003 by Jack Sulak and driver Riaz Escobedo. Although the building is badly collapsed, a new plan has been drawn, based on George Andrews' original plan, but with many changes (Fig. 8). In Rooms 2 and 4 (lower level) there are areas of excel lently preserved white plaster with very good, red handprints. In Room 2, which is partially collapsed (Fig. 9) there are seven handprints (Fig. 10) and one, badly smeared, possible handprint and, two finger tips at the top edge of a large area where the plaster is broken away, suggesting more prints. All identifiable prints are of the right hand. Room 4 is more col lapsed, and with a higher level of debris. A 1971 photo kindly furnished by Jack Eaton (Fig. 11), shows 19 whole and partial red handprints. Although there are only eight handprints vis ible today (Fig. 12) three of these are not visible in Eaton's photo - for a total of 22. Some of these are only fingers above the debris but of those that can be identified, ten are left hands and nine are of the right. There is a small un-collapsed area at the western end of Room 4, with a pair of handprints (Fig. 13). 522 7ZZZZ/Z&amp; i525i J525252 7Z. Upper Level Fig. 8. Upper apd Lower Levels (plan by Jack Sulak). Fig. 9. Looking NE; Room 2 below (with handprints), and Room 9 directly above it (photo by Jack Sulak, 1991). A right handprint is on the right but the left image appears to be a left and right handprint overlaying each other, so with a total of 25 handprints in Room 4, of those that are identifiable, they are evenly divided between left and right as opposed to all right hands in Room 2. All prints in both rooms are on the north wall of these inner rooms. Excavation of these rooms and Rooms 1 and 3, may reveal more handprints. At present it cannot be known if there are more handprints still hidden in the debris, or if there were still more in the past but now destroyed. Many walls are still hidden by debris and on other walls that are standing and exposed, the plaster surface is badly weathered or completely gone. There is a consider able amount of modern graffiti, and in the lowest part of Room 2, there are two post-contact figures painted in red. The level of debris in the eastern end of Room 2, seems to be almost down to floor level and the handprints appear to have been made at chest level. All the prints in Room 2 used a very wet, red sub stance to print their hands - the images are more 'squeegeed" and smeared and even have drips of the red substance on the lower part of the wall. In Room 4, although the lower part is not visible, all of these prints, seem to be of a different, more viscous sub stance, which has produced sharper images. Since the handprints in the two different rooms are each in a different medium, this may suggest, that they Vol. XXV • Dezember 2003</page><page sequence="6">148 Fig. 10. Handprints at eastern end of Room 2 (photo by Jack Sulak, 2002). were done by different groups, and/or at different times, and it may suggest a pilgrimage site. The building itself is very unusual - at this point, unique. There are the remains of towers at both ends facing outward, rather than forward, as is usual with Rio Bee towered build ings. The only extant structure with this feature is Structure IV at Becan, 14 km to the east. Manos Rojas, Group A, is consid ered "Rio Bee" because the typical horizontal double-bands, that are always found on Rio Bee towers, are found here, at the southwestern corner of the East Tower, where it joins with the molding of the upper zone of Room 3. But curiously, the tower at the west end, shows no evidence of the Rio Bee double-bands to match the East Tower - the extant sides are completely smooth and flat for 2Vi vertical meters. As with the East Tower, at the juncture, there are remains of upper zone molding, from the main building. But unusual again, is that the West Tower was altered and extends farther west by 2.4 meters (as shown by the greater distance between Room 9 and the juncture with the extant molding on the West Tower). Within the collapse there is a cleft that can be seen on the north-side behind the western tower, which may be the result of the remodeling process. The mass of stone fill between the West Tower and Rooms 1 and 9, is unexplained. It extends too far south to allow for Room 1 to have been lengthened so it may have had some other function. Being as Manos Rojas is at the western edge of the Rio Bee area, it reminds one of its corollary, Kohunlich, at the eastern end, which has Rio Bee &lt;m? - m...

Another feature of Rio Bee buildings are the many tunnels or passageways. In this structure, as the plan shows, there is a narrow passageway from Room 8, using unusual wooden lintels (Fig. 14) that moves south, then east, and north, and finally turns west (visible in 1991). Jack Eaton reports (per sonal communication, 2003 and original drawing, 1971) that in 1971, it continued with a steeply ascending stairway, approx. 45 , that likely lead up to the roof of Room 8. In symmetrically matching Room 6, although the vault-spring is visible the room is so filled with debris that the expected passageway cannot be seen, but has been inferred in the plan. Within both towers there is evidence of corbeling to suggest a passageway in each tower — a small part of one is still extant in the West Tower. Most unusual, for Rio Bee and other Maya areas, is that upper level Rooms, 9 and 11 are constructed directly above their respective rooms of the lower level: Rooms 2 and 4 (Figs. 8 and 9). The most notable exception is the Palace at Santa Rosa Xtampak 140 km to the north which has an amazing, ten room-above-room situations, on three levels. In Maya architecture the general plan is always of the "Wed ding Cake" variety, where upper rooms are stepped back from lower rooms and built over a solid base. The Five Story Palace at Etzna is the most famous example. The upper rooms are slightly longer than the lower ones (Room 9 is 1 m longer than Room 2) which allows the end-walls of the upper rooms to extend over the solid base. Fig. 13. Handprints at western end of Room 4 (photo by Jack Sulak, 2003). mexicon • Vol. XXV • Dezember 2003</page><page sequence="7">The upper central room (Room 10) is badly collapsed and even the doorway is not visible. But it faces south toward the main stairway and possibly a Monster-Mouth Doorway, as in Structure IV, at Becan and the Palace at Santa Rosa Xtampak, but at this point only a small squarish pillar is identifiable. Room 12 opens to the north and faces onto a possible large flat area (or "terrace" as Eaton referred to it) - the roofs of Rooms 5, 6, 7 and 8 (or just 5 and 7 if there were rooms above 6 and 8, a possibility suggested by Eaton). On the 1991 visit, Nicholas Hellmuth pointed out the bases of two square pillars for Room 12, which would have opened it on to this "terrace" area. Jack Eaton reports that at the time of the construction of the Chetumal to Escárcega highway (late 1960's) the highway crews were exploring the nearby unguarded sites with dyna mite. This may explain the almost total lack of architectural stone decoration to be found, as opposed to the, near-by (1 km away) Manos Rojas, Group C, which has abundant sculpted stone. This may be the reason for the large hemispherical opening, unlike any "normal" looter's trench, on the south side where the likely, main stairway would have been. This will be a very interesting building to excavate. References Andrews, George F. 1987a Site: Manos Rojas, Group A. Manuscript.
