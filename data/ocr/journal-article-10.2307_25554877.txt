<plain_text><page sequence="1">IH ARTS ^^^^H Young persons' pictures JOHN O'FARRELL previews what's on offer at the award winning Cinemagic film festival for young people. At was Orson Welles who coined that cliche about film-making being the greatest train set a boy could play with. Unfortunately, the act of watching too many films these days is akin to being forced to stare passively at some spoilt brat, playing away with his Hornby set, who won't let you join in the fun. If that's the way adults have to consume (particu larly debut) films, what do the kiddies get out of going to the flicks? Or do the Nintendo addicts ever get away from their consoles to sit in a darkened room with a group of strangers in front of a screen with no interactive controls? Is cinema too passive an entertainment for children whose minds, sup- k\ I posedly, have been colonised by a two-inch-tall ff^B plumber called Mario? |jj i These questions arise as a glut of kids' cin- ||||| ema comes to Belfast with Cinemagic (Decern- jgjl| ber 2nd-l 7th), a festival of movies and related ^CZ events from the Northern Ireland Film Coun- " cil, running at the MGM on Dublin Road, B Belfast, and in Armagh, Ballymena, Bangor, ip?i Garrison, Lurgan, Magherafelt and Omagh. ^m The Cinemagic organisers are still glowing flH| after scooping the first National Award for *9l __ Children's Programming from the British Film ^BB Institute, not to mention the 12,000 child and mvm childlike punters who attended last year. This jjj| j year, they have garnered a collection of films to |?lp see, moviemakers to meet, television program- mm \ mers to confront and competitions to enter. B^l Present at the fun-and-games will be a host of international directors dying to talk about their usually-dismissed genre. Making films with children in mind, and on screen, tends to get contemptuous snorts from the big boys and girls of independent cinema, who feel cinema should be a vehicle for exploring the place of the individual in patriarchal, capitalist society (usually with a slo-mo decapitation in a cellar full of Roger Corman posters). Working with kids on a film can only be as awful as working with screenwriters, producers or (supposedly) grown up thesps. The trick is to escape the knavish tricks of po-mo 'narrative devices', crap visual puns and se quel-friendly open endings, and instead tell a story with a beginning, middle and end, necessarily in that order. These are artists that do not get the recogni tion they deserve, and their presence at the festival is one for applause. Teenage prospective thesps have an opportunity to attend acting masterclasses by such luminaries as Gerard McSorley, Pete Postlewaite and Ralph Fiennes. Would-be animators get the chance for a seven-day masterclass in Omagh with Alistair Mcllwain, one of Europe's most innovative practi doners of this craft. Films range from award-winning features to wee small shorts from around the globe. There is a handful of revivals for the sake of the grown-ups who want to enchant/bore their kids with lessons on how films used to be in the dark ages includes the en chanting Red Balloon, Disney's singalonga Snow White, the strangely psychedelic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the surreally Oirish Darby O'Gill and the Litde People, which is only as twee as, say, Broken Harvest. As one would expect, there will be lotsa JTC cutesie animals doing their anthropomor II P phic thing in Dragonworld, The Very Hungry U Caterpillar, The Cats Mill, Andre (a seal) and a very expensively remade Black Beauty. Magic III iiiiigi and Mystery rear their joined heads in The iBB!m.ii Return of Tommy Tricker, The Pagemaster IliiBllillll and John Sayles' The Secret of Roan Inis, ? which was shot in Co Donegal?for those who choose their movies for purely parochial reasons. ^j^p^p Kids-in-peril flicks include Karakum, aMatusalem, Crows and The Slingshot, while social issues are peeped at in Unsafe Ground (racism) Joey's Christmas (unemployment), ? 111 Charlie and Louise (divorce), Into the Abyss rdaisr (homelessness) and Beyond the Sky (spots). Ill Where children's cinema really excels is |j|[| with animation. Snow White is still, after al most 60 years, one of the most complete cinematic experiences available to man (and boy and girl). The Simpsons, ostensibly a kids' show, is the sharpest and most sophisticated sitcom since Bilko, with its perfect blend of slapstick, script and satire. This festival has features and shorts that are well up to scratch. Manipulation is six minutes of mayhem as the cartoonist loses control. This is being shown as support to Once Upon a Time, a dark triptych of Norwegian folk tales. Local animation is provided by Derry's Nerve Centre with its half-hour epic about that soldier of the UDA, Cu Chulainn. Two absolutely unmissable short films are Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit mini-epics, A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers, as seen on TV but best on a big screen. Action, slapstick, anthropomorphic uncute animals, science fiction, train crashes, tech nology and a wacky array of post-modern devices. There is also a teachers' guide for these films and six others on show over the festival, just to spoil the fun (only joking). Contact Chris McFerran at NIFC, 01232-232444. That leaves one problem. Finding a child to take one to the pictures and pay for one's ice-cream. ^ 42 Fortnight December 1994</page></plain_text>
