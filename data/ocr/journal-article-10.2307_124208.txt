Submission by 5 May 1982 for publication in February 1983* Editorial policy is to commission a number of articles to form the core of each issue, but also to leave some space for unsolicited papers relevant to the theme. The issues marked with an asterisk in the above list are still in the planning stage, and contributions are invited. Intending contributors should note, however, that each issue is made up six months before publication date and that the editor in charge normally begins planning about eighteen months before publication date. Last-minute contributions can occasionally be fitted in, especially if such papers are short, but anyone intending to submit an uncommissioned article is strongly advised to write to the editor of the issue concerned as far ahead as possible, to establish whether space is likely to be available and whether the subject matter is appropriate. Articles which are not related to any announced theme can occasionally be accepted. All such 'non-thematic' manuscripts should be sent to the Executive Editor. In this case a pre- liminary letter is not strictly necessary, though it might save the author time and trouble. For further details, see the Notes to Contributors at the end of this number. It is not current editorial policy to publish book reviews as a regular feature of the journal. Review articles will cover recent publications in particular fields, and lists of books received will be published from time to time.</page><page sequence="4">Miscellany Contents page 1 Concepts of resource exploitation: continuity and discontinuity in palaeoeconomy G.
