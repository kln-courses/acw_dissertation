[ISBN 978-0-13-705826-6. 462 pages, including index. US$49.99 (softcover).] Whether you need an off-the- shelf style guide or are just looking for a starting point from which to produce your own in-house guide, Read Me First! A Style Guide for the Computer Industry is sure to meet your needs. In the years since its first publication in 1 996, Read Me First ! has established itself as a standard reference in the industry. Now, with the release of the third edition, it has grown in both size and usefulness. Like previous editions, the third edition has won praise from luminaries in the field. JoAnn Hackos recommends it for those who "need to understand the best practices for developing useful and usable text," while usability guru Jakob Nielsen has said it is "clear, consistent, and presents advanced topics in an actionable and approachable manner" (back cover). Read Me First! contains all of the standard features one would expect. It is an excellent reference for the basic mechanics of writing. It provides good advice on organizing and constructing text and choosing an appropriate writing style, and it includes discussions of the special considerations for online writing and for writing for an international audience. It covers constructing links; writing tasks, procedures, and steps; writing glossary entries; indexing; and so on. At 462 pages, the third edition is more than 100 pages longer that the second edition (2003; reviewed in the February 2004 issue of Technical Communication). Changes and improvements have been made throughout. The list of terms commonly looked up for meaning and usage has been greatly expanded. The section on handling numbers and numerals has been expanded and placed in a table; the section on typographic conventions has been expanded and moved to an appendix. A new table gives the names and meanings of common symbols. New tables have been added listing anthropomorphism and common Volume 58, Number 1, February 201 1 • Technical Communication 71</page><page sequence="2">^^1~BoõÍ71^eviews idioms and colloquialisms to avoid because they cause confusion, with suggested alternatives. The guide contains new chapters to help you keep pace with an ever-evolving industry. For example, a chapter on structuring information discusses various strategies for organizing information and gives guidelines for their use. A new chapter helps you meet Section 508 accessibility requirements. (Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act specifies that all electronic and information technology used by the federal government must employ assistive technologies to help those with sight and hearing impairments. Many companies have adopted the requirements as well.) One of the key techniques for meeting these requirements is to write alternative text for non-text elements. The chapter gives general guidelines for writing such text, including how much to include based on context. It also discusses special situations such as describing simple graphics such as symbols, logos, and icons; complex graphics such as screen captures and technical illustrations; diagrams such as flow charts; mathematical equations; and multimedia content. Another new chapter discusses creating screencasts, which are digital recordings of computer screen output presented as video, often with audio narration. The chapter walks you through the entire process from creating a storyboard, to writing and recording narration, to managing the review process, to deploying the final screencast. The editors now include a chapter that addresses the rising interest in using wikis for documentation. (The chapter warns that the determination as to whether a wiki is appropriate to your purpose or audience is outside its scope.) For those considering using a wiki, it discusses wikis and collaboration, the value of having prior publications expertise, and organizational and navigational guidelines. It also includes guidelines for wiki writing, wiki terminology, and wiki visual design. An appendix on developing a publications department covers everything from forming your team to developing schedules, to managing the entire documentation process (including managing reviews), to printing and publication, to postproduction considerations. To help with administration, the editors include common publication forms and checklists. The recommended reading list and suggestions for additional resources have been thoroughly expanded and updated. 72 Technical Communication • Volume 58, Number 1, February 201 1 Summing up, this new edition is comprehensive, easy to use, and deserving of a place on the desk of anyone serious about best practices in the industry.
