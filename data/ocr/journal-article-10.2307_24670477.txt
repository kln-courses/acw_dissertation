ISBN 978-90-429-2038-5. This volume contains the proceedings of the Specialists' Symposium on the Septu agintagint Translation (2006), organized by Centre for Septuagint Studies and Textual Criticism Criticism (Leuven) as part of a cooperation project between Stellenbosch and Leuven. Its aim was to survey contemporary research within the realm of the translations of the Septuagint. Therefore, the most important Septuagint transla tion projects (BA, LXX.D, NETS) were confronted with each other, from the perspective of their objective and methodology as well as with regard to their concrete application in particular cases or examples. The carefully edited volume has a surveying and retrospective slant, and its articles differ markedly in both length and quality. J. Cook, "Translating the Septuagint: Some Methodological Considerations," first surveys recent theories about the Letter ofAristeas, and then discusses NETS and LXX.D. He ends with the "translation technique" of LXX Proverbs. R. Sollamo, "Translation Technique as a Method," offers an overview of the theoretical principles and method of the Helsinki school. It is a concise paper with sound methodology. H. Ausloos and B. Lemmelijn, "Rendering Love: Hapax legomena and the Characterisation of the Translation Technique of Song of Songs," claim that the "contextual," "faithful" and meaningful renderings of hapax legomena are a proof that the translator "is not as literalistic or 'slavish' as he has often been character ised" (46). The authors are clearly eager to acquit "their" translator of the burden of "slavishness" (an epithet which is indeed useless in descriptive research). But their own contribution leaves me wondering whether they have proven their case. Hapax Hapax legomena are by definition borderline cases, and that a translator tries to make contextual sense of them and gives a meaningful rendering, and only as a last resort offers a transliteration, is just what any translator would do. Borderline cases are not indicative of the translators normal style. This becomes clear in 2:11,2:11, where the authors claim that the "meaningful rendering" of one word rids the translator of the label "literaliscic," where the verse as a whole is Hebraistic. The authors depart from a one-dimensional understanding of literalism, instead © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 DOI: 10.1163/157006310X503649</page><page sequence="2">Review of Books / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 366-438 367 of using Barrs typology. Another questionable assumption is that a "translator aiming at an understandable text" cannot be a literal translator (who gives "a lit eral rendering of enigmatic words", 59). Why not?, I would ask. The real prob lem is that the authors do not define "literal" and "free." Seen in this light, the conclusion that the translator is "relatively 'free'" (!) reveals more about the authors than about the translator. G. Dorival, " 'La Bible d'Alexandrie': Which Changes?," narrates how the BA project was started and progressed, explains its principles and shows how the BA approach has slightly changed. Because research has expanded so much, BA takes more notice of, e.g., Qumran data and rabbinic material. K. Hauspie, "Ezek 1—Approach by Theodoret of Cyr. Notes on Ezekiel's Vision of the Throne-Chariot," shows how Theodoret of Cyrus explained the first chapter of LXX-Ezekiel. This paper is "preparatory to the notes of Ezek 1 for the Ezekiel [BA] volume." C. Dogniez, "Some Similarities Between the Septuagint and the Targum of Zechariah," distinguishes herself from other contributors in the recognition that literalism is a multi-faceted phenomenon, and that a literal approach can go hand in hand with "free" elements, as it does in Targums. She first describes differences between the Greek and Aramaic translations of Zech (expressions used for God, handling of anthropomorphism, position of Israel, glosses and paraphrases, imagery, moral interpretations, Messianism). She then turns to the similarities ("converse" [= opposite] translations for doctrinal reasons, similar interpretations, change of images, softening of improper expressions). She explains the situation with an appeal to the different functions of the translations: the targums func tioned side by side with the Hebrew text, and the Septuagint as an independent text. The similarities do not prove dependence. M. Karrer, "Septuaginta Deutsch (LXX.D): Characteristics of the German Translation Project," gives exactly what it promises. W. Kraus, "Septuaginta Deutsch (LXX.D)—Issues and Challenges," posits LXX.D vis-a-vis BA and NETS and then studies Psalm 94 (MT 95) in its relation to the Hebrew original. He concludes that "the translator interpreted the whole of Ps 94 LXX as a liturgy of penitence and intensified the connection of Ps 94 LXX to Num 14" (128). The translation had no ancillary role, but addressed the new reading community. At the end, Ps 94 LXX.D is printed with notes. E. Bons, "Translating and Annotating Ps 72 LXX," again outlines the princi pies of LXX.D and draws attention to peculiarities of the Greek translation of Psalm 73 MT. Must the Vorlage (or its popular interpretation) be considered in the case of the hapax άνάνευσις (4) and ύπόλαμβάνω (16)? After elucidating the LXX.D principles for the commentary, B. summarizes what the translator is doing: by using his own keywords he creates a text with its own structure and a somewhat different message. The wicked are depicted not as foolish or ignorant, but as wilful sinners. B. concludes that Ps 72 LXX is not a literal translation, but</page><page sequence="3">368 Review of Books / Journalfor the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 366-438 "rather free." As in other contributions, "literal and free" are not defined and appear exclusively in connection with content words to the exclusion of syntax. At the end, Ps 72 LXX.D is printed with notes. H.-J. Fabry, "The Lord over Mighty Waters," notes that the LXX translator has introduced the phrase "Lord over mighty waters" in Nah 1:12 (and somewhat similarly also in Zech 9:10), where MT has something different. The phrase reminds of Ps 29 and Canaanite imagery. The translators revived the anti Canaanite polemic on purpose. After a comparison of Nah 1 and Hab 3 in MT and LXX, F. concludes that the translator considered himself a prophetic Fort schreiberschreiber of the text in an era of struggle against Hellenistic polytheism. The authors rash claims sometimes go at the expense of sound method (e.g. on 159). A. Pietersma, "Translating a Translation: With Examples from the Greek Psal ter," looks back on the NETS project and its principles. D. Buchner, "You Shall not Give of your Seed to Serve an Archoir. Lev 18,21 in the Septuagint," gives a nuanced treatment of the literature on this verse, and concludes that the translator did not render a different Vorlage (לעבד), but trans lated MT ambiguously. The outcome could be understood either to forbid sexual activity (seed = semen) in cultic service or to criticize Jews who involved their children (seed = offspring) too closely with the Ptolemies or even "in Dionysiac initiation rites for the purpose of social advancement. (...) It is unlikely that we have have in άρχων a divine name of some sort (...)" (196). C. Boyd-Taylor, "Who is Afraid of Verlegenheitsiibersetzungen?" deals with unintelligible renderings in the Septuagint. He argues that such renderings become understandable when the Hebrew source text is consulted, and also that the reasons behind them are not ignorance or carelessness, but conscious transla tion strategy. With help of insights from translation studies, he argues that the translator operated from a set of expectations he shared with his audience. Boyd Taylor also suggests that the text-linguistic make-up of the LXX is a direct result of its intended function. A thought-provoking article. H. Van Rooy, "Agreement between LXX and Peshitta versus MT in Ezekiel: Some Important Examples," suggests that the Peshitta is generally an independent translation of a Hebrew text. Agreements with LXX are probably not due to LXX influence, but reflect the Vorlage, which represents the same tradition as MT, but with a better text. The author illustrates this by citing numerous examples from Ezek 1-5, but so concisely that the article is hardly readable for outsiders. J. Naude, "It's all Greek: The Septuagint and Recent Developments in Transla tion Studies," purports to be a survey of recent developments in translation stud ies that are potentially worthwhile to LXX scholars. Though it contains excellent passages, it could have gained in clarity and credibility with a clearer framework and better references. Since N. mentions no introductory literature, one wonders where the "survey" is based on. Important approaches (process-oriented research, relevance theory) are missing. Under "Descriptive Approaches" we are treated</page><page sequence="4">Review of Books / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 366-438 369 with "postcolonial translation theory" instead of Toury's work, and the "herme neutical approach" is equated with what G. Steiner wrote back in 1975· The sec tion "The Nature of Bible Translation" offers, instead of what it promises, an idiosyncratic partition of history into four great ages (from 200 B.C.E. until now). When N. turns to sacred texts, he theorizes freely but ignores what transla tion studies has done with respect to sacred texts (e.g. Simms, Translating Sensi tivetive Texts). The same pick-and-choose approach taunts the concluding paragraph, where N.'s insights are applied to the LXX. A. Piquer, P. Torijano, and J. Trebolle Barrera, "Septuagint Versions, Greek Recensions and Hebrew Editions: The Text-Critical Evaluation of the Old Latin, Armenian and Georgian Versions in III-IV Regnorum," present a 12-column polyglot edition of 3-4 Kingdoms. The proto-Lucianic stratum in these books is the earliest attainable level of the text. The Vetus Latina, Armenian and Geor gian versions (in their most original mss.) go back to a pre-L text and are impor tant witnesses to it, a claim which is supported with well-chosen examples. The autors also review the value of the secondary versions for books that have a dou ble text (Joshua, Judges, Esther etc.) in relationship to revisions of LXX and even successive editions of the Hebrew text. My only criticism of this great piece of scholarship is its tendency to quote older literature and to ignore more recent contributions. N. Fernandez Marcos concisely outlines the principles of "A New Spanish Translation of the Septuagint." My reviewer's judgement of this volume is: a tree with fruits in different stages of ripeness.
