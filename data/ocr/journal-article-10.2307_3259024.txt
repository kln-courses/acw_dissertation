<plain_text><page sequence="1">54 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE A Study of the Assyro-Babylonian Words relat- ing to Sacrifice J. DYNELEY PRINCE, PH.D. THE principle of sacrifice was in its inception purely anthropomorphic in character, being nothing more than the desire to placate or thank a divinity by feeding or giving him to drink, and at the same time to commune with the gods in the sacrificial meal. That such an idea was the chief basis of the primitive Semitic sacrificial conceptions has been already shown by Robertson Smith (Encyclopcedia Britannica, 9th edition, s.v. "Sacrifice "). Professor Morris Jastrow, Jr., in his Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, 660 if., has ably elaborated the developments which naturally arose from this primitive ideal, and has shown how the ultimate establishment of a sacrificial cult resulted in changing the earlier system of freewill sacrifices into a means of temple-income, whereby the representatives of the godhead, viz., the priesthood, received the lion's share. It should be stated here that the English meaning attached to the word " sacrifice," implying an unpleasant surrender of the necessaries or luxuries of life, is entirely foreign to the original intention of the word. As D. G. Brinton has pointed out (Religions of Primitive Peoples, 186), the sacri- fice was at first a purely freewill offering in recognition of the power of the deity. This offering later became a regular gift exacted by the priesthood and, in this manner, the word obtained its present commonly accepted sense in modern languages. As will appear below, the Hebrews were careful to distinguish between the freewill and the regular ritual offerings. The Hebrew words for sacrifice are as follows: l.H.I 'any kind of offering'; a general word, probably cognate with Ar. dnis' be associated with,' i.e. an associa- tion with the godhead.</page><page sequence="2">PRINCE: ASSYRO-BABYLONIAN WORDS 55 g.M usually 'the slain sacrifice'; but also used of the bloodless offering (Robertson Smith, Sem. i. 205). ='N. ' the distinctively priestly offering.' MM.; also a general word, possibly from M!7 'lead up, present' (scil. 'an offering'). 'Tt' ' freewill offering,' as distinct from the regular neces- sary ritual offering. The Assyro-Babylonian word for this was nidbu, q.v. below, but their nidabd-nindabd, although from the stem 1'I ' be willing,' had quite lost this special sense. 'I 'a promised offering.' The result of a vow. .M. only Deut. 32 38s 'libation.' .I 'libation,' passim. "t17 only Jer. 44 21: ' sacrificial smoke'; incense. 1ltj common word for 'smoke of sacrifice'; then 'in- cense,' which was a later development from the smoke arising from a burnt offering. t=1 general word for offering. Cf. Glossary, s.v. kur- bannu, kirbannu, although from a different stem. 711M ' the regular daily sacrifice,' surviving in the Catholic idea of the Mass, = Assyr. gina, nidabd, sattukku, taklimu (see Glossary). ~.~=~1 primarily 'an offering presented in the hand; wave offering.' Then a general word for 'tribute, tithes,' etc. It is a curious fact that although the Hebrews, and proba- bly also the Assyro-Babylonians, had developed an elaborate system of various sorts of offerings, the vocabulary in both languages is not always distinctive to denote these different rites. Thus, even the most pregnant Hebrew word for sacri- fice T7!' 'slain offering' could also, though rarely, mean any sacrifice at all. The Assyro-Babylonian equivalent zib2 (q.v. below), although from a verb za6d meaning primitively 'slaughter,' did not signify distinctively a slaughtered sacri- fice. Such vagueness of word-picturing is probably not to be attributed to any lack of distinction between the various rites, but rather to the natural unclear Semitic method of expression, peculiar, for example, in another instance to the</page><page sequence="3">56 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE syntax of these languages. It will be evident, therefore, owing to this very vagueness, that a more certain knowledge regarding these sacrificial rites can only be obtained by a more extended study of ritual texts. Context in this investi- gation is really more important than philology. It will be noted, furthermore, from the Glossary that the Assyro-Babylonians had a number of distinctive words refer- ring to libation which, as among the Hebrews, played a most prominent part in their system. In fact, the usual ideogram for priest = ang4 (q.v.) denoted primarily ' the libator.' I am strongly inclined to see in this rite not merely the un- doubtedly ancient custom of giving the divinity to drink, a parallel to the divine food of the solid offering, but also a survival of the idea that liquid in itself typified generation = the semen hominis. See my Materials,' 2 if. s.v. the water- sign A, which was commonly used to signify generation in all its aspects. The object of the following Glossary is to present a brief philological study of the chief Assyro-Babylonian words re- lating to sacrificial methods, paying especial attention to the Sumerian and ideographic equivalents. GLOSSARY ADAGuTRU ' censer, incense-pan '; ideograms: DUK-A-DA-GUR, Br. 11554, which signs seem to indicate the true pronunciation. See Jensen, Kosm., 438 and KB. vi. 1, 501 if. on Assyrian adagaru, which is evidently a Sumerian loanword. In Sumerian, adagur must mean primarily ' vessel for liquid'; viz., a ' water, liquid' + da = the postposition ' for' +gur = GUR = Idkiru ' drinking vessel' (see Hwb. 661). The use of adagur = adagiru to denote a censer is therefore a later innovation. Adagaru is a synonym of stitum, q.v. and see Prince,1 18. AsLu 'sacrificial lamb' (thus Muss-Arnolt,2 15, but Del. Hwb. 36 azlu). The form azlu is probably another and more correct writing for aslu. Note Assyr. uzalu 'gazelle'; Ar. gazdl. Zimmern, Ritualtafeln, 216, 26 if., translates aslu as 'an old wild ram' and puxadt (q.v.) as 'a young wild ram.' 1 J. D. Prince, Materials for a Sumerian Lezicon, Parts I and II, 1905- 1906 (Leipzig). Referred to in this paper as " Prince." 2 W. Muss-Arnolt, A Concise Dictionary of the Assyrian Language.</page><page sequence="4">PRINCE: ASSYRO-BABYLONIAN WORDS 57 ECENu 'inhale, smell'; especially used with qutrinnu 'incense,' IV. 19, 57-58 a (see qutrinnu and Cenu). This ee^nu is, curiously enough, represented by the Sumerian word xar = XAR (Zb. 98), which means ' bind' and is properly applied only to the other eCegnu 'back-bone'= Hebr. MP. Ee^nu 'smell, inhale' could only have been regarded as equivalent to xar = XAR by an erroneous association with eCenu 'back- bone' (see Prince, 174-175). URIGALLU 'a libating priest,' IV. 40, nr. 1, 2 a (see Hwb. 128). In Sumerian, from which urigallu is plainly a loanword, urugal means ' the great (gal) man' (uru); i.e., 'the priest,' by special application. The ideogram SES-GAL=Sum. urugal=Sem. urigallu means 'the elder brother.' Note also the Semitic abstract formation urigallhtu ' function of an urigallu.' AxIPU 'conjuror' (also ilipu); Hebr. ef_4, from asdpu 'divine,' seems to mean only 'diviner.' IHIPU, syn. of aiipu, q.v. just above. irrPPU ' sacrificial priest'; syn. of ramku ' libator,' q.v. The word igippu is undoubtedly of Semitic origin, in spite of the Sumerian punning equivalent i-fib (= ME), where the i- is merely the defining prefix and me = ME = zikaru 'man,' i.e., ' the man par excellence,' hence 'the priest.' This igib in Sumerian must have been suggested by the stem asdpu 'con- jure.' From Sum. ivib then came Semitic igippu secondarily, like Sem. gina^ from Sum. gi-na, itself suggested by Sem. lknu 'be firm.' See s.v. ginf, and Prince, 194. Note also the Sem. abstract formation ilippatu 'function of being an igippu.' BARU 'seer'; especially one who investigated (= bara) the liver of an animal for purposes of divination. See ?abra. BAZILLUM sort of sacrificial goat. Pognon, Wadi-Brissa = Ar. bazlun. See s.v. PASIL(L)UM. BIRSIDU is a Sumerian loanword in Assyrian, synonymous with namxaru 'sacrificial receptacle,' q.v. See II. 22, 27de: DUK-BIR-SI-DI = xubfru, also 'a receptacle.' Bir in the connection bir-si-di may be a variant of bur 'a vessel,' as in the following bursaggu, in which case, birsidi would mean ' the just or proper ritual vessel.' If, however, bir in birsidi can be associated with bar = BAR 'divide, apportion,' then birsidi would mean 'the correct (sidi) divider' (bar)='the proper ritual graduating glass.' See Prince, 60. BURSAGGU 'libation'; only Scheil, Salm. 103 (Muss-Arnolt, 193). This word, which is clearly Sumerian, can only mean 'the excellent or chief (sag) vessel' (bur). It must then refer primarily to the libation- vessel, rather than to the libation itself. GINI 'the regular monthly or daily temple sacrifice,' syn. of sattukku, q.v. = Hebr. "?.", whose modern successor is the Mass. Gina, which is also an adjective 'firm, fixed, regular,' is, like igippu, a secondary forma- tion in Assyrian from Sum. gi-na, which was itself originally sug-</page><page sequence="5">58 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE gested by the well-known Semitic stem klnu ' to be firm.' On gi-na, see Prince, 148. ZIB&amp; 'sacrifice'= Hebr. M-7, but only etymologically, as zibii does not necessarily specify a slain offering. It can mean, however, a sacrifi- cial victim, but not exclusively, as it indicates any kind of offering at all; cf. ZA. V. 59, 7: zibe mimma gumru 'offerings of any kind at all.' The noun zibti is usually construed with naddnu 'give, present a sacrifice.' In IV. 20, nr. 1, obv. 26, zibi= Sum. A-KU-DU-UL, probably pro- nounced ak-kudul, where SA = ak, ag is clearly the sign of abstraction, while kudul may perhaps mean kud 'cut, tear,' ul = UL 'beef,' as UL is really the specified bull-sign with the corner-wedge. If this interpreta- tion is correct, it would indicate that the primitive meaning of the verb zabfs was 'slaughter,' just as in Hebrew. ZURQ"NU 'libation-vessel' and 'libation' (see Muss-Arnolt, 297). The stem zardqu 'sprinkle, pour,' I am inclined to identify with sardqu for which see also SURQINU. XUBURU 'a vessel of some sort,' syn. of birsidu, q.v. KALI 'magician, priest, class of priest.' The Sum. equivalent is US-KU 'a noble or high (ku) man' (ut). See s.v. the synonyms lagaru and surra. Kala was probably not a sacrificial priest, as the word is made equivalent to ?abri ' seer,' q.v. Br. 6199: lu-lig (AMEL-KAL) = kala and 6205 = abri2. KARA'BU 'favor, bless,' from which kirbannu, kurbannu, kitrtbu. Not to be confounded with qardbu 'approach.' KIRBANNU 'grain-offering' = SITA = lag. The same ideogram means also gangi ' priest' with Sumerian value sangu. The sign SITA indicated primarily 'irrigation, watering'; hence = 'libation' and here, in a special- ized sense, 'grain-offering' (see Muss-Arnolt, 435; Prince, 216). KURBANNU 'tribute,' but also 'offering,' as in V. 31, 6ab: kurbannu eqli 'offering of a field' = Sum. lag-gan, Br. 5985. See s.v. KIRBANNU. KITROBU 'gift, sacrifice,' from kardbu. Associated with nidabf, nindaba in ZA. v. 59, R. 11. For the ideogram see s.v. niq^ below. LAGARU, synonym of kala, q.v. The Sumerian word is lagar, being the equivalent of the sign (Br. 9572) which originally indicated the pudendum femince = the organ of plenty, the symbol of fruitfulness. Hence the idea of a temple-priest dealing with plenteous sacrifices and dispensing the plenteous gifts of the gods. See Prince, 217, and cf. s.v. kal^, surr4u. NAMXARU 'sacrificial receptacle,' from maxidru 'receive.' Syn. of birsidu, q.v. NIDBU ' freewill offering,' occasionally used as a synonym of sattukku, q.v. Cf. Hebr. , M1, and see nidaba. NIDABI or NINDABi ' the regular offering due a divinity, especially a goddess' (Muss-Arnolt, 649). The ideogram is RAM-PAT(SUK)-AN- NINNA, Br. 4773, probably to be read in Sumerian aka-guku dimmer</page><page sequence="6">PRINCE: ASSYRO-BABYLONIAN WORDS 59 Ninna 'the food of the goddess Ninna'= Iftar. The RAM-sign is clearly the Eme-Sal abstract prefix, as in Br. 9932, we find simply PAT- AN-NINNA = ukcu dimmer Ninna ' food of Ninna,' without any abstract sign. Hommel, Sum. Lesestiicke, 59, regards Sem. nidabu, nindaba as a Sumerian loanword from ni-dab, nin-dab, connecting it with Nisaba, but the stem =1; ' be willing' is well established in Semitic (cf. Brown- Gesenius, 621). NIqu 'libation' primarily, but also ' sacrificial lamb'; cf. Muss-Arnolt, 717. The common ideogram is the sign found in Br. 9088, whose Sumerian value is sigisle. Cf. especially Br. 9092: sigige = niqfi, passim. The sign was primitively an enclosure containing grain, so it must have meant primarily 'grain-offering.' In Br. 9091, it also signifies kitribu, a general word for sacrifice, q.v. The Sumerian word sigifle seems to mean ' crush (si, sig) grain' (= gif-?e; giS being the determinative for plants and ge = ' grain '). The verb is naqi ' pour out a libation,' used especially with kardnu ' wine' or with me ' water.' But naqfl is also used for sacri- ficing in general. See also s.v. SANGU. NISAKKU' sort of priest,' suggests the Semitic stem nasaklu 'perform'; viz., nisakku = ' a functionary.' The Sumerian equivalent is NU- (e?) AB = nu-eI' man of the house'; i.e., ' man of the temple'; hence ' priest.' Note Sum. ni-sag = niqg ' sacrifice' and also = nisakku, Br. 6703. This Sum. ni-sag seems to be a punning formation (' ni-sag the chief one') on Sem. nasaku and in this case nisakku is a secondary loanword in Semitic from ni-sag. See s.v. IsIPeu and GINJ. SURR'Y 'magician, priest'; synonym of kala, Jensen, ZA. vii. 174. See Prince, s.v. surru. SURMAXXU 'high-priest' from surrii and max 'high,' Cf. s.v. ganga- maxxu. SARA'QU 'pour out, libate' = Aram. PIP. The ideogram is DUB = dub, Br. 3929, from the idea of 'plenty,' attributed to DUB from its primitive sense ' surround, heap up' (see Prince, 87). SIRQU 'drink-offering, libation,' from sardqu. SARRAQU 'one who libates,' ZA. iv. 11. SURQiNU 'libation-vessel, libation,' probably the correct reading for zurqinu, q.v. SATTUKKU, originally 'the established standard of value' and then commonly ' the regular offering'= Hebr. '"V. and Assyrian ginaI, q.v. (see Muss-Arnolt, 786). The question as to the origin of this word is a doubtful one. I believe that it is from Sum. sa-dug = DI-KA = simply 'speak (KA) the decree' (DI); i.e., 'fix the standard.' Note that sa = DI = milku 'counsel,' Br. 9531, while dug = KA is a usual word in Sumerian for ' speak.' In Br. 9542: sa-dug-ga = DI-KA-ga = Sem. kagddu 'conquer'; i.e., 'pronounce the decree of victory.' It is highly improbable that Sum. sa-dug is a derivative from Arabic (thus Hommel; cf. Muss-Arnolt, 787). In V. 45, col. vi. 37, the form occurs in the Se-</page><page sequence="7">60 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE mitic verb-form tusattak, which may be only a denominative from the loan- word sattukku. Note also the form sataku used in Semitic for ' tribute,' I. 69, 35c. A Sumerian origin for sattukku seems more probable than a Semitic one. According to Halivy, ZA. iii. 346, santakku = ka'manu 'everlasting, enduring' is a synonym of sattukku, which is very probable. SOTUM small vessel, Hebr. 'IN 'a grain-measure.' From the Hebrew came the Greek rarov -- 1' modius.' The ideogram was DUK-BAR = Sum. banda. This banda is the original of the Semitized form band^ 'vessel,' Br. 4126. In Sum. bandi? also means 'pot de chambre' = 'urine- vessel,' Br. 1725, the usual word for which is kisi. See Prince, 52. PUXAD', fem. puxattu, see s.v. ASLU. PASIL(L)U 'sacrificial animal.' See s.v. BAZILLUM. PIRQETI, probably a wrong reading for tamqe'ti, q.v. ,CENu 'fill, heap up,' used especially with qulrinnu 'incense-offering,' q.v. See also s.v. etnu. QI&amp;TTu 'gift, present,' used frequently of offerings to temples. The Sumerian equivalents were SA-BA = ak-ba and RAM-BA = aka-ba; viz., ba = qi u ' give, present,' preceded respectively by the Eme-ku and Eme-sal abstract prefixes. QUTRINNU 'incense, smoke-offering.' This is the same sort of forma- tion as that seen in surqtnu = surqinnu. The ideogram was NA-NE = na-bil 'thing of fire,' wrongly read tarrinnu in Br. 1608. RAMKU ' libating priest,' from ramaku 'pour.' Syn. of nisakku. Note the Sum.sux-bu(gid) 'one who prolongs (bu-gid) the foundation'; i.e., ' one who makes a building endure, by pouring out the sacred libation' (?). See Prince, s.v. sux. In V. 23, 49; ramku also = ME = itippu ' sacrificial priest.' SABRU ' seer, interpreter'; also one who inspects the liver of an animal for purposes of divination. Cf. above, BARU. See Prince, s.v. gabra. ?abrai must be a shaphel formation from bar^I 'see, divine' (see Muss- Arnolt, 1006). SANGU ' priest, sacrificial priest'; very common. Very probably pri- marily from Sum. sag-saAig 'head'; i.e., ' head-man.' Note the Sumerian form sangu ' priest,' and also sangu name of sign for ' head '; (Cun. Texts, XI., 2, 41 a). While this is probably the derivation of the word, the Semitic priests may have seen in the form gangi2 a play on 9a naqi ' he who sacrifices,' from naqa ; really, ' he who pours out a libation,' which was considered to be one of the chief functions of the priesthood. This, however, does not impair the possible derivation of gangui from Sum. sag-sahg. Haupt, BA. i. 160, rem. 2, connected gangfi with .aga 'rave, rant, as one in an ecstasy.' This is also a possible association, although perhaps not the origin of the word. Note Pinches's form gagl 'priest,' JRA S., 1899, 105. In short, in the word ganga, we no doubt have another instance of varied association based on sound similarity, which is so commonly met</page><page sequence="8">PRINCE: ASSYRO-BABYLONIAN WORDS 61 with in the later Semitized Sumerian system; viz., ganga and Sum. sangu are derived from Sum. sag-sang ' head,' but were associated arbitrarily with Sem. 9a naqi and gaga. Note that the ideogram SITA = sangu plainly means the libator (see Prince, s.v. sangu). SURQINU; see s.v. SURQ-NU. TAKLIMU or TAQLIMU seems to be the synonym of nindabu, q.v., as it is represented by the same ideogram. TAMQ'TI, sometimes wrongly written pirqfti, from naqS. See Muss- Arnolt, 1171.
