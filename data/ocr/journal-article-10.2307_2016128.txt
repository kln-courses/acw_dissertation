Dr. Edwards' book recognizes the relation between philosophy and religion as necessary and not accidental. Christianity is not a philosophy, it is first and last a religion, but a religion forever in quest of an adequate philosophy. In the course of its history, it has made use of at least five great philosophies. In their order, Platonism, Aristotelianism, Cartesianism, and Berkeleianism have served this purpose and, according to Professor Edwards, "We hope that we may be able to find such a philosophy in a form of 4personal idealism' " which shall furnish to-day a satisfactory in- terpretation of our total experience including our intellectual de- mands and our Christian convictions. Despite the cross-currents in both contemporary philosophy and religion, the philosophical basis of religion and the theological aspects of philosophy make it clear that Christianity ca,n avoid philosophy only at "the peril of drift- ing into backwaters of obscurantism and subjectivity, . ." (p. 6. Cf. pp. 206-207). He confines philosophy to metaphysics or "the study of ultimate reality" and the method employed is "constructive criticism" while "organic coherence within the totality of experience is really our ultimate criterion of truth" (p. 36). Since philosophy must include a synoptic interpretation of experience, it must include re- ligious experience which is "the apprehension of the Supreme Real- ity under the form of worth or value" (p. 40). Like Dr. Griffiths. Dr. Edwards argues the "uniqueness" of religious values in criti- cism of Kant, Fichte, and Hegel. They are further agreed in criti- cism of Otto that "the Holy" is not merely one a priori, co-equal and co-existing with others like those of science, morality, and esthetics, but "the common plasm from which all the other values are differentiated, the matrix from which they are derived, their common fons et origo" (p. 55). Naturalism as a philosophical theory is not demanded by science and, if triumphant, it would destroy the spiritual life and cancel the objectivity of value. On the contrary, the structure of the uni- verse yielded by recent physics points toward freedom, teleology, and the objectivity of value. Personal idealism finds a place for the Christian conception of both God and man, and furthermore, a</page><page sequence="2">JOURNALS AND NEW BOOKS 587 place for them as set forth in the experience, personality, teaching, and work of Jesus Christ together with that of his followers. The philosophical interpretation of the problem of the relation of the divine and human in Christ is "that affirmations about Christ are affirmations about God, the Ultimate Reality" (p. 333). This, in fact, justifies the view that the Christian Trinity is an attempt in modern theology to understand God "as supremely manifested to men in the historical person Jesus Christ" (p. 358). Thus, "the higher anthropomorphism" ends with "the highest anthropomor- phism, Christomorphism" expressed in terms of "a personal ideal- ism" which we believe is acceptable to the best thought of our day in this field.
