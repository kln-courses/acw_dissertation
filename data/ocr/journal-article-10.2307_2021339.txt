Early in his life he discovered the appeal of esthetic and philosophic pursuits. He turned from the training in accountancy upon which he had entered and "oriented his life toward the meta- physical pursuit of the Beautiful and the Good. " By indefatigable study he gained an extensive familiarity with the scientific and ar- tistic culture of his age. At that time he chose to express his crea- tive vision in sculpture. He attempted, with some success, as his productions in Marseilles and in the Salon des Artistes Francais in Paris attest, to translate into this medium the inspiration he derived from Wagner's "Ring" as well as from the Christian tradition. Though his sculpture was well received, Warrain himself was dis-</page><page sequence="2">614 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY satisfied; he was not able to express himself adequately in this medium. At this time he came to the Polish platonist, mathematician, and metaphysician, Hoene Wronski. Through Wronski 's work (especi- ally his Law of Creation) Warrain was led to believe that he could find in metaphysics the key to an understanding of the lack of rhythm in modern art. "Une chose m 'avait frappe:" Warrain wrote in L'Armature Metaphysique (1925), " 'e'tait la merveilleuse rythmique des oeuvres de 1'Antiquite et du Moyen age et 1'absence presque totale de rythme dans les oeuvres modernes les plus remar- quables a d'autres egards." Warrain's first metaphysical essays were published in 1905 and collected a year later into a volume called La Synthese Concrete. This material he worked and reworked until it was given a form which satisfied him in L'Armature Me6taphys- ique. Meantime Warrain was also carrying on studies in mathematics. iHe published a series of papers on non-Euclidean geometries and on the geometries of "n-dimensions" which were collected (1907) into a book called L'Espace. Other mathematical studies of his later years were chiefly concerned with the metaphysical interpreta- tion of mathematics: Quantite, Infini, Continu (1928); La Matiere, 1'Anergie (1930); Essai sur les Principes des Algorithmes primitifs (1934); Examen philosophique du Transfini (1935); and Espaces et Geometries (1937). These metamathematical studies fascinated him; he believed that he had found in them the most satisfactory analogies and the symbolism most appropriate to the expression of metaphysical ideas. He became interested in the work of Charles Henry on psychophysies and was also led to the study of the concept of cosmic harmony in Kepler. The results of these pursuits sup- plied Warrain with the materials for four further monographs: La Conception psychologique de la Gamme (1921); La pensee de Charles Henry (1930); L'Oeuvre psychobiophysique de Charles Henry (1932) ; and Essai sur Il'Harmonies Mundi de Kepler (1942), in two volumes. Warrain's primary concern during the last years of his life was the attempt to make the ideas of Wronski more readily available and accessible. He intended to publish L'Oeuvre philosophique de Hoene Wronski in seven volumes. Volume I, published in 1933, presented the bases of the theory which Wronski called "Messian- ism. " Volume II, which Warrain published in 1936 under the title "Architectonique de l'univers" is a presentation of Wronski's sys- tem of cosmology. Volume III, 1938, contains Warrain 's com- mentary on themes suggested by Wronski; this has the title " Ency- clopedie developpee d'apres la Loi de Creations." World War II</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 615 and the death of Warrain prevented the completion of this project, which was to include Wronski's writings on mathematics, celestial mechanics, physics, politics, philosophy of history, the creation of man and religion. Warrain 's chief systematic work, L 'Armature Metaphysique, from which we have quoted earlier, was based upon Wronski's law of creation. In it he argued that the principles of identity, contra- diction, and sufficient reason if considered in isolation from each other lead to the divergent positions of realism, idealism, and prag- matism. If, however, they are properly considered in necessary and reciprocal interrelation, they produce reality and thought. The law of creation is constituted by the transcendental develop- ments of thought, to which we are led by analysis of the mutual relations of the three fundamental principles. This analysis also accounts for the transcendental developments of reality, which are comprehended by Warrain in the term "metaphysical armature." The "armature" is the architectonic of the fundamental metaphys- ical conceptions. Three distinct systems are incorporated into the armature: the system of the transcendentals, or reality; the system of the categories, or thought; and the system of the representative intuitions, in which reality and thought are brought together. The four antinomies of Kant are the most obvious of a number of antin- omies, all of which are present in the system of representative in- tuitions. The resolution of the antinomies is progressively achieved by means of a transcendent synthesis, a union of reason and life, which is the essence of man. Since every element in the system of representative intuitions involves an antinomy resolvable only in terms of the anthropomorphic higher synthesis, Warrain's concep- tion of the universe was anthropomorphic. From this description, cursory though it be, it is clear that what Warrain calls "metaphys- ics " might better be labeled "gnosis." It is not surprising to learn, then, that another of Warrain's in- terests lay in the study of earlier gnostic systems. His primary intention, in reading and writing on these gnosticisms, was to demon- strate that their elements and principles were translatable into the idiom of the Wronskian system which he had adopted. Nor is it remarkable that the gnosticism to which he paid most attention was the Kabbala, that medieval Jewish gnosis in which number mysti- cism and alphabetic permutations played a large part. Unfortu- nately Warrain knew no Hebrew; the sources upon which he relied were the Kabbala Denudata of Knorr von Rosenroth, into which theosophical elements of non-Kabbalistic origin enter, and the inex- act and, in some ways, distorted French translation by Jean de Pauly of the Zohar. In the volume here under review, La Theo-</page><page sequence="4">616 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY dicee de la Kabbale, there are two essays on Kabbalistic themes: the first of these, "Les Sephiroth," was written in 1911 and pub- lished in 1931; it is here reprinted with a second, "Les Noms Divins," left in manuscript by the author at his death. A third essay, on a cognate theme, "La Nature eternelle d 'apres Jacob Boehme," originally published in 1930, is appended. Warrain believed that "the ancient writers expressed themselves in concrete terms: their knowledge was more intuitive than ours and they tended immediately toward synthesis, the natural goal of thought" (p. 13). Belatedly they discovered that such a synthesis led to a confusion which could be resolved only by careful analysis. Thus did philosophy begin and with it the systematic use of abstract ideas. "The progress of thought consists in the gradual establish- ment of the agreement of the profound intuition of the Ancients with the precise analysis of the Moderns" (p. 13). The problem of progressive thought is, then, to discover the abstract and con- ceptual equivalents to the concrete terms and images in which the doctrines of the ancients were expressed. The enterprise is com- parable with the translation of the experiences of everyday life into scientific concepts. Thus " 'Boiling water' signifies, for the igno- rant, a certain sensible phenomenon: composed of steam, bubbles in water, heat, a characteristic sound, etc. For the savant, boiling is a transformation of energy defined by certain abstract relations: temperature, pressure, etc." (p. 13). For a real sense of what boiling is, both the concrete experience and the abstract concept are necessary. "A scientist who knew boiling only as a theory of energy without ever having seen water boiling would be more igno- rant than ourselves" (p. 14). This analogy and a series of similar ones constitute Warrain's Apologia for the type of study which he has undertaken. This work can not be regarded, then, either on grounds of the reliability of its sources or on the basis of the intentions of its author, as an attempt to discuss the doctrines of the Kabbala in their own terms, historically. It must be considered, rather, in its own terms, as a contribution to the sort of intellectual synthesis that Warrain was trying to create. Thus, as we have pointed out earlier, War- rain was interested in discovering a principle of rhythm which he found lacking in modern art; Kabbalistic doctrine includes a theory of polarity which it expresses concretely in terms of bisexuality in the universe and theologically in terms of the "masculine" divine attribute of justice and the "feminine" divine attribute of mercy. This doctrine of bisexuality is translated by Warrain into "the sys- tem of balance," that is, it is converted into a part of his theory of rhythm. So, too, in the anthropomorphism of the Kabbalistic doe-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK NOTES 617 trine of the Sephiroth Warrain finds a "concrete" basis for his " abstract " metaphysical anthropomorphism. His treatment of Boehme is similar. In summary, La The'odicee de la Kabbale is of little value to the reader who wants information about the Kabbala; it is, however, a very interesting revelation of the thought of a contemporary gnostic who has attempted to build a systematic "metaphysical" philosophy on somewhat strained interpretations of a modern mathematical and physical foundation.
