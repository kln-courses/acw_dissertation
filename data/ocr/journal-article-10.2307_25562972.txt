Kathlyn O'Brien Untitled Photo: Muins Moynahan Kathlyn O'Brien_ PROJECT ARTS CENTRE February 1996 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^'-^^^" ' ^'^^ r^i'- '5^ After graduating from the NCAD in the mid-1980s, Kathlyn O'Brien spent four years living and working in Poland. Thereafter she spent a while in London before returning to settle in Ireland. These sparse details are gleaned from a brief press release accompa nying her exhibition. Since this release is virtually the only docu mentation involved, her reticence about her work, in and age of in creasing verbosity and exegesis, is noteworthy. She evidently prefers to let her striking, spooky sculptures stand alone. When you see them, however, one biographical detail positively leaps out at you: four years in Poland. Either those years have left an indelible stamp on her soul, or she was drawn to Eastern Europe be cause something in the cultural atmosphere there chimed with a pre-existing facet of her inner life. Her sculptural assemblages tap directly into the dark undercurrent that characterises a particular strand of the Eastern European imagi nation. Their pungent, gallows humour recalls the bleak levity of Roman Polanski, the grotesquerie in the fiction of Jerzy Kosinski or Hungarian Agota Kristof. What these individuals share, in biograph ical experience and/or fictional terrain, is a preoccupation with an early life subverted by cruel, exceptional experiences, premature en counters with a world in which the moral fabric is torn to shreds - just the kind of world, in fact, that would account for the state of 'Innocence Lost in Transit', the title that O'Brien has chosen for her exhibition. O'Brien's sculptures are assemblages, ingeniously fashioned from the detritus of a lost era. Their scattered components are shot through with a palpable nostalgia, redolent of the richly textured imaginative world of childhood. They also exploit the innocence of their sources, for they recall a time before franchises, merchandising and movie tie-ins, when things were hand-crafted, when there was an honesty about the use of materials and the conception of their use. Each component is well-worn and retains in its new guise the res onance of its own history. Each fragmentary composition, mean while, mirrors the undermining of erstwhile certainties, of personal, sexual and national identity, of bodily integrity. The body in general does not fare well. In fact it's possible to read some sculptures as anthropomorphic portraits, each one a person beset by all manner of harsh, even lethal strictures, or, given the way machine and body parts are consistently shown as interchangeable, a Frankenstein creature built and repaired with whatever was to hand - witness the various means of locomotion, the castors and wheels, an ancient roller skate and home-made prosthetics. The wider world evoked is compounded of a related range of ref erences, to the dark woods and long nights of fairy tales, and also to small theatres, to fairgrounds, freakshows and circuses. All of these entertainments possess a dark undercurrent to begin with, an edge of cruelty and exploitation, which O'Brien unfailingly chooses to heighten. Many pieces could be musty cabinets of curiosities, stocked with the macabre objects that people choose to collect. Others might be toys, albeit toys reinterpreted, so that subtexts of insecurity, violence and fear are brought to the fore. Don't doubt, though, that those subtexts are there to begin with: just think of the slightly eerie quality of an old hand-carved doll. We might think of them, then, as toy theatres of cruelty in which, for example, three dolls -Three Graces? - immobilised because they have no legs (the fate of many a doll) are ranged behind a very threatening curtain made from cutlery. In another work, sharks prowl inside a baby's pram, which might also be a coffin, otherwise empty save for some faded family snapshots. The weakest piece in the exhibition was the largest: an ambitious installation in the back space of the Project. The darkened room was rent by thunderbolts, embodied in fierce, jagged eruptions. Certainly 5 2 CIRCA</page><page sequence="2">there was no denying the overwhelming sense of menace. But it was also a very literal, instantaneous work that sacrificed everything to initial impact, rendering baldly explicit what was for the most part deviously implicit elsewhere. Largely because there was the occa sional tendency to over-ice the cake, eyes through the mincer or on a grater - recognisable variations on an image with a venerable surre alist pedigree - some pieces came close to reaching for an easy, 'spe cial effects' shudder. When she was more restrained it was clear that O'Brien had no need of Grand Guignol effects. The best pieces worked quietly, de pending on the complex interplay of elements, subtle hints that all is not as it seems, the gradual realisation of the implications. Lest it all sound too bleak for words, too given to nihilistic humour, there was also, it is essential to note, an evident love for the objects that were variously coopted, a sensitivity to their qualities even if, in the end, they serve to flesh out a dark, pessimistic vision.
