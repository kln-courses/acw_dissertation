<plain_text><page sequence="1">MINOR NOTICES The Life of the Ancient East: being some Chapters of the Romance of Modern Excavation. By Rev. James Baikie, F. R. A. S. (New York, Macmillan Company, 1923, pp-xiv, 463, $4.00.) The title of this 'book is misleading, because it suggests an account of the manners and customs of the peoples of antiquity, whereas it presents mainly the more</page><page sequence="2">Minor Notices 587 spectacular results of exploration and the more striking deeds of certain eminent rulers of the past. To write the life of ancient peoples would require long and detailed study in a different direction, including all ac- cessible material, much of which actually comes from the common people and is now buried in technical journals published in many languages. Such material is already a considerable mass and constantly growing. Such books as this, however, serve a use ful purpose in popularizing the results of scholarship and in laying them before large numbers of people. After an introductory chapter on the work and its methods, five chapters are devoted to Egypt, two to Babylonia, one each to Assyria, Troy, Greece, Crete, and Palestine. Except in one case, all the chapters are named after some ancient city, as, Abydos, the Holy City of Egypt, and the Dawn of History; Nineveh and its Robber Kings. These titles have the snap of captions of newspaper articles, but serve to at- tract attention and fix a definite idea in the mind of the reader. Of course, they are one-sided, and others equally descriptive might be chosen. Nineveh was more than the home of robber kings, and was not the only ancient city worthy of that name. It would be equally true and more distinctive to call it " city of art and literature ". That Tutankhamen was thought worthy of having a chapter bear his name was perhaps in- evitable, in view of recent events in Egypt. Only one chapter is devoted to Palestine, and this is concerned with one site, Gezer. It is a pity that some distinctivelylsraelite ruin could not have been found. This lack is now made good by the publication of the Harvard Excavations at Samaria, just issued by the Harvard Uni? versity Press (1924). The brief bibliography in most cases gives only surnames of authors and titles of books, without full names, date, or place of publication. This is regrettable, since the bibliography is meant as an aid to " further study of subjects dealt with ". Some readers will wish, in case of quotations, which are not rare, that the author had seen fit, occasionally at least, to give volume, page, and name of book cited. The author appears to have a good acquaintance with his subject, and the impression made by the book is that he reports his authorities correctly. The difficulty of testing this point, owing to lack of references, has just been indicated. It is a pity to repeat a misleading statement (p. 249, top) about the arrangement of the writing on the Hammurabi Code. The correct state? ment is: The writing is in short perpendicular lines, reading from above downward, and arranged in horizontal columns. The first line in each column is on the right; the second, on the left, etc. The work is illustrated by thirty-two well-selected, full-page photo- graphic reproductions of ancient scenes, and is provided with a sketch map and an index. David G. Lyon.</page><page sequence="3">588 Reviews of Books Social Life in Ancient Egypt. By W. M. Flinders Petrie, D.C.L., F.R.S., F.B.A. (Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Com? pany, 1923, pp. ix, 210, $2.00.) In six chapters Professor Petrie discusses the Framework of Society, the Administration, Rights and Wrongs, Private Life, Supplies and Commerce, Constructions and De- fence. This book, like the author's Arts and Crafts in Ancient Egypt, will doubtless be widely read, for no other confined to just its subject has yet appeared. But qn all the themes of the several chapters more reliable information is available?in such works as Professor Breasted's History of Egypt and especially the new edition of Professor Adolf Erman's Aegypten und Aegyptisches Leben im Altertum, reworked by Professor Hermann Ranke, which appeared in 1923. The trouble with the Petrie method is that established facts and the author's theories are inextricably interwoven, and readers not trained in Egyptology are liable to be misled. The English style leaves much to be desired, even such clauses occurring as this: "although every one is free to change their occupation as they prefer " (p. 11). But especially we object to the spirit that in the table of " approximate dates " labels the author's own dates " by the Egyptians " and the alternative dates " by Berlin " ! The last designation is not even strictly accurate, as the dates given coin- cide with Mr. Breasted's rather than quite with those of the Berlin his? torian, Eduard Meyer. The book is the forerunner of a larger work, Descriptive Sociology of Egypt, which Professor Petrie is preparing under the terms of the will of the late Herbert Spencer, and this fuller work will give the references lacking in the small book under review. La Civilisation Egeenne. Par G. Glotz, Membre de l'lnstitut, Pro- fesseur d'Histoire Grecque a l'Universite de Paris. {UEvolution de VHumanite, dirigee par Henri Berr, IX.] (Paris, La Renaissance du Livre, 1923, pp. viii, 471, 15 fr.) This book belongs to that very in? teresting series on the evolution of humanity, of which some eight volumes have already appeared and of which I have already reviewed Jarde's La Formation du Peuple Grec {American Historical Review, XXIX. 112.) The book contains a general introduction on such subjects as the sea, soil, climate, productions, the excavations, chronology, the Aegean peoples, the neolithic and chalcolithic periods, the age of bronze and the first Cretan hegemony the second Cretan hegemony, the Mycenaean hegemony, and the Dorian invasion. Then follows a readable and ac? curate account of the material, social, religious, artistic, and intellectual life, with eighty-seven figures, three maps, and four plates, and a good bibliography and index. The excavations in Crete, where as long ago as 1878 a modern Greek by the significant name of Minos Kalokairinos established the site of King Minos's Cnossus, and on the mainland of Greece at Tiryns, My- cenae, Dimini, Korakou, Zygouries, etc, have now yielded so much ma? terial for the Minoan civilization that we can draw some very important</page><page sequence="4">Minor Notices 589 historical conclusions. It is remarkable in reading Professor Glotz's book to see how much we really now know about physical types, costumes, armor, architecture, even about the family and about the government, about agriculture, industry, commerce, and international relations in the early civilization in the Aegean, although we are not yet able to read any of the inscribed documents of that time. We now have a fairly com- plete picture also of the aniconic as well as the anthropomorphic Aegean divinities, the Minoan places of worship, their ceremonies, their cult of the dead, their religious games, especially the bull-fight. We have many examples of their painting, though not a bit remains of Polygnotus or Apelles. We have their beautiful jewelry, gems, and hundreds of vases, as well as their still undeciphered language. For this period archaeology is the only history, and Professor Glotz's book compares favorably with the similar book in English by Hall on Aegean Archaeology, which covers the same field of history. A peculiar mistake occurs on page 15 where Schliemann is credited with the belief that the sixth stratum at Troy was the city of Priam, whereas Schliemann firmly believed that Homer represented such early history that the second city must be the Homeric city. It was Dorpfeld who proved that there were five cities before Homer's. On page 377 we miss a reference to Caskey's publication of the Gothic-like chrysele- phantine statuette of a Cretan snake goddess in Boston {American Journal of Archaeology, XIX. 237 ff.). To the bibliography should be added Poulsen, Der Orient und die Fruhgriechische Kunst, and Stais, Collec- tion Mycenienne. English readers will quickly correct " Bryn-Maur " and the wrong initials of Mr. Wace. David M. Robinson. Greek Life and Thought: a Portrayal of Greek Civilization. By La Rue Van Hook, Ph.D., Professor of Greek and Latin in Barnard Col? lege, Columbia University. (New York, Columbia University Press, J923, pp. xiv, 329, $3.50.) Attempts to sum up the meaning of Hel- lenic civilization for the benefit of our superficial generation grow apace. Beginning some forty years ago in Germany with two well-known series of Handbiicher, the movement has passed to the interpretative stage in France, England, and this country. R. W. Livingstone's Pageant of Greece, W. C. Greene's The Achievement of the Greeks, and Professor Van Hook's work are the latest?the last two the ablest?of these inter- pretations. Although Van Hook's treatise presents nothing that scholars did not know before, it is a notably thorough and solid compendium of facts be- longing to many branches of classical philology and archaeology. The ambitious scope, as well as the conciseness of treatment, is shown by the fact that in three hundred pages he has included chapters on Athens and its monuments, the Greek house with its furniture and utensils,</page><page sequence="5">59? Reviews of Books sculpture, athletic sports and national festivals, political, social, and economic conditions, writing and books, Greek literature, education, the theatre, philosophy, religion, and science. The author very properly concentrates his attention upon Athens, in which converged and from which radiated most of the achievements of the Greek genius which still exert an influence on Western civilization. Well-selected translations from Greek authors of many periods enrich the exposition. In a work so comprehensive it is inevitable that statements should occur which the specialist may query or which, he may think, require qualification. The universal negative in the proposition that " no ac- curate census was ever taken of all the elements forming the population " is an example. Accurate is a term which we should apply with diffi- dence to a United States census, and it should be explained that " all the elements" include women and children, whose numbers we can deter- mine only roughly by the law of averages. Our records are, as every one knows, fragmentary, but there was a fairly thorough enumeration in 445 and in 309 B. C, the latter, certainly, including a count of aliens and possibly of slaves. I think, too, that Professor Van Hook has ex- aggerated somewhat Plato's disparagement of democracy. These, however, are minor points. The total achievement is a hand- book of great utility, and will make an excellent complement to Pro? fessor Greene's work. The latter emphasizes the interpretation of the facts, with less attention to imparting information about them, and in- dulges in fuller comment on their significance; Professor Van Hook's work abounds in facts, neatly and attractively set forth, without elo- quence, but with an obvious sympathy, too reticently expressed. The illustrations, in general, are chosen wisely, but it is a pity that a better map of Greece could not have been provided. It does not in? clude the islands or lonia, and is, therefore, useless for locating the places mentioned in the account of the literature, philosophy, and sculp? ture. There is a good index, and an excellent bibliography makes foot- notes unnecessary. C. B. Gulick. Roman Politics. By Frank Frost Abbott, Kennedy Professor of Latin Language and Literature at Princeton University. [Our Debt to Greece and Rome, no. 30.] (Boston, Marshall Jones Company, 1923, pp. vi, 177, $1.50.) The series of which the book under review is one is a praiseworthy undertaking and the individual volumes should not be subjected by the scientifically inclined reviewer to a microscopic anal- ysis. The volumes are not long and the matter is purposely written to be interesting. So much the more credit, therefore, to the writers and to Hadzsits and Robinson, the editors, for bringing out a classical series of short and interesting books which are very creditable pieces of work as well.</page><page sequence="6">Minor Notices 591 Frank Frost Abbott has already made notable contributions to the study of Roman politics. His previous work falls easily into two classes: the formal scientific, and the sympathetic and interestingly humane. This little volume bears the mark of a personal struggle to be both at once. There are four chapters in the book of quite unequal length. The last, Some Final Reflections, which in five pages sums up the political indebtedness of our modern politics to Rome, gives a list which seems to demand more pages of proof than this little book has. It is no light matter to give the Romans credit for " the representative principle, the jury method of trial, civil law, a clear conception of the rights of a citizen, a jealous regard for law and tradition, a comprehensive system of political checks and balances, model systems of local government and civil service, and methods of governing, civilizing, and unifying alien peoples which have never been equalled". Yet Professor Abbott suc- ceeds in making out a very clear case for all these claims. The problems common to the Romans and to modern peoples, such as labor problems, elections, the recall, pensions and bonuses, which fill the third chapter, are interesting and give much food for quiet thought. It is, however, in the second chapter, Roman Politics and Modern Politics, where the author discusses and compares the individual and the state, constitutions, the legislative and executive branches of government, the judiciary, taxation and finance, and especially the conception of citizen- ship, that Professor Abbott strikes his real stride. The book is sound, and deserves its growing popularity. R. V. D. Magoffin. The Danegeld in France. By Einar Joranson, Ph.D., Instructor in History in the University of Chicago. [Augustana Library Publica? tions, no. 10.] (Rock Island, 111., Augustana Book Concern, 1923, pp. 248, $1.50.) This is by far the most extensive work which has yet been devoted to the Continental complement (and perhaps antecedent) of the tributary payments which were exacted from the English by the Danes in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Under the somewhat questionable title of Danegeld in France, the author has made a detailed investiga- tion of all the recorded tributes (twelve or thirteen in number, and ex- tending over the period from 845 to 926) which were taken by the Norse invaders from the West Frankish Kingdom. Each payment is " studied in detail with a view to determining (1) the reasons for it, (2) the methods by which it was raised, and (3) the effect it may have pro? duced ". The work is " intended to be exhaustive ", so far as payments on a national scale are concerned. A more summary chapter deals with certain local payments of tribute; and there are brief appendixes on Danegeld in Frisia, in Brittany, and in Lorraine and the East Frankish Kingdom There is a full bibliography but, unfortunately, no index.</page><page sequence="7">592 Reviezvs of Books The chief difficulty encountered in a study of this sort is, of course, the paucity of materials; and in this respect Dr. Joranson's plight is far worse than that of students of Danegeld in England. For the West Frankish Danegeld never developed into a regular annual tax, as did the English; and it has left no records which are to be compared in im- portance with the Inquisitio Geldi, Domesday Book, and the early Pipe Rolls. Consequently there are many questions concerning it which really are not susceptible of definite answers. In such cases the tempta- tion to resort to hypothesis and even to conjecture is natural and under- standable, but it is a temptation which ought to be restrained more rigor- ously than Dr. Joranson has done. The book is valuable, but it would have been distinctly better had it been more concise, less occupied with theory, and more closely confined to demonstrable fact. C. W. David. Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, fourth series, volume VI. (London, the Society, 1923, pp. 211.) Of six articles in this vol? ume, the first is one on the Relations of Great Britain with Guiana, by the Reverend G. C. Edmundson. Readers of British writings on this subject will not be surprised to perceive from Mr. Edmundson's narra? tive that all the acts of aggression were on the part of Venezuela. No aggressions by Great Britain; the meek inherit the earth not by any ac- tivity on their part, but by Scriptural promise; yet, to put the matter briefly, it is observable that the orncial Colonial Office List of 1885 gave the area of British Guiana as 76,000 square miles, that of 1886 as 109,000 square miles, while in the edition of 1922 it stands at 89,480. Mr. Edmundson says: " On this [appeal from Venezuela] the American President, Grover Cleveland, without approaching the British Foreign Office, and with no knowledge of the rights of the case or of the grounds on which the British government had taken decisive action, issued a de- cree, December, 1896, appointing a Commission to investigate the merits of the boundary dispute ", and so on. One who can write thus may well be asked to read the twenty-five historical and argumentative pages of Mr. Olney's instruction of July 20, 1895, a copy of which Mr. Bayard left with Lord Salisbury on August 7. Next, on the basis of Lord Egmont's diary, Mr. R. A. Roberts writes interestingly of the Birth of an American State (Georgia). Mr. Charles Johnson of the Public Rec? ord Office describes the System of Account in the Wardrobe of Edward I. The wardrobe at that time including nearly all the spending depart- ments, its system is of much importance to the student of administration. Dr. Emilio Re of the Archivio di Stato in Rome presents some docu? ments found in his archives relating to the English Hospice in Rome in 1365. Sir Charles Firth gives in a most entertaining manner a large amount of information on the Portraits of Historians in the National Portrait Gallery. The volume concludes with the Alexander Prize Es- say, by Mr. E. W. Hensman, on the East Midlands in the Second Civil War, May to July, 1648.</page><page sequence="8">Minor Notices 593 Honors and Knights' Fccs. An Attcmpt to idcntify the component Parts of certain Honors and to trace the Dcscent of the Tenants of the same who held by Knight's Service or Serjeanty from the Eleventh to the Fourteenth Century. By William Farrer, Litt.D. Volume I. Bidun, Chokes, Visdelou, Wahull, Curcy, Peverel of Nottyngham. (London, Spottiswoode, Ballantyne, and Company, Limited, 1923, pp. ix, 296.) Future historians of honors in their more general political and economic aspects, scholars interested in genealogy, and those editing manuscripts and seeking to identify the names of many good knights who have long since worn ((their brave state out of memory " will be grateful to Dr. Farrer for these arduous studies in the descents of lands, of which this volume is the first fruit. His purpose, as he states it none too fully or clearly in the preface, is to trace the descent of tenements comprised in honors and knights' fees that remained more or less intact for a con- siderable period of time downward from Domesday Book, to trace also the descent of the multitudinous subtenants of these fees, and also up- ward and downward from the earliest extant evidence the tenants of all tenements of which an honor formed at a later date than Domesday Book was composed. His authorities are the printed sources in which information as to the descent of fees would be naturally sought for, and such of the manuscript sources of the same character as he has had time and opportunity to use. Of the six honors treated in this first vol? ume, Peverel, Chokes, and Wahull are given as examples of the type of honor that remained for some time without disintegration, Bidun and Curcy as examples of accumulated tenements erected into honors at a later date. The method adopted is to give first an introductory state? ment of the general descent, in which the reader may wish there had been contained some of the more general conclusions Dr. Farrer must have drawn from the great amount of evidence he has collected, and thereafter sections dealing with the descent of the individual fees, each section ending with references to the sources from which the informa? tion has been compiled. An index of persons and places gives the key to the use of the book, although one may perhaps regret the omission of some of the less important place-names within the vill. A subject index, while entailing much additional labor, would have added to the value of the work. The mass of detail is so great that it is difficult to find the valuable information the book contains on various feudal matters, re- liefs, serjeanties, terrae Normannorum, and the like. The fairly con- stant relation suggested between pre-Conquest owners and Norman ten? ants would be of interest, if proven. N. Neilson. The Story of the English Towns: Halifax. By J. S. Fletcher. (London, Sheldon Press, 1923, pp. viii, 116, 4 s.) This little volume of barely over one hundred pages does not pretend to be more than a popu- lar account of the famous Yorkshire borough. Halifax still lacks an</page><page sequence="9">594 Reviews of Books adequate history of its later development since the standard work by John Watson was published in 1775 and a later edition, begun by F. A. Leyland in 1869, has never been brought up to date. Mr. Fletcher is an enthusiastic antiquarian, who is already known to students of English municipal history through previous volumes in this series. He writes interestingly of the Yorkshire towns, and the present volume is readable and highly informative. It consists of twelve brief chapters of topical character, which deal with political, social, and re? ligious aspects of Halifax history from early times to the middle of the last century. Especial attention is given to notable personages con- nected with the borough in medieval and modern times, but little effort is made to deal in any detail with borough government. The chapters on the Poll Tax of 1379, the Parish Church, and Parish Records have more instrinsic historical value than any others in the book. A list of eighteen books and articles on Halifax history is given under the heading of " Authorities" and there are eight worth-while illustrations. The index is sufficient for the size of the volume. N. M. Trenholme. Abstract of the Bailiffs' Accounts of Monastic and other Estates in the County of Warwick under the Supervision of the Court of Augmen- tation for the year ending at Michaelmas, 1547. Translated from the original roll by W. B. Bickley; with an Introduction by William Fowler Carter, F.S.A. [Publications of the Dugdale Society, vol. II.] (Lon? don and New York, Oxford University Press, Humphrey Milford, 1923, pp. xxi, 180, $11.70.) Among the schedules in the submission of the accounts of the "particular receivers" of crown lands (whose jurisdic- tion approximated a county) before the Court of Augmentations were included abstracts of the bailift's' accounts of their revenues which had been collected from them by the particular receivers, and accounted for locally in the county town before the auditor of the court for the county. Such an abstract for Warwickshire for the year ending Michaelmas, 1547, owes its present publication by the Dugdale Society to its escape from its place in the Augmentations Office of the Exchequer, and its eventual deposit in the Reference Library in Birmingham. The chief interest of the Dugdale Society is the local history of War? wickshire, and the two indexes exclusively devoted to place-names and names of persons show that this volume is primarily intended for anti- quarians, genealogists, and local historians. The accounts give the names of tenants, and the rents they paid for their farrns, together with an enormous amount of detail about rectories impropriate, rents of free tenants, rents reserved to the crown, perquisites of courts including heriots and reliefs, fees of ofticials and servants, tithes, church repairs, mills, highways, bridges, the grantees, great and small, of the royal estates, the extent of the monastic lands still in the possession of the crown on Henry VIII.'s death, and the extent of the non-monastic</page><page sequence="10">Minor Notices 595 estates in Warwickshire. There is some material here for the more general economic and social history of sixteenth-century England, but the value of the book for this purpose is lessened by the fact that it is merely an isolated document. Its high cost?$11.70, American price, for 202 pages?may prevent any companion volumes. Frederick C. Dietz. Correspondance de Bonaventura Vulcanius pendant sgn Sejour a Cologne, Geneve, et Bale, (1573-157/), precedee de quelques Lettres ecrites avant cette P.poque. Publiee et annotee par H. de Vries de Heekelingen, Docteur es Lettres. (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1923, pp. xv, 562, 12* gulden.) The world of scholarship, too, has something of the infinitely small and infinitely great which the rhetoric of science celebrates. Here are five hundred pages of Latin letters covering a small portion of the life of a sixteenth-century Netherlands classicist to whom Sandys's three-volume history of scholarship devotes three lines. His name was DeSmet, but he thought Vulcanius sounded better. The letters are edited from archives by Dr. de Heekelingen for the light they throw on the history of the years 1573-1577 and as a parergon of his partly published studies on Geneva as the nursery of Dutch Calvinism. The letters are quite readable for anyone who is in the mood to read humanistic Latin. They give an interesting picture of the relations be? tween the classical scholars of the day. Among Vulcanius's correspond- ents are Theodore de Beze, Thomas Eraste, Henri Estienne, Adrien Van der Myle, Christophe Plantin, and some sixty others. Too much space is given to the affair of the writer's dismissal from the chair of Greek at Cologne because of the enmities aroused by a street brawl, and too much for all but specialists to the Greek and Latin texts which he or his friends are editing or hoping to edit. Especially interesting are the references to the Stephanus Plato. There is much also about printers and the art of printing. The publishers, he often laments, have been made timid by war and the hard times. Political or military news is often added at the close of the letter. He follows the progress of the King of Poland, the future Henri III., of John of Austria, who has made a five years' truce with the Turks and is coming to Belgium with thirty thousand men, and of the return of the Spanish troops from the Netherlands. He has stories of the purchase of a fine mummy from an Italian, who took it from a Turkish ship at the battle of Lepanto, and of a charlatan who promised to turn the whole of Lake Geneva into vinegar. Most interesting are the letters on the siege of Antwerp and the " Antwerp Fury ". The first letter would supply a text for a disquisition on easy-going modern education. It is a little essay on liberal culture and the choice of a profession, written at the age of eighteen to a fellow student. The young Vulcanius in fluent Latinity and with a somewhat conscious dis- play of Greek proverbs and familiar quotations weighs the claims of</page><page sequence="11">596 Reviews of Books philosophy, polite letters, and the three professions on a youth at the cross-ways of life. It is a school-boy performance. But what school- boy of to-day could even approximate to it ? The editing or the proof-reading has been a little hasty. There are too many misprints and some false readings which a professional eye would have detected. On page 70 usura must be iactura. And on page 211 for Sardo interim canet Circe read surdo etc. The Greek quotations, as too often in books of to-day, are deplorable. Some of them are hope- lessly " pied ". The editor should have taken counsel with a classicist. There is a Greek colloquialism known to Aristophanes?ov&amp;? ypv, not a bit, not a syllable. Vulcanius writes on the twenty-fifth of December, 1576, " ex Antwerpia ne Gry'quidem [adfertur] "?not even a syllable of news from Antwerp. The editor comments on this capitalized Gry: " Cette designation revient a plusieurs reprises. II a ete impossible de l'identifier." Any classical colleague would have told him. Paul Shorey. The History of the Mansion House. By Sydney Perks, F.S.A., F.S.I., F.R.I.B.A., City Surveyor to the Corporation of the City of London. (Cambridge, University Press, 1922, pp. xv, 228, 67 plans, 35 s.) Mr. Perks has added greatly to our knowledge of medieval and early modern London. He has had access to all the unpublished material in Guildhall and at the Mansion House, with the result that we are pre- sented with a noteworthy compilation of sources relating to the site of the Mansion House and to its construction. Over one hundred plans, plates, and illustrations add to the value of the text and provide an in? teresting pictorial record. The first eight of the thirteen chapters of this work are strongly historical and archaeological in that they deal with the history of that region of London in which the Mansion House was later situated. The stream or natural sewer of the Walbrook, which ran into the Thames near the site of the Mansion House, is discussed and described at length, also the Stocks Market, St. Mary Woolchurch, St. Stephen (Walbrook), the statue of Charles II., and the Great Fire of 1666 and its effects. This last is dealt with in a special appendix. The last five chapters con- tain a most detailed and minute record of the purchase of the site of the Mansion House, the plans for the building, its erection, and later addi- tions and improvements. While valuable for its original material, this volume is written in an unattractive style and the author has not digested his facts. His knowl? edge of London place-names leaves something to be desired, and a list of his authorities would have been welcome. The index is barely adequate and omits a number of important names of persons and places mentioned in the text. N. M. Trenholme.</page><page sequence="12">Minor Notices 597 The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes, from the Beginning of the Long Parliament to the Opening of the Trial of the Earl of Strafford. Edited by Wallace Notestein, Professor of English History in Cornell Uni? versity. (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1923, pp. xix, 598, $7.00.) The works of Sir Simonds D'Ewes have long been an invaluable mine for scholars. His authoritative Journal of all the Parliaments of Queen Elizabeth was published in 1682, thirty-two years after his death, his less important Autobiography appeared in print in 1845; but his most significant contribution, his Journal of the first five years of the Long Parliament, though utilized by notable historians of the period, from Carlyle to Gardiner, has hitherto remained in manuscript. While the latter incomparable critic appraised it as " inestimable ", its bulk and the condition of the text were well calculated to give pause to any but a valiant scholar. Professor Notestein estimates that to print the whole would require eight substantial volumes in quarto; moreover, D'Ewes during the course of the proceedings and debates hastily jotted down rough notes, but much was happening, he was called away for frequent committee meetings, and he left many gaps. His aim was to make a fair copy of his notes at night and to insert in appropriate places speeches which were printed in separates, but the evenings were all too short and the hard- pressed diarist was often all too weary to carry out his laudable in- tentions. Moreover, some of the separates, if they were ever inserted, have gone astray. It has been the task of Professor Notestein to arrange this combina- tion of more or less incomplete narrative and rough scribblings, to ex- plain allusions which may be obscure, and to add extracts from other contemporary accounts?four of them never previously used?for the purpose of supplementing or clarifying the version of D'Ewes. This meticulous seventeenth-century antiquary has given us a wonderfully complete and lifelike reproduction of what happened in the House of Commons while one of the most momentous of revolutions in history was being shaped. He puts before us the conflicts, the hesitancies, and enables us to see into the minds of the participants. Furthermore, much new light is thrown upon parliamentary procedure, upon disputed elec- tions, upon the lives of the clergy, the workings of the courts, and various other matters of import. It is to be hoped that the competent editor will be able to carry on the Journal, which in the present volume goes only from November 3, 1640, to March 20, 1641. Arthur Lyon Cross. The Revolutionary Idea in France, 1780-1871. By Godfrey Elton, Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. (New York, Lbngmans, Green, and Company; London, Edward Arnold and Company, 1923, pp. vii, 191, $3.50.) This bold and brilliant essay is based on two general concep- tions, an interpretation of the Revolution of 1789 as essentially a strug-</page><page sequence="13">598 Reviews of Books gle for equality and order and a sharp contrast between it, so conceived, and the economic revolutions of 1848 and 1871. The first of these theses is at least open to question. The author maintains that the first revolution had been " an instinctive national movement, which existed long before 1789, to establish order, primarily in the interests of the mi^ddle classes, and equality, primarily in the in? terests of the peasant"; that the period from October, 1789, to August, 1792, had no significance for the essential movement; that the Terror was important because of its effective abolition of feudalism and its return to a strong central government and a vigorous foreign policy; that Na- poleon, by developing and completing these two achievements, " was the Revolution " (p. 70) ; and that 1830 was a sort of postscript in which feudalism was finally routed and " the revolutionary settlement" (equal? ity and order), henceforth a conservative force, becomes " unquestion- ably the basis of modern France ". There is much that is incontestable in this view of what the Revolu? tion actually accomplished. It is by no means so certain that it is what it set out to accomplish. Mr. Elton explicitly denies Aulard's insistence on the Declaration of Rights as the essential programme of the Revolu? tion, he scornfully waves aside the " ideologues" of the Constituent Assembly, and, taking his stand on the popular notion that the French- man is indifferent to liberty, he quietly eliminates the first word of the republican motto. But surely the ideologues, with the whole eighteenth century behind them, had as much authentic tradition behind their gener- ous programme as lay behind the more limited aspirations for adminis- trative efficiency and equal landownership. One may feel, with Aulard, that the Declaration is the complete statement of aims only a part of which were actually realized. There were important sections of French opinion at the time of Napoleon which certainly did not regard him as the full expression of the Revolution. One feels a sort of Hegelian artificiality in the author's philosophy of history; he seems to force his facts to fit into his formulas. Reading backward from what transpired, he compresses the spirit of the great Revolution into its genuine but somewhat cramped achievement, as though it had never dreamed larger dreams. The contrast he draws between the first and " the second Revolu? tion " (as he calls 1848 and 1871), with emphasis on the socialistic ele? ments of the latter, is sound. But why seek the spirit of the first revolu? tion in the part of it which endured and that of the second in the part which perished? And, for Aulard at least, the second is the natural de? velopment of the first, rather than its antagonist. In any case, the book is immensely stimulating and well worth read? ing. EUGENE N. CURTIS. Le Comte Mole, 1781-1855: sa Vie, ses Memoires. Par le Marquis de Noailles. Tome deuxieme. (Paris, fidouard Champion, 1923, pp.</page><page sequence="14">Minor Notices 599 491, 20 fr.) The second volume of the memoirs of Comte Mole bears out the promise of the first and whets the appetite for more. It is al? ready evident that this work will occupy, when finished, a high place in that branch of historical literature which the French have cultivated with such signal success. Written with great distinction and scrupulous care, it will not only reward the historical investigator with many a new fact and with many a keen observation but will beguile away his time most pleasantly, so full of interest is every page, so masterly the exposi- tion. We are in the company of a man of wide and varied cultivation, of large knowledge of the world, of close and intimate contacts with the personages and circumstances of his time, of mellow and reflective mind. With an altogether exceptional personal equipment, intellectual, moral, and social, M. Miole was eminently fitted not only for useful and intelli- gent action in the field of high politics but also for narrating what he had seen and done himself, and what he had seen others do. This particular volume covers a period of two years and throws much light upon the political history of France from the fall of 1815 to the fall of 1817. The ministry of the Due de Richelieu is its outstand- ing theme, and that ministry lives again with extraordinary vividness in these very vital pages. One of the features of the book is the remark? able series of descriptions of the men, big and little, who played their parts upon the public stage. M. Mole is a penetrating, practical psy- chologist, and one would be compelled to search far and wide for a gal- lery of historical portraits that could be compared with his in subtle ob? servation, in just and measured delineation, in sharp and piquant char- acterization. Drawn with a master hand, and with singular coolness and detachment, are these sketches of Louis XVIII., the Due de Richelieu, Decazes, the Duke of Wellington, Pozzo di Borgo, Pasquier, Laine, Tal- leyrand, Royer-Collard, Madame de Stael, and many others. Events, too, as well as persons, receive appropriate and illuminating treatment. And what is of course the main purpose of the book, the presentation of the activities of Count Mole himself during these years, is accomplished with discretion and without exaggeration and increases our admiration of the individual and the statesman. The competence and the tact of the editor of this valuable volume are attested on every page. Charles Downer Hazen. Diplomatic Portraits: Europe and the Monroe Doctrine One Hun- dred Years Ago. By W. P. Cresson. (Boston and New York, Hough- ton Mifflin Company, 1923, pp. xix, 371, $4.00.) Dr. Cresson's book is not a piece of intensive scholarship. It does not pretend to be. It is a series of sketches of the more salient diplomatic personalities of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The figures treated are the Tsar Alexander, Napoleon, Castlereagh, Talleyrand, Madame de Krudener, AM. HIST. REV., VOL. XXIX.?39.</page><page sequence="15">600 Reviews of Books Gentz, Metternich, Chateaubriand, John Quincy Adams, and James Monroe. The sketches are written in a pleasant, even an attractive, style; whatever else may be said of them they certainly are not dull. As is to be expected, there is a certain unevenness of tone. The least success- ful tend to degenerate into a rehearsal of events already familiar to the student of the period; the best, those on Alexander and Gentz, for ex? ample, convey a strong sense of the personality of their subjects. Throughout the work Dr. Cresson has turned again and again to the comparison between the events of the Napoleonic period and its after- math, and the events of the Great War and of the peace negotiations that came in its train. He has done this in a stimulating way, and has at least suggested an approach to the study of the first quarter of the nine- teenth century which is capable of a treatment at once more scientific and more profound. In a sense the subtitle of the book, Europe and the Monroe Doctrine One Hundred Years Ago, is a misnomer. Only the last of the essays can be said to deal with the Doctrine in the strictest sense. But this essay is one of the best. It performs two distinct services to the litera? ture of the subject. In the first place, it brings out, what has never been adequately treated, the development of the Anglo-American entente in the months previous to the famous interviews of Canning with Rush. Those interviews have too often been considered as the beginning of a story which ought to be carried back to the earlier conversations of Adams and Stratford Canning, and to the whole trend of British policy in the spring and early summer of 1823. In the second place, Dr. Cres? son gives to President Monroe the honorable place in the evolution of the Doctrine to which, in the opinion of the reviewer, he has a right. For the kind of thing it assumes to be, the book is distinctly good. Catholicism and the Second French Republic, 1848-1852. By Ross William Collins, Ph.D. [Columbia University Studies in History, Eco? nomics, and Public Law, vol. CXIL, no. 1.] (New York, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1923, pp. 360, $4.00.) This monograph rests chiefly upon careful use of the French printed sources. Almost every- thing in print of any considerable importance which came from French Catholic circles during the period of the Second Republic has been laid under contribution. Non-Catholic sources, while not neglected, have not been so fully utilized. The manuscript materials, of which only a small amount has been employed, come chiefly from the Normanby papers at the British Foreign Office. Dr. Collins has done his work thoroughly, dispassionately, and with a clear conception of the points which deserve attention. His investiga- tion has not brought to light anything striking which was not already known. It has, nevertheless, enabled him to set forth in a clear, orderly, and interesting way the reasons why the Catholic Church welcomed the</page><page sequence="16">Minor Notices 601 coming of the Second Republic and why it afterwards east its powerful influence in the scales against the Republic. Dislike of the July Mon- archy rallied the Catholics to the Second Republic in its early days. Fear of the Socialists, gratitude for the support given to Pius IX. against the Roman republic, and a strong desire for the freedom to establish and control Catholic schools which was secured in the Falloux Law were the leading reasons why they afterwards aided Louis Na- poleon in destroying the regime they had helped to create. Catholic in? fluence, though important, was not in either instance the decisive fac? tor, nor were the Catholics all of one mind. The literary style, while decidedly above the usual level of doctor's dissertations, exhibits the common trait of too much quotation. The author's views, which might well have been given considerable promi- nence, are almost smothered by his excerpts from the sources. In the chapter on the Roman expedition a good deal has been included which has very little bearing upon the subject of the monograph. Frank Maloy Anderson. Pierre Curie. By Marie Curie. Translated by Charlotte and Vernon Kellogg, with an Introduction by Mrs. William Brown Meloney and Autobiographical Notes by Marie Curie. (New York, Macmillan Com? pany, 1923, pp. 242, $2.25.) This is a delightful book. It marks one of the few instances in which the proverbially humdrum life of the student of physical science, together with its austere ideals, has been made in- telligible, and Madame Curie's sketch is all the more fascinating as the result is reached unconsciously. Years ago, on receiving from the Curies their handsome magnetic researches, printed with the customary elegance in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique (1895) and in the bulletin of the Societe d'Encouragement pour l'lndustrie Nationale (1898), it seemed obvious that experiments of such precision must have been made in correspondingly opulent surroundings. To my amazement I now learn that only by the thrifty husbandry of moments of scrap leis- ure could the research be completed; that it was done on sufferance, as it were, in a laboratory improvised in hallways and out-of-the-way places, with the authors largely their own mechanicians. The same sureness of vision, the same tireless intellectual adventure gave radium to the world. Of course, old Scheele in the discovery of chlorine had little more than discarded medicine bottles at his disposal; but that was all very long ago. When we learn that what, in view of the new revela- tions which it has originated, will rank with the most important dis- coveries (1902) of the twentieth century, when one reads that radium was isolated in dish-pans and other kitchen utensils, in a leaky shack in the back yard throughout years of needless labor, one involuntarily pauses to grasp the situation. Surely among the well-informed col- leagues of the Curies there should have been some influential person</page><page sequence="17">602 Reviews of Books whom such an anachronism would have appalled. It was not so. The sequel was to be more like the tale of Cinderella in a scientific setting; for when the turbid waters cleared and crystallized, the old shed shone with a light that none had seen before. It must have been a period of exaltation with the Curies, such as comes to few. However, in the midst of it, the life of Pierre Curie, hurrying as he probably was with his mind intent on the problems of the day, was suddenly snuffed out by a passing automobile. It was an irreparable loss to France. She hardly guessed the scope of it. With Curie, the genius of a new epoch took her flight elsewhere; for the profound phi? losophy, which has revolutionized physical science and to which the be? havior of radium is like the key unlocking the evidence, was left to the inspiration of Englishmen, Germans, Danes, and Dutchmen. True, there has been an endeavor to make amends. A handsome pension has re- cently been settled on Madame Curie. We note, however, that contemp- orary scientific honors are not unliable to be stimulated by political op- portunism. It seems to have required the ardent enthusiasm, which welcomed Madame Curie's American visit, to kindle a belated noblesse oblige in France. The reader will be grateful to the translators for their graceful text, and the introduction adds relevant information to give the book com- pleteness. Carl Barus. Labour in the Coal-Mining Industry (1914-1021). By G. D. H. Cole. [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Economic and Social History of the World War, James T. Shotwell, General Editor.] (Oxford, Clarendon Press; London and New York, Oxford University Press, Humphrey Milford, 1923, pp. xiv, 274, $2.50.) " No one can say that the story which I have to tell ", writes Mr. Cole, " is pleasant or en- couraging. It begins with the remarkable achievements of [the first years of] the war. . . . Follow the period of State control, the struggles . . . of the later war period. Next comes the season of high hopes, of plans for the re-organization of the industry, of expectations of good things to follow the coming of the peace. But soon the ugly ulterior consequences of war reveal themselves, and the story ends on a note of disillusionment, if not of positive despair. . . . It leaves both the min- ing industry and the workers employed in it?or unemployed?in a con- dition far worse . . . than for generations past." For the war-time the book merely supplies a running commentary from the labor viewpoint to Sir Richard Redmayne's official-minded com- panion volume. For the " season of high hopes " and the Sankey Com? mission it adds nothing to the work of the late Arthur Gleason. Its real value lies in the clear-eyed picture of what followed. The hopes them? selves rested partly on the first effect of the peace, an immensely profit- able demand for British coal abroad; this soon gave way to the collapse</page><page sequence="18">Minor Notices 603 of Continental markets and therefore of British industry. Mr. Cole's chronicle confines itself strictly to particular things done and undone? the government's sudden abandonment of control of the industry just as its fortunes changed; the dissensions and defeats of labor; the rejection of the " profits pool " that might have lessened the miners' suflerings by recapturing for wages part of the winnings of the fortunate mines in an industry in which profits varied widely both with good luck and good management. But it carries throughout a sense of the inevitable dis- aster befalling a nation whose life depended so largely on economic ar- rangements that had been shattered by the war and the peace. It is a chronicle written by a social theorist and therefore a chronicle with implications. Carter Goodrich. African Questions at the Paris Peace Conference; with Papers on Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Colonial Settlement. By George Louis Beer, Chief of the Colonial Division of the American Delegation to Negotiate Peace. Edited with Introduction, Annexes, and Additional Notes by Louis Herbert Gray, Secretary to the Colonial Division. (New York, Macmillan Company, 1923, pp. xliv, 628, $6.00.) Because of the more or less unsuccessful results of the participation of the United States in the Paris Peace Conference there has been a tendency among writers to underestimate the value of the services of the experts at- tached to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. This scholarly volume, prepared for the press after Mr. Beer's death by his associate, Mr. Gray, is a convincing corrective. As the reviewer is one of those who erred in this way, he does not hesitate to say that part VI. of Mr. Beer's book, dealing with the recommendations for the settlement of the colonial questions, is a welcome revelation to him. Although he had the privilege of discussing at length all these moot questions with Mr. Beer during the Peace Conference, he had not before realized how great an effect Mr. Beer's admirably documented reports had upon the Ameri? can Commission and upon the Peace Conference as a whole in influenc- ing the African decisions as embodied in the Treaty of Versailles and the protocol of St. Germain. The scope of this book is limited to the former German colonies, Middle Africa, and Egypt But in the course of his discussion of prob? lems that arise in specific regions, and under particular conditions, Mr. Beer has gathered together testimony and opinion and has expressed judgments which throw light on questions affecting every part of Africa. This fact, combined with the erudition, accuracy, and insight of the author, makes his book the best guide that the reviewer has ever read for the student of the history of Africa during the last half-century. To the historian, Mr. Beer's book affords access to information concerning problems and events of recent African history, digested and impartially</page><page sequence="19">604 Reviews of Books stated, that could not have been accessible before except by wide and laborious reading. On his shelves the reviewer has most of the books to which Mr. Beer refers, but, although he has himself written a book on the European colonization of Africa, he confesses frankly to not hav? ing read to as good advantage as Mr. Beer had done. He wishes that he had had access to the papers in this volume before he wrote. And he feels sure that several other writers on Africa in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would make this same statement had they the oppor? tunity to review Mr. Beer's volume. There are only two suggestions that we have to make to the editor when he prepares the next edition, that he enlarge and classify his bibliography and that he make his very thorough index general, abandon- ing the idea of indexing by parts. Herbert Adams Gibbons. My Rhineland Journal. By Henry T. Allen, Major-General, U. S. A. (Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1923, pp. xvi, 593, $6.00.) This volume presents parts of the journal of the chief commander of the American forces of occupation on the Rhine, from June 27, 1919, to February 19, 1923. It is the author's thought " that they may be useful in forming a better estimate of the men and measures beyond our con- fines" and "may reveal the practicability and advantages of a frank policy based on fair play and a square deal". It is likely that the vol? ume will serve his ends. It certainly records a multitude of interesting facts concerning the American occupation and the consequent dealings with many representatives of other nations. It is likely, however, to be a matter of surprise to many readers that the author, however able and successful, should think it important to record, at such length and in so minute detail, his social successes, luncheons and dinners and hunts which he attended, and the flattering things said to him by persons of high position. A very great reduction of this part of the book would have caused it to contribute much more effectively to the knowledge of what is really important in the transactions in which the author was engaged, for that contribution, if one can disentangle it from the en- cumbering social record, is large. The Regime of the International Rivers: Danube and Rhine. By J. P. Chamberlain, Ph.D. [Columbia University Studies in History, Eco? nomics, and Public Law, vol. CV., no. 1.] (New York, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1923, pp. 317, $3.50.) The international control of rivers, which has long been practised, has, of late years, with the strengthening sentiment toward internationalism, become a subject of special interest. There are those who have used the joint administration of the Danube, probably the most advanced international achievement known to history, as a text from which to preach wider international organization. In the</page><page sequence="20">Minor Notices 605 book before us, there is very little indeed of this tendency. The author recognizes that an institution of this kind is worth studying as a likely avenue of progress toward the international society, need for which has long existed. And this is quite natural as his material was in part col- lected for the use of the Inquiry created by President Wilson for the study of questions affecting the peace. Mr. Chamberlain has approached his work from the standpoint of a lawyer. Taking up the Danube and Rhine river controls consecutively, he gives a careful and informing account of the geography of the river basins and of the historical stages of the joint control, closing each with a chapter on the effect of the World War and the treaty of peace. There is a valuable appendix giving a summary of important river treaties in? cluding, besides the Rhine and Danube, the Elbe, Pruth, Po, Scheldt, Congo, and Memel rivers. There is a brief bibliography. Thorough, informing, accurate, clear in exposition, the work of Mr. Chamberlain is a worthy achievement and is easily the best summary of the history and treaties affecting the joint control of the Rhine and Danube. It would have added to the value of the study to give a sum? mary of the principles which have been applied in joint administration of rivers and of their historical development. The principle that the control is restricted to riparian states, and that they shall be equally represented, and the later principle, that non-riparian states may partici- pate in the control, are indeed mentioned in the course of the pages. A special discussion of these principles, and of such other matters as river tolls, police, ownership of vessels, maintenance of wharves, dredging, and lighting would have made the meat of the subject nlore accessible and serviceable, and would have made this excellent work much more interesting. Edward Krehbiel. Modern Chinese History; Selected Readings. A Collection of Ex? tracts from various Sources chosen to Illustrate some of the Chief Phases of China's International Relations during the past Hundred Years. By Harley Farnsworth McNair, Ph.D., Professor of History and Govern? ment in St. John's University, Shanghai, China. (Shanghai, Commercial Press Limited, 1923, pp. xxxvii, 910.) The purpose of this volume is indicated by the title. The preface tells us that it grew out of Professor McNair's work in St. John's University. The selections were made for the guidance of his students and during the course of three years' in- struction. The author says: " In the process of learning history the student should, from the outset, be led to realize that it is a subject not to be read from the point of view of one person only. The danger of the text-book habit is that the student?and, it is to be feared, sometimes the instructor?falls into the error of thinking that he knows ' ancient', or ' medieval', or ' modern' history when he has covered a year's work with a text bearing these words on the title page."</page><page sequence="21">606 Reviews of Books The extracts are from public documents and historical works, some of which are not accessible to the ordinary reader, and are of value as enabling the student to compare and weigh conflicting or varying ac? counts of an incident or opinions upon questions of importance. He be- gins with a translation of the mandate of the Emperor Ch'ienlung ad? dressed to King George III. The condescending attitude of the emperor and his assumption that King George was eager to acquire the civiliza- tion of China make this most interesting reading. The whole period of modern Western intercourse with China is very well covered. The most recent documents consulted are those connected with the Washington Conference. Brief comment connects the selections and gives them proper setting. At the end of each chapter a list of supplementary readings is given, covering the period concerned. The selections and the supplementary readings are all in English. For the American or European student this may be considered a defect, but it is to be remembered that the book was primarily intended for Chinese students, who have as a rule an acquaintance with two languages only, Chinese and English. Since the eighteenth century, moreover, British relations have been dominant in the Far East and the most im? portant literature of this period is in the English language. The work will be found to be of considerable value by students and instructors in the United States and, indeed, by all who are interested in the international relations of China, which are year by year becoming increasingly important. E. T. Williams. Imperial Control of the Administration of Justice in the Thirteen American Colonies, 1684-1776. By George Adrian Washburne, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of European History, Ohio State University. [Columbia University Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law, vol. CV., no. 2.] (New York, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1923, pp. 191, $2.00.) The author's study of the attempts made by the British government to regulate and control the colonial judiciary naturally falls into two sections: one dealing with the establishment and regulation of the judicial machinery within the colonies, and the other covering the ap- pellate jurisdiction of the Privy Council. In connection with each of these phases of his subject, Dr. Washburne has arrived at two interesting conclusions: first, that the British government made a conscious effort toward a uniform system through regulation by commissions and in- structions to the governors and by other means; and second, that in its capacity as a final court of review the Privy Council was on the whole scrupulously impartial as between the various interests represented in cases before it. One feels, however, that Dr. Washburne has not exhausted the pos- sibilities of investigation in either field. It is certain that he has not</page><page sequence="22">Minor Notices 607 studied the entire body of commissions and instructions, in so far as they relate to the judicial machinery in the colonies, and more important still, has not attempted to discuss, with any fullness, the degree of success with which they were carried out. To cite a single example, one wishes that he had expanded his few paragraphs dealing with the controversies that arose over the right to create the courts and to appoint their officers, and had paid some attention to the important and illuminating dispute which arose in New Hampshire, a dispute here entirely overlooked. The author's study of the appeals to the Privy Council constitutes by far the larger portion of the work. But it conspicuously fails in pre? sent ing any clear picture of the way the system operated and of the respective functions of the Board of Trade and the Committee of the Privy Council; while in its arbitrary classification of the cases on appeal, its unnecessarily elaborate statement of the details of the cases, which only serve to confuse the reader, and its frequent and somewhat inex- plicable unwillingness to discuss or even to mention the final outcome of many important cases, it is less satisfactory than is Professor Schlesinger's article on " Colonial Appeals to the Privy Council" in the Political Science Quarterly for 1913, a study of the subject to which Dr. Wash- burne has added little of importance. As a contribution to our knowledge of the early American judicial system and of British colonial policy, this monograph is disappointing, but in its very inadequacy it is suggestive of opportunities for further investigation. Quaker Education in the Colony and State of New lersey: a Source Book. By Thomas Woody. (Published by the Author, University of Pennsylvania, 1923, pp. xii, 408, $4.50.) This is another study of Quaker education by Professor Woody, similar to his volume on Early Quaker Education in Pennsylvania (reviewed by the present writer in this Review, XXVI. 838-839). Such studies are much needed in order to correct a common fallacy, the notion that education in America, especially before 1840, was obtained principally through the agency of public schools. It is of course true that, outside of New England, church and private agencies were much more important and widespread than those of a public character. This book gives a history of the relation of one of the religious denominations of New Jersey to education. After a chapter on Quaker educational policy, the next four chapters give a detailed chronological account of the various schools in the four principal Quaker quarters or districts, viz., Shrewsbury, Burlington, Salem, and Haddon- field. Other chapters are on the education of the poor, " inferior races ", apprenticeship education, school control and organization, curriculum and text-books, and the transition to state schools. The educational view; of George Fox, William Penn, Anthony Benezet, John Woolm?.n, and other Quaker writers are briefly set forth,</page><page sequence="23">608 Reviews of Books those of the London yearly meeting, and those of Philadelphia and Bur- lington, both the Orthodox and Hicksite branches of the Society. The chapters giving the history of individual schools are very detailed, with numerous extracts from original sources. It is shown that the Quakers did not develop their schools till rather late in the colonial period, mostly after 1760, and that nothing approaching a system arose till after the Revolution. The Quakers were not very rigid about sending their children to their own schools; a considerable number attended those of a mixed character, or the district or common schools (cf. tables on pp. 125, 133, 194, 225, for dates 1840 to 1900). The attitude of the Friends as individuals, and that of the meetings, towards the problem of the education of the poor is of interest, because of its relation to the development of the notion of free public education for this class. Of interest also are the chapters on the use of the system of apprenticeship as an agency of education, and those showing the ef? forts of the Friends to educate the negroes, bond or free, and the Indians. In general it is shown that the ideal of the leaders for a " guarded religious education ", elementary in character and secured through prohibitions and limited association, was carried out, though the children of other de- nominations often attended Friends' schools. The idea of extended edu? cation was based on religious philanthropy, which finally yielded to the broader conception of public education. As in the case of his former work, the author is more interested in the facts than in the attempt to explain them. So, little attention is given to the setting?to the political, social, or economic factors that determined progress or lack of progress, or to the relation of his story to other educational movements. Within these limitations his work is excellent, and is one of the few books in this field that is not likely to be rewritten. M. W. Jernegan. Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789. Edited from the Original Records in the Library of Congress by Gaillard Hunt. Vol? umes XXIV., XXV., 1783, January i-August 29, September i-Decem- ber 31. (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1922, pp. vii, 1-528, 529-1050.) The publication of these Journals was begun in 1904, under the editorship of Dr. Worthington C. Ford, chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, continued (beginning with the volumes for 1780) under his successor, Dr. Gaillard Hunt, and by 1914 had reached the completion of the volumes for 1782. At that point the exigencies of the war brought a cessation of publication, which has per- sisted for practically a period of ten years; for, although these volumes bear the imprint date 1922, their actual issue did not take place until the beginning of the present year. Meanwhile Dr. Hunt withdrew from the Division of Manuscripts, having already, however, carried forward these two volumes to page proof. The final work of publication has, accord- ingly, been performed by Mr. John C. Fitzpatrick, assistant chief of the</page><page sequence="24">Minor Notices 609 Division of Manuscripts, and Miss Emily B. Mitchell, assistant in the division. Mr. Fitzpatrick has furnished a prefatory note, wherein is set forth briefly the more important aspects of the proceedings of Con? gress during the year. The year 1783 has special significance as the year of the peace. The preliminary articles of peace were signed in Paris November 30, 1782, and ratified by Congress April 15 following. The definitive treaty of peace was signed September 3 and, although it was received by Congress on December 13, the ratification by Congress was held up a full month (until January 14, 1784) for want of representation from nine states. Treaties with other powers also were made during the year, and the United States began to assume a definitive status among the nations of the world. It followed upon the establishment of peace that Congress must bring its activities, both civil and military, to a peace basis, and these problems oecupied much of its attention. As for the army, there was a past as well as a future to be settled, and the ominous threats from unpaid troops, and presently an actual mutiny of one body of them, threw upon Congress one of its most serious problems. The problem of finding revenues sufficient to meet the urgent requirements of Con? gress had already in the preceding year reached a stage that was es- sentially crucial, and during the year 1783 the most earnest efforts of that body were directed toward finding the solution. Two other matters that have important places in these proceedings are the cessions of western lands and the search for a permanent seat of the central govern? ment. As to the character of the Journals of this period, as shown by a comparison of this edition with the older printed Journals, it will suffice to refer to what was said in the pages of the Review (XX. 670) respect? ing the volumes for 1782. E. C. B. The Constitution of the United States: an Historical Survey of its Formation. By Robert Livingston Schuyler, Associate Professor of History in Columbia University. (New York, Macmillan Company, 1923, pp. viii, 211, $1.50.) In publishing the substance of his lectures, delivered during the summer of 1921 at Cambridge University and the London School of Economics and Political Science, Professor Schuyler has made available to the general reader a satisfying account of the for? mation of the Constitution of the United States. The book is satisfying because it is a well-balanced, well-written, and well-printed story of " a human achievement which has not grown less significant with the pass- ing of the years ". In the first chapter the author reviews American experiments, point- ing out the importance of federalism in world-politics, its development during the colonial period, and its embodiment in various plans for union prior to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation. Chapter II. is</page><page sequence="25">610 Reviews of Books devoted to the Confederation?especially its lack of unity and its politi? cal and economic weaknesses. The facts here presented are intended to explain the movement leading up to the Federal Convention of 1787 and the work of the Fathers in framing the Constitution. The spirit of the convention, the remedies proposed, the compromises of the Constitution, the agreement among the Fathers, and the revolutionary character of their work are clearly set forth in chapter III. In discussing the struggle for the adoption of the Constitution in chapter IV., attention is called to the fact that " the Federal and Anti- federal parties were composed of groups based principally upon economic interests". Ratification " marked the consummation of the revolution which the Federal Convention had begun". In all candor the author declares that " the establishment of the Constitution can be justified only by the right of a people to change their form of government without legal authority, the right which had been invoked in 1776, the right of revolution ". Here also the author reviews and disposes of such " fanci- ful" and " preposterous " explanations of the origin of the Constitution as (1) the view that it was modelled upon the English Constitution, (2) the claim that it was of Dutch origin, and (3) the theory that it was the product of an individual mind. The book concludes with a chapter on the launching of the Con? stitution in which the author disposes of the " myth" that it " was launched in a calm sea, unlashed by the winds of partisanship ". Among the factors subsequently making for the apotheosis of the Constitution, the author mentions(i) the wave of commercial prosperity upon which it was floated, (2) patriotism, (3) the " silences " of the Constitution, (4) the support given it by the clergy, the lawyers, and the school- teachers, and (5) the lack of knowledge of how it had been framed. Benj. F. Shambaugh. The History of Mother Seton's Daughters: the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Ohio, 1800-1023. By Sister Mary Agnes McCann, M.A., Ph.D. Volume III. (New York and London, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1923, pp. xv, 321, $4.00.) The present volume is the third of a work of four volumes which, when completed, will give a history of the Sisters of Charity founded by Mother Seton, from the early days at Emmitsburg, Maryland, to the present time. In an earlier volume Sister Mary Agnes gives the reasons why the community at Cincinnati may be looked upon since 1850 as the standard-bearer of Mother Seton's ideals; for in that year the foundation at Emmitsburg became affiliated with the Sisters of Charity of France. The entire work is entitled The History of Mother Seton's Daughters, but since 1850 it deals almost exclusively with the history of the com? munity at Cincinnati. The third volume covers the period of develop? ment of this very successful community from 1870 to 1897. During</page><page sequence="26">Minor Notices 611 these years Catholicity in the West and Middle West grew enormously. The parochial school idea had taken firm root and the demands for sisters to conduct the parish schools increased with each new settle? ment. The community at Cincinnati kept pace with the growth of Catholicity, and Sister Mary Agnes shows us an interesting picture of this extension. Some of the most interesting passages of the book are those which give an account of the little band of sisters who went into the Far West to begin work at Trinidad, Colorado, and Albuquerque. Albuquerque was a frontier village, and even " the most enthusiastic settler would never have pictured the splendid American city of Albuquerque, with its institutions, schools and University, of to-day". Among the names mentioned in the volume the best known is Sister Anthony. She had charge of the sisters who nursed the wounded at the front during the Civil War. St. Peter's Orphan Asylum, St. John's Hospital, and the Good Samaritan Hospital were under her direction for many years. She is still fondly recalled by the old residents of Cincin? nati. Sister Mary Agnes has written more in the form of memoirs than an impersonal historical account. She herself has had a large share in shaping the events which she describes, and while this fact is not set forth in the work still the personal touch of one who has lived the events is felt throughout the entire narrative. A striking feature of the book is the deep interest displayed, not merely in affairs of local concern to the community but in events of national importance and in the general affairs of the Church. The book offers a sturdy and touching defense of Bishop Purcell and the Very Reverend Edward Purcell in the un- fortunate financial difficulties to which they fell victims. Sister Mary Agnes with this volume, as with her previous ones, has made a contribution to the history not only of her community but of Cincinnati in general and of the Catholic events of the period. What- ever defect there is in the book comes from the fact that the author has been too much a part of the affairs she relates and is as a result not able to take the critical attitude which one at times desires. James Henry Hammond, 1807-1864. By Elizabeth Merritt, Ph.D. [Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science, series XLL, no. 4.] (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1923, pp. 151, $I-5?0 James Henry Hammond was a brilliant, if eccentric, member of that remarkable group of South Carolinians whose words and deeds ex- cited and sometimes angered the rest of the country during most of the half-century from 1810 to 1860, for when South Carolina was nationalist to the core the rest of the country was inclined to sectionalism and when South Carolina became sectional the rest of the country turned to na- tionalism. Hammond's career is that of an unselfish secessionist whose one great objective was successful secession. And it so happened that</page><page sequence="27">612 Reviews of Books when he urged secession his state held back; and when the state urged secession he held back. This perversity in men and events makes the study Miss Merritt has undertaken quite a problem and she has endeavored herself to be both historian and philosopher, I mean safely philosophical in her approach to her general theme. She sees South Carolina through friendly, if critical, eyes; she views Hammond in the same way; and her attitude toward the remainder of the country is that of one a little uncertain but on the whole well-informed. South Carolina sources, manuscript and printed, are most exhaustively used. The result is an excellent study, a sorrowful but useful narrative, that scholars may read with pleasure and rely upon as trustworthy. William E. Dodd. Richmond: its People and its Story. By Mary Newton Stanard. (Philadelphia and London, J. B. Lippincott Company, 1923, pp. xx, 239, $3.50.) Mrs. Stanard gives us a series of pictures of Richmond, Vir- ginia, chosen at such intervals as best bring out the story and showMt to be a City with a Soul. It was on Sunday, June 10, 1607, four weeks after the founding of Jamestown, that Captain Christopher Newport and the redoubtable John Smith were the first white men to look upon the present site of Rich? mond. Master Archer photographed the scene in these words: " Here the water falls Downe " (p. 4). The orator, poet, and seer are all of one brood. The intuition of Patrick Henry as to the issue of the conflict with the mother country found voice in old St. John's Church, in March, 1775, when, his ear at- tuned to the moving forces of the world, he announced that the next gale that blew from New England would tell of the clash of arms. Just out- side one window of the old church lies the grave of Colonel Carrington. He was one of the patriots that could not make his way into the tiny building; but standing at the window he listened to the heroic appeal of Henry, and turning away with the words still vibrating in his heart, he said, " When I die, bury me on this spot". On Twelfth Street in Richmond there has just been torn down an old hospital that bore a tablet setting forth that near this spot there met in 1788 the convention that ratified the Constitution of the United States. The atmosphere was aflame with ideas. All the big batteries were moved up to position. John Marshall was there, never dreaming that his structural decisions would later fix the centre of gravity of the American government and determine the issue at Appomattox. Henry with his fiery oratory and George Mason with his solid impact with- stood the phalanx that included Marshall, Madison, George Wythe, and the pervasive influence of Washington. The vote stood a majority of only eight for the Constitution.</page><page sequence="28">Minor Notices 613 Mrs. Stanard has touched with ardent sympathy the history of a city that has been mellowed by suffering and that has shared world impulses. Virginia has been vicarious. The mother colony, midway on the At- lantic, she has been committed by position as well as inherited political instinct to a mediatorial office in American history. Yorktown and Ap- pomattox are wounds that she bears upon her breast. This was not an accident. It is this spiritual significance of Richmond's experiences that Mrs. Stanard, whose family has been an integral part of them, has brought out. It is a city whose history, with her sons and daughters, mounts almost into the realm of a religious emotion. In view of the meeting of the American Historical Association in Richmond in De? cember next, Mrs. Stanard's volume is indispensable. Other histories of Richmond there are, and worthy, too; but into this single volume Mrs. Stanard has focused all the light, beauty, and romance of Virginia's capital. Some of the high lights in the picture are the account of the three William Byrds, the slave insurrections, Marshall and his coterie of friends, the trial of Aaron Burr, the " brush with England " in 1812, the steamboat that plied on James River in 1815 at the astounding rate of four miles an hour, John Randolph of Roanoke, an exquisite study of Poe, and the story of the War between the States. S. C. Mitchell. The Food Administration in Iowa. By Ivan L. Pollock. [lowa Chronicles of the World War.] In two volumes. (Iowa City, State Historical Society of Iowa, 1923, pp. xvi, 235; xvi, 239, $2.00 each.) The author states that the purpose of this work is " to recount the ac? tivities of the Food Administration in the State of Iowa". He adds that it is important that this should be done " while the materials con- cerning these war-time activities are available in the original form". Whether or not this can be done with proper historical perspective might be open to question but certainly every one who has had first-hand knowledge of the treatment of the manuscripts and documents in Wash? ington since the World War will approve of Dr. Pollock's efforts to pre- serve in book form at least one fragment of those records. As a study in war organization and administration the work is a valuable one. Although disclaiming any intention of writing a history of the United States Food Administration as a whole, the author has found it necessary to devote the first chapter to a summary of that na? tional organization as a proper setting for the detailed account of the Iowa division. Each state acted as a separate unit of the federal Food Administration and, although guided by regulations and advice from Washington, handled state problems in accordance with local conditions. Allowing for these local differences, the general organization within all the states was quite similar and a description of what transpired in</page><page sequence="29">614 Reviews of Books Iowa affords a fairly good picture of the workings of the Food Ad? ministration in any state. Because of the many and diverse activities of the Food Administra? tion a strictly chronological narrative is practically out of the question. Dr. Pollock has wisely divided the field of study according to subject- matter and, after giving an account of the Iowa organization as a whole, has discussed in more detail each of the branches of its work. He has turned for his materials to the documentary sources, primarily those in the files of the Food Administration in Washington, whither state rec- ords were sent at the close of the war. The notes and references ap- pended to each volume form a valuable bibliographical guide for future investigators, not merely for Iowa but for the country at large. Iowa had much of which to be proud in her accomplishments in the field of food production and food conservation and the story is well told. Dr. Pollock has not allowed himself to be blinded by state pride but has conscientiously pointed out the weaknesses and failures of the Iowa Food Administration, as well as its successes. In addition to the bibliographical notes, to which reference has al? ready been made, the appendix contains a list of the personnel of the Iowa Food Administration. There is a complete index. The volumes are exceptionally neat in appearance and attractively printed. Everett S. Brown. Origin of Washington Geographic Names. By Edmond S. Meany. [Republished from the Washington Historical Quarterly, Seattle, Wash? ington, 1917-1923.] (Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1923, pp. ix, 357, $3.00.) This is a complete list of 2045 place-names of the state of Washington, compiled by Edmond S. Meany, professor of his? tory in the University of Washington, author of several works on the history of that state, and editor of the Washington Historical Quarterly, published at Seattle. Mr. Meany's assistant in gathering the material was Victor J. Farrar, instructor in history in the University of Wash? ington. Pioneer settlement of Washington state began eighty years ago; exploration and fur-trading had preceded settlement by fifty years. Many place-names now in use are echoes of these several periods, and Mr. Meany's history of the names furnishes a record of much value for general reference. This book is the only general source of information yet compiled, pertaining to the local names of Washington state. The names listed in the work are thus classified as to origin: from personal names, 824; from physical features, 399; from Indian names, 386; from other place-names, 191; from crops, trees, animals, and birds, 115; from freak names, 68; from Spanish names, 33; from American ships, 17; from British ships, 6; from Biblical names, 6.</page><page sequence="30">Minor Notices 615 The work uses facts drawn from many available authorities: printed histories, government records, pioneer memoirs and manuscripts, maps, diaries, legislative acts, Indian treaties, and personal letters. The data thus compiled have been appearing serially in the pages of the Washing? ton Historical Quarterly during the last six years, and are now put into the form of a bound book. All work on the earlier names of the alpha- bet, therefore, was done some years ago, and no corrections or ampli- fications seem to have been made for this final publication. The book may be criticized for errors of detail and for incomplete or suppositious information. For example: John Day, the Astorian who died in Idaho in 1820, is said to have died at Astoria in 1812 or 1813; Marcus Whitman, who was killed by Cayuse Indians, is said to have been killed by Walla Walla Indians; the name Chinook, now used as that of a town and a river, is said to have " disappeared"; the site of Vancouver, Washington, chosen by Governor Sir George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company in the winter of 1824-1825, is said to have been selected by Chief Factor John McLoughlin; Colville, a modern town, is confused with Fort Colville, of the Hudson's Bay Company, twenty miles distant; in the origin of Spokane, one of the earliest and best authorities is omitted, the Henry-Thompson Journals, and the name, originally that of Little Spokane River, is said to have been applied to the present river of that name, which was the Skeetshoo. It may be suggested that too much credence is given to local tradition and to modern interpretation of Indian testimony, which is hardly ever reliable; also to personal letters from local postmasters and others. These criticisms, however, are incidental, and do not impair the gen? eral usefulness of this important book. Mr. Meany's enterprise and in? dustry have created a work in advance of any competitor in his field, and in subsequent editions he may expand and enhance the references. Leslie M. Scott. Government of the West Indies. By Hume Wrong, Assistant Pro? fessor of Modern History in the University of Toronto. (Oxford, Clarendon Press; London and New York, Oxford University Press, Humphrey Milford, 1923, pp. 190, 10 s. 6 d.) The design of this book is to trace the constitutional development of the British West Indies and to exhibit their present political problems. " It is based only on the more easily accessible of printed records, and it is intended to be no more than an outline." Mr. Wrong has achieved the purpose thus defined. He reviews social conditions before 1833 and describes the old representative system which prevailed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Characterized by wasteful friction between executives responsible to the crown and legislatures elected by freemen, the system was never- theless a workable adjustment to a society resting on slavery. Emancipa- tion transformed the whole economic and social order and necessitated AM. HIST. REV.. VOL. XXlX -40.</page><page sequence="31">616 Reviews of Books eventually a readjustment of a large portion of the constitutional struc- ture. The white oligarchy, resenting emancipation, was neither disposed nor competent to achieve reconstruction. Only in Barbados, the Bahamas, and Bermuda has the representative system survived. Elsewhere crown colony government was instituted. Mr. Wrong distinguishes the varieties of such government, traces the evolution in each colony, and shows the defects of the federal experiments in the Leeward and Windward Islands. The last two chapters outline present constitutional problems. The author canvasses proposals for consolidating the eight governments, deeming most of them impractical?including that of annexing the West Indies to the Canadian Dominion as colonies. He sketches the substantial improvement in economic status of the negroes and the meagre oppor- tunities for their growth in political capacity. He justifies in the main the record of colonial autocracy in a society where representative govern? ment became impossible, but shares the optimism of Olivier, Wood, and others who foresee the necessity of recreating self-government. As for cabinet government no one imagines it feasible; responsibility must reside in the Colonial Office for years to come. The brief list of authorities should have provided more guidance to the constitutional sources?council and assembly minutes, legislation, and offkial reports; the secondary authorities should include Egerton's paper on Jamaican constitutional development in the Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, fourth series, I. 190-217, and Eugene Sice's Btude sur les Colonies de la Couronne Britannique: les Antilles Anglaises (Paris, 1913). It is to be hoped that Mr. Wrong's manual, brief as it is, yet sound in method and judgment, may serve as a point of departure for more exhaustive studies in West Indian history. Frank W. Pitman. Spanish Colonial Literature of South America. By Bernard Moses, Ph.D., LL.D., professor emerittis in the University of California. (New York, the Hispanic Society of America, 1922, pp. xviii, 661.) The Spanish colonial writings of the seventeenth century were perhaps equal in merit and importance to those of English America, and were preceded by a mass of interesting, sometimes brilliant, writings of the sixteenth century to which English America affords no parallel. The Spanish colonial literature of the eighteenth century would probably be judged inferior to that of the English colonies. But in any case, the whole theme deserved treatment in a form readable by those who read only English, and Professor Moses, with his remarkable learning in the whole field of the history of Spanish America before independence, has sup- plied the need in excellent fashion. All the important writers, whether of poetry, history, geographical description, or legal or ecclesiastical discussion, in each province and age, are noted, their biographies given, their works described, with interesting quotations, and appraised?all in</page><page sequence="32">Minor Notices 617 an agreeable and entertaining style. Professor Moses rightly says that, for any real understanding of South American colonial society, what men wrote of their own times or times near their own supplies material that cannot be derived from the formal documents which the modern historian most largely uses. His little book (little, for the pages though numerous are small) will not seem so important as the volumes on co? lonial South America which he has already given us, but supplement them in a useful and happy manner. The bibliographical data are ample, and are supplemented in an appendix by a catalogue prepared by Mr. A. H. Wykeham-George. The illustrations are excellent and the book really beautiful in appearance.</page></plain_text>
