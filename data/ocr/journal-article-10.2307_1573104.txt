<plain_text><page sequence="1">So much for the more positive side; a technical examination reveals a great deal that needs to be replaced or bolstered, as I point out below. There is much of what Kurt Vonnegut has dubbed a 'granfalloon' in the piece. In a mathematical sense, there are many classes in which the noting of similar characteristics among disparate elements may permit the establishment of a common set that has little or no useful properties-e.g. the set of pedestrians or the set of eight-letter words. More formally we are dealing with a Venn-Euler overlap between selected charac- tersitics of art and play and it is tacitly assumed that the existence of an overlap is significant, even to the point of implying important causal and temporal relations. The overlap does not necessarily imply useful, significant relations even among classes of more precise entities (cf., e.g. mathematics, chemistry, taxonomy) much less a somewhat arbitary selection of the characteristics of 'art' and 'play'. Reference to any good dictionary will reveal many widely accepted 'definitions' of the words 'art' and 'play' that may or may not fit the characteristics selected in her article. There are even seeming contradictions, as when she hedges in the same paragraph by saying 'play is not serious' and then goes on to quote with respect to children 'all play is based on anxiety and is the means whereby a child seeks to master it'. Although reference is made to 'metacommunications', the article is surprisingly unconcerned with meta con- siderations and semantic problems arising from real intent not just etymological quibbling. The meta role of attitudes as they vary with time and involvement may be dominant rather than recessive. When a friend says that he relaxes by 'working in his garden' and Fischer and Spassky were said to be 'playing chess', there is certainly a difference in intent but little doubt as to meanings. Gardening can become 'not-play' for a person forced into commercial farming and there may have been a time when Fischer found chess to be 'play' in the simple sense. Criteria based on seriousness, usefulness, pleasure- orientation and other characteristic noted by the author do not provide an adequate syndrome-especially over a period of time sufficient to invoke phylogenetic concepts. Hero of Alexandria's steam-driven toy seems to have been a progenitor of the modern steam engine. In a strict and legal patent sense, certain dood- lings may be offered as evidence of the date of concep- tion of an invention. How often does one describe one's doodlings as 'just playing', if nothing comes of them, or as important disclosures of something potenti- ally valuable, if they prove prophetic? The pleasure of success may be quite independent of the medium and may be derived or not derived from the 'same' game for different reasons at different times in the career of the 'same' individual-the 'same' ontogenic situa- tion. Similarly, I do not think that enough attention is given to the role of 'art' as a form of religious tribute and as a counter to the oppressiveness (to many) of mortality concepts-'of when I may cease to be'. Much of the enjoyment of 'play' in spectator sports (such as baseball, soccer, football, basketball, boxing etc.) derives, I believe, from witnessing in hours or minutes the decisive resolution of a fairly complex situation depending on both skills and random events. There is little haunting of the vicarious 'player' by such after-thoughts as 'what does it all mean?', 'is it true?', 'what can I do to make something more beautiful ?' etc. Often 'play' delights in transients and 'art' tries to preserve time and times. In fairness, I must admit that Dissanayake could not possibly encompass in any article of reasonable length all the important points that I and other readers might conjure up. Yet, I remain disturbed by the 'gran- falloon' aspect. I believe that I could make an equally not-quite-convincing case for other dyads than 'art- play', such as 'art-religion', 'art-science', 'art-com- merce', 'art-communication', 'play-science', 'play- commerce', 'art-dreams', 'play-dreams', etc. If we cannot get past the 'granfalloon' hurdle, it is even more questionable as to whether there is a signifi- cant temporal and/or causal relation between the set of 'play' members of the Venn-Euler overlap and the 'art' members. Even if one posits the situation of the overlap being significant, it is not clear how one can say that the greater time of ontogenetic phenomena is more appropriate than the lesser time of phylogenetic pheno- mena-especially since one is dealing with thoughts rather than creatures and thoughts can, though not necessarily, evolve more rapidly than the creatures who carry them. The seeking of unifying concepts through ethology is appealing to me, since I have much more confidence in observations that apply to many creatures rather than just man. However, I am not sure that the charac- terizations of 'art' and 'play' provided in this article are not anthropomorphic concepts, so that, almost by definition, ethology may not be able to make a sub- stantial contribution to her subject. In the instant sense, are the terms 'art' or 'play applicable to other creatures? Are the exquisite ultraviolet patterns of flowers an 'art' form? Does that great survivor, the common roach, get involved in either 'art' or 'play'? As a final point, I must bring up the scientist's con- cept of an 'hypothesis'. Philosophically stated, a good hypothesis provides an improved understanding of what we already know and verifiable predictions regard- ing the outcome of experiments yet to be performed. The subject article requires at least more elaboration in this respect. I know that it is easier to be critical than wise. 1 hope that Dissanayake and others will be encouraged if not provoked to pursue and publish provocative articles of this type. I believe that it was Pliny the Elder who said words to the effect: 'If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter'. Myron A. Coler 1 Fifth Ave., Suite D New York, NY 10003, U.S.A. ON RONCHI'S 'NEW OPTICS' Vasco Ronchi [1] and I agree that a new optics is needed but we disagree on what it should be. I hope he will not mind if I take this opportunity to state the differences between his theory and mine. There is a sort of suppressed controversy among physicists as to whether optics should be concerned entirely with radiant energy or should somehow include consideration of the eye and the fact of vision. Ronchi believes the latter. Most physicists believe the former. When Ronchi's book, Optics, the Science of Vision [2], was reviewed in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, that pillar of the orthodox establishment, the reviewer remarked in an off-hand manner that the eye really had no place in optics, except as it might be 382 Letters</page><page sequence="2">It is even possible to suggest that this is what a picture itself does in a sense-sample the invariants in an ambient optic array. The painter and the caricaturist are interested mainly in the invariants. The artist selects a sample, chooses his emphasis, and then freezes it in time [3]. The invariants, strange to say, are 'formless' [4]. Ronchi is trying to do what nearly every student of vision since Kepler has been trying to do, explain the perception of the environment in terms of the perception of pictures of the environment. Our ordinary perception is supposed to be mediated by the retinal picture just as the gallery-goer's perception is mediated by the painter's picture. But surely this has the whole thing backwards. We have to explain the perception of the world before we can begin to talk about the special kind of perception of the world that is made possible by a picture. Acquaintance at second hand is quite possible but it rests on acquaintance at first hand. That is why ecological optics is needed instead of more elaborations of pictorial optics with cameras and pro- jectors, and picture planes, and fixed station-points. It is good to have the issue formulated clearly. If the reader will compare Ronchi's book [2] or his most recent monograph [5] with the chapters on vision in my book, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems [6], he will be faced with two kinds of optics at two entirely different levels of discourse and two theories of per- ception that are irreconcileable. He then can make his choice. References 1. V. Ronchi, Perspective Based on a New Optics, Leonardo 7, 219 (1974). 2. V. Ronchi, Optics, the Science of Vision (New York: University Press, 1957). 3. J.

VIOLENCE WITHOUT CAPRICE IN 'NO-ART' If Boris Lurie thinks his rejoinder in this issue of the journal (Leonardo 7, 343 (1974)) destroys the points I raised about NO-Art (Leonardo 5, 325 (1972)) as a current phase in art, it should get a hearing and your readers can decide whether it does or not, without my pointing out weaknesses I consider obvious. However, I cannot let stand without protest the unfounded accusa- tion in his penultimate paragraph that I advocate cultural dictation. Without the words he gratuitously puts into my mouth ('concentration camps' and 'au- thoritarian') and the unwarranted connotations he seems to attach to the words he has italicized, my statement in its proper context is defensible on egalitar- ian and socially progressive grounds, as is my personal record of social dedication in art and otherwise for several decades. thought of as an optical instrument. Ronchi is thus regarded as an eccentric by the majority of his colleagues in the U.S.A. They are a dogmatic lot. The rest of us welcome a physicist with the courage to speak up about the philosophy and the psychology of vision. But he must take the risk of being called wrong. I think he is deeply and seriously wrong. His new optics and my new optics, which I call 'ecological', are at opposite poles. He seems to believe that the only real world is the world of atoms. I believe that the real world is an environment of surfaces. His physics is atomic physics, my physics is that of the geographer or the carpenter. For him, objects of use are ghosts. For me, objects of use are more real than atoms. For him, radiant light from a point-source is important. For me, ambient light at a point of observa- tion is important. He reduces ambient light to rays and points. I assume that ambient light yields an array with invariants of structure over time. He has to conclude that rays carry no information about the layout of surfaces from which they come. I conclude that the structured array carries inexhaustible information about the layout of meaningful surfaces. For him, perception is an act of constructing the phenomenal world on the basis of insufficient evidence. For me, perception is the act of picking up the information that is always avail- able in an illuminated medium. His epistemology is some kind of subjective idealism. Mine is direct realism. A philosophy of subjective idealism is not a handicap for a physicist and it has the advantage of being intel- lectually stimulating. But it is mischievous for a psychologist or an artist and it wastes effort. We learn to perceive the world, not to imagine it. Ronchi is attracted to the old theory that we project our retinal sensations outward into space and imagine a ghostly object there. There are too many facts of psychology that contradict this dcctrine to make it even faintly plausible. Ronchi asks why perceptions are so constant when sensations are continually changing. The puzzle of size constancy is one form of this question. Psychologists have been trying to explain size constancy without success for more than a century, assuming that the brain or the mind somehow compensates for the size of the retinal picture of an object. There are volumes on the subject. But the puzzle arises only if retinal sensations are taken to be the original basis of visual perception. If they are not, there is no puzzle. The falsity of the puzzle becomes apparent when it is realized that what the ocular system does is register invariants of structure, not 'images' of things. Which brings us to the consideration of pictures and perspective, a muddle. The picture of an object, said Isaac Newton, is painted on the back of the eye by rays of light. What a metaphor! An eye is compared to a camera, an optical instrument of the mind. Here lies the source of the muddle. The metaphor is deeply misleading. It certainly does not apply to the com- pound eye of the bee, for example. But it has been repeated in every textbook of optics for centuries, and never even questioned, for lack of a better theory of what an eye does. What an eye does, I suggest, is sample the invariants in an ambient array. An eye does not 'form an image' in the way a darkened chamber with a lens does. The eye works best when the observer moves about in the environment and when he looks around-under conditions when a photographic camera does not work at all.
