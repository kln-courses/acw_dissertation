London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1895. Pp. viii., 356. THIS is a charming book to read but a hard one to review, for it is not only not systematic, but wilfully unsystematic. Mr Balfour disputes all systems and sets up none of his own. This makes the critic's office not less but more difficult for a man who has had very little time to give to philosophy for a dozen years past; and I am emboldened to undertake such an office only by two considerations; first, that although a reviewer in M1ind is answerable for his own opinions, the Editor is answerable for the reviewer being there; secondly, that Mr Balfour himself is not a philosopher by profession, and therefore there may be a certain appropriateness in his book being reviewed by an amateur. As an amateur I take leave to put forward among his merits one that has nothing to do with the validity of his argument or the correctness of any conclusion ex- pressed or implied by him. Whatever may be the next vital move- ment in philosophy here or elsewhere, Mr Balfour will have done much to bring back the good days of Berkeley and Hume when philosophy could speak English. Mr Balfour's arguments, or some of them, may be misconceived, but nobody can call them obscure; we may not be able to dance to his tunes, but the instrument is admirably played. Whoever accepts his challenge, therefore, is bound to deliver an answer in terms that educated Englishmen can understand; and already those philosophers who have replied to Mr Balfour Xseem to have been stirred into surpassing themselves in direct and clear exposition. There is something more and better in this than literary satisfaction. For lucid speech and writing are at least considerable helps to lucid thinking; and when the leading part in philosophy comes round again to men who think and write in English, as I suspect it will ere long, Mr Balfour will deserve grateful remembrance, if it were only for this contribution to our discipline. Whatever judgment we may form of the definable results, Mr Balfour's critical work is of the kind that sets people recasting their thoughts and distinguishing between what they really think and what they have only taken over as 'current teaching,'</page><page sequence="2">A. J. BALFOUR: The Foundations of Belief. 377 orthodox or unorthodox. That, at all events, is pure good for every- body who has begun to think at all. I could wish the reader to carry this much along with him, and also to remember that in philosophy frank disagreement is the next best thing to agreement. For while I enjoy Mr Balfour's dialectic throughout, and especially where he pricks various windbags of con- fused thinking as little connected (under Mr Balfour's favour) with any real science as with any real philosophy, it would be saying that which is not if I were to profess agreement either with his drift in general, so far as I apprehend it, or with much of his reasoning in particular. Using the privilege of an amateur, I will begin at the end. My first complaint is that the book has either too much of an end or too little; too much for the speculative and too little for the practical reader. Mr Balfour's arguments range over the ultimate grounds of certainty in physical science, the inadequacy of natural science as a substitute for philosophy, the claims of modern idealism to explain the universe, the dangers of trying to rationalize theology inito an extension of science, and the relations of reason (or, as I should prefer to say, actively formed opinion) to authority (or rather, as I should say, passive or dependent opinion) in the practical for- mation of conduct and habit: and all, on Mr Balfour's own showing, for what? For the sake of establishing some kind of presumption, on a mixture of speculative and practical grounds, in favour of some such account of the relations of man to God and the world as is offered by Christian theology, and (it would seem) by that species of it which is approximately defined by the Anglican tradition of the last two centuries, and (one may guess if not distinctly infer) by that variety which commends itself to the modern school of moderate High Churchmen. It is for theologians to say whether they find much in this to be thankful for. If they do, they must expect at the hands of secular philosophers the obvious comment that within living memory they have become content to give thanks for rather small mercies. As for the plain man who wants to be confirmed in his faith, I have no doubt that a certain number of most worthy persons have derived great comfort from being told that Mr Balfour has written a brilliant book which leaves the wicked nmen of science and the cobweb-spinning philosophers with never a leg to stand on. And this may; for aught I know, be in its relative sphere a legitimate application of the principle of Authority. These good people will be made happy, and it will make no difference to philosophy. But will a plain Anglican layman, after really perusing Mr Balfour's discus- sion, think he has got much nearer to finding the tortoise that supports his particular elephant? He will learn that natural science has not found the tortoise (which no competent man of science ever pretended to do). He will also learn, if he faces the chapter of small print, that idealist philosophers have not found it either (which would be a pretty odd thing, since, unless I wholly misunderstand the aim of modern critical philosophy, it is to show that there is no M. 25</page><page sequence="3">378 CRITICAL NOTICES. tortoise at all, nor any need to invent one). He will also learn, in a delightfully written chapter, that nobody can expect to know the ultimate reasons for most of the beliefs or disbeliefs he acts on, or, to put it concretely, that a good navigating officer is not necessarily or even probably qualified to demonstrate the Lunar Theory, direct the Greenwich Observatory, and edit the Nautical Almanack (which is excellent common sense, but, as I humbly con- ceive, not relevant in a metaphysical argument). And finally it will appear to the good man that nobody can prevent him from going to church if he likes, and that he may proceed to the study of theology (Hebrew, Ante-Nicene, Roman, Anglican, Mahomedan, or the com- parative study of all or some of them?) without being set down for an antediluvian bigot: which, if he be a man of sense, he might have known before. For my part, I have long thought, herein agreeing with Mr Balfour, that when we get beyond the region of exact proof (or, to speak by the card, the region of things generally treated as admitting of it), belief is, except in the rarest cases, a matter of intellectual and moral temperament far more than of reasoning. And I know not what business one has to meddle with another man's choice of what he finds edifying, or, in Mr Balfour's phrase, tending to the satisfaction of his ethical needs: provided, of course, that he will treat one with reciprocal comity, and that his gods do not require him to kidnap one for sacrificial purposes, or perform disgusting rites in public, or otherwise run his head against other people's ethical needs as embodied in the institutions of a civilized commonwealth. No man can be compelled to philosophize; and God forbid that anyone should, for there is quite enough bad philosophy in the world without making it compulsory. We may speculate or not as we please. Nevertheless, if we do begin the game, we shall get no credit or profit in any other way than by playing it out. It is not only unfair but unsportsmanlike to fall back from the universal upon the individual point of view, and try short cuts of presumption and authority; one might as well go mountaineering with a balloon. Comimon sense is common sense, and a necessity. Philosophy is philosophy, and a luxury. It .ultimately justifies and is justified by common sense; in fact it is common sense learning to know itself. But any premature mixture of the two'is a thing of naught. I cannot help thinking that in this respect a certain undercurrent of sophism runs through Mr Balfour's argument. It may be very fit for John Stiles, having such and such occupations, interests, and means of knowledge, to accept the traditions of his church or his political party more or less upon trust. For example many persons follow Mr Balfour in Irish politics without pretending to know much about Ireland, because they do know and trust Mr Balfour; and, being myself a convinced Unionist, I naturally think they do well. But this proves nothing about the intrinsic merits of the Home Rule controversy. So it is -in exact or partly exact science. An unlearned Florentine living</page><page sequence="4">A. J.

Yet most of the information he got from Dante would have been wrong. Again, as lawyers know, the owner of stolen goods may have reasonable and probable cause, upon circumstances of suspicion, for prosecuting a person who turns out to be innocent. The determination of what a man has to act upon here and now is a perfectly distinct matter from the determination of absolute truth, or the nearest approxi- mation attainable by human faculties: and I think Mr Balfour would have done hinmself more justice if he had paid more attention to the distinction. He may have given the plain man some good reasons for being content to guide himself by authority; he has not given him any great assistance, that I can see, towards satisfying himself, among conflicting authorities, which is to be received and believed. From the point of view of a speculative student I feel a little jealous of the dignity of philosophy when I see her treated as something less than a handmaid. It was an honourable post enough to be the handmaid of theology when theology was the serene mistress and sovereign of all the sciences. But Mr Balfour's philosophy is not a maid of honour nor even an indoor servant; she is rather a sort of half-grown drudge that scrubs the dirt of ' Naturalism ' from the doorstep and cannot tell us what the house is like inside. Shall we dance attendance before a shut door when we can ramble with Plato, or sit by the fountain in Berkeley's garden, or fly clean over the house on Fichte's hippogriff? It seems to me that metaphysics are amply justified, for those who like them, by the intellectual delight and discipline, and that playing for the satisfaction of ethical needs, or any other stakes of supposed practical value, is apt to spoil the game. I am quite aware that many philosophers, perhaps the majority, have encumbered them- selves with foregone moral purposes; but I am likewise persuaded, though I cannot here attempt to prove it, that their philosophy has almost always been the worse for it. Not that I think it unphilo- sophical to appeal to ' ethical needs,' in so far as they can be disengaged from the historical accidents of race, environment, and custom, and exhibited as universal. For they are at least an appreciable element of the human experience which it is the business of philosophy to explain. This appears to me (and so far, again, I am with Mr Balfour) a perfectly good objection to materialism and to every attempt to make natural science do duty for philosophy; but perhaps the chief use of the objection is that the ordinary educated reader thinks he can understand it, for materialism really gets involved in hopeless confusion and contradiction at a much more elementary stage. At what stage we can profitably appeal to ethical needs when we are taking philosophy seriously, and how much preliminary sifting our conceptions of them require, is Matter for a philosopher's main work and not for an amateur's review. Mr Balfour seems, however, not to have quite appreciated the gravity of 25-2</page><page sequence="5">380 CRITICAL NOTICES. this task. He has gone some way in specifying the ethical needs which, as he thinks, ought to be satisfied by theology or philosophy, or by both in some unspecified form of alliance. I have no wish, for many reasons, to discuss his views or suggestions in a contro- versial manner, and shall take a less direct, but, I think, a legitimate way with them. A venerable and still valiant champion, Dr Martineau, has replied to Mr Balfour on this very ground', and Mr Balfour'a conception of ethical needs not only fails to be accepted by Dr Martineau, but is positively rejected by him on certain points which, as I believe and Mr Balfour too seems to think, are reckoned fundamental in orthodox Christian theology. Mr Herbert Spencer' has not on the present occasion expressed himself on this head, being concerned rather to say that he seeks truth and not ' satis- faction'; but I think the whole effect of what Mr Spencer has written on Ethics gives warrant enough for saying that he would hold not only the accidents but the substance of Mr Balfour's ' ethical needs' bad for anthropomorphism. Again, I do not think any one acquainted with our modern philosophical literature will maintain that Mr Herbert Spencer's own higher ethical needs can be more easily reduced to common terms with Dr Martineau's than with Mr Balfour's. Here then are three highly educated Englishmen, representing between them a large field of both contemplative and active life, and, we may presume, agreeing for all or most practical purposes of our common social morality. But when we come to formulate the ethical needs which a complete moral philosophy may be expected to satisfy or justify, no two of them seem to agree. By going further afield we might easily multiply the divergence. At Benares, the winter before last, I visited a Brahman sage of great sanctity and most distinguished manners (and to look distinguished with no clothes to speak of does not seem easy to Europeans). He was as perfect a gentleman and had as impressive an air of refined wisdom as, let us say, Dr Martineau himself. If this learned Brahman believes in his own Vedantic school of philosophy, as I suppose he does, for he has written treatises of it in very choice Sanskrit, the daily burden of his meditation is not fame, not conscious happiness, not personal immortality, but deliverance from the illusions of individuality and finite existence. Why are not his 'ethical need',' on the face of them, as good as ours? They are the guide of life to a vast population of all ranks, from princes to, beggars, and they are embodied in a ' current teaching' more ancient and not less consistent than that of Christendom. It would seem that, whatever may be the true explanation of these differences between cultivated minds, we have not yet arrived at any such determination of the reasonable man's ethical needs as will afford a sufficient basis for the construction of any super-scientific system, 1 Nineteenth Century, April, 1895. 2 Fortnightly Review, June, 1895.</page><page sequence="6">A. J. BALFOUR: The Foundations of Belief. 381 or an universal test for the validity of any such system if offered to us by some external authority. But perhaps the historical argument is best here. When the ethical needs of the civilized world, so far as realized in thought, have anything like the apparent clearness and certainty that Mr Balfour seems to credit his own with, the philosopher's occupation in discussing them is gone. For a cor- responding system of belief is then inevitably received without question. This has happened at least once in European history, namely during the earlier Middle Ages, and it is still largely exemplified in Asia. It does not by any means follow that all existing beliefs are equally remote from the truth, or that truth is not to be found. But I submit that we are justified in feeling considerable doubt as to the promise of Mr Balfour's particular short cut. Short cuts are good in philosophy, as in mathematics and in mountaineering-when you have made sure about the other end. And there is good philosophy, at least much that belongs to a needful stage of philosophy, in certain ' New Poems' that were really. new when Mr Balfour and I were young, and which (I dare say he will agree with me) are like to survive many newer poems that have been more loudly praised. Fools! that in man's brief term He cannot all things view, Affords no ground to affirm That there are gods who do! Nor does being weary prove that he has where to rest! So Matthew Arnold's Empedocles. That is not the last word, but surely it is a word that cannot be escaped. The search for truth must be accepted for its own sake, not subject to the condition of finding a satisfaction for this or that supposed need. Else why philosophize at all, or what answer have we to the worldling when he sneers, Cur quis non prandeeat hoc est ? Concerning Mr Balfour's assault on what he calls N-aturalism, which occupies the earlier part of his book, it seems to me on the speculative side that a great deal of it is unanswerable, but that the opinions which he lumps together under that name would now hardly be maintained, collectively or separately, by anybody worth refuting, in this country at any rate. There is a certain resemblance to Butler's' Analogy in the general construction of the argument. Butler said to the Deists of his time: 'your natural religion is itself exposed to all the rationalizing objections that you urge against revealed religion.' Mr Balfour says to the 'Naturalist': 'Dispose of the difficulties that, surround the fundamental ideas of science before you set up those ideas as an insuperable bar to the acceptance of a supernatural revelation.' Both arguments are quite fair and philosophical. Butler's, I think, is now generally though not uni- versally allowed to have been successful as against the school be attacked. In each case the whole field of historical criticism and I evidences'is left open, and remains to be waked before any definite</page><page sequence="7">382 CRITICAL NOTICES. conclusion can be reached. Only Mr Balfour's ' Naturalist' is not, to my mind, anything like as substantial a foe as Butler's Deist. On the practical side I cannot help thinking that Mr Balfour estimates above their true rate both the vitality of what he calls ' current teaching,' that is, the average orthodoxy of the pulpit and the Sunday-school, as a factor actually determining people's habitual conduct as men and citizens, and the extent and intensity of any active repugnance to it. Naturalism, if it means anything definite, means holding that the natural sciences are an adequate substitute for philosophy. The leaders of science and scientific exposition have not held or taught any such thing, Helmholtz no more than Leibnitz or Newton, Tyndall no more than Clerk Maxwell or Faraday, Darwin no more than Owen. I wonder, by the way, how many people in this country know that Tyndall's much misunderstood Belfast address was received as a serious and welcome contribution to the philosophy of science by Riehl, one of the chief recent expounders of Kantian .philosophy in Germany, while theological dabblers in metaphysics were abusing it at random in England? A lesser man than Mr Balfour might amuse himself, for anything one cared, with setting up a philosophico-theological Aunt Sally to throw at. Mr Balfour throws his sticks very prettily, but it is not modern warfare, and one would like to see him doing something better. I do not doubt that there is a real movement in public opinion which is present to Mr Balfour's mind when he describes the supposed ravages of Naturalism: only it strikes me in a different way. Liberal education has gradually come to include some know- ledge of the history of science, of the formation of miethod, and of the progress of discovery. From history, likewise, we learn the rise and fall of religions and philosophies; and as to the latter at any rate Mr Balfour will admit that we do not hear of any of them being thoroughly successful; for Mr Balfour seems almost to take a malicious pleasure in exaggerating the failures of all philosophical schools both ancient and modern. Thus the plain man is put upon observing that those whose business brings them in contact with the sensible nature of things, mariners for example, agree in knowing what they want, and that the methods and discipline of science, in this case represented by the Astronomer Royal and his staff, provide *for their wants with universal approval by publishing the Nacutical A imanack, which has helped many a good ship safely out and home. Whereas, when he observes the expressed needs of mankind in the region of things unseen, he perceives that even educated men living in the same society do not agree in knowing what they want, and that theologians, instead of producing a sinigle accepted Nautical Almanack, have produced a great variety of conflicting systems, formulas, and usages; and that, for the most part, not as provisional or alternative aspects of truths inexpressible in human speech, but each creed as containing the only true and admissible explanation of God and man and the world. He will recognize that several if not all of the conflicting Churches and persuasions have plenty of</page><page sequence="8">A. J. BALFOUR: The Foundations of Belief 383 arguments to prove their exclusive and paramount claims to spiritual allegiance. But this (unless and until he has examined some such argumnent in detail and found it convincing) will not dispose him to think better of them. He miay therefore perhaps conclude, notwith- standing all Mr Balfour's dialectic, that on the whole the men of science have so far shown that they know their business better than the theologians. And, while he may or may not think proper to remain in practical conformity to the Church he was brought up in (this being a matter of private judgment and conscience not redu- cible to general rule), he may become rather indifferent to theological or theologico-political controversies which do not seem to point to something like a new method in religious speculation, or to hold out some promise of establishing foundations not much less firm than those of the natural sciences. I am not stating this as a philosophical position; on the contrary, I wish to point out that it does not involve the acceptance of any philosophical proposition, sound or unsound, an,d is consistent with a genuine absence of prejudice against any particular system. On Mr Balfour's own view of the relations of reason to authority, I caninot see that it is a perverse position for a fairly intelligent man to take, or that it entails any tendency to moral obliquity or to a general collapse of social morality. That it cannot be a permanent position, though it may have to last another generation or more, I quite agree. Moreover it has its dangers, such as that of being beguiled by cheap and flimsy sham philosophies of spiritual worlds or social evolution, masquerading in the clothes of science. Bpt on this we need not dwell. The popular form of Mr Balfour's discussion, combined with the total absence of an analytical table or index (a defect against which a lawyer is always bound to protest) makes it hard to say what Mr Balfour's own philosophical position really is. If I may repeat what I formerly said (in an unsigned review) about his ' Defence of Philo- sophic Doubt,' it seems to be in a certain sense ultra-Kantian. For Mr Balfour, if I rightly follow him, holds not only that Speculative Reason is not competent in the field of Practical Reason, but that it is not competent even to support itself. It is not my business to take up a challenge which Prof. Wallace, an honoured colleague of mine, though in another Faculty, has deliberately left alone'. But I cannot help suspecting that the idealism rejected by Mr Balfour, apparently with some regret, is as unsubstantial an adversary as his naturalism. In our undergraduate days it was a small and harmless practical joke to go into a man's rooms when they were left open and make a kind of scarecrow or eidolon with his boating flannels or any other garments one could find lying about: if you could fashion them into some caricature likeness of the owner, so much the better. Has not Mr Balfour been making an eidolon ill the Master of Balliol's study? I read, in the chapter which the general reader is warned of, that idealism drives each of us to 'the 1 Fortnightly Review, April, 1895.</page><page sequence="9">384 CRITICAL NOTICES. conclusion that in the infinite variety of the universe there is room for but one knowing subject, and that this subject is himself.' It is a long time since I have looked at the Kritik der reinen Vernunft, but I did suppose that Kant, in demolishing the ' empirical Ego',' had once for all exorcised the phantom of ' solipsism' that scares Mr Balfour. A solus ipse is just as abstract and artificial, just as unthinkable in any sound philosophical criticism, as a solus mnundus or Ferrier's ' matter per se.' Finally, I venture to express the hope that we have not seen the last of Mr Balfour's work in this kind. After some reasonable time, which as an amateur of philosophy I should like to put within ten years hence, but as a citizen (for divers good causes not of philoso- phical interest) to postpone for not less than six or seven, he will perhaps consider whether the materials of this book and of the ' Defence of Philosophic Doubt' may not, by relegation of transitory and merely controversial matter to the background, and with something more of a free hand in construction and of just confidence in the positive as well as the negative powers of dialectic, be recast as an intellectual possession more valuable and more lasting than either of them as it now stands.
