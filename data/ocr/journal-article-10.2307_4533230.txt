<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA by WILLIAM L. THOMPSON 1) 2) (Dept. of Biology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Mich., U.S.A.) (With I3 Figures) (Rec. 27-X-I967) Bird song is subject to very strong selective pressure as a primary means of species recognition (MARLER, 1957, 1960; THORPE, 1961). In many species it is a much more fluid character than morphology because of the importance of learning in song development (MARLER, 1960). Nevertheless, just as there is a basic underlying similarity of body structure which makes it possible to group vertebrates into related assemblages in spite of superficial dissi- milarities, there should be similarities in the form of the songs and other vocalizations of related species and groups of species which should parallel the degree of morphological similarity. We might expect closely related species to have more similar songs than distantly related species. This has been shown to be true for the songs of some North American warblers (STEIN, 1962). As part of a much broader study of behavior of the genus Passerina the song patterns of five of the six species have been analyzed. To my knowledge the song of the sixth species, P. rositae, has never been recorded. The genus Passerina is placed in the subfamily Richmondeninae of the family Fringillidae (HELLMAYR, 1938, TORDOFF, 1954).

THOMPSON ciris, the Painted Bunting, P. versicolor, the Varied Bunting, P. leclancherii, the Orange-breasted Bunting, and P. rositae, the Rose-bellied Bunting) is one of the most diverse groups of the richmondenine assemblage. Its breed- ing range extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast and from just north of the Canadian-United States border to just east of the Isthmus of Tehuan- tepec in Mexico. The genus is of particular interest from both behavioral and systematic standpoints because, although the males of the six species are quite distinct and the females are distinguishable in plumage, there are two pairs which are known to form hybrids. Rather extensive hybridization is known to take place between P. cyanea and P. amoena in a fairly wide zone of overlap in the Great Plains area (SIBLEY &amp; SHORT, 1959). A single hybrid between P. ciris and P. versicolor is known from southern Texas (STORER, 1961). Before beginning to discuss the structure of the Passerina songs it is im- portant to state just what is meant by "'song". Vocalizations of the oscines or songbirds are traditionally separated into calls, which are usually rather simple, short vocalizations, and songs, which are longer and more elaborate vocalizations given typically by males in territorial advertising, but also in other contexts (ARMSTRONG, 1963, p. 130). DILGER (1962) has objected to the use of the word "song" since in some birds there is essentially no difference in the form of calls and songs, but the term for the songbirds at least has a long tradition and is very useful. BONDESON &amp; DAVIS (1966) suggest that the "anthropomorphic shade" of the word "song" should be avoided, and suggest "musical composition", but this term suggests much more anthropo- morphic shading to me than "song", bringing to mind the controversy over ape paintings as art, and seems more undesirable than the older term. Usually only male buntings sing but there is one record in the literature of a female Indigo Bunting singing (NOLAN, 1958). There are two rather distinct types of song. Males sing most commonly from prominent song posts, and the song given under these circumstances may be called "adver- tising song" (BORROR, 1961), or "primary song" (LISTER, 1953), or "terri- torial song" (ARMSTRONG, 1963). It seems to have the dual function of territorial proclamation by both unmated and mated males, and advertising for females by unmated males. Male Indigo Buntings which are actually involved in territorial defense, chasing an intruder from the territory, often sing a modified form of the advertising song, the customary elements inter- spersed with high-pitched squeaky sounds (personal observation, and SAUN- DERS, 1951). Not all males use this modified form of song, nor do those which do use it use it consistently in territorial defense. More commonly the territory owner simply sings a longer song, repeating segments of his</page><page sequence="3">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 263 usual advertising song over and over again. In this case no new elements are added, but the structure of the song is considerably changed by the dupli- cation. Ordinarily this exaggerated song and the squeaky song are given only when the intruding male remains in the territory. Male Indigo Buntings give another type of song, a flight song, a rapid, "congested" vocalization (ARMSTRONG, 1963) during a flight display over the male's own territory and on occasion while or just before or after flying over another's territory. Sometimes the normal song is given under these circumstances, but more often the modified form is used. Squeaky songs and distinctive flight songs have not been heard from the other species of Passerina. Often males sing only a portion of their full advertising song while foraging or preening. Singing by a neighboring male or a brief playback of a recorded song will usually stimulate much more vigorous singing, by which I mean longer songs with shorter intervals between songs. It is apparent, then, that song characteristics of a given individual change, depending on the circumstances. These variations in song from within individuals must be considered in any comparison of the songs of different species. The discus- sion of Passerina song characteristics in this paper deals exclusively with the advertising song of the five species. Recordings on which this report is based are all of advertising songs given by males presumably not actively involved in chasing an intruder from the territory, although some of the birds were recorded while singing against a neighbor and some were stimulated to sing by playing a tape recording of a song of their own or of another conspecific individual. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Passerina songs used in this analysis include 832 songs of three species which I recorded in the field, 576 songs of five species obtained from the Library of Natural Sounds at Cornell University and 43 songs of P. cyanea recorded in the field by EDWIN G. BOYES of Detroit. Table 1 presents the source of all recordings used. All songs on these tapes were sonagraphed on a Kay Electric Company model 661-B sonagraph for detailed analysis of the song structure. The sonagraph was set at the high shape, wide band settings. The interval between songs, taken from the end of one song to the beginning of the next was measured with a stop watch as the tape was played at half speed. Intervals were not measured when there was an apparent break in the re- cording between songs. Total length of each song was measured on a sonagram of the song. Some songs were omitted because of indistinct begin-</page><page sequence="4">264 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON nings or endings as a result of wind distortion or other recording defects. High and low frequencies were measured on the sonagrams. The scale for these measurements was prepared from sonagrams of a tape recording of sounds of frequencies of 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 and 8000 cycles/second produced by an audio-oscillator. Poor recording quality made some of the song elements on a few sonagrams indistinct and caused some frequency measurements to be uncertain. In many songs the top of the figures ran off the sonagram, that is, they exceeded 8000 cycles/ second. A sample of each figure in a series of songs of a single individual that exceeded 8000 cycles/second was sonagraphed at half speed and meas- ured, and this measurement was assumed to be valid for this particular figure in every song in the series. Since the elements in the songs of a given individual are quite uniform from song to song this should be a fairly safe procedure. ANALYSIS OF SONGS The songs of all five species are composed of elements or figures of narrow frequency range at any one instant, but varying rapidly ill pitch, so that a given figure, representing a continuous sound emission may have a wide frequency range. The various figures which make up the song of a given species may be characterized by the form of their frequency variation. The simplest form may be found in the short figures at the beginning of some songs (fig. 1, a). These figures seem to represent a single tone, a sound of a single, unvarying frequency. Some figures represent a single increase or decrease in frequency (fig. 1, b and c). Some figures begin with a frequency increase, followed by a decline, giving a single-peaked figure, and the increase may be uniform as in fig. 1, d, or uneven as in fig. 1, e. Some begin with a decrease in frequency, followed by an increase, forming a v-shaped figure on the sona- gram (fig. 1, f). Some continue to increase and decrease in frequency with- out a break in the sound, producing many-peaked figures as in fig. 1, g and h. Some figures represent rapid increases or decreases in frequency repeated several times (fig. 1, i and j). A group of these produces a buzz (fig. 1, k). A figure such as 1, 1 or 1, m represents a frequency modulated wave. In 1 1 the carrier wave begins at 5.2 KC, rises to 5.6 KC while being modulated at 60 c/sec. In m the carrier wave begins at 6 KC, while modulated at 140 c/sec., drops to 5.3 KC, rises rapidly to 7.5 KC, then drops to about 4.2 KC, where it is modulated at 33.3 c/sec. This is shown more clearly in the sonagram of the sound played at one-half the normal speed (fig. 1, n).</page><page sequence="5">Species aF P. cyanea o (cu # I) (CU # 2&amp;3) (CU # 3) (CU # 4&amp;5) (CU # 6) (CU # 7-II) (CU # I2) P. amoena (CU # I) (CU # 2) (CU # 3) (CU # 4) (CU # 5) (CU # 6) (CU # 7) (CU # 8) (CU # 9) (CU # IO&amp;II) P. ciris P. leclancherii 00 P. versicolor (CU # i) (CU # 2) (CU # 3) (CU # 4) (CU # I) (CU # 2) (CU # I) (CU # 3) Recorder E.

THOMPSON A close look at figure 2 reveals that the songs of P. ciris and P. leclancherii are divided into fairly evenly spaced elements. Those of P. cyanea, P. amo- ena and P. versicolor, however, show irregular spacing of the discrete figures. Some of these figures, especially in P. cyanea and P. amoena in which they are typically repeated in twos and threes, seem to be closely associated with others to form compound elements. The P. cya'nea song shown in figure 2 serves to illustrate this. If all similar elements are given letter designations we would have ab ab cd e fg fg hiij hiij klm klm no no pq pq.

Figure n is figure m played at half speed. between h, i and j, etc., is considerably less than that between b and the following a, b and the following c, d and the following c, etc., and suggests that the elements a and b, c and d, etc., represent compound elements. This suggestion that there are two classes of intervals of silence between sounds in the songs of P. cyanea and P. amoena is supported by diagrams of the number of times intervals of different length occur in the songs of each species (fig. 3), using the same sort of analysis as ISAAC &amp; MARLER (1963) used for the songs of the Mistle Thrush. The distribution of intervals in the P. cyanea song shows two main peaks - one at .00 seconds i.e., no measurable time gap between the discontinuous sounds (as between parts of c and between c and d in the cyanea song of fig. 2) and one about .07 second. (7 centiseconds). The smaller intervals separate sounds which seem to go together to form compound figures. The repetition of these groups of</page><page sequence="7">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 267 PASSERINA LECLANCHE RI 6_ 4- P CIRIS 6_ P V ERSICOLOR 62 P AMOENA 64 4- 2- ] 0 5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Fig. 2.

The low point between the two peaks of the distribution is at 3 centiseconds. There is no actual break in the distribution of long and short intervals as IsAAc &amp; MARLER found in the songs of the Mistle Thrush, and so it was not possible to set up an absolute distinction between short intervals (intervals within compound figures) and long intervals (intervals between I8*</page><page sequence="8">268 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON figures) based on the length of the interval alone as ISAAC &amp; MARLER did. Since two of the measurements used in the song analysis are the number of figures and the number of kinds of figures it was important to have a definite criterion for deciding what was a compound figure and what was a group of consecutive simple figures.

Intervals of 2 centi- seconds or less were considered to separate parts of compound figures. If the interval was between 2 and 3 centiseconds in duration it was necessary to</page><page sequence="9">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 269 consider, also, whether or not the grouping of sounds was repeated as a unit. If two sounds separaterd by an interval of more than 2 but less than 3 centi- seconds were repeated as a unit, they were considered to form a compound figure. All figures separated by intervals of 3 or more centiseconds were called separate figures. The distribution of intervals of amoena songs is very similar to that of cyanea in general form, although there is a third peak at 15 centiseconds. The separation between intervals within figures and intervals between figures seems to lie at 1 centisecond. This seems to be in accord with the more rapid sounding song of P. amoena. Here, as in cyanea, there is no actual break in the distribution of intervals of silence, and it was necessary to consider the repetition of the sounds to determine whether particular groups of sounds comprised compound figures or successive simple figures. In P. versicolor there is an actual break between short and long intervals. The intra-element interval for versicolor is 0 centiseconds. The number of songs in the sample of P. versicolor is so small, however, that we can place little confidence in the details of the curve. For ciris the distribution of intervals shows only a faint suggestion of bimodality representing a separation of intervals within compound figures and intervals between figures. There is very little repetition of figures in ciris songs, and very little suggestion of compound figures. There is a sug- gestion of a break in the ciris interval distribution at 1 centisecond, and this has been taken as the separation between the two types of intervals. The leclancherii distribution has a quite different appearance than those of the other species. It resembles ciris in having a very few intervals of less than 2 centiseconds duration. Like ciris, also, there is very little repetition of elements, and little suggestion of compound elements. The broad, flattened curve of leclancherii reflects the slow song of this species as compared with that of ciris. It is useful to have a term to refer to the continuous sounds which make up the bird song, whether they be simple figures of parts of a compound figure. I have used the term syllable in the sense of Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam Co., 1951) as a sound "constituting an un- interrupted unit of utterance." This is not the meaning of the word syllable as it has been used by some others recently in describing bird song (MARLER &amp; ISAAC, 1961; MULLIGAN, 1963), but this use of the term seems more consistent with its general meaning. Songs of some species contain no duplication of figures, while others contain figures repeated two, three, four or even five times. Repetition, or lack of it, is fairly consistent within each species. In order to measure the</page><page sequence="10">270 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON degree of repetition, a repetition index, the ratio of the number of figures to the number of kinds of figures, was computed for each species. A repe- tition index of 1 would indicate no repetition. Repetition indices of 1.5, 2 or more would indicate increasing amounts of repetition. Passerina leclancherii has no repetition, or an index value of 1.0, and P. amoena has the greatest amount of repetition with an index of 1.95. Passerina ciris, P. versicolor and P. cyanea are intermediate, with indices of 1.01, 1.60 and 1.61, respec- tively. This is illustrated in another way in Table 2 in which the number of times a given figure is sung within a single song is shown. There is a steady increase in the number of times figures are given from le;clancherti to amoena. P. LECLANCHERII AND P. CIRIS SAUNDERS (1951) calls the ciris song "a high-pitched, sweet, but thin, tinkly song". BORROR (1961) called it " series of warbled or wavering phrases, successive phrases usually being different". The ciris song represents a series of separate, mostly simple figures which tend to alternate from high frequency to low frequency as can be seen in the three ciris songs illustrated TABLE 2 Element Repetition in Single Songs (# songs) (#birds) Per cent figures given one or more times in song I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Io leclancherii I8 3 I00 ciris 457 31 98.89 I.09 0.02 versicolor 2 I 6o 20 20 cyanea 5o6 26 43.21 58.85 3.2I 2.05 o.o6 0.04 amoena 366 30 38.44 4I.45 I2.35 3.39 3.39 0.90 0.00 0.04 0,00 0,04 in fig. 4. Most of the sounds themselves, when played slowly or analyzed with the sonagraph can be seen to vary in pitch in the same up and down manner, but these changes in pitch are too rapid to be perceived clearly by the human ear when they are given at normal speed. The pitch changes produce a slurred sound for each element as BORROR (1961) pointed out. The elements of the leclancherii song show this same alternation of one element lying high in the range with another lying lower in the range, but the wide separation of the elements gives the song a disjunct quality. The leclancherii song is given at an average rate of 3.64 figures per second as compared with 6.46 figures per second in ciris. Both P. leclancherii and P. ciris characteristically show no repetition of elements, but some ciris songs do repeat elements. The repetition here in most cases is not given immediately after the first presentation of the sound,</page><page sequence="11">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 271 but occurs later in the song. Thus, there is no pairing of elements as in cyanea and amoena. One song recorded at the Welder Refuge near Sinton, Texas, however, did include a paired repetition of one element. Repetition of any sort is so rare in ciris, nevertheless, that the repetition index of 1.01 for the species is very close to the 1.00 of leclancherii. In a single bout of singing songs of several different patterns may be sung, more or less alternately. A series of ciris songs recorded at Beaufort, South Carolina by M. P. MCCHESNEY, for example, included four distinct A 6- _ South~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Caroin,! (b) Sitn TXas and (c) Sal PlainsX, Okaoa 61 0 5 :1. X . 5 9 2. 0 Fig. 4.

Some birds sing one pattern more frequently than the others, but there is still intermingling of the patterns in a single bout of singing. As the sequence described above illustrates, there is no fixed sequence of the patterns. For 481 songs of 31 ciris males the mean number of song types per individual is 4.45. Typically the longer series of songs included more song patterns. The citis songs which I recorded at the Welder Refuge, Sinton, Texas, in 1964 represent 22 individuals in a large population. Most of these individuals were located near each other. The sonagrams indicate some sharing of elements</page><page sequence="12">272 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON between individuals, but the sample includes no instances of shared complete patterns from one bird to another, as has been demonstrated in P. cyanea (THOMPSON, 1966).

CYANEA AND P. AMOENA MATHEWS (1904) described the cyanea song as "series of loud, ringing metallic chirp-notes of very nearly equal value, which slightly diminish in volume as the song nears the end". He described the beginning of the song as a "pianissimo downward chirp" and the remaining elements of the song as a series "which alternates up and down, and finishes with three (some- times two or four) monotone notes which are remarkably suggestive of the words fish, fish, fish!"

THOMPSON scription. "The song of the Indigo Bunting is high-pitched and sibilant, and, though musical in general, there is a slight harshness in its quality. The song consists of single notes, two-note phrases, and sometimes slurs. These are put together in rhythmic groups." PETERSON (1947) indicates that the "notes are usually in twos: sweet-sweet, chew-chew, etc.". Many cyanea songs do, indeed, include sounds like "sweet" and "chew". The pattern of frequency variation which characterizes each figure or group of figures in a compound element gives each element a characteristic sound that is apparent to the human ear. Apparently the "sweet" sound is produced by a rising inflection and the "chew" by a descending pitch. The sonagram of a cyanea song in fig. 2 shows both types of figures. This song sounds to me like sweet-sweet chee-chee chee tweet-tweet chew-chew chichi twee-twee twee-twee. MATHEWS implies and BORROR (1961) specifies that the elements of the song, the "notes" as they call them, are slurred sounds. Although the cyaxnea and amoena songs show the same alternation of an element lying high in the range with one lying low in the range, and to a greater degree than in ciris and leclancherii, the songs of the first two species do not have the warbled quality of the ciris and leclancherii songs because the high and low elements are often placed close together as a compound element and sound to the human ear as one continuous sound. The wide range of pitch is not very apparent to the human ear because the change occurs so rapidly, but some of the pitch changes are slow enough to give the slurred quality to the sound. BORROR (1960) has pointed out that figures of wide frequency spread within a short time interval, such as we find in P. cyanea and P. amoena, sound less "musical" to the human ear than figures having a rather narrow frequency spread. The narrower frequency spread of the individual figures and the slower frequency changes in figures in the ciris song probably account in part for its sounding more musical to SAUNDERS (1951). The amoena song is on the average more rapid than that of cyanea with 6.52 figures per second versus 4.05 for cyanea. These numbers include compound and simple figures. As mentioned previously amoena songs in general show a higher degree of repetition than do cyanea songs, but the modal number of figures is two and some amoena songs contain only paired and single figures. Although the cyanea song is characterized by paired figures it also contains many single figures, and some songs show repetitions of three, four, five or even six times, so there is a broad overlap between the two species in this charac- ter. All individuals in a population do not sing closely similar songs, but rather most sing quite different song patterns. There is, however, considerable</page><page sequence="15">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 275 sharing of elements throughout the population, Song variation in a population of P. cyanea will be considered in a separate paper. Figure 8 illustrates three songs from a single population of cyanea near Pinckney, Michigan. A cyanea recorded in Nevada sang a very typical song consisting of three different elements, the second a very unusual cyanea sound, repeated four to five times (fig. 8, d). 4 _ i I 2-X 6 j0 2 0 D~~~~~~~~~~ 0 S 1.0 1L5 2.0 3.0 Fig. 8.

Intra-individual variation consists largely in dropping one or more elements from the end of the series, or more rarely from the begin-</page><page sequence="16">276 WILLIAM L.

This is probably what BORROR (1961) means when he states that the "songs of a given bird usually vary in the number and types of phrases they contain," although he could be interpreted to mean that a given individual sings different patterns. Figure 9 shows variation in the songs of one cyanea. Figure 10 illustrates the songs of three amoena males, and fig. 11 illustrates some of the variations in the songs of one individual.

One amoena recorded in Baja, California, by L. IRBY DAVIS has two distinct song patterns as shown in fig. 12, a and b. A bird from Austin, Texas, recorded by R. C. STEIN has a very irregular arrangement of ele- ments, so that no two songs in the series of 8 are identical. This bird was recorded in April, and perhaps had not crystallized its final song pattern, although the elements appear too well developed to be called subsong. Figure 12, c-e illustrates three (1, 3, 8) of these different element sequences. The songs of both of these individuals are very atypical of the species.

VERSICOLOR The songs of P. versicolor, judging from the very inadequate sample of two songs for which recordings are available, are intermediate between those of ciris and leclancherii on the one hand and those of cyanea and amoena on the other. There are few compound figures as in ciris and leclancherii, but the simple figures show a very wide frequency range as in cyanea and amoena, so that there is not the warbling quality of ciris and leclancherii. There is repetition of figures as in cyanea and amoena and the repetition index of 1.60 places versicolor close to cyanea. The two songs in the recording available to me are of different patterns (fig. 13), a character- istic of ciris and leclancherii. In general, however, versicolor song seems to be closer to cyanea and amoena than to ciris and leclancherii. Comparison o f the Passerina song characteristics.

The tendency toward</page><page sequence="21">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 281 repetition of figures in amoena, cyanea and versicolor songs is reflected in the much higher figure for the number of figures than the number of kinds of figures. The three song characteristics which show the greatest difference from species to species are number of figures, number of syllables per song, and frequency range, and these are considered separately in Table 4. For each pair of species, Student's t-tests were calculated according to the formula given by SIMPSON, ROE &amp; LEWONTIN (1960). The differences from species to species are generally highly significant. Because of the rather small sample size of leclancherii the statistical significance of the observed differ- ences between it and other species is greatly reduced. A t_E~~~~~~~~_ i: 0 t 5 lO 1.5 Fig. I3. Sonagrams of two songs of one Passerina versicolor male from Sinaloa, Mexico, illustrating song variation within a single individual. To summarize these results we find that cyanea and amoena are very similar in the general form of the elements, in the prevalence of compound elements, and in the tendency for elements to be given in multiples of two or more, i.e., to have a rather high repetition index, and in the limitation of one song type per individual. General features of the songs, such as total length, number of elements, number of kinds of elements, and frequency range, show little difference from species to species. The songs of ciris and leclancherii are very similar in general structure, both having few or no compound elements and both having alternating high and low-pitched elements, giving a warbling quality to the song, especially in ciris. Indi- viduals of both ciris and leclancherii sing several song patterns. The songs of P. versicolor, at least the few examples available to us, are somewhat</page><page sequence="22">282 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON intermediate in form and arrangement of elements between the cyanea- amoena type and the ciris-leclancherii type. DISCUSSION Song structure of Passerina and other species. We find in at least three, and very probably all five species of Passerina considered in this paper that the song organization within the population differs considerably from that found in some other species so far studied and reported in the literature. In the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) (MARLER &amp; TAMURA, 1962, 1964) the songs of all members of a given population are very similar but different populations show consider- able differences in song structure. Cardinals, Richmondena cardinalis, (LEMON, 1965; BORROR, 1961) on the other hand show great variability in song form within a given individual and between individuals, but there is considerable sharing of song types or song patterns between neighbors The buntings seem to differ from both these types in that the individuals of a given population sing different song patterns, but neighbors usually do not share the same song patterns, although there are some exceptions (THOMPSON, 1966). A similar situation seems to exist in Chipping Sparrows. Spizella passerina (BORROR, 1966), Oregon Juncos, Junco oreganus, (KONISHI, 1964), and Song Sparrows, Melospiza melodia, (MULLIGAN, 1963; BORROR, 1961). In cyanea and amoena, unlike Song Sparrows and Oregon Juncos, each individual sings a single song pattern. Individuals of ciris sing several dif- ferent patterns, but the patterns of two neighboring birds are generally dif- ferent. The manner of delivery of the variable songs of P. ciris, alternating the different patterns in consecutive songs, is unlike that of the Song Spar- row (MULLIGAN, 1963), Cirl Bunting and Reed Bunting (THORPE &amp; LADE, 1961), Oregon Junco (KONISHI, 1964), and Chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, (MARLER, 1956), which sing a series of songs of one pattern, then a series of another pattern. Although I have made no extensive study of geographic variation in any of the Passerina species it appears that the songs of widely separated populations are no more different from each other than the indi- viduals of a given population, and, furthermore, similar elements may be found in such widely separated cyanea populations as in New York and Michigan. There is thus no evidence of song dialects such as MARLER &amp; TAMURA found in the White-crowned Sparrow (1962 and 1964). S p e c i f i c d i s t i n c t i v e n e s s i n P a s s e r i n a s o n g s. The interesting case of the song similarities of cyanea and amoena points</page><page sequence="23">SONGS OF FIVE SPECIES OF PASSERINA 283 up very nicely MARLER'S (1957) statement of the importance of specific distinctiveness in behavioral characters. It is clear from the extensive hybridization of the two species that their very marked morphological differences are not sufficient to prevent the formation of mixed pairs. The lack of consistent distinctiveness in the character of songs and calls seems to be especially significant here emphasizing the importance of vocal features in species recognition. Without the reproductive barrier of marked differences in song structure the two forms apparently do not always distinguish each other clearly as separate species. This is unlike the situation described by THORPE &amp; LADE (1961) in emberizine buntings in which there are no two closely related species which cannot be separated on the basis of song alone. Many of the cyanea and amoena songs are clearly distinguish- able, and in field experiments (THOMPSON, unpublished) territorial cyanea males pay little or no attention to recordings of some distinctive amoena songs played within their territories, but some songs of amoena are similar enough to the cyanea type that they elicit attack in a male cyanea, just as if they had been cyanea songs. In Passerina cyanea and P. amoena there is, nevertheless, a partial repro- ductive barrier in the form of morphological differences, or song, or other behavioral features, or perhaps reduced viability or fertility of the hybrids, since the zone of hybridization seems to be limited, and there is not, apparently, a free gene exchange between the two forms to produce a broad zone of intermediates between the indigo and lazuli buntings (SIBLEY, 1961). Significance of shape of song figures. To the human ear the differences in the sound of the songs of the various species is largely a rhythmic difference. The ciris song can be distinguished often by its alternation of high pitched and low pitched sounds to produce a warbled song, but even here there is an apparent rhythmic difference from the measured song of cyanea, or the somewhat faster song of amoena, or the very slow, disconnected sounds of leclancherii. Careful inspection of sonagrams of the songs of the various species reveals that they differ strikingly in the form of the figures, as has been mentioned. These shape differences are probably very important to species recognition by the birds themselves, although they are almost completely indistinguishable to the human ear. PUMPHREY has suggested (1961) that the structure of the song- bird ear gives the bird about ten times the temporal separation of sound pos- sessed by man. THORPE (1963) and GRIFFIN (1953), also, have demonstrated in birds a very rapid auditory reaction time, which suggests a more rapid temporal separation of sound than is possible for the human ear.

They represent a sort of ornamen- tation which would seem likely to have been abandoned during the course of natural selection if it did not serve an important function. Not only is there variation in the form of the figures of different species, to enhance species recognition, but there is also marked individual variation to enhance individual recognition. The great similarity of form of the figures of cyanea and amoena along with the similarities of rhythmic structure and frequency range contribute to the difficulty of species recognition in these two species. A Comparison o f Species on the Basis o f Morphol- ogical and Song Characteristics. Table 5 summarizes several morphological and behavioral characteristics of the five species considered in this paper. Passerina cyanea and P. amoena form a species pair, as is clearly indicated by their morphological similarities and their hybridization. A second pair of species which are morphologically quite similar are P. ciris and P. leclancherii. Passerina versicolor is morphol- ogically somewhat intermediate between P. ciris - P. leclancherii and P. cyaneca - P. amoena in its morphological features. The presumed hybrid between P.versicolor and P. ciris described by STORER (1959) would suggest a rather close relationship between these two species, but there is not the extensive band of interbreeding between these two species which is found between P. cyanea and P. amoena, and furthermore, the females of versi- color are quite different from those of ciris and leclancherii. In general, then, the song structure of the five species rather closely parallels their morphological grouping. It would seem that in these species the evolution of morphological features has proceeded at about the same rate as the evolution of song. This has not been the case in some birds. The species of Phylloscopus, Ph. collybita, the Chiffchaff, an Ph. trochilus, the Willow Warbler, for example, are almost indistinguishable morphologically, but their songs are very different (see MARLER &amp; HAMILTON, 1966, for dis- cussion). Here the evolution of song has evidently progressed more rapidly than that of morphological features. It is likely that the evolution of song would proceed more rapidly, too, in species having well defined song dialects, such as the White-crowned Sparrow, described by MARLER &amp; TAMURA (1962, 1963), than in species such as those of Passerina described in this paper, which seem to have no such distinctive local song types. Behaviour XXXI I9</page><page sequence="26">286 WILLIAM L. THOMPSON SUMMARY A total of I404 advertising songs of five species of Passerina, P. leclancherii, P. ciris,, P. versicolor, P. cyanea, and P. amoenra, were analyzed by measurement of sonagrams. Songs of P. amoena, P. cyanea and P. versicolor characteristically have compound ele- ments, i.e., elements composed of more than one syllable, whereas the songs of P. leclan- cherii and P. ciris typically include only simple elements, elements of only one syllable. Songs of P. amoena, P. cyanea and P. leclancherii have essentially no repetition of elements. Student's t-test of the means of the frequency of each species indicated that the frequency ranges of amoena and leclancherii were very significantly different from each other and from those of cyanea and ciris. The frequency ranges of cyanea and ciris, however, were not significantly different from each other. In general the arrangement of the five species according to similarities in song structure parallels the morphological grouping of the species. REFERENCES ARMSTRONG, E. A.
