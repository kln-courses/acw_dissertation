How did the Scientific Revolution look to its intellectual victims-to those benighted souls who, legend has it, refused even to put their eye to Galileo's new-fangled optical aid? To many literate observers it portended the end of civilization as orthodox thinkers had conceived it for two millenia, and signalled an alienation more frightening than physical death. In this book Timothy Reiss makes a sort of counter-revolutionary effort to revive, or at least sympatheti- cally to understand, the anthropocentric and anthropomorphic wis- dom preceding the discovery of the infinite, empty universe at the other end of Galileo's telescope, and then to show how this wisdom was overthrown. Galileo's magic tube Reiss takes as the central sym- bol of the age, not only through the "epochal gesture" of turning it heavenwards but also through its celebration in Emmanuele Te- sauro's poem of i654, II Cannochiale aristotelico, which paradoxically reflected pre-scientific sense and sensibilities. In general the tele- scope, and the mind-set accompanying it, had resulted in the "dis- tancing" of mind from the world, and of man from himself. What Reiss hopes to accomplish is (adapting one of his own conceits, bor- rowed from Freud) to travel "back up" this instrument, and so to re- gain this lost world of what he terms "patterning, resemblance and myth," which by a complex process of "occultation" had given way to our own world of"analytico-referential discourse." The rise of "modernism" is one of the oldest of subjects, but in this book it is given a new twist and a most fashionable dress. Reiss takes an ostensibly simple notion of intellectual change, essentially from "mythical thought" (with a nod to the "savage mind" of Levi- Strauss) to a new episteme based on naming, enumerating and controlling-empirical and rational science-but then goes on to make it complex by translating his analysis into a very eclectic, quasi- Derridean sort of textualism. Ingeniously but very selectively, Reiss illustrates the rise of modernist discourse mainly through certain works of More, Kepler, Campanella, Bacon, Cyrano de Bergerac, Defoe, Swift and-large textualist leap-Freud. Amidst a jumble of genres, clouds of metaphors, continual buzzing ofJ argon and gener- ous scatterings of insights culled from a larger world of discourse, ancient, medieval and modern, he leads us through many centuries but into only two basic "classes of discourse" which overlapped for a</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 279 generation or so around the seventeenth century. In textualist terms there was no scientific "revolution" but only a gradual, obscuring rather than enlightening, replacement (if this is what "occultation" implies). The shift appeared first in the utopian texts (More, Cam- panella, Cyrano, and Bacon), where the first, the "patterning" class was undermined by the second, the "analytico-referential" class, through a "Euclidean critique of the world." The overlapping of these two classes of discourse is illustrated most strikingly by Kep- ler's Dream (c. i609), which made use of myth and metaphor, while its notes (C. i62I-30) drew attention to the insights and outlook of the "new astronomy." Other authors similarly exhibited a mixture of the old and the new: Montaigne was a "voice of passage," for ex- ample, while Vico in a sense tried, through his own "new science," to reach back from modernity to the old world of patterning. Where can the "occulted dominant discourse practice" be located? Reiss associates it with what he calls the "masculine birth of time," which, advertised most effectively by Bacon (temporis partus masculus is his phrase) but illustrated more subtly by Cyrano, produced a "new kind of dominant certainty." The discourse accompanying (preceding?) this transformation had to be, like the telescope, a "transparent mediator" between thought and reality. This "ideal ex- pressive instrument of European rationalism" was almost a "non- language" literally coterminous with nature itself (like the super- language described by Cyrano, which Reiss mentions, or perhaps Leibniz's "universal characteristic," which he does not). Of course "analytico-referential discourse"- "willful, possessive, authoritar- ian"-was directed to power as well as to truth; and there is a politi- cal implication in Reiss' argument, which is that the new class of dis- course was accommodated to, and conscripted by, not only the new science but also by the "liberal state." Through its naming function this discourse indeed "possessed"; through its enumerating and ana- lyzing function it "controlled"; and so its users closed their eyes to the (feminine?) patterning of old. The "new Adam" envisaged by Bacon was also the economic and political virtuoso of modern soci- ety. The epistemological and narratological aspects of this transfor- mation are illustrated with particular reference to Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver, also by Dickens' Gradgrind, who wanted "only the facts." "Two plus two equals four," Reiss comments, "and the facts add up."</page><page sequence="3">280 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY Reiss's argument for intellectual modernization, set in Derridean terms of "writing," forces him into certain curious and perhaps ques- tionable positions. One is the need to argue for the absolute novelty of modernist discourse and so to deny antique precedents, since these, however rational, lacked the factor of "will" basic to "analytico-referential thought." (In this selective argument, unfortu- nately, Reiss neglects both Sophism and Roman rhetoric, which in- voked reason and yet were often willful to an extreme.) Another cu- riosity is Reiss's inclination to idealize the mythical and patterning world we have lost, lamenting the neglect not only of the self- knowledge which it had offered but also of the attendant virtues of what he allows himself to call "the so-called pseudo-sciences." (We may well agree that the moral costs of modernism suggest the value of another Socratic revolution without accepting all the conceptual baggage and myopia of the pre-Galilean world.) Finally, Reiss argues that Freud represents the culmination of the analytico-referential im- pulse, since, though he revels in the mythical patterning of the sub- conscious (and the pre-rational), he does so only in order to reduce it to a version of the discourse and in this sense to go "back up the telescope." (A generally hopeless task, Reiss thinks, and yet what else does his own book propose to do?) The Derridean assumption-that no meaningful "thought" ex- ists, or at least is accessible, behind the written text-accounts for both the weaknesses and the strengths of Reiss's work. The negative features include the self-indulgence and at times pretentiousness with which he devises his arguments, scatters his insights, "telescopes" his chronology (to invoke another implication of this symbol) and drops his names (Bachelard, Borges, Chomsky, Derrida, Jung, Levi- Strauss, Sapir, Ullmann, Vernant, etc.-though not, wondrous to notice, Thomas Kuhn). Moreover, while Reiss admits that there may be several "classes of discourse" operating at once, his own ar- gument seems nevertheless to depend on the reduction of modern discourse to a sort of vulgar scientism in order to contrast it with an equally vulgar, pre-Galilean animism-and so to prepare the ground for his convictions about the present "crisis" of discourse and hopes for a new and higher "great instauration," which will presumably in- volve the Great Book not of Nature but of Ecriture. In general Reiss sometimes displays a tendency to forget that, if the text is a world, it is not the world.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 281 In the end, however, the strengths of the book seem to me to out- weigh the weaknesses. If Reiss brings his own kind of "patterning" mystifications to intellectual history, he also brings refreshing in- sights and ingenious connections to the history of "writing," show- ing congruencies between prose styles and experimental method and the mentality of an emergent market economy. If Reiss seems to be caught in a paradox of his own devising, which is the impossibility of translation or even communication between the old and the new, he has made an impressive effort to resolve this hermeneutical puzzle by a mixture of literary methods intended to transcend the analytico- referential mode which most modern readers take for granted (though it remains questionable how successful he has been, given the willful insistence if not always logical clarity of his arguments). He has extensively and imaginatively illuminated one of the funda- mental shifts in European mentality, and his book is a major contri- bution to the history of Renaissance (and post- or "counter"- Renaissance) thought. It may be appropriate to and with a caveat lector, however: readers ought to be as selective and critical (and also as sympathetic) in their appraisal of Reiss's discourse as he has been in his survey of literary texts. With this in mind the modern reader, per- haps even the modernist reader, should derive much profit from this rich, learned, insightful and provocative post-modernist interpreta- tion.
