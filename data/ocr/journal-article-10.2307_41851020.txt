<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature, Culture, and the Environment: A Cross-Disciplinary Conversation Sabine Wilke University of Washington, Seattle As Vice President of PAMLA, the Pacific Ancient and Modern Language Association, I had the task of organizing the Forum at the 2010 annual convention hosted by Chaminade University in Honolulu, Hawai'i. The Forum follows the business meeting at the conclusion of the first full day of sessions and it is the one academic event that is attended by most conference participants regardless of specialization. Given its prominent place in the program, the venue invites debate on issues and broader topics relevant to all members of the association. For the 2010 Forum, I proposed a discussion of the role of literary and cultural studies in the environmental humanities because I believe that analyzing, understanding, and finding solutions to environmental problems is one of the most important tasks facing our generation and that the study of literature and culture has a significant contribution to make in this endeavor, a contribution that has not yet been sufficiently acknowledged. All conversations about the environment- including and especially scientific and policy-related debates- reflect values as well as cultural and historical beliefs. I refer to "environmental humanities" as an umbrella term that encompasses not only the (more narrowly defined) ecocritical study of literatures and cultures but also history, philosophy, and the humanistic social sciences as they relate to the study of the environment. For this special issue of Pacific Coast Philology , a number of scholars from the diverse fields represented in our organization contribute essays that engage environmental issues in readings of literary texts and cultural artifacts and, as a consequence, position these interpretations in a broader network of cross-disciplinary conversations. The application of ecocritical models of interpretation to literary scholarship outside the field of English, where ecocriticism began in the nineteen-nineties and where it has flourished as a widely accepted sub-field for over a decade, plays a key role in a broader conception of the study of literature, culture, and the environment. This special issue represents the first systematic attempt at bringing together ecocritical approaches to English-language as well as non- English language (German, French, Spanish, East Asian, and Classical) material. It is also the first attempt to showcase humanistic scholarship on environmental issues from such a broad range of fields and international backgrounds. In addition to the varied specializations in different national and linguistic traditions, the contributing authors display the vast range of topics and 115</page><page sequence="2">116 Sabine Wilke concerns that empower scholarship in the environmental humanities. From the study of geographical, therapeutic, and pollution narratives, to the relationship between the human and the non-human world, to the significance of global networks, the collection brings together an array of issues, both historical and contemporary. One of the most exciting cross-fertilizations in twenty-first-century literary and cultural studies is an emerging environmental perspective in postcolonial studies and in research on globalization and transnationalism (and, vice versa, a postcolonial perspective on environmental issues). Bonnie Roos and Alex Hunt have documented the converging interest in postcolonial and environmental studies in their recent collection of essays, Postcolonial Green: Environmental Politics and World Narratives , in which they show that the term " justice" "provides a space for theoretical bridging and merging ecocriticism and postcolonialism" (3). Within ecocritical scholarship the growing emphasis on environmental justice prepared the field for this kind of theoretical bridging. A "new green critique of colonial and postcolonial texts establishes a philosophically ethical or pragmatic environmental politics that is attuned to global concerns of justice" (6). Elizabeth DeLoughrey and George B. Handley recently presented the essay collection Postcolonial Ecologies: Literatures of the Environment that includes perspectives beyond English and American Studies that have traditionally been the focus of English-language ecocriticism. The contributors share research on Haiti, the Caribbean, Sri Lanka, the Pacific, India, South Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In turn the papers included in this special issue of Pacific Coast Philology position the study of literature and culture in a critical and institutional framework that draws on perspectives from the environmental humanities at large to include questions of environmental philosophy, aesthetics, rhetorical analysis, poetics, narratology, and research from the natural and social sciences. This engaging approach to important problems aims at a more nuanced understanding of the environment we inhabit. At the University of Washington, we are changing how we think about the environmental humanities. When the College of the Environment was established a few years ago, the humanities played a somewhat marginal role with the occasional elective course on literature and the environment cross- listed in the college's course offerings. As the university looks to developing a cross-divisional curricular structure, the humanities have created more articulated ways of offering a series of courses that address environmental issues. Driving this effort is the conviction that students in environmental programs profit from courses where literary and cultural aspects of the environment are discussed. Our colleagues in environmental studies at the University of Vermont have known for many years that "everyone [who cares</page><page sequence="3">Literature, Culture, and the Environment 117 about the environment] has a story to tell, one that is filled with values, experience, reflection, and meaning" (Kaza 4). At the University of Vermont, courses in the environmental humanities are an integrated part of the Environmental Program where students consider ethical assumptions, cultural perspectives, and expressive approaches to environmental subjects. In these courses, students "draw on the methods and skills of the humanities disciplines to raise questions often overlooked by scientific and economic approaches on problem-solving" (Kaza 4). While such an integrated curricular structure reflects institutional thinking at an advanced level, literary and cultural studies are still absent from a model that otherwise includes the study of religion and ecology, ecofeminism, environmental ethics, environmental history. Courses on environmental writing and art might be accompanied by courses on Irish poetry, American colonial history, German nature philosophy, Francophone and Latino studies, classical geography, and East Asian literature, all fields represented in this volume. The papers collected in this special issue probe the connection between literature, culture, and the environment. How do we narrate and depict environments? How do we talk about nature scenes and what images do we use to illustrate them? How did the generations before us address these questions and how do various cultures deal with these problems? Unless we have a refined understanding of the rhetorical, poetic, and aesthetic paradigms that inform the representation of nature scenes, we limit ourselves to a hazy conception of environmental issues. The colleagues in Vermont make convincing arguments about the inclusion of historical perspectives in environmental studies by pointing to the fact that by "taking a historical perspective, we can understand environmental problems as an accumulation of decisions, narratives, and trends that, even if disturbing, make sense historically" (Kaza 4). They also give reasons for the value of literary analysis and suggest that "by looking at the narrative structure, we can see how cultural perspectives are reproduced in relation to the environment, revealing the bias of the storyteller" (Kaza 4). The inclusion of environmental philosophy and ethics, art, music, dance, and theater, they say, points to the recognition that "human values tend to drive political and economic decisions and thus need to be addressed as part of environmental interdisciplinary thinking" (Kaza 5). So do international perspectives. The environmental leaders of tomorrow need to speak multiple languages and be conversant in other cultural milieus in order to find global solutions to global problems. The disciplines represented in this volume teach linguistic competence, historical awareness, and cultural sensitivity. They bring to the table an advanced understanding of narratological, poetic, rhetorical, discursive, and aesthetic structures that inform the discussion of environmental issues. At Bucknell</page><page sequence="4">118 Sabine Wilke University, for example, a course on Norse Sagas is part of their environmental humanities offerings. The Environmental Humanities Graduate Program at the University of Utah lists an emphasis on interdisciplinary and international concerns as one of the features that enhances placement of its graduates. Their program is designed to prepare scholars in an expanding field with an increasing international outlook where they will need to be knowledgeable about natural and cultural diversity, the significance of place, the experience of diasporas, endangered languages, and the connection of all these issues to the state of the environment. How can we sharpen the role of literary and cultural studies in the environmental humanities? In her afterword to the aforementioned essay collection, Postcolonial Green, Ursula Heise reminds us that we need to investigate how questions of literary form relate to environmental and social justice and study the textual tropes that establish links between the natural world and the human observer (see Roos and Hunt 256). How are these connections between ecological and social conditions troped in literary texts? How do aesthetic forms relate to cultural and biological structures? In Sean Ireton's contribution to this volume, "Nature as Therapy: Case Studies from Austria (Adalbert Stifter) and North America (Doug Peacock)," he reflects on the therapeutic value of nature for physical and mental health. His two case studies provide testimony on successful strategies of ecotherapy, which lead to a more holistic lifestyle and the embrace of a participatory relationship with nature. Ecotherapy emerges as critical intervention into the unhealthy dualisms of modern society and provides a framework for finding a non-dominating relationship with nature. Ireton teaches German at the University of Missouri where he offers courses on the German intellectual tradition and literature, ecophilosophy, and the environment. He is writing a book on the evolution of German and American attitudes towards nature in the realms of philosophy, literature, and politics on the example of Hölderlin, Schelling, Stifter, Thoreau, John Muir, Heidegger, and Aldo Leopold. Catherine M. Connors teaches classical languages and literatures at the University of Washington. Her areas of research and teaching interests are Roman literature and culture, ancient representations of nature and geography, and the ancient Greek and Roman novel and its reception. She is one of the few scholars in her discipline to engage ecocritical models of interpretation in the analysis of the classical tradition. In her essay on "Eratosthenes, Strabo, and the Geographer's Gaze," she analyzes narrative and ideological dimensions of geographical information that presents itself as otherwise objective and unbiased. Through the example of Eratosthenes' s and Strabo' s accounts of the places they travel to, she shows to what extent geographical accounts are written from a vantage point of power. Her</page><page sequence="5">Literature, Culture, and the Environment 119 philological analysis points to the distinctive vocabulary these classical authors use to perform geography. Connor's essay positions the ecocritical study of space and place in a humanistic context. Christoph Irmscher is a professor of American Studies at Indiana University where he teaches and writes about nineteenth-century American and Canadian literature and culture. His long-standing interest in ecocriticism, specifically early American nature writing, has guided several projects in recent years: his book on The Poetics of Natural History (1999), his edition of the writings of John James Audubon (1999), and the ecocritical anthology, A Keener Perception, which he co-edited with Alan Braddock (2009). In the paper for this volume, Irmscher focuses on "Catesby's Owl" and the problems associated with representing nonhuman nature from a perspective that avoids anthropomorphism. In his Natural History of Carolina, Fionda &amp; the Bahama Islands, the eighteenth-century British illustrator and natural historian, Mark Catesby, captures the fauna and flora of the British colony in fantastical portraits. He reflects on the fact that this world does not exist for the benefit of the human observer: whatever arrangements we think nature has made, putting animals, plants, and people where they belong, are temporary. Richard Watts' s essay on animal narratives in the French Caribbean is entitled "Poisoned Animal, Polluted Form: Chamoiseau's Birds at the Limits of Allegory." Watts' s research and teaching interests in the Division of French &amp; Italian at the University of Washington focus on the postcolonial francophone world. He is the author of Packaging Post/Coloniality: The Manufacture of Literary Identity in the Francophone World (2005). Written at the intersection of postcolonial studies and ecocriticism, his current project, tentatively entitled Water Narratives: Imagining Global Environmental Change in the Francophone Post/colonial World, examines how the pollution, privatization, and manufactured scarcity of water are rapidly altering its previously stable symbolic value in literature, cinema, and other forms of cultural production. In his contribution to this volume he deals with the recent work of Martinique writer Patrick Chamoiseau, his abandonment of the realm of human concerns, and his turn to narrating an animal encounter from the perspective of the natural world on the edge of an ecological calamity. This perspective urges us to go beyond reading animals allegorically as screens for human interests. The animals in Chamoiseau's novel do not necessarily stand for human concerns. They are vehicles for exploring and imagining responses to environmental degradation that come from a different, nonhuman world. Jorge T. Marcone is a professor of Spanish at Rutgers where he teaches courses on the environmental imagination in Latin American literature, Amazonia, and ecological ideas in the Spanish Americas. He was "Class of</page><page sequence="6">120 Sabine Wilke 1946 Professor of Environment and the Humanities" at Williams College in 2004-05. He has written on Mexican and Chicana/ o environmental writing, the politics of sustainable development in Amazonia, and primitivism in environmentalism, among many other subjects. His article on "A Painful Pastoral: Migration and Ecology in Chicana/ o Literature" considers the recurrence of the pastoral in the context of postmodern Chicana/ o writing by Gloria Anzaldúa, Cherríe Moraga, and Jimmy Santiago Baca. His essay positions ecological thinking within the context of Latin American cultural and environmental studies and reflects on Chicana queer ecology, migration between the countryside and the city, and the idea of post-traditional nature. As opposed to the meaning of the pastoral in Anglo-American writing, the pastoral of the rural Hispanic migrant is not a nostalgic reaction to modern alienation but a strategy for constructing a historical and place-based community with the ideal of global citizenship that seeks alliances with others. Karen Thornber teaches comparative literature at Harvard. Her main research and teaching areas are world literature and the literatures and cultures of East Asia. Her most recent publication, Ecoambiguities : Environmental Crises and East Asian Literatures (Michigan 2011), analyzes how literature from East Asia and around the world depicts the ambiguous relationships between people and their biophysical environments. In her contribution to this volume, "Acquiescing to Environmental Degradation: Literary Dynamics of Resignation," Thornber analyzes three East Asian pollution narratives from different cultural backgrounds and highlights the role creative writing can play in sharpening our insights into environmental degradation. Ultimately, she makes a case for a humanistic intervention in ecogradation. Allison Carruth teaches English at the University of Oregon where she is also a core faculty member of the Environmental Studies Program. She is currently Associate Director of the Program in Science, Technology and Society at Stanford. In her research she focuses on literature and media, environmental criticism, food studies, and globalization theory in the context of American culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Her forthcoming book is entitled Global Appetites: Imagining the Power of Food. In her next project she will focus on bioart and avant-garde movements that bridge the divisions between art and science and between environmentalism and technology. In her paper for this collection, "On Bog Lands and Digital Markets: Seamus Heaney's Recent Poetry," Carruth examines the work of Irish poet Seamus Heaney in terms of his poetic engagement with global networks of capital, media, and information. She shows how his poems give voice to communities that are both central and peripheral to the twenty-first century economy.</page><page sequence="7">Literature , Culture , and the Environment 121 I would like to thank the contributors for their engaging readings. The editors of PCP , Roswitha Burwick and Friederike von Schwerin-High, who suggested this project, have been a great resource in planning and editing this volume. I also thank the colleagues who suggested possible contributors for this special issue (Lawrence Buell, Ursula Heise, Elizabeth DeLoughrey) as such an interdisciplinary project can only be accomplished with the help of scholars from other fields. Japhet Johnstone copy-edited the manuscript to the volume's great benefit. I thank him for his meticulous editing and for his even keel and good humor. My colleagues at the University of Washington, Gary Handwerk and Richard Watts, have contributed to the shape of this project in more ways than they realize. Finally, the students in my undergraduate class on Literature, Culture, and the Environment have opened my eyes to issues and concerns that I had not fully grasped by approaching the topic solely from a scholarly vantage point. It is my hope that this collection of essays that positions ecocritical literary and cultural studies within the larger context of the environmental humanities will contribute to future conversations about the role of humanistic research in environmental studies and foster ongoing cross-disciplinary conversations.
