ZBENOVICH Israel Antiquities Authority P.O.B. 586 Jerusalem 91004 ABSTRACT The present paper reviews the data on the famous Chalcolithic cemetery Varnal in available and current literature, and provides some information on the Chalcolithic of Bulgaria as a whole. The author focuses on the gold Varna treasures, taking note of the similarity in weight and size to the latters of the gold Chalcolithic adornments from the Nahal Kana cave in Samaria Hills. The sophisticated technology of copper production, intrinsic to the Bulgarian Chalcolithic may be compared with the achievements of the ancient metallurgists of the Southern Levant, which are reflected mainly in the Nahal Mishmar hoard. Thus, the North of Balkan Peninsula as with the Southern Levant is considered to be the largest metallurgical center of the Chalcolithic in the whole Eurasian region. INTRODUCTION Even the small part of the Varna Cemetery treasure from Bulgaria exhibited in the Israel Museum in the summer of 1994 gives a clear enough idea of the tremendous scientific value of this archaeological site, which has not yet been fully studied. The exibition was also of great interest to Israeli archaeologists, because the represented material allowed to reveal some common features of the Southeastern Europe and Southern Levant ancient cultures. The Varna Cemetery is a major discovery European archaeology has had to its credit in the past 20 years. It ranks among such sites as the copper mines of Ai-Bunar in Bulgaria (Chemykh 1978) and Rudna Glava in Serbia 159</page><page sequence="2">160 ZBENOVICH (Jovanovic 1980), and the giant settlements of the Tripolye culture in the Ukraine.. (Kruts 1989; Shmaglii and Videik01993). All these remarkable archaeological sites date to the Chalcolithic (Eneolithic), a period of outstanding achievements in all fields of the economy, culture and social organization of the population of prehistoric Europe. In the first place, this period saw the victory of farming and animal husbandry - productive forms of the economy - over hunting and gathering. The technology of stone tool manufacture improved, the range and quantity of the tools expanded. The manufacture and use of copper tools in every-day life stimulated a steady search for improvements in techniques and technologies. The appearance of perfected firing kilns and the potter's wheel led to the production and extensive spread of high-quality pottery with a beautiful painted ornamentation. In the Chalcolithic, Man's horizon greatly widened and his knowledge of Nature deepened. The religious beliefs of prehistoric farmers and the symbolism and rituals associated with them became more complex. The need for copper tools and adornments, and exchanges in these items were an impetus to multilateral contacts resulting in the fast spread of innovations facilitated by the development of wheeled vehicles. SOME NOTES ON THE CHALCOLITHIC OF BULGARIA The highest achievements of this period can be seen in the northern regions of the Balkan Peninsula, primarily in the territory of the present-day Bulgaria. As far back as the Neolithic, the proximity of Anatolia and the Aegean facilitated migrations to the Balkans from the south and the dissemination of the achievements of the highly developed prehistoric farming cultures of the Near East. Favorable natural conditions (fertile soil, abundance of water and mineral resources) were the prerequisites for successful farming, processing of stone and other raw materials, and the manufacture of ceramics. The Neolithic-Chalcolithic transition in this region can be dated to the beginning of the 6th millennium B.P., when the first small copper tools and adornments - rather scarce at the time ־ appeared in Bulgarian settlements, with the ore coming from the North Thracian mines in Bulgar ia's south. According to uncalibrated radiocarbon dates (Boyadjievl988; Quitta and Kohl 1969), the Chalcolithic in Bulgaria lasted throughout 6000-5400 B.P.</page><page sequence="3">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 161 Figure 1: The main archaeological sites with the oldest gold objects (map). 1 - Tiszasölös; 2 - Velk6 Raskovce; 3 - Tibava; 4 - Hotnica; 5 - Devnja-Reka; 6 - Devnja; 7 - Varna II; 8 - Varna I; 9 - Durankulak; 10 - Krivoi Rog; 11 - Nikolskoye; 12 - Ikiztepe; 13 - Nahal Kana.</page><page sequence="4">162 ZBENOVICH The materials obtained from the multilayered tell settlements in Bulgaria show that the local population was making steady progress at the early phases of the Chalcolithic. However, the heyday of the local farming cultures, their Golden Age, did not come until the late Chalcolithic (end of the first - beginning of the second half of the 6th millennium B.P.)• At that time, Central and Southern Bulgaria (and also Southeastern Romania) were occupied by the Karanovo VI - Kodjadermen - Gumelnita cultural entity, Western Bulgaria - by the people of the Krivodol-Salcuta culture, and Northeastern Bulgaria - by the Varna culture people (Todorova 1986). They were farmers who grew several species of wheat, naked and hulled barley, millet, legumes, and used primitive wooden and antler ploughs with cattle as draught animals. Their clay-house settlements had a clear-cut layout and were often surrounded by fortifications - ramparts and ditches. The great amount of tools and implements found in the settlements shows that the occupants were engaged in quarrying and processing of flint and stone, leather treatment, bone- and woodworking, weaving, and wickerwork making. Researchers point out a certain degree of standardization and differentiation of the tools and the appearance of specialized devices and equipment as indicating a high level of development of many crafts and the existence of professional craftsmen (Skakun 1993). This also applies to the manufacture of high-quality pottery ornamented with painted and incised designs and fired in special kilns at 800-1000oC (Evans 1973; Todorova 1986). The most impressive, however, are the achievements of the late Chalcolithic metallurgy. By that time copper extraction at the North Thracian mines, operating since the early Chalcolithic, had greatly expanded. Eleven narrow open mines with a total length of 500 m have been discovered in the Ai-Bunar locality. Chalcolithic miners extracted from them a tremendous amount of ore which at that time was used to make most of the copper items found on the territory of Bulgaria (Chernykh 1978). However, no traces of metallurgy have been found either in Ai-Bunar or contemporaneous settlements. Noting this circumstance, Chernykh, who investigated the Ai-Bunar mines, believes that the metal was smelted and the tools were fashioned at special places, reflecting thus, specialization of the miners and metalworkers(Chernykh 1978). After making an expert metallographic assessment of the late Chalcolithic copper items from Bulgaria, Ryndina (1993) has come to the conclusion that</page><page sequence="5">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 163 the prehistoric craftsmen had rich experience and know-how. They were skilled forgers and used moulds of nine types, including those with a rod to shape the shaft-hole. Their most commonly used technology was forging in various temperature modes, annealing, welding and secondary hammering of the cast tool or blank to final shape and then hardening it. Ryndina believes that five groups of professional craftsmen took part in the extraction and processing of copper, namely, miners, metalworkers, smiths, foundry men, and mould makers. As of today, over 1,000 late Chalcolithic metal items have been registered in Bulgaria. Most of them are made of pure copper. They are primarily heavy tools (chisel-axes, shaft-hole hammer-axes, chisels, gouges), smaller instruments (awls), and adornments (pins, rings, various bracelets). They have been found at settlements as well as in the graves as funeral gifts (Chernykh 1978; Ryndina 1993; Todorova 1986). Fully manufactured items and copper ingots coming from several metal processing centers found their way - via traditional trade routes - eastward, to the territory of what is today Moldova, Ukraine and even the Volga area, regions without copper resources of their own. The Northern Balkan region is second to none for the quantity and assortment of copper items produced in the Chalcolithic and for the equipment used by local craftsmen of that period. The initial impulse to the development of metallurgy might have come from Anatolia, where people started using metal two thousand years earlier (Catal Höyük, £ayönö Tepesi, Asikli Höyük), yet the subsequent magnificent progress in this field was equally the cause and the result of a faster growth of the local Chalcolithic cultures. The spiritual life of the people and their religious beliefs connected with farming cults (mainly with the worship of the Mother Goddess) are reflected in the numerous and various female figurines, sometimes seeming to play some role in ritual scenes (Todorova 1979), in zoomorphic plastic, and in clay models of dwellings and altars. Some researchers suggest that large cult centers with special places of worship might have existed. The early farmers had a rudimentary knowledge of astronomy and some idea of what a calendar should be. The system of signs-pictograms on ceramic plates and vessels warrants a cautious assumption that the Bulgarian Chalcolithic saw the birth of prewriting.</page><page sequence="6">164 ZBENOVICH VARNA CULTURE AND THE VARNA I CEMETERY It can be safely said that the Varna culture people who lived on a narrow strip of the Black Sea western coast south of the mouth of the Danube were far ahead of their neighbors (Todorova 1979, 1986). The geographic location of this region facilitated contacts with the vast Cucuteni-Tripolye culture in the Northwestern Pontic region and the steppe herder tribes. They must have also had ties extending southward, to the Aegean and the Mediterranean. Local traditions and innovations acquired through external influences had combined to build the specific traits of the Varna culture reflected in house building, burial rites, ceramics (graceful graphite-coated vessels). Metalworkers of this region, lying some 300 km from the Ai-Bunar mines, launched a mass production of copper items (Ryndina 1993; Todorova 1986). Position of the Pontic region as an important production and trade center is also confirmed by the high density of the population, especially in the vicinity of the Varna Lake (Ivanov 1988; Todorova 1986). In the Chalcolithic it was a Black Sea bay, and the littoral settlements were flooded by subsequent sea level rise; but the cemeteries, such as Devnja, Devnja-Reka and others are known. The presence of some gold items among the grave goods have already served as an indication of the distinctive character of the local Chalcolithic culture. But the real "information explosion" was caused by the discovery of the Varna I cemetery in 1972. It was found quite by chance, during some routine earth-moving in the city of Varna, on a gently sloping terrace of the lake's northern coast. Excavations directed by I. Ivanov started in 1972 (Ivanov 1978a, 1988) and at present some 7,500 m2 (three-quarters of the cemetery's territory) have been examined. Three hundred graves were revealed1, but there are no signs of any clear-cut layout. Most of the graves (225) contained human remains in rectangular 2x1 m pits, but 70 of them have been damaged by construction work and earth moving on the cemetery's territory. In the remaining 155 graves people were buried extended on the back (90) or contracted (65), mostly on the right side. Almost all the dead had NE orientation. Grave 43 is unique. It is a big (2.7 x 1.05 m) and deep (2.2 m) pit with the remains of a tall man of 40 to 50 who was buried on his back. His headdress and long attire now reduced to dust were ornamented with numerous beads made of gold and various minerals, gold pendants and rings. There were</page><page sequence="7">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 165 gold-bead necklaces on his chest, two heavy gold bracelets on his arms above the elbows (and another bracelet made of the Spondylus shell with applied gold plates on his left arm). On his wrists he had heavy gold-bead bracelets. A small stone axe with the haft carrying gold tubes was put in his right hand. A copper spear-head was found lying close to his left shoulder, with the shaft also ornamented with gold tubes. All in all, 990 gold items totalling 1.516 grams were retrieved from the burial (890 beads, 42 convex appliques, 16 bracelets, a hollow cone-like object, etc.) The grave contained a rich set of labor implements - two hammer-axes, a gouge, chisel, needle, awl; two flint blades (one of them 40 cm long) and a javelin-head, two stone gouges, two bone needles. There were also five clay vessels standing close to the deceased. The funeral gifts in the other inhumation graves were much more modest - in most cases from one to ten items including labor implements, ceramics, adornments. All of them have yielded more than 250 small gold items. Twenty-three graves had no funeral goods. Another group of graves (56, that is, 20$&gt; of the total) are symbolic graves (cenotaphs) with no people buried. Located mostly in the southern part of the necropolis, they differ from the regular graves by the rich grave goods they contained, with gold objects found in 34 of them. These were often arranged in an "anatomical order", the way a person would wear them, symbolizing as it were the presence of a body. Three graves stand out for the riches found in them. From grave 1 216 gold items totalling 1,092 grams have been retrieved: two hollow gold bracelets and three gold-rod bracelets; six gold-wire earrings; 27 convex appliques; flat rectangular, trapezoidal and crescent shaped plates; numerous cylindrical beads, two cylindrical tips, a spiral band, etc. There were also six copper implements; six flint blades including a unique, 44-cm-long blade; 516 beads made of various minerals, 1.640 Dentalium shells and a flat bone "idol." Grave 4 contained 339 gold items (1.518 grams): 242 beads (cylindrical, biconical, spheric), 19 spiral narrow bands, seven various bracelets, 13 convex round pendants, flat rectangular plates, seven wire rings, seven thin band short cylinders, etc. Of special interest among the six copper items is a 1 The figures cited below are based on the 1986 data, when 281 Varna graves were known (Ivanov 1988).</page><page sequence="8">166 ZBENOVICH unique pick-axe with a long rod "beak". There were also five flint blades, a stone wedge-chisel, a stone hammer-axe with five gold tubes in its wooden haft. The adornments were represented by 53 red rock crystal beads and 30 kaolin beads. Worthy of note are also 1.400 Dentalium shells, an antler hook and a bone anthropomorphic "idol". Two out of the four ceramic vessels (a large dish and vase with a lid) were decorated with a gold-paint design. In grave 36, as many as 857 gold items (789 grams) have been found: 752 beads of various shapes; two hollow double bracelets; 33 convex appliques; 30 application plates shaped like a horned animal head; two flat bull-shaped plates; seven anthropomorphic pendants, a miniature diadem, and a sickle shaped object fashioned from a gold band; a small replica of an animal vertebra (astragal), 15 gold-wire rings, etc. There was a unique small hammer with a profiled butt and gold tubes mounted into the haft. The only copper items were a hammer-axe and a needle. There were also three flint blades, 30 kaolin beads, 2.100 Dentalium shells, a marble bowl, and several pottery sherds. Symbolic graves 2, 3 and 15 are of particular interest. They contained sculptured full-size clay human faces ("masks") at the bottom of the pit. The masks had round gold plates for the eyes, a thin gold strip for the mouth, and heads of small gold nails for the teeth. The ears were punctured to put gold-wire earrings on. On the forehead was a small gold-band diadem. A few smaller gold items - rings, plates, appliques, beads, small nails, pins - have been found in every grave. Besides the gold, a copper pin, a flint blade, a small stone spindle-whorl, a bone "idol", and four clay vessels have been found in grave 2, and in grave 3 - a necklace of small kaolin beads, a copper pin, a flint blade, a marble "idol" with five round appliques, a marble dish, and three clay vessels. The excavations of the cemetery have yielded a rich collection of items of material culture, some of them made specially as grave goods. This applies primarily to the pottery found in 809£&gt; of the graves (600 vessels altogether, two or three vessels in each grave on average). Vessels of usual shapes (profiled pots with lid, vases, dishes, hollow support vessels, etc.) ornamented with graphite, red paint and an incised design were clearly made with deliberate carelessness and inadequately fired as distinct from the pottery found in settlements. However, the big dish and vase with lid (grave 4) painted gold on the bright graphite-treated surface are real masterpieces of the pottery-making art.</page><page sequence="9">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 167 Some 160 copper items (found in 82 graves) include hammer-axes, gouges, chisels, awls, needles, bracelets, rings, pins, etc. The lithics are mainly knife-like blades, scrapers, sickles, spear and javelin heads (about 230 objects altogether). Edge-axes (more than 50), hammers, chisels are made of hard stone; marble is represented by several bowls and small conical vessels as well as an anthropomorphic "idol". Bone and antler seem to have been the prime materials for hooks, plates, needles, pins and "idols". The various beads show that almost all the available materials (malachite, rock crystal and quartz, kaolin, marble, shells) were used. Bracelets made of the Spondylus shells brought from the south have also been found. The Varna cemetery's hallmark is its gold, which is the site's "visiting card" and its enigma. More than 3.000 gold items totalling of 6 odd kg have been found there. Most of the finds (6096) come from the 34 symbolic graves. All in all, gold has been found in 61 graves. According to Ivanov's classification (1988), there are 30 types of Varna's gold items, with some types represented by several variants. The number of beads (cylindrical, biconical, spheric, etc.) comes to 80^׳ of all the gold items. In some necklaces gold beads are combined with beads made of other materials. There are many various plates (670 of the total) - flat, convex, with holes to sew them on clothes, with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs. The yield from the richer graves includes heavy hollow and double bracelets and bracelets made of thick rod of round cross-section. There are a lot of rings of various diameter and cross-section (with closing and overlapping ends); various plates, narrow-band spirals, small nails. Some items, such as the baton-hammer and the astragal (grave 36) are unique. The Varna gold items were doubtless made by local masters skilled in forging, smoothing and polishing the surface, poin?on ornamentation, and punching. The gold they used was of a high fineness standard and must have been coming from different sources. Hartmann (1978) singles out pure-gold items (or with a low platinum content) and a group of items with a higher platinum content. Scholars believe that the metal was being brought from the Mediterranean, the Balkans and other regions, but it is a question requiring further research.</page><page sequence="10">168 ZBENOVICH DISCUSSION The magnificence and distinctive character of the Varna gold are a puzzle to scientists. The International Archaeological Congress, which focussed on the results of the first years of excavations (City of Varna, 1976), has succeeded in posing a number of questions without giving exhaustive answers to any. The Varna phenomenon is yet to be explained. It is necessary to analyze the anthropological material, compare the burials regarding sex and age, establish the cemetery's stratigraphy and microchronology, study contemporaneous settlements in the Varna Lake region, and do some other research. As of today, the interpretations suggested are just preliminary working hypotheses. Some researchers (Todorova and others) seem to be right in assuming that during the late Chalcolithic the population of Bulgaria's Black Sea coast engaged in and controlled sea trade in copper, getting gold in return. The riches accumulated gradually - a suggestion supported by the gold found in one of the three burials of the Varna II cemetery dating to an earlier Chalcolithic phase than Varnal (Ivanov 1978b). It may be presumed that the Varna I cemetery was the burial grounds for several neighboring settlements in the Varna Lake region and one of them may have been the administrative and cult center of the microregion or even of the whole Varna culture area. The difference in grave goods and rituals may be attributed to the emerging social and possibly property stratification of the society. There is no doubt that a man of a very high social standing - a clan or tribal chief - was buried in grave 43 (Ivanov 1978a). In the other rich graves heads of extended families or clans must have been buried. The cenotaphs (graves 1,4,36 and others) appear to be special ritual graves intended for persons who by virtue of their social status could not be buried side by side with ordinary people. The cenotaphs may have signified the symbolic presence of priests, which can be hypothetized from such things as baton hammers (sceptres) and, especially, stylized bone "idols" absent in the other graves (Ivanov 1978a, 1988). Sacred functions were probably performed not only by men but by women too, as is seen by the grave goods found in "mask"-containing graves 2 and 3 (small copper and gold adornments and no labor implements save for the spindle-whorl used only by women), and by the double knobs for breasts on the masks.</page><page sequence="11">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 169 It is very likely that people of lower social status and even some full fledged members of the communities were buried with no or only a few goods. There are many graves of this kind in other cemeteries of the Varna culture (Devnja, Durankulak) and in the KaranovoVI-Gumelnita culture zone (Vinica, etc). But the presence of gold even in the Varna I ordinary graves shows that a considerable amount of it had been amassed in the local milieu. Renfrew (1978) consideres the chiefdom level of the Varna society stratification. This society, however, could not be defined as so much complex; in particular, the aristocracy and the military strata are hardly identified (the grave goods contain virtually no weapons). And though the "gold" Varna I Necropolis looks elitarian against the background of the Bulgarian Chalcolithic, the egalitarian nature of the latter is evident. Among the archaeological sites of the 6th millennium B.P. with the gold finds (Figure 1), Varna stands out for the quantity, variety and aesthetic value of its items. In Mesopotamia we know only a few small adornments of the Ubaid period from Tepe-Gawra and Ur (Mooreyl985) . Anatolia, with its gold deposits, has so far yielded only one anthropomorphic pendant (Ikiztepe) which may have been imported from the Varna area (Bilgi 1984)2. In pre-dynastic Egypt the earliest gold items (a few small beads and pieces of foil) have been found in graves of the Naqada II stage (Ciaowicz 1985). The earliest gold adornments of the Carpathian Chalcolithic - anthropomorphic pendants from the Tiszapolgär culture cemeteries of Tibava (Siska 1968) and Velke Raskovce (Vizdal 1977) in Slovakia (20 objects altogether) - look like a poor imitation of the Varna gold. Processing of gold must have begun here under the impact of the Varna culture area but local raw materials were used. Even at a later stage of the Chalcolithic (Bodrogkeresztur culture), when exquisite gold adornments, like those in the Tiszaszölös-Mojgrad treasure, appeared (Makkay 1989), the production of Varna-type anthropomorphic pendants and application plates continued in this region. Alongside Thracian copper, gold objects penetrated farther to the northeast owing to inter-tribal exchange. The gold-wire pendant from the late Neolithic Nikolskii cemetery (Telegin 1991) and the small gold tube from the early Chalcolithic Krivoi Rog cemetery (Rassamakin and Budnikov 1993) in the Dnieper region must have come from Varna. Chernykh (1991) has calculated 2 Bilgi refers this pendant to the finds of the Early Bronze period.</page><page sequence="12">170 ZBENOVICH that within the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical Province, which supplied metal to the entire Southeastern Europe in the 6th millennium B.P., there are 3.100-3.300 gold objects against the 4.000-4.500 known copper items, with 9190 of the gold found in the Varna cemetery. When noting the high standard of the Varna and other Chalcolithic cultures in Bulgaria, scholars especially stress the achievements in mining, metallurgy and metalworking. True enough, the Varna and Karanovo VI cultures are much superior to the Chalcolithic cultures of the Carpathian region (Tiszapolgär and others) and the Balkans (Vinca) as regards the quantity, volume and variety of the goods produced and the technology of metallurgical production. They are also far ahead of the contemporaneous cultures of the Near and Middle East. Avilova and Chernykh (1989) have established that only 60 items made of arsenical bronze (mostly small adornments) have been found at Copper Age sites in Anatolia. The Chalcolithic cultures of the Southern Levant, particularly the territory of Israel, appear to be best corresponding to the Bulgarian Copper Age in volume and level of metallurgical production. As of today, some 500 copper items have been found there (Shalev 1994), with three quarters of them coming from the famous Nahal Mishmar treasure (Bar-Adon 1980). According to the latest researches (Levy and Shalev 1989; Shalev and Northover 1987, 1993; Shalev et al. 1992), utilitarian items - flat axes, chisels and so on - made of native copper were cast in open moulds and then hammered and annealed. They were manufactured right in the settlements, as the Shiqmim habitation site shows, almost in every household (Levy and Shalev 1989). This level of production corresponds well with the individual family production of copper items established by Ryndina (1993) for the Karanovo VI culture in Bulgaria. Prestige/cultic objects (mace heads, standards, sceptres, "crowns", vessels, and so on) were cast in the "lost wax" technique together with a relief ornamentation, and a stone core might have been used when mace heads were cast (Shalev et al. 1992). All these objects are made of copper alloys with a high content of arsenic, antimony or nickel (Shalev 1994), that is, actually of bronze. The places of their production remain unknown. The skillful use of various alloys, sophisticated casting methods and isolation of production areas from habitation sites show that the prestige/ cultic objects were manufactured by a group of professional craftsmen, as was the case in the Bulgarian Karanovo VI and Varna cultures (Ryndina 1993).</page><page sequence="13">THE OLDEST GOLD IN THE WORLD 171 On the whole, the Southern Levant can be regarded as a major metallurgical center of the Chalcolithic period (Zbenovich 1994), and its southern regions (Nahal Beersheva - Nahal Besor valleys) with their numerous industrial remains must have played a role similar to the role of Varna culture in the metalworking of the Bulgarian Chalcolithic. In conclusion I would like to go back to precious metal objects, in particular to the eight heavy gold and electrum bracelets found in a Chalcolithic burial in the Nahal Kana cave (Gopher et al. 1990). The melt obtained at 1000" C was poured into open moulds and the surface of the ready items hammered. The weight of each bracelet varied from 80 to 165 grams, totally about 1 kg. Thus, the amount of the precious metal makes the Nahal Kana burial akin to the Varna cemetery. CONCLUDING REMARKS The archaeological sites of the second half of the 6th millennium B.P., to which the Varna cemetery belongs, mark not only the peak of the Bulgarian Chalcolithic but also its demise. The magnificent Chalcolithic cultures vanished abruptly, leaving just slight traces in the so-called transitional period. Scholars analyzing the possible causes of such dramatic changes presume that they came about because the internal potential for the development of the early farming cultures had been exhausted. They do not rule out adverse ecological factors such as aridization of the climate. But the hypothesis of the destructive invasion of war-like herding tribes seems to have more supporters than any other. The problem (common to all the Chalcolithic cultures of Southeastern Europe) is yet to be studied. It is, however, patently clear that the Early Bronze Age tribes inhabiting the Bulgarian territory in the 5th millennium B.P. were far behind their predecessors in every aspect, including the level of metallurgy. In volume of production, refinement and perfection, the Varna gold is second only to the famous treasures from the graves of Ur potentates and the remarkable Anatolian sites of the end of the Early Bronze period, such as Ala?a Höyük and Eskiyapar (Özgü§ and Temizer 1993). But it should be borne in mind that they were created almost a thousand years later and in an entirely different social milieu.</page><page sequence="14">172 ZBENOVICH REFERENCES CITED Avilova L.I. and Chernykh E.N. 1989.
