<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Reviews of Books 147 declares. This accounted for the frustration Bowles endured from  the time he fi rst became ambassador to India during the Truman  administration to his retirement from public service eighteen years  later (p. 242). Bowles’s two stints as ambassador to India (1951–1953 and  1963–1969) were public-relations triumphs. Dauer details how  Bowles endeared himself to his Indian hosts by behaving with gra- ciousness and informality. He refused to live in the ambassador’s  palace, moving his family into a four-bedroom house instead, and  enrolled his children in Indian public schools rather than the pri- vate institutions favored by previous ambassadors. While these were  important symbolic gestures, Dauer concludes that Bowles’s “im- pact on American relations with India” was “negligible” (p. 227).  Bowles was unable to persuade Washington to alleviate several In- dian food crises without tying political strings to the gift of Ameri- can wheat. He could not get the Johnson administration to pass  a military-aid program to assist India in the face of Pakistani ag- gression. Indeed, apart from an occasional cruel remark about  Bowles’s “goddamn halitosis,” Lyndon Johnson ignored the ambas- sador, and Bowles departed New Delhi convinced that America was  “a sick country, with the wrong priorities” (pp. 223, 174). Bowles himself was partly to blame for the failure to translate  his ideas into policy. Dauer notes that Bowles lacked “skill in bu- reaucratic infi ghting,” that he exasperated colleagues with ponder- ous speeches, and that he found it diffi cult to compromise (p. 102).  Nonetheless, Bowles’s views on the pressing geopolitical issues of  the day were more often right than wrong, and his prescriptions,  viewed from a post-Cold War perspective, hold up much better  than do those of the “amoral pragmatists” who dominated policy- making at mid-century. Boston College SETH JACOBS Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam.  By Gareth Porter. (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2005.  xviii   403 pp. $27.50 cloth, $15.95 paper) Every fi ve years or so, a major book heralding itself as the de- fi nitive explanation of the Vietnam War is published. Some live up  to their billing; others fall short. Gareth Porter’s very ambitious  new book, Perils of Dominance, is the latest such attempt. While it is  </page> <page sequence="2"> 148 Pacifi c Historical Review not for lack of effort, Porter ultimately fails in his quest to impose  radical revisions on the existing literature. Still, he should be ap- plauded for provoking debate on the subject with his intelligent,  imaginative, and interesting book. Perils of Dominance relies on two main arguments, neither of  which is as innovative as Porter claims. First, he contends that from  1953 to 1965 U.S. offi cials, and their communist counterparts in  Moscow and Beijing, knew that the United States possessed over- whelming strategic—that is, military, especially nuclear—superi- ority. Realizing their advantage, U.S. offi cials developed an “ex- tremely high level of confi dence . . . that the United States could  assert its power in Vietnam without the risk of either a major war  or a military confrontation with another major power.” Conscious  of their disadvantage, “the imbalance of power so constrained the  policies of Moscow and Beijing toward Vietnam . . . that it created  incentives for ambitious U.S. objectives in that country” (p. 259). In  short, the administrations of Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Ken- nedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson enjoyed such overwhelming domi- nance that they could do as they pleased in containing Vietnamese  communism. Second, Porter argues that all three Presidents were  the exceptions to the general rule of American overconfi dence  and aggressiveness and that they attempted, with a continuing lack  of success, to keep their key foreign policy advisers from launching  a war in Vietnam. While both of the book’s key arguments have merit, their ex- ecution is fundamentally fl awed and, as a result, they are mostly  unconvincing. Porter is very careful to illustrate just how superior  the United States was, but he is less successful in demonstrating  that superiority drove U.S. or communist policy. The book offers  nothing to overturn the now-standard view that Beijing promised  Hanoi it would intervene if the United States invaded North Viet- nam. Similarly, it offers nothing to overturn the long-held view that  the Johnson administration did not invade the North because of a  fear that the Chinese would indeed intervene, just as they had in  Korea a decade before. Tellingly, while Porter deftly uses interna- tional relations theory to critique the standard view of the domino  and bandwagon theories, he ignores two other dominant analo- gies from the 1960s, that of Munich and that of the “good doctor,”  both of which assumed U.S. vulnerability or weakness. Porter ar- gues persuasively that the United States was numerically superior,  but he is less convincing in arguing that American offi cials, espe- cially in the 1960s, were psychologically confi dent because of it. To  put it differently, his argument about the imbalance of power leads  </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews of Books 149 one to ask some basic questions: If U.S. dominance was so perva- sive, why did Johnson not expand the war to Laos and Cambodia?  Why not invade the North, probably America’s only war-winning  option? Why not bomb targets in southern China that were assist- ing the Vietnamese communists’ war effort? Beyond Vietnam, why  did Kennedy not invade Cuba when he had the chance in 1961 and  1962? Why did he accept a communist compromise over Berlin in  1961? Why not preemptively bomb the Chinese nuclear weapons  facilities at Lop Nor? Why embark on détente in 1963? And so forth.  Indeed, perhaps the imbalance of power that most infl uenced U.S.  policy toward Vietnam was that between the militarily and politi- cally superior Vietnamese communists and their vastly inferior  counterparts in Saigon. The book’s second main argument is even less convincing,  not intrinsically on its merits but simply because too often Porter  stretches his argument further than his evidence can support. One  problem is his constant anthropomorphic reference to a cohesive,  monolithic “national security bureaucracy,” such as the following:  “The national security bureaucracy was even more confi dent in  1962 than it had been in 1961” (p. 163). This literary device un- derlines Porter’s view that U.S. offi cials other than the Presidents  were all of one mind and, therefore (although he prudently denies  it in his introduction), that the war was a product of consensus. He  notes, for example, that the response to the 1961 Taylor-Rostow re- port was unanimously approving, save for John Kenneth Galbraith  and Kennedy himself. Yet Dean Rusk, of all people, was strongly  opposed to sending U.S. troops, and it was he who convinced Sec- retary of Defense Robert McNamara not to push for them. Simi- larly, although they were certainly not doves, both Rusk and Gen.  Maxwell Taylor strongly opposed sending U.S. troops through  1964 and into the spring of 1965, a fact Porter also elides. Porter  also seriously underestimates the extent to which McNamara had  begun to doubt the war as early as 1964. A second problem is Porter’s reliance on oral histories, per- sonal interviews, and memoirs for his main evidence. To take but  one example, he discusses Chester Bowles’s plan for the neutraliza- tion of Southeast Asia in 1962 as a viable alternative to war that  Kennedy supported. But the only person who ever took Bowles se- riously was Bowles; Kennedy certainly did not. Sure enough, when  one checks Porter’s footnotes, his source turns out to be Bowles’s  highly self-serving memoirs. Finally, a third problem relates to the sheer number of stan- dard interpretations Porter tries to overturn. In the end, his analy- </page> <page sequence="4"> 150 Pacifi c Historical Review sis comes across as cursory and superfi cial because it suffers from  the same imperial overstretch he detects among U.S. policymak- ers. To take two examples among many, he offers little to convince  readers that John Foster Dulles was against intervention in 1954 or  that both Kennedy and Johnson sought a negotiated way out of the  quagmire. Despite these limitations, Perils of Dominance will force every- one conceptually to re-evaluate, even if only to re-affi rm, their  views on the origins of the Vietnam War. Cambridge University ANDREW PRESTON Reagan’s Victory: The Presidential Election of 1980 and the Rise of the  Right. By Andrew E. Busch. (Lawrence, University Press of Kansas,  2005. x   237 pp. $35) This book is written by a political scientist who vastly ap- proves of the events he is reporting on and is here reviewed by a  historian of an opposite political persuasion. So, reader, be wary.  On the whole, however, it is pleasant to report that the book is a  sound, succinct, and informative piece of scholarship that any se- rious reader should fi nd useful. Especially so is the penultimate  chapter on state and congressional elections in 1980, which covers  issues that seem far less well known than the events surrounding  “the Gipper’s” road to the White House. The author’s central theme is that the American electorate  and the President himself suffered an overpowering “crisis of con- fi dence” during the Jimmy Carter years and that Reagan dissipated  this psychological malaise. He did it with an outlook of optimism  and a set of allegedly enlightened policies that placed the election  of 1980 on par with those of 1912 and 1932. “Altogether, only 1912,  1932, and 1980 offered a new public philosophy around the nexus  of institutions and policy,” Busch avers (p.189). So, move over Dem- ocrats Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, and give a Repub- lican giant his rightful place among the great American Presidents  of the twentieth century! The crux of Busch’s appraisal is that Reagan’s political philos- ophy and practices emphasized “freedom” versus the statist prin- ciples of modern “progressives” (pp. 52–53). Stated thus boldly,  his exposition might appear stale or trite, but he capably fl eshes  out his argument with terse yet thorough analyses of a great many  of Reagan’s policies. He also makes an effort to analyze the argu- </page> </plain_text>
