SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON ORGANIZATIONAL ECOLOGY: REBUTTAL TO YOUNG' In its July 1988 issue (94:1-24), AJS published a commentary on some of our studies: "Is Population Ecology a Useful Paradigm for the Study of Organizations?" We are grateful to AJS for focusing attention on our work.2 Unfortunately, the commentary draws a caricature of our contri- bution to organizational ecology and confuses numerous issues. Limita- tions of space preclude correcting all the misunderstandings and misat- tributions here. However, we do wish to correct the misleading view that the commentary is a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the population ecology of organizations, as its title, introduction, and conclu- sion suggest.

Indeed, it takes as its premise the incor- rect view that we have attempted to reduce organizational processes to biological ones, that we seek a mapping between the organizational and biotic worlds. A responsible assessment of the "usefulness" of a program of theory and research also requires consideration of the full breadth of the research it produces. But, in trying to make the best of a weak case that our work is narrow and has had little effect, the commentary ignores our recent em- pirical work and that of many other scholars who have refined and ex- tended our approach.3 In response, we discuss five lines of research that have clarified and advanced our understanding of the ecology of organi- zations. But first we turn to the goals of the approach. Motivations The ecology of organizations is an approach to the macrosociology of organizations that builds on general ecological and evolutionary models of change. The goal of this perspective is to understand the forces that shape organizational structures over long time spans. Our interest in developing an ecology of organizations began in the mid-1970s at a time when the sociology of organizations was shifting toward an emphasis on the effects of environments on the structure and functioning of organiza- tions. Most theorists and researchers in this period treated organizations as rational, flexible, and speedy adapters to changing environmental cir- cumstances and explained variability in structures in terms of adaptations to environmental constraint by individual organizations or prescient managers. We did not find this approach to be useful in explaining the structures we observed. The organizations we observed did not seem to have unitary, stable preference structures and simple mechanisms for imple- menting them in the face of changing conditions. In our experience, subunits and coalitions commonly engaged in political contests for control over decisions and resources. Such political processes, along with various kinds of sunk costs and legitimacy constraints, caused these organizations to be anything but flexible and quick in collective response to changing opportunities and constraints in the environment. Put simply, we thought it was a mistake to build models of organizational change that rely on anthropomorphic images of organizations or on heroic images of man- 3 The critique treats unfairly other scholars working in this tradition. Even supposing that a serious flaw had been identified in our work, it does not follow that research by other scholars who use a similar perspective must also be flawed. 426</page><page sequence="3">Commentary and Debate agers. Hence, we have attempted to build a perspective that treats or- ganizations as complex systems with strong limitations on flexibility and speed of response ("structural inertia"). Following the proclivity to think anthropomorphically about organiza- tions, the literature in this period also used what we have called a focal organization perspective. That is, theorists and researchers sought to describe and explain the action of single organizations facing specified environmental problems. But this perspective too seemed problematic. The success or failure of any tactic or strategy for dealing with an envi- ronmental problem presumably depends on the tactics and strategies adopted by the other similar (and dissimilar) organizations in the system. Therefore, we thought it would be productive to shift the level of analysis to the population level. This means considering actions of all organiza- tions of a type within a bounded system. We also concluded that the organizational theory of the 1970s was leading the field to an isolated position within sociology. Both the ten- dency to reason anthropomorphically about organizations and the focal organization perspective greatly limited the value of organizational the- ory for explaining large-scale social change. Indeed a major thrust of our work has been to build bridges with other branches of macrosociological theory and research. For example, we have developed implications of organizational ecology for processes of large-scale social change, social movements, and social inequality (Hannan and Freeman 1986; Hannan 1986a, 1988a, 1988d). In preparing to develop a different kind of theory of organizational change, we considered two kinds of analytic structures. The first was the theory of the firm in competitive markets. This collection of theories has the appropriate population focus. Its distinguishing characteristic is an emphasis on the consequences of simultaneous actions of all parties in a market. However, this approach relies on theories of action and of or- ganization that seemed to share many of the defects of contemporary organization theory. Firms were viewed as rational, unitary actors with broad behavioral repertoires. So following the example of formal models of the behavior of firms seemed to deal with only one of the two broad problems that concerned us. A second analytic structure, ecological models of population and com- munity structure and dynamics, seemed more promising. These theories sought to explain how selection processes shape adaptation at the popula- tion level to environmental variations. The individual actors, biotic crea- tures, are assumed to have relatively fixed repertoires of action. So the motor of change is selection-the excess of births over deaths of actors that possess certain fixed strategies. We proposed an approach to analyzing organizational change using 427</page><page sequence="4">American Journal of Sociology models drawn from population ecology (Hannan and Freeman 1977, 1984). In doing so, we called attention to the strength of inertial forces on core features of organizational structure. We did not argue that individ- ual organizations never change, only that previous theory had overem- phasized adaptive change as a process generating variability in organiza- tional characteristics of interest. Indeed, we specified inertia in terms of relative rates of change: "To claim that organizational structures are subject to strong inertial forces is not the same as claiming that organiza- tions never change. Rather, it means that organizations respond rela- tively slowly to the occurrence of threats and opportunities in their envi- ronments. Therefore structural inertia must be defined in relative and dynamic terms. It refers to comparisons of the typical rates of change.... In particular, structures of organizations have high inertia when the speed of reorganization is much lower than the rate at which environmen- tal conditions change" (Hannan and Freeman 1984, p. 151). Despite the contrary claims in the commentary, we did not seek to use biological theory to explain organizational change. Nor did we propose to develop metaphors between biotic populations and organizational popu- lations. Rather, we wanted to explain a variety of sociological phenomena that could not be explained satisfactorily with existing social science theo- ries. We relied on models from population biology because these models appeared to clarify the social processes of interest. As we explained ini- tially, in describing our use of a classic model developed by mathematical biologists Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra: "No known population (of animals, or of organizations) grows in exactly the manner specified by this mathematical model.... What the equations do is to model the growth path of populations that exist on finite resources in a closed system.... Neither the protozoa nor the bureaucracies behave exactly as the model stipulates. The model is an abstraction that will lead to insight whenever the stated conditions are approximated" (Hannan and Freeman 1977, p. 961). We have adapted ecological models to sociological uses and have changed them in the process.4 It should be clear that we use ecological models as points of departure for modeling and analyzing social pro- cesses. Consider our approach to studying the effects of intrapopulation competition on rates of founding and mortality in organizational popu- I Thus, we do not assume that organizational and ecological processes operate accord- ing to the same laws. Consider, e.g., the issue of age dependence in mortality rates. The commentary raises as a crucial problem the finding that mortality rates of organi- zations decline with age, as we discuss below, but mortality rates of most biotic populations rise after some age. Only theorists interested in mechanistic reductions of one science to another would find this difference troubling. Instead, we have devel- oped a sociological explanation for the distinctive pattern of age dependence in organi- zational mortality rates (Hannan and Freeman 1984). 428</page><page sequence="5">Commentary and Debate lations. Standard population-biology arguments, as exemplified by the Lotka-Volterra model of competitive interactions, assume that growth in numbers depresses birth rates and raises mortality rates and that these effects are approximately linear. However, we think that these competi- tive effects are partially offset by an opposing process of institutionaliza- tion, which is clearly irrelevant in biotic applications. Our model of com- petition and legitimation holds that the effect of density on the vital rates of organizational populations is nonmonotonic-not linear (Hannan 1986b; Hannan and Freeman 1988a). Our empirical studies highlight this difference, as we describe below. Because social systems are complex and because social processes are often highly unstable, the equilibrium assumptions usually employed by biologists and organizational analysts do not seem appropriate to analyz- ing change in the world of organizations. Our work focuses on dynamics, especially on the local dynamics of processes that shape rates of entry and exit in populations of organizations. In studying dynamics, we consider entire populations of organizations over the full histories of the popula- tions. This strategy of research departs radically from most research on organizations, which tends to focus on the largest and longest-lived or- ganizations and on cross sections or very short time series. We have departed from a long tradition in organizational analysis separating theory from empirical research. We have developed tight links between theory, models, and empirical research. A key component in this program is methodological. Because we distrust equilibrium assumptions in organizational research, as noted above, we have sought to use models and methods appropriate for analyzing processes of change. In particular, we have relied on the methods of event-history analysis as a framework within which parameters of dynamic models of ecological processes can be estimated.5 In moving toward an ecology of organizations, we were influenced by Amos Hawley's (1950, 1968) neoclassical theory of human ecology. This theory, built on the bioecology of the 1930s and 1940s, sought to explain patterns of adaptation of human communities to ecological settings. It relied on a principle of isomorphism: in equilibrium "units subjected to the same environmental conditions, or to environmental conditions as mediated by a given key unit, acquire a similar form of organization" I The commentary complains that we have not supplied the full details of our methods. This is not so. Tuma, Hannan, and Groeneveld (1979), Tuma and Hannan (1984), and Hannan and Tuma (1985) have presented full details on the approach and on its application to the analytic questions we address, and the empirical papers on organiza- tional ecology provide appropriate citations. Moreover, detailed descriptions of our research designs are available (Hannan 1980, 1988b; Hannan and Freeman 1989, chap. 7). 429</page><page sequence="6">American Journal of Sociology (Hawley 1968, p. 334). We thought that the organization theorists of the 1970s were searching for such a principle but lacked the rigorous logic of Hawley's theory. We also thought that Hawley's approach needed to be extended in two ways if it were to apply generally to organization- environment relations. First, isomorphism processes needed to be ex- plored dynamically because organizational populations are rarely ob- served in equilibrium. Second, the concept of isomorphism had to be generalized to apply to settings in which the environment is spatially and temporally heterogeneous and thus poses problems of inconsistent adap- tive demands. A major thrust of our theoretical work is to develop such extensions (see esp. Brittain and Freeman 1980; Freeman and Hannan 1983; Hannan and Freeman 1989). Our thinking was also influenced strongly by Arthur Stinchcombe's (1965) insightful suggestion that cohorts of organizations are "imprinted" with the social, cultural, and technical features that are common in the environment when the cohort is founded. Imprinted characteristics are highly resistant to change. So the current characteristics of populations of organizations reflect historical conditions at the time of founding rather than recent adaptations. We thought that Stinchcombe was right about the historical facts. And we have suggested that his reasoning was strongly consistent with a population-ecology theory of organizational change. Developing the implications of this argument led us to emphasize rates of founding and rates of mortality in organizational populations and to consider processes over long historical periods. Our ecological evolutionary approach directs attention primarily to organizational diversity. It seeks to answer the question, Why are there so many (or so few) kinds of organizations? An ecology of organizations seeks to understand how social conditions affect the rates at which new organizations and new organizational forms arise, the rates at which organizations change forms, and the rates at which organizations and forms die out. In addition to focusing on the effects of larger social, economic, and political systems on these rates, an ecology of organiza- tions also emphasizes the interactions that take place within and between organizational populations. An extended treatment of the theoretical ap- proach is now available (Hannan and Freeman 1989). The commentary makes much of the fact that the boundaries of organi- zational populations are sometimes fuzzy and seems to suggest that the problem lies with our theory rather than with social reality.6 All sociology 6 It also gives the misleading impression that issues of taxonomy are simple ones in biotic applications. Our reading of the relevant literature does not support this view. Issues of empirical classification of biotic forms are still hotly debated among biolo- gists. It does not seem to have been the case that taxonomic issues had to be solved before theoretical progress was possible. 430</page><page sequence="7">Commentary and Debate has difficulty in specifying boundaries of social systems. For instance, the subtle, shifting nature of the boundaries of social classes, occupations, social movements, interest groups, elites, and communities is well known. More to the point of the commentary, such problems are no more pressing in our work than in other kinds of organizational theory and research. In particular, issues of boundary specification are equally vex- ing whether the focus is on populations of organizations, organizational "sets," organizational "fields," or "societal sectors," to name some promi- nent candidates for a unit of analysis in the study of organization- environment relations (see Scott 1987, chap. 6). We have proposed two approaches to identifying and bounding organi- zational populations. The first uses information on the goals, strategies, and structures of individual organizations (Hannan and Freeman 1977, 1984). The second uses information on the social processes that create and erode social boundaries (including such processes as technical change, collective action, legitimation, and mobility of persons among organiza- tions) in order to identify bounded populations (Hannan and Freeman 1986). Researchers have used a variety of ways to implement these ideas empirically. We are still learning about the advantages and disadvan- tages of the alternatives. So, as is the case in virtually all sociology, the question of how to define boundaries around systems is partly open. However, the existence of open questions does not imply logical inco- herence. The critique concludes that little has been accomplished over the past 10 years and that the program of research ought to end. Not surprisingly, we reach a different conclusion. Our strategy has been to attempt to develop theories and methods in parallel so that we could set the stage for a broad effort to evaluate the empirical status of the theoretical program. If our approach to studying organizations was to prove useful, and be used, the theories had to be clear in their empirical implications and the methodology had to be well developed and accessible. The recent surge of population-ecology research using data on diverse kinds of organizational populations testifies that our theoretical approach has empirical import and that problems of definition and conceptualization are not insoluble. We turn next to a brief review of this work. Research Agendas The commentary claims that organizational ecologists have not succeeded in studying competition processes and that ecological research on organi- zations can consider only a narrow range of explanatory variables. These criticisms are far from the mark. Results of five lines of research, which 431</page><page sequence="8">American Journal of Sociology have developed along the lines proposed in our early statement of the approach (Hannan and Freeman 1977), speak clearly to these criticisms.7 The first line examines competition among interacting populations of organizations using variations on Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. Nielsen and Hannan (1977) and Carroll (1981) analyzed the expansion and con- traction of populations of educational organizations. Brittain and Wholey (1988) have analyzed interactions among subpopulations of semiconduc- tor manufacturers. McPherson (1983) has analyzed niche overlap and competition of voluntary associations using the equilibrium implications of the LV model, and McPherson and Smith-Lovin (1988) have replicated this study with data from five nations. A second thrust considers the ecological implications of aging of organi- zations. Although there had been speculation that organizations face a "liability of newness" (Stinchcombe 1965), only organizational ecologists addressed this issue using appropriate data and methods. Carroll and Delacroix (1982) found a liability of newness for newspapers in Argentina and Ireland during the 19th and 20th centuries, and Carroll (1983) found a similar pattern in analyzing data on 56 populations as diverse as retail stores, chemical manufacturers, and saloons. Freeman, Carroll, and Hannan (1983) explored whether this apparent effect of aging might be an artifact due to the effect of size on mortality (and an association of size with age). Analysis of populations of newspaper firms, semiconductor manufacturers, and labor unions reveals that adjusting for size does not diminish the effect of aging on mortality. Hannan and Tuma (1985) and Hannan (1988c) show that this conclusion holds even when the effects of unobserved heterogeneity are taken into account, which is important because such heterogeneity alone can explain the observed regularity. Contrary to the claims of the critique, these studies do distinguish multiple causes of mortality when the data permit fine distinctions. So, for example, our studies of the mortality of labor unions have analyzed the processes affecting three "competing risks" of mortality: disbanding, absorption by a dominant union, and merger with one or more unions. We find that these various processes differ-they have different dynamics and are affected by different structural and environmental conditions (Hannan 1988c; Hannan and Freeman 1989). 7 The commentary considered only five empirical papers: Freeman and Brittain (1977), Nielsen and Hannan (1977), Hannan and Freeman (1978), Freeman, Carroll, and Hannan (1983), and Freeman and Hannan (1983). Two of these, Freeman and Brittain (1977) and Hannan and Freeman (1978), address only the internal dynamics of organizations, not organizational ecology. Readers might note that many of the papers discussed below had already been published when the critique appeared-Hannan and Freeman (1987) is particularly relevant. Most of the others had been presented at professional meetings and circulated widely in technical report format and were avail- able for consideration. 432</page><page sequence="9">Commentary and Debate Third, ecological research considers the effects of environmental turbu- lence on rates of founding and mortality. Carroll and Delacroix (1982) and Delacroix and Carroll (1983) find that the founding rates and mortal- ity rates of newspapers rise during periods of political turmoil and revolu- tions. This finding has been replicated in studies of newspaper publish- ers in San Francisco, 1840-1975 (Carroll and Huo 1986; Carroll 1987), of similar firms in Finland, 1771-1963 (Amburgey, Lehisalo, and Kelly 1988), and also of ethnic newspapers in the United States, 1880-1915 (West and Olzak 1987). There is interesting confluence of organizational ecology and resource-mobilization theory on this point.8 Periods of po- litical turmoil entail changes in balances of power among contending groups. Newly contending groups apparently create newspapers in order to clarify and spread their views during such periods. Interestingly, news- papers founded during periods of political turmoil have higher than aver- age rates of mortality. Other kinds of environmental change examined include technical change in such diverse industries as minicomputers, plate glass, and cement (Anderson 1988), telephone (Barnett 1988), and semiconductor manufacturing (Freeman and Hannan 1987b, 1987c). Other studies have examined the effects of legal changes in the status of labor unions (Han- nan and Freeman 1987, 1988b), changes in funding for social services (Singh, House, and Tucker 1986; Singh, Tucker, and House 1986), and changes in government regulation of the telephone industry (Barnett and Carroll 1987). Our studies of the foundings and mortality of labor unions estimated effects of variations in immigration, wages, unemployment rates, GNP, business failure rates, and capital investment. Indeed, most of the analyses described here include the effects of environmental condi- tions, time trends or period effects, aging, and competitive interactions within and between populations. Fourth, we have explored why one form of organization has not ex- panded to take on all or most of the activities of modern societies. We address this question by considering trade-offs between generalism (broad adaptive capacity in diverse conditions) and specialism (high growth rates in a limited set of conditions).9 We question the mainline view of organi- zational sociology that environmental variation always favors general- ism. Our study of the mortality of restaurants in 19 cities found that 8 The commentary charges us with blindly following the lead of population biology but also castigates us for incorporating ideas from organization theory and political sociol- ogy. We think that an advantage of our approach is its capacity to incorporate many kinds of sociological insights within its analytic structure. I Carroll's (1985) model of the effects of concentration on the life chances of specialists and generalists, which we regard as a major contribution to organizational ecology, also speaks to these issues. 433</page><page sequence="10">American Journal of Sociology variability does not inevitably favor generalists, but, as our model holds, the effect of variability depends on the "grain" of variations (Freeman and Hannan 1983, 1987a). The same conclusion holds for the semicon- ductor industry (Hannan and Freeman 1989). A fifth direction of research studies the effects of competition within and between populations on rates of founding and mortality. We have formulated models of density dependence in these rates, with density conceptualized as the number of organizations in the population. We assume that processes of competition and legitimation can usefully be represented as functions of density (Hannan 1986b). Our study of national labor unions found the predicted nonmonotonic effect of density on rates of founding (Hannan and Freeman 1987) and mortality (Hannan and Freeman 1988b). Prompted by these findings, researchers have applied the model to other populations. These include studies of exit from the American semiconductor manufacturing industry, 1945-80 (Hannan and Freeman 1989), founding and mortality of independent local telephone compan- ies in several Iowa counties, 1900-17 (Barnett and Carroll 1987), entry into the medical diagnostic-imaging industry, 1959-86 (Mitchell 1987), foundings of voluntary social service organizations in Toronto, 1970-82 (Tucker et al. 1988), founding and mortality rates of newspaper firms in Argentina (1800-1900), Ireland (1800-1970), and the San Fran- cisco area (1840-1975) (Carroll and Hannan, in press), exits from the California wine industry, 1940-85 (Delacroix, Swaminathan, and Solt, in press), and schisms among American Protestant denominations, 1890- 1980 (Sutton, Wuthnow, and Liebman 1988). Organizational ecology has also had an effect on applied research con- cerning business strategy. Brittain and Freeman (1980) examined special- ism and technical innovation as dimensions describing business strategies with implications for rates of founding and mortality of semiconductor manufacturing firms. Freeman and Boeker (1984) have developed the strategic implications of population dynamics and argued that research based on such outcomes can provide an improved empirical base for research on strategy. Carroll (1984) addressed the viability of specialist strategies in newspaper publishing, brewing, music recording, and book publishing. Aldrich and Auster (1986) developed strategic implications of age dependence and size dependence in mortality rates. The tempo of research in organizational ecology has surged in recent years (which makes it especially important to include recent work in any evaluation of either the contributions or the continued promise of the approach). This vitality makes clear that the core processes can be studied empirically with data on diverse kinds of organizations over long historic periods. Ecologists have studied the dynamics of populations of 434</page><page sequence="11">Commentary and Debate market organizations such as newspaper publishers and telephone com- panies. They have also studied such nonmarket organizations as trade associations (Aldrich and Staber 1988), religious denominations (Sutton, Wuthnow, and Liebman 1988), bar associations (Halliday, Powell, and Granfors 1987), mutual benefit life insurance societies (Lehrman 1986), and social movement organizations (McCarthy et al. 1988; Carroll and Huo 1988). The time spans covered are extremely long by the standards of organizational research-longer than a century in many cases. The feasibility of applying this model to diverse populations allows us to learn about the generality of the processes. The capacity to analyze and explain change over long periods makes it possible to build bridges with other branches of macrosociology. Finally, what do we make of the charge that these studies could as well have been motivated by conventional sociological theory, that we have merely relabeled variables and processes? First, there is the fundamental matter of level of analysis. Whereas most organization theory charac- terizes processes at the level of the organization (or of the subunit), our approach works at the population level. Each level has its own distinctive processes, and neither can be reduced mechanically to the other. We think that the population focus helps explain phenomena that cannot be addressed well at the organizational level without resort to ad hoc argu- ments. Consider, for instance, efforts to explain the fact that some organi- zational forms proliferate despite individual organizations' in the popu- lations having poor life chances (e.g., "storefront" churches and social protest organizations). From a population perspective, it is clear that such persistence can result from a high mortality rate's being balanced by a high founding rate (because of low costs of organizing and low complexity). Moreover, the research sketched above has addressed various substan- tive processes that had received little or no systematic empirical attention. The change in theoretical focus led to a sharp alteration in empirical focus. This shift is most notable in studies of the effect of competition and legitimation on rates of founding and mortality. In still other instances, ecological models yield predictions that differ from those of other theo- ries, as in the case of niche width (Freeman and Hannan 1983). We hope that readers interested in assessing the utility of the theoretical research program of organizational ecology will consult the research cited here rather than rely on a caricature. A comprehensive treatment of our program of research can be found in our recently completed monograph, Organizational Ecology (Hannan and Freeman 1989). JOHN FREEMAN MICHAEL T.
