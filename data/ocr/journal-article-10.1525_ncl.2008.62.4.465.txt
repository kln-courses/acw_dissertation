Seward proposed a bill that would provide for the sur- vey and reconnaissance of the Pacifi c Ocean in the interest of  both American commerce and the Christian democratization  of the East. Using language strikingly familiar to readers of Her- man Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Seward offered up a history of  whaling that was both noble and humanitarian: at once the cal- culated instrument of empire and the means for mutually ben- efi cial cultural exchange. The consolidation of these contrary  human endeavors, he claimed, would require “the subjugation  of the monster of the seas to the uses of man.” 1 While Seward  could just as easily have been evoking Ahab’s white whale, he  was instead speaking largely of Japan. Considered alongside Melville’s veiled novel of Pacifi c pol- icy, Seward’s speech is remarkable for its rhetorical confl ation  Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 62, No. 4, pp. 465-492.

Since “War has . . . defaced and saddened  the Atlantic world,” Seward turns his imagination to the Pacifi c,  “the World’s great Hereafter,” where he insists that “Peace is  now to have her sway” (Commerce in the Pacifi c Ocean, p. 13).  There the overlap of commercial interests and providential  duties will surely bring about the “sublime . . . reunion of the  two civilizations, which, having parted on the plains of Asia  four thousand years ago, . . . now meet again on the coasts and  islands of the Pacifi c Ocean” (p. 12). The coming together  of U.S. and Asian cultures, Seward would have his fellow law- makers believe, is not simply another colonization of the exotic  so much as it is a transcendence of cultural difference, a com- ing home. “Commerce,” he insists, will be “the great agent of  this movement” (p. 13). While Melville would not necessarily oppose Seward’s cos- mopolitan vision, at least not in Ishmael’s earnest attempt to  forge a bond rooted in tolerance and understanding with the  pagan South Seas Islander, Queequeg, Moby-Dick does never- theless critique the easy alliance that Seward forges between  Christian ethical imperatives and the wanton fl ow of capital  assigned the task of bringing this vision to fruition. Rather  than invalidating this overlap, however, Melville goes so far as  to fi nd in it not simply the greatest threat to both American  and Japanese interests in the Pacifi c, but the archetypal terror  underwriting American expansionist interests more generally  throughout the world. As Seward went on to play an increas- ingly decisive role in American domestic and foreign policy,  his own early vision of racial reunifi cation through free mar- ket trade would survive neither the American Civil War nor the  actual meeting of the two nations. Instead, it helped set in  motion a series of adversarial confrontations that eventually  “opened” Japan through military-coerced diplomacy. Rejoin- ing this notion of the Pacifi c in 1864, Secretary of State Seward  approved the United States’ participation in the bombardment  of the Japanese port city of Shimonoseki, as part of a larger  operation conducted by a multinational alliance of seventeen  ships whose aim was to compel Japan to trade against its will.

Japan, I  argue, unifi es several recent strains of Melville scholarship that  explore race, empire, and the Pacifi c (or the idea of Melville  “among the nations” more generally).3 Insofar as Moby-Dick de- picts Japan as a “double-bolted” and “impenetrable” culture,4  and therefore one resistant to anatomization by the West, it  complicates recent arguments about nineteenth-century race  culture made by such critics as Carolyn L. Karcher, Russ Cas- tronovo, and Samuel Otter, who examine racialized bodies in  Melville so as to highlight the way in which they are legally, cul- turally, or historically inscribed in the interest of American geo- politics.5 Different from works like “Benito Cereno” (1855),  2 Opposing viewpoints are found in Wai-chee Dimock, Empire for Liberty: Melville and  the Poetics of Individualism (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1989); and Anne Baker,  “Mapping and Measurement in Moby-Dick,” in “Ungraspable Phantom”: Essays on “Moby- Dick,” ed. John Bryant, Mary K. Bercaw Edwards, and Timothy Marr (Kent, Ohio: Kent  State Univ. Press, 2006), pp. 182–96. Dimock argues that the “predestined” narrative  of Moby-Dick shares a strong affi nity with the spatialized economy of Manifest Destiny  precisely because both require an act of mapping to transform desire into providence.  Baker highlights the documented infl uence on Moby-Dick of Charles Wilkes’s Narrative  of the U.S. Exploring Expedition during the Years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842 (1845),  which includes an account of the expedition’s 1838 circumnavigation of the globe (see  “Mapping and Measurement,” pp. 182–84). Couched as a nationalist project intended  to announce the arrival of the United States on the international scene, that mission’s  hidden agenda, Baker claims, was to map some of the uncharted territories of the  globe so as to bring them under the United States’ infl uence. 3 For more on recent attempts to read Melville’s work in international contexts,  see the essays collected in Melville “Among the Nations”: Proceedings of an International  Conference; Volos, Greece, July 2–6, 1997, ed.

In this way, Japan’s complete  refusal to open itself up to the West challenges the very no- tion of empire as it was used in popular discourse of the period:  Japan, to the dismay of American policymakers, was founda- tionally uninterested in political, economic, or cultural ex- change and was, therefore, committed to the erasure of Ameri- can capitalism on and near its shores. Furthering recent work  by Rob Wilson, Thomas Schoonover, and Cesare Casarino, who  adeptly reveal the way in which popular imaginaries served to  mask the race- and labor-based exploitations that brought the  Pacifi c rim under American control,7 I show how Ahab con- fl ates narratives of American Christianity and global commerce  in order to convince the Pequod’s crew to forgo their contracted  whaling mission in favor of a forced confrontation with the rhe- torically interchangeable nemeses that he has created—Moby  Dick and Japan. To understand how Melville’s vision participated in the  manufacture and marketability of terror in the Pacifi c, it is  important to recognize why Japan’s lone refusal to trade with  America (it was the only nation in the Pacifi c to object) inspired  such outrage as to initiate a violent opening of its mystery. Spe- cifi cally, when confronted with the sudden terror of the Pacifi c  Ocean, emptied of all prescribed meaning, how did the twinned  agents of Western Christianity and American commerce rush to  fi ll its vacuum? Though much has been written on the topic of  Melville and the Pacifi c more generally,8 I want to emphasize 6 See Michael Paul Rogin, Subversive Genealogy: The Politics and Art of Herman Melville  (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1979); and Gregg D.

Perry, and other American industrialists who wanted to claim  exclusive rights to the Pacifi c as a place for future national and  commercial imaginings. As a complex socioeconomic trope,  Melville’s Japan differs from Melville’s Pacifi c in that the “her- metic empire” represents for him the antipode to American  military industrialism. While Melville’s other works expressed  fears that increased U.S. infl uence in the region would threaten  the cultural integrity of those Pacifi c islands he had visited as a  younger man (i.e., Typee [1846] and Omoo [1847]), or that the  New and Old Worlds would both compete and conspire against  one another so as to suppress the rise of the Third World (i.e.,  “Benito Cereno”), Moby-Dick largely ignores such anxieties  only with respect to Japan. Thus, while Ahab rallies the crew to  avenge his previous “dismasting” by Moby Dick in Japanese wa- ters, Ishmael advocates for the global supremacy of the whaling  industry, one that “cleared the way for the missionary and the  merchant” in the Pacifi c, and is now “on the threshold” of top- pling the lone dissenter in the region (Moby-Dick, p. 110). Japanese statesman Tokugawa Nariaki’s observation that  “literary and military [training] are not incompatible” does not  simply articulate the predominant method by which Japan of- fered resistance to the West, but also describes the means by  which America plotted the arrival of the infamous black ships  in Edo Bay on the evening of 2 July 1853, a scant two years after  Melville took up the same challenge in Moby-Dick.9 A number 1980), which examines Melville’s novels alongside the travel narratives of missionaries  and colonialists in the nineteenth century, to Rodrigo J.

In order to help promote his way of life, he founded a school in  Mito, the motto of which was “Harmonious balance between literary and military arts.”  Having once been in charge of Japanese efforts to prohibit the infl uence of foreigners,  he insisted that no agreements be made with the United States. Even after the Treaty  of Kanagawa was signed, he led an opposition group whose aim was to bring about its  renunciation. In his observations on coastal defense, Tokugawa opposes any sort of  peaceful resolution between the two nations, in part because of the corrosive effects of  Western religion on Japanese culture: “The prohibition of Christianity is the fi rst rule  C4746.indb   469 3/19/08   6:55:43 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> 470 nineteenth-century literature of recent studies have looked at the diplomatic procedures  leading up to the Treaty of Kanagawa (signed on 31 March  1854), yet none has adequately examined the mechanisms of  coercion used to accomplish this hostile takeover of Japanese  culture without bloodshed. Rather than treating this brand  of gunboat diplomacy as a laudable victory of persuasion over  outright militarism (as many of Perry’s supporters continue to  do), we should see the United States’ presence in Japan leading  up to the treaty as an insidious supplement to violence—a war  waged in American and Japanese print rather than between  armed combatants. There are, of course, reasonable limits to this approach.  For example, Christopher Benfey’s recent “wave theory” of cul- tural exchange (as opposed to a “particle theory” that would  focus on the movement of material objects) suggests that Mel- ville’s depiction of Japan as a “double-bolted” empire is apropos  to the dual military and cultural campaigns required to fi nally  persuade Japan to submit to trade.10 According to Benfey in  “Herman Melville and John Manjiro,” “Perry did the easy part,  forcing Japan to open her major ports to Western ships and  Western trade.” There followed, he argues, a more signifi cant  second opening of Japan, one that could only take place in the  centers of cultures more broadly: It was one thing to fi re a few cannonballs across Edo Bay and run  a miniature railroad along the beach to impress the samurai. It  was quite another to grasp the subtle moves of judo, the tenets of  Esoteric Buddhism, or to understand why the most highly prized  of the Tokugawa house. Public notices concerning it are posted everywhere, even to  the  remotest corner of every province. . . . Yet if the Americans are allowed to come  again this religion will inevitably raise its head once more, however strict the prohibi- tion; and this, I fear, is something we could never justify to the spirits of our ancestors”  (Tokugawa Nariaki to Bakufu, 14 August 1853, in Select Documents on Japanese Foreign  Policy, 1853–1868, ed. and trans. W. G. Beasley [London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1955],  pp. 103–4). 10 Benfey introduces this theory in his The Great Wave: Gilded Age Misfi ts, Japanese  Eccentrics, and the Opening of Old Japan (New York: Random House, 2003), but he elabo- rates on it more recently in his “Herman Melville and John Manjiro: Toward a Wave  Theory of the Pacifi c,” Common-Place, 5, no. 2 (2005), available online at &lt;http://www .common-place.org/vol-05/no-02/benfey/index.shtml&gt;.

Benfey goes on to valorize a critical methodology that focuses  on the cultural changes that take place in the individual, a  colonization of the mind that results from a “constant oscilla- tion, a great wave, between East and West,” as opposed to the  quantifi able exchange of, say, Japanese art objects and Ameri- can technology. While this cultural history is a crucial one  (though one that would require the cooperation of Japanese  and American scholars as well as a language common and com- fortable to each), there is another way to think about the coer- cive power of culture to turn paper treaties into lived lives: the  Treaty of Kanagawa might equally be seen not as the beginning  of a negotiation between empires, but as the culmination of  a set of unnatural national impulses, ones that needed to be  manufactured before any treaty between the two nations could  take place. This approach concerns itself foremost with the  narrative quality of America’s nonviolent military invasion of  Japan. The conquest of Japan was, historically speaking, a milita- rized literary project—which is to say that, since no brute force  was ever used by either side, this particular confl ict was strate- gized, waged, and fi nalized largely on paper; its aim was to sway  the popular imagination by manipulating the more subtle mi- nutia of etiquette and custom. Together, the interrelated work  of three men—Senator (later Secretary of State) William H.  Seward, Commodore Matthew Perry, and novelist Herman  Melville—highlights the ability of a literary-minded frame of  reference to instill in the popular American imagination the  belief that Japan represented something like the limit of Amer- ican exceptionalist logic in its aggressive confl ation of mission- ary and merchant work in the Pacifi c. Melville’s morally am- biguous allegory of America’s confrontation with its mirrored  Other stands out because it both opposes and contributes to  this process. As I will show, Moby-Dick produces a demonized  analogue for Japan (i.e., the whale) only then to have Ameri- can industry destroyed by it. Not only was Melville the writer most responsible for shap- C4746.indb   471 3/19/08   6:55:44 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> 472 nineteenth-century literature ing America’s views about the Pacifi c, but, because Moby-Dick  examines Japan according to the same frame of reference that  Seward and Perry do, Melville additionally offered an important  critique of the means by which they made that nation an ethical  target, as opposed to simply another opportunity for commerce.  In particular, Ahab’s rhetorical usurpation of the Pequod fuses  Seward’s Christian imperialism with Perry’s terror-driven com- merce in such a way as to further the course of American empire  without explicitly aiming to do so. In order to dissect Japan’s  special function in American expansionist logic, however, Mel- ville would fi rst need to perfect its terrifying ubiquity; in other  words, Moby Dick would need to become an assemblage of con- sciousness, a fusion of the various terrors that Japan only mar- ginally represented elsewhere in the American campaign, in or- der then to have the American whaler self-destruct in its pursuit. When read together in this way, the work of Seward, Perry,  and Melville suggests that the American imagination produced  the terror by which Japan was regarded as a unique and spe- cial enemy not only to America but to the West more generally.  Once manufactured, however, this terror could no longer be  controlled. The forged bond between commercial interest and  Christian duty could not be so easily dismantled, to the extent  that the United States found itself victimized by the literariness  of its own invention. Because Japan had been hyperbolically  vilifi ed so as to convince Americans to oppose it, its surprising  resistance was not only embarrassing, but also terrifying. Japan,  in turn, became the geopolitical analogue to Melville’s white  whale, regarded as an internalized threat to the stability of the  burgeoning global marketplace. Finally, in order to ensure  Japan’s submission, a second, corollary form of terror was de- ployed in the interest of American naval diplomacy. Through  a multimedia campaign that Rob Wilson calls “a spectacle of  maritime ambition” (Reimagining the Pacifi c, p. 84), the tech- nologically superior United States ensured that Japan would  submit to the intervention of Western “marketplace religion” 11  without the xenophobic messiness of hand-to-hand combat. 11 I take the phrase “marketplace religion” from Donald E.

As U.S. Sec- retary of State in 1867, long after his “Commerce in the Pacifi c  Ocean” speech, Seward included the following verse in a pri- vate letter: Our nation with united interests blest, Not now content to poise, shall sway the rest; Abroad our empire shall no limits know, But like the sea in boundless circles fl ow.12 Though these couplets imply that the United States’ post-Civil  War reunifi cation in essence qualifi ed it to export America  around the globe, there is ample evidence elsewhere to suggest  that Seward’s intent was not perhaps as foreboding as his poetry  might indicate; Seward was primarily concerned with securing  America’s infl uence within what, in an 1868 speech, he called  “the magic circle of the Monroe Doctrine.” 13 In addition, de- spite his numerous calls to expand the scope of both American  territory and trade, Seward equally insisted that “Americans  qualify morally for empire” (Paolino, Foundations of the Amer- ican Empire, p. 4). He believed that only a just United States  could, in good faith, pursue imperialist aims for the betterment  of mankind. Under the auspices of moral absolution, such an  Press, 1987), p. 237. Pease argues that Starbuck’s opposition to Ahab derives from  his faith in God and his belief in laissez-faire capitalism. Their confl ation compels  him to oppose Ahab’s quest for revenge, in favor of upholding the initial contract  to hunt whales that was signed by everyone on board the Pequod. Ahab does not so  much deny Starbuck’s charges as twist them into further justifi cation for his own  revenge-quest. 12 Seward, letter to Philip Tomppert, et al., 10 May 1867, quoted in Ernest N.

If America had  to act justly, then so did its neighbors. Seward viewed domestic and foreign affairs to be theoreti- cally and practically contiguous with one another.14 An out- spoken opponent of slavery’s spread into the new American  territories, Seward largely feared that its inclusion would mor- ally disqualify the United States from pursuing its justifi able  imperialist projects elsewhere. The lure of the Pacifi c forcefully  complicated these views, however, as Seward declared before  Congress in 1850 that he would vote for the admission of Cali- fornia even if it were to enter as a slave state, due in large part  to its absolute necessity in carrying out America’s providential  promise. Simply put, gaining California was more important to  Seward than losing the South.15 If acquiring California was essential to America’s conquest  of the Pacifi c, then so too was the need to demystify the per- ception of Japan as a resistant empire looming at the termi- nus of American expansionist logic. That Japan posed a special  threat is unmistakable, as is the fact that the failure of Japanese  citizens to warm up to “the sudden and complete revolution of  national habits” was, for Seward at least, not merely an over- sight, but an offense to the family of nations.16 Even so, as con- cerned as he was with the future commercial relations between  the two nations, Seward was ultimately less offended by Japan’s  unwillingness to trade with the West than he was with its refusal  to allow the import and formalized practice of Christianity. In  fact, Seward went so far as to entertain the idea of initiating an  all-out holy war against the Empire, at one point threatening to  revoke the treaty powers between the two nations in order to  14 See Paolino, Foundations of the American Empire, p. 5. 15 Seward went so far as to depict the potential loss of California as a “dismember- ment of the empire” (Paolino, Foundations of the American Empire, p. 4). This language,  of course, parallels Ahab’s loss of limb off the coast of Japan; in a more general sense,  it also suggests the extent to which the trauma of individual bodily harm becomes rhe- torically commensurable with the anthropomorphic rendering of the body politic. 16 Seward, letter to Robert H. Pruyn, 15 November 1861, quoted in Paolino, Foun- dations of the American Empire, p. 171.

Seward threatened that “when one  foreign Christian shall have suffered martyrdom in Japan,” the  entire Western world would mobilize to oppose her.17 Japan had undergone just this sort of religious proselytiz- ing once before, under the direction of the Portuguese in the  sixteenth century.18 Japanese offi cials were initially tolerant of  Christianity because they were interested in pursuing foreign  trade, to the extent that by 1582 there were around fi fteen  thousand Christian converts in Japan. In 1614, however, the  government campaigned against the ongoing decay of Japanese  culture and tradition. All missionaries were formally expelled,  and the religion was offi cially outlawed. Throughout the 1630s  a series of increasingly strict rules designed to reunify Japan  and instill a national identity in effect sealed the empire from  all foreign infl uence. At that time, more than thirty thousand  Japanese Christians were put to death when they opposed the  new law. (To test their faith, suspected Christians were made to  undergo fumie, a forced treading on a bronze plate of the Ma- donna and Child; those who refused were put to death.) These  attitudes remained more or less unchanged during the inter- vening two centuries, and were not tested again until American  whalers began appearing off the coast of Japan with increasing  frequency, beginning in the 1830s. In effect, then, Christianity became a fulcrum point for  American-Japanese negotiations. Not only did it serve as the  rhetorical (and perhaps real) justifi cation for American inter- vention in the Pacifi c—as a Christianizing mission intended to  bring God to the heathens, but also as the manifest impera- tive of the American people more generally—but it also served  17 While Seward’s support of Christianity was no secret from the public, these  particular sentiments were expressed to Robert V. Van Valkenburgh, then Minister to  Japan, in a letter written 5 October 1868 (see Paolino, Foundations of the American Em- pire, p. 172). 18 My discussion of the Christianization of Japan is largely informed by the  thorough treatment of the subject in The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 4: Early Mod- ern Japan, ed.

William Seward’s atti- tude typifi es the “Christian imperialism” that men like Com- modore Perry would rely on in the procurement of commercial  supremacy in the Pacifi c. As the man most directly involved in making Seward’s  vision a reality (via a signed treaty), Perry knew full well the  need to deny the imperial aims of the mission to Japan, even  as he readied his ships for the possibility of war. Service in the  navy dominated his family history, ever since Christopher Perry  enlisted in the fi rst American navy during the Revolutionary  War. Perry himself had fi rst gone to sea in 1809 at the age of  fi fteen, aboard the aptly named schooner Revenge. In the War of  1812, Perry’s older brother Oliver Hazard rose to prominence,  while Perry himself saw little action and remained largely  ignored. According to Peter Booth Wiley, Oliver Hazard Perry’s  heroism and victory in the Battle of Lake Eerie “literally saved  the nation,” since the British would have otherwise severed the  territorial United States by separating the western frontier from  the eastern seaboard.19 Against his brother’s all-out militarism,  Matthew Perry would instead come to be publicly praised for  his forceful diplomacy. In a private letter to the Secretary of the Navy in 1851,  Perry outlined his proposed response to atrocities committed  by the Japanese against American sailors, the most famous ex- ample of which involved the American whaler Lagoda, whose  crew had gone down off the coast of Japan in 1848. There the  survivors were discovered by Japanese offi cials, transported to  Nagasaki, and put in cages to await their eventual beheading.  With the help of the Dutch, however, the men were eventually  released to the U.S.S. Preble, with a stern warning that future  contact with foreigners would not be tolerated. Astute enough  to mask the desire for revenge at its core, Perry nevertheless  confessed in a private letter to the Secretary of the Navy that  “the real object of the expedition . . . should be concealed from  19 Peter Booth Wiley with Korogi Ichiro, Yankees in the Land of the Gods: Commodore  Perry and the Opening of Japan (New York: Viking, 1990), p. 46.

Once plans were fi nalized for the Japan expedition, Perry  began to acquaint himself with Japanese culture to the extent  that the literature of the day would allow. He collected cop- ies of all available European books about Japan, including  Philipp Franz von Siebold’s Nippon, Archiv zur Beschreibung von  Japan (1832–58). (Siebold would eventually petition to join  the expedition; upon Perry’s refusal, he joined a Russian vessel  that also arrived in Japan in 1853, later publishing a brochure  claiming that Russia, and not the United States, had opened  Japan.)21 Perry also began soliciting artists and scientists who  were to collect data and submit reports on topics ranging from  geology to botany. He additionally acquired a small printing  press that would allow him quickly to produce pamphlets in- tended to malign the European nations that stood in America’s  way—particularly the Dutch, who were at the time granted per- mission to trade with the Japanese once a year.22 Recognizing  the mission’s narrative quality, Perry hired Bayard Taylor, one  of the most popular American travel writers of the moment, to  provide a professional account of the voyage in the name of  posterity. Eventually, however, Perry would sequester Taylor’s  diary along with those of other crewmembers, so that he could  regain control over his own legacy. By the time of Perry’s arrival in 1853, Edo (now Tokyo)  was the largest city in the world, with a population around one  20 Perry, letter to William A.

Internal contradictions were threatening the idyllic  peace that the city and the region had enjoyed for over one  hundred and fi fty years. Critics in Japan began to speak of naiyu- gaikan, or “troubles at home and dangers from abroad.” Sensing  this mounting concern, Perry stressed the geopolitical necessity  for establishing relations between the two nations before in- evitable contact with the West was made under less sympathetic  conditions—American industry lay just twenty days away by  ship. Perry emphasized the United States’ independence from  the nations of Europe, adeptly highlighting the fact that its gov- ernment was prohibited from interfering in the religious prac- tices of its own citizens or those of other nations. After many  months of negotiations, the Treaty was fi nalized on 31 March  1854, though not before the words “in the year of our Lord Je- sus Christ” were stricken from all but the English version (other  copies were submitted in Japanese, Dutch, and Chinese).23 Returning to New York in 1855, Perry was surprised to  learn that the uncompromising nature of his success was pre- cisely what denied him a hero’s welcome: the opening of Japan  was perceived as yet another instance of U.S. territorial expan- sion that would destabilize the tenuous domestic status quo.  Through correspondences with mainland Americans, Perry  had been assured that his name would soon be included among  the pantheon of world diplomats—Columbus, Magellan,  Cook—for having peacefully brought Japan “into the family of  Nations.” A letter written to Perry by infl uential representatives  of American industry went so far as to declare that “by striving  with the obstacles of Nature, you have conquered the obstinate  will of man,” and that “by overturning the cherished policy of  an Empire,” he had, among other things, protected their vast  economic interest in the region.24 Yet just six weeks before the  arrival of Perry’s Treaty of Kanagawa, which established future  trade with Japan, the Kansas-Nebraska Act had directed atten- tion toward the future of slavery in the disputed territories—a  23 A facsimile of the original English version of the treaty can be viewed online  through the National Archives at http://www.archives.gov. 24 Quoted in Wiley, Yankees in the Land of the Gods, p. 453.

After sequestering all jour- nals and other personal materials from the mission, he paid a  visit to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was then serving as the Amer- ican consul to Liverpool. Aware that Hawthorne had recently  penned a presidential campaign biography for fellow Demo- crat Franklin Pierce, Perry asked if he would do the same for  him. Hawthorne’s refusal is not surprising, particularly given his  belief that “the world can scarcely have in reserve a less hack- nied theme than Japan.” 26 Hawthorne’s journal also reveals that  although Perry had “some acquaintance with the literature of  the day,” he did not grasp at Hawthorne’s suggestion of an al- ternative biographer: the famed South Seas explorer and docu- mentarian, Herman Melville (English Notebooks, pp. 147–48).  This is understandable. Melville’s novel White-Jacket (1850) had  recently helped to limit the scope and severity of maritime dis- cipline, something that Perry clearly opposed—in fact, it was  during an earlier diplomatic trip to Russia that Perry’s own ship  Concord became “the cause of the fi rst government investiga- tion of fl ogging” (Yankees in the Land of the Gods, p. 66).27 25 Thomas Schoonover further places this national impulse in the context of Ameri- ca’s standing in the international community. Characterizing the discourse of American  exceptionalism as rather commonplace, he suggests that “the U.S. vision of expanding  territory, commerce, and security interests, and an ill-defi ned civilizing mission, were  rooted in the European heritage and by no means unique” (Uncle Sam’s War of 1898 and  the Origins of Globalization, p. 12). Among the many motivations for American expan- sion, he lists the following: “visions of wealth from conquests, purchases, settlements,  various exploratory expeditions, the tension between materialism and idealism, public  policies of encouragement (such as the Homestead Act), the technological benefi ts of  the telegraph and railroads, and continual U.S. activity in the Pacifi c basin” (p. 12). 26 Nathaniel Hawthorne, entry for 28 December 1854, in his The English Notebooks,  1853–1856, ed. Thomas Woodson and Bill Ellis, vol. 21 of The Centenary Edition of the  Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne (Columbus: Ohio State Univ. Press, 1997), p. 148. 27 Perhaps the oddest confrontation between Perry and the specter of Melville  occurred in 1853 on Peel Island. It was there that Perry’s party fi red a series of warning  shots into the air after becoming lost, only to be greeted by a man named Judge who,  along with a companion, guided the men to safety. Covered in blue tattoos, he was a  native of Nuku Hiva, the same island that formed the basis for Melville’s Typee. See  Wiley, Yankees in the Land of the Gods, p. 210.

Mel- ville, more than any other American writer of the period, had  already opened up Japanese waters to the popular American  imagination. His intent, however, was to warn against further  American intervention in the region. Specifi cally, he feared  that U.S. interests would contribute to the destruction of the  native cultures that he had visited as a younger man and docu- mented in such enormously popular travel narratives as Typee  and Omoo. A decade before he would dedicate Moby- Dick to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne’s genius, Melville went  to sea aboard the whaler Acushnet. It was during this trip that he  famously deserted the ship on the island of Nuku Hiva, knowing  full well that the offense was punishable by fl ogging, imprison- ment, or worse. There he lived among the natives for four  weeks, until he gained passage on board the Nantucket-based  Charles and Henry, which was destined for the Sandwich Islands.  Melville’s popular accounts of his time in the South Seas made  him a household name and afforded him the unique opportu- nity to shape America’s view of the Pacifi c in the decade before  the U.S. government, through survey and treaty, would attempt  to do the same. In Typee and elsewhere Melville was quick to criticize  the American impulse to intervene in the affairs of other na- tions, particularly in those locations where he had himself  spent extensive time. According to Christopher Sten, this lo- cal knowledge led Melville to acquire “a new respect for an- other culture as a culture, in all its material forms; and a new  sense of himself as different from, but in no way superior to, his  C4746.indb   480 3/19/08   6:55:45 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> melville’s japan 481 hosts.” 28 Sten further suggests that while Melville was highly  critical of the European missionary presence in Polynesia, he  was not prepared entirely to dismiss the potential value of  Christianity; he remained optimistic about “the spiritual oppor- tunity the missionaries offered by translating the Bible into the  natives’ own tongue” (“Melville’s Cosmopolitanism,” p. 39). Yet  while in these early writings Melville was able to remain even a  little optimistic about America’s intervention in foreign affairs,  in Moby-Dick he no longer imagines this possibility. Instead, it is  a novel consumed by the failure of American ambition to pre- scribe its own limits. In chapter 118,  “The Quadrant,” Melville unifi es at least  twenty previous references to Japan in Moby-Dick, most of  which are tied in some way to the white whale.29 In this episode  Ahab fi nally internalizes the relationship between the two, and  smashes his trusted navigational instrumentation as a result.  When the Pequod fi rst enters the “Japanese sea” in pursuit of  Moby Dick, Ahab regards what he calls “that unblinkingly vivid  Japanese sun” to be “the blazing focus of the glassy ocean’s im- measurable burning-glass” (Moby-Dick, p. 500). Because Japan’s  unblinking eye dominates the entire scene (even the sky itself  “looks lacquered”—or, indeed, japanned), Ahab further sur- mises that it must therefore also have intimate knowledge of  the white whale. He asks the sun: “Where is Moby Dick? This  instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into  the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the  eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the un- known, thither side of thee, thou sun!” (p. 501). As it is directly  28 Christopher Sten, “Melville’s Cosmopolitanism: A Map for Living in a (Post-)  Colonialist World,” in Melville “Among the Nations,” p. 39. 29 For example, in the description of Ahab’s “dismasting” by Moby Dick in the  “Ahab” chapter we learn that Ahab’s wound was suffered off the coast of Japan and that  the leg’s replacement is “from the polished bone of the sperm whale’s jaw” (Moby-Dick,  p. 124). Ahab’s dismasting is further tied to Japan when we recall that the Pequod’s  masts were themselves “cut somewhere on the coast of Japan” (p. 69). Thus, Ahab,  Moby Dick, and Japan participate in a complex prosthetic exchange of masting and dis- masting. For more on how an American whaler might have obtained masts from Japan,  see Sister M. Blish, “Melville and the Sea Drifters of Japan,” Melville Society Extracts, no.  76 (1989), 14–16.

Though it is equipped with “colored glasses” that allow  Ahab “to take sight of that solar fi re” (p. 500), the quadrant is  ultimately no match for Japan’s own purview of the Pacifi c, one  that is both concentrated and ubiquitous. Prefi guring Seward  and Perry’s imminent mapping of the Pacifi c, however, Ahab  rejects such an enterprise, calling the quadrant a “Foolish . . .  plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Cap- tains” (p. 501). Unwilling to bow to the Japanese sun, Ahab  splits his quest for Moby Dick from the inimical empire that  has gained control over not only the sea and sky but “Enlight- enment epistemology” itself, by cursing and trampling the pri- mary surveying tool of the West (Baker, “Mapping and Mea- surement,” p. 194). Russell Reising and Peter J. Kvidera detail Melville’s strate- gic placement of Japan and Japanese icons and images through- out Moby-Dick as part of what they call “an elaborate geo-tropics  intended to bear the weight of his complicated thematic inten- tions.” 30 By situating their observations in the context of U.S.  imperialism, they likewise argue that Ishmael’s repeated refer- ences to Japan differ from those of every other named place  in the novel, largely owing to its political and aesthetic status  as “unknown.” 31 While Reising and Kvidera conclude, however,  that Ishmael and Ahab each invent “a metaphysical rationale  for expanding global markets” and that Ishmael’s particu- lar interest in the whale is both narrative and commercial, I  argue that Moby-Dick additionally opposes U.S. policy by dem- onstrating that apocalyptic violence is both the justifi cation for  30 Reising and Kvidera, “Fast Fish and Raw Fish: Moby-Dick, Japan, and Melville’s  Thematics of Geography,” New England Quarterly, 70 (1997), 285. 31 Reising and Kvidera claim that Melville is acutely aware of the United States’  imperialist history with respect to the Pacifi c Ocean. Citing an 1815 letter by David  Porter, whom they refer to as “America’s fi rst naval imperialist,” urging President James  Madison “to open up the Pacifi c, especially Japan,” to American commerce (“Fast Fish  and Raw Fish,” p. 302), they trace a history of U.S. naval participation in the coercion  of global trade, about which they demonstrate Melville’s own knowledge and critique.

As the origin of  the doubloon’s talismanic power, the whale serves both as the  demonized cipher around which the circulation of commerce  is organized and as the justifi cation for laissez-faire American  capitalism turned gunboat diplomacy in the Far East. In effect,  Melville gives not a face but a “pasteboard” and “unreasoning  mask” 32 to the distinct American evil by which Seward moves  the nation westward, from the gold fi elds of California to the  gold-doubloon-masted quarterdecks of the Americanized  Pacifi c. Moby-Dick’s particular value comes from the attention that  Melville pays to the manufacture and marketability of terror in  the Pacifi c theater of wanton globality. Melville’s novel, how- ever, also calls into being the very terror that it is plotted to warn  against, in effect rendering nightmarish that same “bottom- less deep” from which America derives its global advantage.33  The menacing image of the whale used to force the Pequod into  Japanese waters, it seems, cannot help but then materialize in  order to destroy the ship once it arrives. In particular, this con- nection between the gold doubloon that Ahab uses to lure the  crew to exact his revenge and the white whale as the “sublime  commodity” in American Christian and capitalist logic (Wilson,  Reimagining the Pacifi c, p. 84) forms the basis for Melville’s cri- tique of the United States’ designs on Japan. Though Ishmael’s  discourse on the “high and mighty business of whaling” is in- formed by the activities of Secretary of the Navy John P. Ken- nedy, Commodore James Biddle, Seward, Perry, and a great  many other political and economic policymakers,34 Melville ul- 32 These are phrases that Ahab uses to vilify Moby Dick in “The Quarter-Deck”  (Moby-Dick, p. 164). 33 The Japanese empire, by its defi ance, internalized this fear more completely  than did any other Pacifi c nation. Not only did Japanese law prohibit visitation from  the West, but it additionally sentenced to death any sailor who returned after hav- ing left. 34 For a more detailed account of this relationship, see Reising and Kvidera, “Fast  Fish and Raw Fish,” pp. 289–90, 303–4.

This made good economic sense, especially when  one considers the following: from 1830 to 1861 “no fewer than  722 of the world’s 900 whalers were American fl agged vessels,”  and many of the others were owned or operated by expatriated  Nantucketers; in addition, “the value of the whaling fl eet and  one year’s harvest was roughly equal to the national budget”  (Schoonover, Uncle Sam’s War of 1898, p. 13).35 Moreover, up  until the Civil War, the oil (spermaceti) harvested by New Eng- land whalers was the primary source for home lighting and the  lubrication of industrial machinery.36 In 1851, the year Mel- ville published his novel, American shipping dominated world  trade, while the U.S. Navy ranked fi fth among world powers.37 This is to say that the American whaler, as Melville himself  could attest, afforded a military and commercial advantage not  present in any other industry or available to any other nation.  He could thus boldly declare: Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;  . . . two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other  seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are  but extension bridges; armed ones but fl oating forts; even pirates  and privateers . . . they but plunder other ships, other fragments  of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living  from the bottomless deep itself. (Moby-Dick, p. 64) The Pacifi c alone, Ishmael goes on to argue, occupies “the mid- most waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being  but its arms” (p. 482). As a result, the Pacifi c Ocean provided  both a limitless resource for profi t and fuel as well as a medium  35 Schoonover lists these among several factors in the origin of globalization in the  1840s. 36 See Samuel Eliot Morison, “Old Bruin”: Commodore Matthew Perry, 1994–1858:  The American Naval Offi cer Who Helped Found Liberia, Hunted Pirates in the West Indies, Prac- tised Diplomacy with the Sultan of Turkey and the King of the Two Sicilies; Commanded the Gulf  Squadron in the Mexican War, Promoted the Steam Navy and the Shell Gun, and Conducted the  Naval Expedition Which Opened Japan (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1967), p. 265. 37 See Wiley, Yankees in the Land of the Gods, p. 77.

At the same time, its centripetal counterpart brought the island  nations increasingly under the infl uence of the United States. The methodology by which Ahab commandeers the will  of the crew is symptomatic of the same American exceptional- ist attitudes that Seward draws on in order to justify American  intervention in the region. Both Seward and Ahab suggest that  industry can be used to facilitate the inevitable conversion of Pa- cifi c nations to both capitalism and Christianity. Because Ahab  boldly leads the charge toward Moby Dick and Japan, many crit- ics have strained to fi nd in Ishmael some viable anti-imperialist alternative. Against this oversimplifi ed reading, Reising and  Kvidera instead argue that Ishmael’s interest in and mystifi cation  of Japan, in essence, “betrays . . . a fascination with one dimen- sion of an American expansionism he otherwise abhors. Insofar  as he privileges the industry of whaling, then, he too, like Ahab,  not in contrast to him, looks toward a future in which America  dominates the globe” (“Fast Fish and Raw Fish,” p. 299). But Melville was neither Ahab nor Ishmael. Instead, he  exposed the violence underwriting Seward’s peaceful rhetoric  at the same time that he rendered Ahab’s overt language of  righteous vengeance equally insidious for its ability to be made  sympathetic. In this context, Moby-Dick is essentially a novel  about the marketability of terror. It asks us to rethink the way in  which terror produces an irrational space into which American  merchant and missionary desires are introduced and disassoci- ated; only then are these desires rediscovered and ostensibly  hunted down according to the very same principles by which  they themselves come into being. In other words, all of the  terrors and fears caused by Japan’s unwillingness to trade with  the West or to provide a safe haven for American whaling ships,  though the best hunting grounds were adjacent to its shore,  become anthropomorphized in the white whale’s ubiquitous  and impenetrable defi ance of the American captain’s revenge. In his account of Perry’s expedition to  Japan, German-born artist Wilhelm Heine (a man whose  C4746.indb   485 3/19/08   6:55:46 AM </page> <page sequence="22"> 486 nineteenth-century literature work was largely responsible for giving Americans their fi rst  glimpse of Japan) proudly recalled the admiration and awe that  accompanied the unveiling of a miniature locomotive that had  been shipped in pieces and reassembled to run along a circular  track one mile in circumference.38 Other, no less spectacular  gifts followed. Ignoring its obvious and sinister paternalism,  Heine insisted that America’s gesture was without precedent: One of our mechanics tested a high-pressure fi re-fi ghting  apparatus. What hilarity when the stream hit a crowd of gawk- ing Japanese and knocked them into a heap! . . . The others  [gifts] included a number of the well-known Colts (six-shooters),  as well as beautiful examples of Hall’s rifl es (twenty-four-shot),  manufactured articles of all kinds, cloth, and fi nally the most  lovely editions of books by American authors (among them even  a splendid Audubon, Birds of America, the renowned monument  to natural science). In sum, these things constituted one of the  most valuable gifts ever brought and presented by one nation to  another. . . . This can probably be called unique, a pioneer act of  generosity never duplicated. (With Perry to Japan, pp. 126–27) Embedded in this catalog of gifts is an implicit reverence for  what David E. Nye calls the “American technological sublime,”  meaning those “sublime technological objects [that] were as- sumed to be active forces working for democracy,” but that  nevert heless come to manifest “a split between those who  unders tand and control machines and those who do not.” 39  From agri cultural innovations to life-saving technologies, from  beautifully crafted fi repower to the splendid exemplum of  American publishing, Birds of America (1827–38), these items  are achievements of both American craftsmanship and inge- 38 See Wilhelm Heine, With Perry to Japan: A Memoir, trans. Frederic Trautmann  (Honolulu: Univ. of Hawaii Press, 1990), p. 126. While Heine’s journalistic account  of the mission is signifi cant, Frederic Trautmann argues that Heine’s “greatest service  to America” came about as a result of the hundreds of sketches, landscapes, portraits,  and watercolors he produced during the expedition (Trautmann, preface to With Perry  to Japan, p. xii). Heine’s Graphic Scenes in the Japan Expedition (1856) helped launch the  American craze for Japanese art, furniture, pottery, and architecture that followed the  mission. 39 Nye, American Technological Sublime (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1994),  pp. 33, 60.

Accordingly, the Japanese already knew and feared much  about America; in addition to questions about the progress  of the transcontinental railroad, Heine reports being asked,  “Does Mexico still exist? Or has the United States conquered it  by now?” (With Perry to Japan, p. 75). One of Moby-Dick’s most persuasive anti-imperialist argu- ments concerns the tragicomic performance of American  industry collapsing under the strain of its own aspirations. Rob  Wilson goes so far as to connect the Pequod’s catastrophic dis- mantling off the coast of Japan with Commodore Perry’s sub- sequent exposure of the Japanese to the inevitability of “the  world capitalist market” (Reimagining the Pacifi c, p. 84). “As if  to terrify Japan with a spectacle of maritime ambition in the  Pacifi c,” Wilson writes, “Captain Ahab’s own Pequod is destroyed  by that specter of the national sublime—Moby-Dick as sublime  commodity” (p. 84). And yet this commitment to catastrophe  itself anticipates the technocratic bombardment that would  shortly compel Japan to submit to the West: “If the English- reading Japanese were not impressed by Melville’s spectacle of  Pacifi c might and his transcendentalized antagonists in Ahab/ Ishmael, they would be, as Emerson argued, by such techno- logical spectacles as the train and the telegraph, which Com- modore Perry brought in miniature” (Reimagining the Pacifi c,  p. 84). Made portable, these foretokens themselves constituted  an embedded argument about the inevitable reduction of ne- gotiable space between the two nations. No true gifts at all, they  would eventually become among the fi rst American items pur- chased by the Japanese.40 These American displays of industrial, military, and eco- nomic power both manufactured and responded to a set of  terrors associated with the Pacifi c. This is to say that William  Seward’s moniker of the Pacifi c as the “great Hereafter” where  “Peace is now to have her sway” was both a rhetorical means  to an economic and religious end and a wish that its enormity  would turn out to be a benevolent space for the conveyance  40 See Wiley, Yankees in the Land of the Gods, p. 110.

These fears could only have been accentuated by their  duplication. Just as Seward and Perry’s expedition to Japan was  partly in response to the earlier ill treatment of the Lagoda’s  crew, so the visionary center of Ahab’s quest is formed in the  traumatic moment of his disfi gurement—a previous, chance  encounter that, lest we forget, leaves him “dismasted off Japan”  and in need of a prosthetic limb to continue his warmonger- ing (Moby-Dick, p. 124). While the ultimate terror is projected  onto the oil-bearing leviathan, it is the projectors—Ahab and  Co.—that are rendered monstrous. It is Ahab’s leg that splin- ters under the pressure of his own vengeance and that must be  rebuilt, like the butt of some cosmic joke, “from the polished  bone of the sperm whale’s jaw” (Moby-Dick, p. 124). Ahab, it  seems, can only be restored by internalizing and fusing himself  to the very creature he loathes. Terror as white whale; white whale as impenetrable Japan.  The creation and deployment of a mesmerizing mutual joint- stock fear in the Pacifi c—sometimes Ahab’s invention, other  times the collaborative work of his unsuspecting crew—more  than any other single factor leads to the American whaler’s  apocalyptic end and to the retaliatory opening of Japan that,  history informs us, will be carried out in its wake. Moby-Dick’s  critique of America hinges upon the manufacture and com- mensurability of two distinct terrors. First, a terror originates on  board the Pequod that helps constitute the “indissoluble league”  that obliges all crew members to carry out Ahab’s monomania- cal will, even in violation of their own self-interest (Moby-Dick,  p. 166). Second, a terror is projected outward onto some oth- erwise desirable externality, in order to justify the subsequent  intrusion into and reorganization of a newly irrationalized ter- ritory. Grounded in the rhetoric of Christianity and commerce,  each of these terrors has the effect of replacing cultural rela- tivism with moral absolutism. They are, of course, constitutive  of one another; they are codependent fantasies rooted in the  same desires and fears. Ahab’s “phantom limb” is not quite Adam Smith’s “invis- ible hand,” and yet, against what Donald Pease calls Starbuck’s  C4746.indb   488 3/19/08   6:55:46 AM </page> <page sequence="25"> melville’s japan 489 “marketplace religion” (one that determines “just action” ac- cording the Nantucket system of public ownership and a pre- determined hierarchy of “lays” for the crew), Ahab aims to  individualize profi t motive by transcending the concerns of in- vestment, dividend, and welfare, as such. (Of course, he does  this purely for personal gain and not for the collective benefi t of  the community or crew.) Comparing his own mission to that of  the Christian crusaders, Ahab surmises: “Had they been strictly  held to their one fi nal and romantic object—that fi nal and ro- mantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust”  (Moby-Dick, p. 212). To assuage his own crew’s appetite for pal- pable things, Ahab again turns to the gold doubloon, the same  talisman that drove Americans west to the gold fi elds of Cali- fornia. “They may scorn cash now,” he reasons, “but let some  months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and  then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them,  this same cash would soon cashier Ahab” (pp. 212–13). The  coin’s appearance ensures that the cooperative sense of labor  that joins the crew together, along with the community-based  economic program that binds the Pequod to the Nantucket own- ers and investors, no longer holds any sway. The allure of communal labor is surprisingly strong in these  men, at times overpowering the end goal of the labor itself. The  homoerotic orgy of spermaceti-squeezing momentarily allows  Ishmael to forget all about the Pequod crew’s “horrible oath” to  expunge the white whale from the sea (Moby-Dick, p. 416). He  soon realizes, however, that not only are such moments of tran- scendence always fl eeting, but they are imminently dangerous  as well; for the residue of their awesome feeling is always then  projected back onto “the wife, the heart, the bed, the table,  the saddle, the fi re-side, the country” (p. 416). Ahab, too, is  acutely aware of this tendency for all-powerful feelings to fi nd  their home elsewhere, and the strength of his pact is predi- cated on the projection of terror away from himself and onto  the white whale. Ahab has been maddened, he insists, only be- cause Moby Dick is mad. In order to reconstitute the crew’s bond in the language  of his own cause, Ahab universalizes the terror that motivates  his own vengeance, in effect making his personal notion of  C4746.indb   489 3/19/08   6:55:46 AM </page> <page sequence="26"> 490 nineteenth-century literature good and evil accessible to Christians and pagans alike. During  a black mass, or mock jeremiad, he orders the crew to “drink  and swear . . . Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not  hunt Moby Dick to his death!” (Moby-Dick, p. 166). Here Ahab’s  own dismemberment becomes an occasion to forge a new, multi- national alliance predicated on a “wild, mystical, sympathetical  feeling” that causes Ishmael’s shouts to go up with the rest of  the crew and to weld his oath to theirs (p. 179). Having attained  the endorsement not only of Ishmael but also of Tashtego,  Daggoo, and Queequeg (the three harpooners who stand in  for all races), Ahab’s pursuit of the whale is thus fi nalized as a  capitalist-disguised journey to confront an ultimate romantic  ideal. This utopian ideal turns out to be not so different from  Seward’s romanticized vision of the Pacifi c as a reservoir for in- cestuous commerce between the newly reunited races of man. The subsequent apocalyptic dismantling of the Pequod  does not give Moby-Dick its would-be righteous moral; instead,  it sullies it. For it is precisely this sort of confrontation between  American whalers and some unknown and impenetrable force  in the waters off Japan that authorized Seward to survey the  Pacifi c in the fi rst place, and that provided Perry with a popular  rationale to exact revenge upon the Japanese for their treat- ment of the Lagoda crew. Couched within a national economic  and religious ethos, Seward’s speech before Congress masks  the insidious necessity of mapmaking to the manufacture of  empire; not simply as the rhetorical means by which the U.S.  Navy might ostensibly enter Japanese waters, or merely as the  pictorial evidence of America’s providential import of God and  gold to the Pacifi c, but, fi nally, as a way to outline in advance a  utopian set of expectations about how the world will turn out to  look and feel. In this way, Seward’s faith in the ability of maps to  predict future reality renders radical Ishmael’s own contraposi- tive insistence that Queequeg’s native land, “an island far away  to the West and South,” “is not down in any map; true places  never are” (Moby-Dick, p. 55). Although Ishmael may correctly identify the danger at- tending Seward’s mapmaking campaign—namely, that empires  have the ability to rewrite histories and eradicate the collective  memories of peoples, but can equally project their totalizing  C4746.indb   490 3/19/08   6:55:47 AM </page> <page sequence="27"> melville’s japan 491 designs into the outward future via maps and travelogues— Melville recognizes that Moby-Dick likewise runs the risk of par- ticipating in this same collective fantasy. The mere spectacle of  nationalized vanquishment, even though emptied of meaning,  has the potential to overshadow the cautionary message it is in- tended to evoke. Just as Ahab revisits Japan in order to confront  the whale yet again, so too does Melville return to the spot of  his earlier literary invention—not to validate Ahab’s ambition,  of course, but to oppose it.41 By transforming his own anti-mis- sionary message in Typee into Ahab’s even more vitriolic hunt  against the veiled Christ himself, Melville incriminates the pro- cess by which the purportedly humane documentation of “true  places” gives way to their allegorization. In this way, Ishmael  helps to identify the white whale as an exotic terror worthy of  the West’s attention, only to fi nd his methodical extraction of  its essence made fodder for an international conspiracy to force  trade upon Japan. Why then—against the marked presence of Seward, Perry,  Melville, Ahab—does Ishmael disappear from the latter third  of his own narrative, only to reappear in the epilogue, after “the  drama’s done” (Moby-Dick, p. 573)? It is because Melville, better  than any writer of the American Pacifi c, understands the way  in which personal narratives (merchant, missionary, or other- wise) become emblematic of national, or even international,  fantasies, but also the degree to which these national stories,  in turn, overwhelm and consume the individuals involved. The  disa ppearance of Ishmael in Moby-Dick signals the very real fail- ure of the evanescent intellectual to control the function of his  own ideas in the marketplace religion of terror. His orphaned  return, as Ishmael, only implicates him further in that failure. University of California, Irvine 41 In a letter written to Nathaniel Hawthorne in June 1851, deep in the throes of  Moby-Dick, Melville famously declared: “From my twenty-fi fth year I date my life. Three  weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded  within myself” (Herman Melville, letter to Nathaniel Hawthorne, [1 June?] 1851, in  his Correspondence, ed. Lynn Horth, vol. 14 of The Writings of Herman Melville [Evanston  and Chicago: Northwestern Univ. Press and The Newberry Library, 1993], p. 193).  That process of unfolding clearly began with Typee.

Historical studies of Commodore Matthew C. Perry’s forced  “opening” of Japan to trade with the West tend to ignore the ways in which Perry’s  campaign itself served as a supplement to violence rather than a circumvention of it.  Perry’s gunboat diplomacy was informed by two strands of American exceptionalist dis- course elsewhere popularized by William H. Seward: the democratization of the globe  through commerce and the providential duty to bring Christianity to the barbarians.  Seward insisted that the Americanization of the Pacifi c would unify East and West in  contradistinction to the defaced Atlantic world. In Moby-Dick (1851) Ahab inverts these  arguments; he rhetorically confl ates the white whale and Japan as the twinned nemeses  of American commercial interests in the Pacifi c. By convincing the crew to forgo the  Pequod’s contracted whaling mission in favor of a romanticized geopolitical revenge  plot, Ahab confronts the spectral trace of Western capitalism’s origin—the white whale  as commodity’s cipher. The manufacture and marketability of terror in the Pacifi c,  Melville concludes, incites the Pequod’s demise off the coast of Japan, and further  evidences the failure of American ambition to prescribe its own limits.
