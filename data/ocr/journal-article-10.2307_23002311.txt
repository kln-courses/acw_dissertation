<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Sudhir Kakar, The Inner World Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1980, 188 pages, Rs 50 As a 'Psycho-analytic study of childhood and Society in India', this book is an original approach to understanding the complex Indian ethos in a many levelled society, since in the words of the author, his book is a 'journey into Indian childhood to discover the sources of Indian identity'. Inevitably, it is actually a discovery of Hindu identity, which itself was a major enterprise. The use of the word Indian for Hindu, though explain ed, is somewhat misleading throughout the text since the word 'Indian' for many Indians is not synonymous with Hindu, though to countless Hindus it undoubtedly is. What makes this book of special interest is the author's intimate know ledge of western psycho-analytic systems and his close examination of Indian anthropology, mythology, folk tales, sociological studies and clinical observations in India itself to explain some of Hinduism's basic concepts. These interact on a person's 'feelings, impulses, wishes and fantasies ... the dynamic content of the inner world . . . occupying the deepest reaches of the psyche'. The chapter on the 'Hindu World Image' is a deeply reasoned examination of a subject full of pitfalls, since it seeks to interpret (but does so remarkably successfully) concepts like moksha, vidya and avidya, maya, chitta, etc., in modem scientific terms. That these terms have themselves been largely derived from Western sources, makes the book important as a bridge between cultures and a source of clearer understanding of concepts and attitudes which have so far been obscure. For instance, a passage like this one: 'The presence of the guru to guide and monitor, "know the I" is essential. But the guru's function is not to help to strengthen the ego's autonomy or to enlarge its domain through insights into the hidden reaches of the mind. Rather, given the goal of calming "chitta" and the gradual merging of the ego and the (transformed) id, the guru's role in pratyahara is to sanction and facilitate this process of integration while all the while keeping a watchful eye on the "patient's" ego lest it be prematurely engulfed. The presence of the guru provides the necessary support against the danger of psychotic breakdown. Unlike the alert, sanctioning support conveyed in words in most western psycho-thera pies, the guru's support is given through "look, touch and silence .. . the language of the chitta". This is an intimate and personal approach.' 121</page><page sequence="2">122 TARA ALI BAIG This deeply personalized relationship between guru and seeker is in a certain sense a mother-child dependence role as an adult transference syndrome, which is examined in great detail later in the book The guru represents the power to transcend 'self'. To the reviewer this would appear to be a better protection against breakdown than freudian analysis which seeks to discover the roots of psychosis, a process which in many patients, causes weakening of the ego, without the countervailing support needed to assume a stronger indentity. According to the experts, fear in psycho analysis is determined by two inescapable facts of life: human imagination and dependence. However, it is how these interact in childhood from the earliest years that a pattern of personality emerges into adulthood, shaped as it is by myriad other influences. In India, with caste, clan and joint family, the influences are more rigid and highly structured. Hindu culture, the author asserts, has consistently emphasized that as long as a person stays true to his ground plan of life and fulfils what society and his family social obligation imposes on his own special life work, he is on the right path for ultimate release represented in the goal of attaining moksha. To find the right path being difficult, Hindu ethic is sufficiently flexible to recognize that right action for the individual depends upon the culture in which he is born and on his own efforts in previous lives. These provide the individual with an innate 'psycho-biological' heritage. The individual in the Hindu life cycle is thus released inwardly from two elements that often inhibit the Western mind. One is responsibility for one's actions, and the other, guilt. To quote the author '. .. a Hindu's actions are governed by a more permissive and gentle, but much more uncertain, thou-canst-but-try precept. One of the psycho-social consequen ces of this culturally sanctioned relativism, or uncertainty, is the generation in the individual Hindu, from the earliest childhood, of a pervasive doubt as to the wisdom or efficacy of individual initiative.' Examination of early childhood influences occupies the major part of the next two chapters in which two observations are of paramount importance: the dominant role of motherhood in India and the bleak transition from mother protection to responsible adult male life for boys. A basic postulate of the Hindu life style is its diverse yet inflexible struc ture which is deeply etched on the Hindu psyche. The basis of ashrama dharma is the clear-cut and widely understood stages of a life-cycle. Though these do not influence all people born into Hinduism, in the collective subconscious these stages are considered desirable from childhood's lenient, permissive disciplines, an adolescent's obedience to solemnity of purpose and strict moral codes of behaviour, a young adult householder's material responsibilities, to the final renunciation of the world and worldly cares in old age. The withdrawal from the world of material needs and duties is supposed to take place gradually leading to total renunciation to the point of real sanyas and wandering in search of the Ultimate. But the seeds of all this are sown by precept and the ritual with</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 123 which Hindu life is interlarded from earliest infancy. Interestingly enough, none of this is imparted by trained preceptors, so much as by women's unique role as progenitors. The impact of such a strongly structured society upon the individual mind is manifest to Indian psycho-therapists in the ready acceptance of many patients of the force of their specific samskaras (their inherited dispositions) product as they are believed to be of many previous lives. Consequently, children are not normally looked upon as clean slates on which the adult can write the lines of future personality, nor are children consciously pressed into a certain mould according to parental will or the culturally approved image. Demand feeding of babies, for instance, was the time honoured method of Indian baby care. It is nothing new in India. Likewise, little disciplina is evident especially in the upbringing of male children, who are generally pampered and indulged. If disciplines in childhood existed at all, it related to girls who were early taught their nurturing role and the principles of service—seva—with its concommitant role of denial of the self. But for both boys and girls, infancy is the foundation for later psychological experience and the nature of the child's first relationship with the mother profoundly influences the quality of social relationships throughout life, a fact, which the author stresses, has received recognition only relatively recently. His analysis of the infant-mother relationship in the Indian social context is thus of considerable significance and he goes on to examine in some detail its impact upon man and society as a whole. For the Indian woman, motherhood confers upon her a purpose and identity that is probably unique in any culture, and being mother of a son, a source of social redemption. Equality with man is consequently seldom the desirable goal, so much as fulfilment of society's expectations and the honour this brings. If anthropological accounts are apparently explicit with regard to the development of boys and scanty in their treatment of girls, it may well be that these were patriarchal norms absorbed by the non-Aryan populations after the Aryan invasions. What has not been stated anywhere in the book, however, is the absolutely unique character of Hindu culture. This was a patriarchal structure imposed upon a matriarchal one over a period of some hundreds of years. However, since it is women who are the prime agents responsible right up to the present times for family rejoicing when a son is born and the family grief on the birth of a daughter the pampering of the sons and making them dependent for all their material needs on the women of the family, might well indicate that by this device, women have dominated and controlled family life though not appearing to do so by any overt injury to the male ego. In fact, 'given the. experience of his mother's immediacy and utter respon siveness, an Indian generally emerges from infancy into childhood with a staunch belief that the world is benign and that others can be counted on to act in his behalf. The young child has come to experience</page><page sequence="4">124 TARA ALI BAIG his core self as lovable: "I am lovable, for I am loved". Infancy has provided him with a secure base from which to explore his environment with confidence. This confidence in the support and protection of others, together with the vivid memory traces of material ministrations, provide the basic modality for his social relations throughout the life cycle. In other words, Indians are apt to approach others with an unconscious sense of their own lovability and the expectation that trustworthy benefactors will always turn up at times of difficulty. Suspicion and reserve are rare. Many character traits ascribed to Indians are a part of the legacy of this particular pattern of infancy: trusting friendliness with a quick readiness to form attachments and intense, if short-lived, disappointment if friendly overtures are not reciprocated; willingness to reveal the most intimate confidences about one's life at the slightest acquaintance and the expectation of a reciprocal familiarity in others; and the assumption that it is "natural both to take care of others . . . and to expect to be cared for". Considering the oppressive economic environments in which Indians live, I find no other explana tion than the emotional capital built up during infancy for the warmth that is abundantly and unreservedly given and received in the most casual encounters, for the bouts of spontaneous laughter (and crying), and for the glow of intimacy and vitality that characterizes social relations in India.' This quotation leads to another important point borne out with reference to popular novels and other pertinent examples given in the book, of the yearning for the confirming presence of the loved one (mother) and the distress aroused by the condition of being abandoned on one's own. The conclusion that Indians characteristically rely upon the support of others to go through life and to deal with exigencies imposed by the outside world, underlines the whole concept of the power of a personal leadership factor in political life or of gurus in religious life. Both are honoured and revered in a manner not given to scientists, scholars, industrial magnates or the economically powerful. The matrix for this latent dependence especially of the Indian male may stem not only from the protracted nurturing role of mothers, but also the joint family system which dominates the formative years of life of most adults. Here, to quote the author, 'traditionally, in the early years the mother continues to serve as the child's ego, mediating his most elemen tary experiences, well into the years of childhood proper, until around the age of four. The ego's responsibility for monitoring and integrating reality is then transferred from the mother to the family at large and other social institutions.' The patterns of these interrelationships and inherent attitudes in turn create the hierarchical ordering later of social dependencies visible in all walks of life. Rebirth and second birth are then examined, terms that are frequently misrepresented, especially abroad, but in the chapter 'Families and Children' it is stated that 'in the psycho-social sense, the world of Indian</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 125 childhood widens suddenly from the intimate cccoon of maternal protec tion to the unfamiliar masculine network woven by the demands and tensions, the comings and goings of ihe men of the family.' In his opinion this sudden transition, representing a reversal of everything expected of him, causes grave trauma to many men who continue to seek protective mother love and care and are lost in this 'second birth'. Philosophers, however, would probably place a different meaning on second birth, terming it the period when the individual can cast off the habit patterns firmly fixed in the psyche by birth and environment, and the disciplines and prejudices imposed upon his personality, and discover his true self. The chapter 'Tracings: The Inner World in Culture and History' is both less concise than the rest of the book and does not convincingly contribute to the basic thesis. If anything, it provides a series of studies from religious belief of the type of influence that has affected Hindu personality from a variety of sources. Romain Rolland wrote a far deeper analysis of the anthropomorphic aspects of the divine which, for instance, linked the thought of Sri Ramakrishna with the modernism of Swami Vivekananda. The purpose of the somewhat long dissertation on Swami Vivekananda would appear to be to give an example of socially acceptable means of reconciling ancient Hindu belief and ways with the pressing exigencies of development. Acceptance is inherent in any process of social change. Change itself, however, often causes undue disturbance in Indian society, inspite of the fact that radical change is inexorably taking place all the time. Quoting Vivekananda, 'where God is worshipped as Mother, the Hindus call such worship the "right hand way": and it leads to spirituality, but never to material prosperity. When God is worshipped in His terrible aspect (as the father?) that is in the "left hand way". It usually leads to great material prosperity, but rarely to spirituality, and eventually it leads to degeneration and the obliteration of the race that practises it.' This is the basic dilemma of Hindu society, explaining as it does the extremes of doctrine, policy and individual fads of leaders that are the leitmotiv of our times. The author pleads for a holistic approach to man's nature, but in the light of his own thesis, will this be possible in India? New Delhi Tara Ali Baig</page></plain_text>
