<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES AND ITS SYSTEMATIC PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY DOZENT DR. PHIL. S. ATLAS MOSES MAIMONIDES, born March 30, II35, the eight hundredth anniversary of whose birth we now commemorate, is one of those universal spirits who mastered the whole realm of knowledge of their time. His fruitful and extensive literary activity covered many fields: astronomy, medicine, Talmud, and philosophy. His works on medicine were in former times highly esteemed. In the field of philosophy he strove for the synthesis of Aristotelianism and revealed religion, an endeavour which was of paramount importance for the later development of philosophic thought. His influence as a philo- sopher is not confined to the sphere of Jewish thought, but has left a lasting impression on the history of philosophy in general. In his chief philosophical work, Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides set himself the task-as the name of the book indicates-of being a guide for those who are perplexed by the problem of recon- ciling philosophy with biblical religion. He sought to harmonize religion and philosophy and to resolve the apparent contradictions between the two spheres. He pursued this task of reconciliation not on the basis of the admission of two distinct spheres having different aims and purposes whose limits were to be defined and adjusted, but on that of the recognition of their essential unity. Metaphysical truth and religious truth, he claims, are not two different kinds of truth but the true concepts of religion and philosophy are identical. Real religious belief is also knowledge, whereas faith if it is not at the same time a form of knowledge is valueless. This intellectualism leads Maimonides to declare the knowledge of God and the World to be the most sublime ethical task of man. For only through know- ledge does man come nearer to God. True religion and philosophy have the same task and pursue the same aim, namely, to enable man to participate in the eternal through the knowledge of God. For immortality, the participation in the Divine, man achieves only through knowledge of God and of the universe. Thus, the acquiring of knowledge becomes the ultimate ethical task to which all other tasks of man are subordinated, and the supreme value to which all other values are merely subsidiary.

On the other hand, in studying the Scriptures, what we shall find in them is to be determined by our own reason. Reason is the ultimate judge in matters of truth, and what reason declares to be untrue cannot be made the content of faith. Since reason compels us to apprehend the concept of the unity of God in such a way as to exclude every multiplicity of positive qualities and attributes, for His unity is an absolutely simple one, therefore the anthropomorphic passages in Scriptures have to be so explained that they can be harmonized with the concept of unity as taught by philosophy. Now at the point where Maimonides departed from the basis of Aristotelian philosophy, namely in the problem of Creation, he said that it was not Scripture which compelled him to maintain the thesis of creation out of nothing; for, if reason should compel him to accept the Aristotelian doctrie of the eternity of the world, he would interpret the passages in the Bible in such a way as to harmon- ize them with reason. On the question of Creation, however, reason, which is the only determining factor, does not give a definite answer; therefore we can accept the literal sense of the Scriptures. The relation between philosophy and theology, according to Maimonides, can best be expressed by a picture which Kant used. In view of the well-known saying that "philosophy is the handmaid of theology," Kant said: "It can be admitted, but we have to put the question for consideration, whether she is a handmaid who follows bearing the train of her mistress or whether she goes before bearing a torch to illumine her path." By raising knowledge to the position of the sublime ethical task of man and by subordinating faith to knowledge, Maimonides has thus declared philosophy to be the handmaid which is bearing the torchlight of reason to illumine the way of religion. By philosophy, the contents of which Maimonides holds to be identical with the true concept of religion, he means the philosophy of Aristotle. Since Aristotelian philosophy contains principles which are at variance with the teachings of revealed religion, Maimonides was compelled to examine the Aristotelian system and to reconstitute it to bring it into harmony with the teachings of religion. He accepted those Aristotelian principles which seemed to him to be necessary logically. Maimonides' concept of God as prima causa as well as the proofs for the existence of God are all Aristotelian. On the basis of the movement of the world which cannot be infinite he proceeds to the idea of God as first unmoved mover. It was the method of the 6I</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY Mutakallimun, the school of Arabic theology, to prove the existence of the world in time, that is to say that the world was created, from which follows the existence of God as creator. Unlike the Mutakal- 'imun, Maimonides proceeds to prove the existence of God quite independently of the question as to whether the world is eternal or exists in time. Following the proofs of the existence of God on the presupposition of the eternity of the world Maimonides examined closely the Aristotelian proofs of the eternity of the world and found them inconclusive. The problem of creation was the centre of philosophical interest and was the principal matter of controversy between the followers of Aristotle and Mutakallimun, the Arabic theologians. Whilst the philosophers taught the eternity of the world, that there is only a relative and not an absolute becoming, the theologians on the other hand regarded creation out of nothing as an irrefutable principle of belief. As Maimonides set himself the task of harmonizing the philosophy of Aristotle with revealed religion, he solved the problem by lifting the whole question on to a different plane. By reason alone, it is impossible to prove apodictically the creation of the world, as claimed by the Mutakallimun, and it is no less impossible to prove the opposite Aristotelian doctrine that the world is eternal. So, as reason is inadequate to solve the problem, it can be left to revelation to provide the solution. If the proofs for the eternity of the world were conclusive, it would be necessary to interpret the biblical passages relating to creation accordingly, for revelation cannot be contrary 'to reason. Consequently, the creation of the world must be made probable in the light of reason, in which case revelation can then be shown not to be contrary to reason. The arguments for the eternity of the world advanced by Aristotle and his followers, Maimonides classified into those based upon a scientific knowledge of nature and those which have the concept of God as their starting-point. To the first class belongs, for instance, the argument from movement. It is impossible to maintain that the phenomenon of movement had a beginning in time, for the supposi- tion of a temporal beginning of movement involves a transition from potentiality to actuality, which is itself movement. Such an hypothesis gives rise to a process of infinite regression, without actually reaching an absolutely first movement. Likewise, matter as a result of an act of creation, presupposes the existence of other matter from which it could be formed, since matter is an indispensable condition of all physical becoming. The proofs for the eternity of the world which are based on the 62</page><page sequence="4">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES knowledge of nature, Maimonides rejected by maintaining that it is impossible to argue from the process of becoming exemplified in a part of nature to the origin of the world as a whole. The creation of the world cannot be refuted on the basis of knowledge of nature, in which there can be no becoming without previous being, since the origin of the world as a whole is beyond the limits of given nature and therefore beyond the sphere of knowledge. He admits that there is no creatio ex nihilo in the realm of natural phenomena, but it does not necessarily follow from this that the origin of the universe may not be due to a creative act of God. The mistake which underlies all these proofs consists in the confusion of the process of becoming as experienced in the world with the origin of the world in toto which is beyond the realm of experience. It is the same mistake into which one would fall by deducing the conditions of embryonic life from the circumstances of adult existence. The proofs for the eternity of the world, which have the idea of God as their starting-point, and which Maimonides rejected, can be summarized briefly as follows: creation out of nothing by God cannot be maintained, for the reason that it would imply that God had passed by the act of creation from a state of potentiality to that of actuality, and such change of state could only be brought about by another agent. Likewise, it cannot be maintained that God is active at one time and inactive at another, since He is not subject to accidents which could affect His will. Maimonides rejected these propositions by pointing out the under- lying mistake involved in confusing human will and action with the will of God and a divine creative act. Human will is subject to deter- mining conditions, and human creative action involves a transition from potentiality into actuality, whereas God's will and creative power are entirely distinct from man's and have only the name in common. It is thus impossible to infer from the nature of a human creative act the nature of a divine creative act, since the two are totally different. Maimonides' repudiation of these proofs for the eternity of the world is bound up with his theory of the negative attributes of God, since the distinctiveness of divine and human will, precluding the possibility of inferring the nature of the former from the latter, has its roots in his thesis that the divine attributes cannot be defined positively. The objective of the arguments of Maimonides in regard to the creation of the world is only to show its acceptability, for theoretically the creation of the world can no more be proved than its eternity. Decisive for the supposition of the creation of the world is the religious purpose, which demands a supernatural creative God. For the contrary idea, that of eternity, involves the concept of God, 63</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY not as a free creative spirit, but only as a necessary producing cause. If the creation of the world is accepted as a logical impossibility, this would imply that the whole of nature is a necessity; and man, being a part of nature, can possess no free creative personality. The acceptance of the eternity of the world would destroy the moral factor in the concept of God. A God which is a necessary producing cause, cannot be an ideal for morality. The principle of Assimilatio Dei, that God is an ethical ideal, is so central in the Maimonidean conception of God, that from this follows the demand for the creation of the world. In this problem of creatio ex nihilo, Maimonides followed a course similar to the critical method of Kant. He does not try to prove the creation of the world in opposition to Aristotle in order to give a basis for faith, as was the case with the Arabic Kalam. He tries only to disprove the eternity of the world. He has thus transferred the problem of creatio ex nihilo from the sphere of theoretical know- ledge to the sphere of faith, of practical ethics. On the question of creatio ex nihilo Maimonides' method comes very near to that of Kant in regard to the proofs of the existence of God. The divergence of Maimonides from the Aristotelian basis at this point involved not only the question of creation and eternity, but also the concept of God and the concept of Man. According to Aristotle, God is not a free creator, but is Himself subject to the force of necessity. Likewise, the validity of the principle of causality in the world, which has its origin in God as prima causa, is absolute and unlimited. Thus the world does not possess a creative character; and man, as part of the world, is subject to the same principle and cannot be free in his actions. Maimonides, on the contrary, in maintaining the thesis of the creation of the world out of nothing, apprehended the concept of God in a fundamentally different manner from Aristotle, in that he conceived God as an absolutely free creator, thus giving to the world a creative character and regarding man as a free creative personality. There is thus a correspondence between the concept of God and the idea of man, and both find expression in the same attitude towards the problem of creation. The points upon which Maimonides differs from Aristotle are of such far-reaching significance that one is led to challenge the generally accepted view that Maimonides' system is Aristotelian. Certainly, Maimonides stands on the Aristotelian basis; but the points wherein he deviates from the Aristotelian path are not merely in details, but are so fundamental as to affect his attitude towards the whole system of thought, and the hall-mark of a thinker consists not in what he has in common with others but what is unique to himself. Maimonides' ethical concept of God is clearly expressed in his 64</page><page sequence="6">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES theory of negative attributes. The idea of the absolute unity of God excludes the possibility of ascribing to Him positive attributes, since positive attributes involve a duality of subject and predicate. The only positive attributes which can be ascribed to Him are the ethical ones. The bearing of the theory of negative attributes is much wider than appears at first sight; it pervades the whole system and many problems are solved by Maimonides on the basis of this theory. Every positive description of an object is necessarily either a state- ment of the conditions and causes of which it is a result, or an analysis of the essential elements of which it is composed. The first kind of description can only apply to conditioned objects, i.e. objects whose causes are beyond themselves; while the second type of description refers only to objects composed of a number of different elements. From the idea of the absolute unity of God, and from the concept of God as the unconditional and uncaused, follows as a corollary the impossibility of applying to Him these two forms of description. Since the essence and existence of God are identical, and His being is a necessary existence, whereas all other beings are conditioned, and their existence can only be regarded as possible existence, it is impossible to apply to God any definition which involves a relation between Him and other beings, for relationship can only obtain between things which have something in common. All attributes which can be applied to God must, therefore, have only a negative character. That is, they express a negation of imper- fection, e.g. the attribute of omniscience means a negation of ignor- ance; omnipotence is a negation of impotence; eternity is a negation of cause and of conditions. Every attribute which ascribes to God a perfect quality can only be expressed in a negative form, in which any comparison in respect of such qualities between Him and other beings is excluded. For, ascribing omniscience in a positive sense would imply that His knowledge is of the same kind as the knowledge of man; and this would involve limitation. Only when the attribute is understood in a negative sense, e.g. that omniscience is negation of ignorance, is the knowledge of God expressed in the highest degree, without limitation. The real reason for ascribing negative attributes to God is to express His infinite perfection, without endangering the concept of absolute unity, and the idea of the Divine perfection is attained by means of the denial of imperfection. The only positive attributes which can be ascribed to God are ethical attributes, which refer not to His essence but to His actions; and the idea of absolute unity is thus not endangered. These ethical attributes imply the idea of God as a symbol to man of ethical perfection. Accordingly, the ex- pressions in the Bible must be explained either as negative or as ethical attributes. 65 E</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY By the negative definition of the knowledge of God, Maimonides overcomes the difficulty in regard to the problem of the freedom of the human will. In contradistinction to modern philosophy, where the problem of free-will consists in its involving infringement of causality; in the Middle Ages the question of free-will was considered in connection with the idea of the absolute knowledge of God, which includes fore-knowledge. In modern times, the problem is postulated: how is freedom of action possible if the validity of the principle of causality is absolute? In the Middle Ages, the problem took the form: how can freedom of will be harmonized with the absolute knowledge of God, since this includes fore-knowledge of the future? Maimonides countered the problem by stating that the knowledge of God is absolutely distinct from human knowledge in that it can only be defined negatively. Fore-knowledge would exclude freedom of will only if knowledge is defined positively; as divine knowledge in contradistinction to human knowledge is defined negatively, then the question, "How can freedom of will and the fore-knowledge of God be harmonized," is unjustified? The idea of the absolute unity of God, with the consequent exclu- sion of every positive definition, is a neo-platonic one. Maimonides utilized it to elaborate his ethical concept of God which is the ultimate aim of his philosophy. The neo-platonic conception of God can be regarded as leading to the ethical concept of God, which is manifest in Maimonides' doctrine that the only positive attributes to be ascribed to God are ethical ones, and which shows itself in many other points of his system.i As a necessary consequence of his theory of negative attributes, it follows that our knowledge of God is confined to His ethical attributes only, to His actions, not His essence. Any metaphysical knowledge of His being is impossible. And in the scale of values which he established in accordance with Aristotle, he subordinated ethical perfection to contemplative, since the highest value for man is knowledge of God and the universe. The faculty of pure thinking and contemplation constitutes the essence of man which places him above all other beings. All the same, knowledge of God means knowledge of His ethical attributes, and this involves the idea of God as an ethical symbol for man and the moral command to man to follow God in His creative work. Thus the highest value of know- ledge of God turns out to imply a moral imperative commanding assimilatio dei-a striving to approximate to the moral idea symbol- ized in the idea of God, an imperative to become a co-creator and co-operator with God. In denying the possibility of metaphysical knowledge of God Maimonides set limits to the validity of human reason. Maimonides, 1 cf. Julius Guttmann: Die Philosophie des Iudenthvms. Miinchen, T933, p. 185. 66</page><page sequence="8">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES with all his belief in human reason, is conscious of its limitations, and always maintains a critical attitude towards it. The validity of human reason refers only to knowledge of the sublunar world. Whhatever transcends the sublunar world is beyond the realm of knowledge. There are problems for which human reason is inadequate. Just as the metaphysical essence of God cannot become an object of knowledge, and the problem of the eternity or the creation of the world passes human comprehension; so, too, the ultimate purpose of the universe as a whole is a metaphysical problem which cannot be scientifically approached. In this delineation of the realm of knowledge and the realm of transcendence which is beyond knowledge, is manifest that critical attitude which relates Maimonides to the critical philosophy of modern times. In accordance with Aristotle, Maimonides teaches that the principle of purpose governs all phenomena. All phenomena have to be teleologically explained. This is the object of natural science, to find out the final cause of everything, which is the most important of the four causes. But it is impossible to explain teleologically the universe as a whole. For Aristotle, who considered the world not as the product of a creative act of God, but as a necessary effect of the existence of God, the question of its purpose cannot arise. On the other hand, those who taught the creation of the world found it necessary to explain its purpose. They therefore considered man the purpose of creation. Maimonides rejected this theory and maintained that the teleological principle has its application immanently to all worldly phenomena but not transcendentally to the cosmos as a whole. The question of the purpose of the world is, by its very essence, unanswerable, for if we take man as the final purpose of creation, then the question remains, "What is the purpose of man?" and so, necessarily, we continue ad infinitum. Thus the question of the final purpose of creation belongs to those metaphysical problems which cannot be solved on a scientific basis. By denying the possibility of determining the purpose of the universe, Maimonides is far in advance of his time. In general, the geocentric conception of the world leads to the anthropocentric con- ception of man as the purpose of the universe. Maimonides, by opposing this view and by maintaining that the question of the ultimate purpose of creation cannot be scientifically approached, anticipated the conception of Descartes, who centuries later denied the possibility of apprehending the purpose of creation and con- sidered it presumptuous to seek to understand God's design. (Meditationes de primd philosophia, med. IV.) The main problems with which the age of Maimonides was con- cerned were: God and the world, God and man, and God and revela- 67</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY tion. The first of these problems was: How is creatio ex nihilo possible, since creation out of nothing seems to be contrary to the idea of God's all-perfection? The next problem was: How is human free- will possible, in view of the fore-knowledge of God? And the third problem concerned itself with the possibility of revelation. Maimonides attempted to find a solution to all these problems which would at the same time be acceptable both from a religious and from a philosophical point of view. Concerning the first problem, his position is opposed to that of Aristotle who applied the principle of necessity to the world as a whole and considered the world as eternal. Similarly, Maimonides rejected the theory of the Mutakal- limum who held that the divine act of creation is an eternal process and accordingly denied the existence of natural law. Maimonides, while maintaining the existence of natural law, regarded the universe as a whole as having its origin in a free creative act of God. The principle of necessity which prevails in nature is not applicable to the universe in toto. By his conception of God as a free creator and not as an absolutely quiescent being, together with his doctrine of the negative attributes, Maimonides brought to fullest expression his ethical concept of God. He thus invests the universe with a creative aspect and conceives of God as a symbol of man's ethical perfection. And here too is found the basis of the freedom of the human will. Without freedom of will there can be no morality, for true morality implies independent creation. The attribute of God's omniscience, which involves fore-knowledge, does not exclude human freedom of choice, since omniscience is not to be defined positively but negatively as a denial of ignorance. Further, revelation is not to be considered as an infringement by God of natural law. Prophecy, like all phenomena in nature, is subject to the laws prevailing in nature, since it is dependent on ethical and intellectual perfection, without which prophecy would be impossible. On the other hand, prophecy is not merely a natural phenomenon which must necessarily appear when certain pre-conditions are satisfied, but is ultimately dependent upon the divine will without which there can be no prophecy. The work of Maimonides exerted a profound influence on general philosophic thought. To men like Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn, Solomon Maimon, and Hermann Cohen, Maimonides' works were the source of inspiration for their independent philosophic thought, although subsequently they went their different ways. The Kantian Solomon Maimon-his surname implies his reverence for Maimonides-never wholly lost touch with the philosophy of Maimonides. Many points can be traced in Solomon Maimon's thought which show his close connection with Maimonides. Hermann Cohen, the founder of the "Marburg School" of Neo-Kantianism, 68</page><page sequence="10">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES loved to emphasize the relation between his own thought and that of Maimonides. In the theory of negative attributes of Maimonides, Cohen saw Kant's ethico-theology which taught the idea of God as bound up not with nature but with ethics. He recognized a spiritual affinity with Maimonides, whose teaching concerning negative attributes and the method of negation leading to the idea of the divine perfection Cohen saw to be closely related to his own "Logik des Ursprungs," i.e. "The Logic of Generation." In both systems it was through the method of negation that all existence was built up. In the case of Maimonides this led to the idea of the all-perfection of God; and in the case of Cohen the method of negation, that is, "the infinitesimal method," aimed at the ordered Cosmos. In his Characteristics of Maimondes' Ethics Cohen tried to interpret the ethics of Maimonides in his own spirit-as the ethics of critical idealism. It is true that some aspects of Cohen's interpreta- tion are not in accordance with Maimonides' actual teaching. Cohen misinterpreted Maimonides' conception of the moral ideal as an infinite process, whereas Maimonides stands upon the Aristotelian basis, the basis of The Mean. All the same, Cohen reached his stand- point through the philosophy of Maimonides, with which critical idealism has much in common. The moral concept of God is funda- mental to both. The significance of Maimonides consists not in the fact that he connected the Aristotelian philosophy as interpreted by the Arabs with revealed religion. His importance consists rather in the way in which he modified the Aristotelian philosophy, and in the original method by which he gave a new validity, in spite of his Aristotelian- ism, to the moral concept of God. The old prophetic idea of God was always breaking through in his thought. In spite of the radical changes in philosophical thought which have occurred since his time, Maimonides, through his original and profound treatment of religious problems, through the infectious enthusiasm of his philo- sophic attitude and through his boundless belief in human reason, has retained his significance even for our time. And even if his work does not have the same paramount significance which it had in former times, it is still important for our own day. The realm of philosophy is unlike the realm of natural science, wherein the new physics has completely superseded the older physics. There are prob- lems in philosophy which are eternal, old yet always new; the forms of the problems may change, the content remains the same. Thus philosophy is different from natural science wherein the history of science does not playso essential a role as does the history of philo- sophy in the sphere of philosophy. Physics, for example, as such, is not connected with the history of physics. But with regard to philosophy, even if it is not to be identified with the history of 69</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPH Y philosophy, still its study is inseparable from that of its history. In philosophy ancient thinkers are constantly awakening to new life, and are freshly interpreted in connection with newly arisen forms of thought. While Aristotelian physics has only an antiquarian value, some aspects of Aristotelian philosophy are represented in current philosophic thought. It is sufficient to indicate that so recent a work as Hans Driesch's Die Philosophie des Organischen is nothing else than a modern version of Aristotelianism. Similarly, Plato has been freshly interpreted and accommodated to new forms of thought. So too, Maimonides' philosophy can be considered and interpreted in connection with the religious and philosophic problems of our own day. As for Maimonides' influence on the history of general philosophy, his theory of creation out of nothing, in particular, has had a profound influence on Christian thought. One of the main issues between philosophy and theology concerned the creation of the world. The Aristotelian proofs of eternity were considered irrefutable. For this reason the Church strongly opposed the Aristotelian system and pro- hibited the study of Aristotelian philosophy. A different attitude was assumed by Maimonides who, while in general agreement with Aristotle, yet disproved the Aristotelian thesis regarding the eternity of the world. Naturally, therefore, the Maimonidean exposition was of particular interest to the Christian world, for it revealed to the scholastics a new method of maintaining the creation of the world on a philosophic basis. Thus, Maimonides in the thirteenth century facilitated the ascendency of Aristotle by removing the obstacle- the thesis of the eternity of the world. Thereby he contributed towards the displacement of Platonism and Neo-Platonism by Aristotelianism in the Christian philosophy of the thirteenth century. The Guide appeared in II90, and early in the thirteenth century it was already known to the Christian world. William of Auvergne, the bishop of Paris, and Alexander of Hales, the English theologian who first introduced Aristotelian philosophy into Christian theology, made diligent use of Maimonides' work. Albertus Magnus, who flourished soon after Maimonides, one of the most significant figures in the Catholic Church, incorporated in his own work complete chapters of the Guide of Rabbi Moyses Aegyptus, as he called Maimonides, and in general made extensive use of Maimonides' work. He thus prepared the way for his pupil Thomas Aquinas, who used Maimonides' work in the construction of one of the most important systems of Catholic thought. While Albertus Magnus was more the compiler, Thomas Aquinas was the creator of a unified complete system of Christian Theology. Accord- ingly Thomas Aquinas not only quotes Maimonides but has assimi- lated his thought into his own system. 70</page><page sequence="12">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES With regard to the far-reaching influence of Maimonides on Ihomas Aquinas, some scholars go so far as to claim that the Guide of Maimonides is the precursor of the Suma of Thomas Aquinas, and in questions concerning the reconciliation of revealed religion and Aristotelian philosophy Thomas Aquinas follows Maimonides as closely as the differences between Judaism and Christianity permitted.1 It must, however, be admitted that there are fundamental differences between Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas. For example, with regard to the problem of creation, Maimonides retains his critical attitude to the bitter end by maintaining that the creation out of nothing can no more be demonstratively proved than can the eternity of the world. His only aim was to show the acceptability to reason of the doctrine of creation out of nothing and thus to show that there is no contradiction between reason and revelation. On the other hand, Thomas Aquinas is dogmatic in his assertion that creation out of nothing can be made evident by means of demonstration. All the same, Thomas Aquinas received from Maimonides the stimulus for the construction of his own views on creation through the latter's disproof of the Aristotelian arguments in favour of eternity. As in the scholastic period Maimonides served chiefly as the pattern for the harmonizing of religion and Aristotelian thought, so in the Renaissance with the decline of Aristotelianism the interest in Maimonides, although naturally diminished, was not effaced. For this period his attraction lay not, as in the preceding period, in his theory of creation, but in his theory of negative attributes, in his thesis that the essence of God cannot be the object of know- ledge and in his interpretation of the biblical figurative expressions. In modern times Leibniz is the principal philosopher who thought Maimonides worthy of study. Leibniz became acquainted with Maimonides' work through the new Latin translation of the Guide by Johannes Buxtorf (printed at Basle in I629). Leibniz used it, quoted from it, and professed great regard for the author. Leibniz introduces his notes2 on the Guide with the following words: "The work of Rabbi Moses Maimonides called The Guide for the Perplexed is pre-eminent and is more philosophical than I I Cf. Emile Saisset, in Revue de Deux Mondes, I862.-Jacob Guttman, Das Verhdltniss des Thomas von A quino zum Judentum und zur jiidischen Litteratur, G6ttingen, I891.-Jacob Guttmann, Der Einfiuss der Maimonideschen Philo- sophie auf das christliche A bendland, in Moses ben Maimon, Gesellschaft zur Forderung der Wissenschaft des Judentums, Leipzig, I908. 2 Published by a French scholar, Foucher de Careil; Leibniz, La Philosophie juive et la caballe, Paris, I86I. 71</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY expected; it merits close attention. He was a man of unusual intellectual power, in philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and finally in biblical exegesis."I Moreover the system of Leibniz bears affinity in several important respects to that of Maimonides. Attempts have been made to trace spiritual relationship between the philosophy of Spinoza and that of Maimonides. While some aspects of Spinoza's system can be best understood on the back- ground of the Guide, yet the contrast between these two thinkers is so fundamental that any effort to bring them close together must necessarily entail a violation of the principles of one or the other. In their conception of God as well as that of the world they differ fundamentally. While Maimonides presents an ethical Monotheism, Spinoza develops a natural Pantheism. Maimonides' theory of nega- tive attributes leads to the ethical concept of God; Spinoza's theory that the world consists of two positive attributes of God-res extensa and res cogitans-and that the world as a whole is a manifestation of the Divine substance leads consistently to the annihilation of ethics. According to Spinoza the world exists necessarily as a constituent part of God, while according to Maimonides the existence of the world only follows as a product of a free creative act of God. According to Spinoza the validity of the principle of causality is absolute and all-embracing; everything that exists, does so of necessity. There is no freedom of human will which is the essential presupposition of ethics. In a world-order like this man as a part of nature is subject to the same laws which govern the rest of nature. He has no specific place in the cosmos. On the other hand, Maimonides, by his conception of God as a free creator and as a moral symbol to man, has assigned to man a pre-eminent place in the cosmos, and by recognizing him as a free creative personality has invested him with a significance which distinguishes him from all other forms of existence. It seems that of all modern philosophers Leibniz is most akin to Maimonides. Leibniz as well as Maimonides represent the doctrine that the world being the creation of God must be in its essence absolutely good. This idea is based upon the conception, common to both, of God as a perfectly free creative spirit. Leibniz, like Maimonides, conceived of God as an active, dynamic, absolutely free creator in contradistinction to Spinoza, whose conception of God is that of an absolutely static substance. The spiritual affinity of Maimonides and Leibniz can best be traced by comparing Maimon- I Egregium video esse librum rabbi Mosis Maimonidis qui inscribitur Do,tor perplexorum, et magis philosophicum quam putaram, dignum adeo lectione attenta; fuit im philosophia, mathematicis, medica arte, denique sacrae scripturae intelligentia insignis. 72</page><page sequence="14">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES ides' arguments against the Mutakallimun on the question of the existence of natural law and the arguments advanced by Leibniz against "Occasionalism" represented by Malebranche and others. According to the Mutakallimun the world consists of atoms, for the maintenance of which as well as for their coherence continuous re-creation by God is required. There are no natural laws. They conceive of the creative act of God as a continuous one which extends to the minutest details, coming directly from God. They thus present an "Occasionalism" which excludes the existence of natural law. The same "Occasionalism" is manifest in their conception of sub- stance and accident. Substance and atom are identical. The accidents require a continuous re-creation without which no accident could exist for two consecutive moments. As they deny the existence of natural law they conceive of causality not as a law in itself but merely as an habitual sequence. This doctrine of causality as a psychological phenomenon was adopted later by the Arabic philo- sopher Al-Ghazzali, who made it the central point in his system and thus anticipated David Hume's scepticism. It seems that the basis of the "Occasionalism" of the Mutakallimun is to be found in their concept of God as an all-perfect being, in which preference is given to the attribute of omnipotence over that of omniscience. The idea of God as omnipotent involves the suppo- sition that all being and existence are immediately derived from the divine will. Since natural law would limit divine omnipotence the Mutakallimun deny its existence. All existence must therefore be due to a continuous divine creation. Maimonides rejected the doctrine of the Mutakallimun and main- tained the existence of natural law. In the world all phenomena are governed by law established by creation. Maimonides' view of nature being subject to natural law and logic originates in his conception of God as the infinitely perfect being because of His omniscience rather than because of His omnipotence. An ordered cosmos in which law prevails as a manifestation of divine wisdom is more compatible with the idea of divine perfection than a lawless universe in which all phenomena are due to an immediate act of creation as a manifestation of divine omnipotence. Thus the existence of natural law follows from the superior emphasis given to omni- science among the divine attributes. Parallel with Maimonides' arguments against the Mutakallimun are the arguments advanced by Leibniz against "Occasionalism" of his time as represented by Malebranche and others. At the centre of philosophic interest since Descartes stands the problem of mutual interaction and influence on each other of the two absolutely different substances, body and soul. How can two entirely different substances like body, the essence of which is 73</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY extension, and soul, the essence of which is thinking, influence and stimulate each other? The attempt to find a solution to this problem was the determining factor in the development of philosophic thought subsequent to Descartes. In the different answers to this question consists the essence of the philosophic systems of Malebranche, Spinoza, and Leibniz. According to the doctrine of "Occasionalism" the stimulation of the body is only the occasion on which there comes about some modification of the soul, and vice versa. It is only God who finally produces the modification in one substance on the occasion of the stimulation given by another. Thus, the unity of the world is guaranteed by the idea of God, so to say, as a permanent controller connecting the two totally distinct substances, and their influence on each other is due to an immediate act of God. Leibniz expresses the occasionalists' idea of God by means of a simile, comparing God with a supervisor having constantly to adjust two watches to keep them in time with one another. He has constantly to produce the harmony which they are unable to bring about unaided. In like manner, it is the function of God to cause the two totally different substances to correspond with one another. The occasionalists thus give preference to God's attribute of omnipotence. By His constant intrusion into the process of nature, in order to produce the harmony of the two distinct substances, the unity of the world is brought about. Thus the unity of the world is guaranteed by the omnipotence of God. In contradistinction to this is Leibniz's theory of pre-established harmony, which has as its basis the idea of God as all-wise. His doctrine is that at the Creation a harmony was established which ensured the correspondence of the two substances with one another. They can be compared, to follow up Leibniz's simile, with two per- fectly synchronized watches. At the creation of the world, by the wisdom of God, unity was established; and thus, at the creation of the two substances, their harmonious correspondence with one another was provided for. Leibniz considered that this natural harmony of the two substances was more compatible with the idea of God's perfection, than the occasionalists' theory of a supervisor making constant adjustments. Thus in Leibniz's theory of a pre- established harmony, the emphasis is laid on the attribute of omni- science, and this corresponds with Maimonides' view, while the conception of the occasionalists corresponds to that of the Mutakal- limun. It is obvious that within the limits of one lecture it is possible only to call attention to a few points which indicate the systematic place of Maimonides in the history of philosophy and his influence thereon. They may nevertheless suffice to show that the philosophical 74</page><page sequence="16">THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAIMONIDES work of Maimonides, even considered as a product of the culture of his time in the light of which it is to be read and understood, has exerted an influence far beyond his own day; and that his trend of thought shows surprising affinity to modern philosophic ideas. The conviction grows increasingly clear that the realm of spirit stands above nations and races. Great spirits, even though they are closely connected with the general culture of their time and are bound up with the nation of their origin, yet belong to the whole of mankind. Such a one was Maimonides. 75</page></plain_text>
