Sameroff* University of Rochester The concern of developmental psychology is directed toward un derstanding the changes which occur in behavior as the individual grows to maturity. Scientists with a bias for either a maturational or an environmentalist position generally make an implicit assumption that behaviors necessarily build on each other to produce a continuity of functioning from conception to adulthood. The continuity seen in the physical identity of each individual is generalized to the psychological identity of each individual. Just as an individual retains the same body throughout the lifespan, so must he have the same mind. The pragmatic needs of educators, clinicians, and scientists reinforce these views of long-range continuities in human behavior. The need of educators is to feel that the didactic exercises they go through are more than merely exercises and are truly affecting the prospective outcomes of their charges; the need of clinicians is to seek the roots of current deviancy retrospectively in either the experiential or constitutional history of the individual; and the pragmatic need of scientists is to feel that the small piece of the world they are studying really has a relation to the whole of life. However, biologists have shown that physically the body does not maintain a constancy in development. At an elemental level it has long been clear that the material constituents of each organ, tissue, and cell are in constant transition. As a consequence, continuities must be sought in the organization of the body rather than in its ingredients (Bertalanffy, 1968). On a larger time scale it is also clear that the struc ture of the body goes through changes which produce qualitative differences in organization during development (Waddington, 1966). For humans there is an illusion of structural continuity since the major changes occur during the gestational period while the individual is hidden from view.

The increasing sophistication of biological theorizing combined with a series of psychological issues left unresolved by conventional wisdom influenced developmentalists, most notably Piaget (1950) and Werner (1961 ), to reconsider the continuous nature of mental develop ment. Piaget focused on the logic of thought and confronted psychology with a separation between the seeming continuities in performance and dramatic discontinuities in competence. Piaget's stages of cognitive development are based on qualitatively different structural organizations at different points in life. Werner (1957) offers a wider perspective in his concept of the mul tiformity of development. Recognizing the non-specificity of his orthogenetic principle that development moves in the direction of more complex differentiations and integrations, Werner allowed for reaching a particular level of functioning by means of a variety of pathways. In a material vein, modern biological research has demonstrated that the same mature organs can arise from the activities of differing genes, cells, and tissues (Waddington, 1966). A psychological example of "multiformity" of functioning can be found in Goldstein's (1939) ex plorations of the consequences of war injuries to the brain. Not only did identical lesions in different individuals produce different effects, but similar deficits in functioning could also be compensated by a variety of mechanisms. When confronted with evidence or theorizing that continuity may not be central to development, there is a tendency to translate concep tions of discontinuity into more acceptable terms. For example, when Piagetian theory is translated by a normative and achievement oriented Western psychology, the notion that stages are different qualitatively is expanded to include the notion that the better one is at an earlier stage of development the better one will be at the next stage. Thus, the concept of discontinuity in level of competence is reinter preted as a concept of continuity in level of performance. From another perspective Kessen, Haith, &amp; Salapatek (1970) note that despite the minimal evidence for continuities in development, our common-sense view that such stabilities in behavior must exist will provide sufficient basis for the continued search for these continuities. Two points threaten the potential success of this quest. First, the transition from one stage of functioning to another with a qualitatively different level of organization may make many of the adaptations and maladaptations of the earlier stage obsolete, and secondly, individuals with completely different experiential histories can not only achieve these transitions, but also after reaching the new stage show little evidence of the past diversity of functioning. However, before fully elucidating these theoretical points, it is necessary to examine empirically their premise that continuities in development are indeed more apparent than real.</page><page sequence="3">Early Influences on Development The following presentation will consist of four segments. First, we shall examine the influence of a variety of factors which are thought to be related to deviant developmental outcomes in order to seek out linear chains of causality which might provide evidence for continuities in development. Secondly, we shall look at attempts to find continuities in specific classes of behavior such as intelligence and temperament. Thirdly, the suggestion will be made that difficulties in predicting out comes result from utilizing inappropriate models of development. Final ly, we will return to the issue of stages, transitions, and discontinuities with which we began. ORIGINS OF DEVIANCY The influence of psychoanalytic thinking, together with the in creased knowledge of the complexity of behavior found in young children, has raised concerns about the effects of a variety of early trauma on functioning later in life. Continuum of Reproductive Casualty In recent years increasing attention has been directed toward the study and early identification of various factors which place children at a greater than average risk to later disease or disorder. Although per sons of all ages are menaced by a range of life hazards, most of the available research literature has focused on a variety of trauma that are suffered early in infancy and that are expected to play a principal role in the developmental outcome of the affected individual. The seriousness of such early hazards is underscored by the fact that the death rates during the perinatal period are four times greater than those of other ages (Niswander &amp; Gordon, 1972). Of perhaps even greater significance is a broad continuum of reproductive casualty, hypothesized to include congenital malformations, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, deafness, blindness, and other neurosensory defects which are thought to result from early hazards and traumas (Lilienfeld &amp; Parkhurst, 1951;, Lilienfeld, Pasamanick &amp; Rogers, 1955). It has been estimated that approximately 10% of the population in the United States has handicaps or defects that are present at or soon after birth (Niswander &amp; Gordon, 1972). Of the 5-10 million conceptions occurring annually in the United States, 2-3 million result in spontaneous abortions due to genetic or chromosomal defects and pathogens, and another one million are ter minated legally or illegally. Of the approximately 3.5 million fetuses that reach 20 weeks of gestational age, 1.5% die before delivery, 1.5% die in the first postnatal month, 1.5% have severe congenital malfor mations, and about 10% will have learning disorders that range from mild to severe retardation (Babson &amp; Benson, 1971). The large number of general learning disorders and specific deficits in behaviors such as reading are of great concern to clinicians. The lack</page><page sequence="4">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY of either a clear genetic basis or anatomical damage in many children with sensory and behavioral disorders was puzzling to investigators who adhered closely to a traditional "medical model." If, according to this point of view, a disorder existed, there should have been some clear etiological factor, preferably biological, somewhere in the patient's history. If such a factor could not be located, it was presumably because diagnostic techniques were not yet sufficiently sophisticated to detect it. Gesell &amp; Amatruda (1941), strong advocates of such a straightforward cause-effect model, proposed the concept of "minimal cerebral injury" as an explanation. The supposed reason for not being able to document the existence of such injury is because it is, by definition, minimal, i.e., undetectable. Current usage of terms like "minimal brain damage" or "special learning disabilities" are ex pressions of the continuing need for clinicians to be able to explain disorder on the basis of simple cause-effect relationships rather than complex developmental processes. Pasamanick &amp; Knobloch (1966) reviewed a series of retrospective studies which examined the delivery and birth complications of children with a variety of subsequent disorders. They found a number of such later disorders to be significantly associated with greater numbers of complications of pregnancy and prematurity. These includ ed cerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental deficiency, behavior disorders, and reading disabilities. Almost all studies in this area have proceeded on the general assumption that it is possible to specify particular characteristics of either the child or his parents that will permit long range predictions regarding the ultimate course of growth and development. These retrospective studies have implicated a number of factors in early development, such as (1 ) anoxia, (2) prematurity, (3) delivery com plications, and (4) social conditions, as being related to later disorder. After a lengthy review of studies exploring the later effects of perinatal factors Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) were forced to conclude that "even if one continues to believe that a continuum of reproductive casualty exists, its importance pales in comparison to the massive influences of socio-economic factors on both prenatal and postnatal development." Space does not permit a lengthy survey of the evidence for this conclu sion to be made here, but a brief survey of some typical findings will follow. For more detail the reviews of Gottfried (1973) and Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) are recommended. Anoxia It appears logical to assume that cerebral oxygen deprivation early in development would produce later deficits in intellectual functioning. Animal studies seemed to indicate that oxygen deprivation at birth produced brain damage and learning deficits (Windle, 1944). Gottfried (1973) reviewed twenty studies of the effects of perinatal</page><page sequence="5">Early Influences on Development anoxia on later intellectual functioning. His conclusions were quite similar to those arrived at by Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) in their review of the same literature. These findings can be typified by the results of a large longitudinal study carried out in St. Louis. Several hundred infants were seen in the newborn period (Graham, Matarazzo, &amp; Caldwell, 1956), followed up at 3 years (Graham, Ernhart, Thurston, &amp; Craft, 1962), and again at 7 years (Corah, Anthony, Painter, Stern, &amp; Thurston, 1965). As expected, when examined during the first days of life anoxic infants were found to be "impaired" on a series of five measures which included maturation level, visual responsiveness, irritability, muscle tension, and pain threshold (Graham, Pennoyer, Caldwell, Greenman, &amp; Hartman, 1957). When the performance on these measures was compared with scores based on the degree of prenatal anoxia, postnatal anoxia, and the clinical assessment of cen tral nervous system disturbance, those infants with the poorest scores performed most poorly on the newborn assessments. These same in fants were seen again at three years of age and tested with a battery of cognitive, perceptual-motor, personality and neurologic tests (Graham et al., 1962). The group of anoxic infants scored lower than controls on all tests of cognitive function, had more positive neurological findings, and showed some personality differences. At seven years of age these children were again tested (Corah, et al., 1965). Surprisingly, significant IQ differences had disappeared between the anoxic group and the control population. Of the twenty one cognitive and perceptual measures, only two tasks still seemed to show these children deficient. It was concluded that anoxics showed minimal impairment of functioning at seven years and that efforts to predict current functioning on the basis of severity of anoxia were high ly unreliable. To summarize, the St. Louis study showed that anoxic infants did poorly on newborn measures, still showed effects at three years of age, but by seven performed almost as well as non-anoxic con trols. Gottfried (1973) concluded his review by noting that there were many methodological problems in the literature but that anoxic infants as a group do not appear to become retarded. Prematurity Prematurity is another of the classic perinatal hazards that has been related to later deviancy in behavior. Since prematurity is an outcome of many complications in pregnancy and represents the most prevalent abnormality of birth, it may be considered as a modal problem for assessing the effects of the continuum of reproductive casualty (Birch &amp; Gussow, 1970). As in the studies of anoxia, the data on long term effects of prematurity do not lead to any clear cut conclusions. Although many studies of prematurity have found small IQ deficits later in develop ment, it is by no means clear whether these adverse consequences</page><page sequence="6">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY associated with prematurity are a function of the prematurity itself, the accompanying low birth weight, an extended period of living in an in cubator, accompanying perinatal trauma, or the social climate in which the child is raised (Parmelee &amp; Haber, in press). A gestationally premature infant who suffers no prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal traumas other than prematurity itself, and is raised in an optimal home environment may turn out to be no different from a normal full-term infant raised under the same circumstances. It is interesting that the studies of the effects of prematurity have shown consistent, albeit small, IQ deficits, while studies of the effects of anoxia have not. A possible explanation is that the premature infant is more easily recognized and labeled by his parent than the anoxic infant. The parents may not even know if their infant had some form of asphyxia, while the premature, and especially the lower birth weight premature, is quite easily identified not only by its physical appearance but also by the initial separation from the parents, and the subsequent intense caretaking demands. It will be seen that the parents' percep tion of the child can play a major role in its deviant development ex clusive of any actual deficit that may be present in the child. Newborn Status The research literature offers little evidence to suggest a relationship between specific pregnancy and delivery complications and later abnormal behavior. Another source for specific predictions of later deviancy has been aberrations in newborn behavior. Parmelee &amp; Michaelis (1971 ) have provided an excellent review of the relationship between newborn neurological status and later deviancy. Although the diagnostic search for neurological signs was a successful means of identifying infants with contemporary neurological problems, there was little evidence to suggest that such signs were of any utility as predictors of later adaptational problems. Socio-Economic Influences A recurrent theme that has run through much of the research in this area is that social status variables seem to play an important role in modulating the effects of perinatal factors. Birch &amp; Gussow (1970) argued that high risk to infants is associated with depressed social status and ethnicity. The highest rates of infant loss were found among populations which are both poor and black. Pasamanick, Knobloch, &amp; Lilienfeld (1956) found that the proportion of infants having some com plication increased from 5% in the white upper social class stratum, to 15% in the lowest white socio-economic group, to 51 % among all non whites. These data imply that the biological outcomes of pregnancy are worse for those in poorer environments. One of the most ambitious and revealing of the longitudinal studies of the effects of early complications has recently been completed in</page><page sequence="7">Early Influences on Development Hawaii. Werner, Bierman &amp; French (1971 ), reported on all 670 children born on the island of Kauai in 1955. Because of the multiracial nature of Hawaii and the variety of social classes sampled when the whole population was used, Werner et al. were able to provide ample controls for both variables. Each infant was initially scored on a four-point scale for severity of perinatal complications. At twenty months and again at ten years of age, these perinatal scores were related to assessments of physical health, psychological status, and the environmental variables of socio economic status, family stability, and the mother's intelligence. At 20 months of age infants who had suffered severe perinatal stress were found to have lower scores on their assessments. In addi tion, however, there was a clear interaction between the impairing effect of perinatal complications and environmental variables, es pecially socio-economic status. For infants living in a high socio economic environment, with a stable family, or with a mother of high intelligence, the IQ differences between children with and without complication scores was only 5-7 points. For infants living in a low socio-economic environment, with low family stability, or with a mother of low intelligence, the difference in mean Cattell IQs between the high and low perinatal complications groups and between infants without perinatal complications ranged from 19 to 37 points. The results of the Kauai study seem to indicate that perinatal com plications were consistently related to later physical and psychological development only when combined with and supported by persistently poor environmental circumstances. In addition, when good prenatal care is available, socio-economic differences in the initial distribution of perinatal complications were found to disappear. The infants of the Kauai sample were again examined when they reached 10 years of age (Werner, Honzik &amp; Smith, 1968). There was no correlation between the perinatal-stress score and the 10-year measures. Some correlation was, however, found between the 20 month and 10-year data, especially when social-economic status and parents' educational level were taken into consideration. Stability of intellectual functioning was much higher for those children who had IQs below 80 at the 10-year testing. All of these children had 20-month Cattell scores of 100 or less, with almost half below 80. The majority of these children had parents with little education and of low socio economic status. The Kauai study seemed to suggest that risk factors operative during the perinatal period disappear during childhood as more potent familial and social factors exert their influence. Werner and her associates (Werner et al., 1971 ) noted that of every 1000 live births in Kauai, by age 10 only 660 would be adequately functioning in school with no recognized physical, intellectual, or behavior problems. Of the 34% who would have problems at the age of 10 only a minor proportion could be attributed to the effects of serious</page><page sequence="8">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY perinatal stress. The biologically vulnerable child represents only a small proportion of those children who will not function adequately. The authors concluded that in their study "ten times more children had problems related to the effects of poor early environment than to the effects of perinatal stress." The data from these various longitudinal studies of prenatal and perinatal complications have yet to produce a single predictive variable more potent than the familial and socio-economic characteristics of the caretaking environment. The predictive efficiency of the variable of socio-economic class is especially pronounced for the low end of the IQ scale. Willerman, Broman &amp; Fiedler (1970), compared Bayley developmental scores obtained at 8 months with Stanford-Binet IQs at age 4. For children with a high socio-economic status there was little relationship between their 8-month Bayley scores and their 4-year scores. For children with a low socio-economic status, however, those who did poorly at 8 months continued to do so at 4 years of age. In addition, there was a crossover effect, where the high socio-economic status children who were in the lowest quartile at the 8-month ex amination were performing better at 4 years than were the low socio economic status children who scored in the highest quartile at 8 months. Willerman et al. (1970) see poverty as amplifying IQ deficits in poorly developed infants. The preceding survey of early biological complications concep tualized in the continuum of reproductive casualty (Lilienfeld, Rogers &amp; Pasamanick, 1955) has not found much support for direct long-range consequences. The hypothesized "continuity" in development from early trauma to later deviancy does not appear to hold. There is a serious question as to whether a child who has suffered perinatal trauma, but shows no obvious physical damage, is at any greater risk for later deviancy, either neurological, perceptual, or intellectual, than a child who has not suffered perinatal trauma. In the studies reviewed, the effects of social status tended to reduce or amplify intellectual deficits. In advantaged families infants who had suffered perinatal complications generally showed minor residual effects, if any, at follow-up. Many infants from lower social class homes with identical histories of complications showed significant retardations in later func tioning. Socio-economic status appears to have much stronger in fluence on the course of development than perinatal history. CONTINUUM OF CARETAKING CASUALTY Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) were led to propose a continuum of caretaking casualty to incorporate the environmental risk factors leading toward poor developmental outcomes. Although reproductive casualties may play an initiating role in the production of later problems, it is the caretaking environment that will determine the ul timate outcome. At one end of the caretaking continuum, supportive,</page><page sequence="9">Early Influences on Development compensatory and normalizing environments appear to be able to eliminate the effects of early complications. On the other end of the continuum, caretaking by deprived, stressed, or poorly educated parents tends to exacerbate early difficulties. Where environmental factors have generally been ignored in research efforts aimed at finding linear chains of causality between early pregnancy and delivery complications and later deviancy, they have been the central focus for investigators exploring the role of caretaking practices in producing poor developmental outcomes. Un fortunately, environmentally-oriented researchers have generally been equally one-sided in the way they ignore the child's individuality as a major influence on the caretaking to which he is exposed. Despite these limitations, research into the developmental implications of early caretaking practices has identified many circumstances that contribute to risk. Breakdowns in the parent-child relationship may take a great variety of forms. The most heavily researched and carefully documented of these transactional failures relates to the inability of parents and their children to work out an interactional style which both guarantees the child a reasonable margin of safety and satisfies the child's basic biological and social needs. This is the issue of child abuse. Physical abuse is dramatic evidence of a disorder in the parent child relationship. Child Abuse The major focus of research on the battered child has been devoted to characterizing the personality of the abusive parent. Spinetta &amp; Rigler (1972) in a summary of this research characterized these devi ant parents as of lower intelligence and with higher levels of aggressiveness, impulsivity, immaturity, self-centeredness, tenseness and self-criticism. However, knowing this constellation of personality characteristics does not greatly improve the probability of correctly predicting that child abuse will occur. Other parents with very similar characteristics do not abuse their children, while parents who are abusive will only batter one or two of their children. It appears that certain children are selected for abuse, or rather, that certain children tend to elicit abusive behavior from their parents. Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) were able to find support for the hypothesis that characteristics of the child may predispose the parents to battering or neglect. Klein &amp; Stern (1971), for example, found an association between low birth weight and the battered-child syndrome. Whereas typically 10% of births are of low birth weights, among battered children the rate runs as high as 40%. Klaus &amp; Kennell (1970) suggested that the birth of a premature child may function to overtax the limited resources of certain mothers and precipitate an acute emotional crisis. Many battered children whose birth weights were within normal limits had other significant medical illnesses which might also have served to deplete their mothers' emotional resources.</page><page sequence="10">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY It has been suggested that these problems may be partly the result of separation in the newborn period (Klaus &amp; Kennell, 1970). Because of prematurity or serious illness a high proportion of battered children had been separated earlier from their parents for prolonged periods. Early prolonged separation may permanently impair the affectional ties between parents and children and leave the children vulnerable to parental abuse and neglect. Although it is not always possible to separate truth from rationaliza tion, the parents of abused children frequently describe their offspring as difficult and unmanageable. In one study (Morse, Sahler &amp; Fried man, 1970), for example, 15 of the 25 children studied were con sidered "difficult" by their parents. Other data collected tended to sup port the impressions of the parents that many battered children were problem children preceding the reported abuse or neglect. Reciprocity in Child-Caretaker Relations In all of the risk categories of this survey (including prenatal and perinatal pathology, parental characteristics, and other intra- or extra familial environmental factors) it is possible to identify significant numbers of children who, although subjected to these negative in fluences, nevertheless develop normally (Chess, 1971). Only some of the children subjected to these presumed psychological pathogens do in fact develop disturbances, and only small quantitative relationships have been demonstrated to exist between pathology in either the parents or the environment and pathology in the child (Beiser, 1964). The failure to predict adequately the cases of child abuse appears to have been the result of a research strategy which has been almost exclusively concerned with environmental effects. Children labeled "at risk" have often been regarded as passive victims of external forces and as a consequence are thought to be incapable of having in any way provoked or participated in the difficulties in which they have found themselves (Galdston, 1971 ). As a consequence the victims have often been purposefully excluded from study because their roles have been presumed to be irrelevant. Because much of the research on child abuse has been prompted by concerns with prevention and remedia tion, attention has been focused on those aspects of the problem which have been thought to be more easily changed. The evident importance of the parents and their child-rearing practices pushes characteristics of the children themselves into an incidental role. Bell (1968) took a fresh view of the literature on direction of effects in the caretaking interaction. He pointed out that while viewing infants as helpless victims fits a one-sided model of parental determination of behavior, many studies have shown that the infant is more involved in determining the nature of the interpersonal relationship than was once supposed. Many parent behaviors are not spontaneously emitted in the service of educating the child, but rather are elicited by many of the child's own characteristics and behaviors.</page><page sequence="11">Early Influences on Development The infant's appearance of helplessness and dependency appears to be a strong contributor to the parents' desire to provide care (Rheingold, 1966). However, the response of all caretakers is not necessarily the same. The helplessness of a child can arouse negative as well as positive parental reponse. To the extent that the helplessness and dependency are accompanied by aggravating factors such as, restlessness, colic, and digestive difficulties, the chance of eliciting negative caretaking responses is increased (Bell, 1968). The frequent assumption that the newborn is too ineffectual to carry any legitimate burden of responsibility for the quality of his or her relationship with various caretakers is contradicted by much current research. Constitutional variability in children strongly affects the parents' attitudes and caretaking styles. The systematic investigation of such idiosyncrasies in the child's behavioral organization is, however, of fairly recent origin. In research at New York University, Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch (1968) studied the changes that occur in the child's temperament as a function of the transactions with his family environment. These investigators have described a temperamental constellation which they have labelled "the difficult child." Difficult in fants were found to have low thresholds for arousal, intense reactions when aroused, poor adaptability and irregularity in biological func tioning. Although only 10% of their sample were categorized as dif ficult, 25% of the children who later had behavioral disturbances fell in this group. Without the benefit of longitudinal studies one could easily misinterpret these difficulties of temperament as constitutional weaknesses that predisposed the child to later emotional difficulties. Such static predictions would not, however, prove to be very accurate. In fact, when Thomas, et al. examined the relationship between behavior in the first and fifth year of life few significant correlations were found. What made the difference in outcome for these children appeared to be the behavior of their parents. If the parents were able to adjust to the child's difficult temperament, a good behavioral outcome was likely. If not, the difficulties were exacerbated and behavioral dis turbance often resulted. The transaction was not simply the unidirectional influence of the parents on the child, but also the reciprocal influence of the child on his parents. The impact of these difficult children was such as to disrupt the normal caretaking abilities of their parents. The New York group reported that there were no marked differences in child-rearing at titudes expressed among the various parents in the sample. Whatever differences eventually characterized the parental attitudes of the deviant children apparently arose as a consequence of experience in the parent-child interaction. The range of findings cited in the preceding section tends to support the hypothesis that knowing only the temperament of the child or knowing only the child-rearing attitudes and practices of the parents would not allow one to predict the developmental outcome for the</page><page sequence="12">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY child. It would appear, rather, that it is the character of the specific transactions that occurred between a given child and his parents which determined the course of his subsequent development. If the con tinuum of caretaking casualty is to be useful in elucidating developmental consequences, it must be related to the individual characteristics of the child in question. Neither the constitutionally oriented "continuum of reproductive casualty" nor the environmentally oriented "continuum of caretaking casualty" is predictive when taken alone. It is the combination of these dimensions which would make an understanding of development possible. An evaluation of alternative ways of making such an amalgam will be presented in a later section. CONTINUITY IN INTELLIGENCE AND TEMPERAMENT How is one to explain the general finding of the longitudinal studies reviewed above, that effects of severe early physiological trauma dis appear with age? A possible explanation is that the quality of cognitive funtioning changes with age, so that early aberrations may be irrele vant to later intelligence. Bayley (1949), commenting on the data from the Berkeley Growth Study of intelligence from birth to 18 years of age, noted that individual scores on the tests were unstable and that long range predictions based on early IQ testing were not possible. McCall, Hogarty, &amp; Hurlbut (1972), in a review of longitudinal studies of intelligence, examined the common finding of low cor relations between assessments of "intelligence" during infancy and later "intelligence." These investigators concluded that low cor relations were not a consequence of unreliabilities in the test in struments, but were rather a consequence of qualitative shifts in what is defined as "intelligence" at different ages. They argued against the belief in a "pervasive and developmental^ constant intelligence" on which most longitudinal comparisons have been based. From the available data it would appear that there is no basis for assuming a simple continuity in intellectual competence. Although long-term continuities in development are not found, prediction over short periods of time should be possible (Bayley, 1949). Even this compromise appears unjustified because of the rapid tran sitions in early behavior. Lewis &amp; McGurk (1972) tested infants six times at three- to six-month intervals during the first two years of life. Of the 15 intercorrelations between testings with the Bayley scales, only two were statistically significant. They found the same result in successive testings using a Piaget object conservation task. Scores on infant tests seem to have little power to predict later functioning. Hunt &amp; Bayley (1971) further qualify the value of infant testing by arguing that although these assessments have little predictive power for intellectual superiority, they do differentiate in a general way between normal and retarded individuals. However, this compromise too may be a culturally bound illusion created by the constancies found</page><page sequence="13">Early Influences on Development in Western environments. Cross-cultural studies have found that in fants who would have been judged as severely retarded by Western standards grow to be competently functioning adults (Dennis &amp; Na jarían, 1957; Kagan &amp; Klein, 1973). These qualitative shifts in development are not restricted to intellec tual functioning. Bell, Weller, &amp; Waldrop (1971) noted a complete reversal in some behaviors between the newborn and preschool periods. Newborns who had been easy to arouse and with low thresholds to stimulation tended to be passive and quiet in the pre school period, while newborns who had been difficult to arouse and had high thresholds to stimulation tended to be active and outgoing later. McGrade (1968) found a similar transition between the newborn period and eight-months of age. Since qualitative shifts in development do occur during childhood, it might be thought to be surprising if children did show continuity in their intellectual performance. DEVELOPMENTAL MODELS The preceding review of the search for continuities in psychological functioning was not designed primarily to argue that such continuities are nonexistent, although the evidence seems to point in that direction. Rather, the discussion was aimed toward producing a conclusion that if continuities did exist we were not effectively searching for them. In order to find a more effective strategy one must "decenter," to use Piaget's terminology. Where investigators have focused on searching for developmental stabilities in either the constitution or the environ ment of the child, decentering would permit placing both the child's constitution and environment into a common system. A substantial in crease in the sense one can make out of the developmental process could be provided by a simultaneous integration of these two factors in development. Sameroff &amp; Chandler (1975) outlined three models— main effect, interactional, and transactional—that have been applied with varying degrees of success to explain the data presented earlier. Main-effect Model The essence of the main-effect model is found in the typical nature nurture argument as to whether constitution and environment exert influences on development which are independent of each other. A defect in the constitution of an individual will, according to this model, produce a defective adult irrespective of environmental circumstance, while a pathogenic environment will produce a defective adult in dependent of his constitution. Such a model is attractive to many in vestigators because of its parsimony and has been given strong curren cy in etiological research. Genetic factors as well as constitutional defects caused by pregnancy and delivery complications have often been assumed to exert such unilateral influences on development. As seen in the above review, the general findings of retrospective in</page><page sequence="14">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY vestigations that individuals suffering a wide range of disorders were more likely to have experienced complicated births than individuals without the disorders have not been supported by prospective studies. Although some of the effects of early trauma can be detected during infancy, by the age of seven these effects are almost completely attenuated. While the majority of infants experiencing pregnancy and perinatal complications are not found to have later difficulties when studied prospectively, interactions have been noted between these com plications and the child's environment. For infants raised in a middle class home, with a stable family structure, and with educated parents, there was, for example, no relationship between obstetric com plications and later intelligence or personality. When children with similar complications were raised in a lower SES home, or in an un stable family situation, or with uneducated parents, they were more likely to suffer mental retardation and behavioral problems. In other words, unless the environmental context is also specified, few predic tions can be made about developmental outcome based on perinatal difficulties. It would appear then that the influence of constitutional characteristics on a child's development do not seem to fit a main effect model. Similar conclusions about the inadequacy of predictions based ex clusively on environmental effects also seem warranted. The general finding of studies of deviant caretaking (Spinetta &amp; Rigler, 1972) has been that parents who neglect or abuse their children have different personalities from those who do not. The ability to identify personality characteristics of abusing parents after-the-fact might lead one to presume that predictions can be made before-the-fact that parents having such characteristics would abuse their children. Unfortunately, however, those attributes found to characterize such parents are suf ficiently common that they are of little value in attempting to predict which parents actually will abuse their children. Since abusing parents appear to be selective in the choice of the child they abuse, a missing element in the predictive equation for child abuse would seem to be characteristics specific to the child. As was the case with obstetrical complications taken alone, parental characteristics taken alone are not effective predictors of developmental outcome. Clearly, there are extremes of constitutional disorders, such as severe brain damage, the developmental consequences of which would be deviant in any environment. Similarly, there are obvious ex tremes of environmental disorder which may well produce deviancy in a child of any constitution. These extreme examples are not, however, representative of the vast majority of children who evidence poor developmental outcomes. A main-effects model seems to apply neither to constitutional nor environmental components in development.</page><page sequence="15">Early Influences on Development Interactional Model The preceding discussion would suggest that, at a minimum, any prognostic equation for predicting long range developmental outcomes must include information concerning both the child's constitutional make-up and his caretaking environment. From this point of view one should be able to create a two-dimensional array of constitutions and environments (see Figure 1), with an entry describing the child's developmental outcome for any combination of these two factors. Children with constitutional problems raised in a deviant environment would have poor outcomes. Children with constitutional problems rais ed in supportive environments and children without problems raised in deviant environments would having middling outcomes. The best out comes of all would be expected for children without constitutional problems raised in a supportive environment. While this interactive model substantially increases the statistical efficiency of developmental predictions, it is insufficient to facilitate our understanding of the actual mechanisms leading to later outcomes. The major reason behind the inadequacy of this model is that neither constitution nor environment are necessarily constant over time. At each moment, month, or year the characteristics of both the child and his environment change in important ways. Moreover, these differences are interdependent and change as a function of their mutual influence on one another. The child alters his environment and in turn is altered by the changed world he has created. In order to incor porate these progressive interactions one must move from a static in teractional model to a more dynamic theory of developmental transac tion where there is a continual and progressive interplay between the organism and its environment. Transactional Model Any truly transactional model must stress the plastic character of both the environment and the organism as it actively participates in its own growth. In this model the child's behavior is more than a simple reaction to his environment. Instead, he is actively engaged in attempts to organize and structure his world. The child is in a percep tual state of active re-organization and cannot properly be regarded as maintaining inborn characteristics as static qualitiesm In this view, the constants in development are not some set of traits but rather the processes by which these traits are maintained in the transactions between organism and environment. Exceptional outcomes from this organismic or transactional point of-view are not seen simply as a function of an inborn inability to re spond appropriately, but rather as a function of some continuous malfunction in the organism-environment transaction across time which prevents the child from organizing his world adaptively.

Another major shortcoming resulting from the focus of the interac tional model on product rather than process is its inability to deal with</page><page sequence="17">Early Influences on Development the directionality found in development. Despite the great variety and range of influences on development, there are a surprisingly small number of developmental outcomes. Evolution appears to have built into the human organism regulative mechanisms to produce normal developmental outcomes under all but the most adverse of cir cumstances (Waddington, 1966). Any understanding of deviancies in outcome must be interpreted in the light of this self-righting and self organizing tendency, which appears to move children toward normality in the face of pressure toward deviation. Two possibilities that defeat the self-righting tendencies of the organism and produce deviant development can be considered. The first possibility is that an insult to the organisms' integrative mechanisms prevents the functioning of its self-righting ability, and the second possibility is that environmental forces present throughout development prevent the normal integrations that would occur in a more modal environment. The former possibility can be seen in the pregnancy and delivery complications related to the continuum of reproductive casualty. The latter possibility can be seen in the familial and social abnormalities related to the continuum of caretaking casual ty. These two sources of risk appear to be closely interrelated in the production of positive or negative developmental outcomes. Where the child's vulnerability is heightened through massive or recurrent trauma only an extremely supportive environment can help to restore the nor mal integrative growth process. A seriously brain-damaged child re quiring institutional care would be an instance of such an extreme case of reproductive casualty. On the other extreme a highly disordered caretaking setting might convert the most sturdy and integrated of children into a caretaking casualty. Implications of the Transactional Model Theoretical, methodological, and clinical implications can be drawn from the preceding analysis of models. Theoretically, the failure to find a linear causal chain between reproductive casualty and later deviancy raises serious questions about the frequency with which continuities occur in psychological functioning. The only continuity which is currently evident is the incapacity of certain caretaking environments to respond adaptively to infants with specialized needs (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968). Methodologically, it is apparent that if developmental processes are to be understood, it will not be through continuous assessment of the child alone, but through a continuous assessment of the transactions between the child and his environment to determine how these trans actions facilitate or hinder adaptive integration as both the child and his surroundings change and evolve. A statistical analog of the back and forth influences which underly the transactional model was utiliz ed in a longitudinal study of mother-infant interactions (Clarke Stewart, 1973). Using a cross-lagged panel correlation technique</page><page sequence="18">284 MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY (Campbell, 1963), Clarke-Stewart was able to show a complex reciprocity between mother and infant closely resembling the transac tional model in Figure 1. Between the ages of nine and 14 months maternal attention influenced the child's attachment to her, while from 14 months to 18 months the child's attachment was influencing mater nal attention. Clarke-Stewart suggests that as mother and child seek a balanced interaction, first one and then the other assumes a causal role. INFANT OBSTETRICIAN MOTHER TIME t] t2 t3 t* t5 te "t 7 Figure 2. Hypothetical sequence of transactions in the etiology of emotional disturbance. Clinically, the current tendency to attribute deviancy to intrinsic fac tors such as minimal brain damage or a schizophrenic genotype must be moderated. Attempts to treat an already ill child must be secondary to earlier attempts to help the caretaking environment adjust to the special needs of an infant who may be temperamentally deviant in order to prevent a sensorimotor abnormality from being converted into a cognitive one. Sameroff &amp; Zax (1973) described a complex transac tional sequence for the etiology of mental disorder (see Figure 2). The sequence begins when a pregnant mentally-ill mother by her anxiety influences her obstetrician to use higher levels of medication and an instrumental delivery to speed her through the childbirth experience. A consequence of the complicated delivery could be a hyperactive and fussy child who lacks responsiveness. A consequence of the unrespon sive infant could be anxiety and hostility in the mother. The mother's concerns with her own poor emotional status would prevent her from adequately adapting to the temperament of the child. A vicious cycle can then be produced in which the child becomes increasingly difficult in temperament as the mother becomes increasingly maladaptive in her caretaking, resulting in emotional disturbance for the child. Using a main-effect model the child's deviant outcome would be attributed to either his complicated delivery, his constitutional hyperactivity, or his anxious mother. From the transactional view it is only the complex in terweaving of all these factors which acted to produce the abnormal outcome.</page><page sequence="19">Early Influences on Development Although at first glance one might regret our inability to attribute developmental effects to single causes, once the complexities of the chain of interactions leading to deviancy are elucidated a whole variety of nodal points become available, where interventions can produce better outcomes. Obstetricians can be educated to be more cir cumspect in their treatment of anxious women. The mother herself can undergo childbirth education in order to learn to control her anxiety during the delivery, as well as child-care education to alert her to the effects and modes of dealing with individuality in her child after delivery. Just as evolution has built in the regulating mechanism to counteract deviations in the physical development of the fetus, so too can society construct regulatory mechanisms to compensate for deviations in the behavioral development of the child. CONTINUITY AND DISCONTINUITY Despite the reasonableness of the notion that one should be able to make long-range predictions based on the initial characteristics of a child or his environment, the above review has found little evidence for the validity of such predictions. One view of the inadequacy of developmental predictions sees their source in the scientist's inability to locate the critical links in the causal chain leading from antecedents to consequents. A second view, propounded above, is that such linear sequences are non-existent and that development proceeds through a sequence of regular restructurings of relations within and between the organism and his environment. Escalona &amp; Heider (1959) make the cogent point that "in optimal circumstances, early forms of behavior tend to be dissolved during transition stages of development so that reintegration and the formation of new schemata can take place at each new level of maturity [p. 243]." For the developmental psy chologist, the task becomes to identify these new schemata and levels of maturity. A model of these restructurings for the child has been proposed at length by Piaget (1950) and his disciples. The sequence from sen sorimotor to formal operations, represents a series of such restruc turings in which larger chunks of the world become coordinated at each new level. Although Piaget has proposed particular logical struc tures for each of these stages, they need not be taken as literally as the stages themselves. A diagram of the progression of cognitive develop ment can be seen in Figure 3. The perceptual and motor activities of the child become coordinated during the Sensorimotor period to form ob jects which come to be represented in thought in the Pre-conceptual period. During the Intuitive period attributes of the objects are abstracted and coordinated to form concepts such as length and shape. These concepts then become organized into group structures during the Concrete Operational period so that coordinations can</page><page sequence="20">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY FORMAL OPERATIONAL CONCRETE OPERATIONAL INTUITIVE PRE-CONCEPTUAL SENSORY-MOTOR Figure 3. Piagetian model of stages in cognitive development. be made—as in the classic water-glass example where height and width must be compensated when volume is kept constant. At the For mal Operational period these concrete groups are abstracted and coor dinated into logical systems. A deficit which appears early in development might be translated into a deficit later in development only if each stage in the Piagetian scheme required a particular necessary set of precursors such that if these precursors were missing the new level of coordination would not occur. Such a set of conditions has yet to be identified. Individuals with a variety of deficits still manage to develop the cognitive skills to progress through the developmental sequence and to appear in their use of formal logic no different from individuals without such deficien cies. Deaf children (Furth, 1966), blind children (Witkin, Oltman, Chase, &amp; Friedman, 1971), and motorically-damaged children (those with cerebral palsy, for instance) all can manage to reach normal levels of cognitive functioning. For the developmental sequence shown in Figure 3 one can see how the object permanence and representational ability found in normal children is a result of the coordination of all sensorimotor activities, including vision, audition and touch. In Figure</page><page sequence="21">Early Influences on Development 4 one can see how children with deficits in any of these perceptual domains can still make the necessary cognitive advance based on a limited or skewed distribution of experiences. When appropriate tasks are devised which tap the underlying logic of thinking, rather than per formances which may be adversely influenced by perceptual hand icaps, no evidence of the deficits are found (Furth, 1966). The brunt of developmental data seems to indicate that if there is truly organization in the world, the child will find it and come to know it. DEAF INFANT BLIND INFANT Figure 4. Model for attainment of object permanence and representational process by infants with perceptual handicaps. The question of how deficits are transmitted from one stage to another still remains, however. If they are not transmitted as con stitutional patterns they must be transmitted as experiential patterns. It</page><page sequence="22">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY follows logically that the source of deviancy is in the set of experiences to which a child is exposed. As the development of the child's thought takes him further and further away from his here-and-now sensorimotor experience, the social context plays a larger and larger role in providing the content for his cognitive functioning. It is in this social context that sources of aberrance must be sought. Typically, thought processes which are seen as being other than those of Western middle-class society are judged to be "deficient." This ethnocentric view is under an increasing attack from those who argue that "difference" rather than deficit characterizes the thought and language of minority groups (Labov, 1970) or other cultures (Cole &amp; Bruner, 1971). When tasks are struc tured appropriately or syntax is analyzed appropriately, cognitive com SQUARE CONCERTS SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT OBJECTS CONCEPTS MAGICAL THOUGHT MORAL OBJECTS Figure 5. Bases for different conceptual organization of same objects in thought.</page><page sequence="23">Early Influences on Development plexity in these cultures is found to be little different from what we have come to view as the Western intellectual norm. Werner (1961) has proposed a genetic parallelism between the thought patterns found in Western man, in primitive cultures, and in psychopathological individuals. Although the contents of the particular conceptual frameworks found in these three situations are quite different, the underlying logical structure may be quite similar. Figure 5 shows how the same objects or elements can be organized differential ly, depending on the conceptual system. In the scientific thought typical of Western societies, the norm is to formally objectivize experience in abstract dimensions such as size and shape, exclusive of any subjec tive personal or social influences. In societies where the individual is thought to be intimately involved in his phenomenal world, the subjective-objective distinction is disregarded and elements such as anthropomorphism and magic become significant ingredients of thought. In such a context objects do not exist as abstractions but as containing anthropomorphized dimensions like good and evil (Werner, 1961). In a third example typified by disordered thought, affect can become the primary conceptual organizer so that things are characterized by their capacity to elicit psychic pain or pleasure in the perceiver rather than any dimension inherent to the object (Freud, 1960). More to the point, if a child who would normally show discon tinuities in behavior shows instead continuities in deviancy, the source must be sought in an environment which prevents the child from evok ing the adaptations necessary at new levels of functioning. To be even more specific, the primary environment to be assessed for the develop ing infant is that provided by his caretakers. A number of factors can determine how a mother comes to treat her child. Kohn (1969) has emphasized the role of social class in determining not only the values that parents hold for their children but also how these values are ex pressed in the disciplinary behavior of the parents. Using the transac tional model described earlier, Sameroff (in press) speculated that the cognitive level from which the mother viewed the child was another complicating factor in the manner in which early differences become translated into later deviancies. Depending on the level of complexity with which the mother interprets the behavior of her child, the ensuing transaction could take any one of a number of different directions. Faced with a child who fails to conform to her expectations, a mother can become quite negativistic, with subsequent deleterious effects on her treatment of the child. For example, mothers who ap proach their infants primarily from a sensorimotor perspective require that their physical ministrations be met with responsiveness from the child. If the mother's need for feelings of effectance (White, 1959) are not met, either through the infant's lack of alertness consequent to high levels of medication (Brazelton, 1961), or to the infant's un</page><page sequence="24">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY sootheable fussiness related to a difficult temperament (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968), or to the infant's isolation in a special care nursery (Klaus &amp; Kennel, 1970), or to autism (Tinbergen, 1974), the mother can be led to feel estranged from the infant. From her own feel ing of rejection by the child she can be led in turn to reject the child. The physical as well as psychological prognosis is very poor for such a child since its mother may become a neglectful or abusive caretaker. The physical prognosis is better for infants whose mothers view them from a pre-operational level of cognition. At this level the mother can view the child as an object independent of her own activity, yet she is limited in that the labels with which she chooses to symbolize the child are reified as characteristics of the child. Once a child is labelled as "difficult" or "deviant" or "vulnerable" the label remains with the child throughout development. Eventually, the child incorporates these attributes into his developing self-image and, indeed, actualizes the "self-fulfilling prophecies" of his caretakers. In contrast, mothers who approach their infants primarily from a formal operational perspective can view the child's behavior in the con text of a particular time and space configuration which can be related to a variety of other possible configurations. Deviancies in the child can be perceived as being specific to a particular age period in a particular environment, rather than as concrete expressions of the essential nature of the child. The mother who thinks about her child at this abstract level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity.</page><page sequence="25">Early Influences on Development A second major self-righting tendency might be found at the societal level. To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.
