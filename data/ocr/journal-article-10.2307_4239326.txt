<plain_text><page sequence="1">150 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) Alessandro Portelli The Three Laws of Robotics: Laws of the Text, Laws of Production, Laws of Society* ".And one of the stock plots of science-fiction was that of the invention of a robot-usually pictured as a creature of metal, without soul or emotion. Under the well-known deeds and ultimate fate of Frankenstein and Rossum, there seemed only one change to be rung on this plot.-Robots were created and destroyed their creator; robots were created and destroyed their creator; robots were created and destroyed their creator-."' Isaac Asimov sees this "Frankenstein complex" as part of an anti-scientific tradition which treats science as a violation of nature and a dangerous act of human pride. Since the outset of his career, he has therefore been striving to rehabilitate robots as mere artifacts, built by man and therefore subjected to human control. As we do not expect an automobile or a light bulb to revolt, so we should not be afraid of a rebellion of the robots: like every other machine, a robot may possess built-in security mechanisms which make it harmless. The guarantees Asimov has established are the Three Laws of Robotics. Let us recall these principles which made him a "classic" writer of SF and transformed the genre itself: (1) A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 12) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. (3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection (loes not conflict with the First or Second Law.2 The most visible consequence of the Three Laws is a new attitude toward science, now seen as an instrument for the progress of mankind rather than a threat. Should science ever go out of control, it will not be because of its inherent characteristics, but through the fault of mankind. Asimov thus replaces the catastrophic dystopias of so much classic SF with a rosy, kind-hearted, generic democratic outlook where scientists appear as the new progressive heroes, depositories of knowledge and searchers for truth. As late as 1975, in an article republished by an official US government magazine, Asimov wrote: "The application I of science I cannot be predicted, but we can be sure that it will have both its beneficial and its uncomfortable aspects .... It remains for the wisdom of mankind to make decisions by which advancing knowledge will be used well .... Today's science is tomorrow's solution-and tomorrow's problem, too.'3 The inherent "neutrality" of science is thus reinforced by the nature of the Three Laws. These laws are what are commonly known as "technical norms": rules which give a legal sanction to the techniical aspects of production (e.g., emission control standards). Such laws are generally issued by appropriate government bodies, as is in fact the case of the Three Laws, which emanate from *The present essay is a reworking and expansion of an article originally published in Italian in Calibano. no. 2 (1978). pp. 138-84.</page><page sequence="2">THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS 151 the world government. Therefore, they draw both on the "'neutrality"' of science and the "neutrality"' of the law: they are "just"' laws because they are scientifically necessary:" and vice-versa. Theirs is a double neutrality.4 This is, however, only the groundwork for another and more essential function of the Laws. The technical norms relating to the industrial production of robots implicitly become technical norms presiding over the production of the text-i.e., rhetorical norms. To accept the Three Laws is to accept specific ground rules for the building of character and plot. There can be no starting relationship between human and android characters other than one based on trust on one side and obedience on the other. An act of disobedience on the part of the robot must be eventually shown to have been either an overtly literal act of obedience or a far-sighted one. A human being who fears or mistrusts robots is either a villain who must be defeated or a sceptic who must be convinced (and, given Asimov's views, the two often coincide). Therefore, the Three Laws draw the boundaries of possible plots. The orderly relationship between humans and androids is upset by mistake or sabotage; or, more interestingly, a conflict arises in the interpretation and application of the Laws: typically, one human being can be helped only by harming another, or a conflict between humans is turned into a conflict of the robot's own loyalties. Robots become thus endowed with a psychology of sorts: they have doubts, conflicts, pain, fears. The Three Laws turn these machines into literary machines, capable of producing narrative effects. The transfer of the Three Laws from the production of robots to the production of the text implies that their '"double neutrality'" has now become triple as the technical norm is carried over in the text itself. Science, law, and narrative structures are all equally "necessary," as they all descend in terms ot scientific necessity from the original demand for safety and control. This three-fold defensive structure of necessity is ultimately a flight from choice- i.e., from politics. But attempts to keep politics out of the text are bound to fail, and each attempt only reinforces the sense of its threatening presence. During the 1950s-SF's so-called "Golden Age," and the apex of Asimov's robot cycle- robots suggested much more pressing, here-and-now problems than those of a hypothetical rebellion of the machines-problems that can be summed up under the headings of automation and the industrial reserve army. The security of the middle class and of the upper sections of the labor force (from which a large percentage of consumers of mass literature are drawn) was threatened by the competition of machines and by those strata of the labor force-notably ethnic minorities-who were claiming an equal share in the labor market, thus pulling the wage scale down and proposing to share unemployment as well as jobs. This threat is behind the anti-robot prejudice described in Asimov's The Caves of Steel (1954), which opens with the bitter musings of the protagonist upon the dismissal of an office boy who has been replaced by a humanoid robot. That the robot is described as "'shuffling his feet" with a vacuous grin upon his face only serves to connect the threat of automation to that of integration. The question of labor and ethnic minorities is also crucial in several stories and novels outside the robot canon. Pebble in the Skv (1950) is based on a metaphor of time-travel as emigration. The central character is a Jewish, European-born tailor named Schwartz (i.e., "Black"), who is placed in the midst of a conflict reminiscent of Native American claims for aboriginal rights and of Black demands</page><page sequence="3">152 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) for full equality. The novel is, in the end, a plea for ethnic assimilation, and its marked gradualism opposes "extreme" demands for immediate equality. These would endanger the survival of a perhaps faulty but substantially sound system: "At no time in history has Humanity been as free from war and poverty as now; at no time has Galactic economy been so wisely adjusted; at no time have prospects for the future been as bright. Would you destroy it and begin all over? ... Earth's grievance is legitimate and will be solved some day, if the Galaxy lives."5 The lesson that the survival of the system is the first and essential good can also be drawn from another story, "Strikebreaker" (1957). An outcast is charged with the unsavory but essential task of reprocessing the human refuse upon which the survival of an artificial planet depends. He is well paid but socially shunned; when he revolts against his exclusion, the rest of the population is ready to suffer death rather than allow him to join them. A sympathetic outsider explains to him that his demand is justified but will have to wait until the people are culturally ready for it; meanwhile, his demands are premature and dangerous, and will be not only opposed but actively sabotaged by every right-thinking person.6 The analogy between Blacks and robots is obvious in most of Asimov's work, though he makes half-hearted attempts at covering it up (for instance, both in "Strikebreaker" and in The Naked Sun 119561 he compares the social system to that of ancient Sparta, rather than contemporary Alabama). The fear that the Earth may be surreptitiously integrated by an infiltration of humanoid robots hints at miscegenation, and reproduces the obsession with light-skinned blacks "passing" into the white race. The question of "passing" is at the root of Asimov's finest robot character, R. Daneel Olivaw. He knows he cannot be accepted as an equal among humans but cannot understand why, since he feels in no way their inferior. He takes a special pleasure in passing for human in front of his human detective colleague, an expert in robotics, a fanatic anti-robot extremist.7 "Passing"* is also the theme of "Evidence," a story about a robot who manages to get elected mayor in an anti-robot community (and then again, he may not have been a robot after all: as in Faulkner's Light in August, it is not the fact so much as the doubt of passing which makes it so dreadful). Olivaw's plea is presented in such a way as to induce the reader to sympathize with him. He is one of the few Asimov characters endowed with more than a rudimentary psychology, including a sort of straight-faced, Buster- Keaton humor each time he takes seriously human contradictions and nonsense. But he is entitled to sympathy, after all, because he is so much like us-like Eliza in Uncle Tom 's Cabin, who is so much like white folks it's a shame she's Black. Indeed, the double nature of robots-as machines and as a metaphor for Blacks-involves Asimov in an intricate contradiction: thanks to the fiction he has set up, he cannot support the comparatively respectable cause of racial integration without at the same time supporting the more controversial cause of automation and unemployment. According to the solution he works out in his more recent stories, he seems to be in favor of stressing the racial over the industrial metaphor. In the stories collected in The Bicentennial Man (1976), the parallel between robots and Blacks, far from being covered up, is emphasized and made all the more obvious. The book's title story is remarkable for its skillful treatment of miscegenation: man and robot become more organic. The story may indeed be read as the SF counter-version of Alex Haley's Bicentennial bestseller, Roots: it tells of the robot's fidelity to his owner's family through</page><page sequence="4">THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS 153 several generations, and of his final acceptance as a human being (on the point of death and as a unique. exceptional case) once he has successfully rid himself of all traces of what made him different from the ruling race. Taken together, the three stories collected in this book deal with the blurring of man-machine differences for the sake of assimilation. Yet beneath the egalitarian surface runs a detectable preoccupation that, once differences are abolished, robots will-peacefully-'*take over" (after all, aren't they, in Susan Calvin's words, "a cleaner, better breed than we are"?)8 Thus, "The Life and Times of Multivac" finally reverses the Frankenstein complex by having humans rebel against robots. The role of the Three Laws in the parallel between Blacks and robots is made explicit in The Naked Sun. Here, on a planet much reminiscent of Southern plantations, a murder occurs in which all evidence shows robots to have been at least instrumental. But, like Richard Wright's Bigger Thomas in Native Son, robots ought to be below suspicion. The idea that they may concur in the killing of a man is enough to throw the entire planet into a panic: its entire social structure is based on the certainty that robots 'cannot revolt," on the existence of "good, healthy slave complexes" in the machines.- The Three Laws are thus shown to be much more than controls over a potentially dangerous artifact: they are a strategy for controlling productive labor, for keeping the labor force docile. One may indeed note that Asimov's image of humanoid machines is the reverse of the slave-owner's concept of the slave as "an extension of his master's will," which implies the use of human beings as machines, as tools."' There is a hint in this direction in Ursula Le Guin's Cita of Illusions (1967), where she describes an exploited, colonized Earthman as .a speechless toolman who seemed little more than an extension of the laircar'sl controls."" To anyone familiar with the work of Antonio Gramsci, this insight is bound to suggest unsuspected undercurrents in his definition of the non-hegemonic classes as "strumentali"-literally, "tool-like."'2 A relationship between artificial humanoids and the proletariat can be detected already in Mary Shelley's eponymous novel, where the monster can be read as a metaphor of the new class which the bourgeoisie has brought into existence but can no longer control or get rid of. ("Once brought into existence, robots were not so easily removed," says Asimov'3- and that "removed" merits a pause for reflection.) Robots, then, replace the monster as the aptest metaphor for the basic fears of America's post-war mass society: fear of automation, fear of ethnic minorities, fear of Blacks as the tip of a rising iceberg of submerged labor in the depths of the affluent society. The progressive humanization of Asimov's robot thus points in two directions at once: the blurring of racial lines, but also the process whereby the machine subsumes the humanity of the worker, sucking his physical strength, his professional skill, his knowledge, in true vampire fashion. It is, in other words, a representation of the alienation of the worker into the machine, seen from the machine's end of the finished process.'4 To control the machine is at once to control the worker and the process of production: that the robot is machine and wsorker together only doubles the guarantees of control. The Three Laws are, therefore, not only a reassurance for the audience as to the role of science after Hiroshima, but also a guarantee against alienation and a model for social control-the promise that alienation may be kept in check if society is made stable by a spontaneous, built-in observance of its hierarchy and rules. The First Law establishes class hierarchy an(d subordination.</page><page sequence="5">154 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 7 (1980) the interiorization of power relationships; the Second is the law of discipline ("he is never for a moment to exercise either his will or judgment in opposition to a positive order": it is a South Carolina slave owner speaking of his slaves; it might be Susan Calvin on robots)"&gt;; the Third is the law of the preservation of the labor force. Taken together, the Three Laws guarantee the social stability which is essential to the dynamics of human capitalist and territorial expansion (for which space travel is Asimov's explicit metaphor; but that is another story). Robots are made and sold by a monopolistic corporation known as "US Robots and Mechanical Men"; most of the adventures which make up I, Robot (1950) and The Rest of the Robots (1964) concern new models being tested before marketing. The robot as commodity rounds of the meaning of this central metaphor. The Three Laws are often likened to a guarantee which the company offers the buyer in order to make its products marketable. After production, the Laws therefore control the product-the commodity. But why should there be a need to control commodities? Where do they threaten human beings? Indeed, their threat is even deeper than those we have examined so far. A robot is the physical image of the process whereby "the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race": the literal application, down to the matter of anthropomorphic shape, of Marx's image of the "fetishism of commodities."16 "Reason," a story in I, Robot, is a transposed example of this process. Robots assembled on an outer-space planet become convinced that their Creator is not man. but the great Energy Converter, which they adore as their Master; humans who contradict them are imprisoned according the First Law, to keep them from harm deriving from sacrilege. Showing robots overpowering men in order to worship a fetish is a devious way of suggesting robots overpowering man in order to become fetishes. Still. the Converter which is here exalted to Godhead is itself a "production of the human brain": the robots in this story act as a link/screen between man and the machine/commodity/fetish. Commodity fetishism belongs to "a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him." In such a state, men see their own social action as an "action of objects, which rules the producers instead of being ruled by them."'7 Thus, when Asimov insists, through the Three Laws, that it is possible-to use Marx's words-to "master," ".control," "rule" the robot, he is trying to negate the possibility of commodities controlling, mastering, ruling men. The whole atmosphere of the 1950s was filled with this theme, from David Riesman's The Lonel/ Crowi,d to Vance Packard's The Hidden Peirsuaders-and the fear of thought control is a recurrent theme in Asimov, as witness, say, the Second Foundation (1953). The fear of being controlled concerns primarily America's large middle class- the class of middle-rank controllers: bureaucrats, teachers, executives, officers, etc. Not being directly exploited in a process of material production, their basic, and justified, fear is one of being turned into a sort of machine and commodity ("Custom-made Men," as a trade journal of the 'S0s aptly put it).'8 Thus, the robot as commodity brings together a good many of the social nightmares and fears of the '50s: fear of being displaced by machines; fear of being controlled by machines: fear of being turned into machines. As a m.hchine, the robot vampirizes the worker's brain; as a commodity, the consumer's. The Three Laws stand between the reader and all that.</page><page sequence="6">THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS 155 The complexity of symbolic meanings of the robot makes the Three Laws an exemplary case study in the applicability of concepts from the Marxist critique of political economy to literature. As technical norms, Asimov's Laws regulate production; as legal norms, they confer scientific sanction to the State; as rhetorical norms, they control the text; as political norms, they stabilize society. Production, text, society are thus held together by laws which are not merely homologous but the same. As they extend their jurisdiction from the machine to the text and to the social system, the Three Laws extend to capitalism the sanction of scientific necessity and neutrality. An extra-textual connection may be helpful here. Ralph Nader's consumers' movement (with its mostly middle-class and petty-bourgeois composition) started after Nader proved that automobiles were often liable to go out of control - that the technical norms under which these machines are built did not include anything like absolute guarantees of safety. Nader went on to show that the inadequacy of the technical norms depends on lack of adequate legislation: the consumer is unsafe because the process of production and the process of law-making are not neutral but are both subordinated to profit. The consumer is powerless to control his machine because he cannot control production; he cannot control production because he is powerless to control the State. Nader appears, then, as Asimov's referential negative, establishing the unity of the laws (or lack of laws) regulating technology, profit, and politics. Nader's Italian publishers proceeded to extend the unity to the text, when they re-titled his book (Unsafe at Anv' Speed) with a metaphor oozing literary and mythical reminis- nces-L'auto che uccide ("The Car That Kills"). Like Frankenstein's Creature, like robots but for the Three Laws, Nader's automobile is both the machine and the monster. Perhaps the idea which Asimov fears and negates-and which Nader only skirts without ever really confronting-is that the monstrous, uncontrollable machine which contains the labor force, the means of production, the commodities is neither the robot nor the automobile, but capitalism itself.

Les Trois Lois de la Robotique: lois du texte, lois de la production, lois de la societi.-Les Trois Lois de la Robotique constituent la reponse d 'Isaac Asimov a une attitude traditionnellement soupqonneuse vis-ai-vis de la science et de ses produc- tions. Leur but est de demontrer que les robots (et les machines en general) ne sont pas dangereux par nature; en effet, ils sont construits par ihomme et peuvent donc etre controles. A la nature scientifique des Trois Lois s 'ajoute lefait que celles-ci sont etablies par I Etat, ce qui les rend "neutres ". Cette neutralite6 s 'etend aussiau texte, dans la mesure oi elles deviennnent aussi des lois rhetoriques qui determinent les intrigues, les actants, etc. La nature complexe du robot comme symbole de la machine et du travailleur (en particulier, des Noirs et d'autres minorites ethniques) a pour consetquence que les Trois Lois fonctionnent en meme temps comme normes sociales. Celles-ci assurent le controle du processus de production, et protiegent le lecteur des menaces des machines (automa- tion) et des couches infefrieures de la force de travail (qui interiorise 1'infriorite, la discipline, la conservation de la force de travail). Elles constituent ainsi une solide structure de defense contre les tensions et I 'angoisse repandues dans la societe americaine de l'apres-guerre. Enfin, le robot apparait aussi, chez Asimov, en tant que marchandise, fabriquee poure'tre vendue. Les Trois Lois defendent, pour cette raison, le lecteur contre la menace des objets dans une societe de consommation:fetichisme de la marchandise (le robot est une marchandise qui marche, pense, ressemble a l'homme; bref, c'est le modele du 'fgtiche "de Marx) transformation des etres humains en marchandise et en machine par la competition sur le marcheL du travail, le contr6le de la pensee.
