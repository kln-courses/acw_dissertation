The postmodern period has become the historical period housing the post- (or trans-) human. The end of epic narratives has brought man back to his natural biological state, reminding him that the substance he is made of is the weak link in the universe, and that, come what may, his destiny is set. Nothing can save him from death. But technical innovations of Promethean daring appear to be tearing down and overcoming the final natural barrier to human knowledge. Death will only be a painful memory, and men will live an eternal youth like the gods of Ancient Greece.1 The biosciences are promising us an unlimited development of human nature, the cyborg has become the model for the man of the future?closer to us than Nietzsche's superman we are told?and even aesthetics is attempting to break through the barriers that human nature places on the senses. And yet, as had already been the case for the term "postmodern," whose fortunes need no recalling, the term "posthuman" comes to us from aesthetics as well. In a successful exhibition held in Lausanne, Jeffrey Deitch had used this neologism to indicate the now-acclaimed trend for defining new forms of self and for providing a new definition for the coordinates structuring self-realization and hence for new modalities for constructing one's own identity. Art is modeling its own objects so much according to this trend that it may be claimed that "new approaches to self-realization are generally paralleled by new approaches to art. With each successive transformation of the social environment, great artists have both reflected and helped to define the new personality models that have developed out of society's absorption with technological, political, and social change."2 The ideas all too swiftly developed by Deitch in his catalogue spread like wildfire, so that only a few years were to pass before the publication of a manifesto by an artist, namely Robert Pepperell, who theorized a metaphysics of the posthuman, ranging from a philosophy of nature to a form of ethics and from aesthetics to a politics suitable for the heirs of Homo sapiens.3 The locus of what in the eyes of posthuman theorists should be humanity's new adventure continues to be the conquest of a new space of freedom wherein to construct our own selves, autonomously and independently, with all our various aspects and features, all to be broken down and analyzed automatically, one after another and one because of another, like rosary beads. However, this construction, which really is an anticipation?and everyone knows how often dreams are taken for reality?presents certain elements that remain absolutely basic and foundational. The coordinates that define modern subjectivity are to be thought through afresh. Where is the flawless and unchangeable nucleus of the subject to be found? Where does (one's) self realization reside, (one's) identity, or, better still, the production center of (one's own) self? These are basic questions, since the modalities for constructing (the) self, being an autonomous and independent method devoid of any limitation or external pressure, is a question that goes far beyond any aesthetic of the body or of existence and points towards one's (own) inevitable problematic link to a politics of the body. The posthuman, moreover, is one of the possibilities seen by cybernetics, which characterizes this field far too specifically. The original tendency of cybernetics was to permit the removal of the human body and to transfer the information contained in the brain into a computer. According to Wiener and Moravec, human limitations?which are essentially physical?would finally be brought to an end, but one's subjectivity would still be preserved.4 Yet, to claim 1. Paradoxically, the aim of gerontological studies is to bring about the disappearance of one's own objective and hence one's own raison d'etre; see A. de Grey, "Strategic per un invecchiamento trascurabile ingegnerizzato," in Alterando il destino dell'umanita, ed.

But to claim that it is possible to transfer this same subjectivity to a noncorporeal setting appears controversial, to say the least.7 This mutation regarding the mind-body relationship clearly does not exclude a modification in appearance of the individual's material and corporeal elements. Not only is the mind-body relationship constructed, but it is also reconstructed?as when trying to eliminate the effect of embodiment on mental processes. Whatever the new posthuman body may be, it is subject to the pressures of aesthetic criteria, and at times considerably so. By advancing an alteration of the physical support of the individual's bare life, the posthuman tends to modify indefinitely the potential development of the human body through an alteration in its appearance. A medical cyborg?for example, an individual provided with a cochlear implant?will evidently be not only outwardly different from an individual who does not require this mechanical support, but he will also differ in the sense that his aesthetic appearance will become the site of a form of freedom developed unlimitedly by the techno and biosciences.8 Compared to the human, the posthuman offers a site of greater freedom, as it abolishes limits imposed on physical appearance. It is here that aesthetics and ethics are wedded, but the offspring turns out to be a disappointment to his or her illustrious parents. The countless modification operations?always and solely physical and ranging from tattooing to scarification, from cosmetic surgery to neoprimitivism?are explicitly proposed as resistance modalities against social pressure, which "formats" the bodies in accordance with preestablished, universally accepted models. Hence "neotribal" bodies gain meaning when they are contrasted to the perceived "deadness" and oppression of bodies in Western culture. Producing signs of primitivism on the body asserts and promotes a sense of self-control and self-invention.9 But this creation of the self is almost one-directional, since it encourages its dispersion, its undetermined mutability one might say, without considering the fact, indeed by concealing it, that those who operate in this way are privileged people: Artists such as Orlan do not engage in any metareflection on their artistic activity.10 Indeed, in rare moments of extreme intellectual lucidity, some authors claim that even the most subversive practices, those which have a more violent impact on the senses, are immediately reproduced within those very systems they set out to destroy.11 However, the extreme lack of intellectual reflection contained therein still persists. There has been very little discussion, if any, about why one peculiar type of subjectivity could represent a form of resistance against power, and no debate on the modalities of relating oneself with one's own corporeity.12 Thus no serious thought has been given to the relationship between subject and body, and even less to the multiple, intricate, and complex relationships between individual, person, subject, self, and body. The constant element is represented by the staging of the body as the site of subjectivity that is to be rescued from its passivity in order to reveal itself as a mark of one's autonomy and independence.

The discovery of neuron mirrors has brought decisive evidence to the idea that embodiment is a fundamental aspect of self-realization: See G.

Firstly, cybernetics insists that the man of the future will be freed from the constraints of his corporeity. The cyborg will no longer be a brain in a machine, as in Curt Siodmak's novel Donovan's Brain, but rather will be made out of the brain's information transferred to a computer. Secondly, aesthetics posits that in the posthuman the body will become the possible site for all kinds of experimentation: The cyborg will be a body, which offers itself as a platform for an infinite number of combinations for its own subjectivity. But among its most diverse manifestations, the posthuman converges towards one and the same critical point, namely, its conception of the body, and to be more exact, its awareness of the body's weakness. There is nothing new in this: Indifference towards one's own body is fundamental in Western culture, and even appears as the central myth of the Christianity?namely, immaculate conception, in the form of generating life outside all natural biological rules. "Immaculate conception is nothing but a reproductive technology that avoids the messy chance happening of millions of sperm cells all struggling to fertilize one egg. It is also the refusal to have direct contact between two bodies driven by an irrational desire, a too commonplace and risky procedure for conceiving the Son of God."13 Pollination with artificial organs, all the possible combinations of which are currently being examined by science, would in fact conceal its innate or acquired incapacities. Indeed, Futurism had already sung the praises of the beauty of a fusion between man and machine, but it is only in cyberpunk literature, and more especially in certain writers like William Gibson, Bernard Wolfe, or Bruce Sterling14 that the fusion between organic and inorganic has been transformed into a true fixation.15 Numerous forms of contamination, fusion, and combination between the natural and the cultural, between the biological and the artificial, between the organic and the inorganic generate for the most part cyborg organisms. Yet the definition of "cyborg" is particularly complex not only because it must permit isolating a particular relationship between organic and inorganic into a continuum ranging from an entirely human body to an entirely mechanical body, but also because in order to be able to speak of a cyborg, the integration of any type of technology in and on one's body must be such as to alter the appearance and performances of the mind and the body for good. Nevertheless, as Donna Haraway writes, the cyborg is, and still remains, a metaphor for an alternative power. Faithful to the teachings of Marx, Darwin, and Nietzsche who have definitively shown how deceptive the body's naturalism is, the body for Haraway does not exist prior to social interaction, but is a product thereof. Indeed, bodies "as objects of knowledge are material semiotic generative nodes."16 In other words, the body does not end where its skin ends, but exists in a quasi symbiotic relationship as a contact-producing new form of individuality and differentiation with its immediate environment. Hybridization is thus represented not only as a liberating power, but also as an opening, which may have positive or negative outlets onto a completely different world from the one we know: From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defense, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war. From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animal and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point.17 13. N. Yehya, El cuerpo transformado (Mexico City: Editorial Raidos Mexicans 2001). 14. In this respect, the novels by W. Gibson are to be examined, as well as, and in particular, Neuromancer by B. Sterling (especially The Artificial Kid) and Limbo by B. Wolfe. There is extensive literature on cyborgs, for example: V. Tagliasco, Dizionario degli esseri umani fantastici e artificial7 (Milan: Mondadori, 1999); F. Giovannini, Mostri. Protagonist! dell'immaginario del Novecento: da Frankenstein a Godzilla, da Dracula ai cyborg (Rome: Castelvecchi, 1999). 15. However, reflection on cyborgs, from which literature and cinema largely take their inspiration, finds its origin in the awareness of human weakness. Such awareness becomes especially acute in the context of living in space, of placing the human body outside its natural, earthly habitat In order to make life in space or on other planets acceptable, it was and still is necessary to resolve a series of problems closely related to human morphology and physiology, such as the duration and alternation of the state of waking and vigil state; consequences of radiation, problems of metabolism, hypothermic controls, and oxygenation; as well as carbon dioxide reductions, entrance and exit of fluids, regulation of the enzymatic system and of the system of control of cardiovascular, muscular maintenance, etc. See M. E. Clynes and N. S. Kline, "Cyborgs in Space," in The Cyborg Handbook, ed. C. H. Gray, H. J. Figueroa-Sarriera, and S. Mentor (New York and London: Routledge, 1995). 16. Haraway (see note 6), p. 208. 17. Ibid., p. 154.</page><page sequence="5">348 RES 57/58 SPRING/AUTUMN 2010 Starting out from the idea of the individual as essentially a product, Haraway comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to extend the conception of individuality to its fullest consequences, so that the hybridization with the artificial may open up even further?potentially to infinity?the possibility of the multiplication of the human by rescuing it from the grip of the biopower that still has produced it and made its productions possible. The metaphor of the immune system functions just like a system of an analogical scheme of thought whereby one may think of the possible production of a human body removed from the principle of individuation. The immune system is a fantastic dynamic system of communication with the environment.18 Albeit maintaining coherence inasmuch as an individual body, the exchange of information with the outside and with itself (in order to be able to recognize outside elements the immune system must have a perception of [it]self) brings the immune system? and therefore the cyborg of which it is an analog? into continuous mutation, involves it in a process of differentiation from itself, and places it beyond control by superior orders. Foucault and Canguilhem are not the only strong and clearly discernible influences that are traceable in Haraway's arguments. She also adopts the basic tenets of Deleuze's philosophy?articulated around the questions of nomadism, territorialization, and deterritorialization?regarding the subject's gradual dissipation. Yet the difficulty of Haraway's viewpoint is not so much in the body's hybridization with the artificial, as in the modalities, aims, and objectives with which this hybridization is operated in the cyborg. The optimism and enthusiasm accompanying the anticipation of innovation, which in this context is synonymous with liberation, open up this process to the dangers of the appropriation and instrumentalization of the practical applications of the technosciences, the first signs of which have already been glimpsed: all the more so when we realize that processes of differentiation and dissipation of one's identity, operated through alterations in the individual body are not new, but present in every culture, even in archaic ones, as will be seen further on. The aims of such hybridization are new, but their analysis, amid the current infatuation with the progress of tech nose iences, is still totally inadequate. A similar absence of theory may be noted in the most recent theoretical offshoot of the Western world's tendency towards perfection, the best-known example being the cyborg, namely, a "transhuman" (a term coined by Julian Huxley in 1957) that merges mind and body all in one go, bringing about the elimination of the causes of moral decay, and championing the quest for physical immortality, the mind's perfection, and the body's purity.19 Transhumanism is conceived by Max More, the main theoretician of this movement, as a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many elements in common with humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and an upgrading of human (or transhuman) existence in this life rather than in some supernatural "afterlife." Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and potentials in our lives, rising from various sciences and technologies such as neuroscience and neuropharmacology, life extension, nanotechnology, artificial ultra-intelligence, and space habitation, combined with a rational philosophy and value system.20 In other words, transhumanism must bring about the individual's liberation from his animality through a change in the physical support of his existence, moving him towards a new dimension of consciousness. But as soon as change is mentioned, aesthetic factors come into play, making transhumanism an aesthetic movement: Transhumanist art has been defined by Natasha More as art that is based on the transhumanist principles, visions, goals and sentiments. It is in general optimistic and creative, combining intelligence and emotion in unexpected ways and is future-directed instead of backward-looking. Especially important is the sub-movement of automorphism, 18. "The genetics of the immune system cells, with their high rates of somatic mutation and gene product splicing and rearranging to make finished surface receptors and antibodies, makes a mockery of the notion of a constant genome even within 'one' body. The hierarchical body of old has given way to a network-body of truly amazing complexity and specificity. The immune system is everywhere and nowhere. Its specificities are indefinite if not infinite, and they arise randomly; yet these extraordinary variations are the critical means of maintaining individual bodily coherence." Ibid., p. 218. 19. For the artistic and literary productions of transhumanists, see N. Vita-More, "Extropic Art Manifesto of Transhumanist Arts" (www .transhumanist.biz/extropic.htm, 1982). Transhumanist themes are present in the cyberpunk tradition, with even more explicit references in the nanopunk and the biopunk. A good example of criticism against transhumanism is the film Gattaca, by Andrew Niccol, which takes up the themes of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. 20. M. More, "Transhumanism: A Futurist Philosophy," Extropy no. 6 (1990), revised in 1996, now available on www. maxmore.com/ writing.htm.

On the other hand, it should not be confused with techno and futurist art, which it overlaps with.21 Extropic theorists aim to prolong human existence infinitely by perfecting cryonic techniques, which would allow the human body to be preserved while waiting to be cured of the fatal diseases brought on by age. These very techniques should then at a later stage permit the creation and substitution of various bodies for the same individual, which is made possible by the fact that, according to the Extropics, the center of individuality is represented by the information contained in the brain, which is a real and proper organic machine, capable of inhabiting whatever body without undergoing any alteration. All in all, it would seem, therefore, that all the modalities of hybridization of the human with technology have essentially the same purpose?namely, to try to compensate for acquired or innate natural shortcomings by enhancing, performance of the human being. Thus the body appears exclusively as something inadequate, an "object" whose functions need to be optimized to the farthest limit, which is the body's somatic immortality whereby the reasons for its demise are removed. In other words, in order to be fully understood, the body?and hence also its cerebral functions to the extent that the brain is a bodily organ? is the anchor point of technologies, which have the sole purpose of developing its capacities indefinitely. And although no one has succeeded in defining any rational motives for limiting the development of technologies directed towards enhancing the human being's natural capacities, there is no reason to think that this tendency cannot in principle go on to infinity. And yet posttechnological vitalism has a very powerful aesthetic dimension. From transhumanism to neoprimitivism, the hybridization between the organic and the artificial, the grafting of nonorganic elements onto the biological body, is subject to an anesthetization of aspects of existence. The boundaries between ethics and aesthetics tend to disappear when their application site is represented by the body. To reinvent the individual and to construct a new body has a liberating function from ethical schemes, which are considered antiquated and sterile. To every new form corresponds a new moral. But what is the conceptual and practical consistency of this aesthetical and ethical redefinition of subjectivity? II. The deconstruction, criticism, and genealogy of Foucault's processes of individuation has constituted the theoretical ground of the aesthetics that characterizes the posthuman?with existence also included in their objectives. History's irreducible function in the processes of individuation emerges forcefully in Foucault's thought. The genealogical dimension is not only theoretical and methodological, but also has a fundamental "formal" value, guaranteeing the subject's identity in that it invests its body. Foucault's reference to genealogy does not in fact simply represent an attempt to put the present in a clear perspective, but also refers to the formal problem of b/ography.22 That is to say, genealogy rewrites the history of the bios by showing that "the form of life" is always an operation of power. Hence genealogy is the first main step towards defining forms of subjectivity in which the individual is not only the passive material of the power that shapes him, but also the active subject of the formalization of his bios. The aesthetics of existence Foucault dwelled on during the closing years of his life, having now become a password, a shibboleth of postmodern culture, must necessarily be considered in the duality of its movement, at the risk of its specificity not being understood. It is all too often forgotten that the aesthetic of existence may ultimately have meaning and force only if all its aspects are considered. Firstly, in response to vague discussions about the liberating force of the multiple individualizing powers of the postmodern, Foucault clearly affirms that liberation exists, which would posit itself as a definitive state to be reached and possessed once and for all. The point of liberation in fact lies solely in the process through which it is searched. The only real freedom is represented by the liberating practices.23 Secondly, we should keep in mind Foucault's definition of the all-comprehensive power affecting the entire social body and hence the impossibility of escaping from it, as against a vision of it anchored to the traditional power model, whether repressive or antagonistic, towards which the resistance practices of postmodern aesthetics are directed.24 Thirdly, active individuation? 21.

In other words, if it is true that the subject is essentially made up of the power of truth, then change in the subject-truth relationship represents the individual's possibility of playing an active part in the process of his own individuation: The aesthetic of existence is immediately a policy of truth, and therefore a policy of the truth. The need to operate a genealogy of the forms of the individual's self-realization, Foucault's starting point, is motivated by the hypothesis that it would otherwise not have been possible "to analyze the formation and development of the experience of sexuality since the eighteenth century."25 By genealogy Foucault means an analysis of the practices "by which individuals have been brought to pay attention to themselves, to decipher themselves, to recognize and acknowledge themselves as subjects of desires, putting into play between themselves and themselves a certain relation that permits them to discover in desire the truth of their being, be that natural or lapsed."26 The search for and description of practices of individuation, no matter how partial, limited, incomplete or what you will, represent an attempt to show the noninevitability and the historicity of the constitution of subjectivity for its possible reversal. In the processes of individuation, truth plays a fundamental role, since it is within truth's functioning that the subject must determine its existence. Thus, if Foucault's first moment of reflection regards clarifying the constrictive power of truth, the reasons why the production of truth by the subject obliges him then to recognize himself in what he says appear to be much more interesting than the analysis of the ways in which truth determines the subject.27 Genealogy, which Foucault treats most carefully and in great detail with regard to the subject's disposition towards truth and to the subject's modes of conversion, is based on three fundamental moments: namely, Plato's Socrates, the Stoics of the early centuries of the Roman Empire, and Christianity. Apart from the enormous differences between them, what is interesting to emphasize is that Socratic epistrophe, Stoic techne tou biou, and Christian metanoia all have a well-defined purpose; that is to say, they urge the subject to adopt a form of life for himself not as an end in itself, but as a fundamental relationship with a certain conception, different in each instance, of what is understood as a good life.28 And this "giving shape" to one's subjectivity develops in a strong initiation-line progression, through social rifts, time intervals, individual crises, all of which offer very little scope for any margin of free play. The Stoics in particular, according to Foucault, develop a techne tou biou centered on the self: The basic difference with Socratic epimeleia heautou, as with the type of subjectivity to which the procedures of Christian verbalization are directed, is that the techne tou biou has a specific construction of the self as its main aim and objective, and as its final outcome and site of application. For Socrates, the epimeleia heautou considers the self in its relationships with others in the organization of government: In order to govern and discharge a political office, one must be able to govern oneself and behave well. The reflexivity of self-care and the relationship with oneself is doubled in the Platonic dialogues by an external place, that is to say, the area of government, which represents its place of practice and its real objective. The real purpose of concern for self is to make the subject politically active, responsible for his duties, and in full awareness of their causes. For Christianity, the formative process of subjectivity is not directed towards the subject's autonomy, whether this be ontological or political, nor does it unfold in accordance with a substantial unity. On the one hand, the direction of conscience, the resumption of the pupil-teacher relationship, is directed towards everything except making the pupil autonomous; on the other hand, the postulator's approach to religion is marked by a series of acts that inject discontinuity in the life of the Christian. For example, baptism is both a subject's death to ignorance and chance and a birth to free will and wisdom. The Stoics' self-care represents an askesis of existence, including physical exercise, reading, and writing through which the subject constantly cares for himself. This is done not with the aim, as in Christianity, to bind one to the truth he produces, but to reestablish the link between knowledge and will, which may weaken in daily life, and to restore all their force to the ethical principles, which 25.

It is always the individual's salvation achieved through the subject's conversion that is sought, representing a change in his life form. Yet, Stoic conversion is completely different from Christian metanoia, and it is on this point that Foucault measures not only the different horizon within which similar practices are contained, but also two different and exemplary modalities of the subject-truth relationship. The way in which the Stoics interpret salvation is totally idiosyncratic, because it contemplates a relationship of the subject to himself in which he is simultaneously the agent, object, instrument, and goal towards which he strives. To save himself the subject must therefore be converted to himself, he must complete a kind of circle of which he himself represents every moment by occupying different positions at different times. On the other hand, posing the problem of conversion means questioning oneself about the price to be paid for gaining access to the truth and the transformations the subject must undergo in order to have the right to know and speak the truth. Christian metanoia, on the other hand, consists of a single, unrepeatable metahistorical event, which interrupts the subject's unity and represents an act of renunciation of oneself that makes him pass from death to life, from ignorance to knowledge. Hellenistic Roman conversion does not unfold through a movement of rupture, but is created by the continuity of the movement with which the subject turns himself towards himself. It is more like an auto-individuation than a trans-individuation, a long continuous autonomous process rather than a single event, which interrupts the subject's unity and identity.29 What appears to interest Foucault, and also appears fundamental in the economy of his discourse, is that conversion?whether it be Platonic epistrophe es heauton, Christian metanoia, or Stoic?is the theoretical point where the subject establishes relationships with knowledge and truth that are absolutely essential and which can be either constitutive of an ethics or not. Despite the use of a series of metaphors ("create a space around yourself," "don't become distracted," "think about your objective, or about the distance between yourself and your objective"), which appear to make self-knowledge irreconcilable with world knowledge and the knowledge of nature, the significant contrast is not between self-knowledge and that of nature but between ethopoietic knowledge and ethically neutral knowledge. The caesura does not cross the object of knowledge but dissects the subject and refers most directly to a singularization of knowing. In all three cases, the structure of the conceptual scheme is identical: The aesthetics of one's existence, the attention paid to what one is and to what one becomes in the course of existence, has a very precise purpose, which is political for the Greeks, ethical for the Stoics, and apophatic for the Christians. Aesthetics finds itself entangled in an extremely tight conceptual and theoretical net in which even the empowering of the physical, material, and corporeal powers is aimed towards an ethically better life, where the best one tries to attain has an intensive value and not an extensive one, as seems to be the case for posthumanist ideologies. Yet, its relationship with truth appears fundamental in this perspective. Bios stands out in relation to biological life, relegating it to the role of simple support that does not have the least influence on the quality of the subject's "life form." The aesthetization of existence is relevant to it only as bios, but not as zoe, the consistency of which is, in the best of cases, ignored. The distance of Foucault's analyses from the role that is ascribed to it in postmodern culture is clear. The theoretical indigence of posthumanism and more especially its indiscriminate enthusiasm for science and progress?far from being nonideological?have nothing to do with the genealogical deconstruction of subjectivity as operated by Foucault. While posthumanism is limited to postulating the liberating energy of technology without being in the least concerned with a more rigorous theorization of the concepts that it actually adopts?or about the economic and material presuppositions that govern their usefulness, or with the way in which capitalism exploits the means and effects of technology, or with the practical effectiveness of the aims of technology? Foucault's perspective appears quite different if for no other reason than that the basic concepts of this intricate theoretical nucleus represented by the production of subjectivity are strongly thematized. Liberation, ethics, aesthetics, subjectivity, power, and resistance are likewise constitutive concepts of the aesthetic of existence, with which it may be legitimate to disagree, but whose theoretical significance cannot be ignored. III. But the theoretical vagueness and conceptual inconsistency of posthumanist and transhumanist formulations?which, it is to be remembered, are simply offshoots of the vitalistic ideology of modernity 29. Ibid., p. 202.</page><page sequence="9">352 RES 57/58 SPRING/AUTUMN 2010 with extremely relevant political ramifications and consequences?become even more noticeable given that in these contexts death appears if not exactly as a fastidiously unerasable vestige, then at least as the unpleasant reminder of the weaknesses of our body. Foucault himself does not seem to have given an excessively important role to death in the processes of individuation, even though ideas can be found to which there was no follow-up.30 And yet the role played by death in the cultural construction of individuality and subjectivity has always been fundamental. It is difficult for the idea of an aesthetics of existence to make any inroads as long as it excludes death. Certainly the end of life cannot have any function when life is reduced to empowering the zoe, since zoe and thanathos are mutually exclusive, as biological life is opposed to biological death. But logically speaking, the situation changes dramatically when we move on to characterized life: bios, the life that gives itself a form, contains, or may contain, thanathos in the sense that "a characterized death is part of a characterized life. Such a life in fact is characterized by the way of its ceasing/'31 In other words, the idea appears completely coherent that whereas death for zoe is an incomprehensible paradox, because when there is death zoe inevitably comes to cease, death for bios is a constitutive and formative element. Thus, at least, from an exclusively aesthetic viewpoint, the role of death appears to be formative and constitutive. The reassertion of the formative role of death should therefore lead towards making it the equivalent of bios so that if a biological death corresponds to a biological life, an equally formed and formal death should correspond to the "life form" of the bios. The theoretical and philosophical reactivation of the ancient tradition of melethe thanatou might represent the prelude to a philosophy and an aesthetic of existence centered on death and not on life, on weakening and not on strengthening, on disappearance and not on production. For Plato melethe thanatou is known to have an exact meaning. As indicated in the Phaedo, "those who philosophize are rightly practicing how to die, and [...] death for them is a much less frightening thing than for any other man." This exercise consists in training oneself to "loosen and separate the soul from the body," to restore it to the real life it will be able to start living, once it will have separated itself from the body.32 But there is also another aspect: Learning how to die transforms "the tone and level of the inner life." Not only the moral, but also the political value of this ascesis (rigorous self denial) is well summed up by Montaigne who writes that "he who has learned to die, has unlearned to serve."33 Echoes of this phrase go well beyond the sixteenth century, and passing through the dialectic of master and slave of Hegelian memory, extend all the way to Heidegger's "being-for-death."34 The reflection on death is therefore the central moment of assuming responsibility for one's own existence, which at its most extreme leads to a real and proper conversion of the subject. Articulated through learning how to die, individuation rotates on its own axis, and for Plato passes "from a vision of things dominated by individual passions to a representation of the world governed by the universality and objectivity of thought."35 In this case, therefore, the melethe thanatou is not only attention paid to one's own demise, but also a recentering of bios on death, so that it is the form of bios itself that is to be constituted by death. All this tradition of thought articulated on a memento mor\, which appears to lead to well-determined political and social forms of behavior and only with difficulty can be reduced to an attitude of contrition and repentance, disappears completely under the influence of the growing medicalization of the collective and individual body.36 Not only does the West appear to have lost all forms of 30.

As has been pertinently observed, "the arrogance and ambition of biomedical science is largely responsible for the dangerous and disastrous rejection of death that is prevalent in contemporary society."37 But if medicine has gotten the upper hand in the terminal management of existence, this is not only due to scientific reasons. In fact, all the theoretical configurations of modern thought, starting at least with Descartes, move in this direction, trying to treat death as a simple mechanical event and ignore its formative role in human experience. And yet not all cultures adopt the disenchanted attitude towards death that is characteristic of today's advanced Western societies. Indeed, the more "archaic" they are, the more strongly ritualized is death,38 to the extent that being completely pervaded by a thanatology, archaic thought "is not reducible to funeral customs (as they are everywhere). It is Weltanschauung and weltanschaulich, 'ideology.'"39 Even the rules of subdivision and circulation within the social space, whose segments are object of prohibitions differently affecting men and women, appear to be associated with death, decomposition, and blood. Promiscuity between men and women is possible on the basis "of a symbolic matrix which exploits contiguity" between female menstruation and the decomposition of dead man's corpse.40 The village is built around two polarities, namely, the men's house and the space of the menses. From this division further segmentation of social space ensues. The men's house is furthermore subdivided internally by the "system of degrees" of initiation, which arranges the male community in a hierarchy in function of the men's initiation into an esoteric awareness regarding death: The omnipresent criterion of spatial partition (divided lands, time divisions from birth to death and beyond), which in hierarchical progression creates a continuity which seems to ignore the gap between life and death, since every segment refers to death. Life is a process oriented by death. With death, the dialectic nucleus of an all-encompassing thanatology, which presupposes the idea of an evolution through stages that are frontiers (or barriers), the degrees become a fixed collection of partitions, that is to say, a complete one. An upward-progressing scale. When the ontological identity is finally reached, the post mortem crystallization of the now deceased individual's identity is completed.41 But the men's home is also a place for conserving the reliquaries of their ancestors: The entire site on which the tribe is set is oriented by the presence of the reliquaries and is organized and subdivided in function of their being possessed. Inside the men's house, the social segmentation whereby the grading system is structured operates by following the same criterion of "closeness" to death?where this criterion must be understood as the degree of initiation one has reached. Hence, initiation provides access to esoteric knowledge that refers to death. But it is not a question of an initiation?at least with regard to the New-Hebrides culture, which figures here as a metonymic example?that introduces noninitiates directly to a hidden world. The secret is revealed degree by degree, whereby "every stage reveals a secret,"42 and this gradual process envelops the individual's entire existence. The initiate, however, does not accumulate wisdom. The role of knowledge is not aimed at an external target.43 Indeed, [... ] what seems in contrast to motivate the New-Hebrides initiate to try and reach a desired ontological perfection (significantly represented by a premature death: The last step is the one where the individual, albeit still alive, "is already dead") is a conception of the human and of his spirit whereby wisdom consists in discovering not only that without secrecy there is no knowledge (and that this acknowledges phenomenological self-evidence in being at one and the same time a thetic obstacle and a stimulus), but which, in penetrating the secret and becoming physically part thereof, the hidden void appears in its entirety in the vast universe of secrets which earlier, from one stage to the other, enveloped it.44 The knowledge the initiate gains is wisdom of the totality and of the only secret that considers the totality, namely death, inasmuch as it is an insuperable limit: This knowledge supposes that a limit is reached where there is nothing more to be known (except the unknowable, 37.

To reach that limit is a victory. It implies that the limit is indescribable in being unknowable ("limit" is a word expressing two aspects: the one reached and the other unattainable) and which is sovereign. Here as elsewhere, the archaic weaves a unique tapestry with death. It is a material death transfused into life, taken not as a target but as a daily osmosis. A fatality, which interweaves scenes and figures but in which the appearance is burdened with allusions to what death is not physically, that is to say a redemption. If there is something in the archaic that can approach it, it will be the outlet in the inhuman/nonhuman, unknowable to all the senses, including the useful formula of totemism.45 Here, the initiate is, as in all conversions, a living corpse: separate, far from his pre-initiation existence, and thus dead to unconscious life. But then to the extent to which initiation consists essentially of penetrating into the secret of indefiniteness by accepting the death that will come to him, the initiate "during all the life that will follow personifies the dead person who one day he will be."46 In short, during the initiation rites, the subject is changed, modified, destructured through gaining ever more profound wisdom and with extremely precise objectives. The relationship between wisdom and cyborg is an end in itself: The cyborg accumulates information haphazardly. The Stoic wishes to know whether his life is in keeping with the truth that inspires him: He adapts the wisdom of nature as confirmation of the correctness of his own choices. The archaic individual assimilates wisdom with the precise aim of progressing in the esoteric hierarchy of the initiates and of gaining deeper knowledge of himself, he acquires ontological and cosmological knowledge of nature?the inconsistency of which will be revealed by the outcome of the initiation? as a source of freedom from the chains of contingency. The cyborg accumulates and exchanges information with its environment, this being a simple instrument, which directs itself towards realizing its partial aims. Progressive initiation is a journey that has a clearly defined purpose, which consists in reaching the state of a living dead. When the individual reaches this state, it allows him to be included in the category of his ancestors and therefore to enjoy a life after death: Although continuing to live, dying allows one to live as a dead person. Associated with this initiation progression of the dead person-who-lives, another person is born, who is connected to the representation of the ancestors.47 Every production of an effigy marks a passage of degree, and gradually as one proceeds in the initiation, effigy production loses its mimetic relationship with the represented ancestor. Thus we move from the rambramb (the dead person's decapitated and painted corpse) and the manikins (a collage of skulls grafted on an artificial body), to the fougeres and the concave anthropomorphic vertical drums, and finally to the stone stelae.48 Every object represents a moment in the course of initiation, yet always also the ancestor with whom one wishes to enter into a relationship)?and it is perhaps useless to insist on their aesthetic value. But as one gradually progresses along the road to knowledge, the representation of the ancestor becomes ever more vague until it dissolves into the stagnation and solemnity of the stone stele. It seems correct to think that to the emptying of the effigies, which are symbols of the transformations the initiate undergoes in the various phases of his journey, there corresponds the incorporation in the craftsmen of the characteristics of the ancestor being represented. The body of the initiate gradually is filled with the spirit of the ancestor and gradually the artifact becomes a function or an intermediary between the one and the other. The aesthetic of existence here loses its every manifestation and attraction in order to concentrate on the only element that perhaps makes the individual's existence unique?that is to say, the way in which he goes towards its end. 45. Ibid., p. 51. 46. Ibid., p. 85. Despite everything, the only theoretical configuration that can approach the way of the archaic moments discussed previously is represented by primitive Christianity. Primitive Christianity is that moment in the history of the church in which the excruciating question of the moment of the advent and salvation is transformed into an interrogation on modalities of existence, to the postponement of the moment of parousia responds the "already here and now," which represents the temporal existence of the Christian who possesses a specific wisdom, since his spirit has been converted by faith. For the primitive Christians the question of how to live "does not refer back to an objective time, to the time of the world, but to a knowledge already acquired of the authentic relation to the self?even in terms of temporality, it is a knowledge by which the Christian becomes that, which he already is 'in fact'" (F. Dastur, La mort [Paris: PUF, 2007], p. 39; editor's translation). This wisdom-relationship with oneself is possible only against the background of a death that is known in all its various facets and which represents the main moment in the life of the Christian, inasmuch as being the beginning of a new life. And it is this relationship that becomes real and guides the process of the individual perfection of the Christian. 47. Ibid., p. 134. 48. Ibid., p. 137.</page></plain_text>
