Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1979. $9.95, xv+220pp. The Heretical Imperative is Berger 's first major work within the sociology of religion for ten years and it is important to discover whether it is a further development of the line of thought of A Rumour of Angels (1969), or indeed to what extent it is a new departure arising out of his interest in modernization. Berger himself goes part of the way to suggesting the latter in an autobiographical preface. Here he contrasts the wide range of choices open to 'Western man' with the fate which still governs life in less developed areas of the world. The book itself opens with an extended metaphor emphasizing this very dichotomy, thus suggesting a style reminiscent of Pyramids of Sacrifice (1974). In this instance however Berger does not proceed to a political or moral treatise on the choice versus fate dilemma but rather to an analysis of the religious alternatives available in contemporary Western society. Such a theme, notes Berger, cannot be handled metaphorically. The style then is vintage Berger prose: the building of models, the packing of illustrative material and the characteristic if temporary abandonment of the value-free approach to allow 'Berger qua Christian* to state his opinion. The first chapter reiterates and develops a theme Berger has taken up before - that of the dialectical relationship between moder- nity and pluralism. The crucial assertion for the purpose at hand being that modernity pluralizes not only institutions but world views and the available plausibility structures thus making choice a necessity: the creation of the 'heretical imperative'. A brief mention is made of the existence of a totalitarian state as an alternative to the decision-making role for modern man but this is quickly dismissed. Berger utilizes the second chapter to work through his Ã¹nderstanding of religion much as he did with modernity in the first, noting that he wishes a broad definition of the 'religious experience' including both the supernatural and the sacred. The import- ance of religious tradition as the answer to the question 'How can the nocturnal voices of the angels be remembered in the sobering daytime of ordinary life?' (p. 49) is asserted and he sets out an overtly typological approach which will encompass the main argument of the book. He sets forth three possible responses for those who would pre- serve something of religious tradition in the face of modern secularized consciousness, these being respectively the deductive, reductive and inductive possibilities. 'The Deductive Possibility: Reaffirming Tradition' covers all those 're-' or 'neo-' movements which after a period of doubting or disbelief reaffirm the classical tradition; a noisy business since the previous doubts must be drowned out and a plausibility structure rebuilt. Protestant neo-orthodoxy is used as a particular example of the general theme with Berger's work attracting critical attention. In dismissing this possibility Berger opposes to Barth 's assertion that man can only receive faith as 'manna from heaven' two points: firstly, the will to make a Kirkegaardian 'leap of faith' must surely be found within man, and secondly, given a plurality of religious tradition which is one to affirm? 'The Reductive Possibility: Modernizing Tradition' describes movements like the demythologizers who would have the religious tradition translated into language and ideas appropriate to modernity. Here Berger describes the cognitive bartering which exists when the given environment is modernity and at question are the miracles and the authority of Scripture. Berger's counter-argument in this case is that the theological left is just not brave enough, it dare not let go of the very act of God in Christ, why grasp at the very remnants of traditions at all - 'If the worldview of modern secularity is true, one should have the decency to stop using religious language. ' (p. 118). This seemingly subjective rejection of the 'reductive possibility' is bolstered by a critique of Feuerbach and modern philoso- phy in general for treating religion as an anthropomorphic projection and ignoring</page><page sequence="2">SHORTER NOTICES 311 the opposite position - humanity could itself be a symbol of another reality. But that cannot easily be appreciated by modern secularized consciousness and therefore this possibility is rejected as ill-founded. Having thus built up a tripartite argument and demolished his first two possibilities one feels the pace of The Heretical Imperative leap as Berger rushes off in pursuit of 'The Induc- tive Possibility: From Tradition to Experi- pence', which should perhaps have been more aptly subtitled 'Personalizing Tradi- tion'. Before entering the main argument Berger betrays the attraction of this model for him by noting that unlike the others which he argues intrinsically could accept the validity of only one faith, since the evidence for the inductive possibility is personal experience this can be considered within any particular tradition or ortho- doxy. Again he turns to Protestantism for his example, using this time the work of Schleiermacher and in raising a defence of classical theological liberalism he retreats further and further into the shell of personal experience. So equipped with the empirical evidence of experience and the method- ological tool of inductive reasoning Berger argues that one can then, neither bowing to nor denying the secularizing influence of modernity, look for a faith by under- taking a study of comparative religion. It is in the final chapter that Berger's purpose becomes clearer - he most certainly does want to continue from the anthro- pological starting point he introduced in A Rumour of Angels but in a less parochial sense. The inductive possibility is the right one for Berger because it is the most practical, in terms of his agenda, to look at religious experiences ranging from the Judaeo- Christian confrontation with the divine to the mystical intensity of the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The closing pages are as one has come to expect a restatement of Berger 's own Christian faith and of his hopes for a confrontation of religions, in the sense that the fullness of human religious experience may become apparent. An agenda towards this end is set out in The Heretical Imperative - a study of personal religious experience, which is as Wm. James has shown a task of microscopic detail, and a process of inductive reasoning which will thence draw conclusions on the nature and the validity of faith - the task is of such im- mense proportions that one wonders whether such an agenda could ever be taken up. Perhaps Berger himself will make his choice to proceed in just such a fashion within the realms of comparative religion. University of Glasgow JUNE E. MILLIGAN</page></plain_text>
