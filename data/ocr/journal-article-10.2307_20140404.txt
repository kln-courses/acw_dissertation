<plain_text><page sequence="1">Grammar and expression in early Renaissance architecture Brunelleschi and Alberti CHARLES BURROUGHS Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) exemplifies "the shift from the artisan to the learned artist creator." So writes the eminent Alberti scholar Cecil Grayson, and there are perhaps few who would disagree.1 But Grayson's seemingly unremarkable assertion implies the acceptance of a single standard and content of learning, evidently in contrast to the knowledge accumulated by "artisans," in which, nevertheless, Alberti himself showed a lively interest.2 Clearly, Grayson's "learning" is specifically that of humanism, of which Alberti was a leading, if sometimes ambivalent, exponent.3 Grayson's brief account of epochal change (published, it should be noted, in 1972) implicitly assigns to Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) the role of "artisan,"1 as inventor of technical procedures theorized-indeed transmuted into "learning" by Alberti, an assessment by and large also conveyed in the latest monograph on the older architect.4 Indeed, Brunelleschi apprenticed with a goldsmith and never showed any interest in turning himself into a humanist, a career-enhancing strategy followed by his contemporary, the occasional architect Lorenzo Ghiberti, as well as much later, more assiduously and famously, by Andrea Palladio.5 In my view, Brunelleschi's achievement depended, even if indirectly, on a crucial late-medieval intellectual disciplinary and discursive domain-a field of "learning"-that humanism in general opposed and ultimately destroyed. The field in question was the philosophical study of grammar, a subject of particular interest to Alberti, whose approach to the subject was, however, conducted on quite different premises and whose emergence as an architect, as I will suggest, depended not only on the careful formulation of a critical position toward Brunelleschi's architecture in general, but also on the close involvement in the assessment and elaboration of a particular Brunelleschian project. Most accounts of Alberti's career represent his direct experience of architectural planning and design as opposed to the engagement with theory and the legacy of antiquity-as subsequent to the writing of his architectural treatise.6 I will consider the possibility that 1.

Alberti, of course, spent his life playing roles, including that of "humanist," with extreme self-consciousness; see, e.g., M. Baxandall, Giotto and the Orators: Humanist Observers of Painting in Italy and the Discovery of Pictorial Composition 1350-1450, Oxford-Warburg Studies (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), p. 121: "Alberti was a completely equipped humanist, but when he writes about painting he no longer belongs entirely with the humanists; he is instead a painter, perhaps of a rather eccentric kind, with access to humanist resources." On Alberti's ambivalence in general, see M. Tafuri, "'Cives esse non licere.'

(Cf., id., "Vecchie e nuove prospettive sul Brunelleschi," in Filippo Brunelleschi: la sua opera e il suo tempo, ed. Pina Ragionieri [Florence: Centro Di, 19801, p. 476). Saalman reacts against an older tradition of scholarship that stamped Brunelleschi as the great herald of modernity; he finds, however, that "the truly revolutionary thinker and planner of the Early Renaissance was Leon Battista Alberti, who turned architectural theory and practice in a wholly new direction" (p. 422). This is surely as exaggerated a view as the one Saalman rejects. 5. On Ghiberti as architect, see A. Bruschi, "Note sulla formazione architettonica dell'Alberti," Palladio 25 (1 978):1 8. 6. Bruschi (ibid., p. 14) stresses Alberti's earlier interest in architecture but associates him with a current of "sculptor's architecture" in the late 1430s (Donatello, Ghiberti, Michelozzo, etc.) and even entertains the suggestion (p. 15, cf. p. 20) that "Albertian ideas," if not Alberti, played an active role in the elaboration of this. He maintains (p. 27) that serious work on the treatise could not have commenced until circa 1443, the year of Alberti's return to Rome. But he also argues that Alberti's initial involvement in an architectural design process occurred when Alberti was in Ferrara, especially in 1442, when he evidently played a role-as architect?-in the design of the Arco del Cavallo for Leonello d'Este, soon after the latter's</page><page sequence="2">40 RES 34 AUTUMN 1998 in architecture, as in many of Alberti's fields of interest, contemplation and action were closely linked.7 In Florence in 1441, the recently completed dome of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore loomed over a spectacle of remarkable irrelevance to the sacred values and purposes the great building had been constructed to accommodate and express. One by one, men came forward-hardly a priest among them-and before a large and attentive audience declaimed verses, not on the relations between humankind and a transcendent deity, but between man and man. The theme of the verses was friendship; the organizer, who himself wrote a lengthy prose meditation on the topic for the occasion, was Leon Battista Alberti.8 Since 1434, Alberti had been in Florence with the papal court, which he served as an official in the secretariat of Pope Eugenius IV. The pope was in Florence to preside over a council summoned to negotiate the reconciliation of the western and eastern churches, the latter motivated by the threat of Ottoman power that, in little more than a decade, would engulf Constantinople itself.9 The pope was lodged and the council sessions located at the great Dominican monastery and center of learning of S. Maria Novella. This was the site of the famous exchanges between senior representatives of Greek intellectual traditions and individuals in the western delegation who had risen to prominence through distinction in "the new learning" of humanism, which ideally encompassed direct and profound exposure to ancient Greek as well as Latin letters.10 On paper, the council ended successfully in 1439 with the proclamation in the cathedral of the union of the Latin and Greek churches, though this was never accepted by many Byzantines and was anyway soon overtaken by the Turkish advance. The advantages sought by the Florentine government in expensively hosting the council, however, were no doubt not primarily of religious nature, but had to do rather with securing the inextricably entwined commercial and cultural prominence of the city. The Medicean regime went to great lengths to attract the council to Florence, an outcome requiring extensive negotiations that were entrusted to Lorenzo de' Medici, Cosimo's brother."1 The readings in the cathedral in 1441, therefore, had something of an official character and were certainly associated with Florentine and Medicean concerns with both external and internal self-representation. No doubt to spur public interest, the readings were conducted as a competition; the prize was a silver laurel wreath that presumably, in the long tradition of poetic coronations, was to crown the victor. Accordingly, the event itself bore the title certame coronario.12 A jury of some of the most qualified professional writers of the day members of the papal chancery, colleagues of Alberti sat in judgment over the poems declaimed before them, though some authors (including Alberti himself) read works that were not entered in the competition for the wreath. The judges failed to reach unanimity regarding the appropriate recipient of the laurel wreath and some seem to have been antipathetic to the whole accession as duke. Bruschi emphasizes the arch's formal links with current Florentine work, rather than Roman antiquity. See now C. Rosenberg, The Este Monuments and Urban Development in Renaissance Ferrara (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 57-61; after a detailed review of the evidence, Rosenberg finds Alberti's involvement in the project extremely probable. C. Grayson, "The Composition of L. B. Alberti's Decem libri de re aedificatoria," MuinchnerJahrbuch far Kunstgeschichte 11 (1960):155, notes expressions of interest in architecture in Alberti's writings between 1435 and 1440, sufficient in Grayson's view to justify acceptance of 1452 as the effective completion date of the treatise. 7. The immediate objection to this is the shift at the beginning of book six of the De re aedificatoria from a more theoretical approach to one firmly based in the study of the monuments and the implications of this for current design practice; see Bruschi (see note 5), p. 30. 8. The fullest account of this is G. Gorni, "Storia del Certame coronario," Rinascimento 22 (1972):135-181; cf., id., "Certame coronario," Lingua Nostra 37 (1976):11-14. See also G.

Bertolini, ed., De vera amicitia: i testi del primo Certame coronario (Ferrara: Istituto di Studi Rinascimentali and Franco Cosimo Panini, 1993). Alberti's prose work became book four of the Della Famiglia; he also wrote a poem in hexameters on friendship. See Bertolini, pp. 153-155; L. B. Alberti, Rime e versioni poetiche, ed. G.

It was not the content but the medium of the poems read in the cathedral in 1441 that engendered vehemently opposed views. They were neither in Latin nor in Greek, but in the Tuscan vernacular. Alberti's marked interest in this in the 1430s and early 1440s, however, was to a degree that of a self-conscious cultural outsider, born in Genoa and raised in Venice and Padua.14 Indeed, shortly after the certame he authored the first grammar of the Tuscan dialect (or of the Italian language in general), ordering and objectifying what came naturally to Florentines. In late-medieval Florence, as Paul Gehl has noted, all grammatical training was part of the process of latinization, involving the acquisition not just of Latin, but also of bilingualism, not to speak of access to professional, technical, and intellectual domains closed to those with facility only in the vernacular.15 Alberti's grammar displays the regularity of the vernacular first language and its susceptibility to analysis in the same way as Latin. Its thrust, therefore, is more a matter of polemics than pedagogy, raising the prospect of a relatively unified culture centered in Florence and ideally defined by the topography of language use rather than by the socially and economically determined access to exclusive forms and sites of instruction. But Alberti's grammar also challenged the monopoly of the existing educational regime in the provision of grammatical training, with all the moral associations that Gehl has brought into focus. Not only linguistic usage or educational practices, but also significant cultural patterns and institutional interests were ultimately at stake. In the existing structures of Latin instruction, grammatical study provided the foundation and led to the teaching of composition. In his engagement with the vernacular, Alberti reversed this sequence: his grammar, written around 1443, chronologically followed the certame and other projects intended to advance the cause of literary expression in the vernacular. The certame, moreover, raised to the level of spectacle (as some called it) a debate that had previously been confined to literary exchanges.16 The protagonists of these had been, however, two of the greatest exponents of early-fifteenth-century humanism, Leonardo Bruni in 1441, the chancellor of Florence-and Flavio Biondo.17 The argument between Biondo and Bruni had begun as a debate already a kind of certame-in Florence in 1435. It turned essentially on the status of Italian as a language of culture in its own right. Bruni held that Italian was and always had been a degraded form of Latin and was derived from the language of the streets of ancient Italy. For both Biondo and Alberti, on the other hand, Italian had succeeded Latin as the language of all social classes. It had developed in response to historical 13. Mancini (see note 8), p. 205 14. R. N. Watkins, The Family in Renaissance Florence (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 1969), p. 4. Alberti's mother was Genoese, but she died in 1406. Doubtless his father, Lorenzo, and other relatives used Tuscan with Leon Battista and his brother, but until 1428 or, more certainly, 1434, Leon Battista was never immersed in a Tuscan-speaking environment. For the contrast between the language of the first and second books of the Della Famiglia, written in Rome, and the third book, written in Florence, and for Alberti's own reference to the significance of his presence in Florence for his own command of the vernacular, see ibid., p. 7. 15. P. F. Gehl, A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence (Ithaca, New York and London: Cornell University Press, 1993), pp. 27, 32-34, 102f., notes the status of Latin in the fourteenth century as a "second language" not mastered as fully as the vernacular. Nor did Latin have the rich expressive resources of the various dialects of Italy. Not surprisingly, by the early fifteenth century, Italian was beginning to usurp the position of Latin in certain contexts; in 1415, legislation was passed that all guild contracts should be in the volgare, as noted by J. Onians, "Brunelleschi: Humanist or Nationalist," Art History 5 (1982):263. But Onians makes too much of this: Latin continued to be the medium of instruction for all notaries, and the formularies that they used in drawing up cases were not translated. See Gehl (p. 37) on the persistence of the separation of the two linguistic realms "until well into the fifteenth century," though he also notes the expanding use of Italian in legal and other contexts formerly reserved for Latin. 16. Niccolo Della Luna called the certame a "spectaculo"; see Gorni, "Certame coronario" (see note 8), p. 12. 17. Mancini (see note 8), p. 193; M. Reeve, "Classical scholarship," in The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism, ed. J. Kraye (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 39, with further bibliography. The debate went back a long way: the founding text was perhaps Dante's De vulgari eloquentia, though significantly Dante wrote this in a curiale (courtly) idiom, that is, not in Florentine volgare, for which he would be criticized by Machiavelli. See A. M. Codevilla, "Words and Power," in N. Machiavelli, The Prince, trans. and ed. A. M. Codevilla, commentary by W. B. Allen (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1 997), p. xxii. Dante's position was that "language should be crafted to follow the dictates of reason, not of men or of chance." Such a prehumanist position contrasts sharply with that of Alberti, but not that of Brunelleschi, who shared the veneration of Dante characteristic of the Burchiello set. The evidence for Brunelleschi's "Dante scholarship" is well presented by E. Battisti, Filippo Brunelleschi: The Complete Work (New York: Electa, 1981), p. 320.</page><page sequence="4">42 RES 34 AUTUMN 1998 change, but especially under the impact of the Germanic languages spoken by various invaders in the turbulent centuries following the collapse of Roman imperial order. Even after the flowering of vernacular literature in fourteenth-century Florence, however, Tuscan still seemed in need of refinement to Alberti and those who shared his views. The almost obsessive polishing Alberti gave to his vernacular works of the 1430s, his Italian version of the celebrated treatise "On Painting" and the three books "On the Family" (to which his work "On Friendship," written for the certame, was appended as a fourth book), forms part of an attempt to develop an appropriately elegant, flexible, and needless to say latinate literary language.18 Indeed, the certame itself indicates that the binary distinction of Latin and the vernacular obscured the range of stylistic idioms and models available to those concerned with literary expression in their native language (much the same was also true, of course, of writing in Latin). It is possible that the certame jurors were more willing to recognize this diversity than Alberti, with his commitment-expressly stated in the preface to book three of the Della Famiglia-to a unitary linguistic regime, at least in the context of writing.19 Alberti's favored entry in the competition was almost certainly that of his friend and fellow papal bureaucrat Leonardo Dati, whose attempt to write Italian hexameters broke brusquely with local traditions of vernacular versification, which were upheld by most other competitors.20 The jurors were not impressed. Alberti's response is known from a highly polemical anonymous text known as the Protesta in which the author, certainly Alberti himself, represents the jury's decision as aroused by envy and as a scornful riposte to the organizer.21 Many scholars have rashly taken Alberti at his word, assuming that the blow of the failed certame was enough to drive Alberti to a mood of bleak pessimism and, a little later, to a return to Latin as his literary language of choice. The central themes of the Protesta appear in other of Alberti's writings, however, suggesting a concern not so much to represent a given state of affairs as to focus attention on general forces affecting human conduct. The author of the Protesta represents envy as the major force in play, and indeed Alberti proceeded to select envy as the theme of a second certame, which however never took place, though Dati and others wrote pieces for it.22 A more compelling reason to read the Protesta skeptically, however, is that it gives the highly implausible impression that only Alberti and the jurors had significant roles to play on this occasion.23 Whatever Alberti's reaction, it is surely far more likely that the award was first of all an act of flattery to the people of Florence and, in particular, the leading citizen who financed the event and, we may suppose, saw to it that the cathedral was made available. This was Piero di Cosimo de' Medici, elder son of the effective ruler of Florence since 1434. Piero's key role, along with his younger brother, in the cultural policies of the Medici has been emphasized and documented in many recent studies. There can be no doubt of the larger strategic purpose of his involvement in the events of 1441, while 18. Mancini (see note 8), pp. 230ff. 19. L. B. Alberti, I libri della famiglia, ed. R. Romano and A. Tenenti (Turin: Einaudi, 1969), pp. 185-1 89. Obviously such unity (a matter of the self-consciousness of Italians as a people) is distinct from the "ornaments," including the variety, expected of a literary discourse. Implicitly, if inconsistently, Alberti connects the discussion of language with the idea of a gendered domestic space; in antiquity, he notes that women spoke a purer Latin because less contaminated by linguistic usage outside the home (p.1 87). In his own culture, however, slaves (with whom women would come into contact) had great difficulty picking up correct Italian. In Alberti's perception, then, the health of the language and that of the household are closely intertwined and equally embattled. 20. R. Ristori, s.v.

The reason for the cancellation of the second certame is not known, and the opposition aroused by the first is often adduced in explanation. It is perhaps relevant, however, that Dati suffered some disgrace in late 1441 that blocked his career at the papal court at least until 1445. The nature of Dati's offense is not known, but it was perhaps scandalous enough to kill an event with which he was closely and conspicuously associated. See Ristori (see note 20), p. 47. 23. G.

Two events of 1440 had greatly affected both the standing of the Medici in the city and Piero's potential personal role. The victory of Anghiari suppressed major external as well as internal threats to the Medicean regime;25and Piero's uncle Lorenzo, younger brother and close partner of Cosimo de' Medici, died, leaving a clear opportunity and even need for the members of the younger generation to establish themselves in the political and cultural affairs of the city.26 The commission at this time of formal portraits of Piero and his brother was surely accomplished in part to emphasize their new status.27 In Piero's case, at least, a portrait was perhaps necessary because he was not well known in Florence. He had not returned to Florence with his father in 1434 but had stayed on in northern cities and courts, notably Venice and Ferrara. In Ferrara he had encountered the highly influential pedagogy of the famous humanist Guarino da Verona, and it was probably in the circle around Guarino that Piero and Alberti became acquainted.28 A third crucial event of 1440, however, was the accession of Leonello d'Este as Duke of Ferrara. Leonello, whose education had been entrusted to Guarino, did not disappoint his tutor's expectations and quickly took steps to make Ferrara a center of the evolving culture of humanism, though with a distinctly courtly inflection. Leonello was not slow to support innovative work in the visual arts, favoring competitive procedures. Soon after his accession, he commissioned Jacopo Bellini and Pisanello, in rivalry, to produce portraits of him, roughly contemporary with the portrait of Piero mentioned above. Bellini won the competition, but Pisanello stayed on in Ferrara to focus, in particular, on the production of all'antica medals that also satisfied the growing taste for personal devices. Alberti's close relations with Leonello and his court are well known (he dedicated the Teogenio to Leonello29); his own portrait medal with accompanying device seems closely related to Pisanello's experiments of the early 1 440s, while he himself claimed that Leonello had commissioned-or at least provided the stimulus for-his writings on architecture.30 Unlike Leonello, Piero de' Medici did not have to wait for his father's death to assume an active role in cultural patronage. By 1444 construction began on a grand new palace to house Cosimo's branch of the Medici family, though not the descendants of his brother Lorenzo. Piero was centrally involved with this project, 24. Cosimo apparently thought a lot about envy; see S. McKillop, "Dante and Lumen Christi: A Proposal for the Meaning of the Tomb of Cosimo de' Medici," in Cosimo 'il Vecchio' de' Medici 1389-1464, ed. F. Ames-Lewis (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 260ff., quoting both Vespasiano da Bisticci and Machiavelli. See also W.

Envy was also a particular concern of Alberti; see Mancini (see note 8), p. 148. 25. On the battle of Anghiari, see N.

The Florentine forces overcame a Milanese army, associated, as usual on such occasions, with Florentine fuorusciti. The leading Florentine exile hoping to return to a position of power within the city with foreign help was Rinaldo degli Albizzi. His defeat marked the end of serious internal opposition to the Medici regime for over a decade. 26. A.

The Gothic character of the cupola is striking to modern observers, but Quattrocento humanists lacked a critical vocabulary and categorical framework adequate to articulate discriminations between the style of the cathedral and that, say, of the Pantheon.35 It is out of the question, then, that the jurors of 1441 saw the cathedral in general or the cupola in particular as an example of "1vernacular style" in architecture, along the lines of vernacular literature. They were, after all, members of the papal secretariat and participants in the great Church council; they were therefore perhaps less responsive to the cathedral's local functions and connotations than to its glorious role as the festive setting for the proclamation of the unity of the eastern and western churches, in the presence of the pope and patriarch. If only temporarily, Santa Maria del Fiore had served both as the center and, it would seem, an appropriate symbol of a redefined Christendom. Even if no specific connection was made between the cathedral architecture and specifically vernacular expression, the award of a literary prize to the cathedral implied a more fundamental association, that between the architecture of the cathedral or even architecture in general-and verbal expression, at least of a suitably lofty idiom, opening a range of possibilities for the interanimation of diverse cultural domains. This was nothing new, however, for when Florence cathedral was (re)consecrated in 1436 by Eugenius IV, following the completion of the cupola, the event had required and generated verbal performances of various kinds. A notable response was the speech delivered by Gianozzo Manetti at the consecration, including a eulogy of the building itself that, as C. W. Westfall has shown, in many respects anticipates his famous description of Nicholas V's project for St. Peter's.36 Manetti's eulogy of the cathedral was written, of course, in an elevated humanist Latin, which may well have seemed to him the only language appropriate to such a task. There are other important reasons why the cathedral architecture might not have been associated specifically with vernacular expression. Brunelleschi's cathedral cupola completed an ensemble of structures of which one, the Baptistry, was accepted as ancient, not 31. This goes back to Gombrich's flat assertion of a division of labor between Cosimo and his sons, the former reserving for himself "the royal art of architecture"; see E. H.

The author of the Protesta Alberti himself or someone very close to the certame-claims to write on behalf of the people of Florence, a formulation that recalls Alberti's offer of his treatise On Friendship to the "senate and people" of the city.39 It is impossible to miss Alberti's implicit opposition of the learned elite and the solid citizenry with values rooted in family and civic tradition, the kind of men portrayed so sympathetically in his dialogs of the 1430s. In any case, Alberti planned a further certame, this time dedicated to the theme of envy. The initiative failed, in part because of scornful opposition by influential humanists, notably Bruni, who suggested that stupidity would be a more appropriate theme.40 Alberti, however, had already taken sides. In his preface of 1436 to the Della Pittura, he explicitly champions Brunelleschi, who, as Giovanni Tanturli has shown, suffered the neglect or even disdain of the humanist community until his posthumous effusive rehabilitation, while the earliest recognition of his individual achievement, as opposed to the cathedral as a communal undertaking, came from vernacular circles, specifically the notary Domenico da Prato.41 Brunelleschi's witty disparagement of the acid tongued humanist Niccolo Niccoli was, in Tanturli's view, revealing of his general attitude. This may also explain the absence of any recorded response on his part to the certame, which is not mentioned in Manetti's biography.42 Unfortunately, as a result, we can hardly even make a plausible guess regarding Brunelleschi's estimation of the certame in particular or Alberti in general. Brunelleschi, born in 1377, belonged to an earlier generation than Alberti, born in 1404, and there is no reason to assume close relations between them in the relatively brief period (Brunelleschi died in 1446) that this would have been possible. On the other hand, they shared a friendship with the prominent mathematician Toscanelli, who was interested in mechanics and in technical problems involving the practical application of mathematical knowledge. Significantly, Brunelleschi's work on the cupola was consistently described and praised, not least by Alberti himself in 1436, as a technical rather than an architectural achievement.43 Perhaps Alberti's estimation of Brunelleschi was after all not so different from that of other humanists. Alberti's explicit interest in Brunelleschi's architecture coincided, on the other hand, with his exploration of the literary possibilities of the Florentine vernacular, which led him into contact with a circle of acquaintances distinct from and consciously opposed to the humanists.44 In the early 1430s, a group interested in the expressive possibilities of the local vernacular met in the premises of the leading figure among them, the barber Burchiello, who plied his trade in the Via Calimaruzza, just off the Piazza della Signoria. Burchiello was a noted practitioner of an exaggerated, 37. Onians (see note 15), p. 264, rather recklessly denies that anyone other than a few humanists thought of the Baptistry as ancient. This is to ignore the weight of political symbolism and ideological constructions associated with the city's supposed Roman origin that were widely diffused among the Florentine population, though certainly manipulated by the elite on occasion.

The exchange of poems between Giovanni and Brunelleschi indicates that even if the former was Brunelleschi's nemesis, the two men, both great admirers of Dante (Giovanni da Prato lectured on Dante at the Florentine university), sparred and fought within the same mental or at least literary universe.47 Indeed, there is evidence that Brunelleschi authored certain well-known and pungent compositions in the vernacular and, further, that he was at home in the contentious milieu of Burchiello, in which few punches were pulled.48 But can we imagine the elusive figure of Alberti among the sharp wits and razors of Burchiello's shop, where we know his friend and literary collaborator Leonardo Dati was sometimes to be found?49 The overlap between Alberti and the barber was in any case brief. Burchiello left Florence in 1434, apprehensive of the consequences of turning the sharp edge of his invective against the Medici, whose treatment of potential rivals he despised, and apparently fearing his outspokenness might even cost him his life.50 There are striking allusions to Burchiello's rash and vehement opposition to the Medici in an exchange of verses with none other than Alberti, presumably written very soon after the Medicean coup of 1434, perhaps the year of Alberti's own return.51 In his sonnet, Alberti counsels the exasperated barber to moderate his language or end badly. Style and language ally Alberti with Burchiello and his friends probably including Brunelleschi, whose relations with the Medici were cool-but the content asserts distance from their political views or rather, perhaps, from the vehement espousal of any political view. Nevertheless, the Florentine Burchiello surely occupies a place of honor among the satirists, notably the ancient Greek Lucian, who inspired Alberti to indulge his own parodic and sardonic vein, especially in the Momus, written in a humanistic Latin no less grand than that of the roughly contemporary De re aedificatoria but, however subtly, subjecting the papal court or any court-to savage satire.52 Alberti's final work in the vernacular before leaving Florence in 1443 was the dialog Profugiorum de aerumnis, usually dated in the year following the certame. This includes an extended passage in which, as Christine Smith has pointed out, Alberti himself employs the cupola not only as the setting of an imagined conversation, but also as a metaphor for the soul to illustrate a central theme of the work, the blessedness of a calm space untroubled by the vicissitudes of the world.53 The passage echoes the evocation in the De re aedificatoria of the sanctuary of a temple as a place entirely suffused with philosophy (a term that, when used by Alberti, is always laden with Stoic ethical values) and where architecture, rather than painting or 45.

However, these included a particular enthusiasm for Dante, which we know was shared both by Brunelleschi and, much later, by his biographer, Antonio Manetti, whose visual reconstruction of Dante's infernal topography and architecture surely derives from a current of discussion and speculation to which Brunelleschi contributed.55 Moreover, Alberti's evocation of the cathedral as a Stoic soul resonates with the lively late-medieval tradition of allegorical architecture, which, as it happens, is especially prominent in vernacular poetry and which Dante developed in his great vernacular poem.56 In the profugiorum ab aerumnis, then, Alberti drew on and enriched a theme in vernacular culture that perhaps already in 1441 informed responses to the cathedral, even on the part of the certame jury. In any case, it is evident that Alberti brought both technical and moral concerns to bear in his early meditations on architecture and even in his own early exercises in architectural design. In the Profugiorum ab aerumnis, he recounts his own experiments in architectural design and even "construction," conducted in his imagination, he says, to assuage insomnia occasioned by excitement of mind and associated with consideration of mathematical problems, especially those of some practical relevance.57 The latter category presumably includes experiments in the graphic representation of architecture, possibly working out the implications of the architectural innovations current in the Florentine milieu of the early 1440s. Still, there is a considerable distance from a literary and ethical discourse that uses architectural examples and analogies, however centrally, to an architecture-or the conception of an architecture that itself assumes the expression and communication of fundamental ethical and cultural values. This is the crucial step taken with the De re aedificatoria, written following Alberti's departure from Florence in 1443 and his transfer to a more exclusively latinate milieu. The concern with clarity of exposition in the language of the treatise itself, however, and the author's explicit concern with the possibilities of architecture as a vehicle of ethical motivation and stimulus indicate the persistence of themes shaped by Alberti's exposure and responses to a range of linguistic practices and architectural idioms in the 1430s and early 1440s. The evident appeal in the treatise to patrons, rather than to such architects as existed at the time, clearly evokes the relations Alberti enjoyed in the early 1440s with aristocratic amateurs and future patrons of architecture such as Piero de' Medici and Leonello d'Este.58 By now, Alberti was not only a literary man of some reputation, but also an advisor and confidant of princes and public figures. Such a role was surely confirmed by Piero de' Medici's sponsorship of the certame. III A central theme in recent, self-consciously innovative accounts of early Renaissance architecture is the contrast between Brunelleschi and Alberti (figs. 1-2), whatever the latter's debt to the former. Some see the contrast in terms of a version of an opposition between Brunelleschi's adherence to medieval models, however rationalized, and Alberti's classicism: an opposition, in other words, of a vernacular Brunelleschi and a latinate and often aulic Alberti, who after all largely both wrote about architecture and produced designs for and at princely courts.59 The conception of a medieval 54.

Brunelleschi hardly does justice to his radical rationalism, though it is certainly true that Brunelleschi was rooted in the intense civic and corporate world of late-medieval Florence, as Diane Zervas above all has demonstrated. Brunelleschi's place in such a milieu and, in the longer view, the milieu itself were placed in question, however, by external factors, notably, as Zervas has shown, his exclusion from political office following the Medici coup.60 No less disruptive to the institutional structures among which Brunelleschi flourished, on the other hand, were his own repeated challenges to the status quo in the name of individual artistic and/or administrative control. Although there is no explicit mention of Brunelleschi in the De re aedificatoria, Alberti leaves no doubt that he recognized the significance of his achievement, not only for the emergence of a new formal language of architecture, but also-more radical still-for the inauguration of a new epoch in the design process and in the professional status of the architect. In my view, Brunelleschi's approach to architecture was indeed medieval in crucial respects and as such differed drastically from that of Alberti. For all the documented engagement of Brunelleschi with vernacular culture, however, a characterization of the difference between Brunelleschi and Alberti as that between vernacular and classical or learned forms of expression would be erroneous. Alberti, of course, moved between vernacular and classical models and (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana, 1960), p. 710. Burns's characterization of Alberti's architectural classicism can be now usefully read through the prism of a postmodernist conception of Alberti's literary classicism; see A.

More importantly, however, Brunelleschi's architecture cannot be understood in terms of any aspect of vernacular usage, but rather in terms of a domain of Latin usage and latinate culture outside Alberti's experience, both by virtue of the milieus in which he moved and in the wake of larger historical shifts. This specific latinate culture, which in general was slow to embrace the exotic-and sometimes alarmingly erotic predilections of humanism, was grounded in pedagogical and professional structures and processes that constituted a significant aspect of Brunelleschi's formative environment but were already in retreat by the time of Alberti's sojourn in Florence. It was shaped by the formalization and systematization of linguistic usage through grammar, and of human behavior and interaction through legal provisions and prescriptions. The links between grammar and law were close, since grammatical instruction-the "grammar school" was a necessary prelude to the most accessible level of the legal profession, the notariate. But notarial writing-still largely in Latin-depended on models of usage and assumptions about language itself that were widely diffused in late-medieval urban societies and ultimately depended on scholastic models and styles of explanation that, at least in Italy, soon withered with the victory of humanism. As Ian Maclean has pointed out, moreover, Renaissance legal theorists often devoted extended introductory discussions to the theme of grammar, with the evident awareness that traditional grammar was not conceived in terms "ideal for their purposes." 61 In the intensely litigious climate of late-medieval Florence, notaries were ubiquitous and indispensable. Of the "greater guilds" that controlled republican Florence, preeminence was traditionally assigned to the Guild of Judges and Notaries (Giudici e Notai). Notaries formed by far the larger contingent within the guild, and recent studies have emphasized the importance of notaries in every aspect of the life of the city. Judges tended to be doctors of law and hailed from a higher social milieu than most notaries. Many notaries also attended university, however, though often not so much for legal as for rhetorical training, especially as humanism filtered through the culture.62 Certainly, some major early humanists were notaries, notably the first humanist chancellor of Florence, Coluccio Salutati, and all his successors-including Leonardo Bruni, Poggio Bracciolini, and Carlo Marsuppini-until the appointment of the doctor of law Benedetto Accolti in 1458 set a new precedent.63 Unlike Salutati or Bruni, the Florentine notariate was predominantly native to the city and wholly or largely trained within its walls. The evidence bears out an early-fifteenth-century observation that Florence was the source of notaries just as Bologna was the source of doctors of law.64 The son of a prominent notary, Brunelleschi was born in 1 377, one year before the appointment of Salutati as chancellor.65 His family situation guaranteed his absorption, in his youth, in a distinctively notarial culture, in the apt phrase of Peter Burke.66 Among the known habitues of Burchiello's barbershop salon, there were many notaries, notably Domenico da Prato, identified by Tanturli as the first to give literary 61.

Such skills were perhaps invaluable in the sophisticated but-at least in literary formats unarticulated patterns of urban design recently reconstructed by Friedman and Trachtenberg.68 The "notarial culture" of late-medieval Florence was grounded in patterns of education and professional preparation that presupposed certain fundamental habits of thought and cognitive frameworks. I have discussed elsewhere the shift from a prehumanist notarial culture, associated with oligarchic republicanism and the beginnings of civic humanism, to an increasingly centralized and consensual political culture marked by ultimately Platonizing conceptions of legitimacy, and with far-reaching implications for the built environment.69 Here I wish to focus on shifting notions of the nature of language or at least on practices symptomatic of such shifts, especially with regard to the formulation and communication of rules for language learning and prose composition. We have looked at the complex relationship of both Brunelleschi and Alberti to the issue of literary expression in the vernacular, and at Alberti's project for its reform. Although comfortably immersed in a rich and frequently combative vernacular culture, Brunelleschi, as an architect, implemented a radically reductive and rationalist method that cannot be associated with his specifically vernacular background. Indeed, there is a noteworthy contrast between his insistence on authorship in his work as architect or technical expert and the fluidity of authorial designation in the early history of the famous Tale of the Fat Carpenter, generally attributed to Brunelleschi.70 Brunelleschi's technical and mathematical interests are clearly part of the story, but the most compelling accounts of his method point to his concern with developing an architectural syntax or grammar (terms that recur with some frequency, though without exploration of their implications).71 Implicitly, such studies introduce a reference to architecture not just as language as a communicative practice, but as a discipline organized analogously to language and anchored in a structure a "grammar" underlying and enabling all forms of verbal enunciation. For late twentieth-century readers, such a distinction irresistibly recalls the semiology of de Saussure and his followers, but it was also anticipated in medieval thinking about language and in the institutional matrix and purposes of second-language acquisition. For Brunelleschi, in my view, the Latin of notarial culture provided a foundation, if not indeed a model, for the elaboration of a reformed architecture as an analogous and no less rigorous case of a "language" anchored by a grammar. Late-medieval notarial culture was formed and maintained by a deeply rooted system of pedagogy. Notaries received their instruction, for the most part, in grammar school. Although many notaries advanced their careers by adopting more or less classical Latin, it was general practice to rely on formularies, the artes dictaminis used in fairly standardized form all over Latin Europe.72 In many ways these were simple handbooks to be mined for forms of 67.

At the beginning of his article, "Prima del Brunelleschi: verso un'architettura sintattica e prospettica," Palladio, ser. 3, 27 (1 978):47-76, Arnaldo Bruschi identifies four fundamental principles of Brunelleschi's architecture: perspectival organization, proportion, uniformity of both simple and compound elements, and the syntactic association of "lexical" elements in an integrated design ("sintatticita"). Bruschi gives particular emphasis to the last, which he claims has been relatively neglected in previous scholarship. In a related article of the same year, to which I am much indebted, Bruschi contrasts the basic principles of Brunelleschi's and Alberti's architecture; see "Note sulla formazione architettonica dell'Alberti," Palladio, ser. 3, 25 (1 978):6-44. Here Bruschi argues that though Brunelleschi may have used elements of ancient derivation, his design method is largely new and anchored in medieval rather than ancient culture (he doesn't specify architecture) (p. 33). This is absolutely right but raises the question of where in medieval culture to locate the source or origin both of Brunelleschi's specific method and of his conception of method or methodicity as such. 72.

Their use enabled and encouraged, as Paul Grendler points out, the production of formal letters emphasizing harmonious relationships between members of a social hierarchy.73 Grendler finds correspondence of this type, even between friends, depersonalized and lacking emotion and meditation on personal affairs. Humanists found an excellent model for such writing in the letters of Cicero ad familiares, which indeed were to become an important textbook in the humanist pedagogical regime that quickly cut a swathe in early-fifteenth-century Italy.74 We can also now see why Alberti's discussion of friendship, though couched in the vernacular, in fact represented as much a challenge to the prevailing "notarial culture" as any magniloquent display of Ciceronian Latin. Implicit within the simplest formularies was a theory of grammar that resonated with medieval doctrine about the nature of language as taught and discussed at major universities. Grendler has aptly characterized the ars dictaminis as exemplifying "the typical medieval tendency to organize and classify an intellectual activity according to logical and hierarchical principles." A corollary of this is "the preference for preceptive method based on rules rather than on imitation, which was favored by humanists." Grendler relates this to the favor shown by fourteenth century grammarians to speculative grammar, "an attempt to base language on a logic of meaning." Speculative grammar was so called because it adhered to a conception of grammar as a mirror (speculum) of the structure of the universe.75 Its practitioners were known as modistae through their use of the term modus to characterize links between existence, understanding, and language. "In speculative grammar, the structure of reality is the ultimate foundation of grammar. Real things exist and possess various qualities or modes of being. Words are surface manifestations of reality and reflect the way the mind comprehends reality." This linking of grammar to reality entailed a rigid conception of language that was no more congenial to humanists than, in the late twentieth century, structuralist accounts of deep grammars have been to postmodern critics. Grendler's characterization of speculative grammar serves remarkably well as an analytical description of Brunelleschi's architecture. This is a stripped-down, hierarchical system of elements-akin to the membri e osse discerned by Brunelleschi, according to his biographer, in the remains of Roman architecture76 arrayed in a rationally regulated and ordered space and marking out a bounded volume within it. The Brunelleschian architectural syntax (for which, significantly, the technical term was constructio)77 is Studies in the Theory and Practice of Medieval Rhetoric, ed. J. J.

On the other hand, the letters of early-fifteenth-century Florentine humanists clearly indicate the adoption of new protocols of letter writing, as in the cases of Ambrogio Traversari or Poggio Bracciolini. On humanist primers on letter writing, see Kristeller (see note 72), p. 10. 75. Because of its obvious resonances with modern theories of universal grammar (Chomsky, etc.), there has been considerable recent interest in the modistae, as is pointed out by G. L.

Manetti reports of Brunelleschi's architectural studies in Rome that "parvegli conoscere un certo ordine di membri e d'ossa." In Manetti (see note 48), p. 65 n. 1, Giovanni Tanturli suggests that this formulation is derived from Alberti's use of anatomical analogies, especially involving "bones" and "ligaments," in the De re aedificatoria; see the appendix on "Bones and paneling" in Rykwert, Tavernor, and Leach (see note 2), p. 421. But Alberti generally uses this language to refer to structural properties of walls and roofs that are largely covered by a "skin" or surface treatment; in other words, he describes the typical Roman method of building with concrete reinforced by brick masonry. This is very different from the visible membering of Brunelleschi's architecture, or indeed from Alberti's own, somewhat inconsistent reference to columns as bones at De re aedificatoria IX.5 (Rykwert, Tavernor, and Leach [see note 2], p. 303; Orlandi and Portoghesi [see note 2], vol. 2, pp. 81 8/81 9). Significantly, Alberti refers here to Nature, not antiquity, as the model. I believe, then, that Manetti recalls Brunelleschi's, not Alberti's, way of characterizing architectural membering, one applied by the former to his own principle of architectural design for which, perhaps, he claimed ancient precedent. 77.

C rarmar and expression in early Renaissance architecture 53 composed of highly uniform and regular elements linked together in a systematic and coherent articulation that seems to conform to and embody transcendent principles of the ordering of things, exactly on the lines of the linguistic elements that mirror, in modistic theory, the structure of reality. It was not only an aesthetic concern that led Brunelleschi to negate walls as constituent elements of architecture, as he did already, if not entirely successfully, in the Old Sacristy.78 The question arises, however, of the knowledge of or interest in modistic theory in late-medieval Florence. After all, speculative grammar emerged and flourished in the scholastic environment of Northern European schools, though Bologna quickly became a leading center.79 As is often noted, in Italy the stress was always more on rhetorical performance than on logical analysis, especially with the diffusion of humanist priorities and principles. Nevertheless, the impact of modistic theory in Italy was far from negligible, and its traces in Italian intellectual culture have been acknowledged especially by Grendler, who demonstrates that significant features of philosophical grammar survived well into the fifteenth century, even in the writings on grammar of certain leading humanists, like Guarino.80 Grendler does not directly address the situation in Florence. The teaching of grammar in late-medieval Florence has been the focus of recent scholarly attention, most notably that of Paul Gehl, who has written extensively on the early stages of pedagogical initiation into Latin.81 In addition to its obvious practical significance, Gehl argues for the cultural importance of latinization in the production of a new kind of subject, formed through the moral messages contained in many of the texts but even more through the acquisition of Latin itself. Bilingualism not only gave students a different, more self-conscious apprehension of vernacular linguistic expression; more importantly, as Gehl emphasizes, it introduced them, for the first time, to grammatical analysis, which in itself was thought to have moral value.82 Perhaps because of his emphasis on the moral rather than epistemological dimension of his subject, Gehl does not mention speculative grammar as such. He points out that grammar was a matter both of elementary instruction-his particular concern-and of university education, without addressing the nature of the latter or its relationship to the former.83 However, he outlines a two-step pedagogical process in elementary schooling, in which students moved from basic handbooks to primers on syntax (constructio). Such primers did not explicitly address or embody modistic theory, though they clearly shared certain basic assumptions of the modistae. I have found no specific evidence that engagement with such primers led in exceptional cases to an interest in philosophical grammar, but this would have been a reasonable course for students concerned about the philosophical as opposed to the moral legitimation of a cultural process that guaranteed both professional opportunity and access to-indeed the instrumentalization of-a foundational ontological realm but was already endangered by new cultural developments and their institutional implications.84 Medieval Linguistic Thought, ed. K. Koerner, H. J. Niederle, and R. H. Robins (Amsterdam and Philadelphia: Benjamins, 1980), pp. 231-240. Robins stresses the retention by Renaissance grammarians of many features of medieval syntactic analysis (e.g., the relationship of government of one part by another), in spite of their rejection of the philosophical framework (p. 237). 78. Volker Hoffmann convincingly identifies the probable source of this approach to architectural design in the canopylike, that is, wall less, structures represented in the mosaics in the Baptistry, as well as in the membering of that building itself, the symbol and embodiment of a continuous tradition of Florentine romanitas. See V. Hoffmann, "L'origine del sistema architettonico del Brunelleschi," in Filippo Brunelleschi: la sua opera e il suo tempo, ed. Pina Ragionieri (Florence: Centro Di, 1980), vol. 1, pp. 447-457. 79. Marmo (see note 75), pp. 5-12, lists the major modistae and their writings. Leading figures based at Bologna include Gentile da Cingoli and Angelo d'Arezzo. 80. Grendler (see note 72), p. 165. M. Becker, Civility and Society in Western Europe (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1 988), p. 1 75 n. 20, relates the persistence of speculative grammar to that of etymology, which was grounded in a belief that "words reflected reality in their composition." He notes that even Salutati was slow to abandon etymological thinking. 81. Gehl (see note 1 5), esp. pp. 82-106. Gehl's emphasis on the moral aspect of grammar teaching-against the background, once again, of historiographical debate about the emergence and diffusion of "civic humanism"-inhibits consideration of what might be called the epistemological dimension of the cultural practices Gehl discusses. Gehl's work is philologically outstanding, but methodologically circumscribed. 82. Ibid., pp. 102-1 04. 83. Gehl, ibid., p. 229, notes a distinction between writing masters and grammar teachers. The latter were more respectable, no doubt because writing masters often taught (in) the vernacular, while grammar enjoyed the prestige both of the Latin language and of the background of grammatical theory. The "marginalization of Latin grammatical study" is a major theme of Gehl, ibid., e.g., p. 232. 84.

A key text was a handbook written circa 1418 by Guarino da Verona, the Regulae grammaticales, distinguished less by the active adoption of a new methodology than by the employment of classical terminology and by a reductive presentation of the material.86 After all, it was a tenet of humanism, even if unarticulated at first, that grammatical study was only a required step, as brief as possible, toward full engagement with a language in the texts themselves.87 This is the position represented by Alberti himself in the Della Famiglia, in which he recommends the pedagogical use of selected works on grammar, but only ancient ones and then only as long as it takes until a student can tackle literary and historical masterpieces.88 Typically, for humanists, it was usage that mattered; indeed, in itself grammar was utterly trivial, certainly in contrast to the elucidation and illustration of a literary language, as in Lorenzo Valla's Libri elegantiarum linguae latinae, which includes an unusually explicit and blistering polemic against medieval grammar and in which Valla perhaps took the radical step to a conventional view of language.89 Not long before he produced his grammar, Guarino da Verona had spent some years in Florence, where he remained well known. His pedagogy, aiming at the production of well-rounded gentlemen of broad cultural interests and expertise, may have had a particular effect on Piero de' Medici, who may have been his student and would certainly have been acquainted with the man and his ideas through Leonello d'Este.90 Grendler relates the new ideas about the teaching of grammar to the development of classicizing script types by Florentine intellectuals, notably Niccolo Niccoli, cast by Vespasiano and others as a paradigmatic connoisseur and collector of antiquities.91 In a famous essay, Ernst Gombrich claims that the research of Niccoli and others into ancient Roman epigraphy and their interest in its adaptive revival inspired and directed the "reform of the arts." 92 Gombrich separates currents in artistic expression from social and ideological tendencies, a separation that can hardly be upheld in this case in the light of Tanturli's demonstration of the particular disdain of Niccoli for artifices (artisans) and in particular for Brunelleschi, an attitude characteristic of humanism in general, at least until Brunelleschi's death.93 No direct connection 85.

Pinburg (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 808-81 6; Jensen (see note 74), p. 66. Percival distinguishes three phases in the development of grammatical writing from the mid fourteenth to the end of the fifteenth century. The first is the survival of medieval characteristics; the second involves tentative innovation but without explicit reflection on the changes being made (as in the case of Guarino); the third, embodied especially by Lorenzo Valla, involves not just explicit but even vehement antagonism to medieval grammar. Valla's approach was perhaps too radical to gain early acceptance; the first grammarian to follow Val la's lead was Giovanni Sulpizio Verulano, editor of the first printed text of Vitruvius (see below). 86. Jensen (see note 74), p. 66. 87. Ibid., p. 71. 88. Alberti counsels the learning of grammar from Priscian and Servius, before moving to Cicero, Livy, and Sallust; see Alberti (see note 19), p. 86; cf. Watkins (see note 14), p. 82. Alberti notes, interestingly, that Cicero himself was educated by a family friend who was also a distinguished jurist; see Alberti (see note 19), p. 66. 89. Jensen (see note 74), p. 69, cites a sixteenth-century distinction between the teaching of grammar and the teaching of language, leading to the claim that students of language had long been badly served by subjection to too much of the latter. Jensen shows how this attitude, perhaps less trenchantly expressed, can be traced back into the early fifteenth century.

It is significant, however, that the editor of the first printed version of Vitruvius (Rome, circa 1486), Sulpizio da Veroli, was also the author of an important, somewhat polemical early humanist grammar (written circa 1485). Sulpizio also produced a verse guide to table manners, marked by an almost Albertian linking of concerns with conduct and with aesthetic and social form.94 Alberti's position vis-a-vis both the humanist and vernacular literary movements of 1430s Florence was cautious. Already before his arrival in Florence, he had made a name for himself in humanist circles for his production of a Latin comedy that could and did pass for an ancient text. Alberti developed his literary inclinations during.and at the expense of his university studies. Nevertheless, he completed the curriculum at the University of Bologna, the most prestigious law school on the peninsula, with a degree in canon law.95 His legal training facilitated his entry into the papal chancery and provided the basis for a little-known work, De iure (On Law/lJustice), of 1437.96 The question of the relevance of Alberti's study of law for his various intellectual projects is complicated by the emergence, at least from the early fifteenth century, of humanist legal theory. As in other fields, humanists studied legal codes and systems as the products of particular historical moments and focused attention on the recovery of early or even original legal texts.97 Alberti himself lamented the prolixity of contemporary legal codes in contrast to the few but powerful laws of the early Romans the Twelve Tables.98 His position in the De iure and elsewhere is more clearly governed by his interest in justice as the humane, rational, and appropriate exercise of judgment in relation to human conduct on the basis of fundamental moral principles. Alberti's architectural theory is caught in just such an oscillation between historicizing and abstract conceptions of a field of study involving legislation in a double sense, both as the recognition of regularities in natural process and human conduct and, based on these, as the elaboration of prescriptive norms.99 Alberti's concern, whether in the sphere of language or in that of architecture, was never with inherent principles or-in a narrow sense "laws" governing usage, but rather with the elaboration of a flexible, expressive, and "gracious" public style capable of producing appropriately edifying and conciliatory effects. This is the gist of an extended passage on education in the Della Famiglia, in which he stresses his opposition to durezza, a rigidity of approach, that can manifest itself in a range of social practices and communicative forms.100 Whatever Alberti brought to his moral philosophical and architectural studies from his own legal training, humanist reconceptualization of the law was beginning to have an impact on legal education. A powerful echo of this was heard in Ferrara, where soon after his accession in 1440, Alberti's friend and patron Leonello d'Este reformed the university. In particular, he recruited well-known legists to the faculty but set them alongside representatives of the new learning, including moral philosophy, in a constellation of disciplinary fields that recalls Alberti's intellectual interests in the late 1430s and early 1440s.101 A version of the story, in which Niccoli's tormenter is not named, is told by the humanist Guarini, who spent some time in Florence as a teacher of Greek. The architect is named only in a vernacular version of the story. 94. For the Vitruvius edition and Sulpizio's place in the humanist circle around Pomponio Leto, see L. Marcucci, "Giovanni Sulpicio e la prima edizione del De Architectura di Vitruvio," Studi e documenti di architettura 8 (1 978):1 85-1 95; on his other activities, see Jensen (see note 74), pp. 71 f. 95.

An important monument of this tendency was A. Fiocchi, De magistratibus sacerdotibusque Romanorum, written in 1443, cited by H. Muhlmann, Asthetische Theorie der Renaissance: Leon Battista Alberti (Bonn: Habelt, 1 981), p. 61. Muhimann suggests that Fiocchi's legal studies and Alberti's architectural studies proceeded from similar presuppositions and perhaps in contact with each other. As a papal secretary, Fiocchi, who died in 1452, would have been known to Alberti. 98. Ibid., p. 92. 99.

Indeed, the succession of regimes in Ferrara appears to have provided a model for Alberti's distinction in the De re aedificatoria between a city ruled by a tyrant and one ruled by a benevolent prince, which is closely related to the further distinction between the residences appropriate to each. Alberti's conception of the house of a leading citizen in a free state is articulated at great length in terms that irresistibly recall, as Tonnesmann has recently clarified, the Florentine Palazzo Medici.102 IV If any secular fifteenth-century Florentine building expresses Albertian principles, it is the Palazzo Medici (fig. 3). The possibility of an Albertian involvement in the design has already been entertained by Isabel Hyman, though apparently without effect on more recent scholarship.103 The orthodox position was that the architect Michelozzo elaborated the design for his long standing patron Cosimo de' Medici, whose own contribution to the design process is usually assumed to have been substantial. This position appeared unassailable until Brenda Preyer launched a bravura attack on it, restoring to the center of the discussion the question of a Brunelleschi project for the palace, which Cosimo allegedly turned down as far too grand ("troppo suntuosa e grande").104 The story does not appear in Manetti's biography of Brunelleschi (which is incomplete) or in any other fifteenth-century source.105 Its earliest appearance is in Antonio Billi's early-sixteenth-century, widely diffused compilation of notes on and references to earlier works of art and artists.106 In view of the date of Billi's book, many scholars have dismissed the story as apocryphal. An immediate problem is the apparent inconsistency between Cosimo's rejection of a magnificent scheme and the all too obvious magnificence of the executed palace, which in turn has led scholars to see the construction of the palace as a crucial episode in the evolution of a new scale of values marked by the triumph of the Aristotelian virtue of magnificence.'107 Such a shift in patrician aesthetic attitudes and their ideological resonances, however, seems irreconcilable with the copiously documented ascetic stance of Cosimo himself, for which the story of the rejection of Brunelleschi's scheme provides only too convenient a confirmation. This opposition has been reconciled by the claim for a disjunction between a relatively sober exterior and a lavishly magnificent interior, giving striking physical expression to a generational divide between Cosimo and his sons, who had a far more relaxed attitude to the display of wealth, especially in the form of objects of rare workmanship and high artistic quality.108 But this requires an improbable reading of the story of Cosimo's rebuff to Brunelleschi, that is, that abstract issues the morality of in Civil Law, and Ludoviso Crivelli and Francesco Accolti in Canon Law. Accolti was evidently a friend of Alberti; in 1442 he contributed a poem on envy to the second certame. His official appointment at Ferrara was in 1450, but the document refers to many years of previous service. See Dizionario biografico degli Italiani 1 (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana, 1960), pp. 104f. On shifts in legal education in general, see Maclean (see note 61), pp. 13-20. 102.

Hyman raises the suggestion somewhat in passing, referring not to qualities of Alberti's approach to architectural design, but only to aspects of his conceptualization of palace architecture in the De re aedificatoria. 104. B. Preyer, "L'architettura del Palazzo Medici," in ll Palazzo Medici Riccardi di Firenze, ed. G. Cherubini and G. Fanelli (Florence: Giunti, 1990), pp. 58-75. 105. Hyman (see note 103), p. 105, notes that Manetti does assert that the signori of Florence and other cities clamored for Brunelleschi to design palaces as his fame spread. It is hard to see what palace builder in Florence would have qualified as a signore before Brunelleschi's death in 1446, if not Cosimo and Piero de' Medici. 106. P. Rubin, Giorgio Vasari: Art and History (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1994), pp. 173f., n. 125. Rubin emphasizes the number of versions in which Billi's notes appeared. This indicates that in Billi's own time, the story about the Brunelleschi project for the palace received wide credence. 107.

Far more plausible, because anchored in concrete circumstance, is the interpretation offered by Wolfger Bulst, who focuses attention on an inconspicuous little house constructed at about the same time as the palace on Medici land just to the north of the palace garden. The erection on this site of a grand structure would have provided a suitably magnificent end wall for the garden. Bulst suggests that the Medici deliberately refrained from this out of sensitivity to the concerns of neighbors, especially the Neroni family, whose residence adjoined the Medici land parcel on Borgo S. Lorenzo (now the Via dei Ginori).109 More generally, indeed, the palace as built shrank back from the Borgo, the main street of the quarter, leading out to the Porta San Gallo, as well as from the recently expanded piazza in front of San Lorenzo itself. Instead, the decision to front the palace onto the Via Larga, leading to sites closely associated with the Medici, revived or rather reinterpreted a medieval pattern of enclave formation.1 10 This may even have been a connotation of the marked effect of verticality and height of the palace in contrast to the major urban 109.

There is some truth in this, certainly, but it does not take into account the diversity-emphasized, for example, in Sinding-Larsen's analysis of rustication types in residential facades-of vernacular palace building.112 The most striking citation of a public building is that of the two-part windows with inscribed insignia, clearly reminiscent of the windows of the Palazzo della Signoria. In the mid-fifteenth century, however, such windows occur not only in residential architecture but also in ecclesiastical architecture, at least outside Florence.1"3 An important correspondence between the Palazzo Medici and the Palazzo della Signoria was the presence of a chapel, a standard element of a public hall or palace of justice, but unprecedented in the residential architecture of Florence.114 The lavish decoration of the chapel in the Medici palace is well known, but this perhaps impressed pious contemporaries less than the powerful charisma and sanctity conferred by the relics of Christ's Passion preserved in the chapel.115 The chapels of both buildings, moreover, shared a cult not only of the Virgin but also of St. Bernard of Clairvaux.116 A further possible echo of the Palazzo della Signoria in the palace is the cortile (fig. 4), though more overt spatial and formal correspondences connect the architecture and underlying geometry of the palace courtyard with a major religious building, San Lorenzo.'17 Indeed, the close resemblance between the palace courtyard and the interior of San Lorenzo not only suggests a common origin in a Brunelleschian scheme encompassing both buildings, but also establishes a visual sign of the sacrality inherent in the palace, which was soon echoed throughout the reception areas of the house, not least the courtyard and garden, in classicizing imagery that used ancient myth in a syncretic way to express moral and patriotic values.118 San Lorenzo was rebuilt, moreover, in a markedly neo-early Christian format allusive to the Constantinian basilica of St. Peter's, with which it shares the orientation of the facade to the east. The all'antica features of the palace have often been stressed, but both palace and church carried clear references to Rome, however subtly combined with local references.1 19 For all the correspondences of the church and the palace, the architecture of the latter-especially its facade-exhibits an interweaving of diverse stylistic and allusive registers into a highly unified architectural composition that goes far beyond the austerity of San Lorenzo. In its linguistic complexity and sophistication this is prima facie an Albertian (as well as Medicean) design solution that draws on but does not instantiate Brunelleschi's signature rigor and rationalism. In other words, the Palazzo Medici wraps an Albertian facade around a Brunelleschian core. More generally, however, as Tonnesmann has stressed, the palace corresponds typologically to conceptualizations, however concise, of I 1 1. Preyer (see note 104), p. 61. 1 12. S.

Hatfield notes the presence of St. Bernard in the chapel's altarpiece and speculates that Cosimo, not Piero, would have commissioned a painting with such express references to the virtue of humility. It is interesting that Hatfield's thesis opposes the Gombrichian notion of distinct spheres of interest on the part of father and son in the construction and decoration of the palace. I am speculating that there was a cult, as such, of St. Bernard in the Medici chapel; the main dedication was to the Trinity. 118. The evidence is assembled by Hyman (see note 103), pp. 122-127. M. T. Bartoli, "Le caratteristiche geometriche e numeriche di Palazzo Medici," in 11 Palazzo Medici Riccardi di Firenze, ed. G. Cherubini and G. Fanelli (Florence: Giunti, 1990), p. 77, finds a close relationship between the geometrical ordering of the Medici courtyard and that of the Palazzo Busini of about two decades earlier, which she unhesitatingly attributes to Brunelleschi. She does not doubt the attribution of the Medici palace to Michelozzo. In contrast, Preyer (see note 104) argues that Brunelleschi was responsible for the design not only of the courtyard, but even of the Medici palace as a whole.

Alberti is always assumed to have left Florence with the rest of the papal court in late 1443. The work on the palace began in earnest in 1444, though the work on San Lorenzo, which Hyman has shown was closely associated with the palace project, had been under way since 1441. If in fact Alberti returned to Rome in 1443, he was in Florence during the crucial period of discussions about the form and even site of the palace that Cosimo and his sons intended to build on the Via Larga. At that time, his chief interlocutor can only have been Piero de' Medici, with whom his relationship was by then long-standing, as Gunter Schweikhart demonstrates in a discussion of this specific topic.121 The crucial piece of evidence is Alberti's preface to an Italian version of the De re uxoria, addressed to Piero, in which he not only claims but also substantiates a close friendship between them. In particular, Alberti mentions Piero's close reading of his works, an obvious reference especially, as Schweikhart argues, to the De Pictura, which the art lover and bibliophile Piero assuredly had in his library.122 The association of the two men in the certame, then, was a natural expression of Piero's respect and support for Alberti's intellectual and critical acumen. Schweikhart assumes that Piero, who owned a Vitruvius manuscript, would have been privy to Alberti's developing meditations on architecture.' 23 The pressing question is whether Alberti would already have been in a position to offer compelling advice on the subject of architecture. In his review of the evidence for Alberti's early architectural knowledge, Bruschi collects the many references or allusions in the De Pictura to Vitruvius, though he stresses that these betray an interest primarily in ornament (significantly Bruschi opposes this to "the architectural grammar of antiquity," not yet absorbed by Alberti) and a conception of painting as the primary and dominant visual art.124 Nevertheless, there is considerable, though not unambiguous, evidence that by the early 1 450s Alberti had acquired a considerable reputation as an architectural expert. In the De re aedificatoria, Alberti claims to have acted as a technical consultant on the decayed Constantinian basilica of St. Peter's, which was consolidated and restored under Nicholas V.125 A Florentine chronicle represents Alberti as equipped with the authority to intervene and stop work on Pope Nicholas's project to rebuild at least the choir and crossing of St. Peter's.126 Whatever the truth of this account, it was certainly entirely credible at the time. This was not the first time Alberti had appeared as an arbiter in deliberations on a complex and highly visible artistic project. In 1441 in Ferrara, Alberti's friend Leonello d'Este relied on Alberti to review submissions for an equestrian monument to his father and predecessor as duke. Soon, of course, Alberti himself was almost certainly involved in the formulation of the design for the classicizing architectural base of the statue.127 Such a step from the assessment of others' work to direct involvement in design seems also to have occurred in Rome, though the evidence is far from conclusive. Alberti's involvement in the Ferrarese competition roughly coincided, of course, with the Florentine literary certame, in which, again, Alberti played two roles, as both author and organizer, significantly modeling his certame, in all probability, on a passage in Vitruvius's treatise.128 In Mantua, finally, at 120. Tonnesmann (see note 26), pp. 74f., refers specifically to De re aedificatoria V.6, Orlandi and Portoghesi (see note 2), vol. 1, p. 359.

Andrea.129 Antonio Billi's report of a Brunelleschian model for the Palazzo Medici provides a further case of the critical review of a project followed by an alternative design incorporating, as we saw, significant features of its predecessor. The structural correspondence between this case and others in which Alberti's intervention is documented is certainly not enough for proof of his active involvement here. If we accept Billi's account, we can surely assume that Alberti indeed played some role in deliberations about the palace, as long as we accept the further proposition that Piero was substantially involved in these, even though he was only 25 in 1441 and his documented involvement in architectural patronage started in 1445. Various evidence suggests that the hypothesis of an absolute division of labor between Cosimo and Piero in matters of patronage is not sustainable. Piero occupied and fitted out the main apartment of the new palace, directly behind the main facade; Cosimo didn't move out of the old Medici complex until 1456, and then he took the rear apartment overlooking the garden and the church square.130 With the death of Cosimo's younger brother in 1440, Cosimo became head of Lorenzo's immediate family, younger than his own. This may have been a factor in his tardy transfer into the new house. Piero, meanwhile, probably inherited some of Lorenzo's activities; in this context, Vasari's unfortunately unconfirmed account of Lorenzo's role as collector, especially of objets de luxe of markedly courtly flavor, is particularly suggestive.131 Finally, there is good evidence of Piero's early role as patron and connoisseur of paintings. In particular, he commissioned from Filippo Lippi works of particular importance in the earliest decoration of the palace.132 Around 1440, Lippi was developing an increasing interest in elaborate architectural backgrounds, emphasizing the effect of perspectival recession into virtual space, but also-at least in some cases suggesting a formal correspondence between fictive architecture represented in a painted scene and the architectural framing of the physical space in front of the painting. What was at stake, then, when in 1439-as a famous letter from the artist to Piero seems to indicate Piero rejected a painted altarpiece by Filippo Lippi? Did Piero want a more emphatic architectural background or even one that showed a greater grasp of architectural rationality-in figures as well as buildings-than Lippi had tended to display, but which he was certainly developing by the early 1440s? If so, did Piero turn to his learned friend Alberti for expert guidance in the judgment both of a painting and-in this case-of fictive architecture? The case of Lippi indicates that the judgment of paintings was also becoming the judgment of architecture, though not necessarily from a Brunelleschian perspective. Bruschi has emphasized the emergence of a rich and ornamented "sculptor's architecture," which he associates with Donatello, Ghiberti, and Michelozzo, but also with Alberti.133 It is an architecture capable not only of accommodating distinct types of heraldic and emblematic imagery but of itself becoming an "Impresendekor," a formally varied and semiotically dense but, of course, far from univocal emblematic composition, which seems connected specifically with Piero's taste. 134 Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1964], pp. 304f.). The passage is signaled by Gorni, "Certame Coronario" (see note 8), p. 13, who notes Vitruvius's explicit mention of iudices litterati and an audience comprising populus cunctus. Gorni also points out that the rare term coronarius occurs in Vitruvius (p. 1 4). 129. P.

Paoletti notes that there is no confirmation in the 141 7-141 8 inventory of the claims of Vasari that Lorenzo possessed images of "giostre, tornamenti, cacce, feste ed altri spettacoli fatti ne' tempi suoi." Of course, Lorenzo may have collected such objects only later than 141 7, perhaps especially in the years following his brother's rise to power. 132. For what follows, see J.

As noted by Tonnesmann (see note 26), p. 71. But since "Piero's political position is identical to Cosimo's," Tonnesmann sees no reason to inquire about the specific patronage of one or the other, at least with regard to the design of the palace. For the term "Impresendekor," see Bulst (see note 120), p. 92. Bulst uses the term only of the interior of the palace, in which he thinks Piero's courtly taste was allowed free rein, even during Cosimo's lifetime. It seems to me no less appropriately applied to the exterior.</page><page sequence="24">62 RES 34 AUTUMN 1998 Such a characterization fits the facade designs both of the Palazzo Medici and the Palazzo Rucellai (fig. 2), whatever the obvious contrasts between them. In both we admire the way certain elements are made to carry both ancient Roman and traditional Florentine princely and civic connotations. In both cases, also, the facade is frankly treated as surface-that is, as a semiotic entity rather than as the "natural" index of interior spatial relations.'35 Such an approach betrays a thoroughly Albertian cunning, even if it took the practicality of a Michelozzo or Rossellino to bring it to fulfillment. The complex referentiality across space and time of the palace facade may well also resonate with the particular interest of Piero de' Medici in historical writing. 136 Brunelleschi, as Hyman argues, envisaged a building oriented in directional or topographical and abstract or geometrical terms toward San Lorenzo. In spite of the Libro di Antonio Billi-or at least one version of it there now seems no question that a site other than the present one was seriously considered. However, an early project for the palace may have placed the main entrance on the Via de' Gori, rather than on the Via Larga; the southern frontage of the palace, facing the heart of the city, on the Via de' Gori remained the longest of the original building.'37 Caroline Elam has stressed the importance of the corner view in contemporary Florence (though hardly, it seems, in Brunelleschi's work!) and of the specific visual effect of the palace's architecturally enhanced "Corner of the Medici" (Canto de' Medici) on anyone proceeding north from the Baptistry into what had by now become an extended Medici enclave.'38 The corner was given emphasis by the loggia and coat of arms, as well as by the convergence of two matching, monumental facades. As Elam notes, a canto was far removed from prevailing conceptions of the expansive and regular piazzas of the Renaissance; it was nothing more than a meeting of streets at a prominent corner, such as occurred rather frequently in Florence. In the De re aedificatoria, Alberti would soon situate what he calls the trivium, formed by the meeting of streets, on a hierarchy of public spaces, from the street to the piazza'39 It is a description that applies very well to the new Canto de' Medici, but of course also to the Canto degli Alberti, with its medieval tower and archaic loggia dominating the southern stretch of the Via de' Benci, a street that marked, as did the Via de' Gori, the path of the early-twelfth-century wall system. These correspondences between the Alberti and Medici complexes, the dominant patrician complexes in their respective gonfaloni (urban districts), can hardly be coincidental. Both buildings, for all their formal differences, can be understood as addressing the city through an anthropomorphism ascribed to the urban environment by Dante, who figured the towers of Florence these probably already included the Alberti tower-as giants.140 Through novel architectural means and the institution of a novel visual rhetoric, the Medici Palace raises to a new level the idea of the building as a site and even subject of enunciation, though the presence of a traditional type of space-the loggia accommodating interaction is surely also significant.141 Dominating the field of attention established by the canto, the palace not only expresses certain familial and civic values and qualities, but it also presents an emblematic portrait of the Medici family at a time, as we saw, of particular concern with the portrayal of family members. This emblematic quality of the palace is cumulatively evoked, needless to say, on different levels of specificity, as occurs more distinctly in the Rucellai facade that Alberti would shortly design, evidently in part to 135. The "facadism" of the Palazzo Rucellai is obvious; for that of the Palazzo Medici, see Preyer (see note 1 04), p. 64: "la facciata si mostra quindi come un semplice rivestimento applicato all'edificio, a differenza di quasi tutti i palazzi piu antichi in cui la muratura prosegue oltre tutti gli spigoli." It is indeed curious that Preyer, the first to give due emphasis to this aspect of the facade, should want to attribute its design to Brunelleschi! 136. Ames-Lewis (see note 24), p. 70. 137. The main facade is 40.80 m (10 modules), and that on the Via de' Gori 38.30 m (9 modules), excluding the garden wall; see Bartoli (see note 118), p. 76. 138. C. Elam, "II palazzo nel contesto della citta: strategie urbanistiche dei Medici nel Gonfalone del Leon d'Oro, 141 5-1430," in 11 Palazzo Medici Riccardi di Firenze, ed. G. Cherubini and G. Fanelli (Florence: Giunti, 1990), pp. 44, 47. She notes that the Via Larga did not reach much farther north than the rear of the church of S. Marco; in other words, the street gave access to, but not through, a quite circumscribed area. 139.

Dante Alighieri, Inferno, Canto 31, 27-33. 141. Preyer (see note 104), p. 61, notes that the type of the Medici loggia was quite unusual but likens it to a loggia that existed in the present Palazzo Horne, the former Palagetto Alberti(!).</page><page sequence="25">Burroughs: (rammar and expression in early Renaissance architecture 63 celebrate a rapprochement of the Rucellai and Medici families.142 The Medici heraldic insignia, the famous palle, appear as a discrete coat of arms, conspicuously mounted on the corner of the palace but also along with other family devices-integrated into window surrounds, on the model of the Palazzo della Signoria, and into the decoration of the cortile.143 The emphatic replication even of heraldic elements like the palle enforces their redundancy in terms of heraldic coding but associates them with wider, indeed more emblem like, allusiveness and with the cultural sophistication required in the response to this.144 Moreover, the prevalence and architectural integration of such decorative details invites the observer to understand crucial elements of the architectural composition as emblematic in character. This is surely the case of the rustication, whose multiple connotations and sophisticated facture have been extensively discussed by modern commentators. Even the organizing grid of the building itself belongs in this context. Accordingly, the Brunelleschian courtyard-a model of rigorous and transcendentally grounded architectural grammar becomes an emblematic construct, as evocative and expressive as any of the imagery and statuary set within it.145 It marks a transition between or rather an epoch-making convergence of the developing architectural expertise of Alberti and his long-standing interest in emblematic representations and allusions. If in his architectural treatise, no doubt for strategic reasons, Alberti focuses on the former to the exclusion of the latter, the convergence nevertheless occurs again, to remarkable effect, in the actual buildings that he would design over the rest of his life. 142. Burroughs (see note 125), p. 41. 143.

Tonnesmann (see note 26), p. 84, draws attention to the repetition of heraldic material but draws different conclusions from mine. 145. A compelling parallel is Alberti's design for the Cappella Rucellai in San Pancrazio. Nowhere did he depart farther from Brunelleschian models than in the strangely exotic miniature simulacrum of the Holy Sepulcher, with its sophisticated fusion of courtly Gothic, Roman and Tuscan all'antica, and even Arab elements. But Alberti set these as if by willful contrast within a markedly Brunelleschian barrel-vaulted chapel of gray pietra serena membering against white walls, perhaps to emphasize the specific, local site of this architectural evocation of the great mystery of Christianity. Far from mirroring reality, here Brunelleschi's architectural system appears as just another "style," as a quotation with specific and limited cultural connotations. Borsi (see note 1 01), pp. 1 1 1 f., notes the contrast between the two elements and emphasizes the various evocations of Florence in the chapel, not only in the architectural decoration but also, by contrast, in emblematic forms, for example, in the frieze of lilies crowning the aedicula, though in style the latter suggests northern or "oriental" ornamental fashion.</page></plain_text>
