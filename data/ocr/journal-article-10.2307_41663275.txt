<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS Anniversary Meeting of AIA The fifty-sixth General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, December 28-30, 1954, brought the society together to cele- brate its seventy-fifth anniversary at Boston, its birthplace. The meetings at the Sheraton-Plaza Hotel, held in conjunction with the American Philo- logical Association, were well attended. The Local Executive Committee de- serves much credit for the success of the conference. The sessions began with the Annual Meeting of the Council, at which the Institute's business was transacted. The slate of officers proposed by the nomi- nating committee was voted into office for the coming year: Henry T. Rowell, President; Carl W. Biegen, Vice-Presi- dent; Cedric Boulter, General Secre- tary; and Christine Alexander, Re- corder. An important item was the an- nouncement of the transfer of the General Secretary's office from Cam- bridge to Cincinnati. The papers presented at the first session, Tuesday afternoon, reported the results of excavations and studies in the Greek area. J. Lawrence Angel discussed stature change and sociologi- cal-biological development during pre- historic and historic times on the basis of newly excavated human bones from Lerna, Mycenae and the Agora at Athens. The discovery of a palace of the Early Helladic Period at Lerna was reported by John L. Caskey. Following J. Walter Graham's argument for the location of the Cretan bull ring in the palace courtyards, George E. Mylonas described the New Grave Circle at Mycenae which is reported in his arti- cle in this issue. Alan J. B. Wace also reported on his season's work at My- cenae, mainly in the so-called House of Shields and House of Sphinxes. The session ended with two more papers on Mycenaean subjects. Jane E. Henle con- sidered criteria for judging a decipher- ment of the Minoan script while Sara A. Immerwahr re-examined some My- cenaean vase-painters. Wednesday morning's symposium on Roman colonization was opened by E. T. Salmon, who pointed out that the colonies of the "Latin name," de- spite the fact that they were soon re- placed by other types, were of supreme importance in the formation of the concept of Roman citizenship and hence in the development of Rome's empire. Paul MacKendrick, using nu- merous aerial photographs, illustrated the similarity in the ground plan of the Roman colonies , and argued that the plan was very likely derived from Etruria. Lawrence Richardson, chiefly on the basis of terra-cotta temple orna- mentation, demonstrated that before 200 B.c. the colonies used a "colonial style" derived from the architecture of their neighbors and not from Rome but that after that time Rome devel- oped its own distinctive style and this is reflected in the colonies. Doris Tay- lor provided an analysis of Cosa's for- eign trade relations based on her study of the black-glazed "Campanian" pot- tery found on the site as well as in Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Gaul and Spain. The symposium on "Homeric Back- grounds," held jointly by the AIA and the APA in the New Lecture Hall of Harvard University, began with Carl Blegen's description of the latest ex- cavations at Pylos, in particular the area of the principal gateway to the palace court. Carl Roebuck, reviewing the history of Ionia, pointed out that the finds from Old Smyrna support the theory of a Greek migration to this area in the eleventh century B.c. Em- mett Bennett discussed a certain group of Linear B tablets from Pylos and showed how by pure deduction he was able to conclude that these dealt with landholdings. When Ventris later de- ciphered the tablets it became clear that the group of landholders involved was predominantly religious in composition. James Notopoulos closed the session with a discussion of Homeric formulae and originality. At the joint annual banquet Wednes- day evening the speakers honored the past, present and future of the Ar- chaeological Institute of America. After Sterling Dow surveyed the events connected with the founding of the In- stitute, the guests were privileged to hear from Harold North Fowler, who seventy-five years ago took part in or- ganizing the original society. His remi- niscences of the founding will long be remembered by those present. The story of the excavations sponsored by the Institute and the work of the various schools which have taken up the task was set in the perspective of the last seventy-five years by William B. Dins- moor. Richard B. Stillwell, the editor of the American Journal of Ar- chaeology, spoke on the publications of the Institute, and Henry T. Rowell, the President of the AIA, brought the speeches to a close in addressing him- self to the problems of the Institute's future. Three sessions for the reading of papers were held on the last day of the meeting, two in the morning and one in the afternoon. One morning session dealt exclusively with Greece, and ex- cept for Oscar Broneer's report on the temple of Poseidon at the Isthmia (see his article in this issue) exclusively with Attica. Other reports on recent excavation were by George E. Mylonas on new material from the cemetery at Eleusis and by Homer A. Thompson on the status of work at the Athenian Agora in 1954. Thalia Phillies Howe argued that the attributes of the triple- bodied monster of the Acropolis are suitable to Zeus Herkeios. Matthew I. Wiencke discussed the newly-cleaned east frieze of the Hephaisteion in terms of dating. D. A. Amyx pointed out the likely association with Alcibíades of Panathenaic amphorae included in a list of confiscated property. Roads and 63</page><page sequence="2">road construction in ancient Attica formed the subject of John H. Young's paper. The other morning session was con- cerned with the archaeology and art of Western Asia and relations with Greek art. The two strictly archaeolog- ical papers were Machteld J. Mellink's report on a preliminary survey of Bronze Age sites in Lycia and Imman- uel Ben-Dor's discussion of pottery from a- Phoenician cemetery on the northern coast of Palestine, which has closer links with pottery from Phoeni- cian sites in Carthage and Sicily than with other Palestinian pottery. The re- maining papers were concerned with artistic problems. They included Hel- ene J. Kantor's discussion of the Ori- ental forerunners of Greek plant de- signs, Edith Porada's paper on Greek influence on a fifth century B.c. seal- cutter from Ur, Dorothy B. Thomp- son's report on an unpublished portrait of Arsinoé II representing the Ptole- maic queen as deified, and Berta Se- gall's discussion of Hellenistic sculp- ture recently found in South Arabia which provides evidence for dating some South Arabian cultures. The last session provided papers on a variety of classical subjects. Recent additions to his collection of Greek vases were reported by David M. Rob- inson. The successful reassembling of a life-size bronze statue recovered in 1900 from an ancient shipwreck was described by Rhys Carpenter, and three bronze hydriae in the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Dietrich von Both- mer. Alfred R. Bellinger in his paper on the drachmae of Alexander the Great pointed to the economic rather than political distribution of mints in Alexander's empire. A vase adorned with three friezes of relief-figures, pre- sumably from a tomb at al-Mina and to be dated to the first century A.D., was described by Christoph W. Clairmont. Eric C. Baade suggested that the House of the Little Fountain in Pompeii had certain features designed to give the il- lusion of a large house. The final pa- per, by Robert Scranton, described the city plan of twelfth century Corinth as an important document of Byzantine architecture. The final event of the meeting was the showing of three films, all in color, on archaeological subjects. The first was on the striking Palaeolithic cave paintings at Lascaux in the Valley of the Dordogne, France. The other two were both by Ray Garner: Be-ta-ta- kin, "House Under the Rim," the story of an Arizona pueblo of seven hundred years ago, and Egypt,, the magnificently filmed record of ancient Egyptian civilization which was first presented to the AIA at the 1953 meeting. Splendid exhibits had been arranged for the meeting by museums and li- braries. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, presented "Famous Ancient Masterpieces from American Muse- ums," while the Fogg Art Museum had two fine exhibits, "Ancient Art in American Private Collections," which, like the Boston Museum show, included examples of Near Eastern, Egyptian, Greek and Roman art; and "Hellenistic Art in Asia," including Parthian and Gandharan material. The Houghton Li- brary of Harvard showed archaeologi- cal publications of the last five centuries while the Widener Library had on view publications of the AIA representative of its seventy-five years of existence. An exhibit of coins lent by members of the Boston Numismatic Society was displayed in the hotel lobby. Even an enterprising bank, the Institution for Savings in Roxbury, had in the window of its Back Bay branch an exhibit of ancient art from the Fogg Museum col- lections as a salute to the anniversary meeting. A felicitous opportunity to see the Fogg exhibits was provided by the buffet luncheon at the museum tendered by Harvard University, the good genius of that society of three- quarters of a century ago which be- came the Archaeological Institute of America. Egypt Center Address For the information of students and others who may wish to communicate with the American Research Center in Egypt, its present address is : Isis Build- ing, Sharia el Walda, Garden City, Cairo. The telephone is: Cairo 27076. The Director, Dr. Bernard V. Bothmer, reports much interesting work being undertaken by archaeologists in Egypt. Accounts of their projects and the re- sults will appear in future issues of Archaeology. University Museum Expeditions Egypt's Department of Antiquities and the University Museum of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania are currently joining forces to explore a long-buried part of the temple of Ptah at Memphis, capital of ancient Egypt. The main temple of Ptah - chief Egyptian divin- ity in early times - was excavated early in this century, but some of its satellite buildings remain to be unearthed. The new excavation site was discovered accidentally by road-builders. After World War II they came upon the rem- nants of certain chapels at what appar- ently is the southwest corner of the temple precinct. Dr. Mustafa Amer, di- rector of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities, will be in over- all charge of the project. Dr. Ahmad Badawi, an Egyptian university professor, will be a consulting authority. Representing the museum will be John M. Dimick, proj- ect director, Dr. Rudolf Anthes, cura- tor of the Egyptian section, and Dr. Henry G. Fischer, assistant curator. The University Museum's 1955 cam- paign at Gordion in Turkey should get under way about April first and con- tinue (with a break during the har- vest) until about October 20. Rodney Young will be in charge of the spring and summer work, Roger Edwards in the fall. Ellen Kohler will as usual run the indoor work - cataloguing, clean- ing, mending, etc.; and Christofis Poly- karpou of Curium in Cyprus will un- dertake the surveying and architectural work. Neophyte excavators will be David Crownover of the University of Pennsylvania and Robert Barnes of Colby College; Theresa Howard Carter of the University Museum will identify and study the animal bones, an innova- tion for Gordion. At the close of the spring term Mabel Lang and Machteld Mellink from Bryn Mawr and Mr. and Mrs. Curtis Dahl of Wheaton College will join the staff. Objectives of the 1955 campaign will be to lay bare more of the Persian Empire building which was decorated with wall paintings dat- ing from about 500 B.c.; to clear all the area to the west of the city gate from the Persian down to the Phrygian level; and in particular to open the great stone-built gateway of the Phrygian city, which is known to stand to a height of about twenty-five feet and which, when cleared, should be one of the most impressive ancient monuments of Asia Minor. Classical Meeting at Oxford An interesting meeting devoted to Classics and Classical archaeology is scheduled to take place in Oxford, Eng- land, from August 4th to 11th. Con- ducted by a joint committee of the Greek and Roman Societies, the pro- gram will present lectures by a number of authorities, including Sir John Beaz- ley, Mr. J. B. Ward-Perkins and Pro- fessor Luisa Banti. Visits are being ar- ranged to libraries, colleges and country houses. The detailed program and in- formation concerning cost and accom- modations may be obtained from the Secretary, Miss Louise B. Turner, Bays- ton, Cross Oak Road, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England. 64</page><page sequence="3">Left: The Tyche of Kapilavastu, Gandhara, second century A.D.

Hellenistic Art in Asia (This report is by Dr. Benjamin Row- land, Jr., who arranged the exhibit.) The exhibition of Hellenistic art in Asia, held at the Fogg Art Museum be- tween December 28, 1954 and February 15, 1955, was arranged to honor the Seventy-fifth Anniversary Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in Boston. As far as is known, this marked the first showing in this country of material representing the regions of the Orient influenced by the art of Greece and Rome. Although the title might lead some to suppose that the ex- hibition was devoted only to the famil- iar Graeco-Buddhist sculpture of Gan- dhara, actually the most interesting part of the show was the sections illustrat- ing the art of the Seleucid Empire in Mesopotamia, Iran and Bactria and the examples of Parthian art in stone, metalwork, and ceramics. Although the exhibition was not organized with any fixed didactic end in view, the collection of objects, dated from the fourth cen- tury b.c. to the fifth century A.D., served to illustrate the vitality and per- sistence of Hellenistic ideals over the vast stretch of territory extending from the Euphrates to the Indus. Installed as a frontispiece to the ex- hibition was the magnificent Lysippic head of Alexander from the Boston Museum, chosen as a symbol of the conqueror responsible for the wave of Hellenism that swept over Asia in the centuries after his march to the Indus. The art of the Seleucid rulers of Iran was represented by two limestone heads of silent that once decorated a sanctu- ary of Dionysus in the Nisaean plains of Media. The art of the Parthian Empire in- cluded a wide variety of examples in many different media: sculpture and wall-paintings from Dura, terra cottas and alabaster figurines from Seleucia, glazed pottery vessels and a number of small sculptures in stone and metal. Among these later objects special men- tion should be made of a bronze statu- ette of Astarte, lent by the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art, Kansas City. Sometimes identified as North Syrian, but probably a Parthian work from one of the former Greek cities in Mesopotamia, this object is related to representations of Venus Anadyomene as well as the Parthian conception of Anahita. The figure reveals a curious combination of voluptuousness with the frontality of the ancient Near East- ern portrayals of the Mother goddess. A no less mysterious piece is the crowned head of a woman, lent by the Cleveland Museum. This object, al- though' obviously Cypriot in origin, is reputed to have been found in the ruin fields of ancient Bactria. Certainly the possibility of such an import is not out of the question if we think of the great hoards of early Greek coins found in Afghanistan. The Bactrian section also included a silver bowl from Olbia, lent by the Metropolitan Museum, and a number of coins from the superb cabi- net of the Boston Museum. One of the most striking sections of the exhibition displayed objects of Graeco-Roman origin imported to India and Afghanistan in the first and second centuries A.D. In addition to ex- amples of Alexandrian metalwork from Taxila, lent by the Government of Pak- istan, this collection included a number of Graeco-Roman terra cottas, sensi- tively modelled figurines from the vi- cinity of Peshawar that are the Indian counterparts of the Graeco-Parthian statuettes from Seleucia. Also exhibited were a number of steatite paterae with lively erotic scenes again reflecting an unmistakable Alexandrian taste and origin. The Gandhara sculpture in the exhi- bition, although including specimens of the usual Buddhist figures, was selected primarily with the idea of illustrating the persistence of Hellenistic motifs and techniques as late as the second and third centuries A.D. The "Tyche of Kapilavastu," lent by Major-General H. L. Haughton, is an Eastern example of the Greek city goddess also repre- sented in a relief from Dura Europos. Two fragmentary reliefs, a Parthian 65</page><page sequence="4">clay frieze also from Dura and a door jamb from Gandhara, imitate to a re- markable degree the vine motif enfram- ing Dionysiac or erotic scenes so famil- iar in the ornamental reliefs of Baalbek. In addition to the stone carvings the collection of Gandhara material in- cluded a handsome display of stucco sculpture. There is a tendency to regard the work in this material as later than the sculpture in stone, but it has become more an¿ more evident to the present writer that the decoration in lime plas- ter also belongs to the period before A.D. 241 when Gandhara became a Sasa- nian province. The head of a man, lent by the Nelson Gallery of Art, so closely approximating the pictorial style and passionate intensity of the Scopaic for- mula, provides a final dramatic proof of the vitality of the Hellenistic tradi- tion in Asia even in its last phase. Cyprus Dig In the spring of 1955 a University of Missouri expedition to Cyprus is plan- ning to conduct trial excavations at an early prehistoric settlement site not far from the village of Episkopi, district of Limassol, near ancient Curium. The site was visited in 1951 by Professor Saul Weinberg of the University of Missouri while working at a Late Bronze Age settlement near Episkopi, and the present excavation will be un- der his supervision. If the site proves as productive as surface finds have indicated, excava- tions of larger scope are planned for the spring of 1957. Investigations in Argentina (December 1953-March 1954) (This report by Dr. A. R. Gonzalez was translated by Dr. R. P. Schaedel.) Under the auspices of the Argentine Society of Americanists, Buenos Aires, Dr. Alberto Rex Gonzalez conducted a series of archaeological investigations in the western valleys of the State of Catamarca. These are part of a project previously planned for the purpose of completing investigations in the valley of Hualfin, and of establishing bases for the correct chronology of the Dia- guita area, of which this valley is al- most the geographical center. Part of this program was accomplished in two former campaigns (1951-1952), the re- sults of which were recently reported at the preliminary meeting of the first Round Table on Northwest Argentine Archaeology, in Buenos Aires. The new investigation began at Londres, in the little valley of Chincal, west of Belén in Catamarca, wh'ere a small nucleus of ruins was excavated. These were composed of big rooms, approximately four by ten meters, all surrounded by a wall and connected in- ternally by a series of causeways, stair- ways, retaining walls, benches, etc. The rooms have walls of unworked stone with clay mortar, reaching in certain places to a present height of almost three meters. In a small bench attached to a wall was found a series of little seats, an unusual architectural detail in Northwest Argentina. A study of the ceramics obtained indicates that they were either entirely Incaic or of Incaic influence; strictly local ceramics are rare. Since this situation is repeated in a refuse heap in the vicinity and in an- other group of ruins nearby, there can be no doubt that the ruins represent one of the numerous Incaic garrisons within the Northwest Argentine area, the ex- istence of which is known from histori- cal sources. On certain hills in the vicinity of these ruins there are also remains of pottery showing Incaic influence. One exception to this is the hill called "Loma Larga," where for the first time ceramics of the "Draconian" or "Bar- real" type were found in a stone-walled habitation. This structure, some five meters long, has the form of a hill which was specially prepared for the purpose. The location and type of structure indicate a ceremonial use. The second part of the investigations centered in the site of La Puntilla, near Belén. There a number of urns for the interment of children were excavated, pertaining to two distinct ceramic types. One has painted geometric mo- tives of red-on-buff, the second type consists of black urns with incised geo- metric designs. In these urns the "Dra- conian" motive does not appear. In the cultural chronology of Northwest Ar- gentina these finds would be placed in the phase designated as "La Ciénaga." The third part of the investigations was conducted in the zone of Laguna Blanca in the Department of Belén. This zone, which probably constitutes the northwest limit of the region up un- til now known as Diaguita, was hitherto virtually unknown archaeo- logically. One of the reasons for this is the lack of good roads, so that one has to travel 150 kilometers over very bad terrain to reach the area. The ruins of Laguna Blanca cover many hectares. The most obvious ruins consist of great walled enclosures of irregular form and dimensions, ten to fifteen meters on a side, with some even larger, made of walls without mortar (pirca). These enclosures are similar to those which the present-day inhabitants use for planting potatoes or habas (a local pea- like vegetable), for which reason one may infer a similar use in prehistoric times. In one case these enclosures cover several hundred hectares; from this one may postulate a former very dense population. The excavation in Laguna Blanca re- vealed several distinct cultures. Frag- ments of pottery and burials were found corresponding to the cultures of Condor-huasi, La Ciénaga, Candelaria, and also to a periód more recent, with influences from Belén and Inca. It is uncertain to which of these periods the enclosures for planting correspond, but indications point to the most recent. In addition to the cultures with pot- tery and agriculture, one site was found which produced only stone implements, particularly various large blades and knives. It is presumed that this repre- sents one of the pre-ceramic cultures which occupied this zone. Another find of great interest in La- guna Blanca was a large group of pet- roglyphs in a place called La Torre; these belong to two distinct periods. The most ancient are figures of guana- cos or extremely simple anthropomor- phic figures, like those found in Pata- gonia in 1949. The more recent are anthropomorphic figures, complicated or elaborated, large faces with designs on the cheeks, or else figures of animals such as the tiger or puma rendered with great fidelity. In some instances the su- perposition of the more recent figures over the ancient ones is very clear. The Laguna Blanca zone is an ex- traordinary archaeological center and there are many problems to be solved. We found remains of a road which ap- parently leads to the summit of the snow-capped Laguna Blanca (5,000 meters). The inhabitants state that the road ends in a series of constructions situated on the height of the snowcap. Adverse atmospheric conditions and lack of equipment prevented our reach- ing this point to verify the information; in view of the finds on Cerro Llullai- yaco and those of El Plomo in Chile, these should be of exceptional interest. During January-March 1954, Dr. O. Menghin made a study of the zone between San Antonio in the southeast and Bariloche in the southwest of the Territory of Rio Negro. The explora- tion of the coast to the east of San An- tonio (near the lighthouse of San Ma- tias) produced evidence of the exist- ence of two distinct classes of shell mounds of Mytilus shell. They are con- temporaneous in time but spatially sep- arated. The western group contains 66</page><page sequence="5">the industry common to the mainland sites of the Rio Negro region; the east- ern group lacks arrow points and prob- ably represents the last manifestation of a more primitive culture. In the vi- cinity of Ingeniero Jacobacci, at about eight hundred meters above sea level, great deposits of a pre-ceramic culture were discovered. This culture is char- acterized by magnificent foliate points of considerable size, and by lack of grinding stones and manos. It may date to the early post-glacial period. In addi- tion, a cave discovered by the founder of the local museum, Sr. Rodolfo Casa- miquele, was excavated. The principal layer of this showed a lithic industry attributable to the Casapedrense 1, of the early post-glacial, found also in the caves of Los Toldos, Territory of Santa Cruz (see Menghin: Runa , tomo V, page 39). In the same region are found numerous cave paintings with compli- cated grecques like those already known from the vicinity of Nahuel Huapí. Contrary to his previous opin- ion (see Menghin: Kuna V, page 14), Dr. Menghin concluded on the basis of his recent studies that these paintings are pre-Araucanian. He would also conclude the same about the engraved plaques and decorated ceremonial axes which abound in the zone of the Rio Negro and Chubut. All these elements are completely lacking in Araucania proper, where the ceremonial axes have an absolutely different character. In the caves of the Estancia San Ramón, on the shores of Lake Nahuel-Huapi, exca- vations and studies of paintings were carried out. In this section no pre- Araucanian remains were found. Twelfth Plains Conference (The following report was contrib- uted by the chairman of the Conference, Dr. William Mulloy of the University of Wyoming.) The twelfth Plains Conference for Archaeology was held at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, No- vember 25-27, 1954. The session began with registration on the first morning, which provided an informal opportu- nity for members to renew acquaint- ance and exchange ideas while viewing the exhibits brought by various mem- bers and displayed in the Department of Anthropology. About sixty-five reg- istered members were present as well as a number of visitors. The afternoon was devoted to a se- ries of short field reports describing ac- tivities during the past year. These re- flected investigations from all the Plains States and indicated that field work is still vigorous despite some cur- tailment of the Inter-Agency Archaeo- logical Salvage Program in the Mis- souri Basin. The field reports proved too numerous for this session and some were held over until the third day. The second day was devoted to eth- nological and social anthropological subjects, a new development this year. This part of the program was planned and directed by Dr. John M. Roberts of the University of Nebraska. A wide va- riety of subjects was covered, ranging from ethnological information recov- ered from the work of early artists and photographers to social problems aris- ing from the displacement of modern populations in areas covered by reser- voirs. It was hoped that this program would include a symposium on prob- lems and prospects in Plains Ethnology, but special papers were too numerous. This new development proved to be un- usually successful and the papers were heard with much interest. The hope was expressed that this kind of material will be included in future Plains Con- ferences, for it not only provides a local focal point for ethnological communi- cation but encourages significant cross stimulation between this field and ar- chaeology. During the evening, through the co- operation of Mr. Marvin Kivett, the members of the conference were the guests of the Nebraska State Historical Society Museum; this provided an op- portunity to see the museum's unusu- ally fine collections. Mr. Kivett and Dr. E. Mott Davis of the Department of Anthropology of the University of Ne- braska gave a lecture dealing with problems and techniques of presenting anthropological subjects on television programs. A sample program was pre- sented, followed by a reception. The third morning of the conference was given up to a series of papers deal- ing with non- agricultural and pre-agri- cultural manifestations, principally in the western part of the Plains region. As on the previous day, it had been planned to include a symposium on problems of chronology in the western region, but once more the number of papers offered prevented this. The number and variety of papers indicated an increasing interest in this aspect of Plains prehistory. It has been a long neglected area, due partly to the diffi- culty of dealing with the materials and partly to the fact that more spectacular agricultural and ceramic materials have claimed the attention of research workers. The papers indicated that a chronological structure of some depth is developing for this area and that a considerable amount of evidence is ac- cumulating to explain what went on during the long and hitherto almost un- known time gap between Early Man materials and immediately prehistoric manifestations. It is hoped that interest will continue in this still largely unex- plored field. The third afternoon session was de- voted to the overflow of field reports and several other papers. A business meeting was also held. Dr. Donald J. Lehmer of the University of Washing- ton was elected chairman for the year to follow. A resolution was passed ex- tending sincere thanks to Dr. John Champe and his staff for making avail- able the facilities of their department and helping to arrange the program; to the chairmen of the various sessions; and to many others whose aid made the conference possible. Dr. Champe again hospitably offered the services of his department for next year's meeting. Current Research on Middle East The Middle East Institute, a private organization in Washington, D. C., is preparing for publication an annual Survey of Current Research on the Middle East. The purpose of this Sur- vey is to provide scholars and educa- tional institutions with information on what research has recently been com- pleted or is now being undertaken. Definition of research: (1) accumu- lation of original data; (2) classifica- tion of original data; (3) interpreta- tion of data previously accumulated; (4) reinterpretation of data previously studied; (5) translation, bibliography, vocabulary, etc., with annotation. Geographical limits: the Arab coun- tries, Israel, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, North Africa, the Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Disciplinary limits: emphasis on so- cial sciences, but including related as- pects of humanities and natural sciences. Chronological limits: none (ancient, mediaeval and modern). All those who are currently engaged in research on the Middle East or have completed such research since October 1, 1954 are urged to submit the follow- ing information: name, address, topic of investigation, sponsoring organiza- tion (if any), date of completion or estimated date if still in progress, and pertinent comments on the nature of the research, sources being used and method of approach.
