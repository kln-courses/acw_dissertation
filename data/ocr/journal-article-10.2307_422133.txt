<plain_text><page sequence="1">Democracy and the Lessons of Dictatorship Nancy Bermeo Decades ago, the socialist Gaetano Salvemini wrote the following reflections on his behavior as a deputy in the troubled democracy of prefascist Italy. I must acknowledge . .. that I would have been wiser had I been more moderate in my criticism of the Giolittian system. For while we Italian crusaders attacked him from the Left, accusing him of being-as he was-a corrupter of Italian democracy in the making, others assailed him from the Right because he was even too democratic for their taste. Our criticism thus did not help to direct the evolution of Italian public life toward less imperfect forms of democracy but rather toward the victory of ... reactionary groups .... As for the results of the Fascist dictatorship in contrast with those of Italian democracy in the making, they are here before our very eyes. Let us hope that the Italians will not be the only ones to learn from that frightful experience.1 What do we learn from the triumph of dictatorship? How does the experience of authoritarian rule shape our views of democracy? Gaetano Salvemini's reflections show us that the lessons of dictatorship can be profound. Dictatorship can force us to reevaluate the nature of particular regimes, our enemies, and our own goals and behavior. The experience of dictatorship can produce important cognitive change. This process of cognitive change is the essence of what I call political learning. Political learning merits our attention because it is key to the reconstruction of democracy. It is thus an important element in our attempts to understand the process of redemocratization, though understanding political learning is not synonymous with understanding redemocratization as a whole. Redemocratization involves three phases: the breakdown of a dictatorship, the creation or reconstruction of a democracy, and the consolidation of a new regime. Political learning is most important during the second phase of the redemocratization process--at the critical moment between the crisis of the old order and the consolidation of the new one-for it helps explain why a new regime becomes democratic in the first place. It helps explain why, in essence, a dictatorship in crisis is replaced by a democracy rather than another dictatorial regime. Whether political learning affects the other phases of the redemocratization process remains an open question. Thus, this essay makes no claims about the relationship between political learning and redemocratization as a whole. Instead, it explains what political learning is, why political learning is key to the reconstruction of democracy, and how the concept adds to our current understandings of empirical democratic theory. The last section of the essay presents a general discussion of how political learning takes place.2 273</page><page sequence="2">Comparative Politics April 1992 Political Learning Defined Political learning is the process through which people modify their political beliefs and tactics as a result of severe crises, frustrations, and dramatic changes in environment. All people, followers and leaders alike, are capable of learning from experience, and political actors rarely weather economic depressions, internal wars, or the violent collapse of a form of government unchanged. Nor do they, in more stable situations, meet with constant political frustration and always continue believing and behaving as they did before. As Robert Axelrod observes in advocating an "evolutionary approach to norms," "what works out well . . . is likely to be used again while what turns out poorly is likely to be discarded. "3 The same can be said about the ideas one uses to guide one's behavior. Crises often force people to reevaluate the ideas that they have used as guides to action in the past. The changed ideas may relate to tactics, parties, allies, enemies, or institutions. The new ideas may be true or false, justified or unjustified, polarizing or compromising. Their relevance to democratic theory and to the construction of democracy derives not from their veracity but from the fact that they are believed and used as guidelines for behavior. In the recent past, scholars argued that basic beliefs were the product of childhood socialization in families and schools. If basic beliefs changed at all, they changed slowly, over generations. As Sidney Verba wrote recently in reflecting on his own earlier work, "what had not been clear" in the past, was "the degree to which political attitudes were labile and could be affected by political events."'4 The concept of political learning is based on the premise that beliefs are not fixed immutably in childhood and that they can be "affected by political events" such as the replacement of one regime with another. The triumph of dictatorship and the experience of authoritarian rule can, under certain circumstances, change beliefs and leave normative legacies that favor the creation of democracy. It is important to emphasize that political learning can affect beliefs about tactics as well as beliefs about more abstract phenomena. Tactics, or the conscious behaviors one uses to obtain a desired goal, may also be altered as a result of political shocks, crises, and frustrations. Gaetano Salvemini expected that his opposition to Giolitti would lead to "a more perfect form of democracy." Yet in retrospect he came to believe that his tactics led to the triumph of fascism instead. His "basic beliefs" about what constituted a "more perfect form of democracy" may have remained more or less the same, but his thinking on tactics changed dramatically. The cognitive changes involved in political learning can thus involve means or ends or both. Political learning can affect basic, ideological beliefs about political structures, or it can affect simply the means one prefers for achieving constant ends. Political learning can take ideological or tactical forms. What are the ideas that must be affected by political learning if democracy is to be reconstructed? At the most basic level, critical elites must change their assessments of the relative effectiveness of democratic institutions for the fulfillment of group goals. In order for this to happen, at least one of four subsidiary changes must take place. Elites must change their evaluations of the alternatives to democratic rule; they must change their evaluations of democracy itself; they must change the ordering or nature of group goals; or they must change their perceptions of one another. 274</page><page sequence="3">Nancy Bermeo These changes are all examples of political learning. Each takes place under certain conditions of authoritarian rule, as I shall illustrate below. They may occur individually, but they can also occur simultaneously, and the likelihood of reconstructing democracy increases if they do. The likelihood of reconstructing democracy also increases to the extent that diverse sectors of the political elite undergo the same sorts of changes. Several points of clarification are required to ensure that the nature of the changes embodied in political learning is fully understood. First, it must be emphasized that dictatorships do not always create prodemocratic cognitive changes. If they did, democracy would not be so rare. Moreover, there is a good argument for expecting dictatorship and all its horrors to sharpen discord, not to dull it. As Laurence Whitehead argues in his work on the cycle of dictatorship in Bolivia, "a failed democratization [and thus a renewal of dictatorship] teaches lessons that may be harmful to future endeavors." "It teaches revolutionary minorities not to disarm and place their trust in civilian compacts." It teaches the needy not to defer demands because the game may be canceled at any minute. Finally, it teaches the threatened dictators that force and "redoubled ruthlessness" can defeat the proponents of a new order.5 Even when political learning takes a prodemocratic form, it does not necessarily involve the emergence of a deep normative commitment to democracy per se. This is a second important point of clarification. As stated earlier, political learning may lead only to an alteration in tactics. Moreover, if elites simply "change their evaluations of the alternatives to democratic rule," they may reconstruct democracy "by default." Elites may come to tolerate and advocate liberal democracy, not because they have come to see intrinsic merits in a democratic political system, but because they have come to believe that the dictatorial alternatives are even less desirable.6 Rejecting dictatorship is not the ideal motive for the resurrection of democracy, but it is indeed a very common one. As Dankwart Rustow argues, democracies can be built by people who are not truly democrats. "Circumstances may force, trick, lure or cajole non-democrats into democratic behavior." Circumstances can force political elites to change their beliefs about the merits of dictatorship and support democracy as "a lesser evil."'7 A third point of clarification relates to the cumulative nature of the political learning process. Political learning occurs at an individual level, and since the stimuli in each individual's learning environment differ, the timing and nature of the learning experience may vary between individuals and between political groups. The scope of the sector of the elite that undergoes political learning is an important factor in predicting whether and when the reconstruction of democracy will take place. The likelihood that a democracy will be reconstructed increases with the diversity of the elite that experiences cognitive change. That is, if leaders of capital and labor, on the left and the right, all undergo some sort of prodemocratic learning, the likelihood of democratic reconstruction is greater than if learning occurs in just one group. Learning need not occur across the political spectrum, but a "critical mass" of learners must develop before the risky game of building democracy can begin. Thus, the concept of political learning allows plenty of room for cynicism and skepticism. Political learning does not occur uniformly within a polity. It may not involve a deep commitment to democracy as an end in itself, and sometimes prodemocratic political 275</page><page sequence="4">Comparative Politics April 1992 learning may not occur at all. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of prodemocratic political learning is common enough and important enough to merit close attention. Elites and the Reconstruction of Democracy Though political learning occurs at all levels of society, the learning experience of political leaders is particularly important for the reconstruction of democracies. Mass actions such as strikes, riots, and armed insurrections can bring down a dictatorial regime, but they do not in themselves produce an alternative. Popular mobilization and mass struggles are key to provoking crises within dictatorships and are thus of great importance in the first phase of the redemocratization process. But during the second phase of the redemocratization process elite bargaining and accords become key. Liberal democracies are (among other things) institutional arrangements, and as such they must be designed and erected by a relatively small sector of society. An electoral law can be endorsed by millions of people, but it must be written by a select few. Likewise, a constitution can be celebrated in the streets, but it must be drafted elsewhere. For better or worse, the construction of democracy is an occasion where "the beliefs of some are more important than those of others."s Democracy is almost always the fruit of popular struggle, and this must never be forgotten, but the design of formal democratic institutions is, of necessity, the work of a political elite.9 It thus makes sense to study elites in an exploratory inquiry into the reconstruction of democracies. But why focus on changes in elite beliefs? The answer is clear if we analyze precisely what the recreation of democracy involves. We often read of the "reemergence" of democracy. But the image is deceptive. Democracies do not "emerge" or reemerge as if propelled by some natural process. Nor are they anthropomorphic--they do not rise up under their own volition. They are recreated piece by piece, institution by institution, and the creators are usually old enemies. Democracies are recreated only where they have broken down, and the breakdown usually involves extreme hostility among national political leaders. Aside from the few cases in which democracies are crushed by foreign invaders and the even fewer cases in which democracies are destroyed by military men with no support from any political party leaders, democracies usually break down with the active or passive support of a substantial sector of the civilian political elite. This is an unpalatable fact but a fact nevertheless. Thus, in cases where democracies are being reconstructed, we have, at one time, a set of political leaders who refuse to accept the outcome of the democratic game and are willing to either condone or actually participate in the political elimination of opponents, then, at another time, a partially overlapping (sometimes identical) set of leaders who are willing to compromise and bargain. Across time, the opposing groups have often remained the same in name and basic social composition, but the priorities of their leaders have changed radically. Elites representing groups who were willing to harass and perhaps even kill each other at one time sit down and construct democratic accords at another. The fact that they are willing to construct democratic accords means that they are willing to reconstruct a type of regime that failed in the past. Ideas about this type of regime and about the various opposing groups that will operate inside it must change in order for the reconstruction to begin. Leaders must hold ideas at time B that they did not hold at time A. 276</page><page sequence="5">Nancy Bermeo The nature of elite thinking is especially important when the time comes to make a commitment to a democratic constitution. Whether this means drafting a new document or adopting an amended version of an older document, the occasion inevitably requires compromise. In order for compromise to take place, the various factions within the elite must not only assess their values but also rank them. They must decide what is paramount, what is negotiable, and what might be left to the essentially uncertain arena of the legislative process. Unless the range of negotiable issues expands, the divisions that produced the breakdown of democracy in the first place will simply emerge again. This is why the change of mind intrinsic to political learning is so important. The importance of changed ideas is well exemplified by the 1976 transition to democracy in Spain. There, leaders of the right and the left made dramatic concessions, with the right legalizing the Communist Party and the left accepting the monarchy. These were nonnegotiable issues when the dictatorship began. They were quite literally issues of life and death during the Civil War, but by the time the dictatorship broke down, they were negotiable. The reconstruction of democracy in Spain would have been impossible without a change in elite ideas.'0 In fact, the reconstruction of democracy almost always requires some form of prodemocratic political learning." The importance of political learning becomes very clear if we reflect upon the history of the nations that have managed to reconstruct democracy. The discourse of elites in these concrete cases shows both the frequency and the nature of the political learning phenomenon. R6mulo Betancourt presents an excellent illustration of political learning in Latin America. As a leader of Venezuela's center-left Acci6n Democritica (AD), Betancourt was a major actor in the turbulence that led to the installation of the Perez Jimenez military regime. In 1958, after ten years of dictatorship, he helped to engineer the reconstruction of political democracy in Venezuela. Explaining the change, not simply in his own attitude, but in the attitude of his political rivals as well, he stated: The pessimistic forecasts were wrong. Interparty discord has been reduced to a minimum, revealing that [we], the party leaders, have learned the hard lessons that despotism taught all Venezuelans. Underground, in jail, in exile or at home with only the most precarious freedom, we came to understand that it was [our own] breech of civility and culture that opened the door to [the dictatorship].12 Betancourt conveys a sense of "lessons learned" that is reminiscent of Salvemini. Both Betancourt and Salvemini accepted responsibility for provoking the action of antidemocratic forces, and both illustrate a change in attitude not only toward democracy, but toward political opposition. The idea that a reinforced desire for cooperation can emerge from the experience of dictatorship is mirrored again and again in the writings and speeches of those who have experienced dictatorship first hand. Though writing as the head of a Communist Party at a different time in a different nation, Palmiro Togliatti's words were similar to Betancourt's. [For the people who have] survived the harsh and heroic tests of clandestine work, of the Special Tribunal, of the prisons, of the islands of confinement, of exile, of the Spanish War ... the need to be liberated from verbal extremism and the impotence of maximalism [is primary].13 277</page><page sequence="6">Comparative Politics April 1992 This recognition helped to lead Togliatti (like Salvemini and Betancourt) to propose major changes in party tactics. In describing what he called il partito nuovo--the new party--he promised: The new party is not only a party of the working class but of the people. It no longer limits itself to a role of criticism and propaganda but enters positively and constructively into the life of the country. The working class that in the past limited itself to a role of opposition and criticism intends today to assume a position of leadership along with other consistently democratic forces. '4 Evidence from Chile suggests that more recent dictatorships can leave legacies that are similar to those of earlier regimes. As Jorge Arrate, a leader of the Chilean Socialist Party (PSCH), wrote in 1982: The authoritarianism [of the Pinochet regime] has meant the consolidation of antiauthoritarian- ism in the heart of the left. . . . The loss of democracy and its denigration in the official discourse [of the dictatorship] induce a more profound appreciation of the value, meaning and contents of political democracy. ... . The words of Gabriel Valdes, a leading Chilean Christian Democrat, illustrate that the process of retrospective reevaluation was not confined to the Chilean Left. Suffering under the same yoke of oppression, old enemies began to view both their past and one another in different ways. We are the first to engage in self-criticism. It's certainly true that we engaged in sectarianism, that we made mistakes. [Now] we want to come to an understanding with others. We want to construct [a new type of democracy]. Why shouldn't the Socialists be able to change? They have changed in Europe. Today, the Socialists in Spain don't kill priests. They changed in Portugal. S. . Why shouldn't we accept that the Socialists in Chile [also] change? They have changed. ... If even we, the Christian Democrats, have changed, why shouldn't we recognize that others have changed?'6 The preceding quotations illustrate what evidence of political learning looks like and how often political actors themselves make explicit reference to the connection between the experience of dictatorship and cognitive change. It is important to add that evidence of political learning can not be gleaned from words alone. The political actors discussed above provide good examples of political learning not simply because they made these statements, but because they acted in accordance with them. Betancourt "explicitly renounced the full effect of AD's mobilizational capacity" in order to secure opposition support for Venezuela's pacted democracy.17 Togliatti agreed to participate in the Badoglio government, to include Mussolini's Concordat in the new constitution, and to support a law granting pardon to certain Fascist leaders, illustrating a remarkable willingness to make concessions on even the most divisive issues.18 Likewise, Arrate and Valdes were pivotal figures in engineering the concerted action that eventually led to the legal ouster of Pinochet. Without a united opposition, and without figures like 278</page><page sequence="7">Nancy Bermeo Arrate and Valdes who were willing to argue for unity, the Chilean dictators would never have been "beaten on their own playing field."'9 I am reluctant to dismiss the changes outlined above as idiosyncratic individual transformations. These actors were different enough in personality and background to make a purely psychological explanation unlikely. More important, these are just a few of the examples I might have used. We can find evidence of political learning in a wide variety of cases.20 Political Learning and Empirical Democratic Theory What does the concept of political learning add to empirical democratic theory? Scholars have connected democracy with specific values and beliefs since at least the time of The Republic. Whether the argument came from Tocqueville writing of "the habits of the heart," from Ostrogorski writing of "democratic manners," from Plamenatz writing of democratic "preferences," or from Almond and Verba writing of the "civic culture," an interest in the cultural foundations of democracy appears again and again. The recognition that attitudes and beliefs are an important factor in the making of democracy even appears in the work of scholars who are classified as "structuralists." Barrington Moore, for example, argues that the establishment of democracy in Britain was advanced by "many subtle changes in attitude." The landed upper classes had to take on a "bourgeois hue." What is essential in the making of democracy, he writes, is that "bourgeois attitudes" "become stronger."21 The body of work that acknowledges the connection between democracy and particular beliefs is thus quite sizable. Yet, despite its extensiveness, the literature on the normative foundations of democracy provides only the beginning of an answer to the question of how democracies are reconstructed. There are several reasons for this. The first is that most of this literature focuses, consciously or unconsciously, on the ideas that sustain and enrich democracy.22 This is a perfectly worthwhile topic of research, but it is not what concerns me here. Questions about how democracy comes into being precede questions about democracy's maintenance and operation. The factors that explain the origins of democracy must be separated analytically from the factors that explain democratic stability. The second problem with existing work is what it says and fails to say about how ideas emerge and change. There are two currents in the literature that would have us believe that political learning is extremely unlikely under any conditions. At one extreme, we have scholars who argue that people simply do not make fundamental changes in their beliefs. Pareto believed that, though the species "could slowly, very slowly be modified, the individual changes very little indeed.'"23 People who subscribe to this position might argue that the reconstruction of democracy derives from a change in the cast of political actors rather than a change in the beliefs of individuals. Democracies are reconstructed, not because of political learning, but because old leaders die and new generations of leaders take their place. There can be little doubt that the death of intransigent leaders provides opportunities for elites with different beliefs, priorities, and styles to emerge. But there are at least two reasons why we can not attribute the reconstruction of democracy solely to the passage of 279</page><page sequence="8">Comparative Politics April 1992 time and the passing away of particular leaders. The first reason is that democracies are often recreated by the same leaders who witnessed or actually participated in the destruction of a previous democratic regime. (Colombia, Venezuela, and Uruguay provide good examples to prove the point.) But even in cases where the time between the collapse of one democracy and the creation of another is relatively lengthy, there is often some overlap of old and new elites. Spain's transition to democracy was engineered by King Juan Carlos and Adolfo Suarez, both members of a new generation of leaders, but their task was made easier by pivotal figures such as Santiago Carrillo and Jos6 Areilza, who were from a previous generation and had been politically active in the second republic.24 Even if there are cases in which no major party leaders survive the period of authoritarian rule, there is a second problem with attributing the successful reconstruction of democracy to a simple change of leadership, for we still do not know how the more compromising sets of leaders emerge. If a new generation of leaders really is more conciliatory than the last, we must still explain why this is the case. Why were they chosen? Theories that assume immutability beg the question. A second theme in the literature that proves problematic in the context of the reconstruction of democracy is the argument that "like produces like." There is a strong strain in empirical democratic theory that would have us believe "that authoritarian regimes are likely to . . . perpetuate authoritarian political cultures."25 The relationship between political structures and political attitudes and beliefs is often held to be not only reciprocal but positive. Scholars argue not only that ideas and institutions often affect one another, but that when effects are felt, they produce matching. Democratic institutions produce democratic attitudes, and authoritarian institutions produce authoritarian attitudes. Harry Eckstein works with this assumption when he asserts that stable government is possible only if authority patterns in the state are "congruent" with authority patterns in families and schools. The drive for matching patterns of authority is so natural and strong that leaders will either deliberately or "in some intuitive way" try to reshape incongruous authority patterns in society. Likewise, citizens will try to cope with the "strains" arising from incongruency "by changing the governmental patterns under which they live.'"26 Implicit in Eckstein's theory of congruence is the idea that authoritarian institutions produce real or would-be authoritarians and democratic institutions produce real or would-be democrats. Many scholars present an explicit version of a similar theme. T. B. Bottomore argues that professional groups, voluntary associations, and vigorous local governments are important foundations of democracy because "they provide so many occasions and opportunities for ordinary men and women to practice the business of self-government.'"27 Dankwart Rustow argues that "the very operation" of democratic procedures "will enlarge the area of consensus step by step. ... ."28 And Myron Weiner, citing J. S. Mill, argues that "authoritarian structures and democratic structures each breed particular kinds of personalities.'"29 The acceptance of this matching theme is not universal, but it is common enough for scholars to be surprised when citizens in authoritarian states appear no more authoritarian than citizens in democracies.30 The idea that like produces like has important implications when it filters into analyses of political history, for it leads to an emphasis on continuities across time. Sidney Verba writes that "the political memories" and "historical experience" of a nation have an important 280</page><page sequence="9">Nancy Bermeo "impact on political beliefs," but he assumes that this impact is one which perpetuates the beliefs and behaviors of the past. Like many others, he argues that, when "political history is a history of group conflict," "horizontal ties among the citizens of the political system" are bound to be weak.31 This type of reasoning is found in a broad range of scholarly work. Verba is not alone in assuming that history leaves legacies that perpetuate past beliefs and behaviors. Marx offers a classic version of this argument, asserting that men are frustrated in "revolutionizing themselves" because "the tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living."'32 Similarly, Moore emphasizes that culture, "made up from all sorts of wants, expectations and other ideas derived from the past," "screens out certain parts of the objective situation and emphasizes other parts. [Thus], what looks like an opportunity or temptation to one group will not necessarily seem so to another group with a different historical experience. . .."3 The difference between my argument and these is in my emphasis on discontinuity. Marx used the nightmare image to convey a sense of haunting and repetition. For Marx, in this context, the past was a recurring nightmare. Old regimes can certainly have these qualities. But old regimes can be nightmares of a different order. Old regimes can be the sort of nightmare that is simply so horrifying that it never leaves our consciousness. These old regimes are not a source of continuity but of discontinuity. They give rise to the feelings and activities embodied in the slogan "Nunca Mas!"--"Never Again!" They are the lessons learned and the past mistakes to be avoided. Hans Daalder and Arend Lijphart captured the potential for discontinuity in their analyses of consociational democracy. Daalder comes close to my own position when he reminds us that "the traumatic memory of past conflicts . . . may either perpetuate conflict or cause parties to draw together."34 Lijphart's thesis that consociationalism is possible only when "elites understand the perils of political fragmentation" is also relevant, for I am arguing that dictatorship sometimes teaches leaders what the "perils of fragmentation" are.35 Ideas raised in passing by Guillermo O'Donnell constitute another source of inspiration for my argument. In 1979, in the last few pages of a new edition of his classic work on bureaucratic authoritarianism, O'Donnell wrote that "politics is crucially affected by the capacity to learn" and hoped that the "still fresh history" of authoritarianism would provide "the opportunity for learning by the opposition."36 He did not discuss what this learning would entail or how it might take place, but his more recent work on redemocratization gives us some leads. In Transitions from Authoritarian Rule, he writes that "the ideological 'prestige' of political democracy" is higher now than ever before and attributes this to two factors, "the discrediting of the discourses and groups that propose an immediate and violent leap forward to . . . some form of socialism" and the "discrediting of the recent authoritarian experience."37 The process of "discrediting" old beliefs is what political learning is all about. Yet we will surely overlook this process and misunderstand the reconstruction of democracy if we fail to recognize that dictatorships can leave legacies that mark a discontinuity with the past. The concept of political learning proceeds from the assumption that authoritarian states do not necessarily perpetuate or expand authoritarian ideas and behaviors. This is not to deny that dictatorships will try to socialize and resocialize their citizenry. The histories of authoritarian regimes throughout the world are replete with attempts to do precisely this, 281</page><page sequence="10">Comparative Politics April 1992 through controls on media, educational curricula, and teaching faculties. But these attempts do not always work. Indeed, the recent rejection of Communism in eastern Europe suggests that even the most elaborate attempts at resocialization can fail. States may shape and create institutions with the hope of creating particular sorts of citizens, but the outcome is rarely if ever certain. Ostrogorski was correct in arguing years ago that "there is always a gap" between a people's institutions and their "manners and customs."38 Incongruity is commonplace. What are the forces that create gaps and incongruities? How do new beliefs emerge? Aside from the sort of work just cited in the discussion of congruity, democratic theorists have given little systematic attention to how the beliefs which interest us here first develop. The change in belief that is logically intrinsic to the reconstruction process has gone largely unexplained. This is a third problem with the existing literature and another area in which the study of political learning takes us in new directions. The tendency to "neglect sources of change in beliefs" has been noted by Robert Dahl. He reminds us that "alien, esoteric and unorthodox beliefs in one period may become part of the political culture at a later time" and thus that "the processes that make for changes in beliefs are as important as those . . . that make for stability." But he also cautions that studies of political culture "tend to concentrate exclusively on stable and persistent outlooks produced by socialization into an ongoing system of beliefs." We tend to "neglect sources of change in beliefs."39 This is not helpful for those of us who want to understand changes in elite thinking and changes in regimes. Dahl does something to remedy the shortcomings of the literature by attempting to explain how political actors acquire their beliefs. He argues that acquisition depends on the actor's exposure to the belief, the influence that the bearers of the belief exert on the actor's socialization, the personal prestige of the belief's advocates and antagonists, the success and failure of the people and groups who symbolize the belief, and finally the extent to which the belief is consistent with the actor's present beliefs and experiences." These formulations are so general that they only prompt a new set of questions. What determines the prestige and success of the bearers of the new belief? What determines their effect on an actor's socialization? What are the experiences and present beliefs that must be consistent with the new belief? Dahl is concerned with another, broader subject and knowingly leaves these questions unanswered. Nevertheless, he comes closer than many other theorists, for he recognizes the importance of understanding how democratic beliefs emerge. Recent work has not gone beyond the insights that Dahl offered us in 1971. For example, when a major 1987 cross-national study of third world democracy posed the question, "what then are the sources of . . . moderate and conciliatory leadership?," the answer was simply "the larger political culture."41 No one would argue that elite beliefs about moderation and conciliation would not derive from the "larger political culture," but the point is not very helpful. It illustrates only that we still know very little about how the beliefs associated with democracy emerge. We still seem to know very little about the etiology of democratic norms, beliefs, and behaviors, especially within the context of an authoritarian state. Yet the history of redemocratized states throughout the world shows us that beliefs about democracy do change, even within the context of dictatorships. What causes these changes? What, in other words, are the sources of political learning? This question requires much 282</page><page sequence="11">Nancy Bermeo more attention than it can be given here but by way of a conclusion I offer some tentative thoughts that might serve as a framework for future research. Some Possible Sources of Political Learning In considering the origins of prodemocratic political learning, we should first note that certain aspects of the process are not predictable. We can not know in advance what a given leader's experience in exile will be. Nor can we predict the effects of personality. Some individuals will remain intransigent no matter what their environment, and others will change but never admit to having erred in the past.42 The other point we should note is that no political culture is homogeneous. States with some democratic experience in the past are very likely to have some citizens who have prodemocratic beliefs even when a dictatorship seems quite secure. Thus, when we seek to understand the process of political learning, we are not asking how whole societies adopt wholly new beliefs and tactics. We are asking instead about how a "critical mass" of political actors comes to adopt the beliefs and attitudes that only a smaller and less powerful sector of society already holds. In general terms, the cognitive changes that affect this "critical mass" emerge from processes of comparison and interaction. The comparisons that give rise to political learning can be historical and domestic or international and contemporary. Salvemini made a historical comparison when he contrasted "the results of fascist dictatorship" with "Italian democracy in the making" and found the latter far superior. Political actors judge "what works" with reference to what they have seen in their own nations in the recent past. The appeal of democracy increases as the historical comparison between concrete national experiences of democracy and dictatorship favor the former. International comparison can be as illuminating as historical comparison. Political elites have much to learn from the successes and failures of their counterparts abroad, and though some actors seem to focus exclusively on domestic politics, many pivotal actors do not. Events in what one might call reference states are an especially important source of political learning. A reference state is a nation which serves as a point of comparison for political actors in another state. Reference states serve as reference points because of geographic proximity, cultural similarity, shared history, or some combination of the three. Dictatorial and oppositional elites often look abroad for insights about "what works and what does not." It is highly significant, for example, that the first postwar collapse of dictatorship in western Europe took the form of social revolution. The sudden and uncontrolled disintegration of the Salazar-Caetano regime in Portugal-a disintegration in which the dictatorial elite lost not only power but property -provided an important lesson for empowered political elites in Spain, and to a lesser extent Brazil. As the alternative of social revolution emerged in a reference state, controlled reform and liberalization seemed more appealing.43 A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred in the Republic of Korea under the administration of Roh Tae Woo. Roh's "wholesale acceptance of the [democratic] opposition's demands" in June 1987 was due in part to events in the Philippines. Although Roh opted for cooperation for a variety of reasons, he knew that intransigence had not staved 283</page><page sequence="12">Comparative Politics April 1992 off the February 1986 revolution in the Philippines and acted in part to avoid the unpleasant fate of Ferdinand Marcos.44 Just as events in reference states may affect the thinking of dictatorial elites, so they may affect the thinking of opposition groups. Leftist opposition leaders in Latin America were greatly influenced by Marxist critiques of the Soviet model which took root in France in the mid 1970s.45 On the other end of the political spectrum, many moderate opposition groups saw the success of the reformist transition in Spain as an indication that even well-established dictatorships could be dismantled without bloodshed. As Gabriel Valdes put it in 1983: "Spain did it, why shouldn't we be able to do it too? In Spain the divisions were much deeper than ours. .. ."46 It would be naive to argue that comparison leads all the pivotal actors in any dictatorship to learn the same lessons. Indeed, given the long-standing pillarization of the left and right in certain states, we might even doubt that they always looked to the same reference states. But what we can not doubt is that people take cues from the experience of their counterparts abroad and that they use these cues as cognitive and behavioral guidelines. This is probably especially true in situations of instability when oppositional and dictatorial elites are looking for new tactics to alter the status quo. It is then that "demonstration effects" are likely to be most powerful. Political learning through interaction can be as important as learning through comparison. Ironically, one of the most potent sources of attitudinal change during dictatorship emanates from the very acts of coercion that the regime takes to ensure stability. When a dictatorship forces a wide spectrum of its oppositional elite into exile and prison, it provides opportunities for interaction and identification that may lead to a stronger, more unified, and possibly more democratic opposition in the future. Francisco Weffort described the ironies of state coercion in a powerful essay on the democratization of Brazil. "State terror," he wrote, "reduced all its opponents, generally on the left, but also many liberals, to their common denominator as unprotected and frightened human beings. Civil society was born out of this experience of fear," and democracy began to emerge as a "core value" in Brazilian political culture.47 Focusing on political leaders specifically, Thanos Veremis recalls how the forced interactions brought about by state terror had similar effects during the colonels' dictatorship in Greece. Politicians of the right, center and left, who had been bitter opponents before 1967, met again in prison cells, police headquarters and the islands to which they had been exiled. Their hatred of the junta became a point of consensus which led to a reappraisal of past errors, some modification of political passions, and an outright dismissal of the civil war legacy of polarization. Thus the ground was laid for a postregime process of civilian renewal.48 The "reappraisal of past errors" intrinsic to political learning can come from other sorts of interactions as well. The interactions which occur during foreign exile often bring pivotal actors into new networks of foreign politicians and intellectuals where the diffusion of new ideas is especially likely. It is widely recognized, for example, that the Chilean Socialist Party was greatly affected by the experiences of party exiles in Europe. As Jorge Arrate recalls: "It was [exile in] Rome that affected me most. Rome affected us as much as the Cuban revolution or the government of Allende . . . in the past. It was there [reading 284</page><page sequence="13">Nancy Bermeo Gramsci and cementing close ties to Eurocommunists] that I changed my political perspective."49 The fact that the directorate of the Socialist Party installed itself officially in East Berlin had the ironic effect of reinforcing the party's commitment to "bourgeois" democracy. Party leader Carlos Altamirano recalls how he was "shocked by the absence of liberty" in the East.50o Like Ricardo Nufiez, Erich Schnake, and others who shared his East Berlin experience, Altamirano became a principal force behind the renovation of the PSCH.51 Interactions which occur domestically can also help to change attitudes, sometimes in surprising ways. In Spain, Brazil, and even Argentina, for example, business elites who interacted with government-sanctioned labor leadership came to learn that bargaining with more representative leaders might have advantages, even for capital. This explains why Spanish capitalists were willing to bargain with illegal unionists long before the democratization of Spain.52 It also explains why "time and again, [Argentinian] employers lamented the lack of representative spokesmen for labour" during the last dictatorship, and why Brazilian entrepreneurs began to bypass the dictatorship's corporatist unions after the massive strikes of the late 1970s.53 Whether political learning takes place through interaction or comparison, its frequency and content derive in large part from the nature of civil society and the dictatorial state. Dictatorships might seek to be monolithic and all-powerful, but they are usually neither. On the contrary, even under the most ambitious dictatorships there are sometimes organizational sectors within the state and organizational spaces within society which serve as arenas for the learning and diffusion of prodemocratic attitudes and tactics. That arenas for political learning can emerge within sectors of the dictatorial state itself is nicely illustrated by the case of the Franco regime. In Spain, various branches of the state apparatus served as conduits for liberalizing and democratizing ideas. These emerged, for example, in the ministry of education under Joaquin Ruiz Gimenez, in the ministry of information and tourism under Manuel Fraga Iribarne, and even in certain circles of advisors to Franco's "heir," Juan Carlos.54 The radically different case of the People's Republic of China provides another example. Even there, in a dictatorship which remains much more intrusive than the right-wing regimes I focus on here, an important learning forum grew up around an elite journal called the World Economic Herald. Started by top party cadres and linked to both the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and the Chinese Association of World Economics, the journal "became an important source of foreign ideas." 55 Through lectures, conferences, articles by foreign scholars, and politicians, it "helped set the agenda for the anti-government demonstrations" of spring 1989. Significantly, the government's first response to the mass mobilization was not to crack down on student demonstrators but to suppress the World Economic Herald.56 The example of the World Economic Herald provides us with two important reminders about the nature of dictatorship. First, arenas for the diffusion of new ideas can emerge even in situations of relatively high coercion. Second, organizations which are sanctioned for one function sometimes take on roles that sanctioning elites never imagined. A brief discussion of some more concrete examples will show how the process works. Of the many sanctioned organizations which have provided unexpected settings for political learning, the Catholic church is probably the best known. Whether through its own 285</page><page sequence="14">Comparative Politics April 1992 research organizations, church-sponsored media, or Christian base communities which serve as "schools for educating the exploited in their inalienable rights,'"57 sectors of the church have been key conduits for the diffusion of democratic ideas. Church organizations have also fostered democratic learning by fostering unity among opposition groups and by providing common ground on which old adversaries might meet. Organizations like the Bishops' Businessmen's Conference in the Philippines provided an important setting in which business elites and advocates for the poor united in common opposition to dictatorship.58 Organizations like the National Council for the Restoration of Democracy in Korea functioned similarly, bringing together a broad spectrum of groups opposed to the Park regime in 1974.59 In Chile, the Academy of Christian Humanism brought together "several important research groups of different political tendencies" and provided an "umbrella" of protection for a broad spectrum of political actors."6 In Uruguay, the same function was served by CLAEH (the Latin American Center for Humanistic Studies).61 Of course, church-related organizations did not always provide arenas for prodemocratic political learning. But there can be little doubt that sectors of the church have allowed their "sanctioned" political space to be occupied by a broad range of actors and in so doing have enhanced the sort of dialogue and unity that the remaking of democracy requires. Although they have attracted less scholarly attention than the church in this regard, professional associations have also provided important arenas for political learning under dictatorship. The roles of different associations have varied from regime to regime, but there can be little doubt that certain professional groups have played important roles in both the discrediting of dictatorship and the diffusion of ideas supportive of democracy. Social science research groups evinced a surprising durability during the last wave of dictatorship in South America and served as important learning arenas in a variety of states. Funded and protected by foundations and political parties in the United States and Europe, these groups fostered political learning by promoting contacts with prodemocratic associates in reference states. Most important, these organizations enhanced political learning by promoting contacts between previously divided groups within domestic social science communities. CEBRAP (Centro Brasileiro de Analise e Planejamento) in Brazil, CIESU (Centro de Investigaciones e Estudios Sociales) in Uruguay, and FLACSO (Facultad Latino-Americano de Ciencias Sociales) in Chile are but three of the associations that played this role in Latin America. The relations that were forged in these research groups became especially important as dictatorships liberalized, since many of the figures who were pivotal in the transitions to democracy were professionally active social scientists. Lawyers' associations have also provided important arenas for learning in a variety of dictatorial regimes. Sanctioned out of necessity by regimes which sought a faqade of rational-legal legitimacy, lawyers' associations often played surprising roles in the face of state coercion. In 1970 in Spain, for example, the National Legal Congress "converted itself into something resembling a parliament" in which people "with diverse ideologies [were] united by the democratic project."62 In Brazil, the national bar association, or OAB, played a similar role. Beginning by defending political prisoners and then becoming a vociferous advocate of human rights in general, the OAB was able to mobilize its politically diverse membership to "fight relentlessly for the rule of law."63 Asserting publicly that "the lawyers of Brazil decry the illegitimate nature" .of the military regime and that "no power is 286</page><page sequence="15">Nancy Bermeo legitimate without the consent of the people," the OAB did a great deal to discredit the military dictatorship.64 Although a number of prominent OAB members sided with the military government in its early years, "one by one they abandoned the regime."'65The fact that bar associations in both states were thought to represent the more conservative (and propertied) sectors of society gave their political positions special resonance. A democratic victory in these elite circles had repercussions throughout society. Journalists' associations, political parties, business groups, and human rights organiza- tions are but a few of the other types of organizations that might merit attention as forums for political learning. The examples offered above are illustrative and not exhaustive. The key point to be made here is that civil society is never wholly obliterated by authoritarian rule. This matters greatly. Dictators might wish to suffocate civil society, but the coercive structures they create function less like an opaque tarpaulin than like a poorly woven net. New ideas still filter into dictatorships from abroad, and citizens still have some view of what goes on in the outside world. Often the world has some view of dictatorship, too, as beatings, brutality, and assassinations are caught on camera. Exiles move back into systems of oppression through a variety of openings, and when they do, they carry new experience and sometimes changed ideas. Finally, there are the small free spaces that the net of dictatorship leaves unfettered. It is in those circles of society where state constraint is loosest that dictatorships so often find their greatest challenge. Those who enjoy the limited freedom of association which authoritarian regimes allow often use their political space as a forum for the dissemination of new and critical ideas. More important, perhaps, they often share their space with those who are accorded less freedom by the state. The comparisons and the interactions that provide the bases for political learning take place in a variety of settings, but these small free spaces are among the most important. As stated in the introduction, the reconstruction of democracy requires changes in ideas about dictatorship, democracy, group goals, and old enemies. Where civil society remains politically alive, dictatorship can be criticized, goals and democracy can be reevaluated, and old enemies and rivals can meet and build that minimum of trust that the democratic gamble requires. Though authoritarian regimes do not smother civil society altogether, the nets of coercion which they craft vary greatly across nations. Different types of regimes start with different types of civil societies and then accord different degrees of freedom to different groups. How much freedom exists and how it is used varies from case to case, and thus the content and extent of political learning varies as well. The variation between cases is greatly affected by the nature of economic development and class relations in a particular state, but we can not study political learning through economic lenses alone. The existence or absence of particular religious, legal, or cultural traditions affects the possibilities for learning, too, because these traditions also affect the nature of civil society under dictatorship. As Barrington Moore reminds us, political ideas "do not descend from heaven."66 They emerge from earthly experience and observations in identifiable situations and institutions. Using biographical and historical sources to reconstruct what key elites observed and experienced can enable us to understand when political learning takes place and why it takes a particular form. Understanding how elite ideas change will not enable us to understand the 287</page><page sequence="16">Comparative Politics April 1992 whole process of redemocratization, but it will help us to understand when political leaders can act in concert to craft democracy from dictatorial crisis.
