<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUST SO Wilfrid Mellers loses himself in Koechlivn's orchestral juirngle harles Koechlin (1867-1950) was a long-lived and propor- tionally prolific composer who in his numerous piano and chamber works created what he called 'imaginary landscapes' that are basically Old French, while embracing classical antiquity in both its civilising rationality and its primeval irrationality. If the 'decor' of works like the piano Paysages et marines and the sundry sonatas for a melody instrument with piano tends to be what Renaissance people called Arcadian, we must remember that the real Arcadia in ancient Greece was not picturesquely elegant but rudely barbaric, its reputation as a paradise on earth stemming from its being remote, and therefore unknown. This bears on the link between Koechlin's Arcadian landscapes and the elements in his music that, hinting at nightmares as well as daydreams, are on the verge of savagery and peril. It may not be fortuitous, therefore, that Koechlin's biggest work - and his best known, at least by repute - has a source doubly remote from his beloved France. For Kipling's Jungle books were written at the turn of the century by an Englishman who is the only major writer to hymn the pride and prejudice of industrialised, imperialised, Edwardian Britain. The esprit de coeur necessary to the colonial enterprise led Kipling to a re-vision of the course of English history in his children's stories, such as Puck of Pook's Hill (1906); and his supreme achievement, Kim (1901), was simultaneously about the Imperial Dream and the adolescent innocence necessary to sustain it. In the next year Kipling wrote his marvellous Just so stories for younger children, using narrative techniques, incantatory rhythms and mimetic refrains such as are common to fairy tales and orally transmitted sagas. The somewhat earlier Jungle books (1894-95, and therefore a hundred years old) carry the tale even further down the genealogical ladder, since, from the very heart of industrial technoc- racy, they envisage life through the senses of an adolescent boy who, mislaid in the jungle, had been reared by a miscellany of beasts. The Jungle books seduced Koechlin, as they had his polar opposite among composers, the Australian Percy Grainger, whose father had presented him with the books in 1897. Koechlin embarked on his Jungle book settings about the same time, though the two composers cannot have known one another's work. Koechlin's choral and orchestral jungle pieces, written between 1899 and 1901, are parasitic on Debussy's early nature- musics; he was in his forties when he started, in 1911, the first of the four purely symphonic poems inspired by Kipling's master- piece; and that piece was not completed until 1927, and remained unperformed until 1932. The other works were added in 1934, 1936 and 1939. Koechlin established an order for the sequence, though not until fairly modem times has the cycle been performed as a totality. This sequence evolves from Blakeian Innocence through Experience, perennially recurring in the fairy tale's 'for ever and ever'. Significantly, the movement that stands first is called La loi de la jungle (1934), and defines the Laws of Nature in the rudimentary terms of monody - the basis of Koechlin's approach to composition since, like his hero Berlioz, he tended to think horizontally rather than vertically. In La loi there is a single theme, monodic, modal, monolithic. Melodic lines and percussive rhythms, unharmonised, 'breathe' like the forest itself, with no development, only repetition which, slightly varied, becomes tor- toise-paced evolution. Gradually, monody expands into organum in parallel fourths and fifths, which doesn't affect monophonic princi- ples. Such change as there is thus resembles Nature herself who, having her own (to us elusive) law, is not identical with chaos. The acuity of Koechlin's ear in 'hearing' this monody is remark- able; and the second movement, Les bandar-log (perhaps signifi- cantly written in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War), is recognised as one of the masterpieces of 20th-century orchestral writing. Its cunning is related to the fact that this is the further the jungle gets from Nature's primal law: for it is about monkeys, the creatures closest to man, through whose frantic antics Nature aspires to 'consciousness'. The music begins predictably in a poly- modality springing from Nature's primeval fourths and fifths. But Nature's quietude is soon disturbed by the gibbering simians, whose fragmented squwarks are scored with vivid virtuosity. Academic fugue is a negative force in this polytonal, polymetrical piece, as it is in Ives' comparable Fourth Symphony, written more than twenty years earlier. The coda to this polymorphous scherzo reaffirms Nature's fourth- and fifth-founded infinitudes; timelessly, the jungle survives our apish assaults. In this monkey-movement Nature veers towards man; in La medita- tion de Parun-Baghat (1936) man tries to identify with Nature. The hero of Kipling's tale (not from the Jungle books) is a government The Miusical Times 512 August 1994</page><page sequence="2">official who relinquishes the trammels of power to commune with God in the mountains. The piece begins with a drone, over which murmurs a monody: but whereas the monody of the first movement is both lawful and awe-ful, this monody is expansive, turning into religious incantation that sounds both occidental (Christian) and ori- ental (Buddhist). Imperceptibly, monody flowers into polyphony, the open spaces of which link Koechlin's music of winds and mountains to his civilised, quasi-medieval and renaissance French works. Moreover, the fourths, fifths and ninths recall too the open spaces of a New World composer, Aaron Copland; and there is again an affinity with the nature-mysticism of Ives' great Concord sonata. Koechlin's nature-mysticism has much in common with that of the part-time her- mit of Walden Pool. This music is an opting-out that evades the ten- sion - typical of the surging rhythms and wailing appoggiaturas of Delius's Song of the high hills - between mortal human passion and the mountains' immortal imperviousness. The last, longest, and finest of the symphonic poems was the first to be composed, though, as noted, it was 16 years in gestation. Inspired by Kipling's wonderful tale about Mowgli's leaving the jungle at the belated onset of puberty, it amounts to a summation of Koechlin's techniques, and inspired Milhaud, Koechlin's younger contemporary, to hazard that it was a seed from which would spring the most forward-looking music of the next genera- tion. With no barriers between tonality, polymodality and atonali- ty, La course du printemps evokes the stirring of spring in man and beast. Its kaleidoscopic strucutre emulates the life force, from the nature murmurs of the beginning, through the chitter of birds and the yowls of animals, to the thudding of Mowgli's padding feet and pounding heart. Driven by burgeoning sexuality, the music seeks a restored whole. It stops and starts, uncertain of when and where; again, the scrunchy, sappy sonorities remind us of Ives' nature musics, effecting a collocation of opposites which - like Ives' whirling waters and independently parading bands - merge into nature's eternal present. The form is a vast rondo (lasting over half an hour), since after each 'running' the forest returns to near- immobility: only for the next running to take off even more strenu- ously, to climax with creaturely commotion in full pelt. Mowgli bounds back from the jungle to human life which nonetheless, after this rite of initiation, will never be the same. As the coda reinstates the jungle-in-itself, the work closes on an Ivesian Unanswered Question, which proves to be Koechlin's green message to human kind. The Koechlin of Le course du printemps and the Ives of the Fourth Symphony are both religious composers, albeit beyond the range of accredited creeds; and it is significant that the coda brings Koechlin's jungle close to Copland's empty prairie, or even to his nocturally lonesome New York. These CDs by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus under David Zinman places the three early choral and orchestral pieces first, which is fair enough. The four purely orchestral move- ments are not, however, performed in the order Koechlin intended, but in chronological sequence. To yourself, you should play them in the 'right' order: for we need to begin with Nature's Law; to proceed therefrom to the threat posed to it by the cannily anthropomorphic monkeys; to counter that with man's attempt to recover, through tran- scendence, the Whole; and so to leap into the rebirth of the enthralling Spring Running. Koechlin would have considered it sac- riligeous to close with those scarily scherzoid apes. Even so, these performances earn our gratitude. The choral pieces, though not yet vintage Koechlin, come out as undeniably impressive, especially the Seal lullaby (set in the frozen north rather than the Indian jungle), in which Kipling's haunting words are lus- trously sung by the soloist Iris Vermillion, while chorus and orches- tra induce potent magic through soaring lines, wordless vocalise, and shimmering orchestral sonorities closer to the Ravel of Daphnis et Chloe than to Debussy. In the mature symphonic poems the monody of the jungle's law might have been starker and grander; but the monkey-music is dazzlingly realised, while the hermit's meditation in the mountains really does 'take off'. Zinman sustains momentum through the apparent vacillations of La course du print- emps which, though the work of a composer usually considered marginal, is one of the most startlingly original and life-enhancing contributions to the orchestral music of our century. I suspect that it is too demanding - on listeners as well as performers - to achieve the 'fabulous' (if also peripheral) fame or notoriety of G6recki's Third Symphony or Tavener's Repentant thief, but I hope that these discs will help to establish Koechlin's Jungle book at the heart of the repertory, where it should have been long since.
