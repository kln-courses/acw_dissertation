<plain_text><page sequence="1">II. Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL INTRODUCTION The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) was established in 19971 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by members of the general public. Funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) enabled the extension of the PAS to cover the whole of England and Wales during 2003. The PAS was funded until 31 March 2006 by the HLF and local partners and is being funded from April 2006 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and local partners. Surveys of Roman period finds recorded by the PAS have been published in Britannia in 2004 and 2005. This third report adopts the same layout with a brief overview of finds distribution followed by descriptions of significant individual artefacts and assemblages. OVERVIEW 52,094 artefacts were recorded on the PAS database in 2005, 17,992 (34.5 per cent) of which date to the Roman period. This figure includes those finds to which a date has been attributed that spans the late Iron Age and early Roman period. This total compares with 9,915 Roman finds (45.8 per cent of all finds) recorded in 2003 and 16,579 (42.3 per cent) in 2004. The 2005 data include 5,047 pottery sherds and 197 tile fragments. Otherwise the artefacts recorded are predominantly metallic, although small quantities of artefacts made in stone (2), glass (25), bone (21), shale (2), and jet (5) were also documented. Many of the finds recorded by the PAS come from sites which have been damaged or eroded, usually by agriculture. In some cases the artefactual evidence may be the only surviving trace of past activity at an individual location. Of the Roman artefacts reported during 2005, approximately 62 per cent were discovered by metal-detector users. However, more unusual recovery circumstances should also be noted. 909 Roman artefacts recovered by divers from the river Tees at Piercebridge, Durham, were recorded by the PAS during 2005, as were 110 Roman objects collected over 30 years through beach-combing the inter-tidal zone at Canvey Island, Essex. Table 1 shows the numbers and distribution of Roman non-ceramic artefacts reported by county (grouped by PAS region) during 2005. These figures are based on the PAS database. It should be noted that not all finds recorded from Norfolk are currently entered in the database, although the proportion is increasing in comparison to previous years.2 Artefacts that qualify as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 are excluded from this survey, but are published in the Treasure Annual Report by the DCMS. For convenience of presentation and to enable comparison with other datasets, the subdivision of artefacts by function is based on the scheme proposed by Crummy,3 with some modifications. Coins (70.5 per cent) are the 1 Pilot projects were established in Kent, Norfolk, the West Midlands, North Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and the North-West in September 1997, followed by projects in Hampshire, Somerset and Dorset, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, and Wales in January 1999. During 2003 the PAS expanded to cover the remaining English counties. 2 Owing to the very high number of artefacts presented for identification in Norfolk, only a proportion is currently available on the PAS database. Records of other artefacts are entered into the Norfolk Historic Environment Record. 3 N.

Coins most numerous find: the percentage recorded in 2005 is consistent with that in 2004 (72.8 per cent) and 2003 (72.7 per cent). Brooches constitute 13.9 per cent and other items of personal adornment represent 3.8 per cent, proportions which are again consistent with those recorded in 2004 of 14.3 and 3.8 per cent respectively. Category D, which includes household utensils, furniture fittings, copper-alloy vessels, keys, weights, and textile equipment, comprises 4.8 per cent (3.1 per cent in 2004) of artefacts reported. All other categories are represented by very small numbers, although the greater quantity of first- to third-century military equipment recorded (112 in 2005, 61 in 2004) is worthy of note. FIG. 1 shows the distribution of findspots of non-ceramic finds. To a limited extent the distribution continues to be skewed towards counties where the PAS is longest established (e.g. Suffolk, Northamptonshire, Hampshire), but overall there is a broader and more even distribution of findspots across South, Central and North-East England in comparison to previous years. In some counties where the scheme has only been in operation since 2003 very considerable numbers of artefacts are now being recorded (e.g. Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Wiltshire). An increase in the absolute quantity of artefacts recorded is particularly noticeable in Durham, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. It should be remembered that in some counties the large quantities recorded derive from a comparatively small number of findspots from which large artefact collections, derived from detecting over many years on single sites, were recorded in 2005. This phenomenon is illustrated at Piercebridge, Durham (866), Elveden, Suffolk (673), Hayton, East Yorks. (620), and Norton, Northants. (325). There is also regional variation in types as well as quantities of artefact recorded. In the 18 counties from which more than 100 coins have been recorded, the proportion of the total finds represented by coins has been calculated. The average percentage for these counties is 74.2 per cent, but the proportion varies from 48.9 per cent in Leicestershire to 94.7 per cent in East Yorkshire. Brooches account for 13.9 per cent of the total non-ceramic artefacts recorded, but the 431</page><page sequence="4">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2005 FIG. 1. Distribution of findspots of Roman non-ceramic artefacts recorded in 2005. proportions in Suffolk (7 per cent) and in counties with more than 100 brooches recorded, e.g. Leicestershire (29 per cent), illustrate the range of variation. Brooches typically dominate the combined categories of personal adornment (Table 1, A and B), but in Essex they comprise an unusually low 48 per cent of these combined groups. A high number of objects related to writing (E), items of military equipment (I), and studs/mounts (K) have been recorded in Durham, again reflecting the anomalous composition of the Piercebridge finds. The research potential of PAS data has previously been emphasised in these summaries. It must 432</page><page sequence="5">SALLY WORRELL be stressed that users should take account of the processes by which the data have accumulated. While some characteristics of the data seem to be reasonably well-established, for example the relative proportions of certain types of find, chance factors of the types referred to above can have a significant impact on annual statistics and patterns need to be established on the basis of records compiled as the Scheme develops. The entries below set out some of the highlights of the past year's discoveries recorded by Finds Liaison Officers.4 Fuller details of the finds recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme can be obtained from the Scheme's central office5 and there are full descriptions of finds on the PAS website: www.finds.org.uk. The reference number in brackets is the PAS identifying find record,6 with the exception of the arm-purse and lamp from near Tadcaster, North Yorks. (see below) which was reported as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.7 NORTH YORKSHIRE (1-2) Tadcaster area (Treasure case: 2005 T268) (FIGS 2-3).8 A copper-alloy lamp, a copper- alloy arm-purse, and four denarii were reported as potential treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. The arm-purse (FIG. 2) is annular and has a broad, bracelet-like hoop which has a smooth, plain, lightly-cambered inner face. Its cambered exterior face has a central channelled rib and a panel of rather rudimentarily incised, rectilinear decoration at the junction with both ends of the purse. The purse is hollow and leech-shaped, with the normal six-facetted exterior surface. One side is broken away. Only two small unattached fragments of the hinged lid survive. The larger piece retains the full width of the hinged end of the plate, a folded sheet riveted together and enclosing its axis pin. The width corresponds to that of the purse, which, in its complete wall, preserves one of the locating holes for the end of the axis pin. Where the original surface is visible, on the exterior of hoop and purse, a degree of wear is apparent. Roman copper-alloy arm-purses appear to have been principally, if not exclusively, a male, military accoutrement, with examples found both in auxiliary and legionary contexts in Britain and on the Continent. British examples include those from Birdoswald (2 examples), Corbridge, South Shields, Thorngrafton (near Housesteads), Colchester, Wroxeter, Silchester, and Farndale. Two types have been distinguished, depending on whether the hoop is flexible (with a sliding fastening of the type seen on contemporary bracelets) or rigid.9 The present arm-purse belongs to the latter category, most examples of which have plain hoops of varying cross-section, though several are decorated at the junction with the purse, and a few have a continuous zone of ornament round the hoop. A second/third-century date is likely for this purse. The maximum external dimensions are 109.8 by 106.9 mm, the maximum internal dimensions 101 by 74 mm, the hinge is 20.5 mm wide and the purse weighs 149 g. The first- or second-century lamp (FIG. 3) is cast in copper alloy and modelled in plastic form. The main body of the lamp comprises a finely-modelled female head, probably that of a maenad, set against an acanthus moulding that encircles the ribbed oval base. Her elaborately-coiffured 4 Throughout the year, staff in the British Museum, in particular Ralph Jackson, J.D.

The knobbed, voluted nozzle, which projects beneath her chin, has a circular wick-hole. The ornate moulded ring-handle is surmounted by a funnel-like, circular filling-hole, with ridged rim and indented floral- or leaf-patterned flange, and a large handle ornament in the form of a vine-leaf. The lamp was cast with the interior of the base open: the sheet bronze base-plate, probably soldered in position, is now missing, as is the upper part of the handle's leaf ornament.

An example from Fenchurch Street, London" is in the form of the figure of Silenus wreathed in ivy and seated on a wine-skin. Like the present example it recalls the Bacchic revel, so popular as a motif in Roman art. The lamp weighs 270.7 g, is 115 mm long, and 63 mm high; the handle is 50.8 mm wide and the head is 46.6 mm wide. LANCASHIRE (3) Slyne with Hest (LANCUM-361F75) (FIG. 4).12 An enamelled copper-alloy container, now in three joining fragments which make up the head, neck and body of a cockerel. The legs are broken off and the tail and wattle, which was cast separately and attached to the underside of the beak with a short lug, are missing. The bird's detached back is decorated with irregularly- arranged, square and near-square cells inlaid with red and blue enamel. The chest is decorated with rows of triangular and arched cells inlaid with blue, green, and red enamel arranged in a pyramidal format. The second, fourth, and sixth rows are in blue and the third and fifth have alternating red and green cells. The enamel in the uppermost row is missing. The eyes are represented by a central dot of blue enamel surrounded by a ring of red enamel. The cockerel's back and wings were cast separately and acted as a lid to the container, although there is no trace of a hinge or other fitting. Traces of the clay core from the mould still remain inside the head and neck. The cockerel is 123 mm high, 101 mm long and 52 mm wide across the widest part of the chest. Only a few such vessels, which probably date to the late second/early third century, are known from the North-Western provinces. Similar examples are known from Cologne,13 London,14 Enamel Key Red I Green n Blue FIG. 4. Slyne with Hest, cockerel (No. 3). Scale 1:2. (Drawn by P.

The cockerels from Tongeren and Slyne with Hest are remarkably similar, both in their size and enamelled decoration, and are possibly products of the same workshop. The bird from Tongeren still has its circular wattle and stands on a pedestal. These objects are usually identified as oil lamps and it is likely that the example from Slyne with Hest could have served this function.17 However, the shape of the cockerels from London and Cologne and the soldering of their wings to the back of the bird would make it difficult to refill them with oil.18 LINCOLNSHIRE (4) Fulbeck (SWYOR-BFE1C5) (FIG. 5).19 An unusual copper-alloy plate brooch in the form of a seated greyhound which survives in an excellent condition.20 The brooch is very finely cast and finished. The form of the dog is well-observed and anatomically correct, though slightly stylised. The eye is large, the ear long and down-turned, the tapered muzzle long with slightly parted lips. The curved body sits on muscular haunches, the legs are long and slender, and the waist is hollowed and divided from the shoulders by a clearly-depicted rib-cage. The front surface and the rim of the hollow-cast back have been tinned. At the base of the brooch there is a small triangular field which represents the ground that the dog sits on; set on the back of the triangle is a single pierced pin lug with the remains of the corroded iron pin. The obliquely- slotted catch-plate is intact. The brooch weighs 15.8 g and is 45.2 mm high, 22.5 mm wide, and 16 mm thick. Parallels for this second-century brooch are difficult to find. The only similar, but less accomplished example is said to have been found in Syria.21 FIG. 5. Fulbeck, greyhound brooch (No. 4). Scale 1:1. (Drawn by A.

The object is in the form of a stylised sea creature which is probably intended to represent a dolphin. The head is slightly lowered and the body slightly arched, giving the appearance of movement through water. The wide snout is triangular in cross-section, gently curving upwards and widening at the face. Beneath the snout is an integral rectangular lug, 18 mm long and 5 mm thick, with a circular perforation with a diameter of 2 mm at its end. The central ridge of the snout continues up the centre of the face and forms a long narrow crest, now very worn, on the top of the head. The dolphin's face is decorated with two lozenge-shaped, moulded eyes set within two pairs of wide, concentric, moulded crescentic lids. Immediately behind each eye is a moulded elongated triangle with the apex touching the rear of the eye, probably representing ears. The body is hollow and semi-cylindrical in cross-section. The back of the dolphin tapers gradually to the beginning of the tail at which point a small, vertical fin is seen in the centre. Beneath this fin is a second pierced integral lug. The narrow, solid tail points upwards and is semi-cylindrical in section; there is no sign of a broad tail fin. The head, apart from the snout, and the back close to the tail, are decorated with well-executed conjoined and single crescent-shaped stamps, representing scales. The handle is 125 mm long, 27 mm wide, and 33 mm thick. A handle in the form of a dolphin is known from Catterick, North Yorks.23 It has the dolphin mounted on a rectangular-sectioned stem and also has a hollow body and a solid stem and tail. FIG. 6.

Eight projections, representing rays, of which only four remain largely intact, frame the head. The nose is wedge- shaped and the facial features are rather worn, but the hair, formed by moulded scroll motifs, survives well. The drapery is indicated by a pair of parallel lines which run from each shoulder and meet at the centre of the chest. The reverse of the bust is undecorated and the back extends to the mid-point of the chest. The base is flat, oval in plan, and concave. Internally there are traces of solder and also perhaps some ceramic material. The bust is 39 mm high, 30 mm wide; internally it measures 22 mm by 11 mm and weighs 41 g. A bust of Sol wearing a richly-patterned paludamentum is known from Cottenham, Cambs.,25 and a more stylised example was found at Uley, Glos.26 FIG. 7. Osbournby, bust of Sol (No. 6). Scale 1:1.

The lion emerges from a calyx of four leaves. The animals are executed with considerable attention to detail, with the lion's mane, paws, back, and underside pecked to represent fur - an unusual feature on keys of this type. Inside the lion's open mouth there are several small holes which are likely to have once held teeth. The ram has small patches of silver in each eye. The handle is 114.5 mm long, 44.2 mm high, 29.4 mm wide at the square socket, and 27.8 mm wide across the lion's body. The socket has traces of iron corrosion within it and at its edges from the missing iron key for a tumbler lock. Key handles in the form of lions holding animal heads are rare. A similar example is known from Shepton Mallet, Somerset,28 and from Bavai there are two examples with a lion grasping a boar's or ram's head.29 An unusual variant is a key handle found at Brampton, Norfolk, which 24 Found by T.

The mounts were found metres apart and are likely to have originally been attached to the same vessel or casket. Both mounts are sub-circular with semi-circular hollow cross-sections and have very similar facial features. The almond-shaped eyes are defined by a groove. On one mount one eye also has a hollow recess (WAW-2EFFB6). Very fine grooves define the eyebrows. The flat, wedge-shaped nose is slightly damaged on one example (WAW-2EFFB6). The mouth is indicated by a fine horizontal groove, the chin is poorly defined, and the round face is bordered by a flange, which is slightly offset. Approximately one third of the flange is missing from one of the mounts (WAW-2EFFB6). The hair is depicted on the upper half of the flange by vertical and oblique linear grooves. The hollow backs contain traces of lead. The fill of one (WAW-2EFFB6) is concave and there is an irregular central hole. The mounts are comparable in size; one (WAW-2F4145) is 32.65 mm long, 29.45 mm wide, 10.85 mm thick, and weighs 15.6 g and the other (WAW-2EFFB6) is 32.2 mm long, 30.1 mm wide, 10.4 mm thick, and weighs 20.3 g.

The tiers are shaped like small tables with a large central, circular hole, knopped projections at each corner to secure the legs of the upper tier, and small circular perforations placed slightly in from each projection. There is a panel on each side with elaborate blue and turquoise enamel decoration. The dimensions of the lower tier are 32 by 32 by 30 mm and those of the upper tier are 24 by 22 by 31 mm. The two tiers are generally in good condition, although a large part of one side of the lower tier is missing. A stand, with almost identical decoration but in turquoise and green enamel, and also missing its top tier, was found at Catterick, North Yorks.41 The Wadenhoe stand was discovered less than a mile from the Roman shrine at Brigstock where another altar/stand was discovered with the same decorative motifs as the smaller stand, but with red and blue enamel.42 39 Henig, op. cit.

The object is modelled in the round and is largely complete. It depicts a standing female deity facing forward, her right arm bent upwards at the elbow in the action of throwing a now-missing spear, and a cornucopia held in the crook of her bent left arm. She wears a Greek-style helmet with a double keyhole-shaped depression for a plume attachment; the helmet is pushed back above the eyes revealing a corona of hair beneath. At the back of her head, the hair is plaited into three tresses emerging from beneath the helmet and running down the nape of the neck to end between the shoulder blades. The facial features are very worn, but eyes, nose, and a mouth are evident. The neck is bare. On the torso is a cuirass of scale armour with traces of a Medusa aegis on the breastplate. Beneath the cuirass she wears a long, pleated peplos, gathered into folds, and covering her to the ankles. There is no sign of feet, although a small circular hole underneath may indicate that the figurine was once attached to a plinth. There is no known parallel for this piece, which appears to incorporate significant elements of Athena-Tyche, the Greek equivalent of Minerva-Fortuna. Given its findspot and the attributes of the newly-discovered goddess, Senuna,44 the figurine from Hinxworth may represent Senuna-Minerva-Fortuna. The figurine probably dates from the first or second century. The condition of the piece is reasonable, although the surface is orange-brown due to a layer of iron corrosion; this may have come from an associated iron object, or may be the result of iron panning in the surrounding soil. Pitting of this surface is due to the incomplete formation of this iron corrosion layer. The figurine is 63 mm high, 28 mm wide, 10 mm thick and weighs 41.3 g.

A prominent knurled rib representing the dorsal crest runs its length and the body, legs, and back of the ears are decorated with horizontal and oblique incised lines which schematically represent hair. The boar's head is triangular with a straight lower edge and the ears are upright, rounded, and forward-facing. The flat-ended snout is simplistically rendered and no other facial features are represented; the head is smooth and there are no tusks. A small, circular-sectioned lug extends from the back of the boar which is probably intended to represent a tail, although it may be casting waste. The base is thin-walled and would have provided little support, but may have been the means by which the boar was attached to another object. The boar is 45 mm long, has a maximum width of 20 mm, and a height of 27 mm. The boar is less realistically portrayed and lacks much of the attention to detail seen on the boar figurine from Camerton, Somerset, for example.46 OXFORDSHIRE (14) Chinnor (BERK-41B625) (FIG. 15).47 An unusual copper-alloy harness-fitting, probably a pole-mounted terret. It comprises two conjoined circular hoops aligned side by side and attached to a base or 'skirt'. Each of the hoops has a triangular cross-section with the apex at the inner edge, and a diameter of approximately 23.5 mm. The base is in the form of an inverted pelta, with bevelled outer edges and midway along each long edge is a peak with a knop projection, one of which is largely missing. The concave base has a lead filling surrounding a central, roughly oval depression which contains iron corrosion from the missing mount for attachment. FIG. 15. Chinnor, harness-fitting (No. 14).

Pole- and strap-mounted terrets frequently have a base or skirt, which is often either rectangular or scalloped in shape to cover part of the fitting, which is most frequently, but not exclusively made of iron. The terret is 54.65 mm long, 43.4 mm wide, 27.65 mm thick, and weighs 92.65g. The form of the Chinnor terret is difficult to parallel. Pole-mounted terrets with single hoops are the most common form, with examples known from Lowbury Hill, Berks.,48 and Castleford, West Yorks.49 More unusual and elaborately-decorated pole-mounted terrets are known from King's Lynn50so and Saham Toney, Norfolk.51 Terrets with multiple perforations, rather than an open hoop, are rare; an example with a plate with three perforations is noted from Kalkriese, Osnabriick.52 (15) Near Woodstock (BERK-EF07C2) (FIG. 16).53 A figurine of a bird holding a seed in its beak, perhaps intended to represent a pigeon or dove. The bird has been cast in the round with a flat back and a fan-shaped tail. At the junction between the tail and the back there is a pronounced semi-circular depression and there is a corresponding depression on the underside of the body and tail. The body then tapers towards an angular, lozenge-shaped stand representing legs and feet. The wings are not defined and no plumage or feathers are indicated. The figurine is 39.8 mm long, 15.3 mm wide, 32.3 mm high, and weighs 22.35 g. The stand may indicate that it was intended as a fitting to decorate a box or other item of furniture.

The echinus on both faces is decorated with an anthropomorphic mask of characteristically South Italian form. The capital has a large vertical perforation, lined with lead, where it was attached to the top of the column, and from which hooked fittings for the suspension of oil lamps would have projected. The perforation has a diameter of 29 mm and the irregular hole in the lead has an approximate diameter of 14 mm.

Three-horned bulls are a well-known Gallo-Roman iconographic symbol, with the third horn perhaps indicating increased supernatural power.61 The pointed ears project from the side of the head at right angles, beneath two projecting tapering horns. Between these hornms, in the centre of the head is the remains of a third, very worn hornm. The forehead is flat and has a central longitudinal groove. The eyes are slightly protruding and are defined by a groove. The nose is short and rounded and the mouth is represented by a horizontal groove. The neck is thick and ridged with transverse mouldings defining musculature. The body is rectangular and narrow, 15 mm deep, 36.5 mm long, 10.9 mm wide across its centre and 12.8 mm wide across its hindquarters.

The bull's hind quarters are slightly rounded and the tail is to one side with its tip resting on its back, as if it is being vigorously swished from side to side. The bull has large testicles and a slight moulding representing the phallus. Both forelegs are incomplete, one leg is slightly raised, and the shoulders are muscular. The hind legs are straight and one is placed slightly in front of the other, presumably depicting a walking gait. From nose to tail the bull is 60.6 mm long and its triangular head is 22.2 mm long, 22.5 mm wide and 15.8 mm thick. The presence of the 'dorsuale' around the body suggests that the bull has been formally prepared for sacrifice, contrary to the view of bulls as divine, theomorphic substitutes for deity. Sacrificial bulls are familiar from state reliefs like the Suovetaurilia relief now in the Louvre,62 and the fragmentary Ravenna relief.63 A parallel dorsuale can be seen around the belly of a pig on a nicolo intaglio from Old Penrith.64 Other three-homed bull figurines are known from Maiden Castle, Dorset, Jewry Wall, Leicester, and Devizes, Wilts., as well as a pipe-clay figurine from Colchester, Essex.65 An additional copper-alloy three-homed bull figurine has recently been recorded by the PAS from Watlington, Oxon.

The back of the terminal is slightly concave to accommodate the body of the copper-alloy vessel, to which it would have originally been soldered. The front face of the terminal is rounded and moulded to depict a female head with a triangular head-dress, the tip of which tapers into the centre of the handle shaft. The face is almost round with moulded eyebrows above oval eyes, in which central circular indentations represent the pupils. The nose is slightly flattened and the small mouth is represented by moulded lips with a straight horizontal groove between them. The sides of the triangular head-dress frame the face and its terminals extend to below where the ears would be. It has two central, oblique grooves forming a 'V' above the forehead and either side of this there are curvilinear grooves following the line of the rim and beading along its upper tapering edges. About half way down the head-dress the handle shaft begins with two scroll-like motifs which project on either side of the head-dress. The handle shaft is rectangular with two parallel longitudinal grooves either side of a central ridge and is 14 mm wide and 7.5 mm thick. The handle is 51 mm in total surviving length and weighs 47.3 g. The complete terminal is oval, approximately 32 mm long, 23.2 mm wide, and 10 mm thick.

The boar's head is simply rendered and has an integral, sub-circular back-plate from which the animal's head projects. The peaked brow extends to the snout. Beneath the snout is a wedge-shaped indent that forms the open mouth and short lower jaw of the boar. The animal's ears rise vertically from the back of the head and have circular indents on the front to represent their folds. The head of the boar is otherwise plain, with no attempt to render the eyes or any other features. The tusk, which is rectangular in section, extends horizontally from the back of the head and then sweeps upwards and slightly back on itself and gently tapers to a blunt point. Beneath the tusk, just beyond the head, is a transverse, circular loop, presumably for suspension. The object is 105.6 mm long, of which 36.9 mm is the boar's head; the head is 23.3 mm wide across the back-plate and 12.1 mm wide at the snout. The tusk is 18 mm wide at the broadest point and 9.5 mm thick and it is 5.6 mm wide at the tapered end. The loop has an external diameter of 20.1 mm. The object weighs 182.39 g. A copper-alloy boar's head, tusk, and suspension loop is known from Esch, Germany, though this head is much more realistically portrayed and more artistically competent than the Great Canfield example.72 This type of object was presumably designed to be portable.

One leg is complete, with three incised lines to represent the claws and a slightly damaged paw. The other leg is missing its paw and is truncated to a length of 8.2 mm. The panther's neck is turned sideways, so that it curves back slightly on itself as if looking over its right shoulder. The head has two small, flattened ears and the face has a moulded, raised brow ridge from which runs the bridge of the nose. The mouth is open, with two teeth bridging the gap between upper and lower jaw. Running from the ear around its jaw-line is a very slight, moulded ruff with faint, diagonally-incised lines. The panther is 29.6 mm long, with the head being 15.8 mm long and 11.6 mm wide. The base of the mount is a sub-circular disc, 43 mm in diameter, that has been moulded with a curved edge and six trifoliate petals. The lower face of the disc is flat with no signs of fixing or soldering, but it was almost certainly applied to the side of a casket or other piece of furniture. Panthers are associated with the god Bacchus, and often appear in Roman art pulling his chariot or carrying him on their back. Here the emergence from the calyx may be an allusion to rebirth. There is abundant evidence for the popularity of the cult of Bacchus.76 A very similar mount has recently 75 Found by D. Wray. Record by C. McDonald. 76 B.

(23) Roxwell (ESS-E5CE07) (FIG. 24).78 The copper-alloy object is possibly a jeweller's test piece or die. It is rectangular in plan and section and is 33.1 mm long, 19.2 mm wide, 5 mm thick, and weighs 20.65 g. It is engraved at one end with a pair of clasped hands set within a circular border of dots. At the opposite end of the same face, is an engraved portrait of a Roman emperor, diademed and facing left and probably representing Julian (A.D. 355-363). In front of the portrait is the engraved word SABATIV (see below, pp. 475-6, No. 10). The back of the object is plain. The clasped hand motif - a symbol related to the junctio or marriage union - was commonly found on Roman jewellery such as finger-rings and bracelets. This object may have been used for making repousse components for jewellery, by pressing gold foil into the shallow die. The function of the portrait remains unclear, although a connection with coinage seems most likely. Although the manner by which the portrait is engraved precludes its use in the minting process, the similarity in style and size suggests it could have been copied from a coin as an 'engraving test' or perhaps even used as a draft for the production of coin dies used to strike unofficial imitations.

The cloak passes over the right arm, with vertical folds at the front, and diagonally across the back, then over the left arm before hanging down at the left flank.

The upper part, which has a circular perforation (diameter 5 mm) for attachment at the centre, is also decorated with a number of linear ridges. This section is separated from the ox's horns by a narrow moulded ridge. The horns are simple and straight, with slightly protruding, pointed ends and linear grooves in the area above the head, some of which have short transverse lines between them. There is a narrow horizontal band below this, decorated on one side by a row of small circular stamps. The ox's face is rounded in the area of the eyes and narrows and then flares out again at the nose. The circular eyes have dark blue glass settings and the area around them is decorated with wide, stamped arcs. There is a slightly irregular, oblique incised line below each eye forming a 'V' shape. The nostrils are faintly defined by two short vertical lines. Immediately below the snout, which has a flat, straight lower edge, is another circular perforation, with a diameter of 2.8 mm. The mount is flat and may therefore have adorned quite a large vessel. It is 58.5 mm long, 32 mm wide, and weighs 20.7 g.

(26) Cerne Abbas (SOMDOR-1DB306) (FIG. 27).84 A small cast copper-alloy terminal in the form of an eagle's head, possibly from a knife or razor. The terminal is partially hollow, with a cylindrical socket. The poorly-executed bird holds a small spherical object, probably representing a seed or pellet of food, in its beak. Between the beak and the eye there is a deeply- grooved, slightly curving line on either side. The eyes, unusually, are indicated by incised vert- ical, pointed ovals. Behind the eyes on each side is a vertical, pointed oval ridge, incised with six short diagonal grooves. The back of the head is decorated with five vertical grooved lines, presumably to indicate feathers. The object is 23 mm long, 19.7 mm deep, and 15 mm wide. The circular base has a diameter of 12.4 mm and it weighs 13.9 g. Terminals in the form of an eagle's head are not common finds and it is often difficult to ascribe a function with any certainty. An incomplete terminal with a cylindrical socket found in Calstone Wellington, Wilts. is similar in form to that from Cerne Abbas, although the eagle's head (also with food in its beak) is depicted as emerging from leaves.85 The function of the animal head terminal in the form of a stylised eagle or griffin head found in the canabae at Caerleon was interpreted as a possible pommel for a sword or other weapon due to the rectangular hole at the top of the head for a tang or other attachment.86 FIG. 27.

The first find, a trulleus (No. 27) was discovered with the use of a metal-detector. Following the reporting of the object to the Wiltshire Finds Liaison Officer, Wessex Archaeology was commissioned to excavate the findspot. The small-scale excavation (c. 1.8 by 1.8 m) revealed a large sub-circular feature c. 0.4 m below the ploughsoil. Within it were two more trullei and two strainer-bowls, a small quantity of pottery and animal bone.88 (27) A complete copper-alloy, deep trulleus with a bulging wall and flaring foot (FIG. 28), of Den Boesterd's Gbdakertyp. 89 There is a narrow rib and a band of white metal coating below the rim, above a band of incised palisade decoration. A further narrow rib is situated above the base. The handle, grooved on both edges, has a disc-shaped terminal with a central hole. The maker's stamp, P. CIPI. POLIBI, is located on the handle just before the terminal. The body is slightly dented and the hole torn in its side is probably the result of recent plough damage. The base has FIG. 28.

A separate D-shaped piece fits above the hole and is decorated with a sitting bird mount. A rivet-hole indicates that there would originally have been a second mount. The final element of the lid is a copper-alloy strip, decorated on the upper surface with curved stamps. The vessel has a base diameter of 92 mm, an external rim diameter of 194 mm, a depth of 102 mm, and it weighs 547 g.

The upper crescent-shaped part has knobbed terminals which meet above a horizontal bar. At either end of the bar a groove defines a broad vertical ridge before a rounded terminal. On the reverse of the bar are the remains of two square-sectioned rivets. Below the bar is a short rectangular-sectioned arm with a triangular-sectioned moulding at its centre. Below this there is a hollow-backed, large crescent-shaped element with rounded knops on either side of its upper edge and knobbed terminals. Where the terminals meet, there is an apparently phallic extension with a short D-shaped bar with a central rounded moulding. There is a square-sectioned rivet on the reverse. Both crescents have bevelled internal edges. The mount is 58.5 mm long, 30 mm wide, 5.1 mm thick, and weighs 17.9 g.

At the back of the head, the hair is defined by transverse lines which extend from both sides and meet at the centre, sometimes overlapping, forming a point just above the nape of the neck. The face is recessed slightly from the hair and the features are represented simply; the eyes are sub-circular recesses with a raised central dot, the wide nose is a raised triangle, and the mouth is two lateral grooves separated by a ridge. The ears are crudely represented by large raised triangles with a central circular recess. Beneath the head the object is waisted to form the neck before ending in a flat circular terminal from which a short rectangular- sectioned shaft projects. Considerable white metal coating remains on all surfaces, particularly the front but not on the shaft. The object is 22.25 mm long, 10.65 mm wide, and weighs 7.05 g. An object of very similar form and interpreted as a pin head, also probably representing a male, is known from Colchester.97 The object has been donated by the finder to Winchester Museums Service (Accession No. WINCM:AY 265.2).

The three- dimensional male hound is similar to the breed now known as the Irish wolf-hound. It is in a relaxed seated pose, resting on its haunches on a small integral, rectangular plinth, with its forepaws together at the front. It glances upwards slightly with its head turned to the right and its mouth closed. The nose is elongated and its cheeks are quite pronounced. The ears are erect and pointed, although the tip of the right ear is broken off. The collared neck is slender, as are the muscular haunches, torso and front legs. Its tail is curled around to the left, close to the body. Worn decorative hatching on the chest, body, haunches, right shoulder, and each cheek represents hair. The front and rear paws do not appear to have received as much attention to detail as the other elements. The hatching on the hound's right side which represents hair may originally have been present over the entire surface but has worn off in most places, perhaps as a result of frequent handling. The underside of the plinth is rough and uneven suggesting that it might have been attached to a larger object. The form of the plinth is closely paralleled by that on the fine bronze boar figurine from Camerton, Avon,99 which preserves traces of a solder fastening. The dog is 39 mm long, 35 mm wide, 13.5 mm thick, and weighs 34.72 g. The Isle of Wight hound is very similar in its naturalistic style and attention to detail, but 95 Found by P. Pynigar.
