<plain_text><page sequence="1">PupulJayakar: The Earthen Drum, New Delhi, I98o, 304 pages, zz229 illustrations, 36 in color. "The Earthen Drum" is a work of singular impor- tance. It does not treat of the great Indian monuments in stone or bronze, but uncovers the rich soil of mani- fold though coherent texture on which they came to be. The subtitle of the book calls it an introduction to the ritual arts of rural India but the text as well as the illustrations comprise a wider range. The diminu- tive reliefs found in the ancient cities of the Harappan civilization contribute essentially to the meaning of the book which does not offer a conspectus of Indian art under royal or other patronage from the third millenium B.C. to the present but treats of practically all the varieties of visual art created and used by the rural, tribal and other people of the vast country through the millennia. "The Earthen Drum" is a metaphor for the creative energy of India that quickens and reverberates in widely different forms. Where similarity is striking, as for example in the clay figurines of Zhob and Kulli in Afghanistan of the third millennium B.C. and of ritual clay figurines of Bengal, today, this paradoxi- cally shows an immediacy that defies definition while it convinces by its documentation. Each of the small objects discussed and illustrated side by side is a token of a world of magic, myth and transformation, of alchemy and yoga power. It is a world of will and creative energy that throbs deep below the high altitudes where Indian sages sought and attained liberation. Into this world of the Earth Mother and her creative energy Pupul Jayakar is an eloquent guide. She leads with knowledge, intuition and imagination. The sixteen sections of the book read easily while the structure of the text links several approaches. A summary of each section will map out the vast terri- tory covered. i) "Rural Roots", the first section, touches upon the complexity of the rural situation. It speaks of settled villages where PurSrnic gods are worshipped and coexist with household and fertility rites, the Vratas, removed from "Vedic ritual"; it tells of nomadic people at times forming settled commu- nities, and of aboriginals living in forests and mountains and having no recorded history. These three types, it is shown, are not static for history has recorded the withdrawal from cities, in repeated retreats to villages and to the mountains. The first was that of the Harappan civilization to the Deccan, followed by the Aryan invaders, a conquest which caused an "archaic people's culture based on the primacy of the female principle" to "survive in secret women's rites and fertility rituals". These introductory remarks lead the author to the pervading theme of her book, the Vratas. The author sees the "Vrityas, magicians and masters of breath control" and who "have practiced sexual rites linked to agricultural magic and fertility" as having provided the name to the Vrata-rituals, that have permeated the countryside north of the Vindhyas - and are "the ritual-bound base that conditions the life of the Hindu householder". Woman was the main participant and actor of the Vratas "which connected her to the furthermost limits of human memories when woman as priestess and seer guarded the mysteries, the ways of the numinous female". "It was around the Vratas, thou- sands of variations of which existed in city, settled village and forest that the rural arts found significant expression." "The Vrata tradition freed the parti- cipant from the inflexible hold of the great (i.e. Brahmanical) tradition." Brahmanic worship was available only to the Brahmin; "the Vrata pfji and observances were available to the woman, the non Brahmin, the Sfdra and the tribal. They brought into operation song, dance, the visual arts of picture and image making; magical formulae of incantation and gesture." The Vrata rites provided the channels through which contact with nature and life was maintained and renewed in the worship of the Earth, Sun, Water and by invoking of the energy of growing things, trees, plants and animals. The demands of sex and fertility, wealth and prosperity were trans- lated into minutely detailed rituals which gave to the vast country a common bond and vision. Vrata pro- vided a living storehouse of the archaic past con- tinually transformed into the contemporary moment through group action. The Vrata rites through the centuries were to maintain their integrity indepen- dent and parallel to the orthodox Brahmin dominated culture. Having drawn this picture of the Vrata tradi- tion, itself "ritual bound" though vital as against the "inflexible hold" of the Brahmin Aryan tradition, the author sees "two movements that emerged out of the fusion of Aryans and autochthones" and that "both these streams in their vernacular form found expression in the rural tradition." Whether the Vrityas were renegades from the Vedic fold, as some think, or came from the outside, their 96</page><page sequence="2">rites were admitted or re-admitted within the Vedic tradition. A whole book of the Atharvea Veda treats of the Vrdtya ritual; our knowledge of it stems from this source. Vrata tradition and rural tradition are not identical. Variations of the Vratas existed in the city, settled village and forest. Though it was around the Vratas that thousands of rural arts found significant expression, two movements emerged out of the fusion of Aryan (Mdrgi) and autochthonous (Desi). The creativity within the autochthonous is the paramount factor in the rural tradition. It was the Vrata tradition that pointed the way back to the origins when the Earth Mother - virgin and mother in one - held sway. It was only after the fusion of races and the crystallization of agricultural com- munities that the participation of the male god in the rituals enacted around the cycle of fertility was recognized. But this leads us into another considera- tion, that of tribal art. Before leaving the Aryan, Vedic, Brahmin tradition on the one hand and the Vrdtya tradition on the other and also the Harappan past, attention may be drawn to three illustrations, one (Fig.7, p.4), the reverse side of a Harappan seal, here called a "breast seal", apparently on account of the bipartite shape in relief in the center of its square field; the others (Fig. 13, p. 9) of "a stark, headless sightless icon of the Earth Mother" in contrast to a female (Fig. i z, p.9), with eyes, facial features and ornaments articulate and prom- inent. Fig. I3 from Nevasa, Maharashtra - of the aftermath of the Harappan culture c. 15 oo-iooo B.C. - is to illustrate the contrast with a work (Fig. i z) of "the protected culture" of Harappa (3rd millennia B.C.); the other being the "product of an unsettled people that were concerned only with the protective and the essential." The Nevasa figurine terminates at its upper end with three short stump-like projections, the two lateral ones standing for the arms, the upper in the middle, a rounded triangular shape, for the faceless head; it may be pointed out that the three protuberances are similar to those of chalcolithic figurines from Asia Minor and Greece. The author then turns to tribal art like that of the Bhils which in their Pithoras ensures fertility by in- cluding a copulating couple in their pictures. We now find ourselves in the domain of Tantra where the act of union became the focal point. Agricultural magic was fused with alchemy and Tantra. The earliest treatise on alchemy, the Rasaratnakara of Nigirjuna, is a work of the second or third century A.D. It must have been preceded by a practise of alchemy. Mrs. Jayakar speaks of the tribal origins of Tantra, - which in Orissa is known as Savari Vidyd after the tribal Savaras - and of its lowly homes. The Kubjik~i Tantra originated in the home of potters. However, "while the women operated in the magical religious domain of Mandala and Vrata ritual they played no part in the artistic tradition. This lay in the hands of the crafts- men who also were the link between the monumental forms of the great tradition and the rural gods and the tribal deities of forest and mountain. It was the artisan tradition that produced the great temples of the Pur.nic gods and also the artifacts for the tribal people. "In Tdntric art the body of the goddess was geometric abstraction as well as color." Mrs.Jayakar considers the circle, double spiral, the cross, square, triangle, svastika and the "mystical diagram" (?) at the sites of the Indus valley and in the cave art of India as establishing an ancient worship of the female divin- ity. This association of the feminine principle with pictorial abstraction is so deeply embodied in the Indian consciousness that the anthropomorphic form of the goddess never replaces the diagram but contin- ues through the centuries to coexist with it. A short section following the fundamental first sec- tion and called "The Legends of Integration" exem- plifies the Dravidisation of the country in historical times. The incorporation of Hindu gods among tribal, local, village divinities is shown by tribal legends, one of the most striking instances of trans- formation being that of Durgd Kdtydyani and Mahi- sdsura. The descent into autochthonous depths, from the sky and heaven-oriented Brdhmanical vision to earth, firmly rests on "The Veda of the Rural Tradi- tion", this being the name of the third section. It is also the name most aptly given to the Atharva Veda, a record of the religion of the autochthonous people living in settled agricultural communities. The magic conjured by the hymns of the Atharva Veda comprises the making of figures and effigies; the invocation of deified plants, of animal and bird-faced "mothers"; the Atharva Veda speaks of the power of transforming a woman into a forest tree providing healing sap for curing disease. These mantras of the Atharva Veda required accompanying ritual practices, the prepara- tion of a sacred site delimited in shape, a yantra sur- charged with energy and power, a mandala as "sensi- tized object that is the manifest form of the incarna- 97</page><page sequence="3">tion". The world of the Atharva Veda is infested by Yaksas and Pisicas, haunted by Apsarases, a world of magic and seeing that makes manifest the form of things, a world of awareness of the sap of trees and the smell of flowers, earth, and death. This is the world of Kama, sensual love. In this chapter, the author firmly establishes the roots of authochthonous Indian art, its power of transfor- mation made visible in the form of sculpture and painting where tree and woman are not only an icono- graphic theme but a seen continuity and oneness of limb, be it that of the tree's or the woman's shape. Mrs.Jayakar here also proves the context of non- figurative "abstract" art, that of the mandala as cognate with Indian figurative art, the two kinds of form - as the next chapter shows - being perennial from the Harappan civilization to the present. In the fourth section, "The Ritual Art of the Indus Valley" the transforming quality of Indian form is exemplified by the propinquity and assimilation of anthropomorphic figure and tree, also of plant and animal shape. An unmistakeable "style" of the dimin- utive relief results which however - it has to be said here - is also conditioned by the "withes" technique showing closely set parallel ridges to which the author herself refers. A circular shape like "the trans- verse form of a sea shell" whence issue long-necked animals heads, unicorn, bull, stag, tiger, in dynamic rotation (Fig.32, P.43) is interpreted by the author as implying forces of birth, life and movement - con- veying also that "from the sea forms have been born the animals of the land". This circular device we observe on the other hand is of the same kind as one extended from the feathered horns of a tiger to its lower jaw which continues the serrated circular device (Fig.44, p. 54). Because the circular movement in Fig. 32 runs counterclockwise, against the course of the sun, it is seen to link this ancient amulet to magical rites, aimed at controlling and directing the laws of nature. Mrs.Jayakar is excellent in her descriptions and elo- quent in her deductions. Still, as long as the Harappan script remains undeciphered her seductively imagina- tive inferences have to await confirmation. This in- cludes the identification of the Harappan Yogi figure as that of a Vritya. Some of the connected and/or recurrent themes tempt an interpretation like the figure of the upside down woman giving birth to a plant, and on the re- verse of the same tablet a scene of decapitation, both representations showing the same undeciphered in- scription; the versions of the tree-woman-tiger com- position are most vividly interpreted in their relation to amulets (Fig. 5 1, p. 59) of near recent date. On the other hand the manner in which the woman of the "tree-woman-tiger" scheme is shown (Fig.42 as against Fig.44) "abstract" (Fig.4z) in one relief and voluptuously fleshed out (Fig. 44) in the other, though not further commented upon makes it clear that within one theme and one particular composition the most contrasting styles could be used, each of great power. The tiger (Fig.44) shows both styles, the full- bodied naturalism which is overlaid and combined with the "withes" style. It may also be noticed that the heads of the tiger and woman in Fig. 44 are graced with horns - "the sacred buffalo horns of magic" while both tiger and woman are without them in another relief (Fig. 42). Whether most sensitively "abstract" or equally sensi- tively naturalistic the theme involving tree, tiger and woman is rendered with equal immediacy, whether the linear and feathery "plant style" prevails or the opulent, naturalistic "animal" style - in which most of the bulls, buffalos and unicorns - not considered in this book - in other Harappan reliefs excel. The interpretation of the Harappan reliefs as long as their inscriptions remain undeciphered cannot but be tentative, though they may be less tentative than any of the interpretations of the script. While the latter has no analogy in any other script, figures and scenes of the clay reliefs and their rendering have their analogies and continuity in equally diminutive repre- sentations, though in a different technique. The silver amulets of recent centuries from Maharashtra re- presenting the goddess (Figs. 5 1, z 3 z, z33, z 38) are as suggestive of plant symbolism as are her feathery, mimosa-like lineaments in the Harappan tablets. To what extent this transformation of the "anthropo- morphic" goddess into forms of vegetation is trans- mitted by the respective relief techniques may not be left out of consideration. In both types, the Harappan clay amulets and the silver amulets, the assimilation to and transformation into vegetation shapes is visually compelling. The first section of the book attempts to reveal the "rural roots" by projecting back into the far distant past the heritage of later ages collected in the hymns of the Atharva Veda, as also in the Tintric tradition, and the flowering of alchemy. This a-historic method has its justification for some of the hymns collected 98</page><page sequence="4">in the Atharva Veda might have pre-existed this col- lection just as "Tdntric" practices must have preceded Tdntric doctrines and terminology. A bond of magic links the Atharva Veda, the Tantras and alchemy to their autochthonous roots. Similarly, while tribal legends show the transforma- tion of Hindu gods and their incorporation in local village deities, the latter are autochthonous, more ancient than the Hindu gods who became transposed into their likeness. By backward projection the "grdma devatds" seems to be at the root of the Pur.nic Hindu god who, once more transformed, returns to his point of origin. The numerous Harap- pan reliefs of buffalo and the appearance of buffalo horns on many of the theriomorphic and anthropo- morphic figures of the Harappan amulets show the mythical importance of the buffalo. The buffalo demon, antagonist of the great goddess as Durgi in the Purdnas - is known as an incarnation of Siva, in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh. In section three, one of the most significant chapters of the book, Mrs. Jayakar shows how in the Atharva Veda the focus of the earlier Vedas shifted from sky to earth, how the plants in their sacred presence on earth were praised, as healers having magic powers and "deified make manifest the forms of things". This is the world of the Vrdtya, a fusion of magic and vision. Mrs.Jayakar sees the figure of the Vrdtya as the arch "yogi" who had the power to awaken the earth in the solstitial rites where the bard and the prostitute in his retinue performed ritual intercourse to make fertile the earth. The magical rites necessitated tools to make them effective. These were the yantras by which the powers were confined in geometrical closed forms accom- panied by spells and incantations. The geometrical shape, the triangle being the simplest - by confining the power, defined it and became its symbol. The rites of magic and witchcraft on the other hand if directed against a person required an image or effigy of the person against whom they were directed. Yantra and mandala, accompanied by mantra and mudrI, uttered sound forms and significant hand gestures (mudri) can be traced back to the Atharva Veda as also the images made of the animal-faced goddess and the effigies in human shape of the des- tined victim, the adversary in human shape. It is the yantra/mandala, the enclosed sacred space that holds the surcharged energy and power "that is the pivot of the rural arts of India." Mrs. Jayakar sees some of their forms represented on the Harappan amulets and, in backward projection sees the figure of the yogi on these 'amulets' as pre-figuring the Vrdtya. Worn on the body the amulet was a portable shrine drawing the wearer of the amulet within the field of protection. It is by "The Oral Tradition" (section 5) that the vocabulary of the knowledge was disseminated, by Vedic bards, by court minstrels and by wandering holy men. The Aryan[?] Vrdtya priests were dissemi- nators of the magical knowledge that yogis practised. These were - we must mention - not the yogis seeking release. The yogis in question sought and had the powers of the magician-sorcerer; they summoned this power by means of their own otherwise dormant energy. They sought and projected this energy with the help of the magic diagrams. With these they evoked the power of the dormant goddess, the Kun- dalini. Her worship is through her yantra, a triangle a mathematical abstraction. It is in this way that the goddess is invoked and acquires the shape of woman. Athough "the goddess has no image" once conjured she may be seen in that likeness. The Tdntric elabora- tions of the forms of the goddess are explicit. Her supremacy in the Tantras rest on her felt presence - in the spells of the Atharva Veda - in trees, in plants and animals who contribute to her shape or that of her incarnations as "village" or "grdma" devatds. The presence of the goddess reverberates in the pages of "The Earthen Drum" - a metaphor of the body of the young woman who offers her body to her singer to play on her so as to bring out her music, (cf. a tribal poem, cited on p. 3). The rural traditions, popularized by bards and con- veyed in the vernacular, by the tenth century had become subjacent to the lyricism of songs which by that time celebrated in Kima the God of Love in his incarnation as Krishna, the dark, aboriginal hero and "phallic" god and his male role in his love for Rddhd. The "Radha-Krishna" consciousness is expressed in Jgyadeva's Gita Govinda of the twelfth century. Mrs. Jayakar attributes the ascension of the male god in the rural consciousness through the assertion of the male principle divinised in the Aryan mind. The flood of emotion released in vernacular poetry, "The Apa- bhramriSa and the Debi", (section 6) also coincides with the slow integration of Hindu and Muslim culture on the village level. During the centuries of Muslim invasions and suprem- acy traditional Indian cultural life withdrew into the 99</page><page sequence="5">interior of the country, to rural societies where the tribal Ahir, Gond, Baiga and Savara added to the Krishna legend their own ecstatic expressions. All the time however settled village society had followed the annual rhythm of the sun and the monthly course of the moon in rites that celebrated and cooperated with the movement of the luminaries. In "The Paintings of Settled Village Societies" (sec- tion 7), yantras are an essential part of the rituals of agricultural seasons not only but also of the rites of passage, like the initiation and the rites for the dead. Spells and ritual diagrams to ensure the fertility of crops, the potency of the bridegroom, the destruction of witches, the protection from tigers have each their own form, dot, triangle, square, hexagon, circle, spi- rals, etc. These function as power centers. Ultimately these power-centers are seats of the active presence of the goddess whether they are employed by peasant householders, yogis, alchemists or tantric adepts. The seven first chapters are fundamental for under- standing the extant types of rural art preserved and practised today. Foremost among them are the "Bhitti Chitras" or wall paintings of Mithila (sec- tion 8). Their vitality, range and perfectedness is a miracle witnessed. Mrs. Jayakar in person was instru- mental in bringing about the prodigious efflorescence of a village tradition that nearly had died out by 1950 o When as a relief measure after the drought of 1968, Mrs.Jayakar provided the women with means to paint and communicated to them her enthusiasm, they began to remember and continue a tradition that had survived in but a few paintings or their mere traces. The "Madhubani" paintings are celebrations of fertil- ity that were to transform the bleak, dried-out country side. They worked their magic through a wealth of pictorial control and an inexhaustible range of creative power awakened in the women of Mithila. The surety of line in which symbols and mythical figures enliven at ritually given occasions the walls of the houses - and by now also paintings on cloth and paper - is constant irrespective of the unmistakable, individual quality of the work of each of the painters. By now, a second, young generation of women painters en- riches the Madhubani tradition. It has not become mannered nor lost its integrity. The several phases of the re-awakened tradition are described by Mrs. Jayakar. At the back of the miraculously re-awakened creativity and confidence of the Madhubani women painters lies the rich historical past of the region which contributed to and did not break the ritual context of life in Mithila. Section 9, "The Mandalas and Magical Drawings" treats of the mandalas of yogic inner experience and as magical tools such as those by which the dead are freed from their ghost state and become "ancestors" (pitr). This type ofyantra is placed below the anthropo- morphic image of the goddess invoked. In current practice the magic mandalas of invoked power and its anthropomorphic image of deity coexist as a result of the mobility and commingling of tribal and rural traditions. The next section (io) considers the Vrata Mandalas in particular. These are liturgical drawings serving rites described in the Kaulika Satra several centuries after the Atharva Veda. There are over two thousand Vratas, some common to the whole of India, others "local receptacles of authochthonous rites". No priest participates. Women draw the diagrams on walls and floor. Incantations in a secret, initiatory language accompany the drawings. "The archetypal diagram is the channel through which the energy of living things can be tapped and made operative in rites of transfor- mation". "The root of Vrata rituals lies in the belief that desire when visualized and made concrete through mandala and activated through spell and ritual gesture generates an energy that ensures its own fulfillment." Through the mandalas the participants seek protection from the malignant forces of nature. These magical practices pervade Hinduism. They were according to Grhya Sitras and Manu Smrti obligatory for the Hindu householder. The Vrata mandalas, considered as a kind of "writ- ing" are an extreme type of rural art. The other end of its range is the narrative painting (Section ii "Paintings as Kathd or Story"). Their varieties in the several rural centers of India show the lively - at times banal - work of painters, some of whom are tribal converts to Hinduism - while others work on different levels of magic and/or communication. The exhibition of these paintings - all by men - is accom- panied by recitations and songs. Mrs.Jayakar never falters in characterizing each regional type of painting and performance. When turning to "- the pictographs [of tribal people], the Warlis, the Bhils, the Gonds, the Sabaras" (sec- tion I2), their magical character, and high visual com- petence work together to promote fertility, avert dis- ease, propitiate the dead and fulfill the demands of ghost and spirits. By painting the picture and in- IOO</page><page sequence="6">cluding the object desired, the result is achieved and the spirit is satisfied. Women of the tribe do not participate in the paintings of the mysteries. The artists, as with the Sabaras are magician-priests. In the final four chapters, devoted to sculpture, Mrs. Jayakar admits that it is impossible to ascertain when cult images of Grdma Devatds appeared first in rural shrines as the tribal population had been exposed for centuries to the culture of settled villages. Of greater importance than this statement is the question when the earliest movement towards form caused a turning away from the unhewn piece of stone smeared with vermillion and worshipped, to a recognizeable "like- ness" of divinity. Plaques cast in metal, showing the face of a deity, would be placed over the aniconic stone. It is well to remember that the tribal people had no craftsmen of their own and that their needs for tools and ritual objects were met by rural crafts- men who lived within the tribal environment where they absorbed the rhythms, ideas, dreams and visions of the tribal painters - who painted but were not makers of objects. The same crafts tradition supplied also the need of the villagers. "In the hands of the image maker the gods of the tribe and village fused". There is hardly a type of rural image whose Hindu genealogy is left untraced and whose rural transfor- mations are left unrecorded. Of greatest significance however in the context of the book are Mrs. Jayakar's deeply felt chapters (I4-I6) on the images of the "Mothers" whom she observes assuming various shapes and names from the Vindhyas to Afghanistan as they migrate, undergoing continuous transforma- tions as they absorb the ancient types of the Goddess who is virgin yet mother. The Apsaras, spirit of water and vegetation, enchanter and magician, "incandes- cent with power and mystery, linked with the earth and the secrets of fertility and death". If the Atharva Veda equates plants with the goddess, she says of herself in the Markandeya Purana: "I shall support the whole world with the life-giving vegetables I shall grow out of my body". The life of vegetation was identified with the energy of the goddess - who exacted animal sacrifice. The goddess is also wor- shipped as a bundle of flowering plants while under- neath her altar a square diagram marks her seat. Reference had already been made in an earlier con- text to images of the goddess holding her weapons and attributes while her body is formed of leaves (as on amulets from the tribal areas of Maharashtra). The animal-headed human bodies of the goddess in sculp- tures of the school of Mathura in the beginning of the present era trace their ancestry to the animal- headed goddesses of the Atharva Veda. The goddess, a composite of human, plant and animal features the power to heal and to transform, whatever her shape. Essentially she is the Virgin Earth mother - as long as the male image is not made to join her, as protector first and then as consort. The goddess herself also is subject to change. The terrible mothers may change their nature and change from devourers into protectors. But whatever her manifestations in anthropomorphic - zoomorphic shapes, her yantra remains the same, the Sri Cakra. Mrs. Jayakar sees the sacred female form represented by the clay images of the deathly figurines of the food cultivating communities of Zhob and Kulli; in the mystical sorceress identified as Yogan (Yogini) of the urban, Harappan civilization; in the abbreviated ver- sions of the female shapes of the chalcolithic culture of the Deccan, in contemporary hamlets throughout India. They are the holders of the secret of the earth; they also hold in one hand a cup of blood to fecun- date the earth; this may correspond to Visnu's blood that filled the skull-cup of Siva Bhairava. The cup is held by the young girl's bronze figurine from Mohenjo-daro wrongly considered by others as a dancer. There is not much left untold by Mrs.Jayakar of what she calls the ritual art of rural India. Her language is bold and fiery, her vision is comprehen- sive, her understanding goes to the roots. She writes from direct experience. Text and illustrations of the book complement one another. Though it is not necessarily always the most accomplished it is always a characteristic work of the respective tradition that is chosen. The dates assigned to some of the images are tentative. The sixteen chapters of the book form one organic whole like the petals of the astadala, the eight petalled lotus man- dala. "The Earthen Drum" substantiates the reviewer's earlier Unknown India, Ritual Art in Tribe and Village and exceeds its scope. It is an indispensable and stimulating guide for artists and scholars who will listen to The Earthen Drum. Philadelphia Museum of Art Stella Kramrisch IOl</page></plain_text>
