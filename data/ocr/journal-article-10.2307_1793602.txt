<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNDERWATER EXPLORATION Ten years ago there was a great need for popular, well illustrated books aimed at attracting the school- and university-leaver into oceanography, but today the band- waggon is well and truly launched?the stately royal barge floating down the Thames with its discreet orchestra playing Handel has been replaced by the floating jazz-band alive with jive and all things new. Now the time has come to be more selective; the broad panorama of oceanography has been established and the time is ripe for popular books which show the excitement of individual disciplines. The quartet of books under review illustrates this point. Seabrook Hull is a professional author, once editor of Undersea Technology and now of Ocean Science News and Geomarine Tech? nology. His concern in writing the bountiful sea (Sidgwick and Jackson, 1966, 355) has been to show the range of modern oceanography and this he does with an in- formation-packed text and scores of excellently reproduced photographs. But the</page><page sequence="2">reviews 399 magnitude of the task defeats him. He claims to 'cover the subject with the largess of the poet, the dedication of the scientist, the persistence of the engineer, the opti- mism of the inventor, the astuteness of the writer and the inquisitiveness of the honest man', while he has, in fact, fallen into the very same trap that he accuses others of occupying?making The bountifvd sea 'another "gee whiz" book'. Not so with the remaining three, whose authors restrict themselves to specialized topics of which they have intimate knowledge. George Bass is one of the new genera? tion of underwater archaeologists whose mature attitude to the excavation of ancient shipwrecks on the seabed is leading to rapid advances in this subject, which still labours under the false image of treasure seekers and wreck thieves. In Turkey, Bass has demonstrated that divers can excavate with the minute precision needed to effect an accurate reconstruction?and within the budget of any ambitious land excavation. His book archaeology under water {Thames and Hudson, 1966, 35s) provides an up-to-date assessment of this rapidly changing subject. For the sake of completeness befitting a contribution to Glyn Daniel's 'Ancient Peoples and Places' series, Bass includes the recovery of artifacts from rivers and sacrificial wells and refers briefly to the plotting of submerged coastal sites, but the real excitement in his narrative comes in wreck excavations off Turkey, where he is the acknowledged autho? rity. This is a fine, well illustrated book. Bass's work has taken him back in time to the Bronze Age and a ship 4000 years old, but in their book the deep and the past {Cape, 1966, 60s) David Ericson and Goesta Wollin describe their investigation of the whole Pleistocene Epoch and back into the Pliocene. This is one of the best, if not the very best, popular account of a scientific investigation that I have read. The authors describe their protracted search amongst deep ocean sediment cores to find a Pleistocene chronology. Eventually they achieve this by plotting the occurrence of tiny fossil shells of different, temperature- sensitive species, but the frustrations and depression of long periods of unproductive work, relieved only occasionally by some small advance are vividly described. They present a classic picture of pure research, with initially incoherent data becoming clear as one's model improves, with the core that was previously rejected providing the key to a significant advance once its message can be deciphered. Throughout their narrative, the authors retain the attention and, most important, the scientific confidence of the reader. They have a good story to teil, based on personal experience as shown by the many anecdotes, and they rarely go astray. (On p. 140, '. . . many cores must be studied and very little time was available; we were compelled to search for short cuts.' Surely the impatient scientist is continually seeking short cuts, but usually through personal rather than external pressure? Such over-dramatizations are happily rare). This book tells the intending recruit to oceanography more about the life he can expect than do a score of more comprehensive 'populars': it also pro? vides an object lesson for the intending science writer. Equally personal in treatment, though concerned with a completely different subject, is Robert Schroeder's something rich and strange {Allen and Unwin, 1967, 42s) in which he describes his observations of fish and other marine life whilst diving off Florida and the Virgin Islands. The writing is most readable, with a multitude of personal anecdotes linking the descriptions of courting rituals, cold- blooded predators and coral fish of ludicrous shape and colour. Having the confidence of a professional marine biologist, Schroeder is not afraid of a little anthropomorphism if it helps the story along. The author includes many practical hints for the fish watcher; particularly memorable is a device consisting of a stainless steel tube contain? ing a .375 magnum revolver cartridge and designed to deal with sharks: 'The test of the new gun came when a twelve-foot, thousand pound tiger shark carelessly swam alongside the skiff to present himself as a target. The bullet passed clean through his body, killing him instantly. When we dissected him we found blood clots in his musculature some distance from the wound and the liver and other organs were pulverized. Surveying the damage, a visiting ichthyologist whistled through his teeth: "Zowie! That's some bangstick!" The name stuck'. Compared</page><page sequence="3">400 reviews with the deep and the past, Schoeder's little book is like the modern jazz quartet after Beethoven: both are a long way ahead of Handel's music for the State barge.
