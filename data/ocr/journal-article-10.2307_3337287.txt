Text in English and French. 144 pp., 126 blw &amp; 14 color photos, 13 drawings, 1 map. Softcover. Reviewed by Anne Gaugue This book, published by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) as part of its Africom Programme, is the second in the series One Hundred Missing Objects, intended to fight the smuggling of cultural property. The first volume was devoted to artifacts taken from the site of Angkor; this one exposes the theft and looting of cultural property over the entire African continent. The publication of Looting in Africa is the result of "What Museums for Africa? Heritage for the Future," a series of gatherings of museum professionals held in 1991 in Ghana, Togo, and Benin. Not available for sale but widely distributed in museums, research centers, customs offices, and sales- rooms, this volume is meant to be a tool for professionals as well as a way of informing the public about this threat to Africa's heritage. The first part of the book includes two essays, by J. Devisse ("Heritage, Looting, Theft") and by M. Mukela and S. Tshiluila ("The Involvement of African Museum Pro- fessionals"), on the problems of theft and loot- ing on the continent. The second part contains listings by country of "Stolen Objects," "Looted Objects," and "Endangered Heritage." Mukela, director of the Nayuma Museum in Zambia, and Tshiluila, deputy director of the Institut des Mus6es Nationaux du Zaire, reflect on the guardian function of museum professionals. After reminding the reader of the role played by missionaries and colonial settlers in the destruction or exportation of wooden arti- facts, they stress how the illegal excavation of archaeological sites deprives historians of valuable information about the African past. The looting, carried out to satisfy the de- mand for such objects from Western coun- tries, is done with the collusion of African communities acting out of ignorance, cupid- ity, or poverty. Devisse, a distinguished professor of Afri- can history at the Universite Paris I, asserts that nowadays African borders are easy to cross and there is no repressive device to enforce the law. In order to remedy what he defines here as "cultural genocide," he suggests a series of quite standard protective measures: "individ- ual protection of the most important works, protection of display windows and museums themselves; inventory of collections with draw- ings, photography; agreements among states concerning border controls and more severe applications of existing legislation; interna- tional police collaboration" (p. 22). Mukela and Tshiluila recommend similar measures (p. 29), as do endorsers of the "Arusha Appeal" (p. 32), adopted in 1993 by participants in the workshop on the fight against the illicit art trade, organized by ICOM through their Africom Programme. Mukela and Tshiluila sum up the main projects of this programme: autonomy of museums, publica- tion of a list of museum professionals in Africa (first ed. December 1992), organization of regional workshops, and standardization of inventories. Educating the local people about the importance of field research will also aid the fight against illicit traffic, as in the example of Tegdaoust, Mauritania, cited by Devisse. Co- operation between the government and the local communities is important as well. Thus, Mukela and Tshiluila tell us that in Zambia, the National Heritage Conservation Com- mission grants financial loans to traditional leaders so they may maintain the cultural wealth of their community. Looting in Africa intends to be accessible to the widest range of readers, and this first sec- tion of the book clearly exposes the problems facing African governments and museum professionals. However, this desire to reach the many is no excuse for cliches and general- izing statements. Thus, I was surprised to read that "wherever oral sources were relied upon for information, the last two thousand years were barely covered" (p. 17)-which goes back too far. Missionaries and colonial officers are described as responsible for de- stroying wooden objects or exporting them to their motherlands. That characterization is accurate for the earlier Europeans, but one must take into account different stages in the colonial period. After World War II, numerous African museums, most of them research cen- ters as well, were founded by colonial admin- istrators to preserve pieces of African culture and history. Some items that had been sent to Europe in the nineteenth century were then shipped back to Africa. Thus, during an auction at Sotheby's in 1950, W. Fagg, then keeper of ethnography at the British Museum, bought for the colonial government of Nigeria a number of Benin pieces that were later exhibited at the Lagos Museum, which opened in 1957. According to Devisse, "Very little heritage during the colo- nial period ever existed in the legal sense, because the colonisers did not consider that Africa had any history..." (p. 18). Yet colonial governments passed laws to protect a her- itage which at that time was already consid- ered to be dying out. In 1937, for example, the colonial government of Tanganyika promul- gated a Monument Preservation Ordinance, and in French West Africa, three bills meant to protect and conserve the cultural heritage were passed in 1937, 1944, and 1956. The 1956 law was not repealed until 1985 in Mali and Burkina Faso, and 1987 in COte d'Ivoire. One may wonder about the choice of pho- tographs illustrating this first section. Devisse states that the sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List are far from representative of African history, and he draws the reader's attention to other types of heritage ("national, regional and urban"), less spectacular but just as filled with information. Yet, two-thirds of the photographs show sites on the World Heritage List: the great temple of Abou-Simbel, the church at Lalibela, the Great Zimbabwe National Monument, the Abomey Palace, the Ksar at A'it ben Haddou, and so on. A mistake slipped into the caption for the photograph of the royal palace at Abomey (p. 31). It is a pic- ture of bas-reliefs, not of the Assin's room. The French and English texts, printed side by side, do not always tally.

Phtcois o A alal Africa published by Unesco...aroused inter- est," whereas in the French version, this same General History has only met with "un assez timide dcho" (a rather feeble interest) (p. 22). Why do the "local communities" become "com- munautes traditionnelles" (p. 32)? This is not the place to dwell upon the use of the adjective "traditional," which to my mind is used far too often to describe African societies, but one must point out that a local community is not necessarily traditional. In the same sentence in the English text it is explained that the heritage belonging to those above-mentioned commu- nities "has been stolen or sold to unscrupulous traffickers," the word "or" implying the assent of the owners. In the French version this nuance disappears; there the heritage is described as "stolen and sold," and moreover at low prices-a piece of information missing from the English text (p. 32). Although these are merely details, one expects a more precise translation from an ICOM publication. The three chapters in the second part of this book describe the pieces stolen from pub- lic museums in Africa, then the objects looted in situ, and finally the endangered heritage. In the first chapter, nearly ninety items are listed, most of them stolen from museums in the cap- ital towns. Identifying information is given for each object: inventory number, the place and date of the theft, and the general charac- teristics of the piece (size, media, state of preservation, etc.). A photograph of the object, or if need be, a drawing, is also provided. As a tool for African-art professionals and customs or police officials, this list of stolen objects is interesting for two reasons. First, the descriptions of pieces are clear and precise; sec- ond, nearly half the thefts have taken place during the last five years, and nearly all after 1987. One may yet have doubts about the crite- ria ICOM used to choose the pieces to be men- tioned in this inventory, and especially about the overwhelming emphasis on North Africa and Nigeria. Over one-third of the listed thefts took place in five countries in the north-- Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Sudan-- and concern various types of objects, among them Greco-Roman sculptures, Byzantine and Phoenician pieces, Egyptian antiques, and Koranic manuscripts. Another third of the listed items were stolen in Nigeria, which, except for South Africa, boasts the largest number of museums in sub-Saharan Africa. About thirty of them are under the control of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments and are suffering more and more devastating thefts. The twenty-eight Nigerian items pictured in the book come from three museums, the Ile-Ife University Museum of Natural History and the national museums in Jos and Ile-Ife. Most are classical pieces of Nigerian art, examples of the marvelous civilizations of Nok, Igbo-Ukwu, Benin, and above all Ife. Nine of the twelve bronze and terracotta human heads stolen from the Ile-Ife national museum during the night of April 18-19, 1993, are illustrated. The fact that the theft of those pieces has been widely publicized is probably the best assurance that they will someday be returned. Therefore the ICOM publication makes an important contribution. One regrets, however, that the far more com- mon thefts of other types of Nigerian objects are not mentioned. The other African nations are underrepre- sented. Following a very classical vision of African art, most of the illustrated pieces are wooden objects: statuettes stolen from the Dundo (Angola), Abidjan, and Bangui muse- ums; masks from the Gaborone, Kinshasa, and Livingstone collections; reliquaries from the Brazzaville National Museum, and so forth. The second chapter of this section is devot- ed to looted material. Drawings and pho- tographs supplement the descriptions. For each of the twelve states mentioned, excerpts from the national legislation are quoted- proof, according to ICOM, of the "long-stand- ing importance placed by each African country on safeguarding its heritage" (p. 87). Though it was apparently necessary to show that those laws do exist, one can still deplore that the excerpts take up so much space. It would have been better to provide a wider range of looted objects than to print at length texts that can eas- ily be obtained from UNESCO. A variety of artifacts are grouped under the rubric "looted objects." Wooden masks and terracotta statuettes are mentioned together with fossilized wood and prehistoric 20 african arts * autumn 1995</page><page sequence="3">engravings. One would have expected to see various kinds of pieces removed through ille- gal archaeological excavation. But this chapter devotes very little space to buried artifacts. The description of the looted archaeological heritage is limited to the remains of early set- tlements (clay pottery and stone tools) in Botswana, the terracottas and sculpted stones of C6te d'Ivoire, and the terracottas from the Inland Niger Delta in Mali. As for North Afri- ca, mention is made only of the bas-reliefs from the ancient sites in Libya, and the lithic tools. Although we are told that museum pro- fessionals from Mozambique "are extremely concerned about illegal excavations and the looting of archaeological sites,...especially under-water sites" (p. 120), there are no texts or illustrations to provide information on the type of objects taken from these contexts. Most of the items depicted in this chapter were looted from village or family communi- ties: manuscripts from family libraries in Mauritania and Morocco, Gelede masks from the Republic of Benin, architectural elements (carved doors and door frames from Kenya, ceiling fragments or doors from communal garrets in Morocco), statuettes from Mada- gascar, regalia and musical instruments from Malawi. And yet the text tells us that today the living heritage is on the road to extinction (p. 35) and that the heritage most threatened is the one buried in the earth (p. 17). If that is the case, it would have been better to focus on the illicit traffic in excavated objects rather than on the goods stolen from villages. One may also question the decision to list objects according to country instead of cultural area, for that classification leads to redundancy. Thus, the Arabic manuscripts are quoted twice (for Morocco and Mauritania), as are the lithic tools (Libya and Mauritania). Presentation by cultural area would also have made it clear that Gelede masks are found not only in Benin but also in southern Nigeria, or that carved doors and furniture can be seen in Kenya as well as in Zanzibar and on the Tanzanian coast. In the examples presented, looting and theft are not the only reasons why objects have dis- appeared. In Malawi traditional weapons and implements for hunting and fishing have to be protected because "most of the people who knew how to make them have died" and they are "becoming obsolete due to the existence of modern equipment" (p. 104). This has nothing to do with looting. But The Last of the Mohicans haunts the observers of exotic societies, and the previous lines show a vision of African cultures as disappearing forever. As early as 1943, Theodore Monod, Director of IFAN (Institut Frangais d'Afrique Noire) and, as such, respon- sible for the museums in French West Africa, wrote that "I'Afrique africaine tout entiere est de fond en comble menacte, s'effrite sans cesse, et, c'est peu dire, s'dcroule par pans entiers comme une falaise sapde par le flot" (L'Hippopotame et le Philosophe, Paris, p. 121).

These few examples underline the shortcomings of the national legislations. The funerary steles in Mali and Burkina Faso are protected in the for- mer but not in the latter state, hence the need for regional agreements and cooperation be- tween bordering countries. No doubt this chap- ter, unlike the others, is intended to influence African governments or to make the public aware of the problem-it can in no way be used as a working tool for the custom officer or for the salesroom, since trade in the objects listed is not prohibited. On the contrary, we are here faced with valuable items that African-art deal- ers can still buy legally. At the end of the book there are texts deal- ing with the actions undertaken by UNESCO, ICOM, and Interpol in the fight against the illic- it traffic in cultural property. Two important innovations must be remembered, though. One is the text adopted by the United States gov- ernment in September 1993, which has made it illegal to import archaeological pieces from the Mali's Inland Niger Delta. The heritage of a few Latin America countries was already pro- tected by such legislation, but Mali is the first African country to profit from such laws. Second, important amendments to the 1970 UNESCO Convention (ratified by only sixteen African nations) are being studied. The most significant innovation of this project, written by UNIDROIT, is that from now on, buyers of cultural property will no longer be presumed to have acted in good faith, and will have to prove that they have been especially diligent in ensur- ing that their purchases were not stolen. Today, publicity is no doubt one of the best ways to fight illicit traffic and to recover stolen goods. Thanks to the first book in this series, a number of objects from Angkor have been iden- tified; one was returned to Cambodia within three months of publication. If Looting in Africa equally fosters the recovery of objects, then the aim of this book will have been reached. It is still too early to know. El</page></plain_text>
