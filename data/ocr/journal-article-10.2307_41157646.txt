<plain_text><page sequence="1">From History to Communal Narrative: The Merging of Cultural Paradigms in Their Eyes Were Watching God Jürgen С. Wolter ABSTRACT Zora Neale Hurston 's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God synthesizes two cultural princi- ples, the linearity of the literate tradition and the circularity of orality; it combines Western and African forms of constructing histories, ultimately privileging the African mode. The article ar- gues that Hurston employed this dualism on many levels, such as narrative technique, the im- agery of pulpit and porch, the treatment of time, the cavalcade of Janie's mentors/lovers, and the metaphors of mules/buzzards and dog/god. Hurston's novel synthesizes two principles of thinking and living, of recording (writ- ing) history and telling (performing) /г/stories: the Western literate tradition predi- cated on the principle of linearity, and the African oral tradition privileging circularity. Many critics agree with Robert Hemenway: "Janie's growth is Hurston's subject" (He- menway 240), and describe the linear progression of Their Eyes Were Watching God in terms of Janie's social or psychological development. They outline the change of her roles from Logan Killicks's "mule," to Joe Starks's shop assistant and showpiece, to Vergible "Tea Cake" Woods's romantic lover, or they focus on Janie's "quest for self- discovery and self-definition" (Kubitschek 110), her change "from a male-identified woman to a self firmly grounded in a positive sense of independent black woman- hood" (McKay 58), from a voiceless girl to a self-determined independent personality, from "a nameless child ... to the implied narrator of her own tale of self-conscious- ness" (Gates, "Their Eyes" 169). Others, however, emphasize the repetitiveness and rhythmic circularity of the novel by pointing out, for instance, the essential similarities of Janie's three marriages or by focusing on the novel's narrative frame and Janie's re- turn to Eaton ville.1 These critics see only one side of the coin, since the novel tells both a linear history in the Western tradition and a circular story in the African- American oral tradition; it merges two concepts of time, historical/diachronic time and circular/synchronic time. Unlike Toni Morrison's contrapuntal positioning of Sethe's narrative and school- teacher's text in Beloved, Their Eyes Were Watching God does not juxtapose these two cultural principles, but carefully synthesizes them. Through the overriding pattern of incremental repetition, Hurston in a way blends the linear quest pattern with the Afri- can-American circular form of call-and-response. 1 See, e.g., Howard, "Nanny and Janie," Pondrom, and Urgo.</page><page sequence="2">234 Jürgen C. Wolter I. History vs. Story The novel traces not only Janie Mae Crawford's development from a dependent child to an independent personality, and her successive relationships with four men, but also records the broader history of Janie's family from slavery times to the day when Janie turns this history into herstory. The story does not, as has been argued, "occur outside of a specific time and place" (Hubbard 168), or "in a seemingly ahistor- ical world" (Stepto 165), but, on the contrary, it contains many historical and geo- graphical references such as to specific campaigns of the Civil War and a devastating Florida hurricane.2 On the basis of internal evidence and these references, the history of Janie and her family can be reconstructed.3 However, Janie turns chronological/lin- ear history into an oral/circular story when she re-members4 her past to her friend Pheoby on the back porch of her house in Eatonville. Henry Louis Gates has com- mented on the opposition between the two "strategies of tale-telling" to be found in the novel: "Nanny narrates her slave narrative in a linear . . . manner, with one event following another in chronological order. Janie, by contrast, narrates her tale in a cir- cular, or framed, narrative" (Gates, "Their Eyes" 192). By inserting Nanny's linear slave narrative into Janie's circular story, Hurston highlights the difference between these modes of constructing hi/stories and the underlying contrast between cultural 2 When she stayed in the Bahamas in October 1929, Hurston survived "one of the worst hurri- canes" to hit that region. So she knew what she was writing about (see Hemenway 127). For de- tails of the legendary Florida hurricane of September 1928, see Lillios 89-90, and Hanna 261-62. 3 Since only Kaplan (122) has attempted to date the major events of the novel, it might be helpful to give a more detailed chronology of Janie's family history: Before the Civil War, Janie's grandmother lived on a "big plantation close to Savannah" (32), where she was forced into a sexual relationship with her master, the father of Leafy, Janie's mother. When Sherman took At- lanta on 1 September 1864, Nanny's master left the plantation to join the Confederate Army. Since her jealous mistress then threatened to have her whipped to death and her baby sold be- cause of her husband's infidelity, Nanny, with her week-old baby Leafy, escaped "to de swamp by de river" (35) a few days after Sherman's victory at Atlanta. On her flight, she was almost a wit- ness of Sherman's march on Savannah in December 1864 (35). She was taken in by a family in or near Savannah, where she still lived when "de Big Surrender at Richmond" (36) occurred (3 April 1865). After the end of the Civil War, Nanny went to West Florida (36), where she could send Leafy to a black school. At the age of seventeen (1881), Leafy was raped by her black schoolteacher and conceived a baby (Janie). After giving birth to Janie, Leafy disappeared. At the age of six (1887), Janie learned about the color of her skin (21) when she looked at a photo- graph. In spring 1897 (at the age of sixteen), Janie kissed Johnny Taylor (25f.), which so shocked her grandmother that only a "few days" (38) later Nanny married her off to Logan Killicks (1897). Since her husband, who was some decades older than Janie, treated her like a servant, she ran away with the energetic Joe Starks, who was "nearly thirty years" old ([48], spring 1898). After having borne his abuses for twenty years (1898-1918 [127], by which time she was "nearly forty" [122]), she publicly out-insulted and thus verbally destroyed Starks, who died shortly after- wards (1918). Although she loved the newly-won freedom of widowhood, Janie soon fell passion- ately in love with Tea Cake, with whom she moved to the Everglades. Their marriage lasted for a "year and a half" ([21], 1919 to 1921) and ended when Janie shot Tea Cake dead in self-defense. After her acquittal, Janie, about 40 years old, returned to Eatonville and told her story to Pheoby (1921). 4 1 am using here Toni Morrison's concept of "re-memory," which refers to the imaginative process of recollecting and constructing the past through narrative.</page><page sequence="3">From History to Communal Narrative 235 paradigms. Janie constructs the /zerstory of her life in a call-and-response situation with Pheoby, thus utilizing the "basic organizing principle of Black American culture generally, [which] enables traditional black folk to achieve the unified state of balance or harmony which is fundamental to the traditional African world view" (Smitherman 104). Stories that follow this principle meander from episode to episode and exasper- ate whites "who wish you'd be direct and hurry up and get to the point" (Smitherman 148). As a folklorist and cultural anthropologist, Hurston was very much aware of these cultural differences; she explicitly commented on the African American's prefer- ence for angularity "to avoid the simple straight line" and maintained that "the white man thinks in a written language and the Negro thinks in hieroglyphics" (Sanctified Church 54, 50). II. Pulpit vs. Porch The opposition of Nanny's and Janie 's strategies of telling about their lives is also reflected in another central contrast in the text- that between Nanny's ("white") pul- pit and Janie's (African-American) back porch. Janie's grandmother had always "wanted to preach a great sermon about colored women sitting on high," but had failed because "they wasn't no pulpit for me" (31-32). Nanny was bound to fail be- cause, as a black woman, she could never occupy the elevated seat of white male pre- rogative, and as a former slave her thinking could not transcend her experiences of a white, aristocratic society. Not only is the message of the text which Nanny saved for Janie informed by white culture, but also its form of deliverance, since "rarely will black preachers expound their message in the linear fashion of a lecture" (Smither- man 150). Hurston herself made the difference very clear: The real, singing Negro derides the Negro who adopts the white man's religious ways .... They say of that type of preacher, "Why he don't preach at all. He just lectures." And the way they say the word "lecture" makes it sound like horse-stealing. "Why, he sound like a white man preaching." (Sanctified Church 106-107) Nanny lectures; her narrative does not follow the African-American tradition of preaching and call-and-response, for she does not give Janie a chance to participate. Janie, however, preaches in the tradition of her race. After her journey as "a delegate to de big 'ssociation of life" (18) has come full cir- cle, Janie can fulfill Nanny's dream of passing on the wisdom of life, the "text," but now by means of African-American modes of expression. Her success is reflected in Pheoby's final words in the novel: "Ah done growed ten feet higher from jus' listenin' tuh you, Janie. Ah ain't satisfied wid mahself no mo'. Ah means tuh make Sam take me fishin' wid him after this" (284). Janie succeeded where Nanny failed because Janie changed Nanny's "white" metaphor (the pulpit as an elevated stage for an individual to preach down to a group) into the "black" metonymy (the porch as the center of black communal life and of a culture of call-and-response interaction). Nanny, "a product of slavery" (Howard 96), thought in the terms of a white patriarchal system as characterized by hierarchy and linearity- hence her eagerness that her granddaughter marry the socially respected Logan Killicks and sit "on uh high chair" and "on</page><page sequence="4">236 Jürgen C. Wolter porches lak de white madam" (172). In contrast, Janie, when telling the story of her life to Pheoby, does not sit elevated and exposed in a "high, ruling chair" (54) on the "front porch" (49), a position her class-conscious Nanny had wished for her and the "whitewashed" Starks had promised, but she and Pheoby sit "close together" (18) "on the steps of the back porch" (14, emphasis added). Starks's front porch had been "an extension of the store . . . and ... a gathering place for the town, mostly the men" (Dixon 91), and as such it stands for gender discrimination and Janie's confinement.5 Janie's decision against the front porch as the place for communicating her story is a decision against discriminating racial and sexual hierarchies, against what has been called "the male model" (Krasner 117). As William Ferris has shown in his study of the oral tradition in the Mississippi Delta, this is a model in which "women rarely par- ticipate in formal tale-telling sessions" and where males predominate "as the primary bearers of oral lore and within the tales themselves" (141). Janie's /lerstory is subver- sive in that she now occupies the center of the narrated as well as the narrative event. She destroys the dual authority of men in black folklore sessions, just as she (meta- phorically and even physically) destroys her three husbands. Janie could give her community a public how-to lesson in the American autobio- graphical tradition of Benjamin Franklin and other self-made men, but she prefers to tell the /lerstory of her life only to her best friend on the back porch. Thus she rejects Nanny's preaching and even Tea Cake's teaching (both primarily hierarchical forms of communication) in favor of the African-American form of reciprocal call-and-re- sponse, for "Pheoby's hungry listening helped Janie to tell her story" (23), and Janie asks Pheoby's help in her narrative: "... we been kissin'-friends for twenty years, so Ah depend on you for a good thought. And Ah'm talking to you from dat standpoint" (19). The development in the novel is not from silence to voice, as so many critics maintain,6 but from pulpit to back porch, i.e., from the hierarchical/linear thinking and recording of hisioxy to the communal/circular re-membering of /zerstory or even their- story.7 It is essentially the change from a white/male voice to a black/female voice.8 5 For Dianne Sadoff, "the porch tales reveal the men's insistence on female submission and in- feriority, while they enhance masculine pride and encourage male solidarity" (16). 6 We should note that very early on, indeed, Janie speaks her mind and protests against Nanny's plan to marry her to Killicks, and that it is only six months after the hated wedding that she takes her stand: "If you can stand not to chop and tote wood Ah reckon you can stand not to git no dinner" (45). The violent dispute at the end of her first marriage, at the age of seven- teen, shows that Janie has not been voiceless altogether. She knows well how to use her tongue, "the only real weapon left to weak folks. The only killing tool they are allowed to use in the presence of white folks" (275). She demonstrates this again right after her arrival in Eatonville, when she resists Amos Hicks's sexist condescension (61). In the first years of her marriage to Starks, "she fought back with her tongue as best she could, but it didn't do her any good" (111), so she "adopts silence as a survival strategy" (Kitch 72). She is certainly not the passive, sup- pressed and helpless victim, as is testified by the way she attracted Joe Starks. See also Kaplan: "Janie never does acquire a voice . . . , but had one ... all along" (118). Similarly, Lowe regards Janie's silence as "a mask she will wear for years" (168). 7 Benesch similarly sees a "merging of literary and oral style in the novel; however, he focuses on Janie's development toward a "participation in black folk traditions" (634), not toward a final abandonment of one culture in favor of another. 8 It is important that Janie explicitly refuses to tell her story to the front porch storytellers of Eatonville, despite Pheoby's advice to "make haste and tell 'em 'bout you and Tea Cake gittin'</page><page sequence="5">From History to Communal Narrative 237 This change may also account for the shifts in the narrative perspective, for it is no longer Janie who tells her own story. Some events Janie could not have witnessed and could therefore not narrate, include Nanny's history of racial and sexual abuse, the porch-sitters' "lies" (i.e., tall-tales) about the mule, the funeral of the dead mule, and the buzzard allegory. Furthermore, Pheoby had been Janie 's best friend during her twenty years in Eatonville; so there would be no real need to repeat most of their common experiences during that period. All this would suggest that Janie is not the central narrator of the novel, but that the narrative is rather a communal re-member- ing of the stories about one of Eatonville's most glamorous and controversial charac- ters, if not even prophet and potential savior/emancipator. 9 Janie Crawford is "a fe- male Christ-figure" (McAninch-Rünzi 140), her initials are JC, she returns to her Jeru- salem in the full knowledge that she will not be welcome and that she will have to die, and shortly before her death she delivers her sermon to her disciple Pheoby during a last supper, rejecting the pharisaic crowd of whom Pheoby rightly remarks: "An envi- ous heart makes a treacherous ear" (16). However, Janie's is not a sermon on the mount, "sittin' on high," but a sermon on the steps of the back porch, to which one does not come "by the front gate and down the palm walk," but through the "inti- mate gate" (14). Thus, calling the novel "the bible of black women's liberation" (Jor- dan 115)10 is justified even as far as the narrative voice is concerned. Their Eyes Were Watching God is the textual concretization of "Janie's apotheosis in Eatonville's oral culture" (Kuyk 57); it could be read as Janie Crawford's /lerstory constructed by black women through communal re-membering. The polyphonic narrative blends Nanny's linear lecture to Janie with Janie's call-and-response sermon to Pheoby as it was "saved" by Pheoby, the Eatonville community, and, finally, Hurston. In this way the novel underscores the point of many ethnic literatures that people are the repositories of histories, a point which was at the center of Hurston's anthropological fieldwork. married" (17). Had she done so, she would only have assumed Joe Starks's position within the class-oriented and hierarchical paradigm he had represented in "his" town. Janie does not want to tell her story as Starks (or Nanny) would have told it, preaching from a pulpit or a "high, rul- ing chair" on the front porch; rather, she wants it told in a communal spirit, where the social po- sition of the narrator is unimportant. Therefore, she does not object to her story being told to the community by Pheoby, because Janie now thinks in communal terms, even if the porch-sitters will not accept her. Given the tension between her and the porch-sitters on her return, it would have been impossible to tell her story to them in a communal spirit. Of course, Janie could have waited until she was accepted in the community again and could then have told her story herself to the community, but she is probably aware that she is dying of rabies, which she contracted from Tea Cake's bite on her arm, and so needs a mediator to preserve her story. A convincing ar- gumentation for Janie's suffering from rabies is offered by Carr and Crouther, and by Hatten- hauer. 9 The communal voice as a narrative strategy should not be confused with the voice of the Ea- tonville community at the beginning of the novel, when people, still full of "envy" and in a kind of "mass cruelty," "made burning statements with questions, and killing tools out of laughs" (10). Carby stresses the "antagonistic relation" (82) between Janie and the community. 1U For a close biblical reading of the novel, see McAninch-Rünzi 105-47, and Mayne 21-65.</page><page sequence="6">238 Jürgen C. Wolter III. The Road of History vs. the Meadow of Memory The novel's narrative voice reconstructs the chronological linearity of Janie's history in a further way by a very subjective rendering of the match between narrated time and narrative time. Her twenty-year marriage to Joe Starks, for instance, is told in less than 90 pages (47-135), whereas her 18 months with Tea Cake are given almost 140 pages (144-281). And at the end of chapter 6, Janie is 24, but at the beginning of the next chapter she is 35 years old. In part, of course, this selectivity is due to the human system of memory as episodic re-collection. Furthermore, James Krasner argues that the selective reconstruction of the novel's historical chronology is a result of Janie's persuasive strategy: "Janie . . . needs to convince both Eatonville and herself that her prophecy [that Tea Cake was the realization of her pear tree vision] has been ful- filled" (123). However, the distortion could also be explained by different concepts of time, a difference which Arna Bontemps expresses in a graphic image: "Time is not a river. Time is a pendulum" (vii). I would argue that this difference underlies the narra- tive structure of the novel. The text presents time not as a river or, to use William Faulkner's imagery, a "diminishing road," but as "a huge meadow" ("Rose" 129). The narrative may superficially follow the "river," the "diminishing road," i.e., the line of history, starting with the more distant past of Janie's grandmother and then focusing on Janie's three marriages in chronological order, but at the same time it takes a walk on the meadow of Janie's past. On this walk, the narrative voice leaves out long peri- ods of time, reminding the reader of the text's statements: ". . . women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to for- get" (9), and "[i]t was all according to the way you see things" (138). The narrative voice is not at all interested in a straight plot, but rather in re-collecting and re-mem- bering those episodes which it finds meaningful. Despite the chronological progression of the narrated events, the narrative constantly turns back upon itself, since basically the re-membered episodes, i.e., the major steps in Janie's life, were not too different, for Janie repeatedly found herself in similar places or situations. The difference behind the two concepts of time also has implications for Tea Cake and Janie's "immortality." "Tea Cake . . . could never be dead until she herself had fin- ished feeling and thinking" (286, emphasis added). Tea Cake is immortal as long as Janie lives; Janie is immortal as long as the /lerstory of her life is re-membered by the communal voice. Hurston here emphasizes the engendering of male history through the collective /zerstory in a culture based on communal principles, where "the past is never dead. It's not even past" (Faulkner, Requiem 535). The past is re-membered and preserved, is alive in the circular and oral narratives on the porch. In contrast, on the diminishing road of the linear concept of time the past is the spot that we have passed once and for all. The difference is between the "perspective of oral history," which is "from the present to the past," and that of "written history," which is "from the past to the present" (Galli and Harrison 172). According to the chronology of the novel, Tea Cake (and probably Janie) died in 1921, but for a mind thinking in oral terms, they will not die as long as they are alive in the re-memory of the community and its narratives.</page><page sequence="7">From History to Communal Narrative 239 IV. Janie's Men: Out of the Frying Pan, into the Fire The dualism of history (linear/Western) and story (circular/ African- American) can also be found in the narrative about Janie's four relationships with men, who come from different social classes and, at first sight, represent a progressive linear pattern of rise and fall, but ultimately establish a repetitive and circular pattern: Soon after her growth to sexual maturity, Janie has her first passionate encounter with Johnny Taylor. The lovers are disturbed when Nanny sees Johnny "lacerating her Janie with a kiss" (25). Though this romance is very short-lived, it sets a pattern for the other relationships in that it raises the question of who or what controls Janie's life. Her marriage to Logan Killicks sparks off her social and economic rise; however, her husband's chauvinism and abuse turns the marital bond into bondage. When Janie leaves Killicks for Joe Starks, she "trades a physical prison for an emotional one" (Racine 285). Her marriage to this black middle-class representative of white capital- ism is certainly a further rise on the social ladder. For those readers who remember Hurston's commentary on the "stark, trimmed phrases of the Occident" (Sanctified Church 53), Starks 's name alone relates him to the paradigm of Western thinking. He occupies the key positions in Eatonville, adopts the role of God ("I god" is his favor- ite expletive), and introduces a white hierarchical order in the world he creates around himself. His insistence on Janie's submission is not so much informed by male chauvinism (as was the case with Killicks) as by the class-conscious elitism he has adopted, along with his capitalist ambition, from his former white employers in a bank in Atlanta; for instance, he silences and objectifies Janie not only because she is a woman, but also, and primarily, because as the mayor's wife she should be special: "... he didn't mean for nobody else's wife to rank with her" (66). From his White House he controls the community (and his wife) like a slave owner. Janie's relationship with Tea Cake, who is twelve years her junior, seems to be an- other giant step for her because of his identification with his own class and race. He is the first of her husbands and mentors not to "rely on external manifestations of power, money, and position" and to be relatively "immune to the influence of white American society" (Wall 388). Since as a migrant laborer he owns nothing of great material value, Tea Cake actually represents a complete reversal of Janie's spectacular social rise, a drastic shift of values in her life. Also in contrast to her previous hus- bands, Tea Cake teaches her to hunt and play checkers and asks her to work with rather than for him. However, this relationship does not really bring about the final step toward independence for Janie. Jennifer Jordan concludes that even with Tea Cake Janie "never learns to shape her destiny by making her own choices" (111); she rather follows him blindly, always accepting his (mostly wrong) decisions. Because of his destructive nature he is certainly not a wholly positive alternative to Killicks and Starks. Like her previous husbands, he treats her quite condescendingly: "You needs tellin' and showin', and dat's whut Ah'm doin'" (162). When during the hurricane she suggests, "Maybe it's better tuh stay heah," Tea Cake stuns "the argument with half a word" because he "had seen more than Janie had" (237). Had he for a minute checked his male arrogance, they would have been saved just as Motor Boat was saved by staying put. For Lloyd Brown, Tea Cake is "as brutally possessive and insen- sitive as Killicks and Starks had been" (44), and for Michael Awkward he is just an</page><page sequence="8">240 Jürgen C Wolter "unabashed" sexist and "a traditionally domineering male" (83). As mentor and pro- tector he is the ultimate failure in the novel. For while Nanny, Killicks, and Starks were increasingly successful providers for Janie, Tea Cake risks Janie's and his own life when he refuses good advice from several people such as Motor Boat and Janie her- self and ignores a number of clear warnings. He fails to an even greater extent than Starks, because he "places himself above God and nature" (hooks 13). Although Janie's three husbands represent different economic modes of black life, and although the roles Janie has to assume with each husband seem to change from servant to wife to passionate lover, the men's treatment of Janie is not so different as the narrative voice wants us to believe. Just compare the places that are assigned her by her three husbands. Killicks: "You ain't got no particular place. It's wherever Ah need yuh" (52); Starks: ". . . uh woman and her place is in de home" (69); Tea Cake: "Janie is wherever Ah wants tuh be" (219). Joseph Urgo warns: The mistake easily made in reading the novel as a progression from bad to mediocre to best mate for Janie is to miss the repetition of treatment Janie receives from each man. Each man seeks domination, each man seeks possession. Each man physically assaults her. (52) Thus, even as regards the major male characters the novel presents the dualism of linearity (rise and fall) and circularity (repetitiveness). The history of Janie's life sug- gests a development in these relationships, the narrative of Janie's herstory, however, discloses a fundamental similarity between them. Progress turns out to be a vicious circle. V. Tea Cake: Closing the Circles The similarities between Janie's three husbands constitute a rhythmic, even formu- laic narrative structure reminiscent of trebling in folklore. In addition, other similari- ties also constitute a circular pattern undercutting Janie's rise from a backyard shack to Eatonville's White House and the freedom of a rich widow: In Janie's relationship with Tea Cake there are references to Nanny which close the circle of Janie's mentors: When her hopes for a better future for her granddaughter are shattered by Janie's embrace with Johnny Taylor, Nanny's "head and face looked like the standing roots of some old tree that had been torn away by storm" (26). Similarly, Janie's hopes that Tea Cake "could be a bee to ... a pear tree blossom in the spring" (161) are torn away by the hurricane. Nanny had dreamed that she could help Janie "take a stand on high ground" (32). This dream of the aspiring African American turns into a fatal nightmare during the hurricane when Janie learns that the high ground has already been occupied by whites. Another parallel between Nanny and Tea Cake be- comes obvious when one takes into consideration that Janie might die of rabies: Nanny's way of thinking constricted Janie's horizon "and pinched it in to such a little bit of a thing that she could tie it about her granddaughter's neck tight enough to choke her" (138). What Nanny did metaphorically and psychologically, Tea Cake, by infecting Janie with rabies, does literally and physically, because Janie, too, will probably feel the symptoms of the illness which Tea Cake describes as something "grabbing] at his</page><page sequence="9">From History to Communal Narrative 241 throat with iron fingers" (264). When she finally sits down on the steps of the back porch, Janie is the rich widow in overalls, i.e., just what she would have been had she stayed with Logan Killicks, Nanny's choice for her. Thus, finally and ironically, Nanny's dream for Janie, a dream of protection through a house and money in the bank, has come true, but Janie refuses to sit on high; she prefers community to hierarchy. It has been argued that Tea Cake is "an adult version of the adolescent Johnny Tay- lor" (Dixon 89),11 which would close the circle of Janie's lovers. Both are regarded by others as shiftless and irresponsible. Furthermore, Janie's relationships with Taylor and Tea Cake are passionate, and their stories abound with metaphors from nature. In contrast, the marriages with Killicks and Starks are unhappy, burdensome and re- stricted; the dominant metaphors there are those of confinement and division. In this way, the circles of mentors, lovers, and husbands close with Tea Cake and with Janie's return. She had left Eatonville in an almost royal "blue satin dress" (10) and came back in blue overalls (which Killicks had originally demanded her to don). For the Eatonville porch-sitters (thinking in linear/hierarchical terms), Janie's return is not a 'comeback'; rather it represents her social fall after her spectacular and much envied rise and is the peripeteia of Janie's history; for the narrative voice, however, which de- constructs these hierarchies and re-constructs the tale as a circular, oral narrative, the return to Eatonville is the fulfillment of Janie's life, the climax of Janie's herstory. The cultural and narrative principles of linearity and circularity meet in the episodic pattern of incremental repetition. The stories about Janie's three marriages are incre- mental in that the narrative time devoted to each of them gets longer, which, in the cases of Starks and Tea Cake, misrepresents the actual duration of the narrated events. Even more incremental, however, are the acts of violent self-defense with which Janie concludes all three marriages. In a loud altercation about her role in the marriage, she destroys Killicks's hopes and dreams; his emotional collapse is reflected in the fact that his "last sentence was half a sob and half a cry" (53). She metaphorically kills Starks with a more aggressive verbal onslaught on "his illusion of irresistible maleness" (123). And finally, she literally kills Tea Cake with three (!) gunshots. Thus each marriage cul- minates in a definite and violent climax. This suggests that Tea Cake's death is not only motivated morally by his abusive treatment of Janie, as Alice Walker (Search 305) be- lieves, but also by the novel's narrative strategy of incremental repetition. VI. Mules and Buzzards, Dogs and Gods The strategy of deconstructing the linear paradigm by superimposing a circular or repetitive structure is also applied to the central imagery of the novel. The final crises of all three marriages are expressed by anthropomorphic images or literally caused by an animal. These include the mule, representing all underprivileged beings as concerns class, race, and gender,12 and also the carrion buzzards and the mad dog. 11 See also Hattenhauer 51, 54. 12 For an analysis of "the parallels between the mule, the slave, and the silenced woman," see Haurykiewicz 56.</page><page sequence="10">242 Jürgen C Wolter When Killicks plans to buy another mule so "gentled up ... even uh woman kin handle 'im" (46), the structure of the marriage starts to resemble the hierarchy of a slave-holding society; Nanny had explained this earlier: "... de white man throw down de load and tell de nigger man tuh pick it up. He pick it up because he have to, but he don't tote it. He hand it to his womenfolks. De nigger woman is de mule uh de world" (29). Thus, the crisis of this marriage occurs when Killicks plans to "enslave" Janie by making her his mule. In the episodes from her marriage with Joe Starks, Matt Bonner's mule is used by the narrative voice to highlight Janie 's oppression, her mul/iebrity.13 At the mock funeral of the mule, which Joe forbids Janie to attend because of its "mess uh commonness" (94), first Joe, then Sam stand "on the distended belly of the mule for a platform," their speeches mocking "everything human in death" (95). The symbolism of this scene is ex- plained by the ensuing allegory about the carrion buzzards and their social hierarchy: observing decorum, the flock waits for the "w/i/te-headed leader" (96, emphasis added) to examine the carcass, leap upon it, and ceremonially open the feast. Beyond the obvi- ous similarities, the differences between the two ritual ceremonies are significant: While Starks used the mule's carcass as a "platform" (reminiscent of Nanny's pulpit) to de- liver a speech which "made him more solid than building the schoolhouse had done" (95), the buzzard leader starts a ritual of call-and-response. By signifying on the pre- vious episode in a carnivalesque fashion,14 this scene mocks not only Starks's class-con- sciousness and his insistence that Janie observe the rules of propriety, but any kind of hierarchy at all. Since Janie was not present at the funeral, the narrative voice of these episodes about death and about the buzzards as black "culture heroes" (Hurston, Sanc- tified Church 57) must be the communal voice of Eatonville. Its narrative strategy of first repeating the metaphors used in the episode about Killicks, and then juxtaposing two symbolically referential scenes ironically debunks Starks's "white" code of social hierarchy and thus reflects Eatonville 's attitude toward him: "... any man who walks in the way of power and property is bound to meet hate" (77). The deconstructive momentum of the incremental repetition of metaphors and im- ages is even more evident in the striking resemblance between the funeral episode and the climactic scene during the flood, when the rabid dog stands on top of the cow. Not only does the image of the mad dog signify on the would-be god Starks, the re- semblance also refers to the hierarchical structure of the world in which these compa- rable events occur: in both cases the elevated being (god, dog) relies for his/its posi- 13 There are several similarities between Bonner's yellow mule and the light-skinned Janie. For instance, Bonner "rode dat mule all de way from West Floridy down heah" (88); Joe also brought Janie to Eatonville from West Florida, where she had been raised by Nanny and lived with Killicks for a year. Furthermore, Joe forbids her to indulge in "mule talk" (85), ostracizing her just as the mule is ostracized as the laughingstock of the "mule-talkers" (81). When Janie sympathizes with the maltreated animal, Starks buys the mule and so demonstrates his benevo- lent leadership and superiority as the great emancipator; in a similar way he had "bought" Janie with sweet-talk and visions of greatness in the scrub oaks (not beneath a pear tree, though) and emancipated her from the slave-like drudgery in Killicks's house. In Starks's eyes, Janie has never been more than a domesticated animal: "Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows," he maintains (110). 14 On this scene as carnivalesque, see also Levecq 101-102.</page><page sequence="11">From History to Communal Narrative 243 tion on the support of those who suffer (mule, cow). Thus the self-proclaimed god Starks and the mad dog are connected; the entire idea of human self-aggrandizement and social stratification in general is sarcastically parodied, and the parody is height- ened by the signifying allegory of the carrion buzzards.15 Only in the ultimate crises of their lives do people like Tea Cake and Janie see the futility of status among humans, do they recognize that the "time was past for asking the white folks what to look for through that door." Only now do they turn their eyes: "Six eyes were questioning God" (235). The dog may be God's answer to those who have always thought in hierarchical terms and raised their biased eyes to false gods and idols.16 Through raging nature (the hurricane and the flood as personified by the mad dog) He blows away and drowns hegemonic aspirations in terms of class, race, and gender and baptizes Janie, who had made Tea Cake her idol,17 into a new life of independence. Right after the dog is killed, the storm subsides; nature, as God's vehi- cle, has served its purpose. For the further course of Janie 's life the hurricane could be read as an almost biblical symbol of destruction and creation; it could blow away all social aspirations and gender-defined dependencies. The flood could be the leveling deluge prior to her regeneration as an independent woman. When Janie summarizes the experience of her life as "They got tuh go tuh God, and they got tuh find out about livin' fuh theyselves" (285), she stresses the importance not only of personal knowledge of the world but also of dethroning all the false gods, the boss men of any kind whom Nanny and Janie 's husbands had worshiped. There - 15 Baker reads the image of "the mad (male) dog atop the back of a terrified female cow" as a "sign of the type of relationships sanctioned" by "a viciously segregated world" (59). Similarly DuPlessis: "A rabid dog sitting on a burdened, bewildered beast seems to be Hurston's deep al- legorical comment on the system of race-inflected social stratification" (115). 16 The novel in general shows that false gods, i.e., wrong idols and dreams, develop into mad dogs, i.e., life-threatening nightmares. The first example, of course, is Killicks (idolized by Nanny), whose promise of protection turns into the nightmarish experience of connubial slavery. Simi- larly, Joe Starks's promise of a "far horizon" (50) degenerates into the nightmare of extreme confinement where women are treated just like "chillun and chickens and cows" (110). But the best example, of course, is Tea Cake, who at the beginning of their marriage is seen by Janie as "a glance from God" (161), as the potential fulfillment of her dreams, but then through his seri- ous flaws turns rather into a glance into hell: when Tea Cake contracts rabies, "[t]he glance of God becomes the ferocious look of a mad dog" (Krasner 124), who destroys not only himself, but Janie, too. When the eyes of the stormbound group are "watching God" (236), they seek di- rection and assistance from "above," from a higher, detached power, just as Nanny, Killicks and Starks had adopted the values and maxims of their lives from the dominant white culture, and just as Janie had always relied on others for the fulfillment of her dreams. Even Tea Cake had, in the decisive crisis, followed the wrong gods of materialism and racism ("You couldn't have a hurricane when you're making seven and eight dollars a day picking beans. Indians are dumb anyhow, always were. . . . 'Else dey'd own dis country still'" [229-31]), and he had relied on whites ("De white folks ain't gone nowhere. Dey oughta know if it's dangerous" [231]). Tea Cake here represents the African-American community of Belle Glade, who in times of crisis do not find all hierarchies leveled, but fall back on hierarchical thinking and worship the 'divine' power of status and money: "The folks let the people do the thinking. If the castles felt themselves secure, the cabins needn't worry" (234). In the ultimate crisis of their lives, their thinking turns out to be as hierarchical as that of the whites, who aggressively impose their system again when they oc- cupy the high ground of the bridge and segregate the graves after the storm. u For Tea Cake as Janie s idol, see Mayne 48-55.</page><page sequence="12">244 Jürgen C. Wolter fore, Janie's advice to Pheoby advocates a search for the genuine God, who turns out to be the communal spirit of African- American culture, personified by the communal voice of the narrative. The narrative strategy of the novel is the textual concretization of this newly found communal spirit; the individual narrator of a (linear/historical) autobiography is replaced not by another authorial/authoritative storyteller persona, but by the collaborative and collective narrator of an oral culture. If the novel traces "Janie's search for a definition of God" (Chinn 92), it leads her to a rejection of all self-proclaimed fake "gods" from Nanny to Tea Cake18 and ends with her finding a new and different authority in the shared voice of African- American communal cul- ture rather than in an individual voice. For she had raised her individual voice even during her first marriage, and it had broken her first husband and killed her second. The porch-sitters in Eatonville had confirmed: "Yo' wife is uh born orator, Starks" (92). However, the novel does not present Janie as an orator. Rather it rejects all lin- ear and hierarchical modes of narrative, for it does not foreground the individual voice of an autobiographical slave narrative (such as Nanny told to Janie); nor does it present Janie as preaching down from a porch or pulpit (as Nanny had envisioned for herself and Janie) or as holding speeches for self-aggrandizement (as she might have learned from dog/god-like Joe Starks on top of the mule); instead, the novel privileges the buzzards' oratory, the communal/collective reconstruction of stories. VII. Conclusion Since Hurston is more interested in representing "black culture in the art of fic- tional narrative rather than primarily in sociological or political terms" (Gates and Lemke xi), her text does not make the different paradigms of Western and African- American culture clash in a racial conflict. This provoked harsh criticism of the novel from her black contemporaries, first and foremost Richard Wright, who would prob- ably have preferred a story in the form of Nanny's personal slave history. As a matter of fact, whites only occur on the fringes of the narrative and mostly as Janie's benefac- tors (for instance, the Washburns and the white court). Rather, Hurston shows us to what great extent Western/linear/hierarchical thinking has been adopted by African Americans and with what fatal consequences. Since Janie recognizes this, she decides to resolve the dichotomy of this "double consciousness" by bending the line of pro- gression, which could have led her to yet another man and place, into a circle of repe- tition. She returns to the "whitest" place of oppression she has known, the "White House" of Eatonville, but now she sits down on the back porch with her best friend Pheoby, not on the front porch with "Mouth-Almighty" (16). When she first came to Eatonville, she had been regarded merely as an asset of Starks's (Tom Taylor had wel- comed him: "Brother Starks, we welcomes you and all dat you have seen fit tuh bring amongst us- yo' belov-ed wife, yo' store, yo' land" [67]). On this second coming, she returns alone from "de big convention of livin'" and "could . . . tell 'em things" (18), if they were willing to meet her without prejudice. Since they are not prepared to accept 18 For an analysis of Janie's three husbands as godlike figures, see Sheppard.</page><page sequence="13">From History to Communal Narrative 245 her as an independent personality, she prefers a relationship (with Pheoby) that is "nonhegemonic and reversible" (Hite 269). In order to understand the narrative strategy of the novel and its commentary on cul- tural paradigms, one should finally consider other possible ways of telling Janie's story: It would have been more logical had Hurston given Janie the chance (and the voice) to tell her story to people who do not know anything about her, for instance to the jury in the courthouse (twelve white men sat on her case and "none of them knew" anything about her and Tea Cake [275]), or to new neighbors in yet another community where she could have moved from Belle Glade. For these audiences, a detailed account of her story would have been naturally motivated: "She had to go way back to let them [the jury] know how she and Tea Cake had been with one another . . ." (278). In these cases, Janie would have been the narrator of her own herstory. But obviously Hurston was not interested in such a linear history given by an individual narrator; therefore she gives just one sentence in Janie's defense during the trial: "She just sat there and told and when she was through she hushed" (278). Instead, Hurston has Janie return to the place where she had lived for twenty years, where everybody knew about her, and has her tell her story to her best friend. Evidently Hurston's purpose was not to provide informa- tion about Janie's history (this could have been done best by an autobiography), but to present the possibilities of a non-linear, circular narrative performed by a communal, not an individual, voice. Hurston was probably not even interested in giving Janie a nar- rative voice of her own, since Janie does not present a single one of the "big stories" (200) she learned to tell while on the muck. With a protagonist who entrusts the narra- tive center of her story to a black communal voice, the novel is in striking contrast to the narrative mode of other African- American writings, especially to the as-told-to pat- tern of the genuinely African- American slave narrative.19 Hence, the narrative strategy of the novel combines the principles of (Western) his- tory (linearity/chronology) and (African) orality (repetition/circularity), just as Janie's physiognomy combines black and white features.20 The novel thus outlines Janie's ac- ceptance of her blackness (her realization of the value of the back porch) and her re- jection of what is white in herself (the abandonment of her aspirations for a place on the front porch). This process started when at the age of six she did not recognize her- self as the black girl on the photo and Miss Nellie asked her: "Dat's you, Alphabet, don't you know yo' ownself" (21). At that time, and for over twenty more years, she really did not know her own black self but thought, like Nanny and especially Joe Starks, in white terms. This change in thinking, and in telling others about one's self is emphasized by the fact that only this episode at the Washburns is told by Janie in the first-person, autobiographical voice; after the discovery of her racial Otherness the narrative shifts to the communal voice.21 Nevertheless, Janie has a long way to go until she can rid herself of the influence of her class-conscious mentors and oppressors 19 For the novel as a revision of the slave narrative, see McKay 66-67. 20 Ashe shows that "Hurston gives her central character ... all of the attributes of the white- female standard of beauty" (580). 21 Similarly, Gates sees the novel's "free indirect discourse" as both an expression of Janie's "divided self" and a representation of "the collective black community's speech and thoughts" ("Their Eyes" 192, 199).</page><page sequence="14">246 Jürgen C. Wolter Nanny, Killicks, and Starks, the representatives of the white codes of individual success and social hierarchy. The clearly progressive plot of the novel is much more than "merely one of Hur- ston's devices to achieve thematic unity" (Gates, "Their Eyes" 169); it reflects the dominant culture's way of thinking, which is here constantly and subversively under- cut by the repetitive and circular principle of an oral culture, just as the false gods of a hierarchical social structure are dethroned by the divinity of communal exchange. The novel brings together the narrative conventions of oral and literate cultures, but privi- leges the circular pattern over and above the linear pattern. This constitutes the novel's actual subversiveness, its "undermining of hierarchy" (Davie 448). Works Cited Ashe, Bertram D.
