<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAWKS, SERPENTS, AND BIRD-MEN: EMERGENCE OF THE ONEOTA MODE OF PRODUCTION by David W. Benn ABSTRACT The late prehistoric Oneota society of the midwestern United States is analyzed for its politico economic structure. Oneota cultural organization is compared with Mississippian chiefdoms to the south for evidence of complexity. This approach does not extend the critique to a deep enough level, and the methods of dialectical materialism are introduced to analyze how value was created from social labor in the Oneota system. Oneota society is modeled as a tribal organization in which specific forms of so cial structures existed to justify production and differential distribution of a social-surplus. The organiza tion of the Oneota production system engendered it to expand; therefore, the model is expanded to explain how symbolic motifs (hawks) developed as a standard of cultural hegemony for the Oneota. The trans formation from Woodland to Oneota systems is analyzed as an historical process involving the reor ganization of productive relations and the development of pan-ethnic symbols of dominance. [T]he world of humankind constitutes a manifold, a totality of interconnected proces ses, and inquiries that disassemble this totality into bits and then fail to reassemble it falsify reality. Concepts like "nation," "society," and "culture" name bits and threaten to turn names into things. Only by understanding these names as bundles of relationships, and by placing them back into the field from which they were abstracted, can we hope to avoid misleading in ferences and increase our share of under standing (Wolf 1982:3). Oneota culture (A.D. 900-1650) has been the subject of much attention in Iowa (e.g., Keyes 1927; Wedel 1959; Henning 1961, 1970; Straffin 1971; Glenn 1974; Gradwohl 1967, 1974:95; Harvey 1979; Osborn 1982) and else where in the Midwest (e.g., Griffin 1937; Hall 1962; Gibbon 1966,1969,1970,1983). The rapid, widespread florescence of Oneota culture (Fig. 1) and its sharp contrast with preceding Wood land cultures have made this culture an enigma in terms of culture process. Since the time of Mildred Mott Wedel's (1959) analysis of the Orr manifestation, researchers have tended toward a consensus of what traits are typical of Oneota?shell tempered pottery, triangular arrow points, small end scrapers, large villages with storage pits, trade materials such as cat linite and copper and cemeteries with extended burials. The taxonomic classification (Willey and Phillips 1958; Harvey 1979:231) and socio political analysis (Gibbon 1982) of the Oneota system remain areas of controversy. COMPLEXITY A case has been made for an increase in so cial complexity (i.e., increased societal size, scale and organization; Price and Brown 1985:8) and economic intensification in the eastern United States six millennia before the time of the 233</page><page sequence="2">David W.

Brown (1985) and Cohen (1985:104) reason that social packing caused hunters and gatherers to "broaden niches" by in troducing technical and organizational changes like permanent structures, storage facilities, elaborated technology and new foods. These changes indicate a gradual trend toward seden tism and circumscribed territories. The inten sification process continued through the Late Woodland period, when there was widespread evidence for localized exploitation of labor-in tensive resources (e.g., seed foods), territorial packing along rivers, and nutritional deficien cies in humans (Brown 1977:168). Barbara Bender (1979, 1985a,b) ap proaches complexity from a Marxist perspec tive. Rather than visualizing social processes in empiricist's terms ?size, scale, organization ? she perceives complexity as a condition fostered by "closure" of the social environment. When movement is constrained in any way by demographic factors, social groups begin to for mulate definitions of eligibility, degree of par ticipation and access to sources of production?the initial forms of inequality in human society (Marquardt 1985:72). Intra- and inter-group relations became arenas for reciprocal exchanges (prestations; Mauss 1967) and the creation of debt, the basis for inequality. Reciprocal exchanges are delayed-return agree ments in which socially induced obligations are paid with surplus production. The social-surplus is controlled by the managers of reciprocal ex changes as they redistribute surplus products. Bender (1985a:58) argues that the initial stages of subsistence intensification and sedentism were encouraged by leaders who promoted then status in alliance and exchange networks by ex erting influence over access to sets of resources. 234</page><page sequence="3">Oneota Mode of Production The problem of explaining the transforma tion to Mississippian societies is thornier when viewed from a structural perspective. If only production for subsistence is considered, it is clear the Mississippian farmers and Archaic hunters and gatherers possessed the resources, technology, knowledge, and household or ganization to subsist without the imposition of higher authority structures. In short, those who labored and consumed their own products con trolled the means and organization of produc tion. Peebles and Kus (1977:426-427) noticed this kind of organizational structure among Hawaiian chiefs, who imposed their authority on economically autonomous populations through ritual acts and shrines. This is politics, domina tion which transcends local decision-making units so there is differentiation (ranking) within the system (Peebles and Kus 1977). Peebles and Kus applied the model of Hawaiian chiefdoms to the Mississippian societies of eastern North America and found evidence for similar or ganizational structures, such as ascribed ranking in mortuary contexts, monumental construction, craft specialization and a hierarchy of settle ment types at the same time there was village self-sufficiency (1977:431-433). Burial data from Oneota sites (Wedel 1959; Hall 1962; Gradwohl 1974:96; Glenn 1974) lack the criteria for ascribed ranking by age groups (see Hodder 1984), and there are no special structures (charnel houses) commonly as sociated with the burial program. The preponderance of adults, particularly males, in cemeteries suggests that status was delineated by age and gender. Grave goods seem to suggest that the symbolic distinctions of hierarchy were levels of "achieved" status: e.g., domestic ar tifacts, personal adornment and personal ownership of ritual paraphernalia. The Oneota settlement pattern is charac terized by widely spaced clusters of large vil lages, seasonal camps and bivouacs on the Prairies Peninsula (Henning 1970; Gradwohl 1974; Tiffany 1979; Gibbon 1983:9; Benn 1984:94; Wedel 1986). Many large village sites, which were reoccupied often over several hundred years, functioned as year-round habita tions from which hunting and collecting forays were launched. Settlements were positioned to take advantage of a wide range of prairie, wood land and riparian resources as well as to provide access to arable soils (Harvey 1979; Brown 1982; Gallagher and Stevenson 1982; Michalik 1982; Tiffany 1982). There is no evidence of settlement ranking within the clusters of large villages. Evidence for production on a scale larger than the household (craft specialization) is not found in the Oneota. The Oneota certainly were recipients of exotic materials such as copper, marine shell, Marginella beads, Knife River flint, bison scapulae and finished artifacts like Ramey pottery (Wedel 1959; Hall 1962; Hen ning 1970; Harvey 1979; Overstreet 1981). They also exploited the catlinite quarries in south western Minnesota. Exotic materials moved through inter-group alliances, but their final crafting and utilization occurred within the household as the archaeological evidence indi cates that finished and discarded objects and waste materials are scattered in village middens and cemeteries. There is no evidence for spe cialized craft production in precincts of villages. The scale of extra-household production of crafts, including catlinite, is not significantly dif ferent from that of preceding Woodland cul tures. The Oneota lacked the complex organiza tional characteristics of Mississippian chief doms; yet, the Oneota employed many of the symbols and artifacts of Mississippian culture, particularly some of the Southern Cult sym bolism. Such symbolism seems enigmatic within the Oneota social structure. Explaining this con tradiction between social structure and its sym bols can be accomplished by moving to a deeper analysis of how symbols justify systems of social production. Four aspects of Oneota society will be examined in the following pages: (1) the man ner in which the economic base (i.e., raw materials, tools, subsistence strategies) was in tegrated into a mode of production (i.e., rela tions between producers, products and distribution), and how the mode of production was transformed by the shift from a hunting and gathering base to horticulture (Gibbon 1982:2); 235</page><page sequence="4">David W. Benn (2) the nature of competition between emergent Oneota and indigenous Woodland peoples (Gibbon 1972; Hurley 1974); (3) the spread of the Oneota mode of production across the Mid west (Tiffany 1979; Dobbs 1982; Brown 1982); and (4) the ideologic meaning and context of the introduction of various traits peculiar to Oneota and Mississippian cultures. METHODS OF INQUIRY Until recently, Oneota studies have been characterized by indulgence in empiricism and avoidance of historical process. Explanations for the origin and development of Oneota society have dissolved one after another as new finds of empirical evidence or the inductive logic of other researchers has been published, e.g., migration (Griffin 1960), diffusion of Mississip pian traits and influence (Hall 1962), develop ment of unspecified ancestors (Henning 1970), development from resident Woodland cultures (Gibbon 1974; Hurley 1974). Some ar chaeologists have realized that classification of traits, which composes the bulk of knowledge about Oneota, will never produce explanations about Oneota development, because ideology and history of a people cannot be epistemologi cally ignored for "facts" (Saitta 1983a:300). So cial process is emerging in some considerations of Oneota (e.g., Gibbon 1972, 1982; Brown 1982), but an historical perspective and an economic method of inquiry have yet to be ap plied to the Oneota question and to American archaeology in general (cf. Price 1982). The method of my inquiry was exemplified first by Karl Marx, whose methods have been modernized for anthropological research by many scholars (e.g., Althusser 1969; Bender 1981,1985a, b; Block, ed. 1975; Friedman 1974; Godelier 1972; Marquardt 1985; Sahlins 1976; Terray 1972; Wolf 1982). The fundamental basis of the neo-Marxist methodology is the recogni tion of the essential determinancy of the economic element in social formation, and the reciprocal interactions of that economic ele ment with all other aspects of society (Har rington 1976:192-200). The malleable form of the economic element is the mode of production (MOP), which is composed of the forces of production (tools and labor), relations between producers (relations of production), and an ideological component related to the specific form of the productive system. The MOP may encompass many labor processes (e.g., fishing, hunting, cultivating) which are embedded in the relations of production. In the kin-based MOP of pre-state societies (see Wolf 1982) there are no purely economic institutions that dominate (Godelier 1978a), for in such societies the means of reproducing the social group (kinship) is the same as the relations of production (the economic element). In other words, people who are related by descent and marriage produce everything they need to live and reproduce (Sah lins 1972; Hindness and Hirst 1975). That cultural conceptions, such as kinship relations and ideology, appear to dominate practical action is part of what makes Oneota and other kin-based social formations appear inscrutable for scientific inquiry. This is an il lusion, an up-side-down relation of the old anthropological problem of "ideal" vs. "real." The relations of production must ultimately determine human consciousness because value, the measuring stick of human existence, is so cially constituted (Marx 1906:11-12). In kin based social formations, kinship is the "way of committing social labor to the transformation of nature through appeals to filiation and mar riage, and to consanguinity and affinity" (Wolf 1982:91). Although members of a kinship group often labor separately, the value of their labor is "socialized" among the kindred's membership because their products are shared (Hindness and Hirst 1975; Barnett and Silvermen 1979). In this way, kinship is the governing structure in the allocation of authority over the control of everyone's labor. Ideology is an intellectual account with which people explain their behavior and inter pret reality. Ideology is expressed as myth (sym bolic expression) and religious rites (symbolic actions) which validate the structure and social relations of the MOP and thereby ensure the continuation of production and reproduction of 236</page><page sequence="5">Oneota Mode of Production the social formation. Ideological thought and practice are the products of specific forms of so cial production and can change with the trans formation of relations between producers (Godelier 1978b:4). Ideology also has an ahis torical aspect passed from generation to genera tion as a means of insuring the reproduction of society. In the following pages, this body of theory is applied in an investigation of the development and structure of the Oneota society. First, the tribalization process is modeled and analyzed, then a new formulation about Oneota sym bolism and the process of expansion is developed. TRIBALIZATION "Tribe" is a term designating a social forma tion without fixed ranks in which production is promoted and shared by extended kin groups and by pan-residential structures (Sahlins 1968:14-27; Service 1975:109-132; Keesing 1981:183-189; Braun and Plog 1982:504). The notion of a tribal formation is used here as a con venience because it fits with the absence of ascribed status in Oneota society; yet, a kin based MOP can be modeled to include the ele ment of politics. Modeling Karl Marx declared that value arises from the productive labor of humans and, therefore, is produced as man reproduces himself and his society. Value can be construed in different ways because it is constituted in various labor contexts and is transformed through social exchange. Value in the form of material products and in the form of people (e.g., labor, biological reproduction) is exchanged in reciprocal ar rangements. When products are exchanged, the product's simple use-value is supplemented by the social relationship between exchangers, creating exchange-value which is a social surplus. When people are exchanged, their labor is put to use (e.g., as indentured servants, slaves, domestic help), but in the case of women then biological potential is far more important to kin based societies. Levi- Strauss (1949) pointed out that bride exchange is a transaction of female labor and reproductive potential. This makes kinship part of the economy because kinship is the primary mechanism for reproducing labor (Godelier 1977; Gregory 1984). As with the ex change of products, the exchange of women also creates a social-surplus, variously expressed as brideprice and other forms of prestige. Regarding tribal organizations, the preced ing theoretical perspective leads Sahlins (1972), Friedman and Rowlands (1978), Keesing (1981), Wolf (1982,1984), Saitta (1983b) and Bender (1979,1985a) to focus on the production and distribution of social-surpluses as a means of explaining the history and development of complex social formations. Accumulations of value in social-surpluses is one indicator of human inequality and a means by which in dividuals acquire wealth and status and contrive to dominate the processes of reproduction? biological, social and economic. Social surpluses are created because domestic units, even in the simplest form, cannot be totally autonomous. Units must exchange mates and support one another during times of stress; therefore, relations between units generate surpluses to facilitate reciprocity and con solidate alliances through exchange of surplus (Sahlins 1972; Wilmsen 1973; Godelier 1975; Weissner 1982). Exchange networks become arenas for the creation of social differences in the form of accumulated reciprocity, or debt (Hindness and Hirst 1975:55; Bender 1979:210, 1985a:55). Reciprocity depends on the principle of delay-return (Mauss 1967). This is obvious in the case of bride exchange and the norm for product surpluses which takes time to accumulate. In delay-return systems, leaders insure access to resources by exploiting the labor of kin to con vert raw materials into products and by propagating alliances for the exchange of surpluses that guarantee future access (Bender 1979:212). Control of surplus production and labor reproduction forms the basis for a source of power in systems where status is achieved. Meillassoux (1972), Godelier (1977), Friedman 237</page><page sequence="6">David W. Benn and Rowlands (1978), Bender (1979:212) and Clammer (1985:101) have, therefore, identified one kind of authority as the maintenance of so cial knowledge?alliance rules, genealogies, his tory, marriage regulations, customs, magic and divination. As this type of authority is promoted through kinship, those with power will act to reproduce their influence across generations, so the aspects of authority become embedded in the descent system. Social complexity stems from the gradual institution of inequality within the kinship and descent structures such that all members accept relations of dominance and compliance as the inevitable condition. When dominant relations extend beyond the kinship network to encompass other autonomous units, they are said to be linked by politics (Service 1975:49). The immediate problem for this paper is utilizing the preceding model to investigate the structure of Oneota society. I will focus on some critical aspects; notably, how labor-value was produced and distributed and what types of authority structures existed. It is hypothesized that a social-surplus was produced by specific forms of social structures that also justified production and differential distribution of the surplus among kin groups ?the tenets of tribal organization. Manifestations of social structures which controlled and manipulated the social surplus would include, first and foremost, a dif ferentiated membership (cf. Cohen 1985:109-112). The social formation should be differentiated into parallel subdivisions, some holding priority over others, particularly in ceremonial activities. The differences between subdivisions should be solidified by tradition (descent rules) and stereotyped in ways that would be advertised for all to know and ap preciate. The subdivisions should have assigned rights and privileges with ideological justifica tions which determine access to resources and reproductive advantages. The Oneota Evidence Oneota subsistence is generally charac terized by a seasonal round of aquatic harvest ing, maize and native seed farming, wild seed harvesting, and large game hunting in the wood lands and prairies (Mason 1966:193; Henning 1970:144; Gibbon 1972:175; Savage 1978; Tatum 1979; Tiffany 1982:10; Brown 1982:111-112; Wedel 1986:51-55). Recently, Gallagher and others (Gallagher, et al. 1985) have presented evidence from the Upper Mississippi River val ley showing the Oneota developed an intensive agricultural system with improved strains of maize grown in ridged fields. Evidence for inten sive agriculture postdates A.D. 1200, while maize horticulture dates back to the Late Wood land period in the same region (Benn 1980; Ar zigian 1987). Even if it can be shown that improvements in maize growing contributed to the economic success of Oneota, maize produc tion cannot be cited as the explanation for the emergence of the Oneota way of life. Brown (1982:111-112) is probably correct in his asser tion that the non-intensive nature of early Oneota maize cultivation was adequate to supp ly needs because this crop was productive, even in the northern limits of the Midwest, and be cause Oneota populations did not have a high population that threatened carrying capacity of the environment. The analysis of the Oneota economic base is better viewed in terms of the total labor invest ment in all labor processes. Swidden horticul ture required large groups of kin to clear fields, plant crops, hoe weeds, defend plants from predators, harvest, and protect granaries and seed corn from scavengers and raids (cf. Bloch 1975:212). Gathering activities demanded sporadic episodes of cooperative labor or seasonal efforts by individuals at specific loca tions. Cooperative labor was essential for hunt ing large game animals, as in the case of the Oneota's propensity for extended bison hunting expeditions on the prairies (Wedel 1986:51-52). For extended hunts, a group of hunters and bur den-bearers was necessary, while some in dividuals remained in the village to protect storehouses of resources. In short, any subsis tence formula for pursuing bison and elk on the prairies and maintaining a major investment in crops required a division of labor among many personnel. I surmise that the critical factor in the 238</page><page sequence="7">Oneota Mode of Production emerging Oneota MOP was not access to raw materials but obtaining adequate amounts of labor and utilizing resources in a strategic fashion. Attracting, organizing and retaining sup plies of labor as kin groupings must be the prin cipal role of family authorities. As theorized above, authorities in kin-based systems control labor through manipulation of the labor-value in commodities and in human reproduction (women). To find evidence for these processes in the Oneota, the evidence for social and politi cal structure, available in bits and pieces in the ethnographies of tribes with historic connec tions to the prehistoric Oneota, must be ex amined. Accounts of the Winnebago (Radin 1923) are the most thorough and insightful, and there are less detailed studies of the Ioway (Skinner 1926; Wedel 1986) and Oto (Whitman 1937). Little information exists for the Missouri Indians. People of the Winnebago, Ioway, Oto and Missouri tribes are described as having lived in large villages and having moved frequently. Be cause the tribes were badly decimated by war and disease, actual human numbers are debated with estimates ranging up to 10,000 Winnebago (Hall 1962:154); at least 1000 or more for each of the Ioway (Mott 1938:235), Oto and Missouri (Henning 1961:24-25). The real numbers are not as significant as their relative densities. The Winnebago are said to have lost 500 warriors from a single war party caught in a storm on Lake Michigan (Hall 1962:152), and the entire tribe of Ioway, Missouri and Oto are said to have resided in only one or two villages (Whitman 1937; Mott 1938; Henning 1961). Additionally, the archaeological evidence, in the form of clusters of large Oneota villages, is consistent with historic period observations that the population was concentrated. The social organizations of the Winnebago, Ioway and Oto villages consisted of moieties and clans (gens; Radin 1923; Skinner 1926; Whitman 1937). The Winnebago moieties were sky ("those from above") and earth ("those from below"), and their function was the familiar type of dualism?to regulate marriages and provide a basis for complementary participation in ritual activities. Moieties cross-cut villages, while clans may have been residential aggregates (Radin 1923). In all three tribes, patrilineages belonged to the clans, each of which functioned in several ways for the communal production and reproduction (e.g., to control agricultural fields and produce, initiate novitiates, allocate mar riages, conduct mortuary ceremonies, par ticipate in tribal councils, conduct public ceremonies and feasts, practice raiding and war). Cross-cutting the clan and lineage struc tures were religious societies (Winnebago) and sodalities (Ioway, Oto) whose members func tioned as officers for rituals and feasts and as leaders of war parties. Overseeing village life was a tribal council of clan elders and among the Winnebago a principal elder, or "chief." Radin's (1923) account of the Winnebago is sufficiently detailed to show the subdivisions (clans) or society were differentiated and prioritized. Skinner (1926:190, 251) and Whit man (1937:32,46,85-86) use more general terms like "class" and "caste" to indicate similar kinds of privilege among the Ioway and Oto. In all three societies, men could move upward in the leadership network by passing through a series of offices, but the top positions of war and peace chiefs came only from certain clans. The moiety burial practices differed (inhumation for "earth people," scaffold burial for "sky people"), and clans were assigned specific ceremonial func tions because they kept village bundles. The mechanism of stereotyping group membership was inherent in the clan structure and expressed as clan names, face painting, modes of dress, council seating and as reciprocal clan obliga tions. The degree to which clan priorities of Win nebago society were solidified is not clear in every instance, but here are some examples. The sky moiety contained the Thunderbird clan, the pre-eminent clan from which the village "peace" chief was chosen. The Warrior clan, which was paired with the Thunderbird clan, also belonged to the upper division and conducted wars for the tribe. War was one of the most important ele ments of Winnebago and Ioway tribal existence 239</page><page sequence="8">David W. Benn (Radin 1923:156; Skinner 1926:205-7), and it will be shown later how significant the "thunderbird" motif was. The Bear clan of the lower division had important responsibilities as sociated with policing the village. Other clans also had responsibilities, some of which are now vague or forgotten. The major communal feasts and ceremonies, particularly those associated with war and life-renewal, could not be con ducted without specific bundles and the par ticipation of the bundle holders (i.e., clan heads). Male members, and by association, their families achieved social and political standing through feats of bravery in war. Clans were assigned rights and privileges in community feasts and rituals, with many rights and privileges being expressed through recipro cal actions between permanently paired clans (e.g., burial activities, functionaries in religious societies). The hierarchy of privilege in Win nebago society was manifested most strongly in the Thunderbird clan and its office of village chief (Radin 1923:207-211), the dominant leader. This office was filled from the member ship of "a few families" (Radin 1923:209) with the clan, indicating, it is assumed, socio economic priority for a few families (called "aristocratic lineages" by Godelier 1978b:8). Furthermore, the bonding between paired clans obligated members to fulfill "every possible privilege" (Radin 1923:201), thereby creating the opportunity for the advantages of reciprocity to flow upward in the tribal hierarchy. The dominance of one chief within the bilateral clan structure is an indication of asymmetrical politi cal dualism in complex societies (Friedman 1982:184). Bundles are the key element for under standing the connections among supernatural power, prioritized offices of authority and the control of labor in the historic tribes. The tribe maintained relations with supernatural spirits through totemic symbols in bundles. Bundles were the indispensable centerpieces of com munal ceremonies, which periodically cleansed tribal and spiritual relations. Bundles were as sembled by clan leaders through directives received in supernatural visions, and the village bundles were inherited within specific clans. Thus, descent within the clan gave priority status to the clan bundle keeper. Clammer (1985;104) terms this structural relation the "ideology" of social organization, because authority is vested in kinship and descent through communal ad herence to supernatural precendence. The bundles represented authority and stood for fetishized production (in the Marxian sense; see Friedman 1974). Supernatural authority was employed by clan leaders to justify and reinforce their control of the daily labor processes in the lineage, making it possible to amass the social-surplus for the benefit of the lineage and clan, the ultimate source of power in the Chiwere Siouxan tribes. The surplus con sisted of symbolic items: e.g., elaborate clothing, utensils, deer robes, trade materials and foodstuffs for feasts. Clan heads controlled preparations for feasts and ceremonies, the primary outlets for consumption of surplus production and maintained the necessary bundles for these occasions. SYMBOLISM AND HEGEMONY The preceding scenario shows how tribal leaders could accumulate and reproduce status, wealth and prestige by manipulating the labor value of kin. Bundles representing supernatural power and fetishized social-surplus could have been the device used by the Oneota leadership to embed their authority in the kinship hierar chy. It is appropriate now to explore how the emerging Oneota system was expressed exter nally, because this will explain their expansion ary tendency. My perspective will extend beyond Oneota society to encompass fields of ideologi cal meaning (cf. Wolf 1984) common to many tribal societies in the eastern United States (Hall 1980). Modeling Ideology is defined as a "mode of interven tion in social relations, carried on through prac tice, which secures the reproduction... of the social formation..." when there are contradic tions in the structure of society and its in 240</page><page sequence="9">Oneota Mode of Production dividuals or groups (Shanks and Tilley 1982:131). The central elements in the ideologies of hunters and gatherers and hor ticulturalists are taken from nature. The mind of pre- capitalist people thinks about nature by analogy; everything about nature is anthropomorphized in metaphor (Fernandez 1974). The realities and invisible force in nature are invested as beings with souls, consciousness and power so that they may communicate with people and other imagined beings. Out of na ture, human thought creates a double of itself, an ideal representation of nature as a world of people-beings which is an illusory expression of objective existence (Godelier 1977:178). The il lusion of continuity between spirit-beings and humans is a powerful, all-encompassing ideol ogy represented to participants as the only natural, organic system of life. The consequence of illusory thinking about nature is the creation of a cosmology which func tions to link control of social labor with the power to influence the forces of nature. By this mechanism, authority in the kinship network is linked with symbolic expression (myth) and ac tion (ritual) (Godelier 1982; Bender 1985b:25). This linkage is realized in three forms: (1) cos mology represents a means of knowing and ex plaining what is presumed to be reality, in short, of accounting for the order of things in the world; (2) cosmology is a means for influencing (coercing) ideal characters and forces of nature through the application of ritual, admonition and prayer; (3) as bundle keepers, leaders util ize access to cosmological powers to validate and enhance their social status and control so cial production (Friedman 1975:172). In the hands of leaders, ideological categories in cos mology are used to deny or mystify structural contradictions in society, represent sectional in terests as universal and reify the past and present (Shanks and Tilley 1982:132). This means that the control of social labor is inherent in the ideology of a kin-based MOP and is mo nopolized by some members with the consensus of the whole of society (Godelier 1982:240). The monopolizing of authority is ac complished by metaphorical activity (Fernan dez 1974) which conceals (fetishizes) the ex change of labor-value behind cosmic ideology. In non-state societies, any form of domination by one segment must be maintained by repeated actions (e.g., feasts, ritual and obligations) and recurrent symbolism, because there are no over arching social institutions to assume this func tion (Shanks and Tilley 1982:133). Metaphorical activity involves the rejuvenation of the ideal so cial consciousness by acting out the dialectic be tween social action and the "ideal" way to reproduce the social formation. In midwestern Indian societies, rituals most strongly expressing this dialectic were mortuary ceremonies and "first fruit" celebrations. The Oneota are ex pected to have had these types of ideational ex pressions, stated by the following hypotheses. (1) Symbolic motifs taken from nature should express a hierarchy of power. Domina tion by a social group should be manifested through the monopolization of the symbols of descent from cosmic beings. Motifs should have a limited range of variation because they express specific activities. Motifs should be abstracted representations of cosmic themes. In social organizations where prestige and labor control are monopolized, the inheritance of status by primogeniture develops as a nearly universal pattern (Service 1975:74). Headmen (e.g., lineage heads, elders and political leaders), who can afford to provide feasts for vil lage functions, obviously are successful because of their good relations with the cosmos (their so cial-surplus is the "work of the gods") and be cause of their close genealogical relationship with spirits (they have more "influence;" Fried man 1975:173). By this logic, political develop ment replicates the form of the appropriation of labor-value and of the religious ideology that justifies access to social-surpluses. According to this reasoning, the internal politics of the Oneota should take this form: (2) Manifestations of hierarchical structure and a dominant group should be evident in so cial relations and should be expressed as sym bol. Social and symbolic dualism should reflect the symmetry of the socio-economic system. 241</page><page sequence="10">David W. Benn The late Woodland period (ca. A.D. 350-) in the Midwest apparently encompassed a brief cessation of inter-regional exchange following the disappearance of the Hopewell pattern (Brown 1977:173; Braun and Plog 1982) and a concurrent increase in the signs of conflict (e.g., fortifications, mortuary evidence of violent death and warrior symbolism). Thereafter, inter-regional exchange resumed with the emer gence of Mississippian and Oneota societies (Brown 1977:174). Chert hoes, marine and freshwater shell, copper, other exotics and perishables like salt, meat, skins and feathers moved through the Mississippian exchange net work. The Oneota were interested in catlinite, shell, bison parts (robes, tongues, scapulae) and cult objects. Some authors have expressed the relationship between exchange and war in a suc cinct manner: warfare is the absence of ex change (Service 1975:61; Friedman 1982:179). A model must consider both institutions of ex change and endemic warfare as serving to promote the reproduction of the social forma tion (unless devolution of the social formation is occurring due to internal contradictions). The bridging concept between the proces ses of exchange and warfare is that both ac tivities reinforce dominant relations in social production. When accomplished on a societal scale, the expressions of dominance coalesce as cultural hegemony?hegemony in the sense of Wolfs "ideology-making" (Adams cited in Wolf 1984:396), i.e., power wielded to structure and limit the activities of groups of people. I will employ the concept of hegemony in two forms (Gramsci 1971p Adamson 1980:170-1711): as control achieved through social consensus and as a common awareness of cultural interests. The demise of the Hopewell Interaction Sphere (ca. 100 B.C.- A.D. 200) did not signal the dissolution of Woodland society nor wasting away of leadership roles, but rather, the reor ganization of the processes of surplus produc tion. The corporate hierarchy of Hopewell society fragmented into disseminated social groups (see Braun and Plog 1982), with each group inheriting the competitive social environ ment of the past without the old over-arching belief system (i.e., Hopewell) to reify dominant roles. Woodland leaders would have had to re establish control over sources of production to generate a social-surplus for inter-regional ex change. This was when food production in the form of maize horticulture began to proliferate in the Midwest during the Late Woodland period (Hall 1980; Keegan 1987). Food produc tion made it possible for autonomous social units to be self-supporting and produce a surplus, but it transformed the system of labor value. As more labor was put into food produc tion, more labor-value was committed to the delay-return system, thereby increasing the number of opportunities for obligating debts based on the value of social labor. Emerent Oneota leaders headed delay return economies, drawing a mutually recog nized form of power from the social-surplus they controlled. This power was an incipient form of hegemony?awareness of a common conscious ness which fostered alliances and pitted leaders in contention for sources of labor-value. Hegemonic actions solved two problems for the dominant authorities: they achieved control over raw materials like bison, lithic sources, cop per and catlinite; and they obtained more labor through the absorption of other groups. New op portunities for status were realized through acts of war and raiding. The hegemonic state of tribal organization, termed "predatory expansion" (Sahlins 1961), has been analyzed by other authors (see references in Service 1975:64-70). Hegemony in the Oneota system should take this form: (3) Ideological symbolism should express aggressive themes which relate the cosmos to the leaders and the social system. Symbols of con sensual hegemony should be utilized inside and outside Oneota society to reinforce loyalties and extend themes of dominance to other ethnic groups. The Oneota Evidence My investigation of hegemonic symbols begins with Oneota ceramics. The usual vessel is a globular olla with flamboyant decorations trailed in the soft paste of vessel shoulders and 242</page><page sequence="11">Oneota Mode of Production sometimes lips and interior rim surfaces. Near ly all Oneota motifs span one-quarter to one half the circumference of the shoulder, so motifs cannot be interpreted from sherds. A considera tion of complete motifs not only leads to the con clusion that decorative motifs were shared by Oneota groups (Tiffany 1979:100), but also that a majority of the motifs represent less than a half-dozen subjects rendered in many design variations. This analysis will focus on the prin cipal design in all prairie Oneota iconography, the chevron. The chevron element is represented in many forms: nested lines and/or dots, pendant triangles, chevrons crammed at oblique angles, and sometimes fields of vertical or oblique lines substituted for the chevron. In these variations, the common motif in its least abstracted form is a central, often vertically larger design, flanked by nearly identical nested chevrons (Figs. 2a-c). Other motifs are variants of the same theme often repeated around the vessel (Figs. 2d, e). Balance is an important consideration in Oneota ceramic design. The vessel is partitioned into halves or quadrants, and handles and design ele ments are positioned to reflect the subdivisions. The chevron grouping dominates Oneota motifs throughout the Prairie Peninsula (Table 1). The clearest examples are in Moingona phase ceramics from the Central Des Moines river valley (Osborn 1982) and related Bur lington phase ceramics from southeast Iowa (Straffin 1971; Tiffany 1979) (Figs. 3f, g, h), in the Correctionville phase in northwestern Iowa (Henning 1961; Harvey 1979) (Fig. 3d) and in the Blue Earth Oneota material in Minnesota (Wilford 1955; Gibbon 1983) (Fig. 3e). Ceramics from the Utz site in north-central Mis souri (Henning 1970; Chapman 1980) are more stylized and abstracted (Fig. 3i). The Orr Phase motifs from northeastern Iowa (Wedel 1959) have fields of dots and lines (Fig. 3b). The most stylized use of chevrons is found in Wisconsin Oneota materials, particularly the Diamond Bluff and Carcajou Point variations (Hall 1962; McKern 1945) (Fig. 3a). This appears to be a water motif (Marshack 1985), a less common division in Oneota iconography which will be discussed later. The concept conventionalized into chev rons in most Oneota pottery is vividly illustrated on a vessel shoulder from the Bryan site, a Sil vernale phase village near Red Wing, Minnesota (Link 1975). The Bryan motif (Fig. 4a) includes birds with spotted breasts, pendant triangle tails and nested chevron wings. Link (1975) relates the bird motif to Mississippian eagle and hawk symbolism and to the thunderbird cosmology of northern, Historic Siouxan tribes, although he does not connect the Bryan bird motif with Oneota chevron designs. Similarity between the Bryan bird and the least stylized Oneota motifs is self-evident (Fig. 2), while the most abstract motifs in the Orr phase material can be accepted as parts of the bird (Fig. 3b; Table 1). The notion that the nested chevron is a styl ized representation of the thunderbird's wing has been noted by Lothson (1976:39), who passed this idea in his interpretation of "bird men" petroglyphs of northeast Iowa and southern Minnesota. The wings of some "bird men" have the same form as the nested chevron (Fig. 4b). I would note that the bodies of many "bird-men" have a pendant triangle element also in the tail of the Bryan birds and in the central design of Oneota ceramic motifs (Figs. 4b, g, h). Hall (1983) also has noted the thunder bird tail and chevron motif in Oneota iconog raphy and related it to Mississippian iconography. The notion of "bird-men" relates to another aspect of Oneota iconography? repre sentational depictions probably done in ritual contexts. Some of these depictions consist of petroglyphs not positively attributed to Oneota authorship, although most scholars accept the connection (Lothson 1976). The two most famous "bird-men" (Fig. 4d) were carved on a rock cliff overlooking the Mississippi River in northeastern Iowa (Orr 1949). "Thunderbirds" and "bird-men" are abundant in southern Min nesota sites (Figs. 4b,c, g, h; Winchell 1911; Lothson 1976). Stone tablets from Iowa also depict "bird-men."

Figures of birds on stone tablets, especially cat linite, are fantastic creatures composed of ele ments from different species.

(Copper serpent figures have been found in Oneota sites [e.g., Wedel 1959:72; Harvey 1979:91], and a snake is trailed on the shoulder of an Oneota vessel now residing the the collec tion of the Historical Society in Iowa City.) Identification of birds in the iconography of Eastern Woodland Indians has been a quiet issue for decades. One group of birds, the wood peckers (ivory-billed Campephilus principalis, and pileated Hylatomus pileatus), have red crests or breasts associated metaphorically with war (Howard 1968:45) (Fig. 7a). Often, only the woodpecker crest and long beak are added to figures of other creatures or humans. The other major bird motif is identified as a raptorial bird because of its hooked beak. In works on Missis sippian symbols published before circa 1968, the raptorial bird is identified as an eagle, usually the "spotted eagle." Howard (1968:43) reasons that the eagle identification is so pervasive be cause many accounts of historic Indian tribes emphasize the eagle as the primary bird in cos mology. However, the eagle is not spotted but dark brown in color. Many authors (e.g., Waring and Holder 1945:4; Byers 1962:213; Brown and Hamilton 1965:44; Howard 1968:37; Brown 1975:22) have identified the bird as a falcon, specifically the peregrine falcon or duck hawk (Falcon peregrinus). Falcons have spotted breasts and speckled and barred underwings, and a dark band beneath (auricular) and above (eye line) the eye presents a "forked-eye" design to the viewer (Fig. 6). Another bird theme is prevalent among prairie cultures?the thunderbird. Thunder birds were important cosmic figures in myths among Algonkian Indians of the boreal and northern hardwood forests. The form of thunderbird depictions usually has a triangular body, open legs and extended wings/arms (Steinbring 1985). Although there seems to have been a conjunction between hawk likenesses and northern thunderbirds (e.g., in Minnesota petroglyphs; Lothson 1976), hawks are embel ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H&amp;-. Fig. 6.

Benn lished with forked eyes, headdresses and other regalia to distinguish their aggressive anthropomorphic functions. Other creatures in the cosmic world of Woodland peoples (cf. Hall 1979,1980) include those in the Effigy Mounds tradition, which preceded Oneota in the same area, where birds, serpents, bears, "turtles" and "panthers" functioned as archetypes of social integration (Mallam 1976). Hawk likenesses in Oneota iconography have obvious affinities with southeastern Missis sippian material (e.g., Hall 1962; Henning 1970; Gibbon 1972, 1974; Strong 1979, 1980a, b), broadly termed Southern Cult (Waring and Holder 1945). The Mississippian iconography is more diverse, with elements not being present in Oneota. Examples of Southern Cult art with close correspondences in Oneota iconography include Spiro site depictions of conventional ized woodpeckers, hawks and falcon-imper sonators on shell and copper (Hamilton, Griffin and Willoughby 1952) replete with wing spots, banded tails, forked eyes and belts/kilts (Figs. 7a-d). Copper bird figures were widely traded, some having appeared in the Oneota areas of Wisconsin (Hall 1962 Vol. 11:112) and in Mis souri (Chapman 1980:188). Another version of the falcon-impersonator (Fig. 7e) was recovered beneath the east lobe of Monks Mound at the Cahokia site, and the elite person buried in mound 72 at Cahokia was resting on a raptorial bird-shaped bed (cape?) of shell beads (Fowler and Hall 1975:8). Much of the Mississippian symbolism has been deciphered, which will assist in interpret ing Oneota symbolism. Brown's statement on ideological subjects in the Spiro mortuary?its art, symbolism, and implications for economics?is germane to the Oneota. There should be little surprise in finding the falcon occupying such an important role in Spiro symbolism, since the falcon is famous for its spectacular aerial attacks that literally knock ducks and smaller birds out of the air....The fal con emerges as a major symbol of aggressive warfare, and is indeed appropriate to employ as a symbol of fierceness and boldness. The stance of the falcon-impersonator is cor respondingly aggressive, since he is often shown brandishing a macelike club in one hand and a human head, or a head-rattle substitute, in the other (Brown 1975:22). For the Mississippians, iconography was a representation of the major cosmic powers in their world and a depiction of how humans acted to manipulate cosmic forces to control their own destinies (Knight 1981). The myths of southeastern tribes are filled with references to giant, man-eating birds variously described as a big crow, giant eagle and giant sharp-breasted hawk or Tlanuwal (Howard 1968:43-44; Hudson 1976:129,136). The giant hawk of the sky may have been associated with thunder (Howard 1968:43-44), and the hawk was the cosmic spirit that made success possible in warfare. In myth and real life the Mississippians usurped the power of the bird by dressing in its regalia, ad ding elements of other creatures to enhance the theme of powerful warrior. We know that humans acted the parts of falcon-impersonators from the remains of kilt skirts and feather robes from the Spiro Mound. The Mississippian cosmos was balanced be tween the Upper world of sun, moon and larger than-life beings, a world of order and predictability, and a Lower world of ghosts and spirits, a world of disorder, chaos and change (Hudson 1976:122-141). Snakes (serpents) and other creatures like the water panther inhabited the Lower World (Howard 1968:49). In many myths, snakes were captured by hawks and/or men to take the serpent's powers for human ap plication. The most horrible of all monsters was called Uktena by the Cherokee and consisted of attributes of the serpent (Under World crea ture), deer (This World creature) and birds (Upper World creatures) (Hudson 1976:131 168). Uktena represented jealousy and social destruction for men, and, therefore, its conquest meant success and an ideally balanced world for humans. This metaphorical tension extended into the political structure as expressed by the duality of Mississippian offices, village war chiefs and priests (Knight 1981:136). For purposes of the Oneota analysis, it is significant that, in their iconography, the Missis sippian elite took for themselves the role of renewing the world balance as falcon-imper 250</page><page sequence="19">Oneota Mode of Production . ^,0 SC?le | ^^^^^^^^^^^ (Hamilton eVol. 1952) ^^^^ | "eagle doncer (Cohokio^ Fowler 19751 "eogle beings' y^./^Z^^^^ (Missouri^ a^^n^5) ^ g Hadfields Cave (Benn 1980) ^^^^^^^^^ _Fairfield Mounff~gTwood 1961)_ Fig. 7.

Leaders became personifications of cosmic power and equilibrium by assuming the role of cosmic giant to compel the populace to conform to idealized modes of behavior. Similarities in Mississippian bird symbolism and the presence of underworld motifs in Oneota are too apparent to ignore, especially since these societies were contemporaneous and shared exchange of materials like catlinite, cop per and shell. The hawk symbolism is so per vasive in Oneota representations that it must be assumed the warrior theme is being expressed. The Oneota falcon-impersonator was in ideal ized human being; a model for warriors who in herited social advantages through descent and had achieved a position of leadership through exploits in war and hunting. (Animals, especial ly bison, are engraved on many catlinite pieces also used to depict hawk-beings.) The skycrea ture/warrior theme was the dominant expres sion in the social and ritual structure of historic tribes as well. For instance, among the Win nebago the paired Thunderbird and Warrior (formerly called Hawk) clans in the Upper moiety controlled the major political functions of the village (Radin 1923:207-219). Powerful shamans and warriors often claimed they were reincarnated thunderbirds, the possessors of all important human powers (Radin 1923:439). The thunderbirds or related likenesses (e.g., Great Black Hawk, Pigeon Hawk, Black Hawk, Eagle; Radin 1923:440-441) played central roles in creation myths and in beliefs ensuring success in warfare and life. The cosmic associations were bolstered by fetishes representing the sky powers in sacred bundles, e.g., hawk skins, woodpecker crests, weapons (Skinner 1926; Radin 1923, 1945; Callender 1962; Blaine 1979:107). These lines of evidence support hypothesis 1 concerning the nature of Oneota symbolic ex pression. The range of variation of dominant symbols is limited to hawk/warrior themes, which pervaded the everyday life of historic tribes. For the Oneota, nature themes (birds, etc.) stood for a hierarchy of spirits in creation myths (Radin 1923; Skinner 1926) and a parallel hierarchy of descent through clans. In material life, the hawk motif was made into a pan-ethnic symbol in ceramic paste. Hypothesis 2 predicts the Oneota hierarchy should have one pre-eminent unit in social prac tice and symbolism, and expressions of dualism should reflect an asymmetrical character. Among Historic tribes this is evident, in part, in the dominance of the upper moiety and its Thunderbird clan, which was paired with the Warrior clan. The iconographic symbolism also strongly favors sky elements. Dualism existed in the social structure?the clans, their earth and sky totems and their ritual obligations?and it is evident in the iconography of underworld crea tures and in the fetishes of water and earth crea tures contained in bundles. Radin (1945:54-55) stated a consistent theme in Winnebago society was the struggle against chaos and the renewal of order through ritual and a balance of leader ship in the Thunderbird and Bear clans. In chief doms and emerging states the leader typically usurps both religious and secular leadership roles (Becker, cited in Hall 1983:6; Peebles and Kus 1977). Historic Mississippian societies were characterized by an exaggeration of dual roles to express the social and cosmic tensions which the leader was obliged to quash to renew society for another year (Knight 1981). In the prehis toric Oneota system, hawk symbolism seems to be combined with earth-water motifs, implying that birds captured serpents. For instance, hawk-men and birds with antler headdresses (Figs. 4d, 5f) and serpent teeth (Figs. 5a, b) are examples of combined elements, but the clearest expression of dominance is on the Lansing tablet (Fig. 4f). This hawk-man has an upside-down four-legged creature on his torso. The creature is like Ne-gjig, the Great Otter, an underworld creature of Algonkin mythology (Cleland, et al. 1984). A similar creature is on the forehead of Figure 5f. Hypothesis 3 states that aggressive symbolic themes will be part of the social structure. Hegemonic symbols should be applied inside and outside the society to express dominance and loyalty. Consensual hegemony can be visual ized in activities which leave artifactual evidence and in institutional expressions of a 252</page><page sequence="21">Oneota Mode of Production cultural system. The artifactual evidence is presented first. Oneota cemeteries often contain rocks in piles, lenses of fill or capstones with burials. These are common features of the preceding Woodland periods. Whole vessels or a few shell tempered sherds often are positioned next to the body (Harvey 1979:141; Wedel 1959:45). Other features of Oneota cemeteries include many in stances of Oneota burials and pots intruded into Woodland mounds or Oneota burials as primary features within mounds in Wisconsin and Iowa (Wedel 1959; Hall 1962; Harvey 1979). One "empty" mound excavated by the writer on the Upper Iowa River contained two cupped Oneota sherds placed on a central earthen pedestal (Benn and Bettis 1977). The Blood Run Oneota site (13L01; Harvey 1979:135) in northwestern Iowa contained over 150 mounds and numerous boulder outlines. The current view about Oneota using "Woodland" traits is that these were cases of cultural syncretism. In deed, this is so, but from the viewpoint of con temporaneous Woodland peoples, the Oneota expropriation of "their" burial rituals must have seemed like a form of subjugation. For the emerging Oneota, winning the minds of poten tial new members from other cultures probably was the most critical part of the process of syncretizing different belief systems into the Oneota "way." Oneota politics had to be aggres sively geared toward deracinization of com petitors. This is why Oneota iconography and artifacts are so uniform across the Midwest; tri angular arrow points, shell tempered pottery, elbow pipes, end scrapers and other tool forms are recognized as Oneota items on any site. Uniform symbols express power; uniformity is a metaphor for the recognition of the primacy of the Oneota relations of production. Robert Hall (1983) has happened on an ex ample of consensual hegemony in his cognitive approach to the Oneota-Mississippian problem. Through linguistic relationships, he notes that the Winnebago were referenced as the Puants (Stinkards) by the French and as the lower cos mological division by other Indian tribes. At the same time, Menominee myths tell of a relation ship between the Bears (Menominee civil leaders who collected wild rice) and Thunderers (war chiefs who lived on Lake Winnebago and had corn). The Menominee had just such a relationship of exchange (rice-corn) with the Winnebago tribe, and Hall wonders if the Win nebago did not once have a similar dual relation ship with the Chiwere Sioux (the Thunderers), who became the Ioway, Missouri and Oto. I would add that a Winnebago relationship with Mississippians, via Cahokia, would conform to this pattern: e.g., Winnebago as lower division, Mississippians as upper division. The water motifs on Oneota pots from eastern Wisconsin would seem to fit the pattern. This is a case of institutionalized politics extending over all the tribes in the Midwest. Notice how dual roles of tribes can be reversed situationally, e.g., the Winnebago as Thunderers for the Menominee and as the lower division for the Mississippians. Likewise, Chiwere Oneota tribes on the prairies probably were "Thunderers" to their contem porary Woodland residents. THE WOODLAND-ONEOTA TRANSITION I contend it was not a substantial shift in the subsistence base that fostered Oneota culture. Rather, an internal reorganization of productive relations necessitated by historical process (socio-political interaction) redefined the roles of Late Woodland producers within descent groups. In this scenario, leadership roles were emphasized through associations with cosmic archetypes in order to organize labor to extract natural and horticultural resources and trans form them into social-surplus. The symbols of aggressive leadership became embedded in bundle ceremonialism which carried the reproductive ideology of descent groups. Labor value was attracted to and concentrated in the descent groups, bolstering their corporate awareness?a manifestation of hegemony. In short, the definitions of "social distance" be tween interlinked descent groups and "other bands" were changed by a pan-regional aware ness of dominant productive relations. 253</page><page sequence="22">David W. Benn This was an uneven process on the Prairies Peninsula. Some Late Woodland systems resisted change by retreating into the isolation of kin-based bands, while other systems under went alteration as leadership roles were exag gerated in the daily competition for economic influence. The transformation from the Wood land to Oneota mode of production was relative ly rapid, perhaps in a few generations. Concentrated labor was able to better defend its products, and the loose aggregate-band of Woodland derivation became the Oneota vil lage of archaeological parlance. From its "heardand" of permanent village locales, the tribe could range over the former territories of Woodland bands, because the village member ship was large enough to undertake extended hunts and protect the base camp. Thus, the his toric Ioway tribe is recorded as ranging over all of Iowa with only colonially-induced competi tion for space (Mott 1938). Archetypes, like the hawk-impersonator, held sway over the consciousness of humans so that the politization process entered into all forms of existence. The tribe became a political and territorial entity with a hierarchical network of leaders, sodalities, lineages and totems. As the community membership grew and leader ship positions multiplied and conflicted, seg ments of the community inevitably fissioned. The leaders of new segments had to produce their own social-surplus to attract adequate sup plies of labor, so the Oneota MOP was com pelled to expand as each segment reproduced. The Oneota displaced competitors and incor porated new supplies of labor by capturing women and adopting children to clan affilia tions. This is attested by rapid Oneota expan sion, the dissolution of Woodland cultures on the central Prairies Peninsula by A.D. 1200, and by the multi-ethnic character of the Oneota (see Glenn 1974; Springer and Witkowski 1982). Much has been written about why the material assemblage of Oneota is so different from that of Woodland and so similar to other Mississippian assemblages. The requirement for strong, thermally efficient ceramic con tainers for simmering seed foods and extracting tallow from bones influenced many Eastern Woodland cultures to shift to shell tempered pottery (Braun 1983; Brown 1982:108; Bronitsky and Hammer 1986). A similar case can be made for the universalism of "Mississippian" symbols as expressed in commodities (e.g., Ramey pot tery, gorgets, copper plates, Mill Creek chert hoes, long-nosed god masks, catlinite, etc.). For hierarchical authorities, commodity exchanges are managerial devices which provide the basis for communications between potential com petitors and for opportunities to express poten tial "rights" to exploit certain resources. Examples of symbolic commodities abound, and one that also illustrates my earlier point about labor-value is Winters' (1981) examination of Middle Woodland copper tools and Mississip pian chert hoes. In this instance,the occasional copper tool in a Woodland mound represented access to an exchange network, but the produc tion and distribution of masses of Mississippian chert hoes demonstrated control of exchange networks and of organized labor used to manufacture the objects (see Marcucci 1987). Groups participating in commodity exchan ges tend to adopt outwardly the behavior, trap pings and symbolism of dominant groups (Flannery 1968:105; Brown 1975:27-28). This may explain material incongruities in Late Woodland period sites, such as the "jaguar" shell gorget (Fig. 7g) from the Fairfield mound in the Missouri Ozarks (Wood 1961: Fig. 8), Ramey ceramics in the Mouse Hollow rock shel ter in east-central Iowa (Logan 1976:78), and the deer head/coiled rattlesnake gorget (Fig. 7f) from the Hadfields Cave site also in east-central Iowa (Benn 1980). Other symbols of dominance are waiting to be recognized by archaeologists. What the Oneota and Mississippian societies did not have in common is informative about their modes of production. Missing from Oneota iconography and practice are pervasive images of death in an elaborate mortuary struc ture. James Brown has analyzed the Spiro sym bolism in this manner: The premier mortuary is simultaneously a treasury for the managers of exchange and a repository for the remains of the individuals im 254</page><page sequence="23">Oneota Mode of Production portant in acquiring the critical managerial status. The mortuary amounts to a cult head quarters from which the politically significant descendants of the honored dead draw their ideological power.... [R]epeated iconographic reference to the ancestors is not a morbid fas cination but is more credible as a means of as serting the legitimacy of the rulers and revalidating their social control over such im portant resources as agricultural land (1975:15, 17). I would amend Brown's valid reasoning to say that elite managers controlled the social surplus by managing the sources and organiza tion of laborers who produced things of value. Structurally, the Spiro elite were performing the same management functions as the Oneota war rior-elders. Some Mississippian social systems had been transformed into petty classes with the top lineage having ascribed status with the literal power of life and death over their subjects' labor-value. In contrast, the Oneota system developed in a context of less social packing (Brown 1982:111), so there is no evidence for so cial intensification in the form of classes. CONCLUSIONS The Oneota were a unique transformation of culture that does not slot into the rigid empiri cal categories like "Woodland" and "Mississip pian." While it is true that the Oneota were formed from varied sets of concrete circumstan ces among which were population density, en vironmental setting, economic base and historical necessity, they were unique in that their social formation included certain social and ecological contradictions as a result of syncretism between their past and the socio economic structure of their Late Woodland and Mississippian contemporaries. That Oneota culture has been an enigma for archaeological analysis exposes two sources of conceptual problems: the lack of application of methodol ogy which inquires into the structure and com position of political economies, and a paradigm which employs a dialectical perspective of his torical process. If explanations are not pursued for social formations beneath the veneer of ar tifact assemblages and comparmentalized relationships into the deeper structure of producer relations, historical contradictions and dialectical processes, then the need to con nect economy with ideology, the Woodland past with their successor Mississippian chiefdoms, aboriginal cultures with the ethnographic present, and human prehistory with present day societies will never be satisfied. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Support for collecting the data in this paper came from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District, who funded the mitigation of impacts at the Christenson site, Des Moines, Iowa (contract no. DACW25-82-C-0049). Corps archaeologist, Charles Smith, was especially helpful in conducting this field project. Adolph Link made available the Bryan site bird design.
