Sebeok Abstract. - This paper raises the question of what type of interspecific codeswitching occurs between man and animal in experiments designed to teach language-like communication systems to apes. While reports underplay the possible effects of social contamination and other experimenter-induced errors, close analysis of the verbal descriptions of training and testing conditions, observational techniques, relevant photographs, drawings, and films, reveals that a host of methodological pitfalls - from errors in observation, recording and sampling to overinterpretations and fudging of data - beset all phases of ape "language" research. In particular, apes in these experiments, even in double-blind or paper-pencil tests, may be subject to a number of unwitting cues emitted by humans who are prone to underesti- mate both the semiotic acuity of their captive dependents and their own ability to give off and respond to subliminal signs. This critical investigation, seen against a background of studies of human and nonhuman nonverbal communication, sources of deception in behavioral research in general, and information about deceptive communication by animal trainers, stage magicians, and other performers, casts doubt upon the reliability of claims that apes can learn to use a human language. "The peculiarity of the case is just that there are so many sources of possible deception in most of the observations that the whole lot of them may be worthless ... I am also constantly baffled as to what to think of this or that particular story, for the sources of error in any one observation are seldom fully knowable" (William James in Murphy and Bailou 1960: 310, 320). 1. Introduction: Morality Play or Comedy of Manners? It has been justly observed, most recently by the prominent historian Lynn White, Jr. (1979: 74), that "Scientists focus so sharply on objects that they forget to think critically about subjects, that is, themselves."

Left unchecked, years, even decades of human effort - and public funds - can be wasted before a more accurate conception of investigations can be construc- ted, usually with devastating consequences for those who were the victims of self-inflicted blindness. The turn of the decade witnessed a tidal wave of reve- lations about the methodological shortcomings of widely praised, long-term projects - one now in progress almost a decade and a half - designed to teach apes language-like skills. Some attacks came from "insiders," or members of competing experimental teams (e. g., Petitto and Seidenberg 1979; Sanders and Terrace 1979; Seidenberg and Petitto 1979; Terrace 1979, 1980a, 1980Ò; Terrace et al. 1979, 1980) and constitute the latest in a long line of expressions of inter-experimenter hostility * which led Griffin to comment : The leading groups of experimenters training apes to use symbolic communication share a general faith in the significance of the endeavor, but they are often critical of each other's specific experimental procedures. If one accepts the sharpest of these mutual criticisms, it is tempting to dismiss all of the results as inconclusive (1978a: 555). "Outsiders" have also contributed to the debate (e. g., Desmond 1979; Gardner 1980; Hediger 1980; Ristau and Robbins 1979; Sebeok and Umiker-Sebeok ington's Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies.

Sebeok holds the academic titles of Distinguished Professor of Linguistics and Semiotics, Professor of Anthropology, and Fellow of the Folklore Institute, at Indiana University- Bloomington, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1943. In addition, he holds the double administrative titles of Chairman of the Graduate Program in Semiotic Studies and Chairman of the Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies. In 1975, he was President of the Linguistic Society of America, Since 1976, he has served as the Exe- cutive Director of the Semiotic Society of America, which he helped found. He also collaborated in the creation of the Animal Behavior Society (1967-68). In the field of animal communica- tion, his principal contributions are : Perspectives in Zoosemiotics (1972), What the Speech- less Creatures Say (forthcoming, with Jean Umiker-Sebeok), and two recently edited books, the encyclopedic How Animals Communicate (1977), and Speaking of Apes (1980, with Jean Umiker-Sebeok) . 1 For numerous examples of earlier criticisms by ape researchers, see Sebeok and Umiker-Sebeòk 1980.</page><page sequence="3">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 91 19796; Thompson and Church 1980; Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok 1980), the cumulative effect of which has been to partially shift attention away from earlier questions about the nonlinguistic character of the data published by ape "language" researchers and onto the dubious nature of the very procedures employed in training and testing the experimental animals, and the interpre- tations of the results of those procedures. Throughout a number of critical assessments, especially in the popular press, as well as in defensive counterattacks, animals and humans involved are assigned, either openly or by implication, roles appropriate to a degenerate form of morality play, individual apes and experimenters serving as personi- fications of Good and Evil, Beast and Humankind. The allegorization of ape "language" projects stems in large part from two facts: first, the research is still being discussed without the benefit of those branches of zoosemiotics dealing with human and ape nonverbal communication, whether intra- or inter- specific, in scientific or nonscientific settings. Second, despite the considerable variety and number of methodological shortcomings so far uncovered, with more sure to come, little attention has been paid either the vast literature on sources of deception in behavioral research in general or the wealth of infor- mation about deceptive communication available in the oral and written statements of animal trainers, stage magicians, and other performers. Drawing from these varied and underutilized sources, this paper, through the critical evaluation of the self-fulfilling prophecy - particularly the Clever Hans Effect - and kindred methodological pitfalls at play in attempts to teach language skills to apes, demonstrates that such projects, far from being morality plays, are rather a kind of comedy of manners, additional entries in an already thick catalog of fads and fallacies in the name of science (Gardner 1957). Investigators and experimenters, outwardly absorbed by the pursuit of the idealized abstrac- tions which inform their investigations, but driven by somewhat ruthless, down-to-earth aims, have generally failed to check their own personal attitudes, feelings, and expectations, and the role which these play in their interactions with specific experimental animals. Thus we find the ape "language" researches replete with personalities who believe themselves to be acting according to the most exalted motivations and sophisticated manners, but in reality have invol- ved themselves in the most rudimentary circus-like performances. 2. Varieties of Interspecific Communication A common definition of communication involves nothing more than the moving of information in time from one place to another. From this point of view, it is of little consequence whether the trafficked ware consists of random noise, the 1010 bits of information inherent in a strand of DNA programmed to rebuild itself, or some configuration of signs, as a sonata by Mozart, charged with high aesthetic value. If information is available, it can be communicated.</page><page sequence="4">92 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 Semiosis, or a triadic cooperative production involving a sign, its object, and its interprétant (Peirce 1935-1966: 5.484), is as much a criterial attribute of all life as is the ability to metabolize. Whatever form life may assume, two basic activities that sustain interaction with its environment are the packing and discharging of nutrients and gases in order to grow or derive energy, and the processing of signs in order to maneuver and operate information so as to maximize the chances of the survival of its kind. Just as there are different sorts of strategies for metabolic activity, there are also various kinds of communication devices. Plants, for example, are characterized by an autotrophic reaction: the organism derives energy from sunlight. Animals employ heterotrophic reaction: they usually educe nourish- ment from organic compounds outside their own body. Phytosemiosic tech- niques have hardly begun to be scientifically explored, so our knowledge of them is still very much at a rudimentary level. The investigation of the enormous variety of zoosemiotic systems, on the other hand, has long interested humanity, and, during the last quarter of the century, has emerged as the cardinal area of concentration in the biological study of animal behavior (Sebeok 1978a). Broadly speaking, two principal modes of communicative behavior can be demarcated in animals for purposes of research : intraspecific and interspeci- fic. Each species of animal possesses a unique code. By adverting to this code, an amalgam of partially inherited and partially learned components, the con- specific membership can exchange messages that tend biologically and/or socially to promote the welfare of that population. This vast, heterogeneous category of substratal communicative events (Sebeok 1977) will concern us hereafter only incidentally. Interspecific communication, by contrast, always entails more than one specific code, the number depending on the complexity of the ecosystem occu- pied by animals belonging to different species that congregate there to their mutual advantage (Sebeok 1978a: 21). In mixed populations, where members of every participant species necessarily co-exist in some sort of affiliation with individuals of another - in relationships technically known by terms such as parasitism, mutualism, or, more generally, symbiosis - some messages flowing to and fro are registered against a higher-order, as it were, xenogeneic code, a quantum of knowledge of which is necessarily shared by concerned communi- cants belonging to separate but allied species, say, the oxpecker (Buphagus africanas) calling out to the rhinoceros prior to alighting upon its skin, or to the zebra signifying by its posture (legs spread, tail raised, ears drooping) its own readiness to be cleansed. The insects, ticks, or other parasites infesting the quadruped also constitute an essential part of this particular communicative network. The permutation in mutually modif ying response patterns of this second kind can become very elaborate indeed when the members of one species are bar- raged by the displays of one or more others that, in turn, react to displays of theirs. The intricacy of the animal's environment may be heightened further still in the interesting special case when one of the participating species in the system chances to be man. It is upon some varieties of this type of communi- cative dyad that we shall focus in what follows.</page><page sequence="5">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 93 The circumstances under which man may encounter animals, necessita- ting that each party learn - even if never entirely master - the essential elements of the reciprocal's own code, are many and varied. A few of the most common situations in which man/animal interactions take place (cf. Hediger 1969: Ch. 4) can be identified and briefly exemplified: 2.1 Man preys upon, even annihilates, an animal species for different reasons - some, as antelopes, may be hunted down as game, certain carnivores (such as the East African crocodile) condemned as "vermin," primates overused in medical research, marsupials killed for their hide, cetaceans exploited for their oil, or the like (cf. Ehrenfeld 1972). In effect, every time a population of animals is exterminated, a unique communicative code is concurrently and irreversibly eliminated. 2.2 Man becomes the casualty of an animal's depredations, as of the Southeast Asian Anopheles balabacensis, one of perhaps 50 species of this genus, members of which may come into noisome taction with man ; (more people die each year, even now, of mosquito-borne disease than from any other single cause; see Gillett 1973). 2.3 Man co-exists with an animal in some sort of partnership, for example, in a purely guest/host relationship (as aquarium fishes with their master) ; or in a nexus of mutual dependency (such as a Seeing Eye dog working in the service of a blind man, or a cormorant catching fish for a Japanese fisher- man and being rewarded with food according to the size of the catch). 2.4 Parasitism may work in either direction. 2.4.1 The activities of man in relation to the reindeer (Zeuner 1963: 46-48) can, for instance, be described as those of a social parasite. We are the exploiting species, taking advantage of the reindeer's greed, sated only when it licks up salty matter (as human urine) that attracts and binds the animal to human camps. The Masai custom of drinking the blood of their cattle without killing them is another example of parasitism where the human guest lives, especially in times of famine, on body fluids of the host. 2.4.2 It has justly been observed that each of us has about as many organisms on our skin surface as there are people on earth. The mite Detnodex, crab lice, fleas and bedbugs are but a few samples of the teeming miniature para- sitic population sharing our ecology (e. g., Rosebury 1969). 2.5 An animal may accept a human as a conspecific. As early as 1910, Heinroth described the attachment of incubator-hatched greylag goslings to human beings. These goslings reject any goose and gander as parent objects, opting instead to look upon humans as their exclusive parents. Many other hand-reared birds were later found to have transferred their adult sexual behavior toward their human caretaker. Morris and Morris (1966: 182) have recounted attempts by a female panda, Chi-Chi, to mate with her keepers, and the ardent sexual advances of a male dolphin, Peter, toward his female trainer, Margaret Howe, were recorded in her published protocol (Lilly 1967: 274 f.).</page><page sequence="6">94 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 2.6 An animal may define a human as a part of its inanimate environ- ment, 2 as when men are driving through a wildlife park in a closed vehicle. In certain circumstances, small mammals (such as bats, house-mice), and even larger ones (e. g., koala bears) grasp a human limb and, mistaking it for an insensate substrate, will climb it. 2.7 Taming, defined as the reduction, or possibly total elimination, of an animal's flight reaction from man, may be deliberately induced. This is an indispensable precondition both for training and domestication. The latter is a state wherein not only the care and feeding but most particularly the bree- ding of the animal - or communication of genetic information from one gene- ration to the next - have all come (at least to a degree) under human control. (When the biologically altered domesticated animal breaks out of control, it is referred to as "feral," as opposed to "wild.") 2.8 Man trains an animal. Such management may take one of two coun- terpolar forms : 2.8.1 A rat forced to swim under water to escape drowning is taught to take the alley in a submerged Y-maze when the correct decision is indicated by the brighter of the two alleys; a porpoise is brought under behavioral control to locate and retrieve underwater objects. Such efforts are called apprentissage, loosely rendered as "scientific training," or in German, "wissenschaftliche Dressur." 2.8.2 A horse is taught to perform a comedy act for purposes of exhibi- tion (Bouissac 1976 : Ch. 8) ; a porpoise is taught to play basketball. Such efforts are called dressage, or circus (viz. oceanarium) training, or "höhere Dressur." Apprentissage and dressage are fundamentally distinct ways of shaping behavior, although from a semiotic point of view they constitute complementa- ry measures, in particular as regards their pragmatic import. This variance was intuitively appreciated by Hediger as early as in his 1935 dissertation and later substantially advanced in several of his published writings (e. g., 1968: 120 f., 1974). For instance, Hediger insightfully emphasized that apprentissage entails a reduction of the animal-man nexus to as close to zero as may be feasible. Dressage, on the other hand, requires a maximum intensification of the ligature, with the richest possible emotional involvement. This is one dimension along which the signs employed fluctuate. Apropos dressage, the Brelands (1966 : 108) related an interesting informal observation concerning the emotional compo- nent of a parrot's vocalization : in the exhibition in question, the bird picks up a toy telephone, holds it up to his ear, and says "Hello !" - after which he recei- ves a peanut. It was noted that, every time the bird said "Hello," "the pupils of his eyes contracted and dilated remarkably." This sign is emitted solely in 2 Morris (1979: 48f.) relates an amusing anecdote about a tame animal, a raven, who mistook a highly sensitive portion of the anatomy of the trainer, Konrad Lorenz, for a sample of the strips of meat used in training.</page><page sequence="7">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 95 an emotionally charged situation, for the pupil-size cue may not occur if the bird is talking merely for peanuts; (for kindred observations in domestic cats, see Hess 1975: 116 f.). The second dimension oscillates, in Hediger's words (1938: 243), between "Dressur ohne Affektaufwand" and "Dressur mit bedeutendem Affektaufwand." 3. Two Modes of Animal Training: Apprentissage versus Dressage Some of the searches for primate language capacity clearly constitute strivings toward pure apprentissage; others can more readily be characterized as leaning toward dressage; but most of these projects fall somewhere between these two ideal types of semiosic construction. This is due to both the practical and theoretical constraints upon such investigations. On the practical side, it was found that experimental ape subjects performed poorly if deprived of a congenial social environment. Gill and Rumbaugh report, for example, that During early training we maintained that Lana should have little interaction with the experimenter so that her strict training schedule would not be disputed. We soon found, however, that the social aspect of language training was of great importance. Accordingly we modified our initial decision and began allowing increased social contact between Lana and the experimenters. Lana did much better in an informal social setting with the train- ing procedures modified as needed (in Rumbaugh 1977: 161). Premack, too, describes the "most efficacious training phase" as the one where Sarah's trainer worked inside her cage, sitting on one side of the table with Sarah on an adjacent side (1976: 24). He writes: The whole arrangement was intimate. Sarah's hand could be guided when needed and her head turned gently in a desired direction to assure attention. Astute cajoling often served to stretch out the lesson. Trainers held her hand, patting and encouraging her with affectionate tones. Sometimes she reciprocated, gently chucking the trainer under the chin (ibid.: 25). Sarah was rewarded with tidbits. Although Premack, so far as we know, did not test to see whether Sarah would have performed as well without such material reinforcements, he emphasizes the importance of the rapport between trainer and chimpanzee by supposing that "social approval ... would have pro- ved to be a more potent reward" than the food (ibid. : 27). Trainers, even those educated in the tradition of the experimental tech- nique of apprentissage, also appear to derive a great deal of satisfaction from a close, emotional involvement with their ape charges. It is not uncommon for young apes to elicit parental feelings of attachment in their caretakers, as evidenced in the following passage by Ann Premack, who played an active role in training Sarah, as well as in planning the chimpanzee's overall teaching program : People who raise chimps have high expectations for them as they have for then- own children, and when the chimps don't perform at these levels, the "parents" are often bitter ... Aside from a human baby, I can think of no creature which can arouse stronger feelings of tenderness than an infant chimpanzee. It has huge round eyes and a delicate</page><page sequence="8">96 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 head and is far more alert than a human infant of the same age. When you pick up a young chimp, it encircles your body with its long, trembling arms and legs, and the effect is devastating - you want to take it home! (1976: 16 f.). 3 In contrast to experiments where a chimpanzee being given linguistic training is raised as much as possible as a regular member of a human family (e.g., Hayes 1951; Kellogg and Kellogg 1933; Temerlin 1975), reports of a trai- ner's subjective reactions to his or her ape subject in more recent ape language projects are rare, probably because they are thought to be irrelevant to the scientific aims of training and testing. Since every trainer, even one brought in from the outside for purposes of blind testing, must, if he or she is to work directly with the animal subject, go through usually several "get acquainted" sessions, it would appear that the avoidance to allude to, let alone analyze, such encounters, which seem to be in some ways as fundamental a part of apprentissage as of the more explicitly emotive technique of dressage, is due more to received notions concerning scientific method and apprentissage in general than to the actuality of each case. A more candid expression of these human affective responses, such as that provided by Mrs. Premack, where she describes her earliest associations between herself and Sarah with memories of her child- hood experiences with a retarded sister, and the slow process of accommoda- tion between herself and the chimpanzee, would no doubt furnish a richer pic- ture of the actual circumstances in which humans are pursuing their overt stated goal of apprentissage. Tradition dictates that the ape's "learning" begins only during the next stage - during the first actual training sessions - and that this type of encounter warrants a fuller description than the preceding one, in which trainer and sub- ject first strive to establish a social rapport, i. e., they learn to interpret and respond to one another's signs - come to share, in sum, a common semiosic code - in such a way that mutual understanding will thereafter become possible. As alluded to above, even scholars such as Premack and Rumbaugh, who are careful to achieve as emotion-free a context as possible for their work, admit that "interpersonal" communication of affect is a sine qua non of a successful training or testing session, and yet, strangely, they are quick to deny that the exchange of such information interferes with the attainment of more or less pure apprentissage. The implication is, of course, that communication may be neatly divided into two types - affective and symbolic - and that the two are independent and may be separated one from the other at will. However, speak- ing of ape communication in general (and this would presumably apply as well to intraspecific communication among humans), Marier notes that "[i]t is important not to underestimate the potential richness of the information con- tent of affective signalling" and, further, citing Premack himself, "as long as there is some concordance between the preferences and aversions of communi- 3 The appealing features of infant chimpanzees described by Mrs. Premack are comparable with the releasers of caretaking responses displayed by human babies. See, e. g., Guthrie 1976 and Morris 1977. For additional examples of this type of human respon- se to infant apes, see Desmond 1979.</page><page sequence="9">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 97 cants then a remarkable amount of information can be transmitted by an affective system" (1980: 226). It is ironic that Premack should defend the affective communication system of apes (and presumably humans) and then proceed to more or less ignore the importance of the affective communication taking place between his experimental chimpanzees and their trainers. This is especially puzzling because, in his descriptions of interactions between Sarah and her trainers, there is frequent allusion to the human's emission of nonverbal signs. Describ- ing Sarah's extralinguistic antics, for example, he writes that "[W]hen she miscalculated in her gymnastics and fell 6-8 feet to a concrete floor, she rose without a whimper, often to come over to investigate the grimacing trainer whose face was wreathed in empathetic pain" (Premack 1976: 27; our emphasis). After 16 months of training in the intimate conditions described above, Sarah became sexually mature and sometimes dangerous, so that training had to be carried on through a small door in her cage, human and chimpanzee on oppo- site sides. This arrangement proved less successful than the preceding one. "It was now difficult to pat Sarah and hold her hand, and she rejected far more lessons than she had in the first phase" [ibid. : 28). The emotional commitment of Sarah's trainers to her success is even palpable in the following passage, where Premack is denying that the Clever Hans phenomenon played a part in his project : "There were numerous informal contraindications of social clues, the most vital of which were the clever innovations made by the subjects themselves. These innovations delighted and surprised the trainers, for they were in no way traceable to the training" (ibid. : 29 ; our emphasis). It is reasonable to assume that the emotions of delight and surprise were expressed at least nonverbally in the presence of the chimpan- zees, and could in fact have served as added reinforcing cues. Whether in the Premack project or other similar ones, this sort of personal involvement in the outcome of training and testing could be due to the trainer's relationship to the project itself, as well as to the appealing chimpanzee or gorilla subjects which figure in it. A graduate student, for example, may strive for successful performances as a way of pleasing his employer, the principal investigator, or both himself and his professor, should the former be developing a doctoral thesis from his work with the ape. The principal investigators themselves require success in order to obtain continued financial support for the pro- ject, as well as personal recognition and career advancement. Such behavior is far from uncommon in the academic world, of course. Barber (1976 : 36-44, 60-63) has reviewed a large number of studies documenting cases of intentio- nal fudging of data both by principal investigators, often in intense competi- tion amongst each other for funds and prestige, and by experimenters, who, if they do not have a stake in the research itself, may fail to follow required procedures or fudge data in order to carry out assigned tasks and hand in materials which will be acceptable to the investigator. Whatever the reason, it is immediately clear to an outside visitor to any of the ape "language" projects, or to anyone who talks at length with those involved in them, that the animals are surrounded by a dedicated group of Anthropos 76. 1981 7</page><page sequence="10">98 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 enthusiastic workers, one that constitutes a tightly knit social community with a solid core of shared beliefs and goals in opposition to outside visitors, as well as against groups elsewhere which are competing for scarce research resources. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a skeptic being taken on as a member of such a "team." The fervor of the team members increases with the amount of time which individuals have spent on the project, which, in some cases, now exceeds ten years. The total dedication required for projects of this sort may partially explain why it seems to be the rule rather than the exception that the work becomes a family affair, the principal investigators - husbands and wives (e. g., the Gardners, Premacks, and Rumbaughs) - both becoming deeply involved, with graduate students and, in one case, the sister of the principal investigator, serving as the subjects' uncles and aunts, or members of an extended family. No matter what the sociological and psychological context of the different ape "language" projects, or the degree to which each approaches apprentissage as opposed to dressage, those involved are for the most part unaware of the literature on dressage. How many psychologists, we wonder, have ever even glanced at Hachet-Souplet's eye-opening chapters (1897 : 79-91) on "le dressage du singe," reporting training procedures traceable back to at least the 13th century and reaching a stage of modern sophistication by the 18th (cf. Burroughs 1869 and Pinchbeck 1805) ? This knowledgeable circus buff and onlooker upon its world of wonders puts in doubt even educated monkeys' supposed ability to imitate human movements, and tells us how that illusion is built up by dint of their quadrumanous configuration. Part of the difficulty in properly assessing attempts at apprentissage, such as in the ape "language" projects, or apparently miraculous performances such as talking animals (Sebeok 1979a: Ch. 5, 1979Ò), is that those who are called in to serve as expert judges of such events are usually those trained only in apprentissage, whereas it is precisely the person who is thoroughly familiar with dressage (e. g., Hediger, who is the world's leading expert on the psychology of animals in captivity, especially man-animal communication in zoos and circuses - see 1968, 1969, 1974), or other performance-oriented activities, such as conjury (e. g., Christo- pher 1970; Randi 1975), or a combination of scientific methodology and conjury (e. g., see Diaconis 1978; Gardner 1957, 1966) who are best able to detect the operation of subtle affective cues - whether unwitting and therefore self -decep- tive, or aimed at misleading others -in a supposedly "controlled," emotion-free laboratory experiment. 4. Great Expectations All of the ape "language" studies fall into the eighth category of man- animal interactions, or man training animal, in which, however, further far- reaching distinctions must now be introduced. Two variables of direct concern in the present context are: the performance intended to be induced and the organism selected for the training. As for the former, the class of behaviors most particularly to the point are those involving attempts to humanize an animal, that is, to attribute to it hominine traits, indeed, "to endow the animal</page><page sequence="11">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 99 with psychical capabilities like those of men, and to say that it acts from similar motives" (Katz 1937: 19). This trend of thought, associated, among others, with the romantic indulgences of the school of Romanes, and known, of course, as anthropomorphism, was recently adverted to by Griffin (1976 : 68-71), who, particularly in reference to nonverbal communication, suggests "that it is more likely than not that thoughts or mental experiences in people and animals share important properties without being completely identical" (p. 70). Griffin cautions "that enthusiastic observers of animals are constantly in danger of interpreting their behavior in more complex terms than is necessary or correct" (p. 72), and proffers the Clever Hans effect as "an outstanding example" (ibid.). More recently, the special issue of The Behavioral and Brain Sciences devoted to "Cognition and Consciousness in Nonhuman Species" and featuring articles by Griffin (1978a), Premack and Woodruff (1978), and Savage-Rum- baugh, Rumbaugh, and Boysen (the latter reprinted in 1980), plus a lengthy section of commentaries by a wide range of discussants, brings this problem sharply into focus, especially from the perspective of input from projects designed to teach apes language-like skills to the establishment of a cognitive ethology. Nowhere is the matter of anthropomorphic tendencies among ape "language" researchers more thoroughly or more cogently discussed than in Desmond (1979), where the problem is traced back to the earlier primate expe- riments and observations which gave rise to modern approaches. Several separate but intertwined issues appear to be at stake here - name- ly, the risk that the beliefs, aspirations, and expectations of investigators and experimenters will lead to (1) inaccurate observations and/or recordings of ape behaviors; (2) the overinterpretation of ape performances; or (3) the uninten- ded modification of an animal's behavior in the direction of the desired results. It is to these subjects that the following sections of this paper are devoted. 5. Observational and Recording Errors The first of these issues is especially important for the analysis of projects attempting to teach apes the American Sign Language of the deaf (ASL), since their methods of observation and informal testing were such that it was unclear exactly what should be counted and recorded, in which case, as several studies have shown (see Barber 1976: 74 f.), experimenters' expectancies can affect how they interpret or score responses of their subjects. But this issue is certainly relevant as well to researches using artificial symbol systems. Barber (ibid.: 57-59), in fact, reviewing studies which show that experimenters not infre- quently make errors in recording events, and that these mistakes are generally in the direction of the experimenters' expectations or desires, illustrates the relevance of this particular type of pitfall to any experimental procedure (cf. Rosenthal 1978). Beginning with the seminal work of the Gardners with the chimpanzee Washoe, all subsequent ASL research with either chimpanzees - i. e., that led by Fouts, in Oklahoma, and by Terrace and Bever, in New York - or with gorillas - i. e., the work by Patterson in Palo Alto - has been open to question</page><page sequence="12">100 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 as to the accuracy of observations made of spontaneous signing by ape subjects in more or less informal, conversational settings. The Gardners report (1980a : 300) that both in their original work with Washoe and with later subjects (Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar), the criterion of reliability of reporting sign acquisi- tion was that a sign be reported on three independent occasions by three diffe- rent observers, at which point it is listed as an acquired sign. Such a sign was counted as a "reliable item of vocabulary" only when, in addition, it had been noted to occur "spontaneously" and "appropriately" at least once on each of 15 consecutive days. The Gardners claim that these are much more stringent criteria than those used by students of language acquisition by children, e. g., by asking the mother to list new words - a technique, by the way, no longer favored in modern child language studies - or by taking random samples of a child's speech on different occasions. However, such comparisons are not altogether appropriate. In contrast with the situation of a mother with her language-learning child, for example, the assistants teaching the chimpanzees are brought into contact with the animals for the sole purpose of inculcating in them certain carefully programmed communication skills. They are thus more narrowly and intensely focused on a restricted range of the learner's behavior than is a mother in a home setting. In addition, they have frequent discussions with one another and with project leaders about signs they believe they have seen, doubtless even reading one another's notes and research diaries. Utilizing such a method - and this procedure was followed also by Fouts, Patterson, and Terrace - one observer may prime another to inadvertently create situations in which a newly reported sign might be likely to recur by, for example, using a certain tool when the sign for that object has been reported by another observer. This outcome is especially likely owing to the fact that trainers were instructed by the Gard- ners to record the context in which a new sign was observed as well as the sign itself. Should the ape actually produce a sign in this sort of context, it would not be considered the result of outright prompting, molding, or the Clever Hans effect, all of which the Gardners deny played a role in the reporting of new signs, and yet such innocent provision of opportunities for corroboration of other observers' records would certainly influence the overall course of the study. Other methods employed in the ape ASL projects make such distortions even more likely. To take the Gardners' project as an example, "old" signs were, first of all, continually reassessed to see if they had become a permanent part of the chimpanzee's repertory. Reassessment consisted of deliberately introducing the appropriate context for signs in the chimpanzee's vocabulary which had not yet appeared spontaneously during the day. New signs which had not yet met the criterion were elicited, for example, by presenting a picture of a cow, since it would be unlikely that the chimpanzees would see a real one 15 days in a row, and, finally, new signs were taught through promp- ting and molding. A second weakness in the reporting procedures in this type of enterprise is that a trainer may, after conferring with his colleagues about new signs, simply be more prone than he would have been to interpret a certain gesture</page><page sequence="13">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 101 on the part of the ape as the new sign reported yesterday by someone else. If a sign has come up in conversation, it is only to be expected that this knowledge will predispose observers to interpret any gesture which remotely resembles that sign configuration as the sign itself, in the manner of a pars pro toto. Thus Clifford and Bull (1978: 161) have shown that, when a group of witnesses gets together to reconstruct an event, it may produce a more complete account of details, but "at the cost of increased inaccuracy with groups obtaining 40 per cent more errors of commission than individuals. ... Group interactions may pressure witnesses into offering inferences rather than perceptions, or even into préfabrications." It is thus misleading to emphasize either the independence of observations or the spontaneity of the apes' performances, since the actual working conditions of such projects considerably reduce both such elements (on this point cf. Ristau and Robbins 1979: 291). That reports of ape signs may be incorrect is even more likely when one considers that trainers were commonly asked to keep daily diaries, for which they had to rely on their memory of sign exchanges occurring while many other events competed for their attention. Anyone who has ever attempted to recon- struct a dialogue which took place even a few minutes before knows how diffi- cult a task this is, even if one only tries to capture the basic form of each utter- ance, ignoring all the paralinguistic and nonverbal elements which infused and surrounded it. 4 There are several other methodological considerations which cast further doubt upon the objectivity of the recordkeeping procedures involving signing apes. The Gardners report that, as their subjects matured and the frequency of signs increased, maintaining a complete inventory of signs and contextual descriptions became impossible. "Often," they write, "the brisk pace of an extended conversational interchange precludes verbatim recording." It thus became necessary to employ a different method of recording, whereby, during a specified period, "everything signed by the chimpanzee," as well as contextual descriptions, were recorded. These sign protocols required a team of two persons, one whispering an immediate spoken transcription of signing, together with notes about context, into a tape recorder, the other "performing the usual role of teacher, caretaker, playmate, and interlocutor" (1980a: 311). The Gardners patterned this method after the work of Roger Brown and his colleagues with language-learning children, but in so doing overlooked the critical difference between the medium of communication being studied in each case. The majority 4 See Clifford and Bull 1978 for a full review of the many linguistic and cognitive factors which influence the perceptions and memory of eyewitnesses, often leading to inaccurate accounts of events. The material they present fully supports C. S. Peirce's theory of the logical nature of perception and hypothesis (see Sebeok and Umiker-Sebeok 1979a). In light of the immense amount of evidence brought forward by Clifford and Bull, among others, persons attempting to teach language-like skills to apes would do well to heed the warning, given those involved in juridical proceedings, about the danger of accepting the fictions of the law court - namely, that eyewitnesses see and hear correctly and so testify, and that, if they do not testify with accuracy, cross-examination will straighten them out.</page><page sequence="14">102 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 of the assistants working with signing apes are native speakers of English, having learned ASL only for limited use during their participation in the pro- ject. These observers are thus placed in a situation where they must transform one sign system, ASL, which is for them a secondary form of communication, into another speech, which requires not a simple translation within a single channel, but an entire transmutation from the visual to the acoustic mode. It seems reasonable to conclude that there would be a far greater rate of misinter- pretations in this type of situation than even in one where a speaker of, say, English, were called upon to make a simultaneous translation of the utterances made by a language-learning child in a spoken language - say, Hungarian - in which that observer is not fluent ! The simultaneous recording of children's speech, even when in one's own native linguistic code, is itself difficult, especially when undertaken within the rapid, noise-filled context of a young child's living quarters. Errors are easily introduced at every stage of the process - from the original observations to the final transcription of the tape itself. It is puzzling that critics of the ASL ape projects have overlooked this fundamental shortcoming of this method of data collection. Despite the not inconsiderable number of sources of misjudge- ment, they seem to take for granted the reliability of observers, based largely, one would assume, on their trust in the spot checks made by so-called expert witnesses who are proficient in ASL and who testify that they have in fact observed the apes making what they took to be genuine ASL signs. We shall return to the question of the reliability of such expert testimony below. Further possible sources of error can be uncovered if one imagines what kind of communication could be taking place between the pair of humans involved in such team recording sessions as described above. Reports indicate that trainers and observers enter these situations with the tacit understanding that it is the chimpanzee's, not one another's, behavior that is of interest. But surely at least some of the comments of the recorder will be heard by the ape's interlocutor, thus inevitably altering the latter's own interpretations of the ape's signs and in this way influencing the direction the human-ape conversation may take. If the session is to yield usable data, the ape's inter- locutor must make sure that signs are visible to the recorder, and this, coupled with the feedback produced by overhearing a slightly delayed interpretation of the ongoing interaction, and the knowledge that one is performing for an audience, cannot help but make sign exchanges less than completely sponta- neous. The construction of reality in such situations would involve communi- cation among all three of the participants, in complex two-directional forms between both humans and between each human and the ape. By observing the human interlocutor's reactions to the ape's behavior, the reporter is as much cued to the meaning of the exchange as by watching the chimpanzee's performance, just as the human interlocutor is influenced by the spoken interpretation of the interaction by the reporter. 5 5 This type of situation presents an interesting combination of eristic and heuristic dialogue (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca 1969 : 39) : (1) two of the participants, the trainer</page><page sequence="15">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 103 This is not to say that some researchers have not been aware of the springes mentioned above. Terrace and his colleagues, for example, have attempted to check the reliability of their trainers' observations of Nim's signs by having outside observers, some of them, unlike the students, fluent in ASL, witness sessions between the chimpanzee and one of his trainers, and then compare the two resulting accounts of each involved. They state (n. d. : 13) that agreement between the teachers' reports and the transcripts of independent observers was between 77 % and 94 %. This sounds impressive until one reads, in a footnote, that these levels of agreement were attained only following discussions between the teacher and "independent" observer, during which they attempted to determine whether particular hand movements of Nim's were in fact ASL signs, as against gestures or approximations of signs. The two human participants, in other words, renegotiated the reality of the events in question, leaving us to wonder how much the figures quoted represent what communication took place between the chimpanzee and the teacher, as opposed to what transpired between the two observers. This sort of communication might be compared with discussions which take place between a mother and a stranger concerning the meaning of the utterance of the former's child. The influence of linguistic interpretations over perceptions works in both directions, especially if the stranger is an "authority" on language acquisition, child psychology, or the like. The extent to which students of language acquisition bias a mother regarding her own child's linguistic performances remains unexplored. The honesty of Terrace and his colleagues in reporting this and other procedural steps which others, we suspect, omit from their accounts, is to be applauded. It makes it possible for the reader to assess more accurately the reliability and import of the data presented (see, however, Terrace et al. 1979: note 25). To continue with the example of the use of independent observers of Nim's sign behavior, other questions come to mind concerning the collection of data itself, prior to their evaluation. Nim's classroom consisted of a bare, 8'-square room, one wall of which contained a large one-way mirror, beneath which there was a portal used for photographing and videotaping the chimpan- zee's behavior. The independent observer sat in an adjacent room, viewing the chimpanzee and the teacher through the one-way mirror. This situation did not preclude the possibility that the observer, assuming that he was not deaf (of which we are not informed), could hear the teacher's spoken account of the interaction and thus receive acoustic as well as visual cues from the latter con- cerning the meaning of Nim's gestures. We are not told that sound could not transude from the classroom to the observation room, although this seems all the more probable in view of the existence of the portal and the fact that, in order to assure proper recordings of the teacher's and observer's spoken commentaries, all possible sources of noise in the acoustic channel had probably and the ape, communicate directly with one another, as specific individuals; (2) two of the participants communicate with the third person, the observer, only indirectly, through one another; and (3) all three actors address a "universal" audience - that is, the reader/ viewer of a written or filmed record of their interaction.</page><page sequence="16">104 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 been eliminated. In any case, this one example exposes a few among the many conceivable flaws in the laudable plan to introduce "independent" observers in order to check the reliability of project personnel. Laura Petitto and Mark Seidenberg, members of the Columbia Project Nim headed by Terrace, trace, in a pair of articles published in 1979, observa- tional and recording errors in the Fouts, Patterson, and Gardner projects to investigators' and experimenters' ignorance of three crucial things : the natural gestures of apes, the structure of ASL, and the methodology of studies of first language acquisition. Ape researchers, they point out, have not distinguished between the natural nonverbal signs common to apes, both wild and tame, and those which are learned in the course of specific training procedures. Instead, all of the apes' communicative behaviors (and some non-communicative ones as well, e. g., scratching) are together classified as 'signs'. This generic use of the term 'sign' with reference to a diverse group of behaviors contributes to uncertainty over the inter- pretation of their activities (Seidenberg and Petitto 1979: 195). Each ape's vocabulary includes signs such as pick (signed by picking a part of their anatomy), hug (signed by hugging), tickle (signed by tickling), kiss (signed by kissing), scratch (signed by scratching), and others. The term "sign" is, in fact, inappropriate since, in contrast to signs, these behaviors do not stand for or represent any referent; they are simply activities exhibited by wild apes ... In the sign language projects ... they are glossed as lexical items, with attendant linguistic implications. Estimates of the size of the apes' vocabularies are inflated when such activities are glossed as 'signs'. These behaviors can be termed 'linguistic' only under a definition so broad that it would fail to distinguish between human language and the behaviors of many lower animals (Petitto and Seiden- bergl979: 170-171). Once again, we see the results of scientific investigators failing to take into account the natural behavior of their experimental animals, mistaking species-typical reactions to humans for learned responses. Another example of this fundamental error so common to research in instrumental conditioning is provided by Moore and Stuttard (1979), who demonstrate that "the principal reactions [of domestic cats] described in Guthrie and Horton's classic learning monograph [1946] appear to have been caused by the mere presence of the experimenters" (1979: 1031). Contrary to the claims of Guthrie and Horton, "neither escape nor food reinforcement is necessary for the establishment of such responses. They are species-typical 'greeting' reactions, readily elicited by the sight of human observers" (ibid.). 6 The apes' natural behaviors, glossed by experimenters as ASL signs, did not resemble the highly stylized ASL signs, according to Seidenberg and Petitto, and "the exact configurations of elements which characterize ASL signs are not 6 In a hilarious response to a series of four photographs of Nim, his trainer, and Nim's pet cat in Terrace et al. (1979: 892), Musicant et al., with tongue in cheek, reproach Terrace and his colleagues for failing to note "the fluent signing being made by the cat ... in Kitty Sign Language (KSL)" (1980: 258). As they point out, on close examination of the photographs, the cat appears to be signing, in sequence, "lemme," "outa," "here," followed by "dirty," "well known to fans of Washoe as an all-purpose expletive" (ibid.). "The most significant aspect of the frothing feline's utterances," they continue, "is that she is accomplishing all of this without prompting, unlike Nim" (ibid.).</page><page sequence="17">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 105 observed in the gestures of apes" (1979: 196; cf. Petitto and Seidenberg 1979: 171). "Evidence concerning the structures and/or expressive devices common to the apes' behavior and to signing in ASL is superficial at best," and it is, in fact, "highly questionable whether Washoe or Koko were taught ASL at all" (Seidenberg and Petitto 1979: 208). Rather, the apes were taught individual vocabulary signs, some taken directly from ASL, some reduced from ASL signs, and some invented for the ape; these were signed largely in English word order. Since neither the apes nor their teachers used the appro- priate grammatical structure or expressive devices, their signing was not ASL; since they did not use grammatical morphemes (e. g., -ing, -ed, -ly) or function words (e. g., a, the, are) they were not following Signed English. The language model in each project was a pidgin sign. In light of these facts, it is misleading to term their behavior signing in ASL (ibid.). The apes' behaviors were described exclusively in terms of hand configu- rations, while in true ASL signs are defined along several dimensions simultane- ously. The apes failed to learn to use these other expressive devices even after years of training, while deaf children pick them up easily, as a matter of course, and use them even in their early utterances. Other primary signalling devices of ASL, such as eye gaze and facial expressions, were also not employed by the apes {ibid.: 209). A number of techniques has been developed by students of language acquisition in hearing and deaf children which could have been employed by the ape language researchers working with ASL but were not. In fact, many of the methods of observing and testing ape sign acquisition fall prey to precisely those problems of interpretation which stimulated the creation of new methods for studying human language development. "The ape researchers," Seidenberg and Petitto show, "frequently demonstrate unfamiliarity with the basic methodology of language acquisition research" (1979: 206). We have, one must conclude, teams of researchers trying to teach animals, whose natural behavior they do not understand except in a very restricted context, a sign system they themselves know very little about, using methods which are not suited to the task. This is, however, only the beginning of the story. 6. Ockham's Razor The second issue at stake here is the methodological principle of economy of explanation, commonly known as "Ockham's razor," which is invoked in several alternative formulations of the influential 14th century philosopher, as : "What can be done with fewer assumptions is done in vain with more." The principal justification for parsimony is the elimination of pseudo-explanatory entities. Criteria for judgment in accounting for any fact, according to Ockham, must derive either from manifest experience (the empiricist criterion of evi- dence) or from compelling reasoning. Probably the most common form of criticism leveled by one ape "langua- ge" investigator against another is that simpler, more parsimonious explana- tions are available to account for a rival's data, whether or not they were gathe- red through participant observation method or forced-choice testing.

Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 ting on the Gardners' use of spontaneous productions to judge knowledge of language, Lenneberg (1980a: 81) warns that all of Washoe's spontaneous signs should be disregarded for purposes of assessing her linguistic competence, not only because of the peril of the Clever Hans effect, but also because, in our attempts to determine the appropriateness of such messages, "we are simply testing our own ingenuity to assign interpretations to productions that might, for all we know, have been emitted randomly. It would always be possible to claim that the ape had 'intended* to tell us something. " Illustrating the prin- ciple that the simple concatenation of signs by an animal may be the result of random generation rather than the early application of rules of syntax, Lenneberg provides the following amusing thought experiment : Suppose a mathematician wishes to teach an animal a simple arithmetic language consisting of four symbols only. He finds that if he says "three," the animal responds "one, two." He interprets this as a primitive but essentially appropriate and correct combination of words by imputing to the animal the intention of wanting to say "one and two (is three) ." Soon he discovers that when he says "two" the animal again says "one, two," which delights him; now he has proved that the animal has learned multiplication. When the animal hears "one," it again says "one, two," which, of course, can mean nothing else but that it has caught on to subtraction. And when it says "one, two" upon presentation of "zero" his trainer finally has evidence that the animal has spontaneously learned to do addition with the residue class modulo three ! The mathematician may, of course, be correct ; but then again, the animal may be responding randomly. The combining of words is of interest only if we can demonstrate the particular type of relationship upon which the combination is based (19806: 128). Overly rich interpretations of chimpanzee and gorilla gestures abound in the published reports. Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues (1980: 375) have repeatedly argued that, given the weak acquisition criteria employed by those working with signing apes - namely, the ability to name pictures or to produce an iconic gesture repeatedly, under the same or similar circumstances - "it is impossible to tell whether the chimpanzee is simply imitating or echoing, in a performative sense, the action or object, or whether the animal is indeed at- tempting to relay a message." Since, as they further allege, ASL is a highly iconic system of communication, they conclude that there is nothing to prevent us saying parsimoniously that the apes are merely producing "short-circuited iconic sequences." Unless it can be shown, they go on to say, that the ape could competently use a sign apart from the original context in which it was acquired (i. e., in a situation where the actions and signs of the trainer cannot remind the animal of the hand movements used in the sign), the mere announcement that signs occurred in "new contexts" is not sufficient to rule out the possibility that the animal's behavior can be accounted for by the simpler explanations of deferred imitation or error interpreted in a novel manner by the experimenters. The records kept on Washoe, according to Premack, were meant to preserve sense or meaning rather than word order, and, as such, "reflect dispositions of the recording organisms no less than of the organism recorded" (Premack 1976 : 331) . 7 7 On the Rumbaughs' own use of richly interpreted anecdotes in their work with Lana and other chimpanzees, see Mellgren and Fouts 1978 and Schubert 1978.</page><page sequence="19">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 107 Seidenberg and Petitto (1979 : 195-200) note that a large proportion of ape "signing" behavior involves indexical and iconic - that is, non-arbitrary - elements. Some of these motivated gestures are, it is true, a part of the ASL used by human signers, but, in contrast with humans, the apes fail to utilize such information within the larger complex, conventional system of ASL. If, in fact, a large proportion of the signs are gestural, possibly modifying or exten- ding the apes' natural system of gestures, then the possibility that the remaining signs were learned in a rote fashion and signed using non-linguistic responding strategies increa- ses. We should note that if our interpretations are correct, it is misleading to describe this behavior as "signing," since this term suggests a level of abstraction that is largely absent. Nor is pantomime the correct term, since the apes' behaviors are time-locked to on-going activities, unlike true pantomime ... Nim, Washoe, Koko, and other signing pongids show evidence of having learned a "standardized system of gestures." Although modern language may have evolved from such gestural systems ..., these gestures do not exhibit critical features of human languages (ibid. : 200) . Much has been made of various experimental apes1 so-called "innova- tions," several examples of which - including generalizations of signs and con- struction of new lexical items - are provided by Gardner (1980), Hill (1980), and others. Unfortunately, these instances are generally reported in such a way that not enough is learned of the context of occurrence to enable us to rule out the possibility of either trainer suggestion or overinterpretation. Terrace and his associates (1979: 895; cf. Terrace 1979; Sebeok and Umiker-Sebeok 19796), for example, note that there is available a more parsimonious explanation for Fouts' report that Washoe was creating a new compound lexical item when she produced water plus bird in the presence of a swan when asked what that} Since Fouts provides no evidence that Washoe characterized the swan as a "bird that inhabits water," we may just as well assume that the chimpanzee, who was very familiar with the question form what that?, was merely responding by first identifying a body of water, then a bird (cf. Martin Gardner's comment on this example, cited in Sebeok 1979c: 57 f.). Seidenberg and Petitto (1979 : 181-183), discussing the sampling problems of the Gardner, Fouts, and Patterson projects, conclude that, without the publication of large corpora of ape utterances, there is no solid evidence in support of interpreting anecdotal reports of behaviors, such as Patterson's description (19786: 88) of Koko's signing Cookie Rock for a stale sweet roll, as proof of an ape's ability to create novel sign forms. This problem is seen most clearly with respect to the anecdotes that are frequently cited (e. g., water bird). In the absence of a corpus, one cannot determine whether such sequences were synthesized through the application of linguistic rules, or merely the result of the ape acting as a random sign generator which happened to emit some interesting- looking strings. The water bird example loses much of its force if the ape also combined each of these signs with a large number of other signs (e. g., water shoe, water banana, cookie bird, etc.). This alternative is not implausible. As the Terrace et al. (1980) corpus indicates, their subject ... combined signs into a very large number of permutations, most of which occurred with low frequency. Some of the resulting combinations are fortuitous, others are not. While even the most bizarre combinations could ... be interpreted metaphorically, it is simpler to assume that they occurred as the result of random pairings of signs or other non-linguistic combinatorial processes . . . (ibid. : 182 ; cf. Petitto and Seidenberg 1979 : 163 f.) .</page><page sequence="20">108 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 If a sign or other response produced by an ape appears to be inapprop- riate, to take a second type of example, human trainers appear all too willing to stretch their imagination in order to make the animal's performance "fit" conversationally, reminding us of the clever interpretations made of the so- called telepathically-communicated images drawn by such allegedly psychic persons as Uri Geller, where gullible observers, wishing to believe in his extra- ordinary powers, eagerly project their own concept onto the sometimes ama- zingly crude but suggestive scribbles made by the performer (Randi 1975; cf. Randi 1978). Thus anomalous chimpanzee or gorilla signs may be read as jokes, insults, metaphors, or the like, much as the "not infrequent offenses against the very elements of counting and the fundamental arithmetical pro- cesses" made by Clever Hans "were regarded in part as intentional jokes and by an authority in pedagogy as a 'sign of independence and stubbornness which might also be called humor'" (Pfungst 1965: 145). Patterson (1978a: 456) reports that Koko seems to relish the effects of her practical jokes, often responding exactly opposite to what I ask her to do. One day, during a videotaping session, I asked Koko to place a toy animal under a bag, and she responded by taking the toy and stretching to hold it up to the ceiling. Or, to take another example from the same source, it was interpreted as a deliberate joke (the gorilla was "grinning") when Koko, in response to persis- tent attempts to get her to sign "drink," made "a perfect drink sign - in her ear." How, one wonders, did the observer know that, of all the hand locations and facial expressions occurring during that session, this particular combina- tion alone was significant (see Sebeok 1979a : Ch. 5) ? Examples of such over- interpretation are found scattered throughout the literature on signing apes, both in articles which are laudatory (e. g., Linden 1980) and those critical of such antics (e. g., Gardner 1980). While accepting that the sign play of apes is genuine, Hill nevertheless comments (1980: 341) that there remain serious questions about whether their [the apes'] metaphorical abilities are truly linguistic ... No matter how suggestive is the circumstantial evidence, the seman- tics of the chimpanzees' symbol systems cannot be said to be the same as the semantics of the signs into which they 'translate', since the system is so truncated. 8 Premack (1976: 29) claims that Sarah's symbolic innovations were the "most vital" type of informal evidence that the animal's performances in general were not the result of social cuing. The examples which he provides (ibid.: 30), however, are all ambiguous, based on a trainer's hunch about what the chimpanzee meant by a deviation from the regular trained responses. The determination of trainers to show their animal in the best light has even led to the denial that errors are mistakes, again bringing to mind one of the assumptions which sets research on psychic phenomena apart from normal 8 Cf. Lenneberg (1980a) regarding the difficulty in telling whether Washoe is making metaphors or mistakes.</page><page sequence="21">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 109 scientific procedures. A so-called psychic's mistakes on tests of his powers are frequently used to prove that those powers are real, based on the assumption that, if the performer were using mere tricks, he would be correct every time, while his occasional mistakes prove that his correct responses are based not on conjury but a special yet unpredictable "force." "Thus," as Randi (1975: 11) points out, "the performer who can consistently turn out effects that defy explanation by ordinary means is considered a fraud, and the one who 'hits and misses' or who has periods of impotency is judged to be the real goods." Turning to the chimpanzee experiments, we find Premack (1976: 30 f.) using Sarah's mistakes on matching sets with more than five items as proof that Sarah was not responding to social cues. He argues that, since the chimpanzee had done well on matching sets which did not involve numerosity, the trainer would expect her to do as well on those that did, and thus would be likely to cue her toward success. This, however, is a mighty assumption. It is at least as likely that the trainer would reasonably doubt that a chimpanzee could handle so many items at once, despite her earlier performances. As far as we can tell, Premack never tried to determine what the trainer actually expected or did in the training situation. Ristau and Robbins have noted that examples of gratuitous interpreta- tions of conversational exchanges with Lana are also common. [A]t times the interpretations of Lana's productions [Chs. 9 and 12 of Rumbaugh 1977] involve assumptions about reasons for her errors that either the authors cannot possibly know or that rely on information that the authors have not offered the reader. For example, they cite an error as the 'result of Lana not attending to the question posed,' giving no indication of what clues led them to this conclusion (p. 243) (1979: 270). In another example (Rumbaugh 1977: 243 f.), of two seemingly irrelevant contributions by Lana to a conversation, one is simply ignored, the other excu- sed, without evidence, as a "typing error" (Ristau and Robbins 1979: 271). Another example of a chimpanzee being in a "no-forfeit" situation is again provided by Premack (1976: 31 f.). He notes that Sarah had difficulty learning the concepts "is," "if-then," and the quantifiers "all," "none," "one," etc. He assumed that, "If social cues were the basis of Sarah's learning, she should have had no more difficulty learning complex predicates than simple ones" (p. 31). The logic of this argument is difficult to follow. According to his training procedures, complex predicates were broken down into simpler parts, so that Sarah had to go through more preliminary training sets to reach the full form. Yet, he says, because the difficulty of each step is about the same (his reason for breaking difficult patterns down), the animal should make no greater number of errors learning a complex pattern than a simple one. But it would seem that the very fact that there were more steps involved would mean a greater number of errors, even if the chimpanzee performed about as reliably on each step as when learning a simple predicate. Premack further confuses the issue by saying that Sarah's difficulty on some of the complex forms was his fault, not hers, since he did not break the form down properly. The danger of overinterpretation of an ape's signing or use of artificial symbols is thus present even when the method of testing controls the input to</page><page sequence="22">110 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A.

On the level of the single lexical item, Premack (1976 : 36) claims that all that the Gardners' double-blind vocabulary tests - also employed by Fouts and Patterson - have shown is that Washoe "learned to associate diffe- rent responses with different objects," and that, "In view of the chimpanzee's capacity ... is there any serious reason to doubt that it can learn to associate different responses with different objects?" Likewise, Rumbaugh (1980: 242) criticizes the Gardners' testing procedure, saying that it did not provide for a way to determine the degree to which Washoe's signs were essentially generalized responses to stimuli similar to those used in prior training. Her competence in the use of her signs syntactically in order to generate and transmit truly novel messages, information, or requests was not tapped by this or any other test. Instan- ces of her using signs in these ways were reported separately; however, they may have been fortuitous productions. The execution of a specific behavior, such as a hand sign, in the presence of particular objects is not adequate evidence of naming ability. It is quite plausible to assume that even pigeons have this ability. Herrnstein, Loveland, and Cable (1977) have shown that pigeons can give the appearance of having learned simple concepts (e. g., discriminate pictures of trees from pictures of other objects). It would be trivial to teach them to pair the pecking of a particular colored light with the presentation of a picture of a tree. They would then be said to "name" the picture ... Furthermore, the ability of Herrnstein et al.' s pigeons to discriminate trees from other objects extended to literally thousands of exemplars. Hence, they possess the capacity to "name" a potentially infinite class of objects (Petitto and Seidenberg 1979: 169). Tests of Washoe's comprehension of multi-sign sequences have also been criticized from the point of view that in most cases non-syntactic or nonlin- guistic explanations are readily available to account for the chimpanzee's responses. Terrace et al. (n. d. : 62), for example, note that the Gardners accep- ted as correct any response to a wh-question which they thought was lexically appropriate, so that, for example, if Washoe signed "blue" in response to the question "what color?" when the object being used was a red ball, her answer was counted as correct because it was a color. Washoe clearly learned to respond to such category questions by producing a response which fell within the correct category, but many of her specific responses were inappropriate. Washoe's response to a question was scored as correct if it contained a sign from a predesignated target category. For example, the question what's that took a noun response; the question where' s that took a locative, etc. Washoe's vocabulary signs were grouped into grammatical categories for scoring purposes; the sign glossed as listen, for example, was scored as a noun. The presumed meanings of her signs were ignored. Thus, if the Gardners held a ball in front of Washoe and asked her what's that? the response listen come would be scored as correct because it contains listen (Seidenberg and Petitto 1979: 204). Washoe could have answered a question simply "by learning to associate a single target sign with a wh-sign; since meaning was irrelevant, she could use this sign in any context where the discriminitive stimulus (wh-sign) occurred" (ibid.). Certainly, as Terrace and his collaborators maintain, such responses cannot be used to show, as the Gardners claim, that Washoe's performance at the time was comparable to that of the human child at Stage III in Brown's scheme of language development (see Brown 1968).</page><page sequence="23">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 111 Even when Washoe's responses to wh-questions were appropriate, Rumbaugh (1980: 244) wonders whether this level of mastery constitutes "grammatical" control, for grammar subsumes word-order effects. The constituents of Washoe's responses to the wh-questions (e. g., Q. 'Who you?' A. 'Linn', Q. 'Whose that?' A. 'Shoes you'; Q. 'Where we go?' A. 'You me out') were by and large appropriate, but the report [Gardner and Gardner 1975] and its analyses did not address questions regarding the logic inherent in the organization of responses that entailed move than one word - a relevant issue in the evaluation of "grammatical control." For one reason or another, investigators appear to find it difficult to avoid the use of tests in which the animal subject can rely upon nonlinguistic strategies to accomplish a task in a way which is considered correct. Take, for example, the experiment designed by Fouts and his colleagues to test the ability of Ally, a young male chimpanzee, to comprehend novel commands. Ally was first taught to pick, on command, one of five objects out of a box and to put it in one of three locations (i. e., put the baby in the purse). After Ally had learned the procedure, new items were placed in the box, and in addition, a new location was added in which to place the items (see Fouts et al. 1979: 301). To prevent cuing, a screen was placed between the experimenter and the locations in which the item was to be placed. Ally scored 40 percent correct for total commands, with a chance level of responding being approximately 7 per- cent. At closer look, however, one wonders what such results actually mean. Since the sentence frame, "Put x in y," did not vary, only the object (slot x filler) and the location (slot y filler) elements were not redundant. All Ally had to do was to recall his prior associations between a restricted number of signs and their objects, and perform the general task, learned in the training phase of the experiment, of placing the object in the designated place. The order, object plus place, was maintained throughout the test, so that Ally would know from this nonlinguistic cue that (1) the first nonredundant element was some- thing in the box, and (2) it was to be moved toward the second nonredundant element in the string of signs. At most, then, this test was one of Ally's ability to name, not his knowledge of sentence structure. Compare the similar analysis, made by Terrace and Bever (1980: 183 f.), of Sarah's alleged sensitivity to the sentence structure of apparently more complex sequences such as "Sarah insert banana pail apple dish." A number of kindred attacks have been made on Premack's interpre- tations of Sarah's use of language tokens in forced-choice tests. After analyzing his treatment of Sarah's training with "name of" concept, for example, the Gardners (1980a: 316) conclude that "Since Sarah's program of training and testing concentrated on each 'linguistic concept' for days and weeks at a time, she could have solved Premack's entire battery of problems by rote memory alone." Savage-Rumbaugh and her associates (1980: 379) also affirm that some of Sarah's performances - notably the match-to-sample paradigm tests designed to demonstrate Sarah's symbolic representational capacity - could be accounted for on the basis of simple recall, their own experimental chimpanzee, Lana, having performed much more difficult recall problems. "Questions as to whether</page><page sequence="24">112 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 or not such a [symbolic] capacity is necessary to solve the various problems could and should be raised for the entire gamut of tests presented to Sarah," they write (ibid.). They agree with Mounin (1980: 174) that "the suspicion lingers" that only an illusion of language is created by the translation of Sarah's token sequences into English, while, stripped of this linguistic surface, the animal's behavior could reasonably be explained in terms of simple response- reward associations which have little to do with linguistic competence. One of the reasons Pfungst (1965 : 227) concluded that Mr. von Osten, the owner of Clever Hans, was not deceiving the public was that von Osten's training tech- nique, which the horse's master thought of as "instruction," took much longer to accomplish than would have a straightforward stimulus-response training, without the illusion of intervening mathematical or linguistic concepts. For years, Mr. von Osten "taught" Hans as one might a high school student, and it was this aspect of the Clever Hans story which both sets it apart from earlier examples of counting pigs, dogs, horses, and other animals - going back to at least the time of Justinian (Timaeus 1974: 146 f.) - and makes it particularly relevant to modern ape sign language studies. Pfungst recognized that Mr. von Osten's training procedures were not what was then known as classical condi- tioning, but rather came only much later (1928) to be called instrumental conditioning (ibid.). Terrace has, in fact, applied the law of parsimony to a large number of Premack's testing procedures, and, in each case, "The homogeneous nature of the questions posed during any one session, along with the restricted range of possible answers, increases the likelihood that nonlinguistic contextual cues contributed to the performance of Premack's subjects" (1980Ô : 392). Sometimes, as he shows, it was even possible for the experimental animals to solve a prob- lem without knowing the critical word involved. Simple discrimination learning and memory could account for many of Sarah's responses which hitherto have been cited by Premack as examples of knowledge of sentence structure, communicative intent, pronouns, prepositions, and predicates. For example, Premack (1976 : 32) argues that Sarah was responding to sentential complexity rather than nonlinguistic factors of a certain test because, for one thing, she took longer to handle the complex sentences than simple ones presented (although length of time was not recorded - this was just Premack's impression, it seems), and she would do a smaller number of the former in any given training session. This might be said to prove, rather, that Sarah was solving problems on the basis of memory and that it took her longer to remember more training associa- tions for tests involving complex sentences, since she had to go through a greater number of training steps for these. Terrace and Bever (1980: 185), noting that the Lana project's use of a computer provided Lana with access to a much larger set of alternative symbols than did Premack's, nevertheless point out that Lana was also trained in long sessions devoted to a single type of problem, requiring constant primary reinforcement in such a way that a sequence, glossed by Rumbaugh and his associates as "Please machine give Lana M &amp; M" or "Please machine give Lana piece of raisin," "can be analyzed as a complex X - R chain." Such two-step,</page><page sequence="25">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 113 chained associations would be the equivalent, they say, of the learning of a rat in a double-T maze. The Gardners (1980a : 317) have also criticized the inter- pretations made of Lana's performances, claiming that all Lana had to do to get a reward was to produce one of a very small number of correct color sequen- ces on her computer console. "There is no reason to suppose," therefore, "that Lana's productions have any semantic content." The large number of drill sessions with the same small set of keys and stimulus arrays, they add, would not "have placed any great strain on the rote memory of a chimpanzee" (cf. Fouts and Rigby 1980). Several commentators have, moreover, suggested simp- ler explanations of the tool use and exchange by the chimpanzees, Austin and Sherman, described by Savage- Rumbaugh et al. (1980). Jolly, for example, remarks that "the cleverness ... is the experimenters' not the chimps'" (1978: 580) . "At the circus we applaud with awe as the human acrobat brachiates above ground," she continues (ibid.), "[t]hen we chortle when bediapered chimps waddle in on their hind legs and sit down to tea. Could the authors now devise an intellectual equivalent of letting the chimpanzees loose on the trapeze?" (cf. Lockard 1978; Mellgren and Fouts 1978). Harlow (cited in Hill 1980: 337) concluded his review of the Premack project by describing it as "a series of learned tasks ranging in difficulty from simple discrimination to relatively simple matching-from-sample problems." While Harlow compares Sarah's performances with "more complex learning accomplished by macaques," Terrace et al. compare (1979: 899 f.) the multisign utterances of both Sarah and Lana with the problem-solving of pigeons trained by Sträub and others to respond to nonsense symbols in a fixed order (see also Chomsky 1980 and Ristau and Robbins 1979: 272). Apparently, pigeons can learn to peck arrays of four colors in a particular sequence, irrespective of the physical position of the colors. If, as seems likely, they say, pigeons can also be trained to respond to ABCX problems, where X could refer to a variety of objects or actions, such performances could be compared with the chimpanzees' "Mary give Sarah apple," or "Please machine give apple," but why refer to the sequence, "green, white, red, blue" as "Trainer give R-42 grain" ? Schubert also questions the assignment of English labels by Rumbaugh and his collaborators to the computer lexigrams manipulated by their subjects, Lana, Austin, Sherman, arguing that, in the case of some of these translations, such as "straw" in the tool exchange experiment described in Savage-Rumbaugh et al. (1980), the experimenters "cash in on the overtones of the word" (1978: 598) in an unintentionally misleading way. Epstein et al. recreated, with some modifications, the experiment by Savage-Rumbaugh et al. (1978), using pigeons instead of primates. Their subjects, "Jack" and "Jill," demonstrated an ability to "engage in a sustained and natural conversation without human intervention," showing as well that "one pigeon can transmit information to another entirely through the use of symbols" (Epstein et al. 1980: 545), accor- ding to one possible interpretation. A more parsimonious explanation, the authors maintain, would be that "The performances were established through standard fading, shaping, chaining, and discrimination procedures ... A similar account may be given of the Rumbaugh procedure" (ibid.). On the basis of a Anthropos 76. 1981 8</page><page sequence="26">114 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 rigorous analysis of the manipulation of the Yerkish computerized symbols by the chimpanzee Lana, which was designed to examine the extent to which simple reinforcement principles can explain her reactions, Thompson and Church conclude that most of the animal's performances can be attributed to two basic processes - namely, (1) conditional discrimination learning, where situational cues determine the selection of one sentence from a small set of six stock sentences, and (2) paired-associate learning, or the coupling of a lexigram with an object, person, or event (1980). The comparison of apes with pigeons, and Brown's discussion (1973) of Premack's work and the "pigeon ping-pong problem" - i. e., you can teach two pigeons to bat a ball, but is it ping-pong? - points up the degree to which the selection of apes for this type of research introduces substantial distortion of perspective. We are much more likely to anthropomorphize an ape's performan- ce, accepting English glosses as appropriate, than we are that of a pigeon, rat, or woodpecker (see below). Certainly our tendency to perceive apes as either humans who have not had the benefit of enculturation, much as the so-called "wolf" children, or as mentally retarded children - both documented by Desmond (1979) - accounts in large measure for the numerous instances of completely spurious attributions of understanding of complex social and emo- tive terms, such as sorry, please, happy, sad, good, bad, funny, and various expletives, to chimpanzees and gorillas (Petitto and Seidenberg 1979). It is up to those doing this sort of work to prove that the sequences of symbols produced by an ape are evidence of linguistic relationships. Simply assigning English glosses is appealing, but insufficient as well as misleading. Lenneberg (1975), using normal high school students, replicated Premack's study as closely as possible and found that, while the human subjects quickly outperformed Premack's chimpanzees, they could not correctly translate into English any of the sentences which they themselves had completed. Thinking that they were merely solving puzzles, the subjects failed to connect the plastic tokens with language. It is also misleading to assume, as do Fouts, the Gardners, and Patterson, that, because a chimpanzee or gorilla produces hand configurations similar to those used by deaf users of ASL, the animal is employing signs as does his human counterpart. Even overlooking the fact that "at the level of hand shapes, the degree of correspondence [with human ASL] is questionable" (Petitto and Seidenberg 1979: 165), the form of a behavior cannot determine its status as a linguistic unit - much as the vocal imitations of psittacine birds - and, in the absence of detailed descriptions of the contexts of the apes' performances, it is impossible to tell what extent the form-function association approximates that of a human ASL user (ibid. : 166). Although some of the apes' behaviors may be similar to some of the formational components of ASL signs ..., there is no indication that any of their gestures show the exact configurations of hand shape, movement, orientation, and location which characte- rize signs in ASL ... The differences between the apes' behaviors and signing in ASL are profound (ibid.: 175).</page><page sequence="27">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 115 In what is certainly the most skeptical approach yet made to this type of data, Terrace and his associates (n. d., 1979; Sanders and Terrace 1979; Terrace 1979, 1980a), analyzing over 19,000 combinations of two or more signs produced by the chimpanzee Nim, reached the conclusion that each instance of what appeared to be grammatical competence on the animal's part could be adequately explained by simpler, nonlinguistic processes. The examination of videotaped records of dialogues between Nim and his human trainers indi- cated "a strong tendency for the chimpanzee to sign only when the teacher signs to him," and "60 % of the chimpanzee's signed utterances imitated one or more signs from the teacher's prior utterances" (Sanders and Terrace 1979), and non- imitative utterances tended to be stock expressions used repeatedly to obtain rewards from the teacher. Nim was transformed not so much into a Pygmalion in the classroom as a circus chimp in human disguise. 7. Clever Hans Effect This brings us to the third issue at stake here, that is, the possibility of the human observer unintentionally modifying the animal's behavior to produce the desired results. It may never be feasible to exclude the fallible human half of the dyad under conditions of apprentissage, let alone the looser protocols of dressage. Hediger deems the task of elimination of the Clever Hans effect ana- logous to squaring the circle, if only for the reason that every experimental method is necessarily a human method and must thus per se constitute a human influence on the animal ... The concept of an experiment with animals - be it psychological, physiological or pharmacological - without some direct or indirect contact between human being and animals is basically untenable (1974: 29). When this statement is considered in the light of Niels Bohr's comple- mentarity principle, the unavoidable interaction between the observer and the system observed is seen to impose the ultimate limitation on the knowability of the "real" state of affairs. The quantum of action couples the observer with the system observed such that an observation necessarily changes the observed system. If Hediger is right, as we believe he is, then the door always remains wide open, as well, to the subtle intrusion of a host of experimenter effects (Barber 1976) in the course of participant observation as a method to decipher animal behavior, for the technique necessarily hinges on a particular hermeneutic : the interpénétration of signs by and of actors in the game. This holds a fortiori for animals, such as all apes, which can scarcely survive in the absence of an intense level of social intercourse with their handler before they are capable of under- going the rigors of training for any task. We have already noted the often profound emotional, even quasi-familial ties that exist between the apes learn- ing ASL or an artificial language and their trainers, to the extent that the apes' performances uniformly declined - or the animals refused to cooperate altogether - when faced with a novel interlocutor in a double-blind testing</page><page sequence="28">116 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 situation. The temperamental response of a subject has been an all too con- vient excuse used by investigators for not relying more heavily on outside experimenters in direct tests of ape language capacities. As in some parapsycho- logical research, the basic rule that subjects do not select their own experimen- ter is broken when chimpanzees or gorillas are allowed to exclude certain individuals or classes of persons from testing situations. Randi (1975) has shown how important it is to Uri Geller and other so-called psychics that skeptical observers be excluded from tests of their special powers. He also demonstrated how it is the extraordinary personal control Geller has over the perceptions and expressions of sympathetic observers that makes it possible for him to appear to them as a true psychic. Kreskin (1973: 26f.), in his discussion of ESP (extrasensory perception) as entertainment, explains how he goes about cap- turing an audience : Rapport with the audience is built up through verbal contact, and to a lesser extent, body movement. The latter is not studied but does coordinate with patter to command attention. I attempt to keep all eyes on me. I then go about creating a climate for suggesti- ble responses, literally playing it by ear and "feel" until I can sense that the audience is ready for communication and response. The main task is to instill faith, establish a "faith- prestige" relationship early. It may take fifteen or twenty minutes but the audience is seldom aware that the program is rapidly changing from the establishment of rapport and the conditioning of conjuring to an area far removed from magic. When volunteers come up onstage, they are unknowingly ready for response. In any case, it would be interesting to know precisely why the animals in the ape "language" researches have such difficulty performing for strangers. A related issue concerns the personal preferences exhibited by the apes for certain project members. All of the animals used so far in the ape "language" projects have shown some preference for certain trainers, performing better for these "favorites" than for the rest, but there has been no systematic attempt to account for these differential responses on the part of the animals. As Hill (1980: 348) has pointed out, project reports have not "attended to the possibili- ty that the chimpanzees have input into the communication dynamics, and hence into the society being constructed. The chimpanzees have often been seen as exclusively receptive ; the interest in their output has been in its structu- ral complexity and lexical variety." But, as Hill has noted, it is clear from many anecdotes, as well as from the very design features of some of the testing and training protocols, that there is a great deal of input from the animals in these experiments, and this input should be considered seriously as a component of every procedure followed. The ape subjects are not the only ones to show a preference for certain project personnel, of course. Investigators appear to favor certain subjects - no- tably such "star" performers as Washoe, Koko, and Sarah - and their reports tend to emphasize the results obtained with these animals over those stemming from the behavior of less gifted individuals. Thus what Barber calls the "Inves- tigator Data Analysis Effect" (1976: 19 ff.) 9 comes into play when, for example, 9 Ristau and Robbins (1979: 271f.) discuss another type of Investigator Data Analysis Effect, this one in relation to the Lana project. Lana was obliged to end all her</page><page sequence="29">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 117 an investigator obtains negative results with some animals and fails to report them, excluding from his analysis subjects which do not conform to his predic- tions and thereby distorting the reliability of his conclusions as to the signifi- cance of his data. A particularly disturbing example of this type of pitfall is found in Premack's work. In his book (1976), for example, an early chapter, devoted to a discussion of the experimental subjects used and containing a series of ad hoc justifications for the poor performances of several chimpanzee subjects, is followed by others in which not only are the performances of Sarah, his prize pupil, highlighted, but it is often over-painted exactly which subjects are being discussed. Savage-Rumbaugh (1979: 293) criticizes other ape "language" research projects for not retaining subjects "not particularly adept or behaviorally pleasant to work with." As in any behavioral research, experimenters in the ape "language" projects differed in their rate of success in teaching the animals. Terrace and his colleagues (n. d. : 14 f.), for example, report that some of Nim's teachers were much better at their job than were others, so much so that they conclude that the rate of learning by the animal could be said to tell as much about the human involved as about the chimpanzee. It is regrettable that, once again, individual differences in success in teaching subjects have received so little attention from investigators in this field, especially since numerous studies have shown that "experimenters differing in such characteristics as sex, age, ethnic identity, prestige, anxiety, friendliness, dominance, and warmth at times obtained divergent results when testing similar [human] subjects," and that such an "Experimenter Personal Attributes Effect has been found on a wide variety of tasks including intelligence tests, projective tests, verbal conditioning tasks, and other physiological and educational measures" (Barber 1976: 47). At the very least, investigators who do not use a good sample of experimenters should, as Barber suggests, state the conclusions from their studies more cautiously, including a proviso that the results may be restricted to the specific kind of experimenter(s) used. Pfungst, it may be remembered, also underlined that certain questioners were more successful than others in eliciting correct responses from Hans, and that "Hans acquired a reputation for 'Einkennigkeit,' that is, he would accus- tom himself only to certain persons. ...Such a reputation was," as he said, "hard to reconcile with his much praised intelligence" (1965: 210). Hans pre- ferred, and performed best for, as Pfungst discovered, persons who exhibited (1) an "air of quiet authority," (2) intense concentration, (3) a "facility of motor discharge," and (4) the power to "distribute tension economically" [ibid.). In other words, the successful examiner, focusing intently on the horse's tapping or other responses and on the anticipated perception of a correct movement, was able to sustain a tension and release it at the right moment, in such a way sentences by pushing a "period" key on her computer console. Investigators assumed that, when the chimpanzee depressed this key if a grammatically incorrect sentence was in progress, she meant "erase," while she might just as well merely have intended to end that sentence, knowing that a reward would be forthcoming only if she did so.</page><page sequence="30">118 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 that a detectable movement resulted, a movement used by Hans as a sign to stop performing. In what is still the most thorough examination of minimal, unwitting cues between man and animal, Pfungst succeeded in explaining the bulk of errors made by Hans, not in terms of insufficiencies on the part of the horse, but rather as instances where the questioner was inattentive, tired, unaware of the correct answer, or for some other reason incapable of producing the necessary muscular sign. Pfungst was even able to show the relationship between skepticism on the part of the experimenter and the poorer performance of the animal with such an examiner. A skeptical observer, he noted (ibid.: 144f.), had a lower degree of concentration than one who expected to see Hans perform correctly. The skeptic thus did not relax at the proper moment, resulting most often in Hans tapping with greater frequency than was necessary for a "correct" response to an arithmetical question. The nonbeliever, it would seem, relaxed after his suspicion that the horse would not stop at the correct number had been confirmed. Hans, of course, did not know the difference be- tween this and the correctly timed cue of relaxation given off by less skeptical observers. Timaeus (1974: 155) has restudied and to a degree refined Pfungst's procedures. His reinvestigation essentially confirmed the accuracy of Pfungst's work, but he did not assign as great a significance to head movements as did Pfungst. His analysis, on the other hand, uncovered eight sources of cuing, to wit : 1) eyes: blinking, changes in gaze direction 5) hands: hand movements 2) head: head movements upwards, 6) jaw: changes in muscle downwards, and sideways tension 3) mouth: changes in lip configuration 7) voiceless counting along 4) body: changes in postural tension 8) breathing: patterns of inhalation. Timaeus further found that all these cues took place in a fixed order, which we interpret as imparting, to the horse, a great deal of redundancy. Timaeus, like Pfungst, confirmed that these types of cues were responsible for incorrect as well as correct responses (for his tabulations see Tables 52 and 53, pp. 154 and 156). Despite the fact that the issue is still hotly debated among psychologists (see, e. g., Barber's critique - 1976: 64 ff.), a recent review of 345 studies of "interpersonal expectancy effects" (or "interpersonal self-fulfilling prophecies") by Rosenthal and Rubin (1978: 377) suggests that there is ample reason to believe that, as they put it, Effects of interpersonal expectations are pervasive and of special importance, both scientific and social ... Apparently, when behavioral researchers, teachers, or supervisors expect a certain level of performance from their subjects, pupils, or subordinates, they somehow unwittingly treat them in such a way as to increase the probability that they will behave as expected. One of the findings of Rosenthal and Rubin which should serve as a warning to investigators and experimenters involved in the ape "language" projects is that this interpersonal expectancy effect was especially large for</page><page sequence="31">Cie ver Hans and Smart Simians 119 studies of animal learning, a fact which Ellsworth suggests may be due to a combination of three features of such research - namely, (1) repeated measures are taken on the same subjects (especially when the experimenter is aware of the subject's responses); (2) an experimenter runs subjects in only one condi- tion; and (3) the design of the research or the predicted behavior is simple (Ellsworth 1978: 393; see also Carlsmith et al 1976). Regarding the last of these characteristics, it should be noted that it is still open to question how complex a task has to be to render Clever Hans cuing unlikely. Rosenthal (in Pf ungst 1965 : xxxvii note 4) describes the case of Lady, the talking horse of Richmond, Virginia, who was reputed to be a good finder of lost objects. When consulted about a missing dog, Lady, operating a special typewriter, spelled out the word "dead." In some way, not at all apparent to even a keen observer, the horse's owner [sensing the dog's owner's belief that her pet had been killed] must have communicated to her the sequence of appropriate keyboard responses. It is one thing to find the cues that start and stop a horse's tapping. It is quite another to find the cues that lead a horse to choose one letter out of 26 and then another and another, especially when the 'keys' of the typewriter are quite close together. To learn the unintentional (if it was unintentional) signaling system in this case would have provided Pf ungst with another worthy challenge. Each of the ape "language" projects suffers from at least one, and usually a combination of these three factors. This makes it all the more important that, in the future, investigators assign a much greater importance to the explora- tion of both "procedures for minimizing and calibrating the effects of experi- menter expectations" (as far as we know, there has been no controlled attempt to ascertain the impact of experimenter expectations on ape performances) and the fundamental semiotic problem of the "role of non-verbal processes of communication mediating interpersonal expectancy effects" (Rosenthal and Rubin 1978: 385). 8. Antecedents of Ape "Language" Researches Alternatively, Ockham allows, dogma - viz., the articles of faith - may impose the benchmark. The prevailing Darwinian tenet that fuels, or constrains, most of the investigations of ape linguistic capacity postulates (as the subtitle of Griffin's 1976 contribution to cognitive ethology also perfectly captures) the "evolutionary continuity of mental experience." The countervailing older type of psychology defines the animal, following Descartes, as a push-pull automa- ton, and, as an inevitable consequence of that definition, affirms the superiority of man over the brutes. His slogan, which has influenced the thought of all generations that came after, was formulated in quasi-semiotic terms: "instinct and reason, the signs of two natures." The historical roots of the ensuing dia- lectic are sketched in Limber's paper (1980; see also Desmond 1979; Sebeok 19786), but no doubt take on special evolutionary meaning in the context of the great African apes, notably both varieties of Pan. On the one hand, as we know since 1975 (King and Wilson), the difference in structural genes between "us"</page><page sequence="32">120 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 and "them" is astoundingly small, for the average human polypeptide was reported to be more than 99 % identical with its counterpart in chimpanzees, although the data, by the same token, also indicated that one-quarter of the proteins were genetically different (i. e., while the DNA is very similar, the proteins are substantially unlike - cf. Plomin and Kuse 1979 : 189). On the other hand, adult chimpanzees do not conspicuously resemble grown-up people, and their respective behavior patterns - most particularly with respect to the semio- sic faculty - are separated by a chasm the depth of which remains unplumbed and which therefore persists as a major concern (cf. Ristau and Robbins 1979: 295). The fulcrum of our profound phenotypic and adaptive disunion from the chimpanzees and the gorilla must lie in the differential timing of gene expres- sion during brain development. The regulatory changes have a retarding in- fluence upon our unfolding. Fetal growth rates eventuate in hypertrophy of the organ-complex controlling (among other effects) human linguistic competence for speaking and in processing the speech of others, in brief, the language-using animal's species-specific behavior. As Suzanne Chevalier-Skolnikoff has found (work in progress; cf. 1976), baby chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans develop behavior patterns during the first 24 months of their lives that closely resemble those of human infants on Piaget's six-stage model of intellectual and motor development. The pivotal difference is that young apes stop advancing in their vocalization at an early age, which then presumably accounts for differential subsequent maturation. While orangutans, too, cry at birth, only human infants go on to more sophis- ticated vocalizations, to wit, successively, cooing, laughing and babbling, combining phonemes, using words instrumentally, and creating two-morpheme phrases. Alloprimates never coo, never babble, never acquire more elaborate ways of articulating. Malmi (1980) has wisely warned against the use of either simple analogies or the design-feature approach to language as arguments for evolutionary con- tinuity in language development. The much more stringent criteria of true homologies - based especially on the examination of neurological substrates - must be met before conclusions about the biological roots of man's semiotic system par excellence can be drawn. And "presumed phylogenetic closeness is not sufficient to establish behavioral homology, especially when the behavior does not naturally occur in one of the species but is elicited only through ex- tensive training" [ibid.: 192), as is the case with language-like systems of communication. 10 This admonition is of special importance in light of some ape 10 On the subject of homology vs. analogy, see also Chomsky 1979, 1980; Hediger 1980; and Lenneberg 1980a, 19806. For a recent discussion of the linguistically relevant neurophysiological differences between man and ape, see Popper and Eccles 1977 (308f .) ; Desmond 1979. In passing, it might be noted that it is now known "that the sexually dimorphic vocal control pathways of canaries and zebra finches are responsible for song, which in these species is a complex learned motor skill ..." See Nottebohm and Arnold (1979: 769), who also point out that the behavioral significance of brain sexual dimor- phism, particularly in the preoptic area of rats, still awaits investigation. The connectivity of the sexually dimorphic regions in apes remains undescribed.</page><page sequence="33">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 121 "language" researchers' stubborn insistence (e. g., Fouts et al. 1979) on over- looking the significance of the self-fulfilling prophecy in their work, preferring instead to interpret as homologous with a language-learning child's the behav- ior of animals masquerading - in the eyes of their trainers - as loquacious little people. African apes were not always, of course, judged the fashionable, or even the ideal, animal models for simulating man's linguistic behavior. It is note- worthy that the ape chosen, around 1908, as the first candidate for language training, by University of Pennsylvania's Lightner Witmer, was the chimpanzee Peter, who attracted the scientist's attention by his astute stage imitations of humans, most notably as a star rollerskater. This performing chimpanzee did not actually undergo long-term language schooling, but the idea of such an undertaking was passed on, by Witmer, to a Philadelphia physician by the name of William H. Furness, who worked intensively on teaching language to a native-born chimpanzee and two orangutans between 1909 and 1914. Furness eventually admitted that his attempts to train the animals to comprehend or produce speech had failed. He observed that the apes, rather than acting accor- ding to an understanding of linguistic signs, were instead using his gestures and facial expressions, either some or all of the time, as unwitting cues to what response was required of them. When Furness was not present, the animals fai- led their tests of comprehension (Furness 1916; cf. Desmond 1979: 61 if.). Cu- riously, later researchers totally ignored this important discovery, and the chim- panzee series was begun in earnest. The gorilla than first entered stage center in the last decade. Despite Furness' difficulties, and Galdikas' remark (1978: 291) that "a worse model ... than wild orangutans could not possibly be imagi- ned," Asia's sole living species of great ape is now also undergoing ASL training; under the supervision of Lyn Miles, in Tennessee. (Cf. work with a male infant orangutan by Fouts [1973], and a Premack-inspired experiment with a 4-year- old female orangutan, by Shapiro [1975].) In the early 1960's, the mystique of the porpoise (or dolphin) began to captivate the imagination of the public. Dolphins were claimed to be capable of producing sounds like those of human speech and to engage in audio- mimetic activities. We were told - with undeniable accuracy - by an investi- gator with medical credentials: "The dolphins may learn English (or Russian) or they may not ..." (Lilly 1978: 188). Recently, their superiority over primates is contrastively insinuated : The almost unbelievable ability of the dolphin to match the sounds of human speech can further be appreciated by examining communication with the apes. The human and the dolphin share the capability of communication by means of sounds. The chimpan- zee and the gorilla cannot do this with any degree of complexity whatsoever (ibid.: 78). The fact is that marine mammals have never been proven to possess the rudiments of language (cf. Wood 1973 : 118, specifically with respect to por- poises); in Wilson's judgment (1975: 474), among others', the communication system and social organization of delphinids generally "appears to be of a conventional mammalian type." This is not surprising, for the outcome of even the best designed experiment has shown that "dolphin social behavior is much</page><page sequence="34">122 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 more akin to the example of elephant seal social behavior than it is to human linguistic behavior" (Evans and Bastian 1969: 433). William Langbauer's Porpoise Language Acquisition Project, patterned after Premack's experimen- tal design with Sarah, appears, so far, to have made little progress (Linehan 1979: 529, 533). Once again, by the stringent application of Ockham's razor, the dolphins' performance is sufficiently explained by the inadvertent condition- ing postulated by Bastian, coupled, probably, with a modicum of trial and success. While it is quite safe now to prognosticate that, within this decade, many computers will be able to talk - if not yet necessarily listen - in "human language," it is equally certain, we think, that no porpoise will ever be able to either generate or understand continuous speech on a remotely comparable level of linguistic and contextual sensitivity. Needless to emphasize, for com- puters to achieve the implied level of sophistication, vast but justifiable funding will be required; money spent on chimerical experimentation with speechless creatures of the deep to be hominified is, however, tantamount to squandering scarce resources. Apes, Cadillac-like, being also expensive animals to maintain in home or laboratory, it is small wonder that their "linguistic" tutelage has, so far, proceeded exclusively in America, wholly with domestic support. In France, the Renault of animals appears to have been the Greater Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), the natural drumming behavior of which was molded by Chauvin-Muckensturm (1974) against an object in association with selective food demands. The woodpecker was taught the use of the following code : one tap for a pistachio nut, two taps for a house cricket, three taps for a mealworm, two plus two taps for a May bug, and two plus two plus two taps for a locust. The investigator's conclusion was that this bird's behavior "seems to represent a phenomenon of man-animal communication analogous to that found in monkeys by the Gardners and Premack [sic]" (ibid.: 185). This seemingly exorbitant comparison is buttressed by a functional equation of the bird's beak with the simian's hand, an identification which may be less shocking if one is prepared to accept a common characterization of some birds (notably the psittacines) as "the monkeys of the bird world" (Breland and Breland 1966: 106). The code-drumming woodpecker carries us back to code-tapping horses, and thus right to the heart of the prototypal case of Clever Hans, or to similar pseudo-communicative deportment in other domestic species. One of us has dealt with this effect in previous publications, in a semiotic frame (Sebeok 1979a, Chs. 4 and 5; for talking dogs, see id. 19796), and has a book in preparation on the broader implications and applications of the compelling principle of ideomotor behavior at work and the interacting fallacies such motor automatism nourishes. Here, it may be worth pointing out that, in its crudest form, Clever Hans seems to undergo perpetual reincarnation in one guise or another. Thus Blake (1977 : 40) now claims to have "thirty or forty proven [sic!] cases" of telepathic communication in horses, while Rowdon (1978 : 235) copiously expatiates upon the miracles wrought by a certain Mrs. Heilmaier in displaying the linguistic capacities of her dogs; he depicts the powers this lady has over animals in picturesque statements, such as: "I saw</page><page sequence="35">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 123 [a] chimpanzee leap down from his perch to the bars of the cage as if starved for conversation, to greet her and chatter to her with funny little movements of the mouth." Our credulity is no more strained by such anecdotes than by the tale of one Mucianus about the tame elephant that could write Greek (amusingly pictured in Anonymous 1891: 291). 9. Exorcising Hans' Spirit From the outset, responsible experimenters with anthropoid apes have been wary of the devastating effects of "illicit communication in the labora- tory," as Pilisuk and his collaborators (1976) refer to sub rosa semiosic activities rampant in research establishments generally. It will be remembered that all of the feats of Clever Hans were ultimately uncloaked as having amounted to nothing more than either "go" or "no go" responses to unwitting minimal cues given off by people present in the horse's milieu (for a clear, succinct account, see, e. g., Goldenson 1973: 262-279; for an analytic account, see Sebeok 1979a, Chs. 4-5). One of the earliest discussions of the possibility of the Clever Hans effect in the ape "language" projects (Ploog and Melnechuk 1971: 631-634) suffers from a number of fatal defects. Instead of evidence, heavy reliance was placed upon authority, or the observational and rhetorical powers of prominent scientists: "Brown and others vouched for [Washoe's] ability to do what was claimed for her. ... Ploog visited both [the Gardners' and Premack's] labora- tories, and he is personally convinced that no answer 'leakage' à la 'Clever Hans' accounts for the results with either Washoe or Sarah." The epistemo- logical status of such sincere prose calls for the challenge well posed by Ziman (1978 : 137-142) : "How much can be believed?" It also readily brings to mind the nuptial pads of Paul Kammerer's midwife toads, apropos of which no less an authority than Professor Stanley Gardner assured the world that "Kammerer begins where Darwin left off," to which Professor G. H. F. Nuttall added that Kammerer had made "perhaps the greatest biological discovery of the century" (Koestler 1973: 91). We must also recollect that the 1911 forgery of "Piltdown Man" was not only maintained, for over 40 years, on scarcely more than the testimony of otherwise competent scientists, such as Solías, but required a thorough reworking of the ancestral tree of humanity to accommodate "the earliest Englishman," and which was accordingly gnarled by many eminent anthropologists, such as Arthur Keith and Earnest A. Hooton (cf. Millar 1972). As Solías (1915 : 54) asserted when a question was raised about the possibility that the jaw did not belong with the skull, "The chances against this are ... so overwhelming that the conjecture may be dismissed as unworthy of serious consideration." 10. Uses of Authority and Self-Control There have been two main types of expert witnesses cited by researchers as verification of the accuracy of their results with apes learning ASL : those who have special knowledge of ASL, and those whose areas of expertise do not</page><page sequence="36">124 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 include ASL but some discipline relevant to the issues raised by this research, such as linguistics, first language acquisition by children, or physical anthro- pology. In either case, however, the outsider is dependent upon project mem- bers for the bulk of the information he receives during his visit. During our stay in Reno, in 1969, for example, we were, as guests, necessarily at the mercy of our gracious hosts, the Gardners, in terms of where and when we could view Washoe, and what additional experiences of the project - in our case, heavily edited films of the chimpanzee, casual testing of her signs in our presence using a box of well-worn objects, and discussions with some of the animal's trainers - we were allowed to have. In every case with which we are familiar, site visitors are carefully chaperoned by members of the local research team, the most impor- tant result of which is, unavoidably, that a good deal, if not all, of the former's "first-hand" observations are filtered through the commentary provided by their guides, who often furnish the frames of reference within which the observer is more likely to "perceive" what is consistent with the team's findings and expectations. This semiotic keying (Bouissac, cited by Sebeok 1979a: Ch. 5) is especially important when the visitor, although an expert in the field of language acquisition, primatology, or whatever, knows little ASL. Does such an observer actually see the ape's signs, or does he only think that what he saw corresponds to what his guide has interpreted for him, or what his earlier read- ing of research reports has led him to expect to witness ? Even when the outside observer is fluent in ASL, there may be some question about the reliability of his or her judgments about the ape's behavior (for an example, see Sebeok 1979a: Ch. 5). The visitor is, first of all, unlikely to have had much first-hand or possibly even indirect experience with chimpanzees or gorillas, and is thus unable to determine which of the actions he sees perform- ed by such an animal are part of its natural repertoire and which are the result of special training. How many of us, one wonders, are truly aware of the extent of the artifice of the Chitas we see in Tarzan movies, the clever chimpan- zees on Marlin Perkins' television show, and so forth ? He will, furthermore, be distracted by the non-signing behavior he may be witnessing - and attempting to interpret - very likely for the first time. All outside observers will be distrac- ted from the signing behavior of the ape to a certain extent by their need to accommodate themselves to the animal's individual personality - not to men- tion that of each of their hosts. Not only are the observations of such visitors suspect for this reason, but their written reports of their experiences are often anecdotal and/or based upon a reinterpretation of their "first-hand" observa- tions after consideration of the written or film materials made by or about principal investigators and/or their staff. One important problem with using deaf persons as independent judges of signing apes is that they will miss any auditory cues given the subject. This is especially relevant in the case of Koko, Nim, and Oklahoma subjects, to whom trainers were allowed to speak and make other sounds, and the flow of auditory signals was not controlled. The same problem would arise, however, in regard to the paralinguistic signs uttered by humans working with the Gardners' chimpanzees.</page><page sequence="37">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 125 Hediger (1980), expressing his misgivings about the legitimacy of claims made regarding the linguistic competence of the anthropoid apes, points to what is a major fallacy underlying all such work - namely, the assumption that scientists, even those unfamiliar with apes, can be counted on to detect social cues and/or other forms of self-deceptive manipulative behavior at play in the interactions between man and ape, while those experienced in the non-scientific training of performing animals in circuses, zoos, and similar installations are not called in to give an account of what is going on. This situation somewhat parallels that described by Randi (1975) for the investigation of Uri Geller's claims to teleport objects or persons, read minds, and the like. Geller prefers scientists as witnesses and will not perform before expert magicians, and for good reason. Scientists, by the very nature of their intellectual and social trai- ning, are among the easiest persons for a conjuror to deceive, while a good magi- cian can spot deceptive techniques in a very short time. While what is most likely to be occurring in the ape research is self-deception, in the form of experimental expectancy effects or the "trimming" or "cooking" of data by investigators (Merton 1957), as opposed to outright fraud, the question nevertheless comes to mind whether it would not be wise for the principal investigators of ape "lan- guage" projects -not to mention the funding agencies which support them -at least to seek the advice of persons who are practiced in the art of purposefully manipulating animal behavior to create the illusion of human-like activities. At the very least, but preferably in addition, those expert in the micro- analysis of human communication - in any modality - should be consulted, and not in a casual manner, but under conditions rigidly controlled by the outsiders themselves rather than the research team whose work is being inves- tigated. Someone trained in the analysis of the rhythms of dialogue, interaction ritual, or conversational sequencing, for example, would probably have brought to light much sooner the profoundly important effect on the apes of the signs used by their human interlocutors, a form of discursive cuing only recently uncovered. In the past, it was generally only the chimpanzee's or gorilla's utterances which were recorded and studied, the human's input being either summarized or cut out altogether. This trend is being reversed by Terrace and his collaborators, who have given this issue the attention it deserves, and with illuminating results (Sanders and Terrace 1979; Terrace 1980a; Terrace et al. n. d., 1979, 1980). Through an analysis of Nim's use of ASL, which related the chimpanzee's utterances to his trainer's earlier signs within the same discourse, these astute researchers found that Nim imitated and interrupted his teacher to a much greater extent than does a language-learning child. The teacher's signing appeared to cue the chimpanzee that it can achieve a reward, a desired object or activity, only if it uses ASL. Since Nim had learned that many of the signs used by the teacher are generally acceptable as responses and therefore useful in obtaining a reward, he imitated some of them together with other generally acceptable signs such as Nim or pronouns. Interruptions by the chimpanzee are explained by the authors in terms of the fact that the more rapidly Nim ful- filled the human's requirements, the faster he would reach his goal.</page><page sequence="38">126 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 Analysis by Terrace and his associates of films of other signing apes revealed a similar dependence on the prior utterances of an animal's teachers, even to the point that, in certain exchanges, most of the animal's signs had already been modeled by the human interlocutor before the animal used them. The authors' comparison of unedited with edited film versions of the same sequence of discourse also shows how this crucial aspect of ape signing is unwittingly masked - and the meaning of the interaction thus remarkably altered - by the usual editing of a film or videotape while preparing it for display. n The correlative proverbial formula, "Monkey see, monkey do," is amply supported in the literature of dressage, and not only by Hachet-Souplet (1897 : 79-91), whose testimony we have earlier adduced. Note the following insightful and decisive passage from Burrough's illuminating 17th chapter, dealing with performing monkeys : In training performing monkeys the instructor is greatly aided by that imitative faculty which is a characteristic of the whole monkey family. The intense passion a monkey has for mimicking the actions of persons is well known, and to such an excessive degree is this passion sometimes possessed that several instances are on record of their cutting their own throats while attempting to shave themselves, having observed some man performing that operation. It is this imitative instinct which is taken advantage of in preparing mon- keys for public exhibition. Indeed, their instruction consists mainly in the teacher perfor- ming the act for himself, for the monkey to copy (1869: 157). In the light of this and other observations, Terrace's suggestion, that "Nim could have simply imitated what his teachers were signing" (1979 : 72) seems eminently plausible, indeed, the most likely of several alternative ex- planations. The startling thing about the study by Terrace and his colleagues is that neither Nim's trainers, nor the many "expert" observers who were fluent in ASL, were aware of the discursive cuing that was occurring. Human attention was focused instead upon the content of the animal's utterances and their nonverbal context. The authors are convinced that the conspicuous differences between the conclusions they drew about chimpanzee linguistic competence on the basis of a traditional distributional analysis of Nim's signs - a method similar to, but much more thorough than, those employed in other projects - and those which resulted from their careful discourse analysis of a complete and pains- takingly transcribed film record of ape-human "conversations," casts doubt upon the bulk of previous analysis of the so-called grammaticality of ape sign sequences (ibid. : 49). It is not surprising that trainers are by and large unaware of this sort of interactive modeling, since they - not the apes - are the ones doing most of the work during the training and testing sessions. In his discussion of one of his trainers who was clearly giving social cues to Peony, Premack (1976 : 29) gives 11 On the problem of misrepresentation through several types of data reduction by the Gardners and Patterson, see Seidenberg and Petitto 1979: 183.</page><page sequence="39">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 127 us some idea of the considerable number of tasks which the trainer must per- form in such situations (e. g., "setting out the test items, following the data sheet - and doing all of this without being bitten!"), while at the same time trying to gain and maintain the attention of the animal. And yet researchers and experts alike continue to believe that they are in control not only of the verbal signs they emit in such a distracting situation, but even the nonverbal signs they give off. Premack, for example, asserts that his trainers were aware of the fact that if a chimpanzee did not know an answer it would look into the trainer's face for clues, but that the trainers controlled this by "refusing" to give clues and by redirecting the chimpanzee's attention to the task (ibid. : 2). The use of self-control as a protection against unintentional cuing is of dubious value. Pfungst (1965), after having decoded the system of minimal cues being given Clever Hans, admits that he was himself unable to keep from cuing the horse, even though he was making a conscious effort not to do so. Rosenthal, in his introduction to Pfungst's account of the investigation of Hans, discusses a number of additional examples of this, in tests of ESP, waterwitching, muscle readers, and several clever animals, where observers were incapable of control- ling their cuing of the subject under examination. Premack claims that, of the 20 trainers he used over the years, only one was found to be clearly giving social cues. There is no question but that both chimpanzees and children try to use social cues on occasion. However, I have never seen either do so with sufficient stealth to go undetec- ted by an experienced trainer, and especially not by a second trainer who observes the first trainer and the subject (1976: 29). This summary dismissal of social cues as an influence in the interaction between trainers and apes raises more questions than it answers. First, does Premack restrict "social cues" to such obvious, consciously controlled visual behaviors as direct stares and symbolic gestures? If so, he is omitting from consideration a vast array of semiosic processes in both the visual and a host of other channels which have been shown to play an important part in human and animal communication (for numerous references, see Sebeok 1976, 1979a) but which operate largely out of the awareness of interactants. Such an un- derestimation by Premack of the potential of unwitting cues is curious, in light of his earlier criticism, noted above, regarding a general lack of awareness, on the part of scholars, of the power of affective signalling. Marier notes: Far from being an impediment that somehow blunts the effectiveness of animal signalling behaviors, I would rather view the affective component as a highly sophisticated overlay that supplements the symbolic function of animal signals. Far from being detri- mental, it increases the efficiency of rapid unequivocal communication by creating highly redundant signals whose content is ... richer than we often suppose (1980: 225). Indeed, in experiments conducted by Menzel (1975), chimpanzees were able, through nonverbal means, "and without any deliberate training ..., to convey to each other the presence, direction, probable location, and the relative desirability and undesirability (if not the more precise nature) of a</page><page sequence="40">128 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 distant, hidden goal which no one had directly seen for himself." 12 Since affec- tive, nonlinguistic communication is just as crucial to effective human commu- nication as it is to animal exchanges, it would seem wise to suppose, at least until concrete evidence to the contrary is available, that it would come into play in interactions between man and ape. It is most unfortunate that there is even less known about man-ape communication than about either human or ape intraspecific codes, outside of what understanding comes from a few experiments (e. g., Exline and Yellin 1971) and anecdotes about researcher-ape signalling in the wild (e. g., VanHooff and Goodall, cited in Morris and Morris 19666) or misunderstandings between captive animals and the untutored public (e.g., Morris 1979: 155 ff.). The second question which arises with regard to Premack's comments is: what does he mean by an "experienced" trainer? Nowhere is it specified that Premack himself, or his trainers or outside observers, had received special instruction in any of the techniques of observation and control of subtle nonverbal signals - e. g., control over their own individual facial muscles or training in the recognition of the facial expressions of apes; experience in observing and understanding ape or human body movements and proxemic behavior; training in the apes' use of odors as tell-tale signs; experience in controlling one's own pupil responses - if indeed this is possible 13 - and in noting those of one's ape partner; tutoring in the use of nonlinguistic acoustic signals, such as throat clearing, breathing patterns, hums, hesitation fillers, and the like - which would make them especially qualified to perceive unwitting nonverbal cues. Without at least some of this sort of sensitivity training, on what grounds can a trainer or outside observer be said to deny conclusively that social cues are present? In a revealing passage based, presumably, on personal communications, Desmond discusses the extent to which Nim excelled, and continually surprised, Laura Petitto, his trainer for three years, with respect to his ability to detect subtle nonverbal cues of which she, and appar- ently other humans with whom he came in contact, were unaware: Nim read Laura Petitto's feelings like an open book, which made life with him occasionally precarious. She could even explore hidden aspects of her emotional self simply by trusting to Nim's heightened perception rather than her own coolly rational judgment: "he made me wary of my body," she confides, and relates an incident which explains this 12 Note that Timaeus, in his two experiments, was unable to confirm, as Pfungst had alleged, that head nodding was the critical cue for Clever Hans. He found, instead, that the most important cues came from the human examiners' eyes (1974: 164). Cf. Menzel's report (1975) concerning the importance of eye signals in chimpanzee communication. 13 Thomas Mann's fictional character Felix Krull, preparing himself in boyhood for his adult life as a confidence man, reports his success with training himself to control his pupil reactions (in Confessions of Felix Krull Confidence Man) : "I would stand in front of my mirror, concentrating all my powers in a command to my pupils to contract or expand, banishing every other thought from my mind. My persistent efforts ... were, in fact, crowned with success. At first as I stood bathed in sweat, my colour coming and going, my pupils would flicker erratically; but later I actually succeeded in contracting them to the merest points and then expanding them to great, round, mirror-like pools."</page><page sequence="41">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 129 cryptic statement. Laura was angry with someone; it was, of course, bottled up. ... By all human accounts, there was not the slightest sign of anger when she next greeted the person who had caused the upset. Yet no sooner were pleasantries exchanged than Laura un- knowingly triggered Nim's sympathetic aggression, and with hair erect he flew into an attack on the culprit. Laura is first to admit that she learnt more from Nim than he from her ... If anything, pidgin-signing cramped Nim's style ... (1979: 231). The very fact that it was only after painstaking analysis of unedited film records that verbal cuing was discovered to be operating between chim- panzees and their trainers, as noted above, not to mention the difficulty with which the Clever Hans and similar cases in the past were "cracked," should put us all on our guard against facile judgments about social cues. Actually being present at a demonstration of an ape's linguistic capacities, plus access to an unedited videotape or film of that same performance, would seem to provide the only type of data by which truly qualified observers could reach a conclu- sion - maybe - about the presence or absence of subliminal communication between trainer and ape. However, lacking these, still photographs are themselves enlightening, despite the fact that, in many cases, either the photographer has focused exclu- sively on the ape or the photograph is cropped in such a way that the human member of the dyad is totally or partially absent from the version the viewer is allowed to see. Nevertheless, when we do catch a glimpse of the trainers in action, they are anything but detached and stone-faced. In conformity with the National Geographic'^ notorious predilection for the beauty-and-the-beast motif, Francine Patterson has been featured in the majority of photographs illustrating her article (1978a). The richness of the nonverbal communication accompanying the signing of Patterson and Koko leaves little doubt that there is ample opportunity for Clever Hans cuing here. To take but two illustrations from this article, there is a series of four photographs showing Koko signing, according to the caption, "you" "dirty" "bad" "toilet." In each picture, Pat- terson's head position, facial expression, posture, and gestures change - in response to or in anticipation of Koko's signs it is impossible to tell. (It is also not possible to tell what took place in the time intervals between the four shots.) Nowhere in the text of the article is it, however, mentioned that Patterson was signalling to Koko. Just what was she doing, then? In another, two-page photograph (pp. 442 f .), Koko is shown signing "teeth" - by grinning and touch- ing her teeth with an index finger. Patterson is beside her, holding a picture of a grinning chimpanzee, and she is shown touching its teeth with her index finger! Barber (1976: Ch. 7) reviews a number of investigations of what he calls the Experimenter Failure to Follow the Procedure Effect. Citing especially Fried- man 1967 (Ch. 5), he notes that "most experimenters have serious difficulties in following the experimental procedures closely even when the experimental protocol is standardized or is not especially 'loose'" (p. 54). In addition to this, "there appear to be wide deviations in kinesic and vocal behavior on the part of the experimenter" {ibid.). Both the 'standardized' experiment and the 'standardized' experimenter, in other words, are largely an illusion. In a number of cases, photographs of apes with their trainers not only furnish important Anthropos 76. 1981 9</page><page sequence="42">130 Tean Umiker- Sebeo k and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 information not specified in the report, but may also contradict assertions which have been made in the text. For example, in Ann Premack's book about her husband's project (1976), three photographs (p. 54) reveal that, contrary to the description of working conditions given by Premack in his own book (1976), the chimpanzees - in this case, Elizabeth - were allowed to position themselves in such a way that they could see their trainer not only before and after being given a problem and solving it, but while they were placing the plastic symbols on their display board. The first photographs make up a sequence of two scenes, in the first of which Elizabeth reads the instruction on the board, and then, in the second, responds by washing an apple in a carton of water. Several things can be said about these two pictures, keeping in mind, of course, that we are not told how much time elapsed between these two scenes, or what behaviors occurred during that interval. First, in the initial photograph, although the caption explains that it is Elizabeth who is "reading" the instruc- tion, both the trainer and the ape are shown pointing to one of the tokens at the same time, their hands even appearing to touch. The trainer is, moreover, looking at Elizabeth, head tilted slightly to one side, leaning expectantly toward the board and ape. Elizabeth is looking at the board but is in such a position that she could see (and hear) the movements of the trainer. In the second picture, the trainer relaxes against the back of her chair, her shoulders no longer tense but hunched forward, and she is looking down at the carton of water, grinning. Her whole attitude is one of a person who, tense while waiting to see if the animal could make the right response, now relaxes as it does. Elizabeth, who is either about to place the apple in the water or is removing it, is not only looking directly at the trainer, but returning her grin. At which moment, we might ask, did the trainer begin the process of relaxation, which could have served to inform the chimpanzee that it was on the right path ? It was, after all, precisely the conversion of experimenters' anticipatory tension, as Clever Hans approached the correct response to a question, into involuntary cues - such as leaning back and relaxing - which permitted the horse to per- form what, to even some of the world's then leading psychologists, appeared to be mathematical and linguistic operations (Pfungst 1965). If, to return to the case of Elizabeth and her experimenter, so many obvious cues are shown in these two photographs alone, how many more were in evidence during the entire session ? In light of these observations, the following statement by Pre- mack (1971: 820f.) takes on portentous significance: Was Sarah responding to the plastic language or to nonlinguistic cues arising from the trainer's face and body? In principle, this could be tested by eliminating the non- linguistic cues.. Trainers could wear dark glasses, or, after presenting Sarah with a question, station themselves behind an opaque screen, or simply look away from her. But these measures were practically useless. When the trainer put several questions on Sarah's board and then walked away, leaving her to answer them, Sarah worked erratically or quit altogether. ... Social contact may be Sarah's primary motivation. In any case, she did not work under these circumstances. Was it, one wonders, the absence of social reward that caused Sarah to fail, or the lack of social cues ?</page><page sequence="43">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 131 In the third photograph, a different trainer is seen giving oñ equally obvious signals as Elizabeth, we are told in the caption, "writes" a message to her on the message board. The trainer is leaning forward expectantly, mouth open (whether to emit sounds or not is, of course, inaudible), 14 her hand poised in the box of tokens (grasping what one would assume is one of the symbols), eyes focused on Elizabeth. Now, if it is the ape who is writing the message, why is the trainer handling the tokens ? An obvious clue ? Possibly, for Elizabeth is looking directly at the trainer's hand which is in the box. Elizabeth is facing the trainer and could also conceivably take in the latter's facial expression, posture, and the like. Why, too, is the trainer staring so intently at the ape? It would seem likely that it would not be necessary for the human to look anywhere but at the display board in order to read Elizabeth's message. Could it be that it is as important for the trainer to be cued by her subject as the other way around? To what extent does she rely upon nonverbal cues given off by the ape to determine what the latter may "mean" by using a given token, or to learn what Elizabeth is likely to do momentarily, thus making it possible for her to intercede - unintentionally, of course - in order to steer the ape in the proper direction through cues of her own ? To take another example of a photograph illustrating the contrary of verbal descriptions, Patterson explains her use of the double-blind box test devised by the Gardners, saying that a plywood box, 12 inches high by 14 inches wide by 14 inches deep, one side of which was a removable Plexiglas window, was baited by one experimenter with a random selection from a pool of objects. "A second experimenter, who did not know the contents of the box, stood be- hind it, and when Koko started the trial by uncovering the box, asked her what she saw (Figure 4)" (1979: 340). Figure 4 consists of a photograph of Koko, seated in front of the test box, signing, according to the picture's caption, TIGER, the correct response since the box contained a toy tiger. In the photo- graph, Patterson is standing to one side of the box, not behind it, as the text states, and, in such a position, would have been able to see the contents of the box with little difficulty. Koko is clearly strong enough to move the test box around as she pleases. Under such conditions, the experimenter can hardly be said to be "blind." The photograph also shows Patterson's hand in the same configuration as Koko's signing hand, and she is obviously communicating with the gorilla through facial expression, gaze, and possibly sound. 14 As Hill (1980) has noted,, even Premack's "highly controlled" studies were "pollu- ted" by vocal English, since his trainers were permitted to say the English translation of a token aloud as they put it on the display board. Verbal accompaniments were also an accepted part of the studies by Fouts, Patterson, and Terrace. Cf. the discussion by Seidenberg and Petitto (1979: 178) on the "rich sources of nonlinguistic cuing in Koko's environment."</page><page sequence="44">132 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 11. The Double-Blind Strategy Workers in this field exhibit a touching faith in the so-called double- blind strategy (Ploog and Melnechuk 1971 : 632-686), 15 borrowed from pharma- cology, where it is now all but universally recognized that the method entails a multitude of booby traps on the experimenter's side as well as on the subject's : both "can serve as sources of unintended cues leading to the breakdown of experimenter blindness" (Rosenthal 1976: 372; see especially Tuteur 1957- 1958). Constant and Dubois (1975) have, moreover, shown how improper it is to assume that, in a double-blind study, the only pair of significant variables are the active ingredient and the placebo, and the ways in which such a study may importantly affect personnel attitudes and their interactions with subjects. Researchers have uniformly found it more difficult to test their ape subjects under the more stringent conditions of a double-blind situation than in normal, more sociable circumstances, and both chimpanzees and gorillas alike - whether using ASL or an artificial language - have shown a marked deterioration in their performance in the former, more artificial type of setting. The lack of cooperation on the part of an ape in such situations is usually described in reports in general terms rather than in detail, with frequent allusions to the animal's psychological or emotional attitude toward the "blind" experimenter, reminiscent of Clever Hans being labeled "distrustful" of ques- tioners who were unaware of the correct answers (Pfungst 1965: 201). The casualness of reports makes it extremely difficult in some cases to determine the significance of the data collected. For example, in the box test Patterson used with Koko - discussed above - the gorilla's reactions were des- cribed as follows : This test situation required a fair amount of discipline, and curiously enough we found that, like Washoe, Koko' s interest and cooperation could be secured for no more than five trials a day and two sessions per week. Her methods of avoiding the task were varied - she would either respond to all objects with the same sign, refuse to respond at all, or regress to an earlier pattern of asking to have the box opened (Patterson 1979a: 3401). Koko is said to have scored correctly 60 % of the time, or above chance, on the series of double-blind tests which were administered to her. It is reason- able to ask, however, how Koko's instances of avoiding the test - e. g., by responding to all objects with the same sign - were scored. We are not told whether or not such inappropriate responses were discounted as avoidance measures or counted as errors. Since these types of responses are not included in any of the four categories of errors listed on p. 11 of Patterson's report, we may assume that they are, in fact, not represented in the 60 % score noted above. We can only guess whether or not Koko's performance would have been below chance were a less biased accounting to have been made. 15 This faith is also demonstrated by persons serving as allegedly "blind" indepen- dent observers. For an interesting example of a case where "the judges repeatedly consi- dered themselves 'blind,'" but in effect were guided by presumably unintended verbal and contextual cues, see Marks and Kammann 1978.</page><page sequence="45">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 133 The problems with this procedure do not end here, of course. As with so many of the double-blind tests administered to the apes, no allowance has been made for the fact that, when working with such a relatively small corpus of signs, the "blind" experimenter, no doubt a clever human, may be applying certain game strategies which enable him or her to guess at what the input to the chimpanzee or gorilla has been. The "random" selection of objects placed in the test box sounds good, for example, but, if one calculates, on the basis of the various Figures and Tables provided by Patterson, that, when the double-blind tests were administered to Koko, in September, 1975, when she was four, the gorilla probably had only 107 nouns in her vocabulary which could have had objects appropriate for use in the box, each trial, with 30 objects, would constitute 28 % of her total inventory of nouns. This would surely allow a good deal of successful guessing by the "blind" experimenter (not to mention Koko), who, as a regular trainer (which we must assume was the case, since Patterson does not say that the person was independent of her project), would surely have a memory sufficient to hold 107 such items. A second strategy could also have been operating here. It is not specified whether or not different experimenters were used for each of the double-blind tests. If the same individuals were used, then several questions come to mind: First, how was the "random" selection of objects made in each trial? If not done by computer but by human, did the person making the selection choose the objects while blind-folded, perhaps pointing to them with a stick, while a third person picked them up and placed them in a box? If not, that is, if the person is aware of which items he has selected, he would surely be tempted, on subsequent trials, to vary the objects presented. The second, "blind" experi- menter could also work according to the assumption that the objects used on one trial would not be likely to recur too frequently in subsequent ones. There is, furthermore, the possibility that the "blind" experimenter, especially if familiar with Koko's earlier sign performances, could have been cued by the gorilla's nonlinguistic reactions to the objects, which were, after all, familiar to her. If, for example, Koko were accustomed to smacking her lips when presented with a preferred food, the accustomed response during the double-blind test could furnish the experimenter with valuable information about which class of objects - foods Koko likes - the animal has in view. Judging from our own observations of Koko on television, as well as reports of other apes in similar situations, such nonverbal responses are bound to occur even in the double-blind testing context, and it is difficult both to under- stand why they are so routinely ignored by researchers and to imagine how to avoid them altogether. Even an observer unfamiliar with Koko, for example, might correctly interpret some of the more obvious of the gorilla's reactions, especially when the test objects are repeated on subsequent trials with the same person as witness. In the case of the tests with Koko, the ambiguities are many, since we are not told if the blind observer had prior experience with the project, or if he was engaged in more than a single trial. Furthermore, only the overall score for the whole series of tests was reported, making it impossible to judge the effects of learning by both Koko and her human experimenters.</page><page sequence="46">134 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 The Gardners' description (1980a: 318 ff.) of their double-blind testing procedure administered to Washoe indicates a more carefully controlled situa- tion than the one just discussed. Washoe was seated in front of a booth, before a sliding door which she could open or close, behind which there was a screen on which slide pictures could be projected. One "blind" observer, called 01 (see Fig.), stood to one side of the box, and, when Washoe opened the sliding door and a slide was projected onto the screen, asked the chimpanzee in ASL what she saw. 01 then wrote down Washoe's signed response to this question and deposited the slip of paper into the message slot, where it was retrieved by an experimenter (El), who, seated behind the booth and to the left of the compartment where Washoe viewed the slides, operated the slide projector and recorded the observations of both 01 and 02. The second "blind" observer, 02, sat behind the booth, opposite Washoe, whom the former could view through a one-way mirror. In one version of the test, all three human participants were project assistants, while in another, control situation, 02 was a deaf person without any particular association with the Washoe project, 01 and El being members of the Gardners' staff. Despite the added precaution of two "blind" observers, some of the above-mentioned problems concerning experimenter learning, guessing strate- gies, and the presence of nonlinguistic cues could still be operating during the Gardners' procedure. The research assistants could, through their familiarity</page><page sequence="47">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 135 with Washoe's relatively small vocabulary, stand a good chance of guessing which object was being shown on the screen, even though the particular exemplars exhibited were changed from those used in training, and the order of presentation randomized (how, we do not know). Non-naive observers could also rely to some extent on familiar nonverbal cues given off by the chimpanzee in response to certain objects. That the two observers may have been learning both the kinds of objects likely to be used in the test and Washoe's nonlinguistic cues is shown by the fact that "their agreement increased from one test session to the next" (ibid.: 320). The use of a naive deaf observer in the 02 position does not necessarily eliminate these problems. For one reason, the Gardners report that this deaf observer was familiarized beforehand with the two vocabulary lists which might be used in the test in which they served as an observer. Why this was thought necessary is not clear, since one would assume that, if the chimpanzee's signs are good ASL signs, any native signer would have no difficulty interpreting them at first encounter, without having to study a vocabulary list. This also raises the question of what other types of information were conveyed to the deaf observer during his or her initial training period - e. g., familiar contexts of use of vocabulary items, characteristic nonlinguistic responses of Washoe or El or 01 ; (in fact, did either El or 01 have a hand in training the outside observer?). How "naive," in other words, was this deaf observer when the tests began ? Some of the danger of learning by the deaf observer could have been redu- ced if the Gardners had used a different deaf person in each trial. As it is, the fact that "The degree of agreement between the deaf observer and the project assistant during the second test was well within the range of agreement found between 01 and 02, when each was a project assistant thoroughly familiar with Washoe's signing" (ibid. : 320 ; our emphasis) may only indicate that the deaf observer was a fast learner. Outside of such ambiguities, there exists a whole set of difficulties with the double-blind tests administered to "language-learning" apes. While designed especially to eliminate the possibility of illicit communication in either direc- tion between experimenters and their subjects, a close look at those double- blind tests where enough information about the actual setting and procedures followed is available reveals that leakage is not only possible in each case, but probable. Take, for example, the Gardners' own double-blind test. After 01 writes down Washoe's response, he must pass in front of the sliding door in order to reach the message slot. If, as seems possible, the door is open as 01 passes by, he would have visual access to the interior of the viewing box. El, who operates the slide projector, may have been instructed to leave the slide on the screen until 01 has delivered a message, in which case the latter will have an opportuni- ty to see the picture and learn whether or not (1) Washoe's response was correct, and (2) the observer's reading of the chimpanzee's signs was accurate. Even assuming that 01 was not allowed to change his message en route to the message slot, this type of feedback would greatly enhance his ability to predict, in the</page><page sequence="48">136 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 fashion of a Markov chain (see Cherry 1978), which objects would be projected at a later time, as well as to develop skill in interpreting any idiosyncratic signing by the chimpanzee. What, furthermore, would prevent 01 from inad- vertently indicating to Washoe - and to 02, who could see 01 no doubt as he passed behind the chimpanzee - whether or not her response had been correct ? In his article on statistical problems in ESP research, Diaconis (1978) has demonstrated how even having no more feedback than whether or not he has made a hit or a miss in guessing ESP cards will give an alleged psychic an advantage and thus influence the outcome of the test. The Gardners report that 02 communicated his interpretations of Washoe's signs to El verbally, as they sat side by side, in which case how do we know that 01 could not hear O2's spoken observations, which might be expec- ted to influence his own, thus leading to an increased degree of agreement between the two ? Furthermore, if there is an acoustic channel open between El, who knows what the correct responses should be, and 02, what evidence is there that auditory cues were not given by El to 02, signals such as "uh-huh," coughs, the sound of shifting in his seat, and the like, which could have provided 02 with clues as to the accuracy of his own as well as Washoe's performances ? Pilisuk et al. (1976) have described a host of seemingly innocent sounds which, in laboratory experiments, can and often do function as unwitting cues to subjects. Rosenthal (Pfungst 1965: xxi) also mentions an interesting example of auditory cuing in which the experimenter, using a scratchy pen, unintention- ally cued a subject by the recording system he was using (long vs. short scratches). Was the deaf 02 totally deaf, or could he too have taken advantage of such a channel ? If totally deaf, to what extent could he control the volume of his verbal report to El? And would not El, in this case, have a tendency to raise his voice in order to acknowledge O2's response, thus making it more likely that Washoe and/or 01 (both of normal hearing) would hear him ? If El could not make use of verbal acknowledgments, did he lean back and sign to 02? Or could 02 have leaned back, thus catching a glimpse of the written record being made by El ? If there was an acoustic channel open between El and 02, and between 02 and 01 (either through the partition or through the one-way glass while 01 passed in front of the booth), would not there be reason to believe that 01 could also hear any auditory cues given by El ? Furthermore, since one-way glass does not ordinarily impede the passage of sound, we can assume that Washoe could hear O2's verbal interpretations of her signs, which might lead her to change her answer, which might be picked up by 01. We are not told whether Washoe was allowed to do so, or whether only her first response was counted. If there is an acoustic channel open between Washoe and 02, and between 02 and El, would it not seem likely that Washoe could hear any auditory feedback provided by El as well ? Even if we assume that El could not see or hear Washoe or 01, he would have to wait until both written and oral interpretations were received before projecting a new slide. This means that whichever observer finished last would</page><page sequence="49">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 137 have an opportunity to witness a larger set of chimpanzee signs, one of which, but not necessarily the first, being correct. This test could have been improved by the use of deaf Ol's and El's, relying only on written responses. 16 The Gardners seem to have thought of this, but ruled it out on the grounds that Washoe would not have performed as well with a strange 01. Since the only interaction required between 01 and Washoe was the execution of simple question-answer adjacency pairs, one wonders why this should be the case. Perhaps because this linguistic exchange was not the only behavior required by the chimpanzee ? Premack first attempted to eliminate the Clever Hans effect by testing Sarah with a "dumb" trainer, i. e., someone unfamiliar with her token language, although it is not clear precisely what type of experience the new trainer had had with Sarah prior to the tests. We are merely told that Sarah was "adapted" to the person, who "engaged in normal social behavior" with her during a preliminary stage, under conditions which "differed from those of testing" (Premack 1976: 821). As Premack describes this double-blind test (1971, 1976), the "dumb" trainer presented Sarah with a problem on the display board, following only a number code. Sarah's response was communicated by the trai- ner to a project member, stationed in an adjacent room, by microphone. The project member then told the trainer if Sarah's response was correct or not. Under these conditions, Premack reports, there was a definite "decrement in her accuracy" and a "deterioration in the form of her behavior" (1976: 34). The most striking aspect of this deterioration was a regression to an earlier form of sentence production that was once her dominant form. Early in training she had not produced sentences in their final order: she put correct words on the board in incorrect orders and then made one or two changes before settling on a final order. Although she had abandoned this mode of production at least ten months earlier, she reverted to it with the "dumb" trainer (Premack 1971: 821). This is precisely the sort of behavior one might expect the chimpanzee to exhibit if she had been searching for clues from the experimenter. She displays the tokens and then, moving them around, waits for an unintentional sign from the trainer that one arrangement is considered acceptable. It is not difficult to conjecture how even a "dumb" trainer could inad- vertently cue Sarah that a certain sequence of tokens was correct. Since the "dumb" trainer did not understand Sarah's token language, how did he know when she had "settled on" a "final order" ? It would seem logical that he would only report her first arrangement of tokens - incorrect responses, according to Premack. If the trainer did do so, and, as one must assume from Premack's discussion of this experiment, these responses were not counted as errors, then one may conclude that the project assistant in the adjacent room instructed the experimenter in some way not to go on to the next problem, but to wait for 16 The double-blind test proposed by Lenneberg (1980a), which calls for four experi- menters and which could, in principle, overcome some of the deficiencies noted above, has not, as far as we know, been used.</page><page sequence="50">138 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 further responses from Sarah. In this way, the chimpanzee could learn - relay- ed indirectly from the person in the next room - which order was acceptable, since only after that particular attempt would the "dumb" trainer be told to acknowledge her responses. In addition to this sort of cuing, Sarah may also have been relying on her memory to solve some of the problems in the double-blind test, as Brown (1980) has suggested. Premack (1976 : 34) denies that this is the case, saying that, by the time the tests were given, Sarah had experienced 2,600 sentences, and would have had to memorize that many to do as well as she did in the 58 sentences used in the tests. His explanation is, however, not as compelling as it might appear at first blush, for only 14 of the 58 test sentences were new to Sarah, and we are not told whether or not the 44 "old" sentences were taken from recently learned sets. As already noted above, furthermore, the manner in which the test frames were set up was such that Sarah did not actually have to take into account all of the signs in a sequence in order to respond correctly, so she might have had to memorize far less than Premack alleges in order to do well. In light of these considerations, Premack's estimate (1976 : 35) that about 10 % of Sarah's accuracy was due to nonlinguistic cues seems unrealistically low. Another deficiency noted in Sarah's responses was that the verticality of her sentences suffered. "Ordinarily, words were placed more or less below one another, but with the 'dumb' trainer she failed to maintain this orderliness. The sprawling sentence was another characteristic of her early behavior" (Premack 1971: 821). Again, if the symbols were "sprawling," how did the "dumb" trainer know in what order to report them to the project member? Did the latter, perhaps, impose an order on the numbers read to him, possibly also conveying to the trainer some information about proper order through the inadvertent signing of his recognition of a familiar pattern or asking questions about the exact spatial relationship between the tokens on the board ? Premack took into account that the new trainer may have, over a number of trials, learned something of Sarah's code, thereby enabling him to cue her. When he tested the trainer, he found that the latter had in fact guessed some of the rules of the token language, but also that in certain cases his inferences were incorrect, so that in some instances his cues - if responded to by the chim- panzee - would actually have led Sarah to make erroneous responses. Since Sarah did about as well on the first test with the new trainer as on subsequent ones, cuing was not deemed a significant influence on test results. If, however, the new trainer was serving as a conduit for cues coming from the person in the next room, a uniform level of performance is precisely what would be expected. While, as Ristau and Robbins remark, "the possible role of cues in these chim- panzee projects is far more difficult to imagine and cannot be so simple" (1979: 288) as those involved in the Clever Hans case, surely there is ample reason to doubt that Premack's "dumb" trainer experiment "is conclusive in that the accurate aspects of her [Sarah's] performance cannot be attributed to subtle cues given by the dumb trainer" (ibid. : 289). In the double-blind experiment with Ally mentioned above (and in another test of his understanding of in, on, and under), to take another example,</page><page sequence="51">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 139 the screen placed between the experimenter and the three possible locations in which the chimpanzee was to place a test item would have allowed the experi- menter to hear, if not see, where Ally was putting the object, and to cue him accordingly. Such cuing is all the more likely when one learns that "Ally is a hyperactive chimpanzee and often grabbed the correct item and rushed to the different possible locations before the experimenter had completely finished signing the command" (Terrace et al. 1979 : 301). Fouts and his colleagues con- cluded from this that Ally's 40 % correct score was only a conservative estimate of his ability to comprehend novel commands, since such behavior drastically lowered his overall score. Alternatively, one might take this as evidence that the chimpanzee's basic strategy in this testing situation was to respond not to the ASL command, but to the experimenter's unwitting auditory cues, produ- ced as Ally rushed toward or away from various target sites. Premack's more recent attempt (with Woodruff and Kennel 1978) to devise a test for Sarah which is free of social cues involved a paper-marking task utilizing pictures of tokens she had been trained with, plus pictures of toys, objects, and foods familiar to her. A project assistant placed in front of the chimpanzee trays with pairs of pictures of objects, and pairs of tokens. Sarah was supposed to mark with tape that member of a pair of tokens which cor- rectly described the relationship between the objects (same vs. different, similar vs. same, and similar vs. different). Sarah was later tested on same vs. different with letters of the alphabet rather than pictures of objects. The trainer was to leave the room after presenting the trays to the chimpanzee, returning only when Sarah rang a bell. Although over the five tests given, Sarah's overall score, we are told, was above chance, her accuracy for the concept "different" was only at chance level on two of the tests, as was her performance for the concept "similar" on one of them. The materials, furthermore, as Premack himself admits, tested "only rudimentary cognitive and linguistic capacities" (ibid.: 905). It is perhaps significant that, as the double-blind controls become more stringent, the tasks required of Sarah become simpler and, from the point of view of linguistic capacity, less interesting. Even in this experiment, however, the controls were not absolute, and the possibility still exists that social cues were operating in it, despite Premack's claim that "The present results cannot be interpreted in terms of the subject's sensitivity to inadvertant social cues" (ibid.). 17 For instance, it is possible that the trainer unwittingly cued Sarah as he was placing the trays in front of her. He could have inadvertently touched or pointed to a correct response while, perhaps, straightening a paper on a tray, or even merely tensed or in some other way called attention to that hand which was closer to a correct answer. Even a fleeting glimpse at the correct token could serve as a cue, as would the mere posi- 17 Premack does admit, however, that "Sarah's performance may have relied critically on quite different features of her social relationship with the trainer. He was quick to respond to her summons at the end of every trial, and praise or food was soon to follow" (ibid.: 905).</page><page sequence="52">140 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 tioning of the bell more or less close to a correct response. None of these cues would have been easily visible to the camera, or a second observer, stationed opposite the chimpanzee's cage, for the trainer would, for at least part of the time, have had to have his back to both. In addition, it seems unlikely that Sarah would always patiently wait until the trainer had left the room before proceeding to mark the paper, especially since she seemed motivated primarily by a desire for the trainer's presence, praise, or more tangible reward. Project reports all too frequently give the impression that ape subjects sit quietly through tests, while this is far from what actually happens. As several of the examples noted in this paper show, experimenters must spend a good part of testing time interacting with the animal just to get it under sufficient control to enable them to administer the test, hardly what one would call ideal experimental conditions. If cuing is feasible even when a subject is sitting still and attentive, it is even more so under the sometimes chaotic circumstances created by an ape's natural responses to such man-made situations. 12. Alone in a Crowd Sarah's paper-marking test raises an additional question concerning the double-blind strategy of the ape "language" projects. The trainer was not the only person capable of cuing Sarah in this context. Judging from the photo- graphs used to illustrate the testing situation (Premack et al. 1978: 905), there was a photographer present for all or at least some of the test, and when the trai- ner was not in the room. We are not told in the report if the photographer was familiar with Sarah's token language or not, but, with, such a restricted number of tokens as found in this particular test, it would not be difficult for anyone to learn fairly quickly which responses were correct and which ones wrong. Assuming this, then if that person was in the room when the trainer departed, he would be able to sign to Sarah by optical, acoustic and/or other means, if only by the timing of his camera shots. Even if separated by a one-way mirror, the photographer could inadvertently let Sarah know when she was about to select the correct answer by himself choosing that moment to snap a picture, which Sarah could detect. The same would apply as well to any discontinuous videotaping or filming process. This is based upon the not unreasonable assumption, supported by a study of photographs and films of several of the chimpanzee and gorilla projects, that a photographer or cameraman, if left to select what he will and will not record, is most likely to find photogenic - even dramatic - moments when the animal is doing something significant in terms of the purpose of the occasion: e. g., gesturing distinctly if it is a matter of the use of ASL, or solving a problem with tokens or computer keys, if an artificial symbol system is involved. One can also speculate - and, since very little information is ever given in reports about the procedures followed for recording events, this is all one can do at present - that there may be some sort of communication which takes place between the photographer or cameraman and the experimenter who is con-</page><page sequence="53">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 141 ducting a test. It is certainly not out of the question that a trainer, hearing a camera clicking to a start, could be primed to apply an extra ounce of uninten- tional pressure on the experimental subject to produce a significant response "for the record." If the cameraman or photographer were a project assistant, and the experimenter an outside observer, the former could actually cue the animal through the latter. Pfungst (1965: 210), who seems to have overlooked nothing in his investigation of the Clever Hans case, remarked that, while spectators did not influence Hans "[t]he effect upon the questioner ... was unmistakable." Given a calm and confident person, such as Mr. von Osten, "the questioner's zeal was increased and with it the tension of concentration." Less assured questioners, on the other hand, were distracted by the audience so that, rather than improving, the accuracy of their cuing of Hans suffered. In general, there is a frustrating lack of agreement between assertions made about a project's "usual" procedures and the reporting of any particular training or testing event, leaving the reader with only questions about whether or not a given procedure in fact lived up to the claims made for it. One partic- ularly striking example of this is provided in Rumbaugh (1977: 159 f.), where Gill and Rumbaugh give the following description of Lana's early training: Since Lana seemed to thrive on social contact, the behavioral technicians maintai- ned close contact with her and frequently entered her room to 'model' the correct behavior, taking her finger and pressing the correct key with it or pointing to the appropriate key or set of keys. Although these supportive techniques were used in the training sessions ... the experimenters gave no such assistance during the test phases in which proficiency levels ... were assessed. During the tests every precaution was taken to preclude the possibility that any extraneous cues might aid Lana's performance. Blinds were installed to deny her visual access to the experimenter; the sequence of trials for different tasks was randomized; her responses were automatically recorded by the teleprinter; and, when possible, experi- menters not involved in training were used to test Lana. While it is easy to grasp how cues could have been given during the trai- ning sessions (Gill and Rumbaugh mention, for example, that in some cases an experimenter would communicate with Lana by tapping on the walls of her room ; in Rumbaugh 1977 : 172), it is more difficult to assess the degree to which such cues have been eliminated in testing conditions. For example, of the five experiments reported in Rumbaugh 1977 (Part III, Chs. 9-13), only one actually lived up to the special "blind" conditions noted above, and this consisted merely of a cardboard screen at the window leading into Lana's room. In another report by Savage-Rumbaugh and her associates (1980: 369), we are told that, in general, "Iconic gestures have been repeatedly devised by the animals, and by the experimenters, as an adjunct to the abstract symbols available on the keyboard," such gestures serving "as an intermediate link between symbol and event." But members of the Lana project seldom discuss such gestures in their reports, rarely mentioning the possibility of acoustic, tactile, or olfactory cues, although some sound was able to pass between the animals' cages and the room in which the experimenter was located. In the test reported in Savage-Rumbaugh et al, (1980), for example, the subjects, Austin and Sherman, had to hand each other tools from one room to another; sound surely could pass through the opening needed for this, yet the trainers tested</page><page sequence="54">142 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 only for visual cues, not acoustic ones. 18 Schubert (1978) questions how "blind" the tests with Austin and Sherman really were. On the one hand, the investi- gators reported that changes in experimenters resulted in performance decre- ment during all stages of training, which suggests that some information loss must have occurred when one experimenter replaced another. The possibility of Clever Hans cues being given by the experimenters was not completely elimi- nated in this experiment, according to Schubert, because, for example, in the naming task, the experimenter stood outside the subject's room and held up a tool so that the chimpanzee could see it through a lexan wall. But if the C[himp] could see the tool well enough to distinguish it, he could also see at least part of E[xperimenter]'s hand, and perhaps part of his arm(s) too. How much more information does a chimp need to identify which human (among the small sample of available alternatives) he was dealing with? (ibid. : 598). In addition, Savage-Rumbaugh reports that the chimpanzees "could come out of the room and seek contact or comfort between trials at any point" (1980 : 13) but does not specify how the animals were informed about the defini- tion of "a trial." Can we not imagine Austin and Sherman repeatedly attempt- ing to make contact with the experimenter during trials ? During the "blind" tests of the chimpanzees' use of tools to open a container in order to obtain a reward, the Experimenter stood outside the subject's room so as not to be visible from the keyboard. He viewed the animal's request for a certain tool on a projector outside the room and then handed the animal the tool. The experimenter knew which tool was the correct one and could have provided the chimpanzee with unwitting auditory cues. When blind tests of the chimpanzee's ability to understand and comply with a request for a tool were administered, two experimenters were present. The first, Ex, was in the room with the chimpanzee, seated with his back to the projector. E2 was stationed outside the room, and, we are told, out of the view of the subject. E2 projected a tool lexigram onto the animal's projector, whereupon the subject was to note the lexigram on his projector, choose the tool and give it to Ej, who then reported his response verbally to E2, who recor- ded it. In this situation, communication between E2 and Ej was not ruled out, nor was auditory signalling between E! and the subject. While it is specified that E2 could not be seen by the subject, we are not told that the human could not see the animal - a situation not too difficult to imagine -, in which case he would be aware of the chimpanzee's actions and whether or not they were appropriate. Pertinent information could then have been communicated from human to human, and ultimately, through a variety of channels, from human back to animal. Photographs of the Yerkes facilities make it clear that the rooms used for testing contained windows, doors, portals, and transparent walls. It is 18 See the discussion by Sebeok (1979a: Ch. 5) of muscle readers, such as Eugen de Rubini, and their use of such subtle clues as tremors of the floor, faint sounds of feet, movements of arms and clothing, and the like, as cues guiding them to where an object has been hidden.</page><page sequence="55">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 143 hardly fair, under these circumstances, to expect that the reader of this pro- ject's experimental reports, in which these pictures figure prominently, will be able to conclude that, when the investigators simply claim that an experimenter stood outside the testing chamber, communication (other than by lexigrams) between man and animal was thereby eliminated. In the case of the tool using experiment, one wonders not only if the human could see the animal but also if - contrary to the description given by the investigators - the chimpanzee could in fact see the experimenter. The naivete revealed by such mind-boggling asser- tions as "It would seem reasonable to conclude that if the chimp could not see the experimenter, then the experimenter also would be unable to see the chim- panzee" (Savage- Rumbaugh 1980: 15 f.) throws doubt upon all those seemingly straightforward claims about an experimenter being "absent" or "outside" the room and outside the view of the subject. How, one might legitimately ask, did the investigators determine that the animal could at no time during trials see the experimenter? Finally, in the description of the tests of the chimpanzees' ability to perform the naming, receptive, and functional tasks together, several curious elements of the situation further reduce the significance of the experiment as a whole. First, it was only on one of six days of trials that "blind" conditions were imposed on the animals. Why, one wonders, were not all the trials blind? Second, the blind trials did not take place until the fifth of six days, which is explained by the investigators by the fact that Earlier, E's presence had been necessary to help both Cs to coordinate attention and action and to remind them of the task at hand. Without this help and structure they tended to play and to become easily distracted, like preschool children (Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1980:3661). What, one wonders, happened between the fourth and fifth days which sud- denly enabled the chimpanzees to perform so well on "blind" tests - even better, in fact, than on tests which were not blind? Certainly, despite the overly opti- mistic and unsubstantiated denial by the investigators, this increase in accuracy suggested that perhaps the animals had learned nonverbal signals during this period that enabled them to transmit information through a channel other than the sym- bols on the keyboard. Perhaps their use of the keyboard merely reflected the continuance of behaviors that they had been conditioned to emit by E, although these behaviors were no longer functional in the communication (ibid. : 367). Alternatively, it may have been the case that experimenters on that fifth day - and by then they must have been extremely eager to obtain some positive results to reward them for the long training periods which led up to that day - were not as "blind" as one is led to believe by the investigators' report. In fact, we are not given any details at all about the "blind" conditions on the inter- animal trials, merely that the experimenter was "blind." However, we have already pointed out how many sources of cuing there were in the blind tests of a single animal, and so, without further information, the scores for the inter- animal "blind" trials must be considered suspect. The investigators slip in another unknown factor here, moreover, which is mysteriously left unexplained</page><page sequence="56">144 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthmpos 76. 1981 - namely, that, on the fifth day, some of the trials were conducted with the experimenter "absent." In fact, the scores for both "absent" and "blind" conditions are reported together, making it impossible to determine whether there were any significant differences in performance level in the different situa- tions. We are not, furthermore, told what "absent" means, but, from descriptions of other experiments by this team of researchers - and from pictures of this experiment itself, in which a strange, disembodied human hand and arm appear with alarming regularity - it is highly unlikely that the subjects were in fact completely isolated from humans for entire trials. Someone had to bring them into the room, bait the containers, activate the computer, remove the animals from the room, and so forth. Why are so many details such as these omitted from a description which is aimed precisely at proving the absence of cuing? The investigators ultimately support their claim that the animals were not responding to nonverbal cues by the fact that, when the keyboards were deactivated, the animals failed miserably. To this one might respond that, as in their previous work on interanimal communication (see below), such a testing situation only proves that the animals fail (1) when the experimenters, unable to learn the correct responses by reading the keyboard, are truly "blind" - as they are not in double-blind tests - and (2) when the experimenters, aware of the correct response but wishing or expecting the animals to fail in order to prove the validity of their hypothesis, cue the animals in a negative sense, as Pfungst (1965) has shown skeptics to have done for Clever Hans. One must not assume that experimenters want their animals to succeed in all testing situations. In the majority of photographs of Lana, she is shown alone with her com- puter console, giving the impression of an interaction completely devoid of human contamination. And yet, as Terrace and Bever (1980: 186) have pointed out, "many of her most striking 'utterances1 occur with a trainer present," precisely when, as even the project members themselves agree, conditions are anything but free of social cues. When the trainers do not enter her cage or tap on the walls, they nevertheless can vary the time, rate, and choice of presentation, which leaves open the possibility that Lana's performance is still being shaped by uncontrolled factors (which often appear to be unrecorded), e. g., Lana's cage position, her drive state, the trainer's current assess- ment of her position and state, and so on {ibid. : 186). Pictures of the more stringently controlled tests raise the question of how "alone" Lana really is even under these less social conditions. Someone, after all, is taking the picture of her, and presumably can be heard by the chimpanzee while doing so. Furthermore, given the large staff associated with this project, one suspects that there might be other detectable personnel performing their varied chores in the wings. Reports of studies of apes in their natural habitat are similar in their disregard of the presence of photographers and other project staff members. Pictures of Goodall, Fossey, or Galdikas, for example, tend to delineate the romantic image of a brave, young woman alone with the beasts of the jungle. While this may appeal to us much as does the image of Jane in Tarzan stories, or the prototypal beauty in the tale of "Beauty and the Beast," it is hardly an</page><page sequence="57">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 145 accurate record of the actual, far more complex conditions of research. Designed to bolster the credibility of the findings presented in the narrative part of the report, these illustrations actually obfuscate rather than clarify, at least for the average viewer, who approaches them expecting to have verbal reports con- firmed and even amplified. In this respect, the Lana enterprise resembles the other ape "language" projects insofar as they attempt to communicate a sense of solitary splendor in which experimental animals operate, while in actual fact it is usually more a question of the subjects being "alone in a crowd." Consider, as a final example, the experiment conducted by Savage-Rumbaugh and her associates (1978) to test the ability of two chimpanzees, Austin and Sherman, to communicate symbolically with one another. Using the same computer language (Yerkish) designed for Lana, the subjects were trained to identify the symbols for 11 types of food and drink. In the first of a series of tests, the animals shared a key- board. On alternate trials, one of them was taken into an adjacent room, where it watched the experimenter bait and seal a container with one of the foods. Returning to the first room, this chimpanzee, called the "informer," was asked - by computer, we assume - what was in the container. When the informer had pushed the key on which the proper lexigram was embossed, the second chim- panzee, known as the "observer," who had not been allowed to witness the baiting of the box, but was able to watch the informer's "description" of the contents, was then permitted to request the food via the keyboard. If both chimpanzees responded appropriately, the container was opened and the food given to the subjects. The animals were correct on 33 of 35 trials. The investigators were aware that, in this test, the experimenter, who knew what was in the box, could cue the animals, which is particularly likely since, as seen in the photograph on p. 642 of the report, that person was holding each chimpanzee by a leash. 19 To control for this, in all subsequent tests the experimenter did not accompany the informer into the other room, and the box was baited by another project member. It is not stated, however, that the exper- imenter was not permitted to see the informer's lexigram description of the con- tents of the container, which means that the moment a correct response was made by the informer - which could be explained adequately on the basis of a simple X-R association - the experimenter, who knew the meaning of the symbols used, was no longer "blind," and would have therefore been in a posi- tion to cue the observer during his subsequent performance. This weakness in the experimental design would apply as well to those tests where the animals either were not allowed to see one another pushing the single keyboard they shared, only the lexigram projected above the keyboard, or they had separate keyboards in different rooms (separated by glass) on which the lexigrams were arranged in different sequences. 19 See Sebeok 1979a: 98 regarding how police officers inadvertently communicate their own expectations concerning the whereabouts of suspected criminals to the blood- hounds being used to track them. Anthropos 76. 1981 10</page><page sequence="58">146 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 In a final control experiment, the informer was not permitted to use the keyboard, but could communicate in any other way with the observer. The latter was, after 30 to 60 seconds, encouraged to use the keyboard to request the contents of the container. As opposed to their high scores on all of the earlier tests, Sherman and Austin did only four of 26 trials correctly under these conditions, which the investigators take to show that it was only through symbolic, not affective, signs that the animals had been communicating when more successful. It is possible, however, that the reason the animals' perfor- mance was so poor was due to the fact that this was the only test in which the experimenter was truly "blind" and therefore unable to provide cues. Even precluding the possibility that the experimenter was cuing the chim- panzees, another source of information was available to them which should have been taken into account by the investigators, but was not. Since the container itself was within the reach of at least one of the animals in each test situation, it is possible that its contents could have been made known to the observer (and experimenter) by lifting, shaking, or otherwise manipulating it, a trick well known to alleged clairvoyants, who, for example, in order to "see" which of a number of sealed, identical cans is filled with water, may tap their feet, walk around, or in some other unobtrusive way shake the containers, thereby solving the prob- lem by observing the different sounds or other sensations given off by the filled can. 20 In the case of Sherman and Austin, simply picking up the can for a second could tell them whether the food inside was liquid or solid, large or small. Identification of the contents could also be made by smell from a distance. Since we are in fact told by the investigators (p. 643) that "attempts to steal the container" were made by the subjects in this experiment, that "they wanted to hold, smell, and bite the container" (Savage-Rumbaugh 1980: 23), such an alternative explanation of the results does not seem too far-fetched. Additional doubt is thrown on the investigators1 interpretations of Sherman and Austin's performances by statements such as "The chimpanzees were mutually attentive and if one appeared to have difficulty finding a key, the other often tried to assist, though restrained from doing so" (Savage-Rum- baugh et al. 1978 : 643) and "Sherman and Austin were also able to use symbols to request that specific foods be given and to respond appropriately to one another's request. Thus if Sherman has an array of foods in front of him, and Austin asks for an orange, Sherman will look over the food until he finds an orange, then give it to Austin. If he has difficulty sighting the orange, Austin may point to it for him" (Savage-Rumbaugh 1980: 7). Beneath the pseudo- scientific jargon (e. g. "sighting" instead of "seeing"), one glimpses the complex man-animal and interanimal nonverbal communication taking place, complete with "assisting" (read: "grabbing," "touching," "looking," "pointing") and "restraining" (read: "tugging on leash," "pushing," "pulling," "reprimanding"). 20 See especially Randi's amusing account of Uri Geller's unsuccessful attempts to employ such methods on the "Johnny Carson Show," where special precautions had been taken to prevent cuing by Carson, who used to be a stage magician.</page><page sequence="59">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 147 13. The Clash of Umwelten in Fact and Fiction Critics have, on occasion, raised the question why the cognitive behaviors alleged to have been elicited in hand-raised apes have in no instance been obser- ved occurring in the wild. This wonder is closely paralleled by a second one: why, if apes have a strong picture-making potential in captivity, have they neither developed nor utilized it in nature (Sebeok 1979c: 36)? The usual rejoinders are sanguine: we don't as yet know enough about either the native communication system or artistic tenue of these creatures, but, any day now, someone shall catch them at it. We, however, think yet another fallacy lurks behind this optimism, one that fails to allow for the fact that apes live in a radically different phenomenal world, or what, since Jakob von Uexküll, ethologists call Umwelt (Sebeok 1979a: Ch. 10), than we do or than does any other species. An ape is not interested in verbal art, or painting, or the like, but in "apely" objects and relations, in brief, signs that are functionally meaningful to its species preeminently (cf. Hediger 1980). As Franz Kafka's (1917) ape-man tells it to the Academy, apes think with their bellies. A narrow segment of their world of signs may, of course, overlap with the modern human Umwelt. What the research community is trying to achieve - and, to a limited extent, success- fully, by means of apprentissage or dressage - is to widen this area of overlap; but it by no means follows that the expanded sign repertory will be biologically significant for the trained animal. As Desmond notes, in his discussion of Koko's alleged acquisition of signs such as those for cry, damn, sorry, and other "bla- tant misnomer[s] listed in ape vocabularies," "a word can only be absorbed if it is relevant ; and it can only be made relevant by mapping it on to one's own psychosocial framework" (1979: 54). The simple act of imitating a sign, or even using it "appropriately," "may only mean that humans understand both con- text and sign differently from the ape" (ibid.). That apes can be taught sometimes large repertoires of gestures or other visual signs - even signs which could be characterized, according to one of Peirce's trichotomies of sign classification (1931-65: 2.249) as symbols, that is when the relationship between the sign itself and its object is arbitrary -has been established by the ape "language" projects. While Premack (in Chomsky 1979: 8) emphasizes the importance of the finding that "the ape, too, can recognize the relation between an item and an arbitrary representation of an item," this should hardly surprise anyone, since, as one of us (Sebeok 1976: Ch. 8, 1979a: Ch. 1) has shown, examples of true symbols can be found throughout the animal world, including insects. One of us has commented earlier, furthermore, that what has not been proven by the ape "language" research is that the symbols used by the animals are any more propositional than the circus tricks taught apes in circuses (Umiker-Sebeok 1976). And man's ability to make propositions and, further, self-consciously arbitrary arguments, as Peirce saw, constitutes an essential part of his species-specific ethogram. Time and again, reports indicate that there is only a faint resemblance between the chimpanzee's or gorilla's application of his newly acquired semiotic tools and that of humans'. We have</page><page sequence="60">148 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 already mentioned that Sarah was primarily motivated, according to Premack, by social needs and food rewards. Such appears to be the case as well for the other animals involved in learning language-like skills. McNeill (1980: 160), for example, has remarked that Washoe's "reorganization of ASL" to express affect and messages related to social relationships while ignoring the human focus on analysis of objects and relationships between them suggests that chim- panzees are simply not interested in what humans are concerned with, and there is no reason to suppose that they would have evolved, in nature, a communi- cation system at all on a par with human language. Premack's failure to teach Sarah the plastic chip language by the observational method used by language- learning children and their parents was partially due, no doubt, to the fact that the chimpanzee simply "did not focus on those aspects of the situation that were of primary interest to the experimenters" (Ristau and Robbins 1979:275). Rumbaugh (1980 : 249 ; cf. Rumbaugh et al. 1975) has admitted that, while his "primary goal was to cultivate in Lana the desire and the skills needed to converse ... about a wide variety of subjects," Lana in fact used her computer language almost exclusively in order to solve practical problems with which she was faced, such as getting a trainer to supply her machine with a favorite food. For Lana, in other words, the symbols she had learned were primarily of instrumental value in achieving goals which could not be obtained otherwise. Similarly, the function of Nim's ASL signs was not to identify objects or convey information about the world, but rather to obtain a reward, whether this was the engagement of a human in some desired activity (such as a game of chase or tickle) or some desired object. Patterson does not specifically mention this aspect of Koko's signing, but a glance at the illustrations of a recent article (19786) reveals that, like the chimpanzees in other projects, the gorilla signs mainly when in situations where a human is holding out the promise of a reward (e. g., a glass of milk - p. 81 ; a stereo viewer - p. 82 ; a game of tickle - p. 84 and p. 86; a stethoscope - p. 85). Investigators have sought to narrow the gap between ape and human uses of language-like symbols by encouraging the intraspecific exchange of messages between trained animals and between trained and untrained animals, in the latter case with the symbol-wise ape serving as a teacher. Such attempts have achieved limited success in that the animals do exchange symbolic messages with one another, but there is, as far as we know, no evidence to date that the symbols, in such cases, function in a non-instrumental way (see, e. g., Fouts and Couch 1976; Fouts and Rigby 1980; Fouts et al. 1973, 1978; Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1978, 1980). Fouts and his colleagues (1978: 178) report, for example, that Although chimpanzee-to-chimpanzee signing has been observed ..., it is difficult to decide if a chimpanzee receiver has comprehended the signs of a chimpanzee sender. Most signed conversation between chimpanzees are one-way, with the signer actively requesting some food item or game and the receiver usually reacting either neutrally or negatively (by ignoring or leaving the dyad). Terrace (1980c), analyzing transcripts of ASL "conversations" between Ally and Booee reported in Miles (1978), claims that the animals' exchanges</page><page sequence="61">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 149 were, like Nim's, unspontaneous and concerned primarily with obtaining objects and activities from one another. Efforts to establish the cultural transmission of ASL signs from one individual to another, and from one generation to another, are made difficult by the gradual fading from view of the "star" performers, Lana, Sarah, and Washoe, which is in itself disturbing. [O]ne begins to wonder why these performing chimpanzees are no longer the sub- ject of intense study. Haven't they become unmanageable and thus dangerous to their trainers? Have they reached the limits of their abilities and resorting to a variety of learning procedures fails to improve performance? (Ristau and Robbins 1979: 294). Sexual maturity in chimpanzees and gorillas is accompanied by an increa- se in aggressivity which should be viewed, according to Hediger (1980), as a normal characteristic of the animals' life-cycle, one which, in the wild, serves an important function in the protection of individual and group territories as well as the safety of offspring. 21 Ape "language" researchers - with the exception of Premack, who, as we noted above, has described the physical dangers of work- ing with Sarah - have attempted to underplay, or even deny, the aggressive behavior of their subjects, but incidents involving attacks on trainers or obser- vers are not infrequently reported. On November 13, 1979, for example, a report appeared in the Oklahoma Daily, a student newspaper of the University of Oklahoma, about a graduate assistant with the Fouts project, Dave Rowe, whose face and hands required more than 50 stitches after an enraged Washoe bit him in April of that year. In a later story, in The Tulsa Tribune (November 29, 1979), an enraged Fouts is said to have requested that the reporter of the incident, Judy Gorman, be removed from the staff of the student publication on the grounds that she had promised to let him see the story before it was published, but did not. Gorman, the report continues, denied that such an arrangement had been made, and Fouts' request was denied by the Oklahoma University Board of Publications. Hediger, furthermore, has remarked that, on his visit to the Oklahoma project, he witnessed a cattle prod being used by Washoe's trainers (1980). Our own first-hand experience with Washoe, mentioned above, coincided with the animal's attack on another visitor, whose finger was severely bitten when he did not do as Washoe, then still a subadult, wished. The visitor, when rushed to the local hospital for first-aid treatment and a tetanus shot, learned that the Gardners were not unknown to the hospital's emergency room staff. Certainly the hope that Washoe would one day teach ASL to her offspring has not been realized, for Washoe - herself, in effect, raised as a human daugh- ter - has not shown much maternal interest in either of her two babies - who both died when still infants (see Fouts et al. 1978) - which raises the question of how "natural" are the home- or laboratory-raised animals vis-à-vis their wild conspecifics. Irrespective of any training with language-like symbol systems, 21 See Desmond (1979) for a lengthy discussion of recent reports by Goodall and other field-observers of chimpanzee hunting, killing, and even cannibalistic behaviors, the amount of which has long been underestimated.</page><page sequence="62">150 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 the former's rearing in a man-made environment must surely have altered their Umwelt. This alone makes difficult any extrapolations from the ways these symbol-using apes utilize their acquired communication skills, even were there to be significant breakthroughs in the future in this regard, to the potential adaptive significance of such symbols for the species as a whole. What we have at the moment, with respect to the interspecific communi- cation between ape and man in the ape "language" projects, is both accommo- dation and conflict between Umwelten. The chimpanzees and gorillas, placed in a totally man-made environment, whether a private home, experimental laboratory, or primate research colony, adapt themselves, somewhat reluctant- ly, by learning a number of arbitrary signifier-signified associations and by utilizing them in situations where trainers will accept no alternative type or response. They will follow certain elementary prescribed rules of play, in other words, but there is no indication that they are playing the same "game." Investigators and experimenters also accommodate themselves to the expec- tations of their animal subjects, unwittingly entering into subtle nonverbal communication with them while convincing themselves, on the basis of their own human rules of interpretation, that the apes' reactions are more human- like than direct evidence warrants. Real breakthroughs in man-ape communication are the stuff of fiction, which usually accompanies - or even anticipates - the stream of scientific research. Ramona and Desmond Morris (19666 : Ch. 2) have surveyed some early science fiction with a simian character, winding up with Pierre Boulle's 1963 satirical novel, best known in this country as The Planet of the Apes. The plot of this narrative hinges on the contrast between a language-endowed master-race of anthropoids and the human beings who, having regressed into a state of speech- lessness, are turned by them into subjects for laboratory training and worse. As mentioned elsewhere (Sebeok 1979a), it was Jules Verne, who, in The Village in the Treetops (1901), had invented the device of a German savant who undertook a fantastic scientific journey to the central African jungle. Eventual- ly, he is located by two big-game hunters - the American, John Cort, and the Frenchman, Max Huber - who, in the seemingly impenetrable forest, encounter evolution at work. The most fascinating aspect of this late and seldom read book of Verne's about "the so-called language of the monkeys" is that the protagonist and his peregrinations were made up out of bits and pieces suggested by the biographical circumstances and quasi-scientific works of Richard L. Garner, a bona fide forerunner of today's primat ologists seeking for the roots of language (Sebeok 1979a: 268, 291, note 4). Verne ordered his bricolage into a fictional maneuver, laced with equal amounts of sympathy and raillery, and capped by a moral about cooperation in adversity and its absence when the danger is dissipated. John Collier's His Monkey Wife or, Married To a Chimp (1931), remains possibly the most celebrated spoof in this fictional vein. In the course of this rich and cunningly crafted novel about erotic and racial relations, Emily, the heroine in the title, learns to understand both spoken and written English (she has read, among other classics, the Origin of Species and Murders in the Rue</page><page sequence="63">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 151 Morgue), can type quite proficiently, but never masters speech. Even at the end of the book, just prior to the consummation of her miscegenetic marriage, she continues tacitly to gesture "... with one or two of those quiet signs by which she managed to express to [her husband's] now subtler understanding almost all that she desired to communicate to him (my gracious silence he sometimes laughingly called her)." An even more thought-provoking novel on this broad theme was publi- shed, in English, in 1953, by Jean Bruller (who used the pen name Vercors), under the title, You Shall Know Them. In a trenchant and suspenseful fashion, it deals with the question : what is man ? It does so using by way of a two-faced contrast an invented hybrid species, called Paranthropus, an intermediate group of creatures familiarly known as tropls. While working out his definition of humanity, the author has much to say about language in ape, man, and the Janus-like ape-man in between. One of the characters, Captain Thropp, who "had read several scientific papers to the Natural History Society on his studies and tests on Great Apes," begins his testimony with a reference to (evidently John B.) "Wolfe's experiments ... he gave his chimpanzees a slot machine," he reports, and they "had reinvented money, and even avarice! Not abstract thinking, that?" (cf. Wolfe 1936). He continues: "Sixty years ago [Richard L.] Garner established that there's merely a quantitative difference between our language and theirs : we even have a number of sounds in common with the monkeys." He concludes by obliquely summarizing the highlights of Viki's linguistic tutelage; "[u]nfortunately the young animal died before" her surrogate parents were able to achieve success. The book ends on a hopeful note, where the judge, in his genial summing-up, argues: "Mankind resembles a very exclusive club. What we call human is defined by us alone." In other words, it is up to us to legally admit the tropis to the human community, to share the rights of man. This means searching for a legal basis for agreement to admit new members. But the setting up of such rules and regulations entails a consensus on the definition - or redefinition - of what constitutes language, a task which Chomsky has so skillfully and authoritatively undertaken (1980), but which, Sebeok has argued elsewhere (1978Ô), may be an inexécutable task, owing to the inherently indeterminate vacuousness of the term. In a recent publication about "talking dogs" (Sebeok 19796 : 4f .), reference is made to Olaf Stapledon's perfervid novel, Sirius: A Fantasy of Love and Discord (1944), which deals with the making of a super-sheepdog who develops "true speech," his life and reversion to a feral state, and ultimately his death as an outlaw. What is of interest in this context is that the scientist, Thomas Tre- lone, who works the remarkable transformation of Sirius, is well acquainted with the Kellogg paradigm (1980), but, "[c]ontrary to his original plan," and despite the fact that "apes offered the hope of more spectacular success," opts to use dogs instead. His reasons include that dogs are "capable of much greater free- dom of movement in our society," and that he regarded "the dog's temperament on the whole more capable of development to the human level." Thus, à la Gua, the puppy is raised in the familial company of the Trelones' daughter, Plaxy. His dying words were: "Plaxy-Sirius - worth while."</page><page sequence="64">152 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 Fanciful fiction featuring apes that learn to attain language capacity reaches its acme in two novels mentioned before (Sebeok 1979a: Ch. 5), Peter Dickinson's detective story, The Poison Oracle (1974), the entire plot of which is impelled by this very issue of a chimpanzee's putative propensity; and especially John Goulet's Oh* s Profit (1975), the protagonist of which is a singu- larly endowed young signing gorilla whose maleficent antagonists belong to a cabal of transformational linguists, thinly disguised but more or less recogni- zable, we are told, by the insiders who have read this roman à clef. In diverse imaginative ways, the concerns of this literary genre, from Verne to Goulet, are identical with those some of us prefer to struggle with in the mythic world of scientific objectivity: to draw distinctions between man and beast, to identify the one animal endowed with language, separated from but immersed in a sea of speechless creatures, to delineate the nature of langua- ge itself and distill the essence of mankind. As Browning's poem, "Bishop Blougram's Apology," professed in an exceptionally nice march of oxymorons: Our interest's on the dangerous edge of things. The honest thief, the tender murderer, The superstitious atheist, demireps That love and save their souls in new French books - We watch while these in equilibrium keep The giddy line midway : one step aside, They're classed and done with. I, then, keep the line Before your sagest. ... - just the men to shrink From the gross weights, coarse scales, and labels broad You offer their refinement. Fool or knave ? 14. Conclusion Throughout this discussion, we have skirted the consequential issue so competently examined by a number of authors such as Bronowski and Bellugi, Brown, Chomsky, Lenneberg, Limber, and McNeill (in Sebeok and Umiker- Sebeok 1980), by Gipper (1977), in what is the most thoroughgoing as well as satisfying analysis known, and by Chomsky and Premack (in Chomsky 1979) - namely, is what is being taught the apes really "language" ? We have done so for the simple reason that, at present, of the two related questions posed by Chomsky - "What is a human language?" and "What is a language?" - neither the first, which is open to scientific, i. e., biological, explanation, nor the second, which is not, can be finally answered. Although the debate over problems such as these is in itself of appreciable value, there seems to be no point in adding further speculative material to the fires of contention. We concur with the opinion of Ristau and Robbins (1979: 268) that, even were the question of "What is language?" resolvable by scientific method, which it is not, just as man's unique and dominant status remained intact when his other 'unique* accomplishments such as tool use and cooperative hunting were observed to occur in other species, so the existence of rudimentary linguistic skills in other species - if demonstrated - will do little to diminish man's radical differences from other species.</page><page sequence="65">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 153 In light of the wide attention given this matter in the media and in some popular books, it should, however, be noted that those investigators who accuse critics of the ape "language" projects of being biased in favor of a parti- cular and, they claim, outmoded paradigm which defines language too narrowly, may themselves be prone to what Barber (1976: 5f.) calls the Investigator Paradigm Effect, through their own special attachment to certain scientific or popular notions, some of which were discussed above (see also Hediger 1974 : 40; Sebeok 1979a). One of us has noted elsewhere (Sebeok 19786: 1041), If linguists, such as Chomsky, are to be enjoined from placing what others regard as little more than adroitly presented circus tricks of a handful of captive African apes beyond the pale of language in the technical sense, then, by the same token of a lack of clear defi- nition, the trainers cannot claim a quasi-human language propensity for their charges either. Menzel and Johnson (1978: 587), reacting to Griffin 1978a, Premack and Woodruff 1978, and Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1980, note a final ironic twist to the controversy over anthropomorphism vs. anthropocentrism : The study of "animal language," after the fashion of the target articles, may have, if anything, tended to increase rather than decrease expectations of human chauvinism and presumed "biological superiority," especially in the popular press, where it is more often suggested that chimpanzees, gorillas, and perhaps dolphins may deserve special consideration based on the outcome of research projects demonstrating their similarity to humans. Schubert (1978: 597) adds that to "appraise the relative excellence of nonhuman cognitive abilities by measuring the extent to which these conform to those characteristics of our own species" is "a very unbiological approach" (cf. Desmond 1979). If the debate over the linguistic status of the signs being taught to apes is unlikely to yield significant novel insights into the phylogenesis of language, the new line of investigation alluded to in this paper - the critical examination of the interactions between humans and between man and ape in such language- training situations - promises a rich harvest of information concerning a variety of subjects, including especially interspecific communication between man and ape. Oskar Pfungst can serve as a guide in this undertaking, for his investigation of Clever Hans is still one of the few successful attempts to discover the actual signs which mediated between the expectations of experi- menters and the performances of their animal subjects. Pfungst (1965) procee- ded from indirect evidence, such as his observations that, as the distance between Hans and his questioners increased, the animal's accuracy decreased, or that his performance suffered if the questioner did not know the correct answer, to direct evidence, from both observations of public performances and laboratory experiments, in which a number of elements of the question-answer procedure were systematically altered (e. g., the visual channel between man and animal was blocked). Through the painstaking application of this methodology, Pfungst was able to uncover several types of visual and auditory cues which were being unwittingly given Hans by questioners, his success in this endeavor leading Rosenthal to assert (in Pfungst 1965 : xxix) that "it seems clear that neither the</page><page sequence="66">154 Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok Anthropos 76. 1981 strategy nor the tactics of inquiry employed by Pfungst are in any way out- moded or irrelevant to contemporary psychology." While the basic methodology of Pfungst may still be followed in contem- porary assessments of ape linguistic capacities, today's investigator can take advantage of the vast amount of research on nonverbal communication which has been done in recent years. In moving from indirect evidence of social cuing, some of which has been presented here, to direct evidence, the microanalysis of the intraspecific and interspecific communication among men and apes must be performed by persons who have some expertise in one or more relevant areas of nonverbal communication, discourse analysis, dressage, and the like, with the support of those especially knowledgeable about experimental design, expectancy effects, and other methodological questions. The examination should be applied to all phases of those undertakings designed to teach langua- ge-like symbols to apes, including the initial familiarization of the subject (s) with trainers and research facilities, all training and testing procedures, and the informal social interactions among project personnel (and outside obser- vers) and the animals. This work demands extraordinary caution and attention to possible methodological pitfalls, for, as Arthur G. Miller has perceptively commented, "there is a magical or fantasy-like aspect to the idea that one's expectancies ... can become true merely by entertaining such anticipations" (1978: 401), and, when applied to scientific research, is threatening to those involved. 22 To make up for this, "evidence must be sufficiently powerful to counter, as it were, such a priori expectations" on the part of scientific investigators {ibid.). To be fair, the criteria for acceptance of the work of those whose research is designed to provide direct evidence of nonlinguistic explanations for the apes' use of sym- bols must be at least as stringent as those applied to work attempting to prove that the ghost of Clever Hans does not live on in the performances of today's experimental apes. In fact, both approaches - the creation of ever more care- fully controlled double-blind tests, on the one hand, and the observation and experimental manipulation of a full complement of semiosic behaviors, on the other - must go hand in hand, if, as is to be hoped, an accurate appraisal of ape linguistic capacity is to be finally accomplished. 22 Based on an anecdote by Mottershead (1959) - a notoriously eccentric (past) Director of the Chester Zoo - Leyhausen (1973 : 377-378) takes it for granted that chim- panzees in captivity, " contrary to everything anyone thought they knew so far about [their] ability to communicate among themselves, one chimpanzee [was] able to send another to a particular spot without somehow leading it there, " and proceeds to interpret the unverified story "that one chimpanzee could send another in a particular direction by means of its eyes." He does not even question the veridicality of the data before attempting an elaborate exegesis, although there is reason to suspect that the "report" may well have simply been a case of English drôlerie.</page><page sequence="67">Clever Hans and Smart Simians 155 15. Postscript: Confessions, Conversions, Concessions, and Crusades As early as 1970, I essentially quit concentrating on the attempt to operationally analyze some aspects of human language, develop training procedures for them and instill them in the ape, because it was clear to me that the accomplishments of which the ape was capable with regard to human-type language were very slight. ... Early demonstra- tions and misinterpretations, or overinterpretations, of language-like performance in apes led many people to conclude that the differences between ape and man were enormously less than had been contended. However, I never took language-like performances to signal a reduction in the differences between man and other species. I don't believe that the principle of biological continuity implies such a reduction (Premack in Chomsky 1979: 8). When I began my study with a male chimp called Nim Chimpsky, I hoped to demonstrate that apes can, indeed, form sentences. I wanted to ... show that grammatical rules are needed to describe many of an ape's utterances. ... I discovered that the sequences of words that looked like sentences were subtle imitations of the teacher's sequences. I could find no evidence confirming an ape's grammatical competence, either in my own data or those of others, that could not be explained by simpler processes. ... Much as I would have preferred otherwise, a chimpanzee's "Report to an Academy" remains a work of fiction (Terrace 1979: 65, 76). We are far more conservative now than we were seven or eight years ago with respect to what an ape can do. Lana showed some sensitivity to the rules of grammar, but we have no evidence that she productively comprehended syntax and the meaning of words at the same time. ... her performance was inconsistent. We couldn't call it a reliable behavior (Rumbaugh in Sobel 1979). Frankly, we are not interested in whether or not language is the exclusive domain of man. That question leads all who address it into a quagmire of confusion, despair, and impatience. We want none of that ! (Rumbaugh and Savage-Rumbaugh 1979). Koko's data looked like Nim's data before we had consistent, well trained teachers. Now, however, Koko not only has a good grasp of language but she can make puns and rhymes. ... I agree with Dr. Terrace that no ape's syntax is identical to a human child's. There's a point where the ape falls behind and stays behind. I'm eager to review my own videotapes to see if they show any of the problems Dr. Terrace found. After that, I will try to refute his claim with solid evidence (Patterson in Sobel 1979). 23 Up to this point, the pattern of chimpanzee development has been comparable to the human pattern, but the rate of development has been much slower. Our subjects are still very immature, so that it will be several years before we can make definitive statements about the highest level of achievement, or establish a pattern of failures that could reveal qualitative differences between chimpanzee and human intelligence (Gardner and Gardner 19806). Let me out (Washoe in Harvey 1980). 23 Patterson's dissertation (19796) - a rich source of examples of every type of methodological weakness discussed here - became available to us too late to review in this article.
