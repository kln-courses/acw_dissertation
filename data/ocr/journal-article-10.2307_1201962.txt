<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume 47 OCTOBER 1967 Number 4 HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD FREDERICK SONTAG* I ET us begin with an assumption that there are at least three ways to treat any philosophical work: (1) You may inquire into its background, its history, its origins, its cultural and intellectual setting, as well as its rela- tion to its own author's other work and to that of other authors. This is the scholarly and the historical task, and it is vital to philosophy's health, if we are to have an anchor for our understand- ing. (2) You may perform exegesis on the text, working internally to make plain the thought structure, clarifying the meaning of crucial terms and estab- lishing important distinctions, pointing out the way in which certain traditional problems can successfully be dealt with on the basis provided by that author's concepts, and yet what problems of its own the new formulations encounter. Learning thus to think within another author's terms and context is the es- sence of philosophical training and a necessary prelude to any new theoreti- cal construction. If these two approaches to written philosophy exhausted our possible rela- tions to an existing work, novelty in philosophy would be either exceedingly rare or else actually impossible. Nov- elty in formulation and approach does appear at intervals, however, and this keeps philosophy exciting and its course unpredictable. Some third relation to philosophical literature, thus, must be possible. Were one philosophical doc- trine alone possible, or if a direct ap- proach to metaphysical problems could be successful, philosophers should long ago have completed their task. But if our lot is to make an indirect approach and a constant reformulation, then we must proceed through a previous philo- sophical structure, but we cannot allow ourselves to be stopped within it (2) or merely led behind it (1). This suggests that a third (3) pos- sible use can be made of any philo- sophical document (perhaps dependent on ways [1] and [2] in varying degrees and amounts), and this would be to let the philosophical text suggest its own correction, an advance beyond its own surface intent. The use of an author in a context he did not explicitly en- visage and for purposes he did not specifically intend or accomplish him- * The author holds a B.A. degree from Stanford University and a Ph.D. degree from Yale Univer- sity.

Heidegger himself has pro- duced novel formulations, so it should not be wrong to approach him with this third intent-through him to learn something new about God and time, whether or not this was his own primary interest. To say, of course, that Heidegger (or any other major author) did not intend this use for his work is probably not entirely correct. In order to form a "new view," any pioneer must himself do this revising of a previous classic, Aristotle against Plato or Heidegger in his book on Kant. It is just that once the new view is finally formulated (probably having used this third way), those who study it at least at first tend to use approaches (1) and (2) in an attempt to be able to grasp what is be- ing said, since its novel aspects fit no existing thought forms. Thus, any major writer knows this third way, is often more amenable to it than his exponents and his followers, and prob- ably continues to use it himself. Were this not true, we would not note the progression and development, which we do, internal to the thought of most major figures. Once they have begun to write, they then treat their own theories as fodder for future thought. An author is probably less attached to his own early theories than are his defenders. It will be understandable that it is not our intent to study the "early" versus "the later" Heidegger. But it is interesting that Heidegger himself fol- lows in his later writing some of the same suggestions offered here. In itself the intent of this paper is not even to point this out, since that comes closer to the internal understanding of a man's thought (2) than it does to the use of it for further construction (3). The brief "exposition" which follows is not intended to "explain" Heidegger in ways in which he has not already been understood but merely to set a context in which some further exten- sions can be drawn. Not enough has yet been done to draw the positive theological implications which may be had by "extending" Heidegger. This is said not so much concerning theological method or anthropology but concerning theory in a classical sense of a doctrine of the being of God. Here Heidegger's remarks on non-being are particularly suggestive and may actually go beyond his own original stress on time. II Heidegger is concerned because he does not think that we in our day have an answer to the question about the meaning of "Being."' If this is the case, he must first reawaken an understand- ing for the meaning of this question, and this he does by discovering "time" at the core of our being and by using time as the basis for an understanding of being. Following (3) as outlined above, our task will not be so much to understand this on its own terms or to analyze Heidegger's use of time for the revival of the problem of being. Rather, our job is to ask whether any approach via time may actually prej- udice our view of being, so that the solution to other major problems (e.g., God) are in fact made more difficult, or at least directed along certain lines. If "freedom" is the major human problem in present day philosophy, "God and time" certainly is the major current theological issue. We will not borrow Heidegger's views of being and time and then apply them to God; in-</page><page sequence="3">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 281 stead, we will try to work beyond Hei- degger in his approach to being and time, in order to see whether in this process we can learn anything new about time and God. Temporality is the meaning of the Being of that entity which Heidegger calls "dasein,"2 but immediately the question comes: Is a subjective form of being the best place to start in seek- ing for the meaning of Being? It can of course be argued that this is our only possible starting point in metaphysics, but that is itself an assumption which it is important not to make until we are certain that we have no other alterna- tives. Later in this paper we can con- sider whether temporality is really that constituative of our own structure as a knowing person, but first we must ques- tion Heidegger's view that dasein ac- tually possesses an understanding of the Being of all entities of a character other than its own3 and that time is necessarily the standpoint from which the various modes of Being must be understood.4 My suggestion (following Heidegger's own direction) is that per- haps the process can be reversed: Our knowing, existing structure can be un- derstood only in contrast with forms of Being other than its own. In what sense is time really "at the core" of our be- ing? As far as God is concerned, the issue is that, if Being is first understood in terms of temporality, it will be difficult if not impossible later on to interpret God's being in any other terms. Perhaps this is as it should be, but surely we would not want to prejudice the issue of God and time simply by assuming an approach to Being which in itself limits our options. The subjective and "an- thropological" explorations which phi- losophy and theology have been carry- ing out for some time now have been and still can be most fruitful, but it is significant that little direct discussion of God's nature seems to result from this approach, and when it does God is on the whole given an anthropomorphic setting. Can God be more directly ap- proached, and what assumption can allow this? Perhaps man must start with him- self, but what we need to ask is whether his understanding can be non-egocen- tric, capable of understanding modes of being other than its own. Perhaps we can in understanding be what we can- not be in our own being. Perhaps, al- though our being is temporally struc- tured of necessity, our understanding is not, or is so only insofar as in self- reflection man's own being is its pri- mary object. Perhaps reason has no essential being or structure of its own, except to become the mode of being of others. Like a parasite, it lives by draw- ing structure from a nature whose existence is independent from it. If this were the case, being-in-time would distinguish only some and not all of the realms of being, rather than functioning as a criterion for all being as Heidegger sees it.5 When Being is conceived of in terms of time, then Being itself is made visible in its tem- poral character, as Heidegger suggests;6 but what we must ask is whether this reflects the essential structure of all modes of Being, or just indicates that our approach will single out only certain aspects. Heidegger is convinced, of course, that "Dasein's Being finds its meaning in temporality,"7 but it still could be either that all being does not do this (unless approached via subjec- tivity), or that Dasein is not in all cases (e.g., theology) the best basis upon which to understand Being. Further-</page><page sequence="4">282 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION more, historicality and temporality might not prove to be the only basis of man's being, although clearly they are both important and very near to the center. In brief, what happens if man is approached via God, rather than God via man, as has been the attempt for some time now? This is our central question in dealing with God and time. Our issue is the question of the start- ing point for metaphysics. Must we be- gin metaphysics always with subject? And as far as methodology goes, we ought to ask whether phenomenology is difficult for theology, in that it prej- udices the description of the full range of the modes of being by its inevitable temporal bias? As Kant clearly proved, phenomena must appear in time, al- though he carefully avoided construct- ing a metaphysics of all being on this basis. If phenomenology becomes a metaphysical instrument, it may go a long way, but its beginning point will make it difficult ever to escape from temporal structure. Perhaps in order even to consider time we must first ask whether it is possible to escape from it. Otherwise we cannot be sure whether our method is itself restricting our dis- covery of Being, and it is not meta- physically very satisfactory to have to correct the starting point in order to be able to grasp more than a part of Be- ing's range, especially if the metaphys- ics is to be used for theological purposes. In metaphysics the greatest problem is to avoid methodological prejudice in the description of the modes of being. In a theory of knowledge we may ex- plain the implications of a given methodology; in metaphysics our at- tempt is to escape the limitations of a method, in the hope of seeing Being as a whole and not simply as some part. Heidegger discovers time and to a de- gree is successful in disclosing being. Now we want to set time aside as a starting point, in the hope of uncover- ing time's relation to Being and its varied modes "from the other side." To ask the question of God first is tradi- tionally to seek to escape provincialism in our approach to Being. Heidegger, of course, acknowledges his debt to Kant where the centrality of time is concerned,8 although Kant doesn't begin from the subjectivity of the subject. Such a phenomenology, Heidegger feels, is the only way to provide an ontology, but that is pre- cisely the question: Is an approach to ontology possible which does not prej- udice us in the way we relate Being and Time? Can we consider God first and determine the extent of time's in- volvement in Being's modes from that perspective? Phenomena would then become secondary and not primary. If this can be done, we would not begin with Heidegger by discovering dasein in terms of temporality, and time might not then be the central clue in ontology. Is our awareness of Being- in-the-world secondary and not pri- mary? Is the world only to be under- stood as a special case of what is not of the world, so that although we may see our world first we cannot under- stand it on its own terms? Our Being- in-the-world is, then, not itself a clue, but a problem which is to be under- stood, if at all, from outside itself. Heidegger's own increasing stress on non-being will help us with the answer here. Heidegger orients the start of his in- vestigation from Being-in-the-world.9 Can an investigation, which does not wish to begin with the centrality of time in this way, orient itself from outside the world? To begin to answer this as</page><page sequence="5">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 283 Heidegger does from subjectivity, one might ask whether our own being is determined not-by-this-world as well? To what else than our Being-in-the- world might an understanding of Being belong? If our existence is as much out of the world as in, we might from that fact build a new understanding. Have we too quickly assumed our temporal confinement, when a study of our existence in relation to non-exist- ence might reveal a side of thought (perhaps even its essential feature) not bound to this world and to time? Sense experience (where Kant noticed time's unbreakable grip) is probably inevita- bly bound, but is sense experience really the core of our existence, or is existence really centered in experiences to which time is not essentially applicable? If so, then in our own experience we might find an element that leads us beyond temporal experience, so that upon re- flection time would prove to be not universal but to govern only a portion of existence. Heidegger's explanation reveals that human existence means potentiality, change, and incompleteness, which finds an end only in death. But is this neces- sarily temporally connected? Perhaps temporality applies only to possibility in certain modes of actualization, not to possibility as it applies to Being in general. Possibility as such may exist prior to temporal application. Perhaps understanding in its concrete and actual sense is oriented in time toward the future, but understanding in the ab- stract might have no such fixed relation to the temporal but rather to the struc- ture of Being in its possible modes. If an understanding of Being in gen- eral is primary and its temporal em- bodiment only secondary, then from such an approach we might investigate Being without the necessity of time as a prior medium. Temporality would explain only part, and not all, of our subjective existence too. However, this cannot be the point at which we begin unless a certain fixation on one aspect of the life of the self can be broken: The view that the understanding of the self is to be found primarily in its relation to experience which is essen- tially temporal. To release us here, Heidegger has made a start, but we must go further now. Is our being ever non-historical, or does involvement in time exhaust our meaning? Heidegger stresses "care," but, moving beyond that, perhaps "alienation" can only be explained ade- quately if the basis for being is not essentially temporal. Is an awareness that the core of our being is a stranger to the world of sense what leads to our occasional alienation from it? Our life does not consist of a sequence of experi- ences in time between birth and death,10 but the human mode of being is a self- creating process which generates time. Or are many of our most important experiences full of meaning precisely because they seem essentially uncon- nected with time? Our unity as selves comes not from time but almost in spite of it. Meaning that unites does not lie in the series of temporal events but is given to them by insight that stands apart from time. Granted that the hu- man mode of being generates time, as selves we are in time but not of it. Temporality, then, might perhaps make possible an understanding of Being," but it could also hinder it if not over- come. Heidegger is not far from this at the point where he finds time's basic phenomena to be in the "now,"'2 for the present has always been known as</page><page sequence="6">284 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the point of identity between time and eternity. Heidegger consciously limits himself to the "world" in which a hu- man is a "being-in," but he suggests going beyond this. Can we now make what Heidegger suggests not an end but a new beginning point? What can we say here? At its central point (the now of the present) perhaps (we suggest) time passes beyond itself. Only the unstable motion that is char- acteristic of certain (but not all) modes of being carries it from past to future. Time is generated only because finite beings do not have the power and the control to hold themselves in the time- less present. Restlessness moves some beings away from Being's non-temporal center, although all beings are aware of their timeless core--every time their motion brings them across it and the insight of recognition occurs. Were this accepted, spirit would not in its essence appear in time'3 but in- stead would be revealed only in those present moments when the passage of time disappears. Time would not in itself reveal Being, but Being would be disclosed only through non-being, that is, in those moments in which it seems to bring itself to a halt. In the midst of the being of time, non-being is dis- closed. And following the stress on the centrality of non-being for the under- standing of Being, in the non-being of time which is discoverable at its center, is to be found the basis upon which Being may be understood and time given its proper place. In another work'4 Heidegger himself suggests that time produces itself only insofar as man is, so that there is no time where man is not. This being the case, God cannot be approached tem- porally without assuming that he shares man's structure, which from an exami- nation of man alone cannot be disclosed. Thus, where God is concerned it is particularly true that the approach via time faces a challenge, just as all meta- physical categories meet their severest test when God is described. Perhaps, as Hans Jonas suggests, "The understand- ing of God is not to be reduced to the self-understanding of man."'5 If, as Heidegger also suggests else- where,"6 being is questioned only as a means to induce the encounter with the complete other of being (the noth- ingness belonging to being), then per- haps we ought to investigate the sub- jective structure of man only in order to discover his non-being (although his being is overtly temporal in structure). It might be that man's non-being ap- pears in his relation to God, where time is eliminated and where the nothingness discovered in the divine nature exposes God's non-temporality and also man's. "Non-being and time" is a volume which cannot be written, except as a contrast, since it is non-being which discloses an absence of time. When Heidegger mentions the ex- perience of non-being (e.g., as it occurs in dread, which goes beyond concern), then if this is taken as the interpretive clue for the being of man, is time no longer Being's center? Would human nature then be more easily related to the divine, since the deepest religious experience is that of being "nothing" before God? Morally this is felt as unworthiness and, in Kierkegaard's phrase, to feel yourself against God as being "always in the wrong." How many possible modes of Being are there, and to how many is man's positive nature the key? If the core of Being is hidden and requires "disclosure" (to reborrow Heidegger's borrowed theological</page><page sequence="7">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 285 terms), then perhaps its center is not in the obvious place, that is, in its be- ing (its temporality), but in its non- being. The experience of non-being is illu- minating, but it is not to be described in temporal terms. Heidegger's famous radical question (Why is there any be- ing at all-why not rather nothing?)17 is much closer than time to disclosing Being, so that not time but its absence and the experience of non-being is the key to metaphysics. Heidegger has sug- gested this, but he has not begun a full-scale investigation of God from that starting point. Finite beings are dependent on in- tuition, which is essentially temporal,'8 but is our nature exclusively finite, or is the experience of non-being essen- tially a disclosure of our non-limited core (which is enough to frighten a being with only limited power of con- trol) ? The impact of non-being involves a non-temporal experience, one that removes us from sense intuition and opens Being to non-temporal under- standing. If Heidegger will allow this, then perhaps the being of man can generate a-temporality as well as time. Time limits us to the data of internal experience, but are we so confined? Or do we transcend our finite selves under the threat of non-being, understanding ourselves and Being in a moment of existential crisis in a way that the tem- poral sequence of life can never reveal? Is temporal thinking really as funda- mental to man as it casually appears, or is time only fundamental if we begin with an analysis of the world which has man as its center? Thought in its speculative aspect may have a time of its own, if indeed it is not out of all time. Yet such a specula- tive standpoint beyond time may in fact be the best vantage point from which to understand both being and time and man, so that the shock produced in an experience of the threat of non-being has its counterpart in the exhilaration of speculative thought that knows no restriction to time. The self then might not be temporal in its inmost essence,19 although it might appear so until the shell of the self is penetrated in an encounter with non-being. When the self is threatened, its core is disclosed and time will have a stop. Heidegger suggests this effect, but it is hard to see it as his starting point. When Heidegger does turn to con- sider God directly, he finds the notion of "cause of itself" most meaningful,20 but he sees this God as bringing thought to a halt. Such a God cannot be ap- proached with only a temporal frame- work, or else its effect upon thought will be to stop it. When man is not the object of the metaphysician's original preoccupation, this would seem to say -when a way is opened to consider God directfully-some of our anthro- pological prejudices must fall. Verbal thought must move (and so must phys- ical men), but, upon encountering such a notion of God, silence seems a more appropriate mode of thought. This "thinkingless-God" might per- haps be a better clue to Being's center than the restless, constantly moving thought of man. Can we begin, not end, metaphysics at this point-or, more properly, what mode of man's being can, if disclosed, lead us to such an understanding of God? Perhaps the psychic shock of an encounter with non-being, not the temporal regularity of experience in the world of beings, might be the primary data where God is concerned. What part of man's being leads to a disclosure of God's nature</page><page sequence="8">286 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION and is this an a-temporal core, and how might this explain the temporal and its relation to both God and man? Before passing on to the positive con- struction-which was our original aim -we should ask, in what sense have we discovered something new, or is this all "in Heidegger"? By way of reply we should note that the most fruitful opposition to a man lies not in saying yes where he said no. Philosophical disagreement is less blunt than that, but often you do find that to extend a direction actually opened by one man leads beyond him in the sense that there is a difference between starting where a man leaves off or ending with him. Taking a conclusion as a starting point can yield a new orientation, if carried far enough. Heidegger himself works toward the kind of approach suggested here, but that is not where he begins, which is the proposal here, nor can God be said to be his first in- terest. Have Heidegger's later sugges- tions made possible a new beginning, one considerably different from where Heidegger himself in fact began? If so, then we might start by considering God a-temporally, as it is clear Hei- degger does not. III We have now followed the third way which we first proposed and attempted neither a contextual understanding of Heidegger nor a clarification of his theoretical structure. Rather, we have made an effort to stumble across a new understanding of both time and God by "correcting" his structuring, follow- ing Heidegger's own leads. Reviewing and changing these, the hope is that some new combinations might provide a basis for speculative thought, one which it could not bring to full bloom from itself unaided. Metaphysics seeks to uncover first principles, but when it does it does not accept them. Instead, it produces new ones by challenging or going beyond the established structure it has just uncovered. "Understanding" means to discover the first principles in terms of which Being is grasped, but under- standing cannot stop "at the finish line"; it can sustain its original in- sight only if it moves on to recapture its vision by altering the previous struc- ture, often in ways suggested by the structure itself. Insight fades if not reworked, and following an identical route a second time never seems to have the stimulus required to induce vision twice. What has our "working beyond" Heidegger disclosed that no mere acquiesence to his structure could ac- complish nor Heidegger himself fully anticipate? The route Heidegger fol- lowed led to some of our insights, but we do not want to "go that route a second time"; we just want to start afresh. Since Heidegger discovered Being via time, it naturally comes to mind to ask whether another approach is open to us. If we are to find one, we must give special stress to some aspect of experience which impresses us as being a-temporal, outside of the temporal structure. The existential psychological exploration of crisis situations, when existence is threatened by an encounter with non-being producing anxiety and dread-these can appear as non-tem- poral, that is, set apart from Being and the on-going temporality of life, rather than being just part of its continuous process. These abnormal experiences provide</page><page sequence="9">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 287 a release from time, whereas average and regular experience is embraced by time. The unexpected releases us and proves to have a metaphysical and theological significance all out of pro- portion to its numerical weight among our experiences, although its psycho- logical impact is such that its weight in this respect is enormous. In the ex- periences which interrupt life and bring it to a sudden halt, we experience non- temporality (no past, no future, only present) and have open to us an ap- proach to Being without time as our starting point. We have come to question whether the self is always disclosed as temporal in its self-understanding, although it probably is in its dealings with the majority of its own experience and with inanimate objects. In certain revelatory personal encounters, the self enters a realm in which time is missing. Yet in addition to these crucial psychological experiences, and as a counterpart to them, the mind in its speculative em- ployment can operate out of relation to time. Mathematical entities, the con- sideration of possible modes of being-- in themselves these theoretical opera- tions do not accommodate to time, al- though time may be generated from their consideration, until the possible concrete embodiment of the speculative structure comes under consideration. As Kant pointed out, time may be gener- ated in the process of considering these entities, but it still may be that in them- selves their existence is not essentially temporal. In fact, it seems that some creative minds are employed more beyond time than in the temporal order, and all minds have at least a partial occupation out of time and understand the impor- tance of this exception to the temporal structures. There are then objects, and ways of knowing directed to them, which are not essentially temporal. Does any experience disclose to us a non-temporal way of knowing applica- ble to such entities? They have become increasingly important as the sciences have turned heavily theoretical and mathematics seems only partially con- cerned with the empirical world. Of course, it is possible to think this way, but can we ground it as a starting point for thought and use it to consider God? Perhaps Plato is right and knowledge is not accomplished until we escape from time. Perhaps it could be true that, although the mind concerns itself with temporal process, the mind still is not in its own being temporal. We would then have an existential psychology supporting a Platonic ontology. Per- haps phenomena are not primary but secondary as far as the mind's orienta- tion goes, and the mind actually has an initial orientation toward non-temporal entities (the possible modes of Being) and considers the particular embodi- ment of these only secondarily, at which point time enters experience. Do we ever consider non-temporal entities without relating them to tem- poral phenomena? The existentialists have given us psychological reasons for answering yes, in which case it might be that time is secondary even for thought, which neither Kant nor the Platonists considered, each for quite different reasons. If Being is under- stood only in the contrast provided by non-being, as encountered in an unusu- al experience that always comes as a shock and breaks the bond of time, then non-being can be primary and may yield a non-temporal approach to God.</page><page sequence="10">288 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Yet what if the mind is essentially temporarily oriented? Would it still be impossible for us to understand struc- tures whose ontological mode is basical- ly different from our own? Much of the time we assume that like can only know like, that if our mind is temporal, then its objects must be also. Perhaps this is not always true. Perhaps the mind lives by adapting to modes of being other than its own, in which case even its temporal bias would not preclude its grasp in knowledge of non-temporal modes. In fact, it could be that genuine knowledge takes place only when there is a shock produced by the contrast be- tween non-being and the modes of be- ing. Were all modes similarly constituted ontologically, then perhaps only the gathering of data would be possible and not the insight of knowledge. The mind records but does not reach and grasp, except when it is shocked from its basis by a violence of contrasts. The mind lives among modes of being, but comes to understand Being only in the con- trasting experience of non-being. The mind moves in time, but only achieves the insight of knowledge when it en- counters non-temporal modes of being and non-being. Non-temporal entities alone can make time real and awaken the understanding. If this is true, fol- lowing suggestions from a number of quarters, then it should make possible a new understanding of God. The stress upon time and the domi- nance of its structure derives from the subjective orientation which has preoc- cupied philosophy for several genera- tions. Kierkegaard, who is notorious for his stress upon the subjective approach, is aware that there is no subjective problem unless there is first of all an objective issue. In parallel fashion, we cannot be fully aware of time except in contrast to an awareness of non-tem- poral entities. Time, then, can only be partially understood internally. It is brought to full awareness through the experience of the non-temporal. The outlines of our human context do not become clear until a shock breaks us through, and we are aware of time's absence or end, which explains the existentialists' stress on the philo- sophical efficacy of death. When such a shattering encounter with non-being breaks in and takes us out of time, then we become painfully aware of time; but it is just as true that reflections upon such experiences might also simultane- ously reveal our grasp of and relation- ship to non-temporal modes of being. When time is "broken" it is finally un- derstood. Non-being is not against God, but opens Being and God to an under- standing not exclusively temporal. IV Modern philosophy has been plagued with an overdose of prolegomena and methodology. Have we committed the same sin here and spent all of our effort working up to God and too little on the systematic issue of time and its rela- tionship to a theory of the divine na- ture? I think not, for modern philoso- phy (e.g., Descartes) seemed absolute- ly certain about God and then spent exorbitant amounts of time preparing for what seemed to be the simplest is- sues. My proposal is to reverse that ra- tio, yet it is still true that God cannot be approached quickly. This is not due to religious restric- tions, but, because he is not discovera- ble in immediate sense experience, care- ful preparation must go on in order to be able to draw indirect inferences about his nature. Physicists never "see"</page><page sequence="11">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 289 an atom, but with elaborate apparatus they do "see" the results of their as- sault upon it. So with God such indirect techniques are also necessary. We be- gan with reorganizing Heidegger, hop- ing thereby to draw out a more helpful context within which to congeal an an- swer concerning God and time.What in- ferences are we now in a better position to make than we would have been if we had not started with Heidegger, at- tempting to draw from his suggestions a new starting place? Can God know directly a sequence in time without being temporal in his own nature? This is perhaps the most cru- cial question. And we now can give an answer: If time is not an all-embracing form which envelops all forms of ex- perience and all modes of being, but is instead merely a by-product of change, then (if like may know unlike, as we have argued) God can be directly aware of change and yet not necessarily be involved in that change himself. For this to be possible, it is true that God's knowing must be of a certain type, and this we will attempt to sketch briefly in the concluding section. He must en- compass within himself every possible mode and be aware of every possible combination, so that, when certain states are in fact actualized, he then knows the actual existence of what he always knew as possible. In this respect his knowledge changes, but this is not so extensive as to involve his nature in change too. God remains unchanged in his nature, and nothing new comes un- der his vision, except the knowledge that certain possibles are actualized for a time. Just as man needs the sharp contrast of the non-temporal in order to become fully aware of time, so God understands eternally because he also grasps fully how man understands in part in time. God understands himself as opposed to time, knowing it as his creation and un- derstanding himself as defined against it. Man begins in time, but understands himself as non-being lifts him from time and enables him to define himself as God does. Not by every temporal alteration but in the act of creation God alters himself. Yet the limitation in- volved in a specific creation is volun- tary and is an act which God freely takes upon himself. God observes change directly but is not himself changed directly, no new concept being added but only the awareness that something understood as simply possi- ble now actually exists. Although he did not know of this existence with certain- ty, he knew it as possible before man actualized it. Change is more basic than time, and God apprehenus factual change in his knowledge without himself being changed, so that he knows time in the objects of the world but not as within his own nature (except in his knowl- edge and in the act of creation and abrupt end). God may know time with- out being it. God has within himself the power which everything has to become, but this is not temporal, although the being which does become is. God knows the rules governing actualizing any combination of possibles, but not that they must exist in any one combination. This factor time adds, but it is not es- sentially new knowledge. Actualization for God cannot be the upsetting en- counter with an unknown as is often the case for man. Is time not really central, but simply a derivative of change ("passing away and coming to be")? Then in a being powerful enough to prevent this in his own nature (God), no time would be</page><page sequence="12">290 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION present, except in the knowledge of time as applicable to others. Time en- ters as a by-product into any nature which is without the power and the will to hold the elements of its being under decisive control and at rest, as God does. Non-being causes time to enter man's nature, and the experience of it can also remove him from time. Move- ment indicates loss of control and time is its manifestation, although it is not necessarily characteristic of Being it- self. God moved once in creation when his will concluded, and he can move again to halt the process (although Christians assert at least one additional intermedi- ate movement). Just as this decisive but once-and-for-all movement relates him to time, so God's knowledge of it is received without further alteration. Our acquired knowledge changes us, be- cause it often concerns modes of being not previously apprehended (which is never true of God), and because we are not powerful enough or fixed enough in will not to allow our nature to be al- tered by new knowledge. God can ab- sorb either new modes of being or the threat of non-being without essential change. What is presented to him as actual he eternally knows as possible. Such additional information might in- duce change in us, that is, produce time; God accepts without necessary response. If God can receive the knowledge of change impassively, we might be led to suspect one further essential feature in his nature: his mode of communication is silence. If silence and not conversa- tion or dialogue (of course, in our dia- logue man may speak God's part for him) is God's central characteristic, then he might neither speak in dialecti- cal sentences nor require time as cen- tral to his nature, or even as indigenous in our knowing relation to him. When God is most truly known, change, time, and all conversation cease, an experi- ence many mystics have reported. Change and time move around him but do not touch him, and God's silent core leaves man the maximum freedom for his own self-directed change. Silence is his answer to questions, and oddly enough a great many answers can be deduced from this important fact. Si- lence in response to our interrogation indicates just how different God's na- ture is from ours, so that we may now attempt to construct what these differ- ences would have to be. To know time and yet not to be in time, to understand changes which are not of his specific origination and yet not to be changed by this-we can now sketch out in what ways God would have to differ from man in order for this to be true. Plato came to see the importance of specifying non-being's relation to be- ing, and he found the two to be close and not far apart. Non-being has, when explored by the existentialists, shocked us out of time and made an understand- ing of a God who is different from man once again possible for us. Yet for this to be realized, non-being must have a crucial status in the divine nature itself. Psychologically we experience non-be- ing as real, but that is because man can change and pass out of existence. What about God and non-being? Since God's being involves all of the possible modes of being, of which only a small portion are actualized, any experience of the di- vine nature must feel and be impressed by the non-being of all the non-actual- ized possibles. Time does not itself ap- ply to God except in his knowledge of the actualized modes of being, since no change is present in the realm of the</page><page sequence="13">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 291 possibles. Man experiences God's na- ture as non-being in relation to his own human mode of being. Power and perfect will combine to such overwhelming proportions and stand in such violent contrast to God's silence that men seem swallowed up in non-being whenever they discover their own being's relation to God. To non-be- ing time cannot apply (except in its change into being). To the vast and si- lent wastelands of God's nature time is unreal and is not applicable. And in discovering this man can come to real- ize the rather limited applicability of time-a fact which he can discover from his own nature only in a state of crisis. Such psychological crisis can be induced by the human encounter most specifically with death, but it is also possible to meet it in the inbreaking of the vastness of the divine non-being, an experience human power is hardly ever equal to. To come up against this is to be changed in our mode of being and knowing. V What must God's nature be, if he is to be aware of change and time, under- standing them in their full temporal sense without himself being essentially temporal? This need not mean that God's mode of knowing is a-temporal, as sometimes has been argued, but his nature must include the changes which produce time and his understanding be able to follow them, without this char- acterizing his own mode of being. This is not the traditional eternal knowledge of temporal things but rather a way of allowing God to know temporally with- out his own being being so. Like man in knowing God, God requires an under- standing which can grasp modes of be- ing not its own, as they are, and with- out reducing them to himself. If man's understanding is the power to assume the form of its object without losing its identity as understanding, then God's knowing could assimilate to change, novelty, and contingency, assuming their form in understanding without be- ing like them in nature. God could know temporal events as they are with- out reducing them to non-temporality or necessity, without himself being tem- poral except in that sense of knowing. Kant has shown that we cannot even draw a line or move along it without generating time. Does God, then, gen- erate time in knowing the various rela- tionships among the possibles in his own nature, or in grasping in knowledge the contingent outcome of temporal events, as sketched above? To consider the later situation first, in following the course of those aspects in man and na- ture which are contingent and free, God does generate time in his understand- ing, but it does not cause movement in his nature, as it so often does for us. Not always or necessarily but on the whole our motion is generated by time as time is generated in our understand- ing, even when its object is so motion- less an entity as a number or a geo- metrical form. God's nature is powerful enough to hold firm against the tenden- cy to motion which the temporal move- ment of understanding produces. He may yield to it and act, but he may also hold his nature immune from the effects of time. Even granted that God may know contingent events temporally without necessarily having time infect his na- ture, what about the more difficult question? As God contemplates the ab- solute infinity of possibles in them- selves, not even bounded by the law of contradiction without its being imposed,</page><page sequence="14">292 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION as God contemplates these and their possible combination, does his under- standing generate time, and does time in this situation invade his nature? As we have already indicated, in knowing even the infinite timeless possible rela- tionships between all possible entities, God may-as traditionally conceived- take them all in simultaneously in his knowledge. Still, his knowing generates time within itself, since it accommo- dates itself to the possibles, and their nature is to assume connections in time, to the degree that their actual existence is also possible. But these objects are internal to God's nature. Does this spe- cial situation (the internal relationship) generate time in God's nature as well as in his understanding? It does in the sense that God is de- tached from the events actualized in time. Unless he intervenes, his relation- ship is simply that of accommodating his understanding to their contingent action. In his own nature, however, he is not detached from the possibles, so that a knowing of them and a calcula- tion of their various combinations for existence has a tendency to set his na- ture in motion, but his will and power are sufficient to contain this. He may release the motion, as his knowing gen- erates it, but he is not forced to, and he may hold his nature aloof to motion if he so desires. Now our original question returns: Is man capable of similar knowledge, not non-temporal in its generation in our understanding but only in its grasp of entities not themselves temporal and in our ability to grasp them without in- troducing motion and time into our na- ture? Yes, but not with the element of perfect control which God exercises. In conforming to non-temporal entities, our understanding generates time in the knowing of them, and most often the motion affects our nature. But at times it need not. Our mind moves, in its fol- lowing of relationships between possi- ble entities not in time, and not always but on certain occasions our under- standing may move but our nature will be held motionless in its grasp of non- temporal entities. As we have argued, this is made pos- sible primarily by the in-breaking of non-being. When concentrating on the modes of being, the release from time seems not possible, since most of these have entered the temporal sequence. God, in contemplating the possibles, is more aware of non-being than we are, and in that sense he is more released from time's motion. We are first im- pressed with the modes of being in time, but gradually certain events open our mind to the range of the possibles, or certain crisis experiences (such as facing death) bring our mind up against non-being. In his relation to the modes of being and non-being, God tends to be silent, speech requiring motion in time. We speak in relation to the actual- ized modes of being, but when faced with the possibles and the force of non- being our speech is at last reduced. When threatened in its existence our mind stops, and we grow silent. And, if we do not refuse to allow our minds to move, we may even learn something important while our nature is stopped in immobility. Heidegger has given some attention to modes of being other than dasein, that is, being not necessarily this or that. If such a mode of being is taken as more ultimate than that of a mathe- matical entity (or dasein), then we can see in this at least a degree of release from temporal structure. Not-being, everything a given form of being is not,</page><page sequence="15">HEIDEGGER, TIME, AND GOD 293 cannot be in time as dasein is. In fact, its very nature is that it is not involved in the temporal sequence as existence here and now is, and yet it is real. To focus on this is to see only one part of being as time-locked. Although the un- derstanding generates time in knowing any mode of being or not-being, the af- fect is different on the knower when the entity known is not itself in the temporal sequence. To know ourselves, as illuminated by nothingness, to see our nature as against all that it is not and its possibility not to be-that is to know ourselves as not essentially in time. Are alienation and anxiety the cru- cial experiences in which we are most forcefully aware of our temporality? Yes, that certainly is the first impres- sion; but we have argued that these al- so are the experiences which can release man from temporal bondage. How are both results possible? When non-being confronts us, our anxiety (or our alien- ation from self or others) makes us aware of the time-locked nature of our being. But to the extent that non-being opens possibility to us, we discern enti- ties-whether they are possible to our being or merely to some theoretical sys- tem-which are not in time. We are aware of our temporality as contrasted to all that is possible but not actually in being. Then, we may brood on our temporality, or we may be released from it into the not-being of the infinite possible modes of being, that confron- tation which first produced our existen- tial crisis. We exist in process and in question, but, when the question is radical enough, then process stops and ques- tions are suspended, precisely because we see that they were based only on our mode of being and must be reorganized to include all of not-being. To put our being in question reveals its temporal- ity, but, to stop it with the thought of death (or to confront it with all that it is not), this is to point up its non-tem- poral core. From this experience, the self swings either toward being stopped in time and bound to one moment, or toward release from temporal modes and toward a knowledge of time's lim- ited applicability to all that is possible but is not. Thus, time is limited in its application to God and to knowledge which is not provincial in its scope. Be- ing which is beyond what is this or that is not in its essence temporal, although the mind in knowing it may generate time in the movement of its grasp. Whenever we think, time is generated; but this is not the same as all thought and all possible entities being temporal. The shock induced by confrontation with non-being can freeze us to time or point up this fact, or it can release us from time's total dominance. If we have being as the absolutely infinite modes of all possible being, which includes a majority of non-being (modes which can never be), then if such entities are themselves non-tem- poral (except as the mind generates time in considering them and their pos- sible relationships), how is it possible for them to be connected as events in time? The first part of the answer to this crucial question is to note that in themselves they are defined by the pos- sible connections which they may have or not have with one another in any possible context of time. What cannot be connected out of time because of in- compatibilities cannot connect events in time (some of our failures are due to a failure to recognize when this is true). Those whose natures as possible enti- ties relate them in certain possible ways</page><page sequence="16">294 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to other entities and to modes of non- being, these also can be so connected in the same way in time, yet only with the degree of contingency and variety allowed. But of themselves, no possible or class of possibles enters or is con- nected in time. Will and power alone can add actuality, so that the connec- tion of events in time comes about be- cause the nature of possibility basically allows it, but more important it is be- cause will commits to them the power of actual existence. In following the connection between events in time, then, the mind may be aware of the addition of power given to the modes, and then it considers them as connected in time. But when proper- ly shocked from its preoccupation with actual being, non-being and sheer pos- sibility can free the mind to consider all modes of being and non-being as just what they are and not as necessar- ily in time. When we do this, then we follow a mode of thought which God used in selecting a world from among the possibles for creation. All abstract thought, whether in physics, mathemat- ics, or metaphysics, follows this form, although never in pure separation from time as God is able to do. When we can see precisely where and how and when and under what conditions time does and does not enter God's understanding or his nature, than in such a moment of insight-perhaps opened to us by crisis -God's nature can be seen and man's nature clarified. The philosopher's re- action to this is to speak as precisely as he can; God's reply is silence. Time does not dictate to him, and he does not have to talk his way out of bondage. NOTES 1.
