<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3the anthropocene, the posthuman,   and the animal the anthropocene, the posthuman, and the animal We’ve just opened the great big gene-splicing toy box and  people are going to be playing with that for years. (Margaret  atwood, cited in Halliwell 260) as has been discussed in the last chapter, biopunk is firmly rooted in a  variety of socio-political discourses, from globalization to posthumanism  to technoscience. With its heritage in cyberpunk, itself a subgenre of  science fiction and a cousin (closely related) to the utopian/dystopian  tradition, it seems only sensible to begin an analysis of biopunk with  the ‘original’ medium from which the formation was born: literature.  Within the cultural formation, literary works represent a strong  connection not only to the sf genre tradition, but to biological sf, to  dystopian critique, and to social commentary. the contemporary public  interest in genetics and the posthuman can be noticed not just within  the core of the genre, with its hard sf ecocriticism and vivid extrapo- lations of hybrid post humanity, but also at the fuzzier edges, where  delegates of the high cultural elite pick up on its themes and issues. in  this chapter, i will thus provide posthumanist readings of two recent  literary works that extrapolate from a liquid modern present, exploring  its dystopian dimension and leading towards a posthuman future as  critical utopian alternatives. i have chosen two authors and their works  that could be argued to assume peripheral and central positions within  the spectrum of sf respectively. on the one end, Margaret atwood’s recently completed Maddaddam  trilogy (Oryx and Crake [2003], The Year of the Flood [2009], and  MaddAddam [2013]) functions as a liminal work on the demarcation line  between ‘literary’ and ‘genre’ fiction. atwood herself has been instru- mental in the demarcation, insisting on her work being ‘speculative  fiction’ rather than ‘science fiction proper’ (‘My Life’ 159). i do not wish  71 </page> <page sequence="2"> 72 Biopunk Dystopias to engage in the genre debate and will for the purpose of this study simply  repeat contemporary genre theory in that genre status is continuously  negotiated by ‘communities of practice’ (Rieder 201) and that large  parts of the reading community have deemed the Maddaddam trilogy  to be ‘science fiction’ and possibly even ‘biopunk’ (as witnessed in the  original inclusion of the first two books in the Wikipedia entry [removed  in 2010]). Further, her trilogy, which combines science-fictional tropes  with realistic narrative technique, has been analyzed excessively by  literary scholars and debated in regard to a variety of topics – satire  and humor, religion and myth, ecology, capitalism, technology, writing,  and many more.1 in the following, i will approach the novels as literary interventions  in the current debate on posthumanism and for that purpose contrast  atwood’s work with that of another sf writer: paolo Bacigalupi. Whereas  atwood tries to avoid the label of ‘science fiction’ and thus represents the  fringe of the genre that would rather appear as a mainstream literary  form, Bacigalupi is firmly established in its center. His short stories and  novels have garnered virtually every award sf has to offer – the debut  novel The Windup Girl (2009) alone won the Hugo, Campbell, nebula  and Locus awards and has in its impact on the genre been compared  to Gibson’s Neuromancer (see Hageman 187). posthumanism plays a role  in most of Bacigalupi’s work, but for the purpose of my analysis, i will  concentrate on The Windup Girl and two related short stories, ‘the Calorie  Man’ and ‘the yellow Card Man’ (both from Pump Six and Other Stories  [2008]), that are part of the same fictional universe and reference the  same posthuman beings.2 What brings atwood and Bacigalupi together is the imagination of  a critical dystopian future, extrapolated from our contemporary liquid  modernity, in which the posthuman has become a tangible reality that   1 a full discussion of the secondary material available would go beyond the  scope of this chapter – at the moment there are more than 100 articles and  book chapters discussing the first two novels in the series. some examples  will need to suffice: satire (Dunning; Dvorak; Hume), religion (Hengen;  Hoogheem; osborne), ecology (Bergthaller; Canavan; Dunlap; Rozelle),  capitalism (Davey; Hall), technology (Cooke; DiMarco), and writing (Cole;  storey and storey).  2 Both stories have been collected by Bacigalupi’s publishers night shade  Books under the title Windup Stories as an eBook. the subtitle is ‘stories  from the World of The Windup Girl.’ i will use the term ‘Windup stories’ to  mean the fictional universe that includes the novel and the short stories.  page numbers for the short stories refer to their publication in Pump Six,  not in the eBook. </page> <page sequence="3"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 73 is trying to establish a position in the ‘natural order’ and ultimately  ends up threatening to replace the human completely. Both scenarios  establish a world of rampant capitalism, of individualistic consumer  societies, leading to a global ecological catastrophe, the development  of transgenic species (across all biological domains), and ultimately the  creation of a rival species of posthumans. in Bacigalupi’s The Windup Girl the world has undergone drastic  economic, political, and ecological changes. after a period of ‘Expansion,’  energy production through fossil fuels collapsed completely, leading to  a worldwide economic ‘Contraction’ period: Global transport, industrial  production, computing, and high-speed communication have become  impossible to maintain and energy necessarily needs to be produced  manually. During the Expansion, genetic engineering technology has  created corporate interest in food patenting. this lead to food wars,  in which so-called ‘calorie companies’ created plagues and pests that  destroyed unpatented food, so that they could then distribute their  own disease-resistant strains of the same food for large profits. Global  warming caused sea levels to rise and the planet’s environment was  almost destroyed. the novel takes place in thailand after the Contraction,  when the economy is slowly recovering. thailand is one of very few  remaining independent nation states that resisted the calorie companies  due to strictly and violently enforced trade laws and the reliance on  a genetic seed bank as a national treasure. the plot revolves around  anderson Lake, a calorie man, a secret trader for the global calorie  companies, trying to get his hands on the seed bank and on the renegade  geneticist that helps to develop new and secure food sources for thailand.  at the same time, an internal struggle for power erupts in an outright  war between the two largest ministries (trade and Environment),  determining the future of the thai kingdom and sweeping up all of the  novel’s characters in its chaos. atwood’s trilogy deals with a similarly devastated near future in  which climate change made large parts of the earth uninhabitable:  temperatures and sea levels rose, fertile lands became deserts and  humanity’s energy hunger depleted most natural resources. the elite  population now lives in class-segregated communities (‘Compounds’) and  revels in bacchanalian ignorance and consumption, while the masses  barely survive in squalor (‘pleeblands’) and constant fear of disease,  crime, and natural catastrophe. nation states have given way to global  corporate rule, and especially biotechnological progress and its capitalist  consumption have had a major impact on society and environment. But  this corporate rule ends when the renegade scientist Crake (a codename  derived from an extinct species) genetically engineers a plague that wipes  </page> <page sequence="4"> 74 Biopunk Dystopias out humanity, which he sees as faulty and destructive. as an alternative  to the human species, Crake creates a race of posthumans (referred to  as the Children of Crake, or Crakers) that after the demise of the faulty  species is supposed to repopulate the earth. Oryx and Crake portrays both the pre- and the post-apocalyptic world  through the eyes of Jimmy, a childhood friend of Crake’s who becomes  a pawn in Crake’s god game and is spared, to witness the extinction  of his world. as snowman (Jimmy’s self-chosen codename), the ‘last  man on earth’ (or so he believes) then becomes guardian and spiritual  guide for the Crakers, leading them into the future, mourning for the  loss of humanity. But the novel ends with snowman finding three other  human survivors and pondering what to do. The Year of the Flood is not a sequel but a parallel narration that adds  a different perspective to the same events. Whereas Oryx dealt with  the male, privileged perspective of the Compounds, Year now interjects  with the female, precarious perspective of the pleeblands. Focusing on  the story of toby and Ren, two female members of the eco-religious  God’s Gardeners group, which offers an alternative to the corporate,  exploitative lifestyle of the Compounds, the novel again portrays the  events leading up to the plague, as well as how the women survive after  the plague. in the end, both women end up with a group of former  Gardeners and geneticists called Maddaddam that separated from the  religious group and formed an anti-corporate bioterrorist cell, which is  mainly responsible for the genetic work on the Crakers, blackmailed  by Crake into compliance with his plans. the novel ends with toby  and Ren searching for another ex-Gardener, amanda, who has been  kidnapped by two surviving painballers, brutal escaped convicts. they  find all three at the beach, when suddenly snowman appears on the  scene. MaddAddam, the third book in the series, then finally offers a real  sequel to the events of Oryx. Beginning with the encounter between  snowman, the painballers, and the ex-Gardeners, Madd relates the story  of the creation of a new community that includes the ex-Gardeners,  the Maddaddamites, and the Crakers, as well as their ultimate defense  against the escaped painballers. the post-apocalyptic narration is again  interlaced with stories from pre-apocalyptic times, this time from the  perspective of Zeb, the leader of Maddaddam and brother to the founder  of the Gardeners, filling in many of the gaps the two former novels left  open on how the Gardeners came to be and how deep their involvement  with Crake was. the novel ends with a showdown with the painballers  and a hopeful look towards a future community with all survivors of  the plague, both human and posthuman. </page> <page sequence="5"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 75 in the following, i will show that in both fictional worlds, the idea of  the ‘human’ is under attack by liquid modern realities, losing its categorial  integrity through corporate manipulation and environ mental influences.  atwood and Bacigalupi, in their works, undermine concepts of human  exceptionalism, question the ontological stability of biological categories,  and reveal a belief in the interconnectedness of all life on the planet. in  both works, the human is reduced by hypercapitalism to become inhuman,  non-human animals are introduced to showcase categorial liminality – if  not outright transgression – and to reveal the interrelated ness of species,  and finally the ‘posthuman’ is staged as an alternative category better  equipped to prosper in the post-catastrophic environment, having to  negotiate its position in regard to the still-existent ‘human.’ 3.1 Eco-Catastrophe, Hypercapitalism, and the Inhuman What unites the works of atwood and Bacigalupi is the protean nature  of their diegetic worlds and the ecological catastrophe as a catalyst for  changes in the concept of the posthuman. the Maddaddam trilogy and  the Windup stories discuss the shifting economic and ecological realities  of their respective worlds. Both worlds have undergone ecological change  due to rampant and unrestrained capitalism. in this, both fictional  universes are extreme extrapolations of Bauman’s liquid modernity  where consumption becomes the only and all-encompassing urge that  drives society. in both worlds, then, hypercapitalism has brought about a commodi- fication of any and all life on earth, which in turn has led to an  acceleration of ‘global change’ within the anthropocene, as defined by  Will steffen, paul Crutzen, and John Mcneill: We use the term global change to mean both the biophysical  and the socio economic changes that are altering the structure  and the functioning of the Earth system. Global change includes  alterations in a wide range of global-scale phenomena: land use  and land cover, urbanisation, globalisation, coastal ecosystems,  atmospheric composition, riverine flow, nitrogen cycle, carbon  cycle, physical climate, marine food chains, biological diversity,  population, economy, resource use, energy, transport, communi- cation, and so on. (615) For the national Research Council, human activity enacting these global  changes ‘could eventually lead to a “crisis in the biosphere”’ (cited in  </page> <page sequence="6"> 76 Biopunk Dystopias steffen, Grinevald et al. 843) – could lead to a dystopian vision such  as the ones imagined in both the Maddaddam trilogy and the Windup  stories. there are boundaries to human action that should not be crossed,  Crispin tickell argues, and he names nine scientific stops that humanity  should note and respect. in atwood’s and Bacigalupi’s universes, several  of these stops have been ignored; tickell mentions that we have already  experienced the results of ‘climate change’ and ‘loss of biodiversity,’  and are on the way to cross further scientific boundaries, such as  ‘oceanic acidification,’ ‘changes in land use,’ or ‘chemical pollution’  (927). More to the point, though, he argues, underlying the scientific  changes brought about by the anthropocene are ‘six more general ones  where the societal responses are critical’ (927) – six aspects of the  liquid modern world the human species needs to realize are destructive  and need to change: First we need to confront the effects of our own proliferation in  all its aspects; next to look again at a lot of economics and replace  consumerism as a goal; then to work out new ways of generating  energy; to manage and adapt to what is in effect climate destabili- zation; to give higher priority to conservation of the natural world;  and last to create the necessary institutional means of coping with  global problems in a world in which society is more joined together  than ever before. (927) in the Maddaddam trilogy, the world has become uninhabitable due to  climate change, but atwood only mentions the consequences in passing.  in Oryx, snowman wakes up on the beach, looking out towards the  ocean where the ‘offshore towers stand out in dark silhouette [...] the  distant ocean grinding against the ersatz reefs of rusted car parts and  jumbled bricks and assorted rubble’ (5). the scene shows the result of  rising sea levels due to global warming: ‘the coastal aquifers turned salty  and the northern permafrost melted and [...] the asian steppes turned  to sand dunes’ (29). similarly, Year speaks of ‘the big drought’ hitting  the ‘Wisconsin desert’ (56), ‘the southern shores of the Mediterranean  – once fruitful farmland, now a desert,’ and the ‘wholesale slaughter  of ecosystems’ (90) that haunts the planet. toby thinks back on her  youth and reflects a realization everyone had, but no one talked about:  ‘We’re using up the Earth. It’s almost gone’ (Year 239). Jimmy, as Hannes  Bergthaller argues, ‘is presented as symptomatic for the larger failure of  his culture to tame the destructive appetites of its members’ (733). He  watches the world fall apart from the security of his Compound: ‘more  </page> <page sequence="7"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 77 plagues, more famines, more floods, more insect or microbe or small- mammal outbreaks, more droughts, more chickenshit boy-soldier wars in  distant countries. Why was everything so much like itself?’ (Oryx 307). atwood further focuses her world around the aspect of the prolif- eration of the human species in consumer society – satirically proposing a  radical break with the human as the only option to stop the destruction  of the environment. With dwindling natural resources and the continued  ecological exploitation of the earth, Crake argues, humanity is doomed:  ‘you can’t couple a minimum access to food with an expanding  population indefinitely. Homo sapiens doesn’t seem able to cut himself  off at the supply end. He’s one of the few species that doesn’t limit  reproduction in the face of dwindling resources. in other words – and  up to a point, of course – the less we eat, the more we fuck’ (Oryx  145). Humanity, the argument goes, will not learn and stop by itself –  self-imposed discipline is impossible. Consequently, Bergthaller states, Jimmy’s world is one of corporate  greed and full-fledged consumption, which has ‘given up any pretence  of disciplining people’s desires. instead, it has instated their stimulation  and gratification as the central object of the social order’ (733). it is,  in effect, the extreme version of what Bauman describes as liquid  modernity: nation states do not exist anymore; instead an extreme form  of ‘corpocracy’ (appleton 64) rules a consumer society with an eye for  maximizing their profit margins, replacing any ethical decision-making.  Central to this rampant hypercapitalism is a shift from producing  material goods to providing services for the consumer (as product)  him- or herself, especially in regard to physical health. as Bauman notes,  ‘the human body is in most cases far from perfect, and therefore needs  to be tinkered and tampered with to help it to improve or force it to  meet to the desired standards’ (44 Letters 58). Health as a personal goal  is being replaced by fitness and beauty – two standards that can easily  be manipulated, so that customers can constantly be kept in need of  more services. Bauman goes further and describes the creation of ever  higher standards in order to increase profits: ‘demand must be created  for commodities already launched on the market, thereby following  the logic of a commercial company in search of profit, rather than the  logic of human needs in search of satisfaction’ (44 Letters 76, original  in italics). Corporations will generate a demand for the products, even  if it means inventing a specific lack of health – Bauman’s example is  ‘eyelash hypotrichosis’ (44 Letters 58), eyelashes that are too short and  not dense enough for contemporary beauty standards, which makes them  the target of corporate marketing. instead of natural variety, these short  eyelashes now become a medical condition in need of cure. </page> <page sequence="8"> 78 Biopunk Dystopias in atwood’s fiction this logic becomes even darker and more  twisted, as corporations not only provide health and beauty services  (satirically reflected in their brand names: ‘HelthWyzer,’ ‘anooyoo,’  and ‘RejoovenEsense’), making their clientele feel the need for wellness  treatments and beauty enhancers. Rather, corporations turn back to  health as an option for creating demand where none has been, an  ‘economics of scarcity’: ‘“the best diseases, from a business point  of view,” said Crake, “would be those that cause lingering illnesses.  ideally – that is, for maximum profit – the patient should either get  well or die just before all of his or her money runs out. it’s a fine  calculation”’ (Oryx 256). in Year, the devastating consequence of this  logic is demonstrated on toby’s mother, who becomes ill, is being  treated by HelthWyzer, and then finally dies, just after the family’s  money has run out (25–26). the corporate machine works flawlessly, as  sarah appleton remarks: ‘instead of relying on supply and demand, the  corporations have created artificial demands and promoted engineered  dependencies. Manufactured diseases necessitate manufactured cures;  body enhancements need to be maintained with age’ (71). Bacigalupi’s world is similarly broken: Here climate change also  caused sea levels to rise, making it necessary to build ‘dikes and levees’  (Windup 121) to prevent Bangkok from being drowned. Further, the  exhaustion of energy resources has left the remaining civilization ruined:  ‘the wrecked tower bones of the old Expansion’ (Windup 60) dominating  the skyline of the city and high-rises now nothing more than slums  ruled by the Dung Lord and inhabited by thousands of refugees – ‘a  remnant glory from the old energy Expansion now become a heated  tropic coffin without air conditioning or electricity to protect it from  the glaze of the equatorial sun’ (Pump Six 164). But more destructive  than the climate, hypercapitalist greed is responsible for the destruction  of the earth in this world too. Consumer society still remains and is  responsible for shaping the political landscape in most parts of the world  into a ‘corpocracy.’ instead of the health and beauty corporations, Bacigalupi’s ruling  powers are ‘calorie companies’ (Windup 6) though, engineering and  patenting food sources: in a first step, calorie companies produced  genetically altered seeds, ‘so perfect from a CEo’s perspective’ because  they were sterile: ‘a genetic dead-end. a one-way street. We now pay  for a privilege that nature once provided willingly, for just a little  labor’ (Pump Six 114). in a second step, they then created diseases and  plagues that wiped out the non-patented (and thus not genetically  secured) versions of the food: ‘cibiscosis 111.b, c, d; fa’gan fringe; bitter  water mussels and their viral mutations [...] blister rust’ (Windup  </page> <page sequence="9"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 79 121). unfortunately, the diseases mutated, wiped out the earth’s food  supply, and forced the calorie companies to re-engineer their product  constantly: ‘if the world is going to keep eating, we need to stay ahead  of cibiscosis and blister rust and nippon genehack weevil. it’s the only  way’ (Windup 151). Calorie companies wield the sterile and secure  versions of ‘totalnutrient Wheat,’ ‘soypro,’ and ‘HiGro Corn’ (Windup  6) as political weapons, eliminating nation states when they oppose  them – only thailand retains its independence due to the existence of  a secret seed bank, ‘while countries like india and Burma and Vietnam  all fall like dominoes, starving and begging for the scientific advances  of the calorie monopolies’ (Windup 3). in terms of tickell’s societal stops, the world of the Windup stories  focuses not so much on over-population but rather on energy resources  and their depletion, a topic, Bacigalupi argues, that garners too little  interest from sf, as it should not simply be ‘window-dressing’ but rather  feature ‘as a major component of the story’: ‘Where does energy come  from? Where does the food come from? [...] We have a perception of  post-scarcity already. and that problem is rife in sf. i’d like sf to touch  on those questions – it will inform the society we’ll build and the  objects we’ll build in the future’ (cited in newitz, ‘paolo Bacigalupi’).  His world is dominated by energy production after the deple tion of fossil  fuels, returned to a state as it was before the anthropocene: ‘energy  needed to animate human society came from muscle – human and  other animal muscle – and management of water and wind’ (tickell  929). in order to keep society running, ‘kink-springs’ (Windup 5) need  to be wound through muscle power as ‘batteries’ for trans portation and  production – a world where any calorie spent as energy finds painstaking  correspondence in a calorie eaten. But most poignantly, both atwood’s and Bacigalupi’s dystopian  views also reveal the hypercapitalist exploitation of human life, which  transforms the human into the inhuman. Foreshadowed in Bauman’s  liquid modern consumer society, these dystopias transform even life  and death into commodities. Justified by a system of ‘development,’ as  Jean-François Lyotard famously called it, ‘political and socioeconomic  decision-maker[s]’ can legitimate any measure to ensure the systemic  continuation of, for example, ‘competitiveness’ (5). Within this system,  development takes precedence over anything; development itself – as  an end, not a means – ‘is reproduced by accelerating and extending  itself according to its internal dynamic alone’ (7). the human, Lyotard  argues, is ‘in the process of, constrained into, becoming inhuman’ (2),  irrelevant as the system perpetuates itself. in the Maddaddam trilogy, for example, the human body becomes  </page> <page sequence="10"> 80 Biopunk Dystopias commodified through genetics. the elite, living in the Compounds,  objectify the human body not just by shaping their own bodies, through  wellness and beauty treatments, but also by specifying parameters for  their offspring, creating made-to-order children via genetic agencies:  ‘infantade, Foetility, perfectababe, one of those [...] they’d have a few  trial runs, and if the kids from those didn’t measure up they’d recycle  them for the parts, until at last they got something that fit all their  specs’ (Oryx 302). Even more tangibly, the human body becomes a source of entertainment  for the rich by consuming it as desired in sexual services, such as those  exemplified in oryx, whom Crake encounters as part of his university’s  ‘student services,’ ‘trained professionals’ that provide sex to students  that do not wish for ‘pair-bonding’ (Oryx 252). Further, intimacy is  devalued by making private human acts publicly accessible – sexually  through varied internet porn sites such as ‘Hotttotts,’ ‘tart of the  Day,’ or ‘super swallowers’ (Oryx 107), but also existentially in websites  that commodify death, such as ‘shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and  deathrowlive.com [...] they showed electrocutions and lethal injections,’  or ‘nitee-nite.com’ (Oryx 100–01), a website glorifying the suicide of  people desperate for attention. at some point snowman ponders how  society could become so fixated on the body, ignoring soul and mind  in finding pleasure and instant gratification, no abstract cultural forms  (literature, art) necessary: ‘But the body had its own cultural forms.  it had its own art. Executions were its tragedies, pornography was its  romance’ (Oryx 102). But the inhuman shows even stronger in the commodification of the  body as a resource for product testing. the pleeblands, as Crake explains,  ‘were a giant petri dish: a lot of guck and contagious plasm got spread  around there’ (Oryx 346), and he himself uses the pleebs’ sex clinics  and brothels to test his pleasure pill: ‘scales was testing the Blysspluss  for the ReJoov Corp, so they weren’t handing it out like candy – it was  mostly for the top customers’ (Year 130). in the pleeblands, the body can even be reduced to meat for  consumption. in times of food scarcity, when ‘meat was hard to come  by’ (Oryx 29), the fast-food chain ‘secretBurgers’ is not squeamish about  procuring their meat: ‘no one knew what sort of animal protein was  actually in them’ (Year 33). secretBurgers recycles street animals and  even humans: ‘the local pleebmobs [...] ran corpse disposals, harvesting  organs for transplant, then running the gutted carcasses through the  secretBurgers grinders’ (Year 33). and even the rest of the body can be  harvested through such an inhuman system, as the ‘garboil’ dumpsters  prove, which can be found anywhere in the pleeblands: </page> <page sequence="11"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 81 Carbon garboil was made from any sort of carbon garbage — slaugh- terhouse refuse, old vegetables, restaurant tossout, even plastic  bottles. the carbs went into a boiler, and oil and water came out,  plus anything metal. officially you couldn’t put in human corpses,  but the kids made jokes about that. oil, water, and shirt buttons.  oil, water, and gold pen nibs. (Year 76) in Bacigalupi’s Windup stories, a similar system of recycling and  composting exists, but (so far) human beings are not processed in  these, unlike the genetically created animals and posthumans that can  be found in thailand. Emiko, a genetically engineered posthuman, a  so-called ‘Windup,’ reflects her status as energy source: ‘she is a creature  forbidden to them. the thai men would happily mulch her in their  methane composting pools. if they met her or an agriGen calorie man,  it is hard to say which they would rather see mulched first’ (Windup  37). the reference to the calorie man, a similarly illegal invader of  thailand, though entirely human, here indicates the inhuman system,  which would see no calorie of energy wasted. the use of genetically  altered creatures in energy recycling might feel just as inhuman, but  shall be analyzed separately below. More overtly constraining the human in the system of development  in Bacigalupi’s fiction is the treatment of refugees as cheap and entirely  inhuman tools for labor in the thai kingdom. after a racially and  religiously motivated genocide in the neighboring Malaysia has led tens  of thousands of Malaysian Chinese refugees to flee to thailand, the  so-called ‘yellow cards’ have become a class of subhumans. they live in  the ruined skyscrapers of former glory, stacking bodies to the thousands  in stairwells, offices, and apartments, or in slums cobbled together from  scrap wood and old tarps: ‘Certainly it is better than the Expansion  tower internments of the yellow cards. a tarp slum is luxury for him’  (Windup 69). Denied access to official work, they are either forced to  steal and cheat (‘another refugee forbidden from feeding herself except  by wits and clever machinations’; Windup 24) or are exploited for simple  work – eating enough calories so that they can prove their worth in  energy: ‘and yet still they try to look vital, try to show that their bony  limbs have calories to spare, if only someone will allow them to burn’  (Windup 134). yellow card calories wind kink-springs or haul goods,  but their bodies are worth nothing, when their capacity to spend the  energy stored in them is gone. in ‘the yellow Card Man,’ tranh works  unloading potato sacks when an accident shatters his knee and kills Hu,  his co-worker. His employer is more upset about him than about the  dead man, quickly discharging tranh and hiring ‘a young man, fresh  </page> <page sequence="12"> 82 Biopunk Dystopias and grinning’: ‘the manager looks back at tranh with pity, then glances  at Hu’s body and shrugs. it is an easy acquiescence. Hu will demand no  reparations’ (Pump Six 188). How reductive that systemic view of human bodies as potential  sources of energy really is becomes clear in The Windup Girl when the  yellow card Hock seng visits the Dung Lord, a shady mobster living in  luxury by exploiting the labor of yellow cards. the Dung Lord lives in  a skyscraper, which still has an operational elevator, powered by the  calories of human bodies: ‘[the man] is whisked up into darkness. a  minute later, ballast men slide into view in the secondary shaft. they  squeeze out of the lift and dash for the stairwell in a herd’ (Windup  135). the human body is reduced to weight and calories – no more than  a commodity available in superfluous amounts. as i have shown, in both atwood’s Maddaddam trilogy and  Bacigalupi’s Windup stories, all life has become a commodity for  hypercapitalist consumption and is employed to further corporate  interests. in this, both fictional worlds are extrapolations of Bauman’s  concept of consumer society within liquid modernity. But neither  atwood nor Bacigalupi arrests their dystopian vision there. in both  cases, capitalist ingenuity goes further than simply exploiting existing  nature – it rather creates new forms of genetic hybrids, designed for  specific purposes. 3.2 Interconnectedness, the Animal Other, and Genetics the figure of the animal, Cary Wolfe notes, has been part of (Western)  cultural history going back at least to ancient Greece and Egypt,  functioning as reminder and reflector of ‘the constitutive disavowals  and self-constructing narratives enacted by that fantasy figure called  “the human”’ (Animal Rites 6). ‘the animal’ has long been other to  the construction of ‘the human,’ and as Wolfe further argues, the  ‘transcendence of the “human” requires the sacrifice of the “animal” and  the animalistic’ (Animal Rites 6) – resulting in the institutionalization  of speciesism within Enlightenment humanist thought. in a similar  vein of argument, Jacques Derrida sees the human as participant in an  ‘unprecedented transformation’ (392) of human–animal relations that  began 200 years ago but continues to intensify and accelerate even  now. in a continuous process of development (Lyotard’s concept seems  somewhat appropriate at this point) ‘the human’ has radically upended  the ‘traditional forms of treatment of the animal’ for sacrifice, food,  ‘domestication,’ or ‘exploitation of [...] energy’ (Derrida 394) through  </page> <page sequence="13"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 83 scientific progress and technological innovation. Derrida argues that  through development, ‘we’ have transformed the concept of what an  animal is: this has occurred by means of farming and regimentalization at  a demographic level unknown in the past, by means of genetic  experimentation, the industrialization of what can be called the  production for consumption of animal meat, artificial insemination  on a massive scale, more and more audacious manipulations of the  genome, the reduction of the animal not only to production and  over active reproduction (hormones, genetic crossbreeding, cloning,  and so on) of meat for consumption but also of all sorts of other  end products, and all of that in the service of a certain being and  the so-called human well-being of man. (Derrida 394) in the extrapolation of this ‘transformative process’ into the transgenic  creation of new hybrid species, both atwood and Bacigalupi engage in  the debate on human exceptionalism and speciesism by on the one hand  blurring the distinctive lines of species discourse and on the other hand  disclosing a deep interconnectedness of all life on earth. Within the  systemic thought of such dystopian hypercapitalist societies, both authors  reveal that liberal humanist technoscience sees animals simply as ‘parts  of human economic constellations and human-centered ecosystems:  they are economic resources, commodities and means of production for  human use’ (noske 185). Life thus simply becomes a mechanical object  to be manipulated and changed according to the needs of superior and  exceptional ‘man’ – with all its horrible consequences for an intrinsic  ethical value of life: a nature represented in mechanistic terms as inferior, passive  and mindless, whose only value and meaning is derived from the  imposition of human ends, is simply replaceable by anything else  which can serve those ends equally well – it can be reduced and  regimented [...] as you wipe out one species of fish, it can be  replaced with another, in theory without limit. (plumwood 49) 3.2.1 Animal Engineering for Human Use Both atwood’s Maddaddam trilogy and Bacigalupi’s Windup stories  challenge this mechanistic reduction of life to a replaceable function  within the anthropological order (Warkentin 86) by introducing  transgenic species into their fictional universes that have surpassed their  </page> <page sequence="14"> 84 Biopunk Dystopias genetic programming and proven to be rather adaptive. in both worlds,  new species of animals are genetically engineered to answer specific  needs within human culture that other animals could not provide for.  some of these species are harmless and ‘function’ according to their  specified parameters: in atwood’s fiction, for example, the Mo’Hair sheep  created with long colorful hair to provide humans with artificial hair  extensions do not interfere with nature and indeed live harmoniously  with their conventional brethren, even though they are not meant to  be part of wildlife: ‘the long hair of the Mo’Hairs isn’t in good shape   – there are clot-like snarls in it, and twigs and dry leaves. onscreen, in  advertisements, their hair had been shiny [...] But they’re not faring so  well without their salon treatments’ (Year 238). atwood actually engages  in literary experimentation with these critters, providing the world of  her trilogy with a complete ‘“surreal zoo” of transgenic species’ (Bouson  140). aside from the Mo’Hairs, other rather harmless beings include  the rakunk – a splice between skunk and raccoon, created as a pet,  ‘a clean animal, with a nice disposition’ (Oryx 60); the kanga-lamb –  designed as a food source, ‘a new australian splice that combined the  placid character and high-protein yield of the sheep with the kangaroo’s  resistance to disease’ (Oryx 352); glow-in-the-dark bunnies (just like  Eduardo kac’s ‘alba’); and butterflies with ‘wings the size of pancakes  [...] [in] shocking pink’ (Oryx 252). similarly, in Bacigalupi’s world, genetically designed beings exist that  are created for specific purposes and do not interfere with the ‘natural’  order. For example, engineered ‘megodonts,’ ‘fifteen feet at the shoulder,  ten tons of muscle’ (Windup 17), are used to provide all necessary  power for transportation and production of material goods: ‘the massive  creatures barely resembled the elephants that had once provided their  template Dna. Generippers had honed them to a perfect balance of  musculature and hunger for a single purpose: to inhale calories and  do terrible labors without complaint’ (Pump Six 102). Further, there are  genetically engineered sniffer dogs that signal the presence of forbidden  materials (like illegal seeds) via their fur: ‘it snuffled his clothing, bared  hungry teeth, snuffled again, then its black ruff iridesced blue and it  relaxed and wagged its stubby tail’ (Pump Six 99). interestingly, these  creatures are not marked by the narrative, but function as ‘genetic  window-dressing,’ in atwood’s case to satirically signal the possibilities  of splicing, in Bacigalupi’s case to illustrate aspects of necessity in his  energy-scarce world. though they are not part of any natural habitat,  they are nonetheless harmlessly integrated into both natural and anthro- pological order – they have an economic purpose, which they fulfill  without larger complications to nature or man. </page> <page sequence="15"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 85 3.2.2 Invasive Species and the Environmental Cost some species, though, are more adaptive and surpass the original intent  for their genetic programming by far – thus becoming a human-made  form of evolutionary intervention, as Bacigalupi argues for his world’s  neo-felines: ‘Cheshires were a way to illustrate the unforeseen  consequences of an invasive species. something that initially seems  harmless and entertaining turns out to have ecosystem consequences  as it tears through the songbird population’ (cited in Vorda 17). in his  stories, Bacigalupi’s cheshires function as a reminder that human hubris  and curiosity will lead to unforeseen side effects: Hock seng has heard that cheshires were supposedly created by a  calorie executive – some purCal or agriGen man, most likely – for a  daughter’s birthday. a party favor for when the little princess turned  as old as Lewis Carroll’s alice. the child guests took their new pets  home where they mated with natural felines, and within twenty  years, the devil cats were on every continent and Felis domesticus  was gone from the face of the world, replaced by a genetic string  that bred true ninety-eight percent of the time. (Windup 26–27) Just like the cat from Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, the cheshires can  blend with their environment, appearing only as shimmers in the  shadows, surviving either as fierce predators or as carrion eaters, hard  to kill and perfectly adapted to their hostile surroundings: ‘they are  clever, thriving in places where they are despised. almost supernatural  in their tenacity. sometimes it seems that they smell blood before it is  even spilled. as if they can peer a little way into the future and know  precisely where their next meal will appear’ (Windup 27). the chameleon-like abilities of the cheshires make them better- adapted predators and thus superior to natural evolution: ‘We create  a new species in a heartbeat of evolutionary time, and our songbird  population disappears almost as quickly” (Pump Six 115). in the fictional  world of the Windup stories, cheshires function as reminders that genetic  engineering allows a purely cultural intervention into nature – both  in the sense of their inception stemming from a work of literature  and in the sense of their artificial human creation, spliced together by  generippers for the sole purpose of supplying a superfluous consumer  demand. the hypercapitalist desire, fulfilled without consideration  of ecological consequence, leads to more than simply a new species  – instead the cheshires become symbols of the fragility of natural  hierarchies, in which the human sees itself at the top, at least for the  </page> <page sequence="16"> 86 Biopunk Dystopias moment: ‘a high-tech homage to Lewis Carroll, a few dirigible and  clipper ship rides, and suddenly entire classes of animals are wiped  out, unequipped to fight an invisible threat” (Windup 114). the cats and  their ‘ever-present, and unceasing gaze,’ as andrew Hageman argues,  are constant reminders of the inability to control natural adaptation:  ‘it is their gaze rather than their famous dazzling smiles that is deeply  unnerving as it shines from the dank darkness of alleyways and garbage  piles” (296). in introducing the cheshires, Bacigalupi signals to readers  the deep interconnection with nature and the posthuman subjectivity at  play – that humans are not separate from zoe, but always ‘become with’  other species, as Haraway argues: ‘species of all kinds, living and not,  are consequent on a subject- and object-shaping dance of encounters’  (When Species 17). Culture and nature interact; they shape each other  and are never separate. all species are part of this rhizomatic network  of connections and cheshires are the fictional prompt of the unfore- seeable intricacy of these interactions. in terms of a mechanized and utilitarian view of nature, this  uncontrollability and clear transgression of their anthropological purpose  pushes the cheshires into a monstrous ontological state, though – neither  natural nor cultural, the cats remain outside of their clearly hierarchical  position and defy the human symbolic order. in the stories, cheshires  are consequently symbolically banished from that order; they are  rejected as horrific and soulless. Most characters react to them with  ‘instinctive recoil’ and ‘gut revulsion’ (Mckibben, cited in Bouson  153) against anything genetically engineered. Further, cheshires are  hunted and declared felis sacra, to appropriate Giorgio agamben’s term –  killing them ‘carries no karmic cost’ in Buddhist thailand, as they are  considered unnatural ‘empty vessels. no soul fills them’ (Windup 173–74).  nonetheless, their spiritual status as soulless and thus as exempt from  the Buddhist cycle of rebirth cannot hide their uncertain ontological  status. the doubts of an agent of the Environment Ministry tasked to  kill them make this clear: ‘they bleed like any other animal [...] i’ve killed thousands of  them. thousands. i’ve killed six men in my life and never regretted  any of them, but i’ve killed thousands of cheshires and have never  felt at ease.’ He pauses, scratches behind his ear [...] ‘i sometimes  wonder if my family’s cibiscosis was karmic retribution for all  those cheshires.’ ‘it couldn’t be. they’re not natural.’ somchai shrugs. ‘they breed. they eat. they live. they breathe.’  He smiles slightly. ‘if you pet them, they will purr.’ </page> <page sequence="17"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 87 Jaidee makes a face of disgust. ‘it’s true. i have touched them. they are real. as much as you or  i.’ (Windup 174) in their ontological liminality, the cheshires are truly monstrous  creatures: ‘they are disturbing hybrids whose externally incoherent  bodies resist attempts to include them in any systematic structuration.  and so the monster is dangerous, a form suspended between forms  that threatens to smash distinctions’ (J. Cohen 6). suspended on the  boundary of life and death (as empty, soulless vessels), nature and  culture, and there/not-there (due to their shifting fur), the cheshires  undermine any hierarchical clarity. they threaten the established  order and are a constant reminder that ‘the human’ finds itself in  a similarly precarious position in regard to the posthuman as the  ordinary housecat when faced with cheshires. as Hageman notes, this  fierce antagonism towards the genetically engineered nature of both  cheshires and post humans unites them in that Emiko, the representative  of the posthuman in the novel, feels kinship with the creatures and  understands their transgressive, even revolutionary power: ‘they are too  much improved for this world, i think” (Windup 113; see Hageman 296). the same superiority, the impossibility of fitting into any natural  niche, is true for quite a few examples of atwood’s transgenic creations.  the inhabitants of this ‘brave new biosphere’ ‘represent emergence and  flux in the relationship between humans and other species’ (Rozelle  70). the best example of this flux might be found in the change that  overcomes the relationship between humans and dogs, which Haraway  calls the ‘fleshly material-semiotic presences in the body of techno- science [...] partners in the crime of human evolution, they are in the  garden from the get-go’ (Companion Species 5). in Oryx and Crake, this  most domesticated of all companion species is turned into a weapon  to be wielded – called ‘BioDefences’: ‘they aren’t dogs, they just look  like dogs. they’re wolvogs – they are bred to deceive. Reach out to  pat them, they’ll take your hand off’ (249–50). Created to manipulate  human emotion and to use that evolutionary link to the companion  species, the wolvogs represent the ultimate perversion of that ‘obligatory,  constitutive, historical, protean relationship’ (Haraway, Companion Species  12) that exists between the two species. it reduces the complexity of the  species’ interrelation, which encompassed the full array of positive and  negative – ‘waste, cruelty, indifference, ignorance and loss, as well as [...]  joy, invention, labor, intelligence and play” (Haraway, Companion Species  12) – by producing the animal as a genetic commodity, ‘commission  work’ (Oryx 250) for the security company, nature fully separated from  </page> <page sequence="18"> 88 Biopunk Dystopias culture and the animal as object of specific use. already in its genetic  design, this species incorporates the impossibility of fitting into a natural  niche, while at the same time threatening its anthropological purpose.  as guard dogs, the wolvogs are nearly impossible to handle – ‘no way  of making pals with them’ (Oryx 250) – but after they escape they  become an even larger threat to the human population. indeed, after the  plague has wiped out most human life, non-human life begins to thrive  in the novels, as Lee Rozelle rightly remarks: instead of an ecological  wasteland, the world surrounding snowman is full of life – it reveals ‘a  resilience and increased adaptive capacity of plant and animals species’  (65), including the transgenic species. the problem – at least for the remaining humans – is that the new  transgenic species challenge any remaining delusions of a mastery  over nature by adapting to life beyond their preconceived functions.  Where geneticists (very reminiscent of the biopunk manifesto) design  new life forms ‘as an after-hours hobby’ by simply ‘fooling around’  because ‘create-an-animal was so much fun [...] it made you feel  like God’ (Oryx 59), it seems only fitting that many of the genetically  engineered creatures do not remain fixed in natural niches and threaten  all categorization: ‘the snat, an unfortunate blend of snake and rat:  they had to get rid of those’ (Oryx 59–60), or the bobkitten, created to  hunt glow-in-the-dark bunnies. in their transgression of genetic and  anthropological purpose, bob kittens thus strongly repeat the matrix of  Bacigalupi’s cheshires: those things were introduced as a control, once the big green rabbits  had become such a prolific and resistant pest. smaller than bobcats,  less aggressive – that was the official story about the bobkittens.  they were supposed to eliminate feral cats, thus improving the  almost non-existent songbird population. the bobkittens wouldn’t  bother much about birds, as they would lack the lightness and  agility necessary to catch them. thus went the theory. all of which  came true, except that the bobkittens soon got out of control in  their turn. small dogs went missing from backyards, babies from  prams; short joggers were mauled. (Oryx 199–200) Just as with the cheshires, the genetically created species does not adhere  to genetic program, instead expanding its natural niche and proving  threatening to the human in both the symbolic and the ontological  order by becoming monstrous. </page> <page sequence="19"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 89 3.2.3 Human-Becoming-Animal or Animal-Becoming-Human the one creature in atwood’s trilogy that ‘transgress[es] natural barriers  and challenge[s] the solid line between humans and nonhumans’  (Galbreath 2) most aggressively is the pigoon, created as medical organ  donors for humans: the goal of the pigoon project was to grow an assortment of  foolproof human-tissue organs in a transgenic knockout pig host  – organs that would transplant smoothly and avoid rejection, but  would also be able to fend off attacks by opportunistic microbes  and viruses, of which there were more strains every year. a rapid- maturity gene was spliced in so the pigoon kidneys and livers and  hearts would be ready sooner, and now they were perfecting a  pigoon that could grow five or six kidneys at a time. such a host  animal could be reaped of its extra kidneys; then, rather than  being destroyed, it could keep on living and grow more organs.  (Oryx 27–28) What makes the pigoons categorically so challenging and transgressive  is their infusion with human Dna – first they are ‘customized, using  cells from individual human donors’ (Oryx 28) so that customers can  have their own body parts regrown, then later in the novel, the pigoons  are spliced with human brain tissue: ‘it’s the neuro-regeneration project.  We now have genuine human neocortex tissue growing in a pigoon.  Finally, after all those duds!’ (Oryx 66). this, of course, is the central  argument for all blurring of categorial order, as Warkentin rightly notes:  ‘the purpose of this process is to make a pig’s body less pig-like so that  it can become more compatible with human bodies, and in essence,  more human (at least on a physiological level)’ (90). as a result, the pigoons completely undermine any conception  of human exceptionalism and frightfully cast into doubt the neat  boundaries of nature/culture and human/animal that liberal humanism  builds subjectivity upon. on the one hand, pigoons clearly destabilize  exceptionalist views by becoming in part human. When human organs  can be replaced by parts grown in other animal species, this process  reduces the human itself to be a part of a technoscientific, mechanized  view of nature. as Chung-Hao ku argues, atwood’s ‘bioengineered  creatures [...] eventually interrogate their human creators’ physical  constitution and hierarchical supremacy [...] [they] do not simply negate  animality [...] their partial resemblance to human beings actually  challenges the human form as well’ (112). Further, both pigoon and  </page> <page sequence="20"> 90 Biopunk Dystopias human are reduced from life forms to mere values in a utilitarian system  of hypercapitalist consumption, ‘reducing both non-human animals and  humans to controllable commodities’ (Dunlap 3). on the other hand, pigoons once more exemplify the ‘unscrupulous  use of zoe’ (Botta 244), which capitalism practices without regard for  animal subjectivity or the interconnection of natural ecosystems. pigoons  are ‘non-human slaves and voiceless properties in the Compound- plantations, [...] judged by their utility to humanity’ (Galbreath 3).  their use is degraded to medical organ farm or to food source – which,  in connection with the destabilization of human/animal boundaries,  becomes an even bigger challenge to existing hierarchies. as Jovian  parry notes, eating animal flesh is in itself a destabilizing act in the  human/animal divide: although the act of eating meat can be seen as a powerful assertion  of human supremacy and dominance over nonhuman animals and  the natural world [...] thus serving to maintain this distinction, it  simultaneously blurs it. the act of eating animal flesh has often  been thought to transmit those desirable qualities which humans  have filed under ‘animal,’ such as strength and virility (244–45) When the pigoons are first introduced and infused with human Dna  (not yet the neocortex tissue), the categorial insecurity already shows  through, exemplified in Jimmy’s reaction to the rich assortment of pork  products in the cafeteria: ‘pigoon pie again,’ they would say. ‘pigoon pancakes, pigoon  popcorn. Come on, Jimmy, eat up!’ this would upset Jimmy; he  was confused about who should be allowed to eat what. He didn’t  want to eat a pigoon, because he thought of the pigoons as creatures  much like himself. neither he nor they had a lot of say in what  was going on. (Oryx 29) at the heart of this insecurity lies the cultural acceptance of anthropophagy.  if human and pigoon life are gradually becoming the same – as ku states,  ‘crossing the frontier between human and animal, pigoons are now the  double – the demoting yet curing, fearful yet adorable other – of human  beings’ (113) – then eating human flesh becomes acceptable. the practices  of meat consumption regarding secretBurgers support this argument.  and in MaddAddam, confronted with the posthuman other of the pigoons,  humanity (what remains of it) has no trouble at all in ‘turn[ing] them  into bacon’: ‘Franken bacon, considering they’re splices. i still feel kind  </page> <page sequence="21"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 91 of weird about eating them. they’ve got human neocortex tissue’ (Madd  19). Even though the Maddaddam group not only knows that pigoons are  posthuman (in the sense of their technoscientific creation and incorpo- ration of human Dna) but features many members recruited from an  environmentalist group that promoted a zoe-centric approach to life, the  surviving humans have no qualms about slaughtering the pigoons: ‘“Dig  in, sweetie. pig in three forms: bacon, ham, and chops.” it hadn’t taken  them long to backslide on the Gardener Vegivows, thinks toby’ (Madd  34). parry argues that inherent in this urge to eat meat is the humanist  assumption of an exceptional and superior position over nature, as well  as the ideology that eating meat (exerting power over nature) is ‘an  inescapable part of true human nature’ (252). ironically, it is exactly this assumption of ‘human nature’ as rightfully  on top of the food chain that is being challenged by the pigoons. From  novel to novel, atwood presents the pigoons progressively more as  posthuman, disrupting the superior position of the human not only  by ‘dehumanizing’ it, but also by manifesting human-like traits in the  pigoons – thus depicting them as ‘men in porcine masks’ (ku 114). in Oryx and Crake, the pigoons are first shown to grow tusks and  become wild, ‘reverting to type now they’d gone feral, a fast-forward  process considering their rapid-maturity genes’ (45). they turn into  aggressive predators, at some point starting to hunt snowman for  food – reversing the food chain and making the human edible meat.  the human neocortex makes them more predatory, and snowman  experiences first-hand their tactical thinking: ‘those beasts are clever  enough to fake a retreat, then lurk around the next corner. they’d  bowl him over, trample him, then rip him open, munch up the organs  first [...] a brainy and omnivorous animal, the pigoon. some of them  may even have human neocortex tissue growing in their crafty, wicked  heads” (Oryx 284). and indeed, the pigoons recognize weapons, retreat  from perceived threats, communicate with each other, and plan their  attack by cutting snowman off from his escape route and trapping  him in a gatehouse:  now one of them spots him through the window. More grunting:  now they’re all looking up at him [...] team players, the pigoons.  there’s a lot of muscle out there. if they can’t push through the  door they’ll wait him out. they’ll take it in relays, some grazing  outside, others watching. (Oryx 322–23)  the pigoons, as sharon Wilson notes, ‘get revenge on human beings  who lack reverence for other beings or the natural world. Like the pigs  </page> <page sequence="22"> 92 Biopunk Dystopias in Animal Farm, the pigoons in this cautionary tale show intelligence  and teamwork: on snowman’s quest to the destroyed compound, they  maliciously watch and attack’ (113). Wilson’s comment, especially the intertextual connection, suggests  human qualities (revenge, politics), thus an anthropomorphizing of the  pigoons, which at least for Oryx and Crake could still be relativized in  that it is snowman’s feverish perspective (focalized in the narration)  that ascribes the human traits, perhaps still retained from his childhood  experiences and reemerging when he is threatened by the categorically  transgressive beings: ‘the adults were slightly frightening [...] [t]hey  glanced up at him as if they saw him, really saw him, and might have  plans for him later’ (Oryx 32). in The Year of the Flood, though, atwood  adds toby’s perception of the human qualities of the pigoons. after she  notices three ‘huge pigs’ by her vegetable garden that are not deterred by  the fence but begin to dig (‘they’ll tunnel under’; 18–19), she kills one  of them with her rifle – driving the rest off. the pigs return one night  and get into the garden: ‘they’ve dug under the fence, then gone on a  rampage. surely it was less like a feeding frenzy than a deliberate act  of revenge. the earth is furrowed and trampled: anything they haven’t  eaten they’ve bull dozed’ (Year 319–20). once again, the narrative is  internally focalized on a human threatened by extinction, blurring the  line between objective reality and toby’s perception when she notices the  group looking in her direction: ‘Beady eyes, one per pig: they’re looking  at her sideways. they’ve been watching for her: it’s as if they want to  witness her dismay. Moreover, they’re out of range: if she shoots at them  she’ll waste the bullets. she wouldn’t put it past them to have figured  that out’ (320). so, when ashley Dawson argues that the pigoons ‘engage  in lamentable human behavior such as the revenge-driven destruction of  toby’s vegetable garden’ (68), an anthropomorphizing view of the splices  seems to manifest itself in the novel. or it may just be the human(ist)  failure to make sense of a non-human animal culture. indeed, atwood makes it hard not to establish a human baseline  when evaluating the pigoons’ actions when she describes their treatment  of the boar that toby shot in the beginning of the novel: ‘there are  fronds scattered about, on top of the boar’s carc ass and beside it [...]  also flowers. are those rose petals, from the roses by the driveway?  she’d heard of something like this [...] about elephants [...] But pigs?  usually they’d just eat a dead pig, the same way they’d eat anything  else’ (Year 328). toby here functions as reflector of the humanist,  anthropocentric view that ‘excludes animal forms of society, culture  and language by definition’ (noske 187). Confronted with proof against  such reductionist views of culture, toby begins to voice concern, though:  </page> <page sequence="23"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 93 ‘Could the pigs have been having a funeral? Could they be bringing  memorial bouquets? she finds this idea truly frightening. But why not?  [...] We believe the animals have souls. Why then would they not have  funerals?’ (Year 328). in allowing doubt that the pigoons have some  sort of culture, atwood again undermines the clear-cut demarcation  of the animal/human boundary and questions the belief in human  exceptionalism. in fact, the pigoons seem to have evolved beyond their  genetic program: ‘the practice of mixing human and pig genetic material  for numerous generations has endowed pigoons with a certain amount  of human similarity’ (Warkentin 93). in this, the novels clearly show  that ‘organisms can and will respond to biological and ecological changes  in unpredictable ways’ (Warkentin 94). Moreover, in MaddAddam, the final novel of the trilogy, atwood goes  so far as to endow the pigoons not simply with the agency to find a  natural niche, attack the humans threatening their niche, and create  an animal culture, but also with enough intellectual reasoning power  to become fully subjective posthuman creatures. the novel’s con cluding  parts reveal a tribal community of pigoons, capable of interspecies  communication, politics, law, and diplomacy. atwood even introduces compassion for the pigoons and an  understanding of their culture through the other posthuman creatures  in her story world. the Crakers can ‘speak’ with the pigoons via their  ‘Craker voice, not human’ (Madd 223) – they function as ‘translators’  between the human and the animal. at first toby and the other  Maddaddamites are skeptical of any communication, dismissing the  experience as the result of drugs and hallucinations, but soon the  pigoon community appears to seek help from the human group: ‘it’s  weird. they’re marching. it’s like a pig parade’ (Madd 267). More than  50 adult pigs plus their young have gathered, offering a temporary  ‘ceasefire’ (‘they have said they will not harm you today’; Madd 268),  carrying a dead piglet (‘a tiny one, with its throat cut. its front trotters  are tied together with rope’; Madd 269) and presenting the humans with  a proposition for interspecies cooperation: they are asking for help. they want to stop those ones. those ones  who are killing their pig babies [...] they want you to help them  with the sticks you have. they know how you kill, by making holes.  and then blood comes out. they want you to make such holes in  the three bad men. With blood [...] and in return [...] they will  never again try to eat your garden. or any of you [...] Even if you  are dead, they will not eat you. and they ask that you must no  longer make holes in them, with blood, and cook them in a smelly  </page> <page sequence="24"> 94 Biopunk Dystopias bone soup, or hang them in the smoke, or fry them and then eat  them. not any more. (Madd 269–70) a deal between pigoons and humans is struck, the posthuman Crakers  facilitating an understanding between cultures (‘We’re too stupid, we  don’t understand their languages. so there has to be a translator’;  Madd 270). But this translator obviously problematizes the depiction  of a pigoon culture – there is a double distancing at work here, as  Blackbeard (the Craker boy) translates pigoon snorts and thinking into  human language, without himself fully grasping the human concepts.  it is thus unclear in this passage if the pigoons use concepts such as  ‘bad men’ or ‘smelly bone’ or if these are Blackbeard’s constructions. is  Blackbeard responsible for the assortment of terms for food preparations  (cooking, smoking, frying) or are the pigoons? Maybe these concepts  are even the results of another distancing, that of human recording of  posthuman translation of animal language. the novel itself presents as  an epistolary-style recording, written by toby, thus implying another  agency at work. Consequently, the anthropocentric view of that animal culture  remains, in the writing but also in the character’s reflection. When  the pigoons leave their dead piglet for the humans to consume, toby  judges the act by human ethical standards: ‘Curious funeral rites, thinks  toby. you strew the beloved with flowers, you mourn, and then you eat  the corpse. no-holds barred recycling. Even adam and the Gardeners  never went that far’ (Madd 271). Here atwood dwells on the funeral  rite as iconic sign for the existence of culture, returning to the ritual  of flowers and composting several times. When two humans need to  be buried later, the pigoons carry the dead ‘as a sign of friendship and  interspecies co-operation,’ and once more, cultural understanding has  to be facilitated by translation: Following a short discussion, the pigoons understood that we did  not wish to eat adam and Jimmy, nor would we wish the pigoons  to do that. and they concurred. their rules in such matters appear  complex: dead farrow are eaten by pregnant mothers to provide  more protein for growing infants, but adults, and especially adults  of note, are contributed to the general ecosystem. all other species  are, however, up for grabs. (Madd 373) as before, the anthropocentric position lingers and the reader remains  uncertain who used the term ‘friendship’ and what it designates for the  pigoons. are the pigoons really reasoning for an economy of protein?  </page> <page sequence="25"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 95 Do they have an understanding of the term ‘ecosystem’ or ‘species’?  Readers are unable to breach the conceptual distance, which exists in  these passages because of translation and narration. in the battle between the Maddaddam group (recruited from both  humans and pigoons) and the painballers, atwood portrays the pigoons  as fine military tacticians, standing guard and clearing away possible  cover (340), scouting possible routes and dangers, using messengers and  running in formation (‘the main van of older and heavier pigoons: the  tank battalion’; Madd 346). Later, they take part in a tribunal, voting  in unison on the death of the painballers (Madd 370). interestingly, the  Crakers do not understand the concepts of ‘voting’ and holding a ‘trial’;  nonetheless they function as cultural translators. aside from the military  cooperation, atwood also includes a scene of communal bliss, showing  pigoon families enjoying a swimming pool: ‘the younger ones enjoy  splashing and squealing; the older sows and boars take brief dips, then  watch over their piglets and shoats indulgently, lounging at the poolside.  toby wonders if pigs get sunburn’ (Madd 284). and later, when all have  agreed to uphold their contract for the future, two pigoon adolescents  are found in the garden, technically breaking the agreement: a conference was called. the pigoons sent a delegation of three  adults, who seemed both embarrassed and cross, as adults put to  shame by their young usually are. Blackbeard stood as interpreter.  it would not happen again, said the pigoons. the young offenders  had been threatened with a sudden transition to a state of bacon  and soup bones, which seems to have made the desired impression.  (Madd 378) in these scenes, as one reviewer remarks, atwood seems to offer a  ‘walking, snorting tribute to Animal Farm’ (Churchwell 43), fitting  well with the anthropomorphic and clearly satirical tone of the scenes.  unfortunately, the same tone and intertextual reference also undermines  any posthumanist reading. the depiction of the pigoons as ‘men in  porcine masks’ goes beyond the indeterminate reading of posthuman– human translation present in the scenes discussed earlier. pigoons as  military masterminds, as summer guests at the poolside, or in the roles  of disobedient, rebellious youth and shamed, disapproving parent – all  of these are blatantly anthropocentric, not due to narrative unreliability  or translational distance. Bacigalupi’s depiction of the transgressive and categorically ambivalent  cheshires shows a subtle questioning of the position of the human in  face of the posthuman, thus allowing for a posthumanist reading that  </page> <page sequence="26"> 96 Biopunk Dystopias challenges notions of humanist subjectivity and engages its readers in  critical dystopian thinking. it reveals a zoe-centric worldview, in which  the human is interconnected and always becoming with, as Haraway put it,  other species and the environment. atwood’s trilogy, on the other hand,  gestures towards a ‘rejection of the anthropomorphic viewpoint [...]  [which] struggles to re-position humanity as one species among many  in a web of natural connections’ (Hatch 181) but in the end returns to  the safe harbor of humanist thinking. pigoon society can be accepted  because of its human construction – even when direct communication  fails, the liberal humanist concepts of freedom, equality, and brotherhood  somehow seem to apply. Brothers in arms come together over their  similarities rather than having to negotiate the ‘differénd,’ the ‘absent  phrase’ of the ‘broken discourse between humans and animal others’  (Galbreath 3) that led to suffering and the mechanized view of nature  (how easy it was to forget Gardener teachings and utilize animals).  atwood’s trilogy does open negotiations of human–animal relations; it  proposes the possibility of non-anthropocentric culture and accepts an  interconnection of humans with their environment – as such the books  allow for the posthuman view to be expressed. But the humanist view  is similarly present and grows stronger towards the third installment,  culminating in the positive outlook towards the future that is owed  mainly to its humanist values. utopia lies in the posthuman – simply  because it is seen to be human in essence. 3.3 The Better Human:   Posthumanity and the Replacement of ‘Us’ as we have seen, the depiction of animal–human hybridity in both  Bacigalupi and atwood has already undermined clear-cut distinctions of  categorial separateness and human exceptionalism. Furthermore, both  writers understand the potential of genetic manipulation by contemporary  technoscience as deeply troubling and threatening to human subjectivity  and the position of the human within the interconnected web that is zoe.  to illustrate such a threatened position, both atwood and Bacigalupi thus  enact the posthuman not simply categorically by undermining human  conceptions and values but by introducing a posthuman, genetically  engineered species as a tangible danger to human superiority. in atwood’s trilogy, the Children of Crake, or Crakers, are created by  a genius geneticist as an improvement on the human species. Financed by  the corporation as ‘floor models’ (Oryx 363) for the creation of made-to- order children, the Crakers are designed by Crake to be ‘the future  </page> <page sequence="27"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 97 human race,’ ‘the art of the possible’ (Oryx 366–67), with customizable  features to be chosen out of a catalogue. physical beauty, rapid growth,  and resistance to diseases and environmental hazards are part of the  package, as is the removal of any ‘negative’ features of the human  (according to Crake) such as hierarchical, symbolic, or competitive  thinking. the Crakers are docile, vegetarian, friendly. they have no  concept of time, death, God, or art. they can resist uV radiation, repel  insects with a citrus smell, fend off predatory animals via marking their  territory, and come into heat in regular intervals in order to consen- sually mate in groups, favoring communal social interaction and not  pair-bonding (Oryx 363ff.). as Gerry Canavan argues, the Crakers ‘should  be understood as a hyperbolic version of the fantasy that we might turn  back the clock and begin history anew, this time avoiding the mistake  of so-called “civilization”’ (152). in Bacigalupi’s world, on the other hand, the posthuman is created  solely for utilitarian purposes, a species of servants, soldiers, and workers.  His new people are genetically altered to serve specific functions and to  address the demographic changes in Japan, where too few young need  to care for too many old. new people are endowed with superhuman  characteristics, such as perfect appearance – symbolized in their almost  flawless skin without pores –, augmented senses (Windup 35), extreme  speed (Windup 300), and near-perfect hand-eye coordination. in order  to control such superhuman beings, new people have been created  with fail-safe mechanisms such as genetically forced obedience (‘canine  Dna’; Windup 184), sterility, and (except for the military models)  the eponymous characteristic of ‘stylized and deliberate movements,’  so reminiscent of nineteenth-century automata that they are called  ‘windup’ (Windup 36). 3.3.1 Hierarchies of Power: Laughing at the Posthuman Bacigalupi uses this feature of ‘artificial’ movement to negotiate the  necessity of power hierarchies between the species, combining in this one  element a marker that excludes and one that demotes. Her movements  reveal Emiko as other and as inferior: ‘all they see are stutter-stop motions.  a joke. an alien toy. a windup’ (Windup 36). Designed as a courtesan, a  geisha of ancient Japan, Emiko is made with a specific purpose in mind  that already historically links her to inferiority and servitude. in that  limited cultural context her motions seem almost ‘natural’: ‘the girl is  perfect, precise as clockwork, and contextualized by the tea ceremony, all  her motions take on a ritual grace’ (Windup 297). Her ‘natural’ position  is that of servant, and thus obedience is both genetically engineered  </page> <page sequence="28"> 98 Biopunk Dystopias and culturally instilled by training within a crèche (Windup 153–54).  Within that original cultural niche, Emiko’s position would already be  conflicted, as she merely fulfills a specific purpose, nonetheless gaining a  certain amount of respect for performing well: ‘she is loyal, thoughtful,  and skilled. a necessary tool. she is as necessary as a hoe for a farmer  or a sword for a samurai’ (Windup 298). interesting to note is the contra- diction inherent in her creation by modern technoscience (genetics)  and the comparison with outdated technology that references back to  ancient Japanese traditions, such as a hoe or a sword. But even though  this utilitarian view of new people as replaceable technology dominates,  it is relativized by a belief system that supports the hierarchical position  as ‘almost human’ and promises the reward of progression: ‘their duty  was to serve, their honor was to serve, and their reward would come in  the next life, when they became fully human. service would yield the  greatest rewards’ (Windup 153–54). outside this specific niche, Emiko reveals herself as alien other  in several different ways: First, she is a Japanese among the thai,  and for the social and cultural differences alone ostracized (‘the dirty  Japanese get what is coming to them’; Windup 38). second, due to her  privileged position in Japanese society, as a rich man’s servant, Emiko is  ‘manu factured to have a porcelain skin and reduced pores, but it means  she is subject to over heating’ (Windup 300) outside of air-conditioned  rooms. in the swelter of Contraction-era thailand, she is continuously  dependent on others to provide her with cost- and calorie-intensive  cooling (ice, water, fans), again emphasizing both her inferior position  and categorical otherness. third, when she moves with control, others  see her motion as artificial and ‘stutter-stop flashbulb strange’ (Windup  35), but when Emiko is forced against her will to move in a sexual rape  act on stage, her motion becomes the object of a power play, ridiculing  her, and revealing her for what she is, inferior, inhuman, and helpless: [E]veryone is laughing at how Emiko’s body twitches and jerks now  that she is in a panic, coughing the liquid from her lungs. she is  nothing but a silly marionette creature now, all stutter-stop motion  – herky-jerky heechy-keechy – with no trace of the stylized grace  that her mistress Mizumi-sensei trained into her when she was a  girl in the crèche. there is no elegance or care to her movements  now; the telltales of her Dna are violently present for all to see  and mock. (Windup 37) the tone of ridicule and degradation is important in this scene.  Emiko’s otherness is displayed in front of an audience as a release  </page> <page sequence="29"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 99 valve – providing distance from the threats that her ontological status  represents, but also from the socio-economic reality of inferiority of those  that cannot afford the luxury of such items as genetically engineered  labor. But at the same time, the value of new people as a species is  diminished; they are relegated to their position as inferior within the  ‘natural’ order – a position that Emiko accepts by implicit agreement  with the ridicule. the passage is internally focalized through Emiko  and thus reveals her own silent complicity, as she defines herself solely  through the obvious distinguishing mark: ‘Her limbs twitch and flail,  giving everyone a chance to see her true nature’ (Windup 37). Most characters in the book treat Emiko as inferior, using her  movement as a telltale marker of otherness. Emiko is confronted with  racist remarks and actions – her movement is ridiculed and singled out  as signature of an unnatural creation. Emiko’s own reaction seems to  confirm the obvious success of this social strategy as she demurely accepts  an inferior position. For the reader, the indignity of the scene and the  repeated rape and torture that Emiko has to endure throughout the  novel have a different effect though. the allegorical nature of Emiko’s  struggle becomes obvious and forces readers to question their own  positions of privilege and strategies of accepting or rejecting otherness.  the characters in the novel laugh at otherness to hide their anxiety  about the threat it represents; the reader on the other hand is forced  into compassion. the abuse and violence of the scenes are so drastic  and overtly described that they reveal the perpetrators as inhuman. as  Bacigalupi himself argues, ‘it seemed like the reader needed to be in the  room during her abuse, so that her later actions would seem acceptable’  (cited in Vorda 18). Emiko’s mistreatment is so hard to bear that readers  are driven to empathize with her – realizing posthuman subjectivity and  a fundamental connection despite her perceived otherness, not because  she is human, but as Derrida argued (for animals, but true here for the  posthuman nonetheless), because she suffers. to pose the question, ‘Can  they suffer?’ he says, means to be implicitly asking about an inability  to act and realizing the powerlessness of that position: Being able to suffer is no longer a power, it is a possibility without  power, a possibility of the impossible. Mortality resides there, as  the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with  animals, the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life,  to the experience of compassion, to the possibility of sharing the  possibility of this nonpower, the possibility of this impossibility, the  anguish of this vulnerability and the vulnerability of this anguish.  (Derrida 396) </page> <page sequence="30"> 100 Biopunk Dystopias the reader cannot ‘deny the suffering, fear or panic, the terror or  fright’ (Derrida 396) that is present in Emiko, and ‘the undeniable of  this response’ (Derrida 397) then changes the argument of humanist  exceptionalism. Being witness to this creature’s suffering makes it  impossible to ignore the existence of a common nature – all species can  suffer and die. Emiko’s movements are ridiculous, and she is laughed  at consistently throughout the novel. By focalizing the narration on  Emiko, though, the reader becomes painfully aware of her subjectivity  and the suffering the laughter causes, and is thus narratively forced into  a communion with the posthuman. Margaret atwood, in her Maddaddam trilogy, also uses specific  behavioral patterns and physical differences to mark the Crakers as  posthuman, and, similarly, these markers generate ridicule among the  other characters. in reducing genetics to a toolkit of useful abilities, Crake  designed the Crakers with an eye for function, not for aesthetics and  human customs, and thus their natural behavior elicits ridicule among  the remaining humans. in concentrating on the physical differences from  the human as standard, stephen Dunning points out, it ‘is hard to take  these purring, multi-colored, blue-bottomed, blue-penised, excrement- eating, perimeter-pissing, citrous-scented [sic] creatures seriously’ (95).  accordingly, characters satirically comment on the genetic features: they  describe their purring as ‘making a noise like a kitchen mixer’ (Madd  12) and ask, ‘are they like batteries that have to be recharged?’ (Madd  99). their insect-repellent smell is described as ‘citrus air freshener’  (Madd 90) and their general non-aggressiveness makes them ‘walking  potatoes’ and ‘vegetables’ (Madd 19). one aspect of their nature that is more strongly singled out for ridicule  is their digestion, which Crake copied from a rabbit and its ability to  recycle its own excrement. snowman is disgusted by the concept, even  though it is clearly superior to his starving from malnutrition: ‘He finds  the caecotrophs revolting [...] However you look at it, he’d said, what  it boiled down to was eating your own shit’ (Oryx 194). Crake argues  it is necessary when eating raw plants, and that any ‘objections to the  process were purely aesthetic’ (Oryx 194). But not only is snowman  disgusted, he also jokes about the feature when he reduces the Crakers  to bobkitten prey because of this one aspect of their genetic make-up:  ‘they can smell the rabbity aroma of the caecotrophs’ (Oryx 194). But even more than the ‘edible poo’ (Madd 92), as toby ridicules  the essentially designed-for-survival ability, the Crakers reproductive  mechanisms are constantly made fun of. Craker women are sexually  receptive ‘once every three years’ (Oryx 200), thus making the mating  cycle rather scarce. For their mating, Crake has combined baboon  </page> <page sequence="31"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 101 and octopus Dna, so that the woman in heat signals her status via  ‘the bright-blue colour of her buttocks and abdomen’ (Oryx 201) and  a pheromone release that, in turn, makes the males react similarly.  snowman’s description of the mating ritual already expresses his malice: Courtship begins at the first whiff, the first faint blush of azure,  with the males presenting flowers to the females [...] their penises  turn bright blue to match the blue abdomens of the females, and  they do a sort of blue-dick dance number, erect members waving to  and fro in unison, in time to the foot movements and the singing:  a feature suggested to Crake by the sexual semaphoring of crabs.  From amongst the floral tributes the female chooses four flowers,  and the sexual ardour of the unsuccessful candidates dissipates  immediately, with no hard feelings left. (Oryx 201) the ironic distance present in this description is mainly evoked through  the doubled voice of free indirect discourse: it is clearly the heterodiegetic  narration presenting the scene, but snowman’s laconic tonality and  diction that dominates it, without any markers of him ever thinking or  speaking, though. nonetheless, it becomes clear that snowman ridicules  the mating ritual and thus marks the Crakers as other. similarly, the feature is commented upon by almost all the other  human characters in the trilogy. When toby first sees the Crakers, she  thinks they are a hallucination and shakes the image off by reminding  herself not to go crazy – ‘no naked blue-tinged singers’ (Year 165). Ren,  even though she has been warned about them, similarly jokes (‘nudist  camp’; Year 408) before feeling threatened by their ritualistic signaling.  she can only help herself stay calm by ridiculing the Crakers, denying  them equal humanity, and placing them as inferior: ‘at this, the men all  smile [...] and their penises point at me and wag from side to side like  the tails of happy dogs. Four? all at once? i don’t want toby to shoot  any of these men [...] but also i don’t want those bright-blue penises  anywhere near me’ (Year 410). Ren’s contradictory reaction is dominated  by fascination, but ultimately without understanding, in that she calls  them ‘men’ while at the same time comparing them to ‘happy dogs’  and fearing the need to have toby shoot them if they don’t conform to  her standard of behavior. But more importantly than the human characters’ relentless ridicule  – as the abovementioned ironic distancing shows – atwood herself  seems to poke fun at the Crakers. Readers identify with the narrative  position, and thus with the main characters and their evaluation of  the situation and of the Crakers. Critics have consequently called the  </page> <page sequence="32"> 102 Biopunk Dystopias Crakers ‘a kind of bizarre spectacle and extended authorial joke’ (Bouson  141), ‘a living satire of the errors of the utilitarian imagination’ (Brydon  453), ‘a sideways, funhouse-mirror, only-kidding glimpse’ at humanity  (Canavan 152), and finally ‘outwardly human yet emotionally and  mentally retarded’ (pordzik 153). their overtly prejudiced description,  the naïveté of their actions, and the repeatedly mentioned mating  ritual – all point toward atwood’s own stance on the position of the  Crakers as non-human: ‘i’d call them clever primates’ (cited in Case  and McDonald 43). there does seem to be a certain compassion for the  Crakers, described either as harmless animals and thus inferior or as  ‘Crake’s children, and like children tremendously vulnerable’ (ingersoll  168): ‘the Children of Crake, for all their innocence and peaceful ways,  are fundamentally nonhuman – are fundamentally subhuman’ (parry  252). nonetheless, they remain other. in contrast to Bacigalupi’s new people, whose suffering elicited  compassion and an active engagement with the posthuman condition,  the Crakers function as a satirical commentary and a comic relief for  readers that feel threatened not by the creatures but by the potential  of their creation. Being replaced by these creatures would mean losing  everything that makes us human; it is, in Francis Fukuyama’s words, ‘a  devil’s bargain [...] [s]orry, but your soul just died’ (8–9) – a sentiment  many critics seem to read in atwood’s treatment of the Crakers. their  features and behaviors are ridiculous to us – mainly because we cannot  identify with them. in connection to the human, edible poo and  blue-tinged penises are bizarre and ridiculous; they need to be relegated  to an inferior position so as not to threaten our ontology. But as Rozelle  notes, ‘when we observe these traits in other species, they are understood  as appropriate to specific adaptive functions’ and thus might best be  evaluated ‘without undue anthropo morphism’ (68). it is interesting to note, then, that atwood does not relativize any  readerly perceptions of her posthumans by allowing identification with  them. in Oryx and Crake as well as The Year of the Flood, the Crakers  remain passive reflections of the failure of human civilization and  voiceless allegories for the potential of genetic engineering. they are  present without ever really featuring as characters – rather they seem to  be living props, similar to the painballers or the Mo’Hairs, pigoons, and  bobkittens, just another species of ‘animal’ that populates the new world,  either as threat or as resource. only with MaddAddam does atwood grant  the Crakers their own voice, although it is deeply tinged with humanist  conceptions of history, religion, and culture, as we shall see below. What is remarkable, in regard to the depiction of Craker culture  in the last part of the trilogy, is that atwood still does not allow  </page> <page sequence="33"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 103 compassion to arise – the satirical narrative voice remains and positions  the Crakers continuously as inhuman in Lyotard’s second sense of the  term: Humanity is thus not born ‘human,’ not ‘led by nature, not  programmed’ (Lyotard 3), but needs to be educated to become human.  Humans need to ‘acquire a “second” nature which [...] makes them fit for  life’ (Lyotard 3). in this conception, which of course is deeply humanist  and reduces the human to a well-cultured, privileged position, children  are thus inhuman in the sense that they lack this second nature, this  education in cultural norms – ‘not able to calculate its advantages, not  sensitive to common reason’ (Lyotard 3) – and adults retain this ‘obscure  savageness of childhood’ (Lyotard 4) to a degree, prompting them to  continuously fight against it – marking humanity, in the humanist notion  of the term, as transcendence of that savage state, the inhuman which  is always already present in the human. in MaddAddam, the Crakers function as reminders of the inhuman  in that sense, reflecting for the human characters their inner savageness  and the need to ‘educate’ against this. a good example can be found  in toby, who takes over from snowman the charge of caring for the  Children of Crake and providing them with stories every evening,  depicted as just that – a bedtime story for children: entrenched rituals  need to be observed, deviation from already heard stories needs to  be justified, constant questions about unknown concepts interrupt  the storytelling, explanations only provoke more questions and more  explanations in an endless cycle, and above all, the Crakers constantly  burst into song. the Crakers show the inhuman savageness especially  in their lack of understanding of the language, but also in their swiftly  changing interests and complete lack of social norms. toby is irritated,  but reminds herself of the need for patience, educating them even about  her frustration: ‘i am doing this thing with my hands on my forehead  because i have a headache. a headache is when there is a pain in your  head. thank you. i am sure purring would help. But it would also help if  you would stop asking so many questions’ (Madd 85). While the Crakers  and the humans live together, toby’s narrative becomes suffused with  an interior commentary – an aside of how to explain to the Crakers  what she is doing at the moment, or better put: a string of answers  to possible Craker questions which again lead to more questions. the  Crakers are a frustrating symbol of the cultural savagery of children,  of their incompleteness as human beings. thus, when toby teaches the young Craker Blackbeard how to  write, it is his voice that finally breaches the gap between the cultures  – not by giving insight into the posthuman, but rather by having  acquired the ‘second nature’ of human values and concepts. ironically,  </page> <page sequence="34"> 104 Biopunk Dystopias when Blackbeard becomes the storyteller, he is just as irritated by the  interruptions and the crystalline singing (that drives toby to have  headaches): ‘please don’t sing. [...] please don’t sing yet. [...] an umbrella  is a thing from the chaos. they used it for keeping the rain off their  bodies. i don’t know why they did that’ (Madd 385–86). Blackbeard has  become sufficiently ‘cultured’ by copying toby in her duties, completing  the ritual and conforming to expectation, but he is lacking true  understanding of human culture. similarly, the novel never allows the  reader to understand the posthuman culture by showing an acceptance  of the inhuman as it is. Even in Blackbeard’s voice, the Crakers remain  aloof, inhuman, and childish other. and that Crakers are indeed born naturally ‘Crakerish’ and not  ‘human,’ thus revealing their inhumanity instead, becomes dramatically  clear in a scene at the beginning of MaddAddam. once more, the mating  ritual of the Crakers is the focus of othering. Even though Crake designed  the Crakers not to feel constant sexual desire, they read the continuous  signaling of human female pheromones as being in heat (all the time),  thus aggressively initiating their mating ritual. When the ‘Crakerish’  reaction of choosing four partners does not occur, their genetic code  does not allow them to relinquish activity but causes them to pursue it  further. they do not understand the female’s unwillingness to mate, as  a Craker woman giving off such signals would indeed be in heat and  willing. But instead of handling the situation with compassion for the  inhuman/posthuman, the narrative evokes a frenzied rape scene that  is disturbing, yet bizarrely ridicules the Crakers: the Craker men, sniffing amanda: She is the blue one! She smells  blue! She wants to mate with us! Give her the flowers! She will be happy!  amanda scared: Stay away! I don’t ... Ren, help me! Four large,  beautiful, flower-toting naked men close in on her. Toby! Get them  away from me! Shoot them! [...] the Craker men: She is blue! She is  blue! We are happy! Sing to her! The other one is blue also! [...] toby  looks over, across the fire: amanda has disappeared in a flickering  thicket of naked male limbs and backs. Ren throws herself into the  sprawl and is quickly submerged. (Madd 12–13) toby’s reaction displays her helplessness, but also her complete incompre- hension: ‘this is a major cultural misunderstanding. if only she had a  pail of cold water!’ (Madd 13). in fact, the cultural misunderstanding is  hers, not that of the Crakers. she sees creatures that look like humans  and simply presupposes a common ‘human nature,’ something that an  education, a provision of a ‘second nature’ might reveal. the problem  </page> <page sequence="35"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 105 is not that the Crakers are not allowed subjectivity, but that they  are allowed humanist subjectivity only, in which they are children:  inhuman, unfinished, and in need of education. in following confrontations, whenever Craker sexuality is concerned,  they are described as ‘in the process of becoming human’ and unsure of  their ‘Crakerish’ nature: ‘Ever since they’ve learned that rambunctious  group copulation is not acceptable, they don’t know what’s expected  of them’ (Madd 100). they are trained to ignore their nature, because  it does not conform to human standards. indeed, the narrative voice  satirically comments on their sexuality as ‘wrong,’ ridiculing them.  Craker subjectivity, as being different but valid, is denied: Is she blue? One is blue. Two others were blue, we joined our blue to their  blue but we did not make them happy. They are not like our women, they  are not happy, they are broken. Did Crake make them? Why did he make  them that way, so they are not happy? [...] These women scream with  fright, they do not choose us even if we give them a flower, they do not  like a wagging penis. We do not make them happy, we do not know why  they scream. (Madd 100–02) though the passage is marked as dialogue, it remains unclear if toby  hears this being said or thinks this would be the Crakers’ discussion.3  the satirical stance of the narration remains active, but the reader’s  laughter about the innocence and ignorance of the Crakers as inferior  children here gets suffused with a feeling of unease, which originates in  the humanist value system presenting itself in a euphemism (a ‘cultural  misunderstanding’; Madd 216) for a behavior that among humans would  be considered rape, but that the yet-unfinished humans cannot be held  responsible for. the Crakers’ subjectivity is thus constantly undermined  by a stream of commentary that reduces them to children and points  out their potential to become human, instead of accepting difference,  complexity, and hybridity. the reader has no other choice but to view  the Crakers through this deeply humanist lens, hoping that ‘[g]iven  time, even the Children of Crake may come to count as human, as their  language develops, as they mythologize and epigeneticize’ (Cooke 123).  3 italics are used by the text to mark both authentic dialogue between  characters and inauthentic interior dialogues toby has with herself – for  example imagining to explain certain terminology to the Crakers (e.g.  ‘immune system’; Madd 101). in both cases, the narrative voice remains  toby’s. </page> <page sequence="36"> 106 Biopunk Dystopias 3.3.2 Nature, Culture, and Xenogenesis: Becoming (Post)Human and indeed, at the heart of the trilogy is the question of human nature,  as Margaret atwood herself has put it: ‘What features are at the core of  our being? What a piece of work is man, and now that we ourselves can  be the workmen, what bits shall we chop off? What is it to be human?’  (‘My Life’ 162). in the trilogy, she explores these questions extensively  through her human characters, as well as through the Crakers. Especially  in regard to her depiction of the Crakers, there are noticeable contra- dictions, though, because the narrative simul ta ne ously presents them as  both potential humans and inaccessible other. By stylizing snowman as guardian, storyteller, and shaper of Craker  culture, atwood instills in her narrative the assurance that human  nature is defined by those aspects which Crake tried to eliminate: ‘the  centrality of the creation of symbols and metaphors’ (Bosco 164). But  the elimination failed, atwood suggests, when claiming that ‘art and  religion – and particularly narrative – are wired in’ (cited in Mckay),  are inherent to human Dna and thus waiting to manifest in Craker  Dna as well. so it is little wonder that many critics agree with atwood  in viewing the Crakers as inhuman-becoming-human and in need of  humanist values and concepts to ‘reach their full potential’ (Brydon 453)  and become human: ‘yet what snowman finds his charges needing most  [...] is, precisely, culture: explanation, understanding, stories of origin  and purpose [...] the need for meaning lies too deep in human nature,  it seems, for even Crake to have eradicated it’ (Deresiewicz 30). similarly,  Canavan argues, the Crakers lack ‘the creative vitality of humanistic  thought – and they only begin to seem potentially worthy successors  to Homo sapiens to the extent that they turn out to retain this capacity  after all’ (147). understanding the Crakers as simple and ‘limited,’ as  subhuman (by intellectual standards), Francoise and Jeff storey argue  that snowman provides them with basic instructions, educates them in a  primitive ‘second nature,’ an act that amounts to ‘creating and recording  History, [...] the human urge to do this is compulsive and inescapable’  (136; see also Bosco 165). there is another side to the Crakers, though, which has prompted  critics to analyze them as a ‘pastoral fantasy’ of ecological humanism, in  which the ‘wildness’ has been bred out of humankind, ‘creating a species  of human beings that will be congenitally unable to soil the planetary  oikos’ (Bergthaller 735). in this reading, the genetically modified human  ‘allegorize[s] the radical transformation [...] necessary in order to save  the planet’ (Canavan 152). For ‘us’ not to be a threat to nature any  longer, we would need to become like the Crakers, ‘noble savages perfect  </page> <page sequence="37"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 107 in every way [...] physically, biologically, in their social relationships as  well as in their existential experience’ (Jameson, ‘then you are them’  7). in this reading, though, a human future would have to leave behind  parts of what humanism considers human nature, as parry argues: the Crakers, then, may be peaceful and vegetarian, incapable of  violence and content to live simply and harmoniously on a diet of  grass and berries, but they are also incapable of abstract thought, of  art or poetry or self-reflection [...] For all their virtues, the Crakers  are clearly something less than human. (252) But read as abstract environmental fantasy, the Crakers remain outside of  ‘our’ reach: ‘no matter how we try, we could never become the Crakers,  nor (as with their caecotrophy) can we really even understand their  subjectivity and the way they see the world’ (Canavan 154). the future  would only be possible for them: ‘hope, but not for us,’ as Canavan titles  his reading of the novels. the true critical posthuman potential, in my opinion, lies in the  middle and in realizing that the ‘end of one understanding of the  human is the beginning of another,’ that ‘what counts as human will  shift’ (Cooke 123). the Crakers – and this is contrary to the reading of  human nature manifesting itself in Dna – are not simply defined by  their genetics alone. they are also participating in what Bernard stiegler  introduces as ‘epigenetic’ and ‘epiphylogenetic memory’ (177) and  reserves solely for the human – the cultural memory, into which they  are born and which exists beyond them, and the technological support  structure that ensures its existence beyond the individual death (e.g.  technological artifacts, but also language and history). Grayson Cooke  argues that Oryx and Crake foregrounds the destruction of these support  structures, effectively staging the end of the human: Without the epigenetic and epiphylogenetic function of language  and technics, atwood suggests that there would be no human, only  meaningless questions and meaningless answers – the meaning- lessness of toast without a toaster, for instance. the human is always  in flux, always becoming, always materializing, transducing, taking  itself apart, putting itself back together, dis- and re-membering.  Without memory, however, and therefore without memory supports,  there can be no re-membering. (Cooke 122) Concerning the human (i.e. only snowman in Oryx) this might be true,  but Cooke ignores the fact that the Crakers possess epigenetic memory  </page> <page sequence="38"> 108 Biopunk Dystopias as well. ‘Language is a perfect example. it is not genetic; it is acquired,  and yet it has its own history, its own genealogy, its own memory that  exceeds the individual. in entering into language, it creates a past for  us, and we acquire this past, which we continue as our own’ (Barnet).  the Crakers experience a different but similar epigenetic event – they  are born into a language and they shape it – later word creations like  ‘the pig ones’ attest to that. it is true that human culture as Jimmy  experienced it has become lacking a referent, but the environment  around the Crakers is just as much determinant for their culture. so,  when Ralph pordzik argues that ‘natural environment, the human  body, and cultural production are intrinsically connected, each evolving  in response to another’s position or activity in a complex network of  relationships’ (155), this holds true for Craker evolution also. When  snowman is missing, feverishly wandering the Compounds, they erect  a statue to remind them of him. the stand-in figure, representative of  the absence of snowman but also a memory technique, becomes their  first epiphylo genetic event, ‘marking the first semiotic space in their  culture: by distinguishing absence from presence and thus reintroducing  into their discourse a new essential dichotomy’ (pordzik 155). With the continuation of the plot in MaddAddam, epiphylogenetic  memory is continued, as the Crakers learn about writing and set down  words to materially remain in memory beyond the individual death: now i have added to the Words, and have set down those things  that happened after toby stopped making any of the Writing [...]  i have done this so we will all know of her, and of how we came  to be. and these new Words i have made are called the story of  toby. (Madd 387) How strongly genetic and epigenetic events interact to shape the culture  becomes clear, once more, in terms of the mating cycle of the Crakers.  the Maddaddam group discuss the epigenetics of the Crakers: How much of Craker behaviour is inherited, how much is cultural?  Do they even have what you could call a culture, separate from the  expression of their genes? [...] the mating cycle is genetic, obviously  [...] as are the changes in the female abdominal and genital pigmen- tation that accompany estrus, and the male equivalent, leading to  the polysexual acts. (Madd 139) Later, when Crakers and humans have had more cultural interaction, and  epigenetic experiences of language have shaped both species, the Crakers  </page> <page sequence="39"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 109 record their cultural adaptation of this genetically shaped behavior – as  it evolved in the complex relationship of the Crakers living with the  humans – and hand it over into epiphylogenetic memory: [o]ur Beloved three oryx Mothers, who showed us that we and  the two-skinned ones are all people and helpers, though we have  different gifts, and some of us turn blue and some do not. so toby  said we must be respectful, and always ask first, to see if a woman  is really blue or is just smelling blue, when there is a question  about blue things. (Madd 386) as i have noted, both humans and Crakers are shaped by the encounters  and interactions; both adapt and form a new culture. ku argues, ‘the  Crakers dilute humanity insidiously. Even though they remain human in  form, their eyes, bones, flesh and body odor are extracted from jellyfish,  coral, mango, and citrus fruit’ (115). this is true only in terms of genetics,  while at the same time, human epigenesis and epiphylogenesis shapes  the Crakers – the categorial uncertainty is doubly present, both for the  human and for the non-human. in the end, it might be the hybridity  of both that allows for a posthuman utopian horizon to open up. the utopian potential inherent in atwood’s trilogy lies neither in  the Crakers becoming fully endowed with humanist values nor in the  extinction of the human and a ‘hope, but not for us’ – it rather lies  in the critical posthuman subjectivity that sees both groups as the  ultimate ‘companion species.’ Haraway argues that ‘to companion is “to  consort, to keep company,” with sexual and generative connotations  always ready to erupt’ (When Species 17), while ‘species’ refers to the  act of seeing similarity and difference. in biology the term signifies ‘the  dance linking kin and kind. the ability to interbreed reproductively is  the rough and ready requirement for members of the same biological  species’ (When Species 17). Consorting with and crossing the boundaries  of species is possible for Haraway in many ways (e.g. she speaks of  ‘symbiogenesis,’ of being licked by her dog; When Species 15), but in the  case of Craker–human interaction, the ultimate companionship might  prove the interbreeding of species. in a discussion of a biological marker for humanity, ivory Bill – one  of the Maddaddam group – adheres to the above definition of species,  arguing that if the Crakers can ‘crossbreed with us, then case [for  their humanity] made. same species. if not, then not’ (Madd 206). But  Manatee, another member, invokes the fertility of the next generation  as key marker, reminding everyone of the mule as sterile hybrid: ‘We  wouldn’t know for sure until the next generation’ (Madd 207). the  </page> <page sequence="40"> 110 Biopunk Dystopias discussion rages on, especially in regard to the different sexual functions  and their genetically induced signals (‘the woman has to be in heat’;  Madd 208). When White sedge, a female member of the group, remarks  that ‘Women aren’t dogs’ (Madd 208) and is offended at the discussion,  the inherent problem of the distinguishing marker of biology becomes  clear – it once more establishes a humanist discourse of mechanized  nature, reducing species inter action to simple biomechanical functions  and women’s sexuality to a sort of simplistic instrument to determine  ontological difference. How differently the cultural factors come into play can be seen in  the reactions of different female members of the group when confronted  with their pregnancy. Where as the scientist swift Fox is cheerful and  jokingly remarks about the paternity of her children (twins, as it turns  out) – ‘i’ve been doing an experiment in genetic evolution. Reproduction  of the fittest. think of me as a petri dish’ (Madd 273) – both amanda  and Ren, who have had no say in getting pregnant, are afraid that their  children might be ‘Frankenbabies,’ fathered by a ‘gene-spliced weirdo  monster’ (Madd 216). swift Fox’s remark is important, as both she and  amanda had sexual intercourse with Crakers and humans – the birth of  hybrid children would signal a strong genetic dominance. and indeed,  all four children are Craker–human hybrids, at birth only noticeable  through the ‘green eyes of the Crakers,’ but raising the question, ‘What  other features might these children have inherited?’ (Madd 380). atwood leaves the future and the final determination of species  equality open (whether the hybrids themselves can have children), but  adds that the group grows, through human, Craker, and hybrid children  alike. in this potential for a hybrid, multiple, and changing humanity  (both genetically and epigenetically) lies the critical posthuman potential:  ‘the Crakers also help us to remember that as a species, humans are not  exempt from adaptations and mutations that occur through processes  of evolution, despite our various advances’ (Rozelle 69). nonetheless, as  mentioned above, this posthuman utopian potential is at least somewhat  relativized by the narrative’s commentary based in humanist values and  the conflicted depiction of the posthumans as inhuman and inferior. in contrast to atwood’s novels, where Craker–human hybridity is  possibly the only option to imagine a future for any humanity (evolved  or otherwise), as most human life has simply been wiped out, in paolo  Bacigalupi’s The Windup Girl the human and the posthuman vie for the  same natural niche in an overextended ecosystem, both claiming the top  position of the proverbial food chain. What in atwood’s trilogy becomes  an experiment in communal survival, in The Windup Girl promises to  be an outright evolutionary conflict. in Emiko, Bacigalupi enacts the  </page> <page sequence="41"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 111 empowerment of the posthuman species that is culturally and genetically  controlled and held in servile positions. Having been rejected from her ‘natural’ habitat as a companion (in  Haraway’s definition of someone to be with, socially and sexually),  Emiko struggles with a genetic contradiction that her training is supposed  to mask: Mizumi-sensei taught that there are two parts to a new person’s  nature. the evil half, ruled by the animal hungers of their genes,  by the many splicings and additions that changed them into what  they were. and balanced against this, the civilized self, the side  that knows the difference between niche and animal urge. that  comprehends its place in the hierarchies of their country and  people, and appreciates the gift their patrons provide by giving  them life. [...] two sides of a coin, two sides of the soul. Mizumi- sensei helped them own their souls. prepared them for the honor  of service. (Windup 154) Here, cultural training (the human side) is supposed to keep in check  the natural urges (the animal side) of Emiko’s being, which is ironic, as  it is due to the genetic splicing that the urge to obey has been triggered  in her in the first place. nonetheless, after the abandonment by her  master, Emiko is confronted with a living environment that negates  if not reverses the training – when she is maltreated and debased, her  internal struggle grows and she wishes to resist her genetics. the strength  of this desire is obvious when she is raped and sees herself manipulated  by the far-removed geneticists that created her, that forced her body  into obedience and sexual willingness: ‘Her body performs just as it  was designed – just as the scientists with their test tubes intended. she  cannot control it no matter how much she despises it. the scientists will  not allow her even this small disobedience. she comes’ (Windup 38). in the beginning Emiko’s resistance is passive. she expresses contempt  through thoughts and words, shows her emotions but is swiftly punished,  but when Emiko hears about enclaves of escaped windups living in  freedom, she realizes that a possibility to resist her Dna exists. Emiko  is left ‘alone with a pounding heart and a sudden urge to live’ (Windup  46). this desire to survive supersedes all genetic obedience programming  and she actively begins to plan an escape and to assert herself as an  empowered subject. it takes her a while to realize, but when she is  confronted with certain death, she manifests extraordinary abilities  such as superhuman speed and extremely powerful body coordi nation:  ‘Emiko watches them, puzzled. they are halfway across the roof, but  </page> <page sequence="42"> 112 Biopunk Dystopias they are so very very slow [...] their every motion drags [...] so slow  [...] Emiko smiles. optimal. she steps up onto the roof ledge’ (Windup  199). she escapes the clutches of the environment ministry’s agents,  becoming fully aware of how ‘optimal’ she is in terms of physique. Her  body can withstand much more than any human’s and she begins to  realize her potential. she becomes self-assertive and empowered, starts  to feel her embodiment not as a prison but as a gift and fully embraces  her subjectivity: she is new people, and she moves through the crowds so smoothly  that they do not know she is there. she laughs at them. Laughs  and slips between them. there is something suicidal ticking in  her windup nature. she hides in the open. she does not scuttle.  Fate has cupped her in its protective hands. she slips through the  crowds, people jerking away startled from the windup in their  midst, from the bit of transgressive manufactuary that has the  effrontery to stain their side walks, as if their land were half as  pristine as the islands that have ejected her. she wrinkles her nose.  Even nippon’s effluent is too good for this raucous stinking place.  they simply do not recognize how she graces them. she laughs to  herself, and realizes when others look at her that she has laughed  out loud. (Windup 252–53) so when the next onslaught of rape and abuse comes, Emiko’s flight  to freedom slowly dies inside, and ‘the falcon if there is any falcon in  Emiko at all, if it ever existed, is a dead thing, dangling. not meant  to live or fly or escape. Meant to do nothing but submit’ (Windup  257). this time, she is pushed too far, though, and realizes that she  has nothing left to lose: ‘she is dead [...] the falcon lies dead. and  then she thinks that some things are worse than dying. some things  can never be borne. Her fist is very fast. Raleigh-san’s throat is soft’  (Windup 259). she kills not only her captor but also the men that have  debased her – 11 men dead within seconds: ‘His eminence the somdet  Chaopraya’s neck has been ripped entirely away, breaking it, snapping  and tearing so that though the spine seems attached still, it acts as a  hinge rather than a support. “it looks like a demon tore him open”’  (Windup 280). at this point, the posthuman, culturally relegated to an inferior and  servile position, asserts itself and realizes its full potential and natural  superiority to the human. Emiko’s act of survival reveals the underlying  conflict of evolution and finally triggers open war fare in the city, between  conservative and progressive forces, represented in the two ministries of  </page> <page sequence="43"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 113 Environment and trade. When the smoke clears, thousands have been  killed, Bangkok has been flooded, and most humans have fled the city.  Emiko remains, surviving and symbolically claiming the remnants of  human civilization as her own: ‘the days pass. she becomes comfortable  entirely in her world of water and scavenge’ (Windup 356). in fact, in  the new physical environment, Emiko is the better-suited species: ‘in  the genetic warfare of Bacigalupi’s world, they have a great advantage,  for the moment, when it comes to surviving filth, pollution, and bodily  waste’ (sullivan 521). By depicting Emiko’s empowerment and resistance  against her mistreatment, Bacigalupi stresses the post human potential  for change and a radical new subjectivity. Emiko emancipates herself  from the inferior position, proving self-assertion and self-reliance, and  she thus cleverly undermines the nature/culture divide and her servile  ‘natural’ position. What is more, though, Bacigalupi – just like atwood – adds the  dimension of miscegenation and procreation to the commentary on a  possible posthuman future. Emiko’s physical otherness, in contrast to  the Crakers’ otherness, does not lead to reactions of fright and ‘cultural  misunderstanding’; on the contrary: Her perfect skin and natural beauty  make her an object of desire and fascination. the monstrous in her  brings forth ‘simultaneous repulsion and attraction,’ her body becomes  ‘dangerously entic[ing]’ (J. Cohen 17, 19), and both Emiko and the  calorie man anderson Lake (who is the main human reflector) describe  the uncertainty of the attraction. at the core of the representation  of Emiko’s sexuality is the question of whether she is in control of  it or her genetic programming is. Lake thinks: ‘Does she wish this?  or only acquiesce? is she even capable of refusing? Her breasts press  against him. Her hands slip down his body. He’s shaking. trembling  like a sixteen-year-old boy. Did the geneticists embed her Dna with  pheromones? Her body is intoxicating’ (Windup 115–16). Lake does not  understand the attraction, feels compelled by invisible Dna and clever  posthuman design – he is constantly aware of her otherness and is  drawn in by it. Emiko, on the other hand, seems capable of forgetting her otherness  only in exactly those moments – losing her non-human nature when  her cultural and genetic programming is so effectively fulfilled: Emiko is surprised at how happy she is that he delights in her, that  he runs his hands over her skin, that he wishes to touch her [...]  it is a relief to be loved, even if it is only for her physicality [...]  Emiko presses herself to him, and their mouths find one another,  and for a time she forgets entirely that people call her windup and  </page> <page sequence="44"> 114 Biopunk Dystopias heechy-keechy. For a moment she feels entirely human, and she loses  herself in the touching. in anderson-sama’s skin. in the security  of pleasure and duty. (Windup 221) the union of human and posthuman thus negates their respective  categories: Lake, the human, becomes fascinated and drawn into a  posthuman subjectivity and wants to understand Emiko’s programming  and the genetic machinations of her actions. Emiko, though, forgets  her Dna and her otherness; she becomes human in the act of sexual  intercourse. in both cases, the subjective narrative position allows the  reader to connect the respective desires, see the similarity and the  complementation. the posthuman–human intercourse opens a utopian  potential and blurs the subjective positions of each. But it does not produce hybrid offspring, as does the relation of  species in atwood’s trilogy. on the contrary, the most important aspect  of a natural sexuality – that of procreation – has been forcibly removed  from new people. in a longing moment, Emiko discusses the lessons  learned from cheshires: ‘Just think if they had made new people first  [...] Generippers learned too much from cheshires’ (Windup 114). Lake  realizes the threatening potential behind such longing, and the security  embedded in Emiko’s Dna: she doesn’t say anything else, but anderson can guess what’s in  her mind. if her kind had come first, before the generippers knew  better, she would not have been made sterile. she would not have  the signature tick-tock motions that make her so physically obvious  [...] Without the lesson of the cheshires, Emiko might have had  the opportunity to supplant the human species entirely with her  own improved version. instead, she is a genetic dead end. Doomed  to a single life cycle, just like soypRo and totalnutrient Wheat.  (Windup 114) the potential for new people to replace the human population is the  threat that looms over the story and shines through every aspect of her  depiction: it can be found in Emiko’s better resistance to any of the  genetically engineered diseases, in her physical superiority – a geisha  with the powers of a supersoldier – in the desire she evokes in men, but  also in her creation with markers of otherness, in her movement, her  overheating, and the obedience genes, her strict cultural training and  integration into a hierarchical society. new people, the story suggests, are  far better suited for the new world, but humans fear them and shackle  them to their Dna. Expressed through the words of generipper Gibbons  </page> <page sequence="45"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 115 and suffused with the hubris of a god (‘the world is ours’), the novel’s  underlying message becomes clear, though: We should all be windups by now. it’s easier to build a person  impervious to blister rust than to protect an earlier version of the  human creature. a generation from now, we could be well-suited for  our new environment. your children could be the beneficiaries. yet  you people refuse to adapt. you cling to some idea of a humanity  that evolved in concert with your environment over millennia,  and which you now, perversely, refuse to remain in lockstep with. Blister rust is our environment. Cibiscosis. Genehack weevil.  Cheshires. they have adapted. Quibble as you like about whether  they evolved naturally or not. our environment has changed. if we  wish to remain at the top of our food chain, we will evolve. or we  will refuse, and go the way of the dinosaurs and Felis domesticus.  Evolve or die. it has always been nature’s guiding principle. (Windup  243) in this speech, Gibbons undermines the human position as exceptional  and superior and prophesizes its replacement – through simply  evolutionary necessity. in his view, ‘hope, but not for us’ is fully  acceptable and thus it is little wonder when he becomes the agent of  change and the posthuman utopian potential in the end of the novel.  Gibbons meets Emiko and stages himself like a god pleased with his  own creation, showing off how much he knows about her. in their  conversation, Gibbons proves sympathetic to new people and offers a  future unimagined by Emiko before: the windup movement is not a required trait. there is no reason it  couldn’t be removed. sterility [...] Limitations can be stripped away.  the safeties are there because of lessons learned, but they are not  required; some of them even make it more difficult to create you.  nothing about you is inevitable [...] someday, perhaps, all people  will be new people and you will look back on us as we now look  back at the poor neanderthals [...] you cannot be changed, but  your children – in genetic terms, if not physical ones – they can  be made fertile, a part of the natural world. (Windup 358–59) as Heather sullivan argues, ‘Bacigalupi’s novel embraces,’ fully realized  in Gibbons’s offer to create non-sterile new people, ‘the reproductive  option for its creature’ (522), and thus projects a truly posthuman  future and the eventual replacement of the human. But just as atwood’s  </page> <page sequence="46"> 116 Biopunk Dystopias trilogy concludes with a continuum of human–posthuman possibilities,  a future as potentially utopian as it is dystopian, so Bacigalupi’s novel  shows ‘Emiko and her projected posthuman progeny [...] poised, like  the genetically-engineered cheshires in relation to the feline predecessors  they decimated through competition, to put a challenge to the concrete  structures of technoscience, geopolitics, ecology, economy, “nature,” and  the “human being”’ (Hageman 298). 3.4 Posthumanism and the Interregnum as we have seen, both Margaret atwood and paolo Bacigalupi imagine  a world of ecological disaster, caused by the human inability to see the  consequences of its hypercapitalist endeavors and the environmental  changes caused by the anthropocene. as such, both worlds are dystopian  extrapolations from the liquid modern realities of contemporary society  and represent a creative intervention into recent sociological discourse.  in both cases, though, the authors go further in their criticism, when  they reveal that humanity is challenged by new forms of life, mainly  in the guise of genetically engineered animals and posthumans – all  of which are, again, products of the same hypercapitalist tendencies  that have been revealed as existent today. in dissolving the boundaries  between humans and others, be they non-human animal, inhuman, or  posthuman, both atwood and Baci galupi revoke the humanist subject  position as superior and exceptional. in atwood’s case, even though humanist ideals and values remain at  the heart of her commentary, the satirical depiction of a hybridized future  nonetheless contains the possibility of a critical posthumanist subjec- tivity in the hybridization of society. Within the dystopian landscape  of her novels, the community of pigoons, humans, and Crakers, with  its hybrid, complex, and shifting conceptions of subjectivity, is poised  to become a new form of society that incorporates a zoe-centric view of  life and fosters interconnected relations between different species, earth,  and technology – thus a truly posthuman society. in Bacigalupi’s world, the critical posthumanist position is more  vocal, in that he allows the posthuman perspective its own narrative  voice and thus a connection with the reader. But just as with atwood,  the dystopian surroundings of the world dominate the new subjectivity.  the human suppresses posthuman technology through the mechanics  of consumer society and relentlessly hunts genetically altered creatures  without mercy. But the representation of suffering and torture in the  posthuman is exactly what connects the reader to its subjective position  </page> <page sequence="47"> tHE antHRopoCEnE, tHE postHuMan, anD tHE aniMaL 117 and thus allows for the conceptual space of post humanity to take hold.  in the end, as with atwood, humanity is destroyed (or at least in retreat  from the novel’s locale) and the posthuman is once more waiting to take  charge, to step in and reveal itself to be the ‘better option’ for survival,  the ecological alternative to the destruction represented in humanity. Both authors thus express a position on the brink of a radical transfor- mation, at the end of the conceptual security of what it means to be  ‘human’ and already deep in the process of altering the social, ecological,  and ontological make-up of their respective worlds. in their fiction, the  human is a concept of the past and cannot capture the realities of an  interconnected life on earth. But the new zoe-centric concept to grasp  the possi bilities that lie ahead has not established itself yet. in Bauman’s terms, then, both authors allegorically describe a  moment of interregnum, that ‘extraordinary situation’ when the social,  political, and cultural frame has lost its grip and ‘a new frame, made  to the measure of the newly emerged conditions [...] is still at the  design stage, has not yet been fully assembled’ (44 Letters 120). What  is so radical about the fictional interregnum presented in atwood  and Bacigalupi is that they posit not simply a political sovereignty  that is ‘underdefined and contentious, porous and poorly defensible,  unanchored and free-floating’ (Bauman, 44 Letters 120) but the human  condition itself. the interregnum described is that of a time in which  the human has come under attack and the new, posthuman condition  is the concept that is still under defined, porous, and free-floating. the  moment described in the novels, the interregnum between the human  and something that follows in its stead, is still undecided – posthuman  subjectivity is just on the brink of fully realizing itself. as such, the  novels propagate the utopian possibility to explore an alternative in the  reader’s present, to already allow for a posthumanist perspective. they  stage, as Eric otto suggests, a productive tension between what is (im)possible for their protag- onists and what is still possible for us. there are social, political,  economic, and cultural forces that work against the realization of  ecologically and socially better ways of being today. But these forces  have not fully interrupted our ability to care for nonhuman species  [...] to balance economic and cultural production with reproduction  [...] and to disseminate the understanding that the human body,  like all other species’ bodies, is always in ecosystems.
