<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADAM MILOBEDZKI Architecture in Wood: Technology, Symbolic Content, Art 1. Myth and History Quinlan Terry's Rustic Hut in West Green, England (1980), is not only a Post-Modern pastiche of an eighteenth-century garden temple [Fig. 1]. It is also yet another typical example of the relationship between history and art over the past two hundred years, when with each new interest in a period, style, or creator of a work of the past, a conceptual basis has been set up for a contemporary, historically oriented imitation of this art. In the case at hand, the imitation in wood of the archaic Doric temple, so sophisticated because of its deliberate inclusion of the barbarous, seems to refer to Joseph Rykwert's by-now-classic book, published in 1972, on the primitive hut in the history of architecture.' And in fact, the Rustic Hut, as Terry himself admits,2 follows closely the illustrations for Sir William Chambers' treatise,3 and Rykwert recently reproduced these illustrations together with his discussion of Chambers' ideas.4 In his book, Rykwert presents an exhaustive contemporary examination of the importance primitive wood structures have had in the evolutionary theory of architecture and the historical- philosophical concepts connected with it. This theory is based, of course, on Vitruvius' concept of the mimetic- naturalistic origins of architecture, with architectural orders of columns coming basically from forest dwellings built in of branches and rough-hewn logs. In keeping with this idea, Philibert Delorme introduced a column in the shape of a tree trunk into his architecture [Fig. 2].5 The existence of this archetype of the hut in Vitruvius, as well as in some biblical passages and even in the myth of Daedalus, indicates that in European culture the mythical origins of architecture have been sought in wooden, rather than in stone buildings. Primitive wooden structures have thus been associated with civilization's earliest stages of development, and that is why in the Age of Humanism, representations of such structures not only were used to illustrate architectural treatises but also appeared in paintings and engravings that evoked the earliest history of mankind.6 This was connected, more or less indirectly, with the Humanist cult of rural, pastoral life, or, more particularly, with Neo-Stoicism. As a consequence, certain metaphorical and symbolic meanings were attached to buildings in wood.7 Throughout the history of architecture, the use of stone has always been posited in opposition to wood, with stone thought of as lasting, stable, and possessing basic metaphysical and cosmological values, while wood was considered temporary, to a certain extent mobile, and easy and quick to construct and adapt to day-to-day practical needs.8 During the Renaissance, these differences became even more polarized and were connected to changes in the language of art. With the new contrast between traditional and modern, between classical and a less rigorous expression in architecture, came the classification of works of literature and art into "high" (heroic) and "low" (pastoral) styles, or, more often, a three- way classification into "high," "middle," and "low" styles.9 These classifications, derived from ancient rhetorical and poetic theory, stressed, in accordance with cultural conventions, the relationship between artistic forms and the 177</page><page sequence="2">social status of the client for whom a given work was made, or whom it was supposed to serve. Of course, in Humanist circles, architecture built in wood could only belong to the "low" style, including works in what was called the "rustic style,"10 which was exemplified by Peruzzi-Serlio's triple stage design, where wood, and especially wooden huts [Fig. 3], were meant-for the "lowest" level of stage plays, i.e., satire.11 In the eighteenth century, all these ideas began to function within the philosophical framework and social concepts of the Enlightenment. The Vitruvian myth of the origin of architecture in wooden structures became an integral part of Classical doctrine. The "Vernacular Classicism" of the earliest buildings, made of logs, was supposed to establish the legitimacy of classical architecture as a universal system based on natural law, in the same way that primitive people were supposed to be evidence of the evolution of social systems and of civilization in harmony with nature.12 However, from about 1700, wooden huts illustrating architectural treatises slowly developed in the direction indicated by the philosophical and scientific revolution of the seventeenth century.13 They increasingly came to be a starting point for pavilions used in landscape gardens, broke away from Classicism and the Enlightenment, and, being closely defined as to time and place, became in various ways symbols of different civilizations idealized by Romanticism. "Vernacular Classicism" gave way to architecture par/ante, myth to history. The Vitruvian hut was replaced by the chalet suisse,14 which came from folklore by way of garden architecture [Fig. 4], and numerous nineteenth-century pub- lications held up the chalet as an example of cosmopolitan architecture in wood. 1) Q.

The Romantic movement brought a more historical view of architecture which did not attach as much importance as had previously been the rule to the difference between "high" and "low" styles in architecture, not to mention between structures in masonry and those in wood. The idea which had prevailed for over two thousand years, that architecture was a universal system, an organic part of the natural order of the universe, was fading away by the end of the eighteenth century, and ever since then, the ways in which architecture in wood has been characterized, classified, and understood have varied according to contemporary perspectives on research and historical interpretation. In Germany, France, and England, the history of architecture was reconceived as a research discipline,15 based on a new concept of architecture as an autonomous, self-referential system with clearly defined technical, utilitarian, and artistic aspects.16</page><page sequence="3">At the earliest stage in the development of the new history of architecture, the ideas of Romanticism and scientism were thought of as non-conflicting concepts, and structures in wood were cited in discussions of the origins of architecture and the way it evolved. In these discussions, both older and more recent myths, like the idea that Gothic architecture is an imitation of a forest,17 were contrasted with more concrete archeological, ethnological, and philological facts. More direct research into wooden architecture followed in the second half of the nineteenth century with pioneers in the systematic study of Gothic art like Viollet-le-Duc [Fig. 5].18 These scholars could not help but notice that the same forms of detail and decoration used by medieval stonemasons were employed in the picturesque timber-framed townhouses, as well as in the sporadic remains of medieval religious and public buildings in wood. Norwegian and Polish wooden churches, among others [Figs. 6, 7], attracted attention in the mid-nineteenth century, though it was only towards the end of the century that they began to be studied more systematically.19 Interest in structures in wood continued to grow among historians of architecture, especially in the German-speaking 3) Rustic hut in Peruzzi-Serlio's stage design.

They examined, for the most part, provincial preindustrial environments of Central, East-Central, and Northern Europe, and primarily wooden constructions up until the twentieth century. The ethnographic school of study excluded architecture for the upper classes, which was mainly identified with masonry. One should point out that in this field, regardless of one's approach, architecture in wood has so far usually been viewed as a category separate from formal "high- style" architecture. This has mainly been the result of the trend to classify and delimit subjects in a way typical of nineteenth-century scientific thought, and this is reflected in piecemeal interpretations of architecture in wood, e.g., as mere products of the carpenter's trade, or as evidence of the survival of forms from prehistoric cultures, or as the result of the physical environment of a given region, etc. Treating European buildings in wood as "non-historical" examples of a regional cultural heritage, much as is done in ethnographic studies of "primitive" or exotic societies, comes of course from Romanticism,25 and, especially in Central Europe, from the Romantic idealization of the peasantry, and an unflinching trust that in this peasant culture the authentic, unchanged traits of national tradition have been preserved. This static picture of "folk architecture" remained unaffected even by positivistic evolutionary theory, according to which complicated buildings are supposed to have evolved from simpler ones, which has not always been the case. The result has been, in tracing this evolution, the at times mistaken grouping of wooden churches and country houses of clearly outstanding style with examples of "folk architecture," despite the fact that the former were designed for the upper classes by professional architects. All these concepts associated with nationalistic and political preconceptions have given rise to other distortions, as well. Symbols of national identity have been sought in "folk" buildings, often of more recent origin. This has happened with nations deprived of their political independence, as Poland was in the nineteenth century,26 and with new nations whose history until the twentieth century was pretty much restricted to within the boundaries of their own region; which had no real upper classes of their own to speak of, and which had recently obtained their independence, such as Slovakia, or some of the Balkan nations. An extreme example of politically motivated chauvinism and exaggeration of the cult of the peasantry, has been the theory that Russian Orthodox wooden tower churches were supposed to have been the prototype for similar churches 181</page><page sequence="6">8) Fortress in Tichvin, Russia, c. 1625. Drawing, 1679. From M. Miltschik. in masonry,27 while in reality just the opposite is true. In fact, the model for the masonry churches comes from theoretical concepts current in the circles of Filarete and Francesco di Giorgio, which were brought to Moscow by Lombard architects at the turn of the sixteenth century.28 The same may be said of Russian log fortresses of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries,29 which were imitations in wood of the Lombard systems of fortification used in the kremlins of Moscow and Zagorsk [Fig. 8]. Undoubtedly the highest standard of methodology in the study of preindustrial wooden buildings has been attained in German-speaking countries. There, what is called Haus- forschung has described the typology of housing and traced its evolution, above all for buildings in wood, supported by research on all aspects of agricultural society, as well as by such disciplines as the study of prehistoric times, philology and later on linguistics, and the overall history of culture. However, owing to the political divisions in the German-speaking area, for a long time numerous restricted studies were produced on countries of various sizes, which fostered an exaggerated 182 regionalism in their approach; this has only started to break down in the second half of this century.30 In the first decades of the twentieth century, a scholar appeared on the scene who aimed at the broadest possible kind of synthesis, while at the same time employing a great deal of fantasy. Josef Strzygowski was the first art historian to bring together organically the findings of various disciplines: archaeology, ethnology, and the history of art and architecture. He connected wooden structures, particularly log-technique ones, with Indo-European prehistory, and postulated that many later European structures were to be derived from this a priori model.31 The actual data for buildings in wood was still relatively limited at the time and so, based on the narrow typological spectrum available to him, he arrived at some misleading and superficial conclusions. From Polish historians of architecture and art came the first major attempts to put some historical order into the Romantic, positivist, and neo-Romantic studies of wooden structures dis- cussed above. This process began with Oskar Sosnowski in 1935, who brought out the relationship of Gothic masonry work to "folk" architecture in wood.32 Just after 1950, Czestaw Witold Krassowski shattered the myths of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regarding structures in wood: that of their prehistoric origins and that of the determinism of regional and national factors on them.33 Finally, Ksawery Piwocki did away altogether with the concept of "folk" structures and even of folk art in general. He proved that these do not go back much further than the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, but rather are based on the medieval traditions of the, by then declining, craftsmen's guilds.34 The concepts that Krassowski and Piwocki discredited occasionally still find supporters today, not only in socio- political popularizations but even in specialized works. The backwardness of East European studies of wooden architecture, rarely undertaken on anything more than a simply descriptive level, can be gauged by the fact that nobody had ever managed to achieve a modern and really critical synthesis of architecture in wood until 1968 when Vaclav Mencl finished his brilliant book on folk architecture in Czechoslovakia.35 And even here, the notion of "vernacular architecture" which was then starting to spread in the West and open up new methods of architectural inquiry, did not seem to have reached Mencl yet. Nevertheless, the criteria which he applied in his study of wooden structures were not far off from those applied by contemporary Western scholars to vernacular architecture. It should be added, however, that to speak of all historical wooden buildings as vernacular architecture, as is at present very popular, is a great oversimplification, especially since the definition of this term is continually being sharpened.36 Of course, most European preindustrial buildings in wood can be</page><page sequence="7">defined as vernacular architecture, including the ones Mencl discussed. But there are many structures in wood that do not fit this definition and, therefore, do not really belong to this category. Despite the range of these different research methods and interpretations of wooden architecture, we can see that since the beginning of the last century, wooden structures have held a rather secondary position within the framework of the overall history of architecture. While there has been an enormous output of research in this field, a general synthesis is still to come. Nor has this lack been filled by the current outline histories of European wooden buildings and their construction. The purpose of these is descriptive, and they are particularly meant to illustrate the rich variety of examples, not so much in a historical as in a regional, chronological order.37 The same can be said of the books that have come out from time to time dealing with architecture in wood from one particular angle: as belonging to a particular region or country, or to a period, or to a particular form-class of buildings. On the other hand, it is not surprising that no valid, thoroughgoing synthesis has yet been made, since it is impossible to study the basic problems of structures in wood without fitting them into the overall picture of architecture, or for that matter, of culture. The history of architecture in wood can be considered a separate entity only at lower stages of study, e.g., when collecting source materials, making inventories of objects, examining form or the techniques of carpentry, categorizing into basic types, etc. The contemporary study and criticism of architecture do not give special importance, in their categorization, to material components, so it has now become easier than before to fit architecture in wood into the history of the European visual landscape as a whole. Within this framework, the same complex of modern methods of classification, analysis, and interpretation can be applied to architecture in wood as for architecture in other materials. 2. Material, Technique, and Form The interdependence between man and his home dates back at least to Neolithic times, which means that buildings for shelter had already by that time ceased to be merely accidental and had acquired a systematic character. The form of primitive buildings thus was not just determined by the technical possibilities offered by the material used; dwellings also began to be built on a human scale, and to be adapted to socio-cultural ways of living. One result, for example, was the setting up of geometric guidelines based on anthropomorphic measurements, and another, later, as people began to use wood as a building material, was the standardization of more or less homogeneous structures, such as the trabeated skeleton, the stave wall, or the self-bearing log box. The wooden roof, regardless of the material and technique used in making the walls, seems to have been the key element in these primitive buildings. At this early stage, the roof, especially a pitched one, began to function as an archetypal symbol of shelter and security. One might add that a roof has always been, practically speaking, the most difficult problem a carpenter has to solve. The entire history of European carpentry can be illustrated as a sequence of roof construc- tions, in chronological and topographical order. It should be stressed that for architecture in wood there is an extreme interdependence between the materials and techniques available and the resulting form. This brings us to the problem of determinism by nature, that is, environment, and by the techniques used. In both cases there is a kind of negative determinism, since nature and the techniques used do not so much determine a form in a positive sense, as put limits on the kind of form that can be used. For architecture in wood the greatest limiting factors have always come from the length and thickness of timber, and for hundreds of years these factors, since they limited the ceiling span and specified the scale of feasible roof constructions, also limited, as a consequence, how large the continuous interior space could be. In masonry structures, on the other hand, the diameter of a dome was, at least theoretically, limitless. As far as the relationship between the kinds of timber and carpentry techniques used are concerned, the fact is that coniferous trees yield long, straight timber, and deciduous trees generally have shorter, not quite straight trunks, and this is very important because it explains how the tree types predominating in a region could influence the kind of construction used.38 The proximity of coniferous forests generally corresponded to a prevalence of log-technique and other long-timber constructions, and deciduous forests to a wider range of frame technique, but this should not be oversimplified. For instance, in what has been called Atlantic Europe,39 the roofs of Romanesque churches and noble residences borrowed their long-timber systems of construction from the southern regions where coniferous forests prevailed, although the only thing they could be built with in the north was long oak beams, and these were very hard to come by in the forests there. Their lack began to be felt by the thirteenth century, with the then only recent stabilization of feudal society and a great economic leap forward, as the result of demographic growth, revolutionized agricultural methods, 183</page><page sequence="8">9) J. Amman, (A Carpenter and His Workshop)), woodcut. From H. Sachs. urbanization, etc., all of which brought on a building boom, and consequently a growing shortage of wood. Therefore, new models of frame and truss construction, without the use of long timber, had to be invented.40 At the beginning of modern times, deep forest cover was still abundant in many central and eastern regions, unlike in Western Europe, where forests had to a large extent been devastated due to the growth of industry and the pressures of urbanization.41 Industrial demand for longer timber increased, in particular for the building of navies and merchant fleets, and thus the exploitation of coniferous forests became more profitable than that of deciduous ones. This upset the traditional forest balance between deciduous and coniferous trees and brought with it changes in the dendrological composition of the forests of the Central European flatlands, from which timber was widely exported to supply Western 10) Timber-frame of house in Alsfeld, Herfeldstrasse 10/12, c. 1370. Reconstruction by K. Klockner. European needs. As was noted above, coniferous trees were especially suitable for the log-building technique which, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, came to be used far more than before in vernacular buildings in Central Europe. There may have been more economic than natural reasons for this. The relationship between the development of carpentry techniques [Fig. 9] and the forms used in building has, of course, various aspects to it. On a lower level, this problem must be viewed within the rigid historical framework of the history of substantial architecture.42 The passage from sub- building to substantial architecture in wood had already accelerated in the countries of Atlantic Europe by around the beginning of the second millenium A.D. The more ancient system of stave walls, primitive post-and-beam schemes, and simpler kinds of roofing began to be transformed into more advanced forms of timber-framing at around that time.43 184 _ - NW iK:oI im</page><page sequence="9">11) Synagogue in Grodno, Poland, c. 1770. From K. M. Piechotka. Most likely, later improvement in local rustic carpentry owed a great deal to Roman traditions of building, which were then carried over into the building of Romanesque and early-Gothic cathedrals, abbeys, and noble residences, as well as in constructions in the towns that started to develop in the twelfth century.44 From these building sites the new, improved frame techniques with half-timbered walls and collar roofs spread and became more popular as the middle classes became more affluent, with these techniques then turning into a permanent acquisition of the Gothic building heritage. The basis for all these transformations - so crucial for the history of European architecture as a whole - was laid in the Rhineland, and in the territories of France and England under the Normans. From here developments extended eastward out to the frontiers of the Latinized world, as more and more advanced methods of carpentry were being invented. As a result of their propagation, not only did the use of traditional log structures decrease in Central and Eastern Europe, but when these structures were used, they were at least influenced by the new frame techniques. When and where the more ancient ways of construction gave way to the new ones marks a turning point in the history of European culture. In Atlantic Europe, the disappearance of traditional rural carpentry began already in the thirteenth century. By the nineteenth century the encroachment of the new methods extended up to the ethnic borders of the Eastern Slavs who, with their conservative 12) Typical peasant house in the Orava region, Poland, eighteenth/nineteenth century. From Z. Dmochowski. peasant culture, identified themselves with the anti-Latin, i. e., anti-Gothic tradition of the Orthodox Church. The technical advances in medieval carpentry, which by modern times had reached even the outlying areas of Europe, were characterized above all by sturdier construction and the use of prefabricated frames and trusses [Fig. 10], and what was to have far-reaching consequences, the standardization of the bay system.45 In the later Middle Ages, there seem to have been introduced certain rules of proportion in carpentry structures, which were still applied in country workshops as late as the nineteenth century.46 There is no evidence that in carpentry this use of geometry had any extra-pragmatic function as it did in masonry architecture, which was based on triangles and squares with magical and cosmological implications.47 In modern times, the widespread diffusion of saw mills was of great importance in the formation of higher classes of architecture and their derivatives. The larger-scale, more standardized production of planks influenced the development of wooden sham vaulting, and made possible the shaping of crooked roofs and helm formations, as well as starting a fashion in the decorative laying out of planks [Fig. 1 1]. The center truss was already introduced by the sixteenth century,48 and represented the beginning of a great technological leap forward in construction, which was to lead to the development of modern construction engineering. This engineering made 185</page><page sequence="10">13) Farm house in Trutnowy, Prussia, 1720. Photo from before 1945. possible a kind of building in wood constructed on solid rational, mathematical, and economic bases, and therefore had very little to do with the postmedieval culture that until the end of the ancien regime, had been the principle source for vernacular, and at times even high-style, architecture in wood. From this scientific engineering, quickly harnessed to serve the purposes of the Industrial Revolution, came the complex, highly developed wood constructions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In preindustrial architecture, wood was itself a means of expression, with form directly imposed on construction. The structures and their component parts were visible and tangible, both inside and out, with joints in the construction unconcealed, and this made for a particular clarity of expression in wooden architecture [Fig. 12]. The whole corpus was composed of an open-faced complex of intersecting walls, frames, and trusses, all straight and sharply defined. Regardless of the system of construction, the walls were not only relatively thin, but they tended to have a flat and unsubstantial look on the surface. This especially holds true for timber-framed walls. The skeleton framework, even with the rhythm of the bays clearly demarcated, is flush with the fill-in of the walls, and because of this it looks like two-dimensional decoration. Thus buildings in wood did not offer as much opportunity for sculptured or sculpture-like treatment as was possible in masonry buildings. 186</page><page sequence="11">However, what actually gave particular character to timber- framed structures was to a great extent the skeleton framework itself, with its visible posts, beams, and braces, especially when they were made to contrast with the lighter colored fill-in of the walls. By the sixteenth century, this skeleton at times was loaded down with extra braces, strouts, and other elements not strictly necessary for the construction, in order to create compositional effects [Fig. 13]. Rarely have structures in wood achieved such a high standard of expression corresponding to the real nature of the material. This occurred in England, northern France, and parts of Germany, but not so much elsewhere. When, on higher levels of architecture, wood techniques began to be used in Baroque art to create illusionistic effects [Fig. 11] or, later on, in construction engineering as an artistically neutral material, wood ceased to be a means of expression in itself, and lost its original identity in construction and form. 3. Extra-Technical Factors and Historical Developments Finally, there is the crucial problem of the influence of extra- technical factors on the expressive possibilities of structures in wood or, vice versa, the problem of limitation involved in adapting wooden structures to what can be called the style or spirit of the age. The style of architecture in wood can best be seen in comparison with that in masonry. At certain times and in certain areas, one can see a mutual interplay of influences and stylistic similarities between wood and masonry !1 i t I i ] aS ; I~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ I architecture, while elsewhere, architecture in wood strives, for various reasons, to find an expression of its own; the Gothic period is the best illustration of this. It should be noted that at the start of the development of Gothic models, the primacy of masonry construction in this process was anything but obvious. One may question Walter Horn's otherwise thoughtful thesis on the influence of wooden-frame structures on the masonry bay system in late- Romanesque and early-Gothic churches,49 though we should take into account the influence of wooden construction on how space and structure were viewed by Gothic architects, since their attitude in fact developed concurrently with the standardi- zation of bays in timber structures. Later on, the close-studded variant of the half-timber wall, which was so popular in medieval England, seems most likely to have served as a model for the Perpendicular style with its stone or wood paneling on the walls and its traceried windows [Fig. 14]. Furthermore, within the more general framework of secular Late Gothic and Manneristic architecture in Northern Europe, a certain correspondence can be found between, on the one hand, cage-like timber structures,50 and on the other, the huge, vertical window frames and flat screen-like surfaces of brick walls, towers, turrets, and multi-shaped bay windows [Fig. 15].

From J. Summerson. architecture can also be found in wood, as in Henry VIIl's splendid Nonsuch Palace [Fig. 16]. As for the vocabulary of Gothic forms, motifs like the pointed arch, tracery, ribs, etc., in masonry are identical not only in carpentry but also in other crafts as well,51 which goes to show how style takes precedence over material and technique. Even the pointed arcades dividing the church nave from the side aisles, like the typical ogive doors, were built of wood. This particular form of construction spread from England to Poland [Figs. 17-20], which illustrates in which direction these general trends in medieval carpentry were going.52 In English churches, the occasional replacement, later on, of wooden arcades with masonry ones,53 does not necessarily mean that the original use of timber was only of a temporary character or the result of merely economic considerations, especially since there may not have been any deliberate copying of masonry forms involved. The situation was much the same when a wooden structure was erected as a substitute for something that was technically more difficult to build in masonry, as for example in the extraordinary Octagon in Ely Cathedral (1328-35). The ruins of the stone tower at the crossing were replaced by a wooden superstructure with Decorated articulations, which gave an impression of inventiveness and boldness to the whole, far surpassing the limitations of masonry architecture. 188 The same applies to some examples of wooden sham vaulting with wooden ribs, bosses, and corbels, that appeared in England before 1200 [Fig. 21],54 and became highly developed later under the influence of the vaulting masonry, rich ceilings, and open-timber roofs of the Late Gothic.55 This increase in complexity gave birth to the largest, most ornate, and most ingenious wood creations of the Western world, i. e., hammer-beam roofs [Fig. 5], the magnificent collective achievement of medieval carpenters, joiners, and wood- carvers. 56 Thus, in English high-style architecture, structures in wood were of the same high artistic quality as those in masonry up until the sixteenth century, with both the Royal Master- Carpenter and Royal Master-Mason being the pride and joy of the court workshop, and enjoying equal prestige. However, the medieval clergy and aristocracy, for various reasons, generally tended to prefer stone and brick masonry.57 In the countries where masonry structures became the most popular architectural patterns, they were, as a consequence, copied in wood as well. This is clearly the case in several medieval log churches. These were sometimes erected in regions where stave or half- timber churches had previously been built, or where these techniques were still in use. As compared to stave, half-timber and archaic log buildings, log churches were of marked .. ' , _- ,-</page><page sequence="13">17) Parish church in Marton, England, 1320. From W. Horn, E.

The cubic shapes of these log churches were close to those of masonry churches and, therefore, from the appearance of the first log churches in west-central Sweden in about 1340, they were probably meant to be copies of Romanesque stone churches.58 In Poland, the earliest existing examples of log churches date to at least the beginning of the fifteenth century [Figs. 22-24], and in style are even clearer examples, since in them Late Gothic stone-cutting was clearly copied in the shaping of doors and windows [Figs. 25-27], and in the chamfering of the ground course of logs below.59 Thus, in Central and Northern Europe, Late Gothic wooden churches were, in general, both in architectural syntax as well as in vocabulary of motifs, following the style of masonry work. Similar influences, but mainly restricted to mouldings and decoration, are to be found in timber-framed secular architecture all over Europe [Fig. 28]. Varying degrees of quality in the formal, functional, and technical aspects of Gothic architecture could occur anywhere, and basically only depended on the varying degree of specialization and professional skill of master masons and carpenters. The fact that sharply defined classes of 190</page><page sequence="15">24) Parish church in Debno, Poland, before 1500. Photo S.

Demetrykiewicz. architecture, i.e., a "high style" and a vernacular style, did not develop fits in well with the social and cultural universality of the Latin world. A sharper diversification into architectural classes arose in the sixteenth century, when more and more the elite began to be set apart culturally from the rest of society. At the same time, with the birth of the modern architectural profession and the gradual prevailing of the theory of architecture based on Vitruvius, a separate, "high-style" kind of architecture for the upper classes came into being, based on the rejection by the Renaissance, or more exactly Italianism, of the Late Gothic on principle. From this moment on, the Gothic building tradition was relegated to the lower classes of society [Fig. 29], and ultimately confined to peasant housing. In Central and Eastern Europe, though, this process was not completed until the nineteenth or even the twentieth century [Fig. 30]. Thus vernacular architecture in wood came into its own, and was codified on the basis of traditional Gothic forms [Figs. 31, 32], constructions, and planning models still used in the towns by the local guilds, which were also rather reluctant to accept Renaissance and Mannerist decorative models [Fig. 33], so that the dominant influences on the Baroque were not felt in vernacular architecture until later, in the mid- eighteenth century. In urbanized countries of seventeenth-century Atlantic Europe, the age of the Great Rebuilding began when, due to the general elevation in the level of culture and in living standards as well as because of a growing shortage of wood, the percentage of more solid building in masonry rose and architectural programs became more ornate.60 The result was that practically no noble residences or church buildings were built in wood anymore, and even in the rare cases where wood 192 26) Door of Krzepice parish church, Poland, c. 1466/80. 27) Door of Iwkowa parish church, Poland, before 1500.

Kalinowski. was used for buildings of rank, every effort was made to work on them in the same way as with any piece of "good architecture" in masonry, i.e., camouflaging the timber, in keeping with the Baroque practice of choosing whatever technique was needed for the effect desired. Although the eastern regions of Europe, which were still primarily agricultural, also went through the process of the Great Rebuilding, they initially did so on a smaller scale due to denser forest cover and different socio-economic conditions. But the need for rapid reconstruction after the numerous cataclysms that occurred in these regions from the mid- seventeenth century on, gave rise to a renewed interest in wood. The upper-middle classes, too, which had previously made greater use of masonry work, turned again to building in wood. This was not only the result of widespread poverty, decimation by wars and plagues, and the fact that few local masons survived them. The use of wood even in those constructions intended for the richer and culturally more refined social classes, meant that, at the time in question, wood as a building material had become more highly appreciated, and not only for its practical advantages. This increase in prestige is confirmed by new types of palaces, manor houses, churches, and synagogues in wood [Figs. 11, 34-38], that are Baroque and cosmopolitan, especially in their typology, spatial structure, shaping of volume, and outline.61 There was also very little camouflaging of wood to look like masonry [Figs. 39, 40]. Baroque structures of higher rank, in which timber was not, as elsewhere, camouflaged, appeared all over the northeastern part of Latin Europe - in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in Prussia, Sweden, and the Baltic countries. By the mid- seventeenth century, this kind of architecture, which can be connected to Sarmatism and Nordism, two national subgroups of Baroque culture, had entered the design repertoire of 195 -????</page><page sequence="20">34) G. B. Gisleni, design for the Leszczyiski Palace in Warsaw, c. 1650. From N. Miks-Rudkowska. professional architects [Figs. 34, 39], including some of the most distinguished of these,62 who had been educated in the traditions of masonry architecture and whose ideas on art, just like those of the people they built for, were based on Vitruvianism and its innumerable offshoots. Although this theory in its discussion of history also touched on the problems 35) Manor in Czarnozyty, Poland, 1750. From W. tozirski. of the earliest buildings in wood, as we have seen, it was on the whole more concerned with stone and brick architecture, with metaphysically based geometrical proportions and classical architectural orders. These conceptions of a theoretical order could be transposed to buildings in wood by including slender, decoratively shaped posts, which paraphrased baluster columns and terms [Fig. 37]. Peculiar posts like these can be found in Renaissance and Mannerist pattern books, where they occur in altanas, pergolas, and other garden constructions in wood.63 Both as form and as symbol they may be treated as columns of the lowest, "rustic" mode of architecture, according to the Vitruvian concept that architecture originated in primitive wooden structures.64 However, churches or country houses in wood were constructed by carpenters whose creativity continued to be based mainly on Late Gothic techniques and forms. The Italianate details and decoration which these buildings might feature were usually vulgarized versions of what the more eminent of the master carpenters would borrow from architects, copying in wood motifs from contemporary masonry buildings, sometimes with ingenious modifications. In this way high-style design was often combined with a vernacular interpretation of forms in one and the same building. There is no better example of the great creativity and inventiveness of carpenters and Baroque architects in wood than eighteenth-century synagogues,65 with their unusual forms that show how wood could be used to construct a highly 36) Parish church in Porzecze Mariaiskie, Poland, 1776.

Kornecki. expressive kind of architecture not normally associated with construction in wood and in a way unique to this material, but still in keeping with the stylistic canons of art of the time [Fig. 1 1]. Things changed radically in the nineteenth century, when architects and engineers began to treat buildings in wood the same as buildings in any other kind of material. This leveling process applied not only to ordinary industrial buildings and housing in timber, but also to more elitist architecture in wood that followed the stylistic conventions of the chalet suisse [Fig. 4], the half-timbered cottage, the Shingle Style, the "Zakopane Style,"66 [Fig. 41], or even more individualistic 198 IR i . I L ..... j 39) T. van Gameren, Lubomirski Palace in Czerniak6w, now Warsaw, c. 1687. Survey, c. 1720. creations [Fig. 42]. This was, of course, partly the result of modern principles of engineering, for which the kind of building material and construction to be used depend on the pragmatic needs they were meant to serve.67 An important factor in this regard was the doctrine of Jacques-Nicolas-Louis Durand. He introduced the idea of architecture - which earlier had been seen as a natural system deeply rooted in the culture of ancient times - as an applied science in which the technical, functional, and artistic components were differentiated and, consequently, put on an equal footing.68 More important, most nineteenth-century architecture, whatever its material and formal characteristics, was subject</page><page sequence="23">40) Parish church in Szalowa. Poland, 1753-56. Photo T. Chrzanowski. to the same artistic stimulants and kindled by the same rhetoric, especially that of contemporary aesthetics and art criticism, art history and architectural theory, moralism, social and political doctrines, etc. The way these elements were combined, and the priority each was assigned in the combination, was simply the result of interaction between "rational" awareness and ever changing ideologies, reflecting the flux of scientific progress, and could be decisive in the selection of which formal convention to use. The above- mentioned chalet suisse and half-timbered cottage were just such conventions. However, a complete picture of architecture in the Age of Industrialism must also include the more traditional trends in architecture in wood which appeared in the less developed economic and cultural enclaves of Europe. Being to a certain extent outside the sphere of the dominant influences on architecture in the new industrial society, these provincial buildings of the lower social order were very often belated 199</page><page sequence="24">4 4 41) Stanistaw Witkiewicz, house ((Pod Jedlami?, Zakopane, Poland, 1897. Photo J. twiderski. carry-overs from vernacular architecture of the ancien rdgime [Figs. 30, 31, 43, 44].69 It should be noted, however, that for various reasons this traditional typology in the housing of peasants or craftsmen was at times made use of, in more or less adapted form, by architects or engineers in planning villages and small towns, both in less developed as well as in more highly industrialized regions.70 In fact, it was mainly through the interest of Romanticist and positivistic archaeologists and folklore researchers that preindustrial wood building was brought into contact with the nineteenth-century world of industrialization and "progressive" ideas. Research of this kind led to the 200 appearance of "folk architecture" in the work of architects, as in that of painters and writers. The interest in wooden structures among such groups in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, has been closely linked to the ideas dominant in the society of the time concerning the status, importance, and historical role of architecture in wood. As we said, these opinions had come almost exclusively from researchers in the field of ethnography, or popularizers of their ideas. Since in these countries there prevailed the strong conviction that "folk" building in wood, in its highest expression, was symbolic of national identity and/or social progress, many creative persons in these societies felt it their duty to</page><page sequence="25">incorporate forms from this kind of construction in their art. Over the years, increasing attention was paid not only to authenticity of historical interpretation but also to the mutual suitability of certain kinds of wooden construction and certain forms. This may have been the result of growing overall interest, during the second half of the nineteenth century, in the aesthetic content of certain constructions, as we mentioned above. Examples of this interest are the neo-vernacular projects by Stanislaw Witkiewicz, the founder of the "Zakopane Style" inspired by the peasant homes in the Tatra mountains [Fig. 41]. Among "neo-vernacularists" who were more influenced by the cottages of the Arts and Crafts Movement were, in Hungary, Karoly K6s, in Slovakia, Du?an Jurkovic, and in Poland, Witkiewicz's nephew and collaborator, Jan Koszczyc Witkiewicz. Their enormous influence on the construction of wooden country houses and villas in Central Europe is still felt today. Jan Koszczyc Witkiewicz insisted longer than anyone else that the "Zakopane Style" was the Polish national style, and he even transposed this style to masonry architecture. For him structural forms from carpentry constituted such important evidence of his convictions that he did not hesitate to make bold use of them with other materials, as in the kindergarten in Natqcz6w (1905). In the villas designed by Stanistaw Witkiewicz, form followed from construction [Fig. 41] - just as it did in the peasant architecture that inspired these villas [Fig. 30]. The reverse is true of his nephew's work [Fig. 45], which is sham carpentry since in fact its form is completely foreign to the actual stone and brick constructions. It is the symbolic representation of wooden architecture, in keeping with the artist's political and aesthetic principles, that meets the eye. Buildings in wood as they have come down to the present day have different functions and different contexts of form, and often quite distinct stylistic features. As we can see from the examples in the region near the Tatras, or in the large suburban areas of the United States, such constructions may even stretch densely over the countryside. The popularity of these buildings is due to varying, complex circumstances,71 and the inspiration, if any, for their forms lies in the more or less transient myths of modern-day mass culture. I would like to outline four questions in connection with my position on the issues discussed here: (1) the limits of technical determinism; (2) the relationship between wooden and masonry construction; (3) the semiotics of architecture in wood; (4) current criticism, history, and creativity. (1) What has been, and still is, most peculiar to architecture in wood is the great mutual dependence between, on the one hand, material and the technological possibilities available, and 42) Jan Koszczyc Witkiewicz, Potworowski House in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, 1910. Photo W. Wolny. on the other, form. This can be seen not so much from the vocabulary of forms and motifs, which were constantly changing according to current styles, as in the homogeneity of structures, with the construction sharply defining and tightly unifying space and volume. The general configuration of a structure with its geometric basis and proportions is the result of the special systematic character of wooden structures. This homogeneity dates back at least to the Iron Age, and in the lesser developed regions of Europe, lasted well into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in constructions deriving from preindustrial vernacular structures. The identification of construction with form began to break down when, in Baroque art, wood came to be used to produce illusionistic effects, and later, with the introduction of modern constructional engineering, for purely functional structures. 201</page><page sequence="26">43) Peasant house in Sul.cin Szlachecki, Poland, c. 1900. Photo J. twiderski. Here, however, as in the case of eighteenth-century synagogues, an extremely expressive and stylistically up- to-date kind of architecture managed to take shape in wooden constructions; it could not have been executed in any other material. By the early nineteenth century, the ancient requirement that utilitas, firmitas, and venustas be integrated was eroding, and buildings in wood began to be designed and appreciated for their suitability in relation to these categories on an individual basis. (2) Although in architecture the use of wood has always been contrasted to that of stone, and although throughout history this opposition has been of both a pragmatic and a conceptual nature, there have always been many connections of form and style between architecture in wood and in masonry. It is worth noting that in Atlantic Europe, the highly developed timber-framed structures which were popular there as of at least the thirteenth century, contributed to a particular system of architecture that was also adopted in stone and brick, differentiating it from the usual architecture in masonry. This system consisted of a set of thin, screen-like walls, the surface of which was meant to look flat and two-dimensional, as in half-timbered structures. This is especially obvious in Late Gothic and Mannerist secular architecture in England, Holland, and areas under their influence on the Atlantic and Baltic coasts. This system continued to be a tradition in vernacular housing well into the nineteenth century. Building in heavy stone was a Mediterranean solution imposed on the rest of Europe. Already by the late Middle Ages its influence could also be seen in wooden buildings in Central and Northern Europe, which followed masonry models in type, form, and in the semi-massive density of the log walls, in contrast to flat, timber-framed structures. In the Baroque period, when the process of substituting wood with stone and brick seems to have slowed down somewhat in these territories, architects also created buildings of high style in wood. Usually the models from masonry architecture were transformed rather than just copied, and timbers were not concealed behind illusionistic effects but were boldly exposed. In the overall system of the Baroque this architecture in wood was relegated to the "rustic style," which was the lowest category, and characterized by appropriate decorum, for example in the form of balustered columns. (3) Ascribing a term like "rustic style" to buildings designed by architects, means to speak of them through metaphor and symbol, at times reflecting the Neo-Stoic attitude to life of the person using the term. Neo-Stoicism was closely connected with the ancient myths regarding the origin of architecture. In Mediterranean culture these origins were sought in wood, not stone, buildings. In the Baroque culture of Northern and Eastern Europe, a wooden country house also came to be a symbolic expression of the owner's nationality or social position. With the advent of the Enlightenment, and later, of Romanticism, the relation of architecture in wood to national traditions and social concepts assumed a different character and served a different purpose, i.e., it tended towards a differentiation of expression within the framework of architecture parlante, and the assigning of historical, geographical, or even technological categories of form to ideological and ethical positions. In the second half of the nineteenth century in the countries 202</page><page sequence="27">44) Peasant house in Sopotnia, Poland, 1871. Photo C. Krassowski. of Central and Eastern Europe, wooden architecture, as a result of mistaken historical conceptions, came to be considered mere folklore, and moreover, began to acquire more radical political content, serving as a symbol of nationalistic ideals, or even populist mania. The symbolic expressiveness of these wooden structures became so strong that motifs specific to them were applied directly to the language of masonry architecture as well. (4) The syncretism and ideological chaos in art in the twentieth century have come to a head since 1950, opening up infinite points of contact between wood as a means of expression and contemporary culture and art, but at the same time weakening and undermining these concurrences. Furthermore, while wooden structures have been submerged in the semiotic panoply of architecture in the second half of the twentieth century, the almost unlimited technological possibilities now offered have in general led architects away from the previous valuation of both natural and synthetic materials for construction. In contemporary trends in the history of architecture, wood is at long last coming into its own. Examples are widely scattered and blend into the overall picture of today's environment. Changes have also come about in the interpretation of wooden buildings on the level of theory and criticism, particularly in the case of the semiotics of architecture so popular today, and in ways of viewing the evolution of high-style, vernacular, and primitive architecture, as well as their relationship to each other. In the Post-Modern world, the connections have been reestablished between history and creativity, and have influenced structures in wood, too, making possible, for example, Terry's Rustic Hut, which prompted the present study. 203</page><page sequence="28">.45) Jan Koszczyc Witkiewicz, kindergarten in Na ..cz6w, Poland, 1 . -Photo . -Woly. 45) Jan Koszczyc Witkiewicz, kindergarten in Na!qczow, Poland, 1905.

Recently Robert Venturi and John Rauch came back to this idea, whether consciously or not, as illustrated by their joke on the Ionic column made of oak in the Allen Museum of Art, Oberlin (1976). 6 These observations were made by E. Panofsky ("The Early History of Man in a Cycle of Paintings by Piero di Cosimo," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, I, 1937/38, pp. 12-30). A turning point in the development of civilization was supposed to be the passage from construction with tree trunks and branches to the use of squared timber, as Panofsky noted in "The First Page of Giorgio Vasari's Libro.

Malgorzata Szafrariska ("Ogr6d renesansowy," diss.
