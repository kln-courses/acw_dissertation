<plain_text><page sequence="1">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? A Debate Between Hegel and Heidegger on the Meaning of Ecological Thinking 1. Introduction One of the more lively, and unfortunately contentious, debates within the current environmental ethics literature is that between adherents of "deep ecology" and proponents of "social ecology." While the debate is many-faceted, perhaps the most central issue of contention focuses on the appropriate role of humanity in its relationship to nature. Deep ecologists argue for a "species egali tarianism" or "biocentric equality" that denies any special value or rights for human beings within the whole of nature: "all organ isms and entities in the ecosphere, as parts of the interrelated whole, are equal in intrinsic worth," as Bill Devall and George Sessions say. Or as the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess wrote in the 1973 essay where he coined the term "deep ecology," "there is a core democracy in the biosphere," such that "all things in the biosphere have an equal right to live and blossom and to reach their own individual forms of... self-realization."2 Social ecology, on the other hand, stresses the unique character of humanity within nature: human beings are not a "simple zoological phenomenon,... interchangeable with rodents or ants, ... merely one life-form among many," as Murray Bookchin, the anarchist ecologist who was most responsible for the development of "social ecology" in the early 1960s, puts it.3 In humanity, "blind nature" turns into "free nature," because only humanity is capable of creatively and self-consciously evolving, while nature can only adapt. Human beings are thus the highest expression of natural evolution, its coming into self-conscious direction of its own destiny.4 Copyright 1994 by Social Theory and Practice, Vol. 20, No. 3 (Fall 1994) 279</page><page sequence="2">280 Daniel Berthold-Bond For the deep ecologists, social ecology's anthropocentric perspective fosters the same patterns of human objectification, exploitation and subjugation of nature that have dominated the history of Western culture. As Hwa Yol Jung writes, the possibility for an "ecological Marxism" (the foundation for most social ecology) is undermined by the final "preoccup[ation] with the question of nature's instrumentality or the human significance of nature," but "the gain of... Humanity is the loss of Nature."5 For social ecologists, the "biocentric" commitment of deep ecology is dangerously misanthropic, seducing us towards an indifference to human beings: "terms like . . . 'biocentric democracy' go hand-in-hand-hand with a pious formula for human oppression [and] misery," Bookchin warns.6 One version of this debate has centered on the contrasting philosophical perspectives of Karl Marx, the original inspiration of contemporary social ecology, and Martin Heidegger, whose thinking has been the subject of a number of excellent studies by deep ecologists.7 In the present essay, I wish to re-center the focus of this debate somewhat by replacing Marx as Heidegger's partner in dialogue with the nineteenth century German idealist philosopher Hegel, the figure who himself so ambiguously preoccupied Marx. It should be noted that it is by no means clear that Hegel can be read as a social ecologist (although he clearly influenced Murray Bookchin in a number of ways), so that he is no straightforward "substitute" for Marx in the debate with deep ecology. On the other hand, I have recently argued that Hegel's thinking is nevertheless profoundly ecological,8 and since Heidegger himself views Hegel as presenting an equally humanistic and anthropocentric position as Marx, the ground of the debate—the contest between humanistic and anti-humanistic conceptions of ecological wisdom—remains in place. Moreover, Hegel is a particularly interesting choice for debate with Heidegger, since his "humanism" is not nearly as obvious as Marx's (a point Marx himself often made). One of the main purposes of this essay will be to show that Heidegger's uncompromising portrait of Hegel as the consummate humanist and anthropocentrist, paving the way for the earth-destroying nihilism of the technological age, is extremely problematic. When</page><page sequence="3">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 281 Hegel is released from the deceptive appearance he assumes in Heidegger's construction of him, we may see that his ecological thinking offers what is in many ways a more intriguing alternative to Heidegger's anti-humanism than Marx's directly humanistic position. Hegel is a humanist, but with a twist; a humanist who calls into question many of the same traditional assumptions of humanism as does Heidegger, a humanist who therefore requires that we rethink and redefine the very meaning of humanism. I wish to allow our debate on the possibility of a meaningfully humanistic ecology to take shape along the lines that Heidegger himself set out in his lifelong questioning of Hegel. Heidegger devoted a very considerable amount of thought, energy, and space to his engagement with Hegel9—much more so than he did with Marx—and the two most recurring strands of his critique center on the issue of the meaning of Being and the issue of what he called "subjectivism." What emerges is a picture of Hegel as initiating the closure of the history of Western metaphysics,1® perfecting the logic of that history, a logic swept up in a perilous "forgetfulness" and "oblivion" of Being (Seinsvergessenheit, Seinsverlassenheit) and absorbed in a veneration of the human subject as the center of the universe, reducing nature, the earth, and all its beings to mere objects for appropriation and control. In another essay,11 I have explored the first aspect of Heidegger's critique, that Hegelian philosophy culminates the metaphysical tradition's forgetfulness of Being. I argued that while Hegel undeniably displaces the "question of Being" from the central place Heidegger insists it must hold, in no way does he simply reduce Being to the atomistic and mechanistic relations of mere "beings" or "entities" or "things" that Heidegger sees as essential to the ideology of the modem technological age. What Hegel rejects is not Being, but the Seinsmystic (or "mysticism of Being") 2 that characterizes Heidegger's search for what he calls "Being in view of its difference from Existence [das Seiende]"13—Being as the "abyss" or Ab-grund, the groundless and nameless, something beyond or behind or under (but in any case fundamentally prior to) the environment or "world" of beings.14 Being is not forgotten by Hegel, but embraced within "spirit," as the environmental whole in which beings dwell, a</page><page sequence="4">282 Daniel Berthold-Bond position that allows for a genuinely ecological vision of nature, however different it may be in important respects from Heidegger's vision. The present essay will investigate the second aspect of Heidegger's critique, that Hegel gives definitive expression to the Western metaphysical tradition's institution of a "subjectivist" turn that entrenches the modem age in a radically un-ecological humanism.We shall first sketch out Heidegger's portrait of the foundational role of "subjectivism" in the metaphysical tradition, as well as the place he assigns to Hegel as decisively codifying this anthropocentric position and the tragic ecological consequences he sees as following from it. We shall then turn to look at a number of representative passages from Hegel's texts that seem to support Heidegger's claim. Our analysis will reveal, however, that Hegel's position is much less straightforward than it might seem at first glance. As we review several of the key issues at stake in Heidegger's critique of humanism—for example, the detachment of the observing subject from its "objects," the mode of "representational" thinking that reduces reality to a "standing reserve" or "stock" (das Bestand) for appropriation, the mechanistic and technological construction of science that underwrites the oblivion and desolation of nature, and the dualistic severing of humanity from its world—we shall see that so far from perfecting these values, Hegel had already initiated a searching questioning of them. Thus Hegel in many ways anticipates Heidegger in just the respects that Heidegger seeks to draw the lines of absolute difference. In our conclusion, we shall redraw the lines of difference between the values of Hegel's and Heidegger's ecological thinking, lines that still (as in Heidegger's own picture) distinguish between a "humanistic" and an anti-humanistic perspective, but lines that are much less well defined, much more ambiguous in their contours, than Heidegger's picture would lead us to expect. In effect, Hegelian philosophy represents a middle ground between the most sharply drawn antitheses within the debate between deep ecology and social ecology on the issue of humanism, and thus could serve to open a space for less contentious dialogue than often marks this debate.</page><page sequence="5">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 283 2. Heidegger's Concept of Humanism: "Subjectivism," Nihilism and the Technological Worldview Heidegger's thoughts on humanism became central to his writing with the "turn" (Kehre) in his thinking beginning already in the 1930s but not announced directly until his 1946 Letter on Human ism.151 shall not enter into the already overcrowded fray of debate over the chronology and meaning of this "turn," but simply note that whatever its vicissitudes and precise timing, at the very least Heidegger's Kehre describes a transition from his absorption in human being in Being and Time (1927) to his more explicit and focused concern with developing a language for approaching the meaning of Being itself in his later works. Indeed, the question of humanism is intimately entwined in Heidegger's thinking with the question of Being, or more precisely, with the forgetting of this question: In defining the humanity of man humanism not only does not ask about the relation of Being to the essence of man; because of its metaphysical origin humanism even impedes the question [of Being] by neither recognizing nor understanding it. Humanism is the essence of thinking that abandons Being to forgetfulness, leaving beings prey to human domination. It privileges the position of human consciousness over its "objects," the beings or entities it relates to and which come to have a value only insofar as they have a use for the subject. In "the modem metaphysics of subjectivity," all thinking, and even language itself, "surrenders itself to our mere willing and trafficking as an instrument of domination over beings." Humanity comes to be seen as the very "substance of beings, as the 'Subject' among them, so that as the tyrant of Being" humans may manage and control them, appropriating them as the raw material for the human will to power.17 According to Heidegger's view of the history of metaphysics, the early (pre-Socratic) Greek thinkers intuited an essential harmony of thought and Being, subject and world, the human and its environment. Thinking was not envisioned as the positioning of a "subject" set over against its "objects," but as giving itself over to the presence of Being, allowing itself to be "claimed" by</page><page sequence="6">284 Daniel Berthold-Bond 19 Being. Already with Plato and Aristotle, however, the lonr historical path of the human "insurrection" against Being and "fall" from Being began.20 Being was placed under the dominion of human thought, and a Promethean mood of the self-assertion of humanity over the world of beings inaugurated the history of metaphysics proper—the history, that is to say, of the abandonment and forgetfulness of Being and the consequent fall into an essentially nihilistic subjection of beings and the earth itself to the tyranny of the human Subject. The most decisive moment for the peculiarly modern expression of this humanistic and anthropocentric "dominance of the subject" occurred in the post-Greek "epoch" of the history of Being initiated by Descartes. In Descartes' philosophy and physics, nature is conceived of simply as res extensa, extended matter, that which is constantly available for use by the self-constituting ego, res cogitans.21 Essential to the Cartesian viewpoint—and all subsequent metaphysics—is a representational theory of meaning: beings have a value only insofar as they are represented (vor-gestellt) by consciousness, which thus stands over against them as their real meaning and truth. This representational thinking ushers in the age of technology, which is itself an "enframing" (das Ge-stell), a "setting-upon" (stellen) the world that allows beings to become present only as "mere things," everywhere "ordered to stand by, to be immediately on hand"; "nature becomes a gigantic gasoline station, an energy source for modem technology and industry."22 In this way, representationalism is directly humanism. To represent the world means that: [w]hat is, in its entirely, is now taken in such a way that it first is in being and only is in being to the extent that it is set up by man, who represents and sets forth (nur... sofem es durch den vorstellend-herstellenden Menschen gestellt ist).23</page><page sequence="7">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 285 3. Hegel as Humanist a. Heidegger's Hegel Hegel, for his part, is seen (I am tempted to say "represented"! but I get ahead of myself) by Heidegger as the representationalist and humanist par excellence. Thus Heidegger speaks of the "absolute subjectivity" and "absolute representing" of Hegel's metaphys ics. 4 The Cartesian "world picture" or Weltbild reaches its fullest fruition in Hegel's idealist system, where all reality becomes "spirit," which Heidegger understands as the apotheosis of the subject as encompassing and engulfing all reality, or as "absolute thought thinking itself." 5 Reality has lost any ground in Being, and is grounded and valued only through consciousness itself. Consciousness thus becomes the truth of all reality, and reaches its logical destiny in being represented as the divine. Hence Hegel's "ontology," or thinking on Being, is really not a "fundamental" ontology at all, since Being is reduced to "nothing," as the famous opening passage of his Logic (supposedly) seeks to demonstrate.26 No, Hegel's "ontology" is a disguised "theology" or "onto-theology," "a statement made by representational thinking about God."27 "Being" remains only as the projection of the human thinking Subject made Absolute, thought itself made godly, "being" reduced to the play of thought with itself. Hegelian idealism thus presides over the most complete forsaking and "emptying" of Being, which explains Heidegger's identification of Hegelianism as the harbinger of nihilism and the technological desolation of the earth. When Being becomes "nothing," and all things become merely representations of thought, we have lost our capacity for dwelling in the earth; we are radically homeless (Unheimische), and the world itself is radically "strange" (unheimlich) —de trop, as Sartre would say, a domain of mere things that must be mastered and brought under the power of human control through all the techniques of domination our scientists and technicians can devise.</page><page sequence="8">286 Daniel Berthold-Bond b. Damning Evidence? It takes no great detective work to find in Hegel's texts apparent support for Heidegger's reading of him as the ultimate subjectivist. The evident priority Hegel gives to thought is attested to in his description of history as "the history of thought finding itself' and of philosophy as a "movement in pure thoughts."29 Indeed, Hegel often speaks of reality as simply a projection, reflection, and production of thought: "the world [is] a world actually projected out of myself [aus mir herausgesetzen]"; "the existence of the world becomes for self-consciousness its own truth and presence; it is certain of experiencing only itself therein"; "self-conscious ness is aware that it is in itself the objectively real world"; and "the real nature of the object... is a product of my mind [das Erzeugnis meines Geistes] in its character of thinking subject—generated by me ... in my freedom."30 Moreover, what Heidegger sees as the "onto-theological" character of Hegelian metaphysics seems obvious in Hegel's repeated claims that history is "God's work" and that "God rules the world."31 However, if there is any suspicion that Heidegger is off the mark in his claim that this theology is really simply the most extreme rationalization and implementation of human divinity, it seems sufficient to cite passages where Hegel insists that "the divine nature is the same as the human" and that we 32 "behold our [own human] self in God." Thus "the realm of spirit consists in what is produced by man. One may have all sorts of ideas about the Kingdom of God; but it is always a realm of spirit to be realized and brought about in man." In line with this sentiment, Hegel commends Spinoza for concerning himself with God, but immediately adds that "with Spinoza there is too much God," since, presumably, Spinoza's divinity misleadingly stands for more than simply symbol or mirror of the divinity of humanity.34 Hegel's anthropocentrism is easy to find: the "ultimate purpose [of history] is . . . human freedom" and the realization of the "human will"; "If the life and the action of animals be divine, human action must stand much higher, and must be worthy to be called divine in an infinitely higher sense. The pre-eminence of</page><page sequence="9">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 287 35 human thought must forthwith be avowed." Similarly, in his aesthetics Hegel speaks of the "advance" from Oriental to Greek art as an advance to the embodiment of spirit "in the shape that is peculiarly appropriate" to it, namely the human form: "personification and anthropomorphism have often been maligned as a degradation of the spiritual, but... it must get involved in this anthropomorphism, since spirit appears sensuously in a satisfying way only in its [proper, human] body."36 Finally, to put an end to any remaining cavilling: The Greeks were anthropomorphic, their gods were humanly constituted; but the deficiency in them is that they were not anthropomorphic enough, . . . because man [was] not divine as man, but only as a far-away form and not as 'this', and subjective man. Such passages, which may be multiplied many times over, make it seem superfluous seriously to question Heidegger's portrait of Hegelian thinking or the logic that leads from this portrait to the conclusion that, as Michael Zimmerman puts it, "Hegel... paved the way for the culmination of subjectivism and, hence, of modem technology."38 4. And Yet! Rethinking Hegel's "Humanism" Heidegger liked to speak of the way in which every act of "bringing into presence" leaves as much concealed as it reveals: every revealing (Entbergung) is a concealing (Verbergung).39 Having now brought into the light of day some of the evidence for Hegel's subjectivism and humanism, I am convinced that we have only stepped into darkness: what is revealed leaves so much of Hegel's authentic thought concealed that we have only a "representation" in the most deceptive (Heideggerian) sense. The passages we have produced in every instance are torn out of context and suppress the ironic strategy with which Hegel then calls their apparent meanings into question. To fully deconstruct these meanings, however, would entail an enormous project of coming to terms with the subtleties of Hegel's "idealist" system, and we must content ourselves with a more modest approach, examining a few</page><page sequence="10">288 Daniel Berthold-Bond of the more central commitments of Hegel's notions of "subjec tivity," "idealism," and "representation," and their implications for ecological thinking. The result will not remove all trace of what Heidegger calls Hegel's "subjectivism": Hegel is a "subjectivist" and "humanist" in a sense, so that there are unquestionably impor tant issues of difference between these two thinkers. On the other hand, the differences are not as sharp as Heidegger represents them. Hegel's humanism is a genuinely ecological humanism, a construct Heidegger could only see as a contradiction in terms given his conviction of the intrinsically nihilistic implications of humanism. a. Hegel's Two Notions of "Subjectivity" The issue of Hegel's "subjectivism" is complicated by the presence of two contrasting thematizations of "subjectivity" throughout his writings: the first is the positive sense that underlies his famous claim that "everything turns on grasping and expressing the True, not only as Substance, but equally as Subject," while the second is a highly critical analysis of the "subjectivity of thought" that bears striking resemblance to Heidegger's critique of Hegel him self. Let us look first at Hegel's negative sense of subjectivity, before sketching out his positive alternative. Hegel sees what he calls "the principle of the subjectivity of thought," or "infinite subjectivity"41 as a recurring "mood" and "shape" in the history of the human spirit's effort to come to terms with its most fundamental project and source of its most fundamental anxiety: the reconciliation of thought and being, self and world, and spirit and nature, in face of the repeated experience of the "infinite pain" of their separation.42 We adopt this mood of subjectivity precisely in response to our sense of homelessness and alienation from the world. Through a withdrawal into the security of our own consciousness, we seek to challenge the reality of what lies outside us, reducing it through different strategies either to a mere projection of our own thought or to an "alien" reality we seek to "consume" or "annihilate." Hegel's critique of this shape of spirit can best be seen in his exploration of how it has been expressed historically or "made concrete" in a number of</page><page sequence="11">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 289 philosophies ranging from Socrates to the Stoics and Skeptics up to many of the modem philosophical systems from Descartes to Kant to Fichte and the Romantics. Socratic subjectivism, for example, culminates in the stance of irony,43 a state of mind and way of being that "cannot renounce [its] isolation and withdrawal into [itjself or tear [itjself free from this unsatisfied abstract inwardness." "If the ego remains at this standpoint," Hegel says in extending his commentary on irony to such Romantic authors as Friedrich von Schlegel, Karl Solger, and Ludwig Tieck, then "everything appears to it as null and vain, except its own subjectivity which therefore becomes hollow and empty and itself mere vanity." The intrinsically ironic nature of subjectivity directly parallels Heidegger's analysis of the inherent nihilism of subjectivism: irony is an attitude of "absolute infinite negativity," Hegel says, which seeks to demonstrate "the nullity of everything objective" and culminates in the effort to "annihilate" or "destroy" the world that stands over against the autonomy of the self-enclosed subject.44 Hegel applies his analysis of the ironic essence of subjectivity to the standpoint of radical skepticism as well, which asserts "the subjectivity of all knowledge" and "universally substitutes] for Being the expression appearance," a characterization revealing for its closeness to Heidegger's notion of the oblivion of Being. "In skepticism we now find that reason has got so far that all... of Being . . . has disappeared. . . . The abyss of the self consciousness of pure thought has swallowed up everything."45 Skepticism is finally the "dizziness" of the "annihilation][of] the being of the world," and thus "belongs to the decay both of philosophy and of the world."46 If the skeptic adopts a straightforwardly ironic and annihilating stance towards the world of being, the nihilism of the stoic's subjectivity most perfectly captures the Heideggerian sense of active "forgetting." The stoic does not directly seek to destroy the world but to put it out of mind, to achieve the peace of a "lifeless indifference," of a "pure movement of thinking . . . remaining] simply and solely in communion with [itjself." 7 Hegel's radical indictment of the poverty of this narcissism of "pure self-thinking thought" should give us pause when we see Heidegger ascribing</page><page sequence="12">290 Daniel Berthold-Bond the very same attitude to Hegel, as though Hegel were unwittingly adopting just the principle of subjectivity that he so strenuously sought to expose as the ultimately "embarrassing" philosophy: "stoicism, therefore, was embarrassed [ist darum in Verlegenheit gekommen] when it was asked ... for a content of thought," for its only "content" is just its own thinking itself, utterly detached and withdrawn from the world.48 Hegel's highly critical interpretation of subjectivism is central to his reading of modern philosophy as well, in a way which anticipates many of Heidegger's most trenchant criticisms. Descartes is described as "transplanting" philosophy "into the sphere of subjectivity," privileging the "immediate certainty of thought" and the "inward conviction" of the "I" over against the world of beings that in turn becomes consigned to the explanatory framework of a "pure mechanism." The Kantian philosophy is also grounded in the "principle [of] subjectivism" or the "subjectivity of thought." For Kant, the world of beings "is in itself falling to pieces, and only gets objective coherence and support, . . . even actuality . . ., through the good offices of human self consciousness and intellect." The world is thus constituted by 49 "man's own perspective and projection," precisely Heidegger's and the deep ecologists' description of humanism. It should be added that just as Heidegger speaks of the Western philosophical tradition—"right down to Kant and Hegel," as J.L. Mehta remarks50—reducing human reason to a tool (Werkzeug) for excavating Being,51 Hegel in fact seeks to dissociate himself from what he also sees as the Kantian conception of "cognition [as] the instrument [Werkzeug]" for "getting hold of... being."52 Finally, in Fichte and such Romantics as Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Novalis, and Schelling, modem philosophy remains equally far from the task of "getfting] beyond the subjectivity of the ego." In these writers there is an "infinite activity" on the part of the subject of seeking "to abrogate the non-ego," or whatever stands opposed to consciousness itself, "and to bring forth itself " as the center and truth of all reality.53 Hegel's portrait of subjectivism is one of nihilism, vanity, and narcissism, the "reflection [of the self] into the empty 'I,' the vanity of its own knowing," an attitude of superiority over</page><page sequence="13">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 291 whatever is "other" to it which justifies for the self every effort to "refute" and "destroy" the other's independence.54 It is an attitude that actually borders on disease in Hegel's view. Indeed, Hegel defines insanity (Verriicktheit) in terms of extreme subjectivism: "in this diseased frame of mind [the self] will not give up [its] subjectivity, [and] is unable to overcome [its] repugnance to the actual world." Insanity is a "fixation" on, or "engrossment" and "imprisonment" in the self, where the "purely subjective world is quite as real as the objective world," indeed more so, since reality is now straightforwardly a projection of the subjective mind, a "shadow cast by the mind's own light."55 Hegel's positive sense of the "subjectivity" of spirit is adamantly opposed to the values and the whole mood of this finally diseased subjectivism. It takes as its most fundamental gesture a movement outwards from the self-enclosed self, from the hollow and self-consuming "motionless tautology" of "I am I," from the "sanctuary" of thought absorbed in its own majesty and the "pleasure" of its destructive relation towards all that lies outside it.56 The "home" of the true subject is not within the sanctuary of its own self, but in its environment: "the depth [of spirit] is to be measured by the greatness of the craving with which spirit seeks to find itself in what lies outside of itself."57 The authentic self constantly reaches out beyond the limits of the "I" to the standpoint of the "T that is 'We' and 'We' that is 'I',"58 just as deep ecology speaks of the ideal of "self-in-Self," or individual existing within a whole,59 and Heidegger seeks to shift the being of consciousness outwards, into the "Da" or "there" or environmental setting of Da-sein ("being-there" or existence). "Subjectivity" in its positive sense is for Hegel precisely this process of reaching outwards (sich Ent-aiijierung), of self-discovery within the environment or "whole" that constitutes the truth of spirit. The value of the whole is paramount in Hegel's metaphysics, and contrasts with every dualistic attempt to posit an essential separation between self and other, or subject and object: "the true is the whole"; "truth is only possible as a universe or totality"; "separated, detached things have no [authentic] actuality; the power which forces them apart [from other things] cannot prevent them from at once entering again into a process [of</page><page sequence="14">292 Daniel Berthold-Bond interrelation], for they are only [fully real] in this relation"; and "subject and object,... each is only relatively necessary; the one exists only for the other."60 Thus Hegel's idealism, which calls us to embrace the unity of subject and object, or self and world, is emphatically not an attempt to simply reduce "objectivity" to "being-for consciousness," or to grant us the ultimately destructive license of what Hegel refers to as the "principle of utility," that "the tiling in itself is nothing, but has meaning only in relation to the T.'" It is a characteristic of "false" or "spurious" or "empty" idealism to assert a unity of thought and Being that only exists within consciousness itself, with the reality of the external environment reduced to a figment of the imagination.62 Such a view transfigures the world into a mere "shadow," a "lifeless mist," an ephemeral, perpetually "vanishing" reality, prepared finally to be "rent asunder," "consumed," and consigned to the "rage and fury of destruction."63 Hegel's idealism, on the contrary, seeks a unity of thought and being that is a genuine unity of inner and outer, self and world, subject and substance, within the environmental whole of spirit in which all beings dwell. b. The Status of Representation and Mechanistic Thought Hegel's two very different notions of "subjectivity" suggest that we should rethink Heidegger's depiction of Hegel as a "subjec tivist" thinker, given how closely Hegel's own sustained critique of subjectivism resembles Heidegger's. This suggestion becomes even more plausible when we consider that Hegel also largely anticipates Heidegger's association of subjectivism with repre sentational thinking (Vorstellungsdenken), which we have seen Heidegger to link with the "enframing" essence of technology (das Gestell), and thus to the ecological destruction or "setting upon" (stellen) the world that marks our age. Hegel no less than Heidegger calls for a radically new way of thinking: the "real import" of things is "for the first time put in its proper light" only when we "transform" the images or pictures (Vorstellungen) we form of them by a new way of "think[ing] things over" (Nachdenken).65 Nachdenken literally means</page><page sequence="15">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 293 "thinking after," or "after-thinking," and implies that we do not first of all constitute the object in thought (as in representation), but think it "after," or in response to, its own presentation. Hegelian Nachdenken is thus of a spirit with Heidegger's notion of essential philosophical thinking as Andenken, or remembrance,66 especially when we see that Hegel associates Nachdenken with Erinnerung, recollection.67 We must learn to think in this new way, precisely because our most habitual way of thinking, "picture-thinking" or Vorstellungsdenken, obscures the "inner" nature of beings lying "behind the surface" created by our images. We must learn, then, "to become acquainted with [our thought] in a new way, quite opposite to that in which we know [it] already."68 To truly "think things over" thus "denie[s] [us] the use of [our] familiar representations [gelaufigen Vorstellung]," so that the mind "feels the ground where it once stood firm and at home taken away from beneath it, and ... cannot tell where in the world it is [weiB es nicht, wo es in der Welt ist]."69 This sentence is striking for its similarity to Heidegger's questioning of the familiar, "average everyday" understanding of things, and his anatomy of the fundamentally disorienting, and uncanny character of the movement to authentic thought. Hegel's project is precisely to disorient and dislocate the "tyrannical" Subject Heidegger speaks of from its complacent domination of the world so that we might once again find ourselves at home in the world. In fact, Hegel goes at least as far as Heidegger's uncovering of connections between the essentially destructive, nihilistic trinity of Vorstellen, Gestell, and stellen in his own association of Vorstellen with Verstellung, a fundamental dissemblance that is equally a shifting or misplacing or displacing of the world (verstellen): representational thinking "sets up" (aufstellt) or "posits" (setzt) a world that is really an act of dissemblance ( Verstellung), since the place (Stellung) of this world is radically displaced (versetzt, verstellt) into a mere representation (Vorstellung) of consciousness.71 No wonder, then, that Hegel's challenge to representational thinking will result in its not knowing "where in the world it is," for its world (its representation) is nowhere to be found when we move beyond representation to the "thinking study of things."72</page><page sequence="16">294 Daniel Berthold-Bond Hegel speaks of representational thinking as a sort of "apprehension" (Auffassung) of things that is very close to Heidegger's description of representation as an "enframing" and "setting upon" things. To apprehend things is to "hold them fast" (festhalten) in our representation of them. Like Heidegger, Hegel also implies an inherent violence to this act: "to confine [the thing] to a pure apprehension," consciousness "has only to take it" (es hat ihn nur zu nehmen). Representational thinking "degrades" the being of things into "something therefore that is dead and cannot be [authentically] known."73 In this way, Hegel's critique of representational thinking is directly linked to his often repeated critique of mechanism, 4 which itself so closely resembles Heidegger's critique of technological thinking. Mechanistic science is a directly representational world view that leads to the objectification, dispersion, and deadening of nature ("we murder to dissect," as Wordsworth, Hegel's contemporary, put it):75 nature is "split into fragments, into parts which are isolated and detached from each other, devoid of any necessary connection." In this way of seeing, "the rustle of nature's life is silenced;... her abundant life, wearing a thousand wonderful and delightful shapes, shrivels into arid forms."76 Hegel's notion of authentic "thinking things over" or "thoughtful study," as opposed to "apprehension" and "representation," entails that we let go of our urge to "take" things and "hold things fast," and that we give ourselves over to "the coming-to-be of the object" or the object's self-presentation.77 Genuine thinking "demands surrender to the life of the object,"78 a point that is very close to Heidegger's notion of learning to experience the "self-presencing" of beings. This idea can also be seen in Hegel's rethinking of the nature of the language appropriate for a non-mechanistic relation to the world. It is well known that Heidegger sought to develop a non-representational, "poetic" language that might allow the Being of beings to come into presence without at the same time bringing beings under the dominion of a technological and objectifying mode of expression. But however unique Heidegger's highly provocative "way to language" is in many respects, it is often very close to the values and insights of the linguistic turn Hegel undertook a century</page><page sequence="17">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 295 before. Hegel's often-quoted "wish to try to teach philosophy to speak German"79 already implied an attempt to find "a new grammar" by which representational thinking could be overcome, a project that largely foreshadows Heidegger's emphasis, even as early as Being and Time, on the secondary or "derivative" nature of ordinary propositions and assertions.8 Hegel's advocacy of a fundamentally new approach to language is exemplified in his proposal of the "speculative" or "philosophical proposition" that would replace—or more strongly, "destroy"—the familiar subject-predicate prepositional form. Like Leibniz, Hegel surmised an important parallelism between the grammatical subject-predicate relation and the ontology of the self, or the existential subject, as related to its "objects." That is, the way we speak, right down to the syntax of our sentences, inherently reflects certain ontological assumptions. But unlike Leibniz, Hegel challenged the usual conception of the relation between the subject and its predicates, which he felt seduced us into thinking of subjects as somehow "containing" or "fixing" their predicates, or as predicates as the "properties" of the subject (implying a sort of ownership), and directly associated this conception with das vorstellende Denken, which seeks to "enframe" its objects, to use Heidegger's expression. So too, the ontological subject, the self, does not "contain" or "fix" or hold as its "property" the world by thinking it. In the philosophical proposition, predicates "recoil" back against the subject, casting it into question: the subject "suffers, as we might put it, a counterthrust [GegenstoJJt]," such that it is displaced. Hegel is searching for what he calls a more "plastic" expression of language that might "destroy" the subject-centered pretensions of ordinary language and thought.82 This is no doubt a difficult idea, and would require much work to draw out its full implications, but at the very least it is clear that Hegel is challenging both the model of grammar and the model of ontology that assume the priority of the "subject" over against its "objects," where the subject is the "firm objective basis" (festen gegenstandlichen Boden) upon which the meaning of the proposition and the meaning of the world transparently rests.84 Just as we have seen Hegel to say that the ground (Boden) of</page><page sequence="18">296 Daniel Berthold-Bond representational thinking is "taken away from beneath it" by a more thoughtful study of things, the very ground of familiar language is unsettled by truly philosophical speech. Thus, notwithstanding Heidegger's reading of Hegel as consummating the "subjectivist" history of metaphysics, this new mode of speech clearly insists upon a radical reconception of the traditional place of the "subject." 5. Redrawing the Lines of Difference Between Hegel and Heidegger This radical displacement of the traditional role of the subject, through an impassioned critique of all representationalist-mecha nistic-egoistic constructions of subjectivism, makes it very diffi cult to accept Heidegger's painting of Hegel with the brush of traditional Western humanism. But does this mean that Hegel is actually a closet anti-humanist? Only in a sense. Hegel opposes the same nihilistic humanism Heidegger does, and yet the human subject remains fundamental in his metaphysics of spirit. True, spirit is conceived in a thoroughly holistic way: spirit is not the "ego" or "I," nor is it simply the human or the social, but embraces the whole of being, very much including nature. This is Hegel's inheritance from the Romantics, one he never gave up even in his attempts to move away from Romanticism in many other respects. But there is no doubt that for Hegel it is the human aspect of spirit that is primary: it is only in human thought and action, in the expressions of human culture, that nature, the environment, and the world itself come into light in a meaningful way. Nature may be, as Hegel insists, the very "presupposition" of spirit and forever intimately conjoined with spirit,85 but the human spirit is nature's highest evolution, and only within the development of human culture can the world of beings have meaning. This evolutionary reading of spirit is opposed by Heidegger, and by some deep ecologists, although other deep ecologists have come to question Heidegger's anti-evolutionist history in a way that actually brings them much closer to Hegel: "Because deep ecology maintains that humanity is actualizing its</page><page sequence="19">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 297 potential," Michael Zimmerman contends, "and because it adheres to its own version of a progressive, evolutionary view of history, deep ecology parts company with Heidegger, who rejected such views and maintained instead that Western history is the story of humanity's degeneration." Zimmerman, it must be said, is quick to add that while "Hegel's thought is the most important example" of an evolutionary interpretation of history, deep ecology must resist his "anthropocentrism and his domineering attitude toward nature,"86 a picture of Hegel I have been seeking to throw into question. Hegel's "humanism" may be seen in his theory of language, which he defines as the very existence or "being-there" of spirit: "We see language as the existence of spirit [das Dasein des Geistes]."87 Since Hegel regards language in its fullest sense as a uniquely human capacity, he is committed to privileging the place of humanity in bringing forth the world of spirit into full "actuality" (Wirklichkeit) or significance. It is in this sense that Hegel's idealist dictums should be read: when he speaks of the world as a "projection" of thought, or as thought as the very meaning and truth of actuality, he is hardly denying the actual existence of the world prior to thought, nor is he denying the significance of what lies outside of thought, but he is denying that this significance can emerge independently of the work of conceptualization in human social, scientific, artistic, religious, and philosophic projects. Such commitments bring Hegel close to many of the values of the social ecologists, and correspondingly more distant from some of the values of deep ecology, at least in its most anti-humanistic (and occasionally self-avowedly "misanthropic"88) versions. The early Heidegger, the Heidegger prior to the "turn" of the late 1930s, was actually very close to these Hegelian "humanistic" ideas. In Being and Time, he too spoke of human Dasein as the precondition for any "clearing" in which beings could manifest themselves, of human language as the unique "space" in which this clearing occurs, and therefore of humanity as the very possibility for establishing or founding a world.89 Even as late as 1953, in his Introduction to Metaphysics (a reworking of a lecture given at the University of Freiburg in 1935), he says that "world</page><page sequence="20">298 Daniel Berthold-Bond is always world of the spirit," and that "the animal [and presumably the rest of nature as well] has no world [Welt] nor any environment [Umwelt],"9® implying the privileged place of humanity in founding, or "opening-up," or giving meaning to a world. But more typical of Heidegger's later works is an extreme anti-humanism and anti-subjectivism that sees the world, or environment, as constituted by "the things themselves." As Michael Zimmerman says, "In his earlier writings,... Heidegger suggested that human Dasein constituted the clearing in which things could be manifest; later, he said that... things do not appear ... because we disclose them; instead, things call forth a world in which they can reveal themselves."91 In this later view, Heidegger develops a radically non-subjectivist view of language: while language still remains essential to the "clearing" in which meaning is revealed, it is no longer strictly speaking humans who speak, but language itself: Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.... For, strictly, it is language that speaks. Man first §oeaks when, and only when, he responds to language by listening to its appeal. As Charles Taylor puts it, for the later Heidegger it is "a deeply erroneous view" to see language "as our [human] power, some thing we exercise," and the "disclosure [brought about by language as something] we bring about."93 The "language" that discloses prior to human speech, "language" as the "house of Being which comes to pass from Being" itself rather than from the voice of humanity, is deeply connected to Heidegger's Seinsmystik, his mysticism of Being, his notion of Being "calling" to us from out of itself. And it is this mystical element of Heidegger's anti-hu manism that Hegel could not accept: there is no voice of Being, nor any self-constitution of a world, prior to human language. On the other hand, Hegel's "humanism" cannot so easily be lumped together with the humanism Heidegger speaks of as bringing about the decay of language, "the widely and rapidly spreading devastation of language," the inevitable "fall" of language "under the dominance of the modem metaphysics of</page><page sequence="21">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 299 95 subjectivity." We have seen that Hegel too associates the representationalistic language of "subjectivity" with Verstellung or dissemblance, and calls for a fundamentally new way of speaking in which the subject is decentered from its place of domination, a way of speaking which will enable us to hear again "the rustle of nature's abundant life." Moreover, what lies behind Hegel's critique of the language of dissemblance is precisely what Heidegger is seeking, a more holistic conception of spirit than can be found in "modem subjectivism" and humanism, a conception that consistently opposes any radical dualism of nature and spirit. As early as his Difference essay of 1801, Hegel spoke out against the view of nature as a "lifeless, infinite antithesis" to human consciousness, as something basically "dead," the "dead shell of objectivity," the "atomistic lifelessness" to which nature is reduced by mechanistic physics. In this mechanistic and dualistic world view, human reason becomes "nothing but the dead and death-dealing rule" over nature.96 What has been lost here is the spiritual essence of nature, and any concern for the world.97 The world of nature has been reduced by this mechanistic understanding to the principle of utility: "everything is useful; everything is at the mercy of everything else." Such is the inevitable logic of this principle that not only nature, but human beings themselves eventually become regarded as "things" or "useful instruments"—"just as everything is useful to man, so man is useful too, and his vocation is to make himself a member of the group, of use for the common good and serviceable to all." 8 Hegel's words here directly anticipate Heidegger's analysis of the double degradation of humanity and the world through the "utilitarian" ethos of "the They." Thus Heidegger follows Hegel step for step in speaking of how, "as soon as [everything] . . . concerns man . . . exclusively as standing-reserve, and man ... is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve, then ... he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve." Hegel elaborates on this theme in a passage from his lectures on Aesthetics where he is speaking of a certain way of relating to nature as a collection of "particular things"—really, a</page><page sequence="22">300 Daniel Berthold-Bond Heideggerian "standing reserve" or "stock"—at the mercy of the human desire for consumption: In this appetitive relation to the external world, man... does not open his mind to [things],... [but instead] maintains himself in them by using and consuming them, and by sacrificing them [to] his own self-satisfaction.... Neither can desire let the object persist in its freedom, for its impulse drives it to cancel this independence and freedom of external things, and to show that they are only there to be destroyed and consumed. But at the same time the person too, caught up in ... his [all-consuming] desire, is neither free in himself. This critique is virtually identical to Heidegger's critique of the modern technological age, and shows that notwithstanding his closeness to some of the thinking of social ecology, Hegel's thought is equally sympathetic to much of the spirit of deep ecology. Hegel shares with Heidegger and deep ecology a profound sense of the need to recover nature as a "home," or environment, through a concerned way of being in which the world is no longer reduced to a collection of useful things to be sacrificed to our desires but allowed to "persist in its freedom." Hegel even comes close to Heidegger's notion of learning to "dwell in the fourfold" {das Geviert) of earth and sky, gods and mortals—one of the key ideas picked up from Heidegger within deep ecology101 —in which we learn to live in harmony with nature, "saving the earth" by "setting it free" from our consumerist exploitation.102 Not only does Hegel, like Heidegger, portray the modern world as given over to "the cruel words that 'God is dead'1,103—and in the same sense as does Heidegger (emphatically not in the name of some "transcendentalist" "onto-theological" project!),104 namely, that we can no longer experience a sense of the "holy," the sacred unity of thought and being, or humanity and nature —and not only does he seek a way to reinvest the world with this sense of the sacred; but more, in at least one place he actually foreshadows Heidegger's elemental notion of "earth and sky." In a passage from the Phenomenology where he is exploring an essential parallelism or mirroring of the "organization of moments" of nature and spirit, Hegel writes: In the same way that nature displays itself in the universal elements of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth: Air is the enduring... element; Water, the element that is perpetually sacrificed; Fire, the unity which energizes them into opposition</page><page sequence="23">Can There Be a "Humanistic" Ecology? 301 while at the same time it perpetually resolves the opposition; lastly, Earth, which is the firm and solid knot of this articulated whole, die subject of these elements and of their process, that from which they start and to which they return; so in the same way, the inner essence ... [of] Spirit... displays itself as a world. Heidegger also describes the earth as the "ground" of beings, that domain of Being itself that shelters and preserves, supports and nourishes beings, from which they emerge and in which they dwell—that which makes possible the display of the world. That Hegel's words about the earth are couched within an analogy to spirit points to the sense in which he remains a "humanist": it is spirit in its human shape that ultimately displays the world and is the "subject" that unifies the whole. But that he also refers to earth as the "subject" —Hegel's emphasis—suggests that the human subject is not itself to be set over against nature as the "dead shell of objectivity," as a mere stock of material to be consumed. Human spirit is only one facet of the whole of spirit—albeit its center, its "peculiarly appropriate shape," in Hegel's view, given his belief that only human language and art can "create a world"106— but the earth is itself "subject," a living and organic environment. Truth is the whole, which exists only in the achieved unification of consciousness and world, humanity and nature. We must "heal ... the wounds of the spirit"107 created by the tearing apart of these two dimensions of being by a diseased form of subjectivity. We must "give ear to [the] urgency" of the spirit "which lives in us all," and heed the "summons" of spirit to bring it out of its "lifeless seclusion" or concealment "into the light of day."108 These words are kindred words to those of Heidegger when he speaks of learning to hear the call of Being, of "paying heed" to the danger in which we find ourselves in our technological age, and of our being "summoned to hope" by "the saving power" of a new way of being and dwelling that might allow us to bring beings into presence in a truly "poetic" way.109 When we see through the misleading association of Hegel with a fundamentally un-ecological humanism and subjectivism that he himself sought so strenuously to challenge, we may find a genuinely ecological "poetry" in his own "humanistic" account of spirit. It will remain an account that leaves plenty of room for debate with Heidegger's anti-humanistic ecology, for the role of humanity is still conceived</page><page sequence="24">302 Daniel Berthold-Bond in significantly different ways, but it will become a debate marked by a shared sense of urgency for a new and fundamentally ecological sensibility towards our dwelling in the world.

Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973), p. 95. With Nietzsche, the nihilism implicit in the course of Western metaphysics becomes explicit. Hegel, however, is the last great spokesperson for the dream of a positive metaphysics. Hence "the completion of metaphysics begins with Hegel's metaphysics" {End of Philosophy, p. 89); the "incipient end" of metaphysics assumes "in Hegel . . . great and definitive form" {An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans.

The argument is that Being (Sein) taken as prior to all individuation or specifi cation in "determinate being" (Heidegger's Seienden) is really only "a blank...featurelessness," an "empty word" and "inchoate thought" that in itself "is nothing" (Hegel's Logic, sections 85,86 Zusatz, 87 Zusatz4, Science of Logic, p. 78). I discuss this aigument in "What is Called Ecological Thinking?" and seek to show that Hegel's purpose, as well as the conclusion he draws about the nature of Being, is very different from Heidegger's reading of it as implicit nihilism. It is only a certain way of defining Being—and by no means Being itself—that Hegel sees as suffering this collapse into "nothing."

See also Westphal's Hegel's Epistemological Realism (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer, 1989), and my review in The Review of Metaphysics 45 (1991): 157-58. 65. Hegel's Logic, sections 1, 3, 5. 66.

Hegel, Phenomenology, pp. 492-93. It should be noted that this comparison becomes complicated considering Heidegger's attempt to distinguish his own method of "remembrance" as a "step-back" (der Schritt zuriick) from Hegel's notion of "recollection" as a "cancelling" and "raising up" (Aufhe bung) (see Identity and Difference, pp. 42-43). On the other hand, I agree with Joseph Flay, against John Caputo, that the difference between these two methods is not nearly as great as Heidegger makes it out to be.

Taylor's comments pick up on the sentiment of Edward Abbey, often cited by deep ecologists, that he would sooner shoot a man than a snake (Desert Solitaire (New York: Ballantine Books, 1968), p. 20). Needless to say, many deep ecologists deny any implication of misanthropy in their biocentric thinking. 89. For example, Heidegger says that "the foundation" for the "truth" of the world is the "being-in-the-world" of human Dasein (Being and Time, pp. 219,226,297). 90.
