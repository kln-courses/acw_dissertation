Cazzella) The analysis of prehistoric anthropomorphic figurines often swings between the extremes of arbitrary explaining and mere describ- ing. Perhaps we can now try narrow more and more the span of interpretation analysing contextual data and specific features and using ethnographic comparison as source of hypotheses. The ancient roman dolls (by M. Manson) In this article are exposed the method applied to the analysis of Roman dolls.

Recupero) The author makes a relation about the doll's representation in the works of art. There are many dolls represented in the picture among XVI and XVII century, with some exception in the art of north-Europe more inclined to represent the daily life. The dolls appears more frequently in the picture of eighteenth century and further more in nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The author gives us some suggestion to go deep into the doll in the history of art. The ambiguous and true-resemblance. Toy-dolls, kings' images, costume figures (by E. Silvestrini) The dolls, as industrial products or nearly industrial, in western European society, can be divided in two categories: the toy-doll, caratterized from the ambiguous relationship between young mother and child, which can be used as play-object to realize childhood's creativity, the dolls as models represent, on the con- trary different social figures. The portrait-dolls are raffiguration of personalities, while the costume-figures represent the social con- tex of folclore and tradiction. The two standardized aspects of contemporary doll (by C. Rocchi) The author makes an analysis about cultural patterns imposed from consuming societies in the images of dolls as Barbie and the cabbage patch. This patterns are to much homogeneus in rela- tion to the doll's function in traditional culture. The doll in the last two centuries narrative (by D. Scafoglio) In this article the doll is considered through the suggestive ima- ges in literature of nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The author specifies three significant aspects in the doll. The doll as object of children's desire, becomes a worrying element, in its inaminate nature in Hoffman's tale of man's of sand. As a representation of man's figure the doll is an expression of sensation to be closed in a cage. The doll, after all, can become an object of delight in the vital metamorphosis in Hans Bllmer works'. The doll's soul (by L. Ruberti) In this article are developed literary and psychoanalytic questions. The author analized an essay of Rilke about the doll, with some references to Freud's theory, where the doll is considered in its deep simbolic sense. The doll is considered, in the same time, as the origin, in childhood, of a feeling of anxiety. The doll, the mirror, the serpent's slough (by A. Milillo) The doll appears in folktales, in different functions. It is a play- object and, in the same time, the double: the personification of the main character of the tale. Moreover, the doll appears in all the magic-tales, which generally represent the initiatoty rites. The doll in what remain of the transition from a situation to another. Dolls, perfumes, sin in the immaginary of italian song (by L. M. Lombardi Satriani) The doll is considered in the reality of italian melodic song, in 166</page><page sequence="2">which woman is represented as dispencer of sin, unless she doesn't help the rank of mother and wife. The image of the artificial woman doll is concerned in the context of the italian culture and mentality of middle class in the years between 1930 and 1960, with some literary references. Emotional thought and objects (by A. Lombardozzi) After having individualized some questions of epistemology relative to the conception about the function of play, the author considers the doll's use inside children's play and its psychoanalitical interpretations, with more attention to Win- nicott's idea of transitional object. The doll in ethnological societies: play-object or substitute? (by E. Cerulli) In ethnological societies the doll has, mainly a magical-votive func- tions and sometimes can considered as a substitute-simulacre. In the kind of societies according to the author, we can't think the doll as a play-object. The doll in some societies represents a substitute of not-born child or of a defunct. In other context, in- stead, the doll absolves the function to bring fertility. The 'waka' buried. Simbolic burial of a woody Image of Central Coast of Perul (by C. Cavatrunci) This short article deals of burial, as substitute of the dead, of wood figure in the central coast of Peri. In a funerary envelope, arriv- ed in Italy to be shown in TV, there was, instead of the dead, a woody anthropomorphous idol. This figure are very common in the archeology of Pert and they consist of different matter as wood, terracotta, cloth, stone or metal and they are 'wada' because of the connection with the rite and divinity. They always belong to the funerary equipement, but they never substitute the place of the dead. So, this particular burial seems to be consacrated to the figure itself, that is 'waka' as protagonist of rite and burial in the same time. Other world lovers: iconographic translation and social effects of supernatural presence among Baule in Ivory Coast (by E. Cossa) This paper concern the social implications associated to a very particular art production of the Ivory Coast Baule. In Baule opinion every human being has an &lt;&lt;other world lover&gt;&gt; who, if neglected, may affect his real partner with serious sexual problems. To solve this kind of sicknesses it's necessary to carve the other world lover and to concede to him/her one night a week more uxorio. Though the wooden portrait of one's other world lover is still carv- ed following traditional aesthetical models, it now shows formal innovations connected with the new social strains and expecta- tions experimented by Baule people and due to the increasing western fashions. Recent diffusionof ornamental dolls in Ivory coast (by G. Parodi da Passano) In these last years, among the Lagoon patrons of Akye and neighboring people, a fairly good success assists a particular ex- pressive medium, to be exhibited in the &lt;salons&gt;: the colorful wooden statuary representing female nudes. Part of the present large production of ivorian commercial art, these ornamental realistic style-made &lt;ladies&gt; represent an ambivalent reality, by incorporating foreign imagery in a tradictional structure, evolv- ing in consequence of fading and reintegration of values of the tribal universe. Blending of standard western advertising and erotic patterns with african meanings and usages the feminine body display becomes an evidence of the introduction, on the immagina- tion level, to the &lt;&lt;modernit&gt;, without excluding the permanen- cy of local aesthetic needs. Simbolic figures in folk-ritual of Bulgaria (by T. Boneva) The author describes the use of the doll as a magical and pro- piziatory object in the folk rituals of Bulgaria. This custom is very important during nuptial rites. In occasion of some festivity, in springtime, the girls that are going to mariage, partecipate, at the presence of all comunity, to a rite in which they use some dolls to have fertility in the future.

Simeoni) On the bases of the research work carried out in Rome and in Montepulciano (Siena), it is documented, in the period from 1930 to our days, the use to put, on the double-bed, a doll with a large dress of cloth or paper. It is a present that the mother in law gives to the daughter in law and, in old age, it was a wish of fertility. The doll is a simbol of the child and the bride, joint in the same figure and represent the totality of the woman, and it is a sup- port of identity. Eadible dolls (by O. Cavalcanti) The author describes the custom, in Calabria and in other places, to prepare and eat traditional cakes in ritual context. In country societies, the ritual use of bread and cakes has mainly a propitiator and regenerator function. During some festivity occasion as Christmas, New year's day, Eastern, the ritual preparation of cakes allows the transformation of natural elements in cultural elements. Some observations about tart-pictures in a calabrian peasant village (by F. Faeta) This article deals with tart-pictures that people make in Soriano, near Catanzaro, in central Calabria. These are manufactures with flour and honey by pastri-masters in a great variety of shapes; people use them as ex voto, gift, feast-sign. The author describes the perform modalities, the use, the disap- pearence of these images, introducing, with a critical approach that recovers some indication of structuralist method in an historical-cultural perspective, to an analysis of modern folk- imagination among the lower classes of a region in Southern Italy. Living figures: one cultural pattern in theatre, ritual, religion and play (by A. Pasqualino) The author makes a suggestive analysis of cultural patterns relative 167</page><page sequence="3">to the figure as puppets, masks, dolls and religious icons.

The pieces exposed represent different social and cultural context. We can distinguish this figures in three important groups according to their function. We have, in fact, ritual figures, toy- dolls and costume figures. Fiorano, from the sanctuary of the madonna to the sanctuary of tiles (by L Dignatici) Since 1965 the village of Fiorano in the province of Modena has been the centre of a considerable influx of immigrants coming mainly from the South of Italy. This is due to the great expan- sion which has taken place in the ceramic industry. In the culture of the immigrants there is a characteristic interweaving of tradi- tion and transformation, of acceptance and rejection of the tra- ditional cultural heritage. 168</page></plain_text>
