(Gerard Genette, Figures).l In a perceptive article, Silvio Jeschua discusses the way in which Valery disguises the true subject of L'Idee fixe behind the multi- plicity of themes which it purports to treat, leaving the reader the task of deciphering the essential one for himself. This is the suffer- ing caused by love, the " ide fixe " from which the author is seeking desperately to free himself throughout the dialogue, but which he refuses at every turn to put into words.2 One could develop Yeschua's thesis further by saying that the central theme of the work is the gap between the spoken and the unspoken. Traditionally the theatre, and its derivative, the dra- matic dialogue, has been the literary form most given to the direct expounding and presentation of thought and emotion. Here, how- ever, its role is reversed, and the imaginary stage of L'Idee fixe is used as a shield to protect a world of feeling which is not spoken, and remains veiled in silence. The meaning of the dialogue lies in the area which its words conceal, not in what they overtly express. Its dazzling verbal displays, arabesques and pirouettes are 1 Editions du Seuil, 1966, Vol. I, p. 242. a See " Autour de L'Idee fixe (R6flexions sur la forme de l'informe) ", Europe, July 1971, pp. 69-81.</page><page sequence="2">M L N 645 merely a screen for their complete opposite: a refusal to speak at all. This silence, and what it represents in terms of intensely felt, contained emotion, is the constant low, bass theme underlying the treble of the animated verbal play between the two actors in the drama, Valery and the doctor. It brings with it a reversal of all the other meanings which we might be tempted to attribute to their conversation. What at first appears to be a witty, light-hearted, at times somewhat frivolous exchange of repartee is in fact a way of deliberately evading serious and even tragic issues. Similarly, what appears to be a disconnected series of comments on an infinite variety of topics is in fact one long, protracted, and finally fruitless attempt to flee from the one grave subject which is never explicitly discussed, but whose hidden presence can be felt throughout. This difference between the apparent and the real is symbolised by the contrast continually suggested between the idyllic summer day by the sea which serves as a backdrop to the conversation and Val6ry's inner gloom. There is more than a hint of these paradoxes in the introduction, which critics have tended to overlook in their interpretation of the dialogue itself. Even here, foreshadowing the tone of what is to follow, Valery speaks in oblique language, using the most general and abstract terms, which are still, however, explicit enough for the alert reader to grasp his message. He is tormented and obsessed -as Valery was in real life at the time 3-by constantly recurring thoughts, feelings and images associated with an unhappy love- affair, whose complexity is defined with masterly precision in the first paragraph: "J'etais en proie a de grands tourments; quelques pensees tres actives et tres aigues me gataient tout le reste de l'esprit et du monde. Rien ne pouvait me distraire de mon mal que je n'y revinsse plus 6perdument. Il s'y ajoutait l'amertume et l'humili- ation de me sentir vaincu par des choses mentales, c'est-i-dire, faites pour l'oubli. L'espece de douleur qui a une pensee pour une cause apparente entretient cette pensee meme; et par la, s'engendre, s'eternise, se renforce elle-meme. Davantage: elle se perfectionne en quelque maniere; se fait toujours plus subtile, plus habile, plus puissante, plus inventive, plus inattaquable. 8See the Cahiers, C.N.R.S., Paris, 1957-1961, Vol. XV, p. 295 and sqq. The Vol. XV, p. 295 passage was written in 1931, and the dialogue was first published in 1932.</page><page sequence="3">646 M L N Une pensee qui torture un homme 6chappe aux conditions de la pens6e; devient un autre, un parasite."4 Having defined this principal theme, Valery goes on to introduce two of his subsidiary themes. The first is his search for escape from his emotional preoccupations through intellectual activity (which is precisely what he is going to do throughout the dialogue): "Je me traitai l'intellect et le corps en tyran, avec violence et incon- stance. Je leur donnai des exercices difficiles: c'dtait faire en petit ce que fait l'humanit6 par ses recherches et ses speculations: elle approfondit pour ne pas voir." 5 Since this technique seems to be producing little effect, he turns to another possible solution: movement, which is also presented as an attempt at escape. Finding that "la marche simple et plane" 6 leaves him too much freedom to reflect, he goes down to the sea and tries to distract himself by the physically demanding activity of jumping from rock to rock: " C'est pourquoi, descendu furieusement vers la c6te, qui dtait de roches ecroulees de toutes grosseurs et des figures les plus diverses, je m'imposai le travail tres penible d'avancer dans le ddsordre parfait de leurs formes de rupture et de leurs bizarres dquilibres. C'dtait contraindre l'dtonnante machine humaine i produire a chaque instant une action toute nouvelle et particu- litre, qui exigeait d'elle la presence entiere de ses moyens de provision, d'adaptation, et de ses forces les plus differentes." 7 This incessant physical movement should be seen as an extended metaphor for the mental and verbal movement of the dialogue itself, which also demands of " l'tonnante machine humaine " the same agility, foresight, spontaneous adaptation and marshalling of forces. The metaphor is carried over into the sentence that follows: "Tandis que je m'engageais aux bonds, aux escalades, et t toutes les difficultes d'un terrain rigoureusement irregulier, tout herisse d'obstacles et rompu de petits abimes toujours imprevus, toutefois je me sentais surveillant en moi le point noir d'oui renaitrait au moindre rdpit la crise des convulsions interieures, des hypotheses 'L'dde fixe, Gallimard, Paris, 1934, p. 13. All subsequent references are to this edition. 5 pp. 14-15. p. 15. p. 18.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 647 et des reactions insupportables." The parallel structure "Tandis que je m'engageais" and "toutefois je me sentais" underlines the latent tension in the dialogue between the figurative "leaps" of the two intellectual gymnasts from subject to subject and word to word, and the presence, only just below the surface, of Valery's anguish, as chaotic and disturbing as the leaps are controlled and reassuring. The expression "rompu de petits abimes toujours im- pr6vus" (recalling the earlier reference to the "bizarres 6quili- bres" of the rocks) reminds us of the precarious balance of the whole exercise, and the "depths" into which Valery is in danger of "falling" if he once "loses his footing." From beginning to end, the dialogue is to involve exactly the same studied effort to maintain the most delicate balance, and to avoid, by pulling up short or leaping off in another direction, the "petits abimes" between the rocks where the dark regions of suffering lie. This unremitting vigilance on Valery's part, and the doctor's discretion in respecting it, give added meaning to the comment in the preface of the second edition: "ce ne sont que les 'premiers termes' de ce qu'ils pourraient peut-etre dire qu'ils disent." 8 In other words, the lack of depth in the dialogue is deliberate. To probe any idea too far would not only mean slowing down the rhythm of a sophisti- cated intellectual game "dont la vitesse," as Valery says, "est l'essentiel " 9: it would also run the risk of touching some sensitive and vulnerable area. However, it is precisely this lack of depth concealing depth which makes the dialogue such a subtle expression of the unspoken, and which therefore leaves so much to the reader's imagination. This characteristic places it firmly-despite its obvious link with the tradition of the eighteenth century dialogue, particuarly as treated by Diderot-in the style of the contemporary theatre, which is essentially a theatre of silence. There is much in L'Idee fixe that is very close to the words hiding reality rather than revealing it, or else pointing to a reality beyond themselves, which characterise the plays of Beckett, Ionesco or Pinter. Once one has read the introduction as closely as it deserves, one is alerted to the metaphorical significance of the very first theme raised in the dialogue: the theme of simulation and dissimulation. When Valery asks the doctor what he is doing-is he painting or 8p. 10. p. 10.</page><page sequence="5">648 M L N fishing, or both?-he replies: " Rien du tout . J'ai la de quoi peindre. Et de quoi pecher. Mais le poisson ni le paysage n'ont pas grand'chose a craindre. Ils me sont des pretextes . . Je simule, mon cherI En vacances, tout le monde simule." 10 He is pretending, like Valery, in order to cure his disease (" Mais encore faut-il que je trompe mon mal"), which he defines as " le mal de l'activit6," 11 the incessant neurotic movement of body and mind to which he, like Valery and everyone else in the modern world, including the great discoverers in the field of science and technology, is subject. Ideas take on for them all an obsessive quality: " Que je le veuille ou non, a chaque instant, une idee, une remarque, une analogie, me devient une presence exigeante,-une sorte d'epine mentale . .."12 Here we have a further interesting illustration of the way in which many of the themes in the dialogue which bear on Valery's hidden " mal" are raised by the doctor as applying either to himself or to the whole of humanity. In this case, his reference to his " opine mentale " is a direct verbal echo of Valery's " atroce insecte " whose "ardente pointe," he says in compelling language, "entre- tenait dans la chair de mon esprit une brulure indivisible de mon existence." 13 What are the symptoms of this pathological obsessiveness, the doctor asks. First of all, frantic, nervous movement, like Valery's (" Je voudrais bien savoir ce que vous faisiez dans les rochers, a sauter, i monter, g descendre? . . .").14 And secondly, the tendency for ideas not so much to remain "fixed " as to depart from our mental norm of perpetual transition, transformation and change by con- tinually recurring (" tout en provoque le retour") .15 When the regular pattern of change, and the freedom which accompanies it, are disrupted, the unfamiliar duration of the obsessive thought produces a result which becomes its hallmark: pain. ". . . Toute pensee qui dure un peu plus qu'il ne faut, se fait sentir .. . Sentir,- comme un ecart. Un ecart a quoi? Elle se fait p6nible,-sensa- tion." 16 The theme of suffering leads directly to the first mention of the forbidden subject of love, to which the dialogue frequently returns in passing, but on which neither speaker ever allows it to dwell. For if one did dwell on it, Valery remarks, " on en mourrait," just 10 p. 21. 1 p. 22. 12 p. 25. 18p. 16. 14 p. 28. 1Sp. 31. lop. 34.</page><page sequence="6">M L N 649 as in the act of love itself the climax, if it lasted more than a fleeting second, would turn into pain (" Quoi de plus pros d'une douleur . . .") .17 So Valery rapidly shies away from the subject, taking refuge in a witticism ("La cause de la depopulation est claire: c'est la presence d'esprit. [. . .] II faut perdre la tete ou perdre sa race ") .1 But before long he finds himself questioning again the mysterious nature of "cette sensation .. caracteristique, fulgurante, terminale [. . .], cet instant suraigu, cet acumen [. . .], cette catastrophe enfin [. . .], cet instant supreme." 19 This time, it is the doctor's turn to do Valery's debunking for him, just as the devil does in Mon Faust: " Ceci n'est pas positivement neuf, mon amil "20 Then off the two speakers fly on a new tangent, as happens time and time again through the dialogue, into another " safer" subject, the faults of history, which in turn leads on to questions of cosmo- logy and anthropomorphism. But it is only a few minutes before the "idee fixe " theme returns. Valery attempts to define its ever- present insistence by the term "omnivalent," which the doctor immediately parodies. When Valery reproaches him with his flip- pancy, he suddenly reverts to a more serious tone, introducing another important secondary theme of the dialogue: the contrast between surface and depth, which runs exactly parallel to the contrast between words and silence: "-[ . .] Je vais vous dire: il fait superbe; on cause; et je ne sais rien de plus delicat ni de plus delectable que de se jouer, comme nous faisons, a la surface de... -De quoi? -De tout. De nos esprits. De nos problemes... -De nos soucis, de nos peines . . . De notre histoire." 21 This affords a natural transition to the subject of how difficult it is to plumb one's own depths. The fashionable subconscious, Valery maintains, reveals only "des profondeurs accessibles," but below these lie "des profondeurs insondables." How true, replies the doctor: there are some things that one can say to others, other things that one can say only to onself, and other things still " qu'on ne peut meme pas se dire a soi-meme." 22 This reference to what Valery calls "la vie des visceres" brings us right back to the main 17p. 35. 18 p. 36. 19 pp. 37-38. 20 p. 38. 21 p. 46. 22 p. 48.</page><page sequence="7">650 M L N theme, which the doctor abruptly declares is forbidden territory: "Halte. Defense d'entrer. Danger de mort . . . Restons a la sur- face..." 23 But the conversation, through its own spontaneous ebb and flow, soon returns to the impenetrability of our " visceral " life, whose tyrannical domination of the intellect, Valery says, causes us so much suffering. It should be noted with what art this subject is introduced as the most natural one for a man to discuss with a doctor: it recurs several times later, always giving deeper emotional undertones to the abstract references to the life of the body or the primitive state of the biological sciences. As an example of this mystery, Valery quotes his intensely physiological reaction to a " lettre . . . foudroyante "24 which he once received. He does not even allude to its contents, but the reader can guess at them, and a reference in the Cahiers in fact shows that the letter was sent to him by the woman he loved in the twenties at a crucial-and pain- ful-turning-point in his relationship with her. The thought is once again too disturbing to be dwelt upon, and Valery diverts the conversation into modern atomic physics (where the statement "Plus on descend dans la petitesse, moins on corn- prend" nevertheless has a double ring),25 and from there into the world of children, play and entertainment, followed by-of all unexpected figures-Napoleon, and then, in equally rapid succession, physiology, the mind as an unusual thermodynamic machine, and dreaming (" C'est 1," Valery remarks, "que je vois toute la puis- sance de la profondeur . . . viscerale se jouer de la surface intel- lectuelle ") .26 No sooner has the theme returned than it is gone again, replaced by a discussion of crime, and then of mental con- fusion (more common, says Valery, "quand on est plusieurs," as in conversations and . . . "duos d'amour ") .27 This glancing reference to the thorn concealed in Valhry's flesh leads him to " change the subject" by introducing the topic of the vagaries of conversation. The whole exchange which follows is full of symbolic meaning and thematic allusions. The doctor speaks first: "-C'est de la detente ... II fait bon et superbe, ic. Nos propos font des ronds a la surface de nos ennuis. -Le mal de l'activit6 s'y apaise. aa p. 49. 24 p. 52. as p. 55. 26 p. 66. " p. 73.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 651 -Oui. Si l'on se taisait un peu? -Une minute de silence? ... Garel ... Si l'on se taisait, ce qui parle a present dans l'air parlerait dans . . 'homme ...

He reflects on the contrast between the calm of the beach and the sea on this summer afternoon and the crazy agitation of his normal life in Paris (thus obliquely alluding to the idea that for him, as for Valery, their conversation is a brief " holiday" from care). Then on it moves relentlessly from the simplicity of the mental processes of animals through the nature of life and death (with a brief echo of the refrain: "L'intelligence ne comprend rien a la vie ")29 to the mystery of the birth of thought. This leads to a flippant piece of verbal by-play-clearly a defensive reaction on Valery's part-on the strange view which gynaecologists must have of love, followed immediately by a swing back to the complex potential of the mind, which Valery christens " l'implexe," and then on to his favorite topic, the imperfection of language. Here the doctor interrupts him, saying that he finds him hyper- tense, and poses him a series of elementary diagnostic questions on how well he is sleeping and eating. He then moves cautiously into a more probing question: "-Et . . . le reste? -Vous etes bien curieux. -Le reste est silence? -Je vous repbte que vous etes trop curieux." 30 This evasiveness prompts the doctor into sketching out the rudi- ments of a " diagnosis " of Valery, which he fills out in richer detail at the end of the dialogue: "-Allons, vous etes ronge, mon ami ... -I y a du vrai. 28 pp. 73-74. 2 p. 79. 80 p. 95.</page><page sequence="9">652 M L N -Vous etes... mordu. C'est evident. -Mais l'acuite et l'agilit6 de l'esprit, ce sont mes remedes.

Dans trois ans, me disais-je encore, ces memes fantomes n'auront plus de force." 34 The painful subject is yet again evaded, and the conversation moves on to the biological and medical sciences, to an Arabian fairy tale about two rival magicians, to the doctor's experience of stand- ing for the municipal elections, to the concept of the universe, to the " automisation " of modern life, to insanity, mental creativity, the theory of relativity, modern science, and finally back to the constant theme of the inscrutability of life. At this point there is another sudden deepening of tone. The physical world in which the dialogue has been taking place is brought forward to the centre of the stage as Valery comments that night is about to fall. In a lyrical passage, he evokes the light from the sunset falling in showers on to his eyes: 1 p. 96. 8 p. 98. 8 p. 101. 8 p. 14.</page><page sequence="10">M L N 653 "-J'ai les yeux tout eblouis par ce feu, et hantus d'un bleu-vert superbe. -C'est une bonne r6ponse r6tinienne. -C'est un peu comme . . . une idWe fixe. -Vous voyez bienI ... -Je vois vert, en attendant. -Fermez-les. -Plus je les ferme, plus je vois . . . Vert, cramoisi; bleu tendre, rose .. -Toute la lyre ..."35 The doctor's down-to-earth replies cannot distract either Valery or the reader from this upsurge of intense feeling, in which the eyes " haunted " by a mysterious and magnificent universe of colour and the "idde fixe" rising from the depths of the self are intimately fused. The poetry as well as the obsession of love for a moment completely dominates the scene. From this point on, we become conscious of a great warmth that has developed between the doctor and his "patient "-a warmth beautifully suggested in the outstanding stage production of the dialogue by Pierre Fresnay and Julien Bertheau.36 As the darkness begins to close around them, Valery says quietly: "-Mon bon docteur, je vous ai dit bien des btises... -Bah . . . -C'est que j'en ai le plus grand besoin." 37 To Valery's unusually direct admission of his emotional vulner- ability-a moment of necessary release of tension-the doctor re- sponds iwth characteristic discretion: "-Ohi Je vois bien qu'il y a quelque chose qui ne va pas. Mais je ne vous demande rien." He reveals, however, by his next remarks that all this time he has been looking at him with a doctor's trained eye-in fact, as his terminology indicates, with the eye of a psychiatrist: 88 [. . .] Vous etes plein de defenses . .. virtuelles. [. . .] Le physique et le moral, chez vous, se tiennent . . .On peut le dire. I1 n'y a qu'A 86p. 156. 86 At the Theatre de la Michodiere in 1966. 87 p. 157. 8 It is most significant that the doctor represented in the dialogue is a psychiatrist, Dr Bour, whom Valery knew well. The setting of the dialogue by the sea alludes to the vacations which he spent about this time with Dr Bour and his wife at Agay, in the South of France.</page><page sequence="11">654 M L N vous voir. [. . .] Un visage nerveux ravag . . ."9 He now feels free to expand and complete his earlier partial "diagnosis," and does so with great perspicacity (which is, of course, Valery's own, ironically turned in upon himself): " [. . .] Je vous vois tout garni de clochettes . . . nerveuses. Un souffle, un rien, vous fait sonner toute une musique de reactions et d'idees. [ ...] Et vous r6agissez contre ces reactions par une mdthode tout a fait singuliere . . . [. .] Vous reagissez, vous vous d6fendez par un recours aux abstractions, vous abusez de precisions et de definitions. L'attention intellectuelle vous sert d'isoloir . . ." 40 He then reveals that all the time Valery has been speaking he has been aware as well of the emotional origin of many of his appar- ently general and impersonal statements: " [. . .] Je me dis, dans mon petit coin de cerveau, que vous travaillez pro domo. II y a des theories qui ont l'air abstraites et qui vous projettent tout vif un monsieur sur l'ecran. [. ..] Donc, quant a vous, il me suffit de vous voir parler, d'entendre votre timbre et vos attaques de voix. La facon de parler en dit plus que ce que l'on dit . ." 4 (a maxim which admirably summarises the whole dialogue). Valdry now admits that he had originally come down to the rocks to escape the torment of his own thoughts, and by his fresh refer- ences to the mental discipline involved in leaping from one to the other, he completes the closed cycle of the conversation, bringing the reader back again to the point he had made in the introduction just before it began. Meanwhile, darkness has almost completely fallen, and with it all the mysterious, frightening underworld of the mind has returned (" Docteur, filons . . . On n'y voit presque plus ") .42 The two men go off together linked by a strange new bond of friendship, all the stronger because it remains only half expressed: "Vous etes bien aimable," says Valery, "de m'avoir supporte si longtemps. Cet apres-midi me paraissait... difficile ... i vivre. Grace t vous . . ." 43 The presence throughout their long conversation of Valery's pregnant silence and the doctor's equally silent understanding of it has completely changed their relationship. This man whom at the beginning Valery had tried to avoid to be alone has now become his essential human companion, and we realise in retrospect the significance of the doctor's earlier reply to "9 pp. 157-158. 4"p. 159. ,lpp. 160-161. 2 p. 163. 18p. 163.</page><page sequence="12">M L N 655 Valery's comment that he needs to act out the solitary part of an intellectual Robinson Crusoe: "-Bien, Monsieur Robinson . Et comme nous sommes ici sur une sorte d'ile, je vous suis une sorte de Vendredi." 44 We can thus see that this apparently formless work is in fact a masterpiece of subtle structure in which every detail counts. We can see too that though it describes a kind of circle, it comes back to its starting-point, like En attendant Godot, changed and enriched by the journey. But over and above this aesthetic response which it evokes in the reader, it leads him to reflect on a much broader issue, hinted at in the doctor's "diagnosis ": one of the important purposes of language of which psychologists and psychiatrists are becoming in- creasingly aware. This is its role as a defence mechanism, a smoke- screen, a method of evasion and rationalisation which the emotion- ally disturbed or distressed person uses to protect himself from the pain of self-revelation to others, or-perhaps even worse in his eyes-of self-discovery. For most such people the ways in which they use words and the reasons for which they do so remain largely subconscious, but in this dialogue Val6ry achieves the artistic and intellectual tour-de-force of consciously manipulating them to dis- play his awareness of how they operate on the subliminal level, even in his own case. He does the same with his use of silence. Over the last fifty or so years, psychiatrists have been probing more and more deeply into the relationship between a person's silences and his most profound feelings, and discovering that in a conversation-for example be- tween a psychoanalyst and his patient-what is not said, the questions which are not answered, the points which are not taken up, that is, the areas where language is avoided, are usually far more important than those where language is actually used. To probe these areas the doctor, like the one in Valery's dialogue, requires clues, and these are provided both by the patient's silences themselves and by his introduction of new subjects of discussion, side-issues and other conversational "red herrings" at the points where he, like Valkry in L'Idee fixe, fears that the privacy of his inner world of tension, suffering and conflict is in danger of being invaded and laid bare. 44p. 85.</page><page sequence="13">656 M L N And so this seemingly innocuous dialogue turns out to raise one of the most significant-and disturbing-of subjects: the extent to which we all use words, and silences, to say what we do not feel, and to avoid saying what we do. Valery here shows his affinity with all those contemporary linguists and critics who, in analysing our statements, whether spoken or written, seek out the deep structures, and allow as much for the "non-dit" as for the " dit."
