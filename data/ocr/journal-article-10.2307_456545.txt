In 1894, while preparing my doctor's thesis at Yale Uni- versity, on the subject, "The Elizabethan Drama, especially in its Relations to the Italians of the Renaissance," I began to study the Italian sources of the English dramatic poetry of the age of Elizabeth. Many of the plays are dramatized versions of novelle, which, in translation, were so popular at that time. But I soon found that romantic fiction by no means exhausted the treasure-trove of Renaissance literature upon which the great dramatists drew so largely, both for their matter and their inspiration. Italian discovery, history, science, manners, music, all that Italy had so abundantly contributed to the general stock of intellectual wealth, was becoming more and more familiar to the eager, open, im- pressionable minds of Elizabethan Englishmen, and almost everything of importance that appeared in France and Spain was sooner or later pressed into the service of English genius. So I purposely set aside the main subject of my inquiry, the Italian sources of Elizabethan plays, until I had made a collection, as complete as possible, of all the translations from the Italian during the Elizabethan period, understanding by that, the entire cycle of the great drama, approximately from the accession of Edward VI. to the Restoration, from 1549 to 1660. With this paper, Part IV, I now complete the bibliography. Part I, comprising 70 numbers, on "Romances in Prose," will be found in the Publications of the Modern 2 465</page><page sequence="2">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. Language Association, Vol. x, No. 2, June, 1895; Part II, 82 numbers on "Poetry, Plays, and Metrical Romances," Ibid., Vol. xi, No. 4, December, 1896; and Part III, 111 titles on 'Miscellaneous Translations,' Ibid.,Vol. xiII, No. 1, January, 1898. The present paper, an account of 139 trans- lations, is the second half of Part III, and as that dealt with religion and theology, science and the arts, grammars and dictionaries, and proverbs, so this instalment of Miscellanea treats of voyages and discovery, history and politics, manners and morals, and Italian and Latin publications in England. The whole bibliography, corrected to date, consists of 411 translations, representing a total of 219 English translators, and 223 Italian authors. The two hundred and nineteen Englishmen include, directly or indirectly, every considerable writer of the period. Bacon is not here, but his friend, Sir Toby Matthew, the most 'Italianated' Englishman of his time, translates the Moral Essays into Italian, and dedicates them to Cosmo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, eulogizing his lifelong friend for "having all the thoughts of that large heart of his set upon adorning the age in which he lives, and benefitting as far as possible the whole human race." Shakspere is not here, but Shak- spere is the soul of the romantic drama, and the English romantic drama not only went to Italian literature for its subjects, but it borrowed from the Italian drama much of its machinery, the chorus, the echo, the play within the play, the dumb show, the ghosts of great men as Prologue, appa- ratus in general, and physical horrors ad terroremn. The stories of fourteen Shaksperean dramas are found in Italian fiction, and several other plays contain suggestions from it. Tlhe list of Italian authors includes practically every notable Italian writer of the Renaissance, on all sorts of subjects. Of the foreign influences that shaped Elizabethan literature, unquestionably the Italian was the greatest. In discovery and commerce, Columbus was merely the last of a long line of Italian navigators, who, in the service of the western nations, 466</page><page sequence="3">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 467 sailed into distant and unknown seas. In history, transla- tions of the great vernacular Italian historians, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Cardinal Bentivoglio, prepared the way for our English Hall, Grafton, Stow, and Holinshed. In poli- tics, Sir Thomas Smith, the Earl of Monmouth, and James Howell, follow in the footsteps of Malvezzi, Father Paul, Botero, and Paruta. Philosophy, through the intrepid spirit of Bruno, cast off forever the shackles of scholasticism to enter upon its inheritance from antiquity, and it was the England of Elizabeth that permitted Bruno to speak. The Italian astronomers reveal the secrets of the skies, and Milton, travelling in Italy, seeks out and visits, at Arcetri, the greatest of them, "the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought." Teofilo Folengo, Trajano Boccalini, Paolo Giovio, and Poggio-Brac- ciolini, helped at least to make known to the more sombre English the sunny smile of humor and the rapier thrust of wit. In manners, the Italians of the 16th century had all Europe for their pupils. Della Casa's Galateo is a graceful and intelligent guide to good manners to this day, and II Cortigiano is a classic, the best book on manners that has ever been written. It was the fashion for young Englishmen of family to finish their education by the tour to Italy, and many of the translators are these 'Italianated' travellers, Crashaw, Daniel, Greene, Drummond, Gascoigne, Howell, and Milton. In the Courtyer, a knowledge of music is said to be neces- sary for the well-bred gentleman, and Venice, which was the Paris of that time, was the most musical city in Italy. So we find the Elizabethan lutanists and madrigalists both travellers and imitators of Italian musicians. John Dowland, in the Epistle prefixed to his First Book of Songs or Airs, refers with pride to the encouragement he had received from Luca Marenzio and Giovanni Croce. Thomas Oliphant, in La Musa Madrigalesca, accuses Thomas Morley of barefaced</page><page sequence="4">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. plagiarisms from the madrigali of Felice Anerio and the ballate of Gastoldi. In the preface to Part II. I suggested that a study of the relation between the Elizabethan lutanists and Italian madrigal writers might throw considerable light on the lyrical quality of Elizabethan dramatic poetry. For some one who knows both historical music and the Italian poetry of the Renaissance, I feel sure that there is something of value to be learned from John Dowland, John Wilbye, best of English madrigalists, John Ward, John Hilton, Thomas Weelkes, organist successively of Winchester College and of Chichester Cathedral, and from other Elizabethan composers. Nor was all the travel in one direction. Bruno, Vanini, Vermigli, Ochino, and Michelangelo Florio found refuge in Protestant England. Other Italians came over as teachers of various arts. Vincentio Saviolo taught fencing and suggested the immortal Touchstone. Charles I. employed Orazio de' Gentileschi (Orazio Lomi) and his daughter, Artemisia, both painters, to decorate his palace at Greenwich. Girolamo Cardano visited Edward VI. in a medical capacity, and left an account of his impressions of the young king which is extremely favorable, and all the more valuable because it comes from a competent and disinterested observer. It is really wonderful how familiarly Italian and things Italian were known in England in Elizabeth's time. I question whether any foreign vogue, before or since, ever took such hold upon English society. Pietro Bizarri, the historian, said of Queen Elizabeth, "she is a perfect mistress of our Italian tongue," and we read how in her last illness the great Queen turned wearily away from matters of state to listen with charm to the Hundred Merry Tales. The Portuguese ambassador habitually corresponded with Sir Francis Walsingham in Italian, and among the State Papers of the period Italian letters are not at all uncommon. We see here Cecil issuing political papers in Italian, as well as in English and Latin. 468</page><page sequence="5">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 469 My next paper will essay to bring together the Elizabethan dramas that are Italian in source, or scene, or direct sugges- tion. The whole cycle of the drama, within the limits of this bibliography, consists, roughly speaking, and including all sorts of representations, of' upwards of 1500 plays, masques, pageants, and shows. Of these about one-half have survived. My studies of these surviving 700 or so plays show nearly 300 that hark back to Italy. If imitative plays, or plays of remote suggestion be included, the number of 'Italianated' dramas would be still greater. For example, Mr. Courthope, in his History of English Poetry, argues ably, and, to my mind, conclusively, that Marlowe produced his great plays under the spell of Machiavelli. Peele also wrote under the Italian spell. Perhaps some one some day may find the names of Marlowe and Peele among the English students of the University of Padua. Elze says that students repre- senting twenty-three different nations thronged to Padua towards the close of the 16th century, and that not a few Englishmen were among them. I have many friends to thank for encouragement and suggestions during the progress of this work. They will appreciate with me a thought from that most charming of books, Anatole France's Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard,- "I opened a book which I began to read with interest, for it was a catalogue of manuscripts. I do not know any read- ing more easy, more fascinating, more delightful, than that of a catalogue." a. VOYAGES AND DISCOVERY. 1555.

The Chevalier Francisco Antonio Pigafetta, of Vicenza, "for to see the marvels of the ocean," accompanied Ferdinand Magellan [Fernao de Magalhaes] in his circumnavigation of the globe, from September, 1519 to September, 1522.

It is more than likely that Shakspere had read Pigafetta's journal in Eden's History of Trauayle, for he takes from it the name of Caliban's god, Setebos [Tempest, i. 2. and v. 1]. While the ships were wintering at Port St. Julian, Patagonia, 1520, Magellan captured two of the Patagonians " by deceyte by loading them with presents and then causing shackels of iren to be put on theyr legges, makynge signes that he wold also giue them those chaynes; but they begunne to doubte, and when at last they sawe how they were deceaued they rored lyke bulles and cryed uppon theyr greate deuyll Setebos to helpe them." 1577.

The Zeno family was one of the most distinguished in Venice, furnishing during the 13th and 14th centuries a doge, several senators and members of the Council of Ten, and military commanders of ability and renown. The adventures of the two Zeni in the North Atlantic are related in six letters, two from Nicolo Zeno, known as "the Chevalier," to his brother, Antonio, a third, presumably addressed to some other member of the family, and three letters written by Antonio, after he had joined Nicolo, to a third brother, Carlo, called, for his success in the war against Genoa, "the Lion of St. Mark." The voyages were made 474</page><page sequence="11">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 475 about 1390-1405, and the narrative was first published in 1558, by Nicolb Zeno, the younger, a member of the Council of Ten, and great-great-great-grandson of Antonio. In brief, the letters relate how Nicol6, the Chevalier, sail- ing from Venice around to the North of Europe, was caught in a storm and wrecked on one of the Faeroe islands. About to be murdered by the natives, he was rescued by a great chieftain, who, recognizing the rank and nautical skill of the stranger, gave him a post of authority in the national fleet. This chieftain has been identified as Henry Sinclair, Earl of the Orkneys, and Caithness. Nicolo persuaded Antonio to join himn, and together they undertook various expeditions, one of which carried them a long distance to an island in the western ocean. The name of this island suggests Greenland, but the description fits Iceland. Nicolo's health was broken by the cold of the western island, and he died soon after his return to the Faeroes, probably in 1395. Antonio Zeno and Earl Sinclair made another voyage westward, somewhere about 1400, "but, the wind changing to the southwest, the sea therefore becoming rough, the fleet ran before the wind for four days, and at last land was dis- covered." In returning to the Faeroes from this country, Zeno sailed steadily eastward for 20 days, and then for five days towards the southeast, seeing no land for the whole five and twenty days. The basis of the Venetian discovery of America rests upon the assumption that this land, upon which Antonio Zeno left Earl Sinclair to found a city, was Greenland. This is the conclusion of Richard Henry Major, who translated the Zeno narrative for the Hakluyt Society, and it is accepted by John Fiske in his Discovery of America. 1582. Relation of J.

Verrazano sailed from Madeira, January 17, 1524, and having struck the east coast of America, sailed along it from about the 34th to the 54th parallel of latitude. At latitude "41 deg. and 2 tierces" he notes a haven which "lieth open to the South halfe a league broad, and being entred within it betweene the East and the North, it stretcheth twelve leagues: where it waxeth broader and broader, and maketh a gulfe about 20. leagues in compasse, wherein are five small Islands very fruitful and pleasant, filll of hie and broade trees, among the which Islandes any great Nauie may ride safe without any feare of tempest or other danger. Afterwards turning towardes the South il the entring into the Hauen on both sides there are most pleasant hils, with many riuers of most cleare water falling into the Sea."

Marco Polo, 1254 (?)-1324, was of an aristocratic Venetian family which had a commercial house in Constantinople. In 1271, then a lad of seventeen, he accompanied his uncles, Nicol6 and Maffeo, on their second trading journey to Cathay, at that time under the rule of the great Kublai Khan, grand- son of the all-conquering Jenghis. Young Marco became proficient in speaking and writing Asiatic languages, and the Chinese annals of the year 1277 mention him as a com- missioner of the privy council. He remained in Kublai's service until 1292, when, in company with his uncles, he set out to return, arriving in Venice in 1295. Two years later, during a war between Venice and Genoa, he was taken prisoner, and held in durance for about a year. One of his companions in captivity was a certain Rusticiano, of Pisa, a compiler of French romances. Rusticiano was so charmed with Marco's tales of his adventures in Asia, that he wrote them down, not in Italian, but in French. The Italian version was prepared by G. B. Ramusio, and published in the second volume of his Navigationi e Viaggi. Some 80 MSS. of Marco Polo are known. 482</page><page sequence="19">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 483 The Book of Ser Marco Polo concerning the Kingdoms and Marvels of the East is one of the most famous books of the Middle Ages. Although some of the ' marvels' were stories of the fabulous 'kingdom of Prester John, and of the " one- eyed Arimaspians," still during his four and twenty years of travel Marco had learned more about the geography of the earth than any other traveller before his time. He was the first to describe the great empire of China, and he knew, or knew of, Thibet, Burmah, Siam, Cochin China, the Indian Archipelago, Java, Sumatra, Andaman, Hindustan, Japan, Siberia, Zanzibar, and Madagascar. Up to the close of the 13th century, the known geography of the world comprised Europe, with a fringe of Asia and Africa. It is no wonder that to Marco's contemporaries his sober statements of fact read like a fairy tale, or a romance of chivalry. 1625. A Discourse of the Kingdome of China, taken out of Ricius [lMatteo Ricci] and Trigautius. See Purchas his Pilgrimes, etc. Pt. 3. 1625. Folio. Matteo Ricci, 1552-1610, was an Italian Jesuit, who founded Christian missions in China. He adopted the Chinese dress, and taught Christianity in conformity with the general principles of morals he found prevalent among the Chinese. He wrote numerous works,'in Chinese, on moral subjects, and on geography, geometry, and arithmetic. In the Chinese annals he is called Li-ma-teu. Ricci's pleasant way of living on friendly terms with mandarins, and learned men, and his liberality of m nd in accepting the moral truths of Buddhism, were displeasing to the Dominicans. They accused him of heresy, and eventually the Jesuits were expelled from China.

Soon after its publication, he went to Ireland, under the patronage of Arthur, Lord Grey de Wilton, where he was sworn into the Privy Council, in 1580. He was knighted in 1589, and remained in Ireland as principal secretary of state through a succession of lord deputies. Fenton says in his Dedication to Queen Elizabeth,-"I am bold, under fear and timidity, to prostrate these my last pains afore that divine moderation of mind which always hath holden for acceptable all things respecting learning or virtuous labors."

The fact that he was himself a conspicuous actor in the scene enabled him to write with a peculiarly intimate knowledge of the events and the personages of contemporary politics. Keenly observant, he was in the habit of recording his impressions of men and things, and it was his mental turn to record them in the form of aphorisms. His history is, therefore, rather the maxims and memoranda of a statesman, scientifically arranged, than a philosophical view of human affairs. Montaigue observes acutely of Guicciardini's moral insen- sibility, his cold, passionless manner of depicting a great national tragedy, the decline and fall of his own country after the French invasion of 1494, 'among the many motives and counsels on which he adjudicates, he never attributes any one of them to virtue, religion, or conscience, as if all these were quite extinct in the world.'

British Museum. Machiavelli's Istorie Fiorentine was begun after 1520, at the instance of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici; it was com- pleted in 1527, and dedicated to Cardinal Giulio, then Pope Clement VII. It recounts, in eight books, the whole story of Florence from the earliest times down to the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, in 1492. It is not, however, a chronicle of events, but rather a national biography, written from Machiavelli's political point of view. Having formulated a theory of the state in the Principe and the Discorsi, he applies these abstract principles to the example furnished by the Florentine republic. In literary form Machiavelli modelled his history upon Livy, a peculiarly happy choice for a his- torian in whom the personal equation and the sense of literary perspective are the strongest qualities. Following the classi- cal manner, he inserts here and there speeches, which partly embody his own comments on situations of importance, and partly express what he thought dramatically appropriate to particular personages. The story of Rosamund's revenge upon Alboin, found in the Istorie Fiorentine, libro i, is the subject of two Elizabethan dramas. 1. The Tragedy of Albovine, King of the Lombards. Sir William D'Avenant. Printed, 1629. Plot also found in Bandello, iii. 18; Belleforest, Histoires Tragiques, iv. 19; Queen Margaret's Heptameron, Nov. 32. 2. The Witch. Thomas Middleton. Printed, 1770. The most important intrigue of the tangled plot of The Witch is again the tragedy of Rosamund and Alboin. Ward (History of English Dramatic Literature, ii. 509, and iii. 169, 496</page><page sequence="33">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 497 1899) thinks that both Middleton and D'Avenant found the tale in Belleforest. 1595.

He was probably the Abraham Hartwell, of Trinity College, Cambridge, who took his B. A. degree in 1571, M. A., in 1575, and was made an M. A. of Oxford in 1588. About 1584, he became secretary to Archbishop Whitgift, to whom his three translations from the Italian are dedicated. He was an antiquarian of some note, and died rector of Tod- dington, Bedfordshire, where he founded a library. The date of his death is unknown. Although he was a translator of geographical writings, he was not himself a traveller, as has been asserted. Giovanni Tommaso Minadoi, 1540-1615, was a physician. After being graduated from the University of Padua, he became physician to the Venetian consulates in Constanti- nople and in Syria, where he collected the materials for his history of the wars between the Turks and Persians, 1576- 1588. On his return from the East, he was made physician to William of Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. In 1596, he was preferred to the professorship of medicine in the University of Padua. He died in 1615, in Florence, where he had been summoned by Cosimo II., Grand Duke of Tuscany. 1599. The Commonwealth and Gouernment of Venice.

Although cast in the form of comments on Livy, the Discorsi, in toto, is really an inquiry into the genesis and maintenance of the state. It is II Principe on a larger scale, copiously illustrated by historical examples, and enriched by the fruits of Machiavelli's own experience and observation. 506</page><page sequence="43">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 507 John Morley characterizes the two books clearly,-" in the Prince he lays down the conditions on which an absolute ruler, rising to power by force of genius backed by circum- stances, may maintain that power, with safety to himself and most advantage to his subjects; while in the Discourses he examines the rules that enable a self-governing state to retain its freedom. The cardinal precepts are the same. In either case, the saving principal is one: self-sufficiency, military strength, force, flexibility, address,-above all, no half- measures. In either case, the preservation of the state is equally the one end, reason of state equally the one ade- quate and sufficient test and justification of the means. The Prince deals with one problem, the Discourses with the other." As to the minor works translated by Dacres, Machiavelli's Life of Castruccio Costracani is more romance than history. Machiavelli describes Castruccio as a foundling, and depicts him when lord of Lucca as the ideal soldier and statesman. In fact, Castruccio was of the noble family of the Antel- minelli. He succeeded Uguccione della Faggiuola, lord of Pisa, at Lucca, in 1315, and was supported by the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, who created him duke of Lucca. Castruccio dominated all Tuscany, until his death, in 1328, enabled the Guelfs to breathe freely again. The story of Oliverotto da Fermo is told in the 8th chapter of the Prince. He was one of the captains of Cesare Borgia who revolted, and entered into a conspiracy against him. With many arts, Cesare got four of the conspirators to visit him at Sinigaglia, where two of them, Oliverotto and Vitel- lozzo,. were seized and forthwith strangled. It was only a year after Oliverotto had become tyrant of Fermo by murder- ing his uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, whom he had invited to a banquet for the express purpose of making way with him. The character of Machiavelli seems to have made a pro- found impression on the Elizabethan dramatists. Three plays are named after him.</page><page sequence="44">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. 1. Machiavel. An anonymous play, acted at the Rose theatre, and recorded in Henslow's Diary, under the date, March 2, 1592. 2. Machiavel and the Devil, a tragedy, by Robert Daborne. Daborne was in treaty with Henslow for this play between April 17, and June 25, 1613. It may have been the older play worked over. 3. Machiavellus. By D. Wiburne. A Latin play acted at Cambridge University, 1597. MS., of date 1600, Douce, 234, Bodleian. Shakspere alludes to Machiavelli three times,- "Alen9on, that notorious Machiavel." I. Hen. VI. v. 4.

Marlowe brings Machiavelli on the stage in person as the Prologue to the Jew of Malta, expressing his admiration for him in the lines,- "I count religion but a childish toy, And hold there is no sin but ignorance." Mr. Courthope, in his History of English Poetry, maintains that all of Marlowe's plays are but different conceptions of Machiavelli's principle of virtu. In this view Tamburlaine is the apotheosis of power as ambition; Barabbas, of power as revenge; Faustus, of overweening intellectual power. Whether Machiavelli did indeed revolutionize the English drama, as Mr. Courthope's interesting contention holds, certain it is that he was a familiar and popular figure on the stage. Making mere casual notes on the subject, I find sixteen dramatists, in twenty-six plays, all alluding to Mac- hiavelli in the same way, crediting him with the craft, malice, 508</page><page sequence="45">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 509 and hypocrisy of the devil. Mr. Edward Meyer, in his dissertation, Machiavelli and the Elizabethan Drama (Weimar, 1897), has collected 395 instances of Machiavelli's name, or supposed maxims, occurring in Elizabethan literature. As the Prince was not translated until 1640, Mr. Meyer argues that the source of Elizabethan Machiavellianism was Simon Patrick's translation of Innocent Gentillet's, Discours d'Estat sur les moyens de bien gouverner et mainte- nir en bonne paix un royaume et une principaute, contre Nicol. Machiavel. (1576.) The difficulty of this argument is, that, although the dedication of Patrick's translation is dated 1577, the book was not entered on the Stationers' Register, nor printed, until 1602. Many of the allusions belong to the sixteenth century. It is possible that Patrick's transla- tion may have been known in manuscript; it is also possible that many persons may have read Gentillet, either in the original Latin, or in French. From the vogue of Italian at the time, and from the constant travelling to and fro between England and Italy, I myself see no difficulty in supposing what must have been the fact, that educated Englishmen at least read Machiavelli in his own simple, unaffected, vivid Italian. Machiavelli is a writer who will never be read, except by the few, but his positive spirit, his practical method, is precisely of the sort that must have appealed most strongly to the Elizabethans. "We are much beholden," said Bacon, "to Machiavel and others that wrote what men do, and not what they ought to do." The Elizabethans were deeply interested in government, as the English have always been, and they had many perplex- ing problems, both in State and Church, to deal with. From abstract principles in the sphere of government, Machiavelli appealed to experience, for authority as the test of truth, he substituted scientific facts. All this seemed well enough to a people in the first blush of civil and religious freedom, but it was confusing, it was especially confusing when concretely applied to new and urgent moral questions,</page><page sequence="46">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. such as early Protestant England had to settle. The popular misconception of Machiavelli might easily have arisen in ignorance, it was certainly in the air, as Gentillet's book shows; it must have been added to by the Italian travellers' reporting half truths; Marlowe's extravagant admiration undoubtedly overleaped the mark; and lastly, there is the vitiun gentis, the natural antipathy of race and morale, to intensify the current opinion. Lord Burghley and Elizabeth probably rated Machiavelli nearest his proper worth, and it is well known that both these great personages walked in devious paths. "Party Govern- ment is not the Reign of the Saints," wittily says John Morley, in his brilliant Romanes lecture on Machiavelli, and goes on to show that among the canonized saints of the Roman Church, there have been but a dozen kings in eight centuries, and no more than four popes. "So hard has it been," he adds, quoting Cosmo de' Medici, "to govern the world by paternosters." 1641. An History of the Ciuill Warres of England betweene the two howses of Lancaster and Yorke.

My next inducing reason is; That the subject of both parts of this Treatise being Civill Warres, and this Second comming forth in a Time of Civill Warres in the Same Countrey, I hope I may be excused for doing what in me lies to perswade to a Happy Peace: whereunto I know no more powerfuill Argument, then by shewing the Miseries of Warre, which is a Tragedie that alwaies destroyes the Stage whereon it is acted; and</page><page sequence="48">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. which when it once seizeth upon a Land rich in the plenty of a Long Peace, and full with the Surfeit of Continued Ease, seldome leaves Purging those Superfluities, till All (not only Superfluous but meere Necessaries) be wasted and consumed, as is sufficiently made to appeare throughout this whole History." 1642. Discourses upon Cornelius Tacitus. Translated into English by Sir R. [ichard] B. [aker]. London. 1642. Folio. Biitish Museum. A translation of the Marquese Malvezzi's, Discorsi sopra il libro primo degli Annali di Cornelio Tacito. Venetia. 1622. 4to. Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito. Venetia. 1635. 4to. British Museum, (2 copies). Sir Richard Baker, 1568-1645, made this translation of Malvezzi's Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito for a bookseller named Whittaker. It was one of the literary works with which he occupied himself in the Fleet prison, where he lived from about 1635 until his death. It is impossible to mention Sir Richard Baker without referring to his famous book, the Chronicle of the Kings of England from the time of the Romans' Government unto the Death of King James, which appeared in 1643. Baker's Chronicle was reprinted ten times up to 1733, was continued to the year 1658 by Edward Phillips, Milton's nephew (1660), was abridged (1684), and was translated into Dutch (1649). It is written in a pleasant, readable style, and was long popular with country gentlemen. Addison represents Sir Roger de Coverley as well posted in his Chronicle, which he always kept lying in his hall window. One of the most humorsome papers of the Spectator is that (No. 329, March 18, 1712) describing Sir Roger's going through Westminster Abbey with Baker's Chronicle on the tip of his tongue. Before the figure of Queen Elizabeth's maid of honor who died from the prick of her needle, he wonders why Sir 512</page><page sequence="49">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 513 Richard Baker has said nothing about her; he informs the Spectator that Edward the Confessor was the first who touched for the evil; Henry IV. reminds him that "there was fine reading in the casualties of that reign;" upon the whole, he observes with some surprise, that Sir Richard Baker "had a great many kings in him whose monuments he had not seen in the Abbey." So, Fielding, in Joseph Andrews, refers to Baker's Chronicle as part of the furniture of Sir Thomas Booby's house. There is one notable accuracy in Baker's Chronicle; it gives for the first time the correct date of the poet Gower's death. 1647. The Pourtract of the Politicke Christian-Favourite.

Popolo di Napoli.) Venetia. 1647. 8vo. British Museum. (Eight editions between 1647 and 1844 in the British Museum.) Masaniello (Tommaso Aniello) was a young fisherman of Amalfi who led a popular uprising in Naples during the summer of 1647. The cause of the civil revolution was the heavy taxation of the Spanish Government then in possession of Naples, and particularly the duty on fruits, both green and dry. The first riot, incited by Masaniello, broke out on Sunday, July 7, 1647, and lasted ten days; on the third day Masaniello was made Captain-General, or Absolute Patron, of the city, and as Howell translates, "from an humble, judicious, and zelous spirit which raign'd in him; he became proud, a Fool and a Tyrant." After a rule of but eight days and eight hours, he was assassinated, July 16, 1647. The Second Part of Massaniello describes the continuation of the civil war, the intervention of the French commanded by the Duke of Guise, and the subjugation of the city by Spain, in 1648, under the leadership of Don John of Austria. 1650.

The Ragguagli di Parnasso represents Apollo, seated upon Parnassus, hearing the complaints of all who come before him, and distributing justice according to absolute desert. Boccalini was a keen and daring wit, and his book, which is a sort of Dunciad, is full of lively satire on the lives and writings of famous Italians, His touch is light, with a fantastic turn, and some of his hits are extremely happy. Apropos of Guicciardini's longwindedness, he relates this pleasantry,- A citizen of Lacedaemon having said in three words what could be said in two (a capital crime in Sparta), was con- demned-to read Guicciardini's history of the Pisan war. He read the first pages in a mortal sweat; then utterly unable to go on with it, he ran and threw himself at the feet of his judges, beseeching them to imprison him for life, to send him to the galleys, to burn him alive, anything rather than prolong his intolerable weariness in reading Guicciardini.

Rigutini, in his edition of II Cortigiano (Barbera, 1889), accounts for 45 Italian editions of the book before his own; he also enumerates three Latin translations of it, two Spanish, two French, and one English. In this bibliography, not intended to be complete, I have mentioned 66 editions or reprints of II Cortigiano, in five languages. The Italians call it the " Golden Book." The first English edition contains "A Letter of syr I. Cheekes. To his loving frind Mayster Thomas Hoby," in which Sir John Cheeke says of the English language, "I am of this opinion that our own tung shold be written cleane and pure, unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges." To the first Latin edition, by Bartholomew Clerke, is pre- fixed a Latin Epistle by Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, and Earl of Dorset, author of Gorboduc, the earliest English tragedy. Clerke's Latin translation is highly commended by Sir John Harrington, in the preface to his translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso. 1591. The Huth Library copy of the Courtyer belonged to the poet Southey, and contains his autograph and bookplate. 11 Cortigiano is dedicated by the author, Count Baldessare Castiglione, to Don Michele de Silva, Bishop of Viseo; by the English translator, Sir Thomas Hoby, " To Right Honour- able the Lord Henry Hastinges, sonne and heire apparent to the noble Earle of Huntington."

The best book that ever was written upon good breeding, II Cortigiano, by Castiglione, grew up at the little court of Urbino, and you should read it." Boswell's Johnson. Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. 2nd. Oct. 1773. G. Birkheck Hill, v, p. 276. Count Baldessare Castiglione, 1478-1529, was a Mantuan who spent his life in the service first of the Duke of Milan and afterwards of Giudubaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. One of his diplomatic journeys took him to Eng- land, whence, in 1507, he carried home, from Henry VII., the Order of the Garter, for his master, the Duke of Urbino. II Cortigiano, the result of its author's travels and observa- tions and social experiences, represents the highest conception of manners of the Renaissance. It is a mixed type of manners, in that the education of letters of the Renaissance is engrafted upon the martial discipline of feudal times. In form, II Cortigiano is modelled on the Decameron, of Boccaccio, and the De Oratore, of Cicero. It is a dialogue supposed to be carried on by a distinguished company of ladies and gentle- men who are assembled at the Court of Urbino. Among these personages the chief are Giuliano de' Medici, called II Magnifico, afterwards Pope Clement VII.; Ottaviano Fregoso, afterwards Doge of Genoa; Cardinal Bernardo Bibbiena, author of Calandra; Cardinal Bembo, author of Gli Asolani; L'Unico Aretino; Elizabetta Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino; and Emilia Pia, Countess of Montefeltro. The subject of discussion agreed upon is that proposed by Messer Federigo Fregoso, "the perfect courtier, what are all the conditions and particular qualifications required of the man who shall deserve that name." 526</page><page sequence="63">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 527 The discussion is continued through four evenings, taking up the subject under four heads: (1) Of the form and manner of a court life; (2) Of the qualifications of a courtier; (3) Of the court lady; (4) Of the duty of a prince. The debate on the first evening, on the form and manner of a court life, is conducted by Count Lodovico da Canossa. Following the chivalric ideal, it is laid down that the perfect courtier should be a man of birth, a good horseman, and able to swim, leap, cast the stone, and play tennis. In the education of letters, he should be able to speak and write well, imitating the diction of the best writers, of whom, in the vulgar tongue, Boccaccio and Petrarch are praised as models. Further, the perfect courtier ought to be more than moderately instructed in polite letters, he should understand Greek and Latin literature also, 'on account of the variety of things that are written in those languages with great accuracy and beauty.' So in the other arts of expression, he should know something of music, and be able to play upon the lute; some skill also in painting increases the knowledge of the beautiful and cultivates the taste. On the second evening, the debate is led by the proposer, Messer Federigo Fregoso, who develops a lively and enter- taining discussion of wit and humor. Among many sprightly bon mots, here is one or two,- The Bishop of Cervia said to the Pope, "Holy Father, the whole court and city will have it that you have pitched upon me for governor." "Let the fools talk," replied the Pope, "you may assure yourself there is not a word of truth in it." Marc' Antonio, being one day exasperated by some words of Botton da Cesena, cried, "0 Botton, Botton, the time will surely come when thou shalt be the button and a halter the button-hole." Julian de Medici leads the conversation of the third even- ing, on the court lady. The conception of woman brought out is made up partly of the formal and sentimental ideas of</page><page sequence="64">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. the old Cours d'Amour, and partly of the colorless feminine light o' love introduced into Italian literature, to its immense damage, by Boccaccio, together with a smack of Platonism. The sentimental, Platonic lady is ably defended by the Mag- nifico, while the disparager of women is Signor Gasparo Pallavicino. Signor Ottaviano Fregoso conducts the final debate, on the duty of a prince. It is held that a monarchy, under a good prince, is the best constituted government, although Bembo prefers a republic 'because liberty is one of the excellent gifts of God.' In this book Castiglione quotes himself on the Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry VIII. He says that 'in this prince nature seemed to try to outdo herself by uniting in him alone enough excellencies for an infinity of men.' George Wyndham (Introduction to The Poems of Shake- speare) thinks that Shakspere derived the Platonic philosophy of his Sonnets from the Courtyer. As the Courtyer was far and away the most popular Elizabethan translation from the Italian, it is more than likely than Shakspere was familiar with it. Among other suggestions which might be made to strengthen this supposition, it may be pointed out that the Countess Emilia Pia is the type of witty, sprightly lady that Boccaccio first made known in Pampinea, and who is, in English, our fascinating Beatrice. I note two allusions to The Courtyer in the Elizabethan drama; in Westward Hoe, i. 1, by Webstor and Dekker, and in Marston's The Malcontent, i. 1, where Malevole says to Bilioso,- "Adieu, my treu court-friend: farewell, my dear Castilio."

So it chaunced on a day that the aungell of God appered unto hym, in lykenesse of a yonge man, and sayd unto hym, come wyth me, for God will that I doe showe thee of hys secret Justyce; and dyd leade him into the towne, to a marchauntes house, whyche had in a coffre a great number of florences. And the aungell, in the syghte of the hermyte, did take the same florence, and did beare them into the house of another man, whych they founde in sleepe, and the aungell dyd leue the sayde florence at hys chambre dore, to the intente that when he should open the dore, that he should fynde them; and thys doone, he ledde hym to the house of another marchaunte that had a chylde, the whyche chylde the aungell dyd kyll, in the presence of the sayde heremite, and the heremite seinge all these thynges, thoughte that the aungell had ben a deuyll, and wolde fayne haue. departed from hym. The aungell, seinge that he woulde depart from hym, sayde unto hym, tarye yet a litle, for I wyll showe thee the reason, wherfore I haue doone these thinges in thy presence; knowe first wherfore that I haue taken the florence from the burges; it is because that he had solde his herytage for the sayde florences, and was purposed to gyue them to certaine murtherers, whyche liad promysed hym to kyll a man for hys sake, the whyche had 530</page><page sequence="67">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 531 dyspleased hym aforetymes; and the man which he wolde haue caused to be kylled, is a man of noble byrth, wherof shuld haue come greate inconuenyence, and therfore to resyst the euyl that might haue come therof, and also to let hym of hys euyll, and myscheuous wyll and purpose, I haue taken the sayde florence from hym; and when he shal see hym selfe pore and to haue loste hys herytage and goodes, he wyll gyue hymselfe to the seruice of God, and where he shulde haue ben dampned nowe he shalbe saued. The reason wherfore I haue born the florence to the chambre doore of the other man, is because that he was a ryche marchaunte whyche came from beyonde the sea, and had bestowed in marchaundyce all the goodes that he had, and putte it in a shyppe, the whych shyppe did peryshe upon the sea, then he did remembre one daye howe that he had loste all hys gooddes, and had nothynge to lyue uppon, began to fall in dyspayre, and was purposed to hang hym selfe, and therfore to the intente that he shoulde not destroye bothe the bodye and the soule, I dyd beare hym the foresaid florences. The reason whereof I haue kylled the chylde, is because that afore that the father had him he was a very good man, and gaue much almons, and did many good dedes for the lone of God; and sence that he had the chylde, he cared for none other thynge, but onelye to get rychesse, were it by ryghte or wronge, and therefore I haue kylled the chylde, to the intente that the father maye retourne to hys purpose; doe not meruayle nor grudge therfore, for the syckenesse that thou haste, for if it hadde not bene, thou shoulde ofte tymes haue thy mynde and courage in vanytyes wherby thou shoulde greatlye haue dyspleased God; and be thou sure, that God doth nothyng, but by reason, but the persones haue not knowledge therof, for God hathe not promysed it them, but of two euylles he dothe allwayes take the lesse. And, this said, the aungell dyd departe from the heremyte.

Censura Literaria, Vol. vII, p. 225 (Ed. 1808). The apologue of the Angel and Hermit is one of the stories of the Gesta Romanorum, MSS. Harl. 2270, ch.

A second translation of the Gesta Romanorum, made by Richard Robinson, went through six impressions between 1577 and 1601. Besides the versions of the Boke of Wisdome and of these two translations of the Gesta Romanorum, there are four later ones in English.

It is entitled,- A most full, though figurative Story, to shew that God Almighties Wayes and inscrutable Decrees are not to be com- prehended by Humane Fancies.

Letter 4, of Howell's Letters, published between 1647 and 1650, and p. 7 of the edition of 1655. The story is also found in the Divine Dialogues (Pt. I., p. 321. Dialogue II. Edit. London. 1668. 12mo.), of Dr. Henry More, the Platonist, where it is enriched with interesting moral reflections. And Thomas Parnell closely follows More in The Hermit, his most popular poem. W. C. T. Dobson, royal academician, contributed " The Hermit," with a quotation from Parnell, to the Academy Exhibition of 1842. Parnell's version is said to be the tenth-the story, like many another one, having originated in Arabic, and come into English by a natural process of descent. 532</page><page sequence="69">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 533 The story is inserted in the twentieth chapter of Voltaire's Zadig, De l'Hermite qu' un Ange conduisit dans le siOcle.

Investigation of Dimnah's conduct, and his defence of himself. In the Indian fable Kalilah and Dimnah are two jackals, who are courtiers at the gate of the King, Pingalaka, the lion; but Kalilah in Doni appears as l'asino and Dimnah as il mulo. Sir Thomas North translated the first part only of Doni's work, which goes on, in the same volume, freshly and con- tinuously paged, with six treatises, entitled, "Trattati diversi di Sendebar Indiano filosopho morale. Allo illustriss, et excel- lentiss. S. Cosimo de Medici dedicati." [Engraving bearing the motto 'Fiorenza.'] In Uinegia nell' Academia Peregrina. MDLII; and at the end (p. 103) stands 'In Uinegia per Francesco Marcolini. MDLII.' The book of Kalilah and Dimnah is a collection of tales supposed to be related to a King of India by his philosopher, in order to enforce some particular moral or rule of conduct. In many of the stories the characters are animals thinking and acting just like men and women. Originally Sanskrit, the book passed from Buddhist literature into Persian, and thence into nearly every known Oriental and modern lan- guage. Doni's "Moral Filosophia," for example, is based on the Latin of John of Capua, "Directorium humanae vitae, vel ParaboleAntiquorum Sapientum (1263-1278, printed, 1480(?)) and this, in its turn, upon a Hebrew translation from the Arabic. In its migrations, from the Sanskrit original of the Pant- chatantra, though Persian and Arabic, the names of both king and philosopher vary. Bidpai, or Pilpai, the philosopher of the Persian version known as the "Lights of Canopus," or, in English, the Fables of Pilpay, is a wise Brahmin who lives in a cave of the holy mountain of Ceylon. Doni's Sendebar is from Sandabar, the name of the philosopher in the Hebrew</page><page sequence="72">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. version from which John of Capua translated. Possibly this form is a reminiscence of Shanzabeh, the Sanskrit name of the ox in the well-known story of the Lion and the Ox which is the opening tale of the original Indian book. In the Trattati diversi the king is Fr. Strrza, Duke of Milan, the philosopher is maestro Dino filosofo Fiorentino, and the scenes and personages are all Italian. Dino may be an anagram of Doni. 1573. Cardanus Comforte translated into English [by Thomas Bedingfield]. And published by commaundement of the Right Hon. the Earl of Oxenford. T.

Milano. 1559. 8vo. British Museum. Giovanni della Casa, 1500-1556, Archbishop of Bene- vento, Petrarchist, and author of Galateo, has been called the Italian Chesterfield. Galateo is an admirable treatise on good manners. Differing from Castiglione's II Cortigiano, which prescribes the training and discipline of the man of birth and position, Galateo aims to be a guide to the average gentleman in his intercourse with his equals. Like the Courtier, it has enjoyed enduring fame, because its precepts of conduct are based on those general principles of mutual respect and tolerance which hold good for all peoples and at all times. Both books perhaps have been saved from the perverse fate of manuals of etiquette in general by the fact that in a simple, dignified way, and witlh singular distinction 538</page><page sequence="75">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 539 of style, they recognize the final sanction of tact as the mark of education and culture, and inculcate the importance of it as a universal social duty. The title of Galateo passed into a proverb. 'To teach the Galateo' is synonymous, in Italian, with 'to teach good manners.' Galateo is said to have been in real life a certain Galeazzo Florimonte of Sessa. Galateo discusses social conduct with much particularity, instructing the young man on such points as the proper use of the drinking-glass at table, the employment of the napkin, how to dress the hair, etc. I quote a page or two from one of the old editions: "The treatise of Master Jhon Della Casa, wherin under the person of an old unlearned man, instructing a youthe of his, he hath talke of the maners," etc. "To rise up where other men doe sit and talke, and to walke up and downe the chamber, it is no poynt of good manner. Also there be some that so buskell them selues, reache, streatch, and yawn, writhing now one syde, and then another, that a man would weene, they had some feuer uppon them. A manifest signe, that the companye they keepe, doth weary them. Likewise doe they very yll, yt now and then pull out a letter out of theyr pocket, to reade it; as if they had greate matters of charge, and affaires of the common weale committed unto them. But they are much more to be blamed, that pull out theyr knyves or their scisers, and doe nothing els but pare their nayles, as if they made no account at all of the company, and would seeke some other solace to passe the time awaye. Theis fashions to, must be left, that some men use, to sing betwene the teeth, or play the dromme with their fingers, or shoofle their feete; for these demeanours shewe that a body is carelesse of any man ells." "A man must beware that he say, not those things, which unsaid in silence would make the tale plesaunt inoughe, and, peraduenture, geue it a better grace to leaue them out. As to say thus, 'such a one that was the sonne of such a one, that</page><page sequence="76">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. dwelt in Cocomer street; do you not knowe him ? he married the daughter of Gianfigliazzi, the leane scragg that went so much to St. Laraunce. No, you do not know him? why, do you not remember the goodly strayght old man that ware long haire downe to his shoulders?' For if it were nothing materiall to the tale, whether this chaunce befell him, or him, all thys long babble, and fond and folishe questions, were but a tale of a Tubbe; to no purpose, more then to weary mens eares that harken to it, and long to understand the end." "To weare a toothpicke, about your neck, of all fashions that is the worst, for, besides that it is a baued jewell for a gentleman to pull forth of his bosome, and putteth men in mind of those tooth drawers that sit on their benche in the stretes; it makes men also to thinke that the man loues his belly fill well, and is prouided for it, and I see no reason, why they should not as well carry a spoone, about their neckes, as a toothe picke." "Some men there be, that have a pride or a use to drawe their mouthes a little awry, or twinckle up their eye, and to blow up their cheekes and to puffe, and to make with their countenance sundrie such like foolishe and ilfauoured faces and gestures, I councell men to leaue them cleane, for Pallas herselfe, the goddesse, (as I haue hearde some wise men say) tooke once a great pleasure to sound the flute and the cornet; and therin she was verie cunning.

Books I., II. and III. were printed separately in 1581, 4to., and were dedicated to Lady Norris by George Pettie. Lady Norris was Marjorie, wife of Sir Henry Norris, Baron Norris of Rycote. Sir Henry and Lady Norris were personal friends of Queen Elizabeth, who playfully nicknamed Lady Marjorie her 'black crow,' in allusion to the lady's dark complexion. A striking monument in St. Andrew's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, commemorates this worthy couple and their six sons. Life-size figures of Lord and Lady Norris lie beneath an elaborate canopy supported by marble pillars, while around them kneel effigies of their children. An English translation of La civil conversatione, of 1738, is entitled The Art of Conversation. I have found no trace of Pettie's French original. The banquet at Casale is intended as an exemplification of the rules of polite society laid down in the book, and for this purpose the company is described in the minutest detail- what the six lords and four ladies talked about, what games they played, how they supped, and all their doings up to their dispersal.</page><page sequence="80">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. 1595.

The Epitome of good manners at the end is the Galateo of Giovanni della Casa, already translated in 1576, by Robert Peterson. The Invectives are a series of theophrastic sentences upon the general text, 'player is now a name of contempt.' The whole tract possesses a unique interest, because, published in the year of Shakspere's death, the character of the player presented in it, his virtues and his defects, shows plainly the social stigma which was then attached, both to the poet who wrote for the stage, and to the player who interpreted his works. Shakspere's Sonnets, 110 and 111, reveal how he smarted under it. Ben Jonson, in the Hawthornden Conversations, says with characteristic bluntness, "Poetry had beggared him, when he might have been a rich lawyer, physician, or merchant." Beaumont was born a gentleman, and the fact that his name appears first on the title-page of The Scornful Lady, published in this same year, immediately after his death, would seem to indicate that he did not care to be known as a playwright during his lifetime. 1637.

Robert Gentili, his son, was a prodigy of learning as a boy, but left only a few translations from the Italian, of which the best known is the History of the Inquisition, from the Italian of Father Paul [Paolo Servita], 1639.

Consecrato al molto illustre. . . Cavalliero Sig. P. Sidneo. [By Giordano Bruno.] Stampato in Parigi [or rather by T. Vautrollier, London,] 1584. 8vo. British Museum. The Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante, or Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, is an allegory set forth in three dialogues. The gods are represented as resolving to banish the constella- 554</page><page sequence="91">ELIZABETHAN TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN. 555 tions out of heaven, because so many of them recorded their loose lives, and to substitute the moral virtues in the firma- ment in their stead. The first dialogue, which ostensibly censures classical mythology, is really an attack on all forms of anthropomorphic religion. This is the gist of the argument of the piece, but the second dialogue is the most important from the philosophical point of view, for here Bruno discourses of Truth, Prudence, Wisdom, Law, Universal Judgment, and the other moral virtues which take the places of the beasts. His treatment of the virtues makes clear the essence of his philosophy. Truth, he explains, is the unity and substance which underlies all things; Prudence, or Providence, is the regulating power of truth, and includes at once liberty and necessity; Wisdom is Providence itself in its supersensible aspect, in man, it is reason which grasps the truth of things; Law naturally proceeds from Wisdom, for every good law must be rational, and have for its object the welfare of all; by Universal judgment men are judged with absolute justice, by their actual deeds, not by their religious beliefs, which may or may not make for righteousness. Many of Bruno's ideas have affinities with the philosophy of Spinoza, but the bold, mocking spirit of the Italian gives a character to the Spaccio that is all its own. Bruno girds at the monks, he scoffs at the mysteries of faith, to him the miracles are 'magical tricks,' Jewish record and Greek myth are all one. The Roman Catholic Church was correct in recognizing underneath the allegory a vehement attack on the established religion. In many respects the Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante is the most remarkable work of Bruno as it is decidedly the most popular. One phase of its popularity is especially interesting to English readers; it is the source of Thomas Carew's masque, Coelum Britannicurn, acted at Whitehall by King Charles I. and the noblemen of his Court, on Shrove Tuesday .night, Feb. 18, 1633. The masque was written in compliment to</page><page sequence="92">MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. King Charles I. and Queen Henrietta Maria, praising the temperance, chastity, and justice of the royal pair. As in the Spaccio, Heaven is divested of its gods and goddesses, in whose stead shines first the King, "the bright Pole-starre of this Hemispheare," by his side his "faire Con- sort," and a "Noble traine, of either sexe;" So to the Brittish stars this lower Globe Shall owe its light, and they alone dispence To the world a pure refined influence. The closing scene of the masque represents the moral virtues, Religion, Truth, Wisdom, Concord, Government, and Reputation, seated on clouds, with Eternity on a Globe in their midst. Fifteen stars express fifteen 'stellified British Heroes,' among them 'Prince Arthur' and 'the brave St. George.' 1584. Hugonis Platti armig.

Con l'aggiunta dell' Asino Cillenico, etc. By Giordano Bruno. Parigi [or rather London,] 1585. 8vo. British Museum. This is a treatise on the different kinds of ignorance, or asinity, whether dogmatic or pedantic or purely sceptical and uninquiring. Its purpose is to rouse men to free and intelligent thought, and Bruno wrote it as "The awakener of sleeping minds" (dormitantium animorum excubitor-his style for himself in his letter to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, prefixed to his Spiegazione di trenta sigilli, 1583). The satirical conclusion of the work is, that asinity is the highest human duty, and to it is assigned divine favor both in this world and the next. Bruno's warfare with dogma, superstition and ignorance, in the Spaccio de la Bestia Trion- fante goes on in the Caballa del Cavallo Pegaseo. In this sense the ideal and cabalistic ass is the Triumphant Beast of Dogma in real flesh and blood. Hence, and it is explained</page><page sequence="94">8MARY AUGUSTA SCOTT. with many particulars as to asses in the Old and New Testa- ments, and in the ancient writers, the spiritual and moral ass is everywhere as much esteemed as the physical and material ass is appreciated by particular communities. A cynical sonnet erects asinity into a saint or goddess, 0 sainted Asinity. Ignorance most holy! etc. 1585. G. Bruno Nolano. De Gl'Heroici Furori. Al molto illustre. ... Cavalliero, Signor P. Sidneo. Appresso Antonio Baio, Parigi, [or rather by T. Vautrollier, London,] 1585. 8vo. British Museum. Thinking of the similarity of Shelley to Bruno, John Owen, in his Skeptics of the Italian Renaissance, compares Gli eroici furori to the Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, and the Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante to Prometheus Unbound. Cicada, one of the characters in the dialogue, Gli eroici furori, says,-" How much better is a worthy and heroic death than a disgraceful and vile success." " On that propo- sition," responds the poet Tansillo, "I composed this sonnet," whereupon Bruno borrows from Tansillo the verses which have been generally accepted as his own prediction of his fate. The sestet reads,- Soaring I hear my trembling heart's refrain " Where bearest me, O rash one ? The fell steep Too arduous is not climb'd without much pain." " Fear not," I answer, " for the fatal leap, Serene I cleave the clouds and death disdain, If death so glorious heaven will that I reap." 1585.

A dedicatory letter to Cosmo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, eulogizes Sir Francis Bacon, praising him not only for the qualities of his intellect, but also for those of the heart and will, and moral understanding; " being a man most sweet in his conversation and ways, grave in his judgment, invariable in his fortunes, splendid in his expenses; a friend unalterable to his friends; an enemy to no man; a most hearty and indefatigable servant to the king, and a most earnest lover of the Public,-having all the thoughts of that large heart of his set upon adorning the age in which he lives, and benefit- ing as far as possible the whole human race." Sir Toby Matthew and Sir Francis Bacon became friends as young men together in Parliament, and their affection knew no break through every variation of both their fortunes. Bacon held a high opinion of Matthews's literary judgment, and submitted his writings to him for criticism from time to time, among other pieces his book, De Sapientia Veterum, with an accompanying letter dated Feb. 17, 1610. In the last year of Bacon's life, at Sir Toby Matthews's special request, he added his Essay on Friendship to the series, in commemoration of their lifelong intimacy. 1619.
