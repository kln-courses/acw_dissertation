Ronquillo National Museum INTRODUCTION Man, since his first appearance on the planet some 2.5 million years ago, has made use of caves and rockshelters. Throughout the long period of man's prehistory, caves and rockshelters have served him as shelters, burial grounds, and ceremonial places. Nineteenth century archaeologists unearthed man-made stone tools from caves in France, which served as di? rect evidences of prehistoric man's activities. The discovery becomes sig? nificant when it is noted that the prevailing belief then, even among the prominent men of science, was that the earth was only 6000 years old. That the earth had existed for millions of years slowly became the ac? cepted paradigm as a result of succeeding overwhelming evidences from the geological and archaeological sciences. Archaeological researches in the Philippines in the last thirty years substantiate the fact that numerous caves and rockshelters all over the country were used by the early Filipinos during the prehistoric period as habitation, burial and ceremonial sites (Ronquillo 1985). These include the hundreds of caves and rockshelters recorded at Penablanca, Cagayan Prov? ince (Ronquillo &amp; Santiago 1977), on Bohol Island (Santiago 1982), on Panay Island (Courts 1983), on Samar Island (Hutterer 1969), on Palawan Island (Fox 1970) and in southeastern Mindanao (Solheim et al. 1979). Paper submitted to the National Seminar-Workshop on Cave Management and Con? servation, 7-9 October 1993.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN CAVES IN THE COUNTRY Caves, rockshelters and overhangs used by our prehistoric ancestors fall into various archaeological categories, namely, 1) habitation sites - ar? eas which they used as their homes as indicated by their activities as shown by the artifacts they left behind, such as potteries and stone tools and other, related materials, such as food remains; 2) burial sites - areas used as places for burying their dead, which included placing the dead in jars or in intricately-designed wooden coffins; and 3) ceremonial sites - ar? eas where rituals took place as may be indicated by paintings and/or inci? sions on the walls of the caves or rockshelters as well as other cultural material evidences left behind indicating use as offerings. In numerous cases, as shown by systematic archaeological excavations, caves indicate multiple uses delineated by the above activities. Five noteworthy archaeological sites in caves and rockshelters located in different parts of the country (Fig. 1) are summarized and presented be? low: 1. Quezon, Palawan Island From 1962 through 1966 archaeologists from the National Museum conducted exploration and excavation activities in the island of Palawan, concentrating their work at Lipuun Point, a limestone promontory in the municipality of Quezon. Hundreds of caves and rockshelters are known to exist in the area, many of which are potential archaeological sites. Archae</page><page sequence="3">140 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY * V 0 ^^^^ vVi,, n- - fx ? - ' ^ Fig. 1. Noteworthy archaeological sites in caves and rockshelters discussed in this paper.</page><page sequence="4">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL VALUES OF CAVES 141 ological work in the Tabon Caves resulted in the establishment of the first reliable evidence for a very early human presence in the Philippines. Six successive periods of human occupation were identified at Tabon Cave, covering a period of over 30,000 years. The radiocarbon dates generated from this cave range from as early as 30,000 years ago to as late as 9,500 years ago. The results of the archaeological work at the Tabon Caves have been published (Fox 1970). They include data on the recovery of human bone fragments, which, although recovered from a disturbed area of the cave, have been dated from 22,000 to 24,000 years ago - so far the earliest skeletal evidence for Homo sapiens in the Philippines. 2. Penablanca, Cagayan Province In 1976 and 1977 over a hundred caves and rockshelters were recorded from the limestone formation of Penablanca, Cagayan Province. More than fifty are archaeological sites and nine have been excavated by the National Museum (Ronquillo &amp; Santiago 1977). The different radiocarbon dates available from the excavated caves at the Penablanca Limestone Formation range in date from as early as 14,000 B.C. in Callao Cave to as late as A.D. 50 in Arku Cave (Bronson &amp; White 1992:486-487). The main objective of the Penablanca Archaeological Project was to determine the variability in the stone tool technology at the area and de? lineate them in time and space. Interest was in the method of manufacture as well as in the plausible functions of the stone tools recovered from the different cave sites excavated (Ronquillo 1981). Preliminary results of the analysis of the animal remains from a num? ber of excavated cave and rocksheiter sites at Penablanca indicate the ex? ploitation of a broad resource base by hunters and gatherers, who may have had contacts with sedentary agriculturalists (Henson 1978). 3. Anda Peninsula, Bohol Province In 1981 archaeologists from the National Museum undertook survey and exploration activities in the limestone formation of the Anda Peninsula and the Mabini area in southeastern Bohol. The aim of the project was to determine potential archaeological areas and point out key priority sites</page><page sequence="5">142 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY containing evidences relevant to the interpretion of the prehistory of the is? land (Santiago 1982). The archaeological survey and exploration area was chosen based on reports of local residents on the existence of burial sites situated along the coastal areas of Cogtong Bay. Over one hundred and fifty (150) caves, rockshelters, and overhangs were recorded, twenty seven (27) of which have been identified as archae? ological sites. Nine caves have been excavated. The sites encountered indi? cated habitation, burial and places where religious activities had been performed. Archaeological research in Bohol has revealed the widespread practice of wooden coffin burials in caves and rockshelters, whose dates may range from the Developed Metal Age to the Protohistoric Period. These wooden coffins were carved from logs and had a predominantly rep? tile design on the lid. These were noted to have been used both for primary and for secondary burials. Judging by the archaeological explorations un? dertaken in 1981, the archaeological potential of caves and rockshelters in Bohol Island is great. 4. Maitum, Sarangani Province One of the most recent significant finds by archaeologists from the Na? tional Museum is the anthropomorphic burial jars discovered at Ayub Cave, Maitum, Sarangani Province. These low-fired earthenware jars con? tained secondary burials - with incomplete human skeletal remains. The site is situated in the coastal area of Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani Province and is "approximately 1000 meters due south of the Mindanao Sea shore? line (from Pinol) with an elevation of 6 meters above mean sea level" (Di zon 1991:3). Ayub Cave was found to have been severely disturbed by treasure hunters. Digging was done in the front part as well as in the central and rear portions of the cave. The broken pieces of anthropomorphic jars were haphazardly placed on the surface alongside the walls of the cave by the il? legal diggers. Fragments from at least twenty-five (25) restorable secondary burial jars were recovered. The covers of the jars were in the shape of human heads. The bodies of the jars show complete sets of shoulders, arms, breasts and hands. It was noted that "some ears, mouth and chin of the heads are appliqued while others are directly molded with the head" (Di</page><page sequence="6">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL VALUES OF CAVES 143 zon 1991:4). A number of these earthenware heads were noticeably painted with red (hematite) and black (possibly manganese). Directly associated with the burial jars were intricately decorated earth? enware jarlets, glass beads and bracelets, earthenware beads and shell im? plements and ornaments (Dizon et al. 1992:4). On the basis of the associated materials the site is dated to the Metal Age, ca. 500 B.C. 5. Sanga Sanga, Tawi Tawi Province The Balobok Rocksheiter, located at Sanga Sanga Island in Tawi Tawi Province, was first reported to the National Museum in 1966. Partial exca? vations of the site were undertaken in 1969 (Spoehr 1973) and in 1970 (Cabanilla &amp; Cabanilla 1992). A re-excavation of the site in 1992 was deemed necessary because "the earlier limited excavations in 1969 and in 1970 have generated limited, but intriguing, archaeological data the com? pleteness of which may be essential to Philippine, Southeast Asian and Pa? cific prehistory" (Ronquillo et al. 1993:1). The recovery from the site of polished shell adzes made from the giant clam Tridacna gigas, which date to as far back as 7,000 B.P. (before the present), is deemed significant to the identical, but later (ca. 2,000 B.P.) polished shell adzes found in the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands in southern Ryuku, as well as on numerous Pacific islands (Asato 1990). The Balobok Rocksheiter is a habitation site with three distinct cultural phases of occupation. The four radiocarbon dates generated in 1992 de? lineate the sequential chronology, which range from 6810 B.C. to 3190 B.C. The technology of manufacture of the polished adzes recovered at Balobok is inferred from the earlier flaking method observed in the recov? ered flaked shell and stone tools at the site. Shell blanks were initially flaked, using the percussion technique, and were later polished to achieve the desired shape and sharpness of the prehistoric adze. ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS The Philippine Constitution distinctly provides for the preservation and development of Filipino culture for national identity. The cave archae? ological resources of the country are protected by laws of the land, particu? larly by Republic Act No. 4846, otherwise known as "The Cultural</page><page sequence="7">144 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Properties Preservation and Protection Act," which declares that it is the policy of the state to preserve and protect the cultural properties of the na? tion. Its amendment, Presidential Decree No. 374, strengthens the original Act. Presidential Decree No. 260, and its amendment, P.D. 1492, declares as national shrines, and/or landmarks important places in the country, which include, among others, the petroglyphs of the Rocksheiter in An gono, Rizal, the petroglyphs of Alab, Bontoc, the Mummy Caves of Kabayan, Benguet and of Sagada and Alab, Bontoc, and the petroglyphs in the Cave at the Tau't Batu area in Barangay Ransang, Quezon, Palawan. Caves, rockshelters and overhangs declared by the National Museum as archaeological sites - "any place which may be underground, or on the surface, underwater, or at sea level which contains fossils, artifacts and other cultural, geological, botanical, zoological materials which depict and document evidence of paleontological and prehistoric events" - are easily the target of rampant destruction through illegal looting, guano collecting, treasure hunting for the 'famed' Yamashita gold, illegal stalactite gather? ing, and exploitation and decay due to ignorance, neglect or indifference. Treasure hunting activities for buried Japanese plundered "treasures", which has recently become a craze in the country, is legalized through Presidential Decree No. 1726-a and are enforced by a separate govern? ment office, notably the Presidential Security Group in Malacanang. This legalization of treasure hunting activities has done unparalleled damage to the country's archaeological cave sites. The indiscriminate diggings by the treasure hunters, without concern for the country's archaeological heritage found in cave sites, invariably destroy an important component of the country's non-renewable resources. Uncontrolled and illegal guano collecting inside caves and rockshelters also result in the destruction of important archaeological resources. The National Museum has an existing Memorandum of Agreement with the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences, which orders applications for guano extractions to be first referred to the National Museum. This, however, has only been implemented, mostly in the Visayas, in the 1980s. Since the en? actment of the Local Government Code, permits for guano collecting in caves are issued by the local governments.</page><page sequence="8">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL VALUES OF CAVES 145 POLICY AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS As products of and witness to past cultural achievements, the archae? ological heritage of the Philippines is significant, both to the country and as part and parcel of the world heritage. Adequate protection of these re? sources through improved enforcement of existing laws and regulations, proper linkages and networking among agencies involved in protecting the country's cultural heritage as well as the undertaking of feasible programs of information and awareness, both geared for the public and the law en? forcers, are necessary and essential courses of action. The archaeological heritage, unlike other cultural resources, is particu? larly fragile. Site destruction as a result of soil erosion, development pro? jects, illegal pot-hunting activities, and uncontrolled guano collecting, all contribute to the irreversible destruction and loss of the country's archae? ological resources in caves and rockshelters. The archaeological treasures of Philippine caves have important educa? tional, recreational, and tourism applications. Properly protected and man? aged, these archaeological sites may be developed and expanded into recreational and educational areas for the appreciation of students and tourists, local as well as foreign. The potentials of archaeological caves sites as recreational areas and tourist attractions are only now starting to be realized by the tourism industry and, when properly managed and pro? tected, may well be a good alternative source of needed currency for the country. A number of the caves noted above have been declared "National Treasures" because they possess "outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value which is significant and important to this country and nation." As such, they are protected by law from being destroyed. Un? fortunately, the enforcement of the laws on the protection and preservation of non-renewable archaeological resources still leaves much to be desired. As matters of policy and management the following are considered es? sential for the proper protection of the important, non-renewable, and frag? ile archaeological resources found in caves and rockshelters all over the country: 1. R.A. 4846 and its amendments P.D. 374, also known as "The Cul? tural Properties Preservation and Protection Act," need to be disseminated nationwide for their proper implementation. The adequate and effective</page><page sequence="9">146 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY protection of the country's non-renewable archaeological resources need to be appreciated and enforced specifically by the officials of the Local Gov? ernments, the members of registered Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), the public school teachers and students, the law enforcers of the land, and the numerous members of civic-oriented organizations, such as the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions and the local cultural and heritage foundations. The Department of Education, Culture and Sports, the Department of Tourism and the newly-created National Commission on Culture and the Arts could all contribute positively in this essential, important, and timely Archaeological Heritage Dissemination Project. 2. An Archaeological Tourism Program, designed to enhance the tour? ism potential of archaeological cave sites, may well be opportune through a networking between the National Museum and the Department of Tour? ism. As a combination of the past and the natural environment, Cave Ar? chaeological Sites are ideal for tourism and recreational purposes. The focus of this program may include the identification, formulation, market? ing and retailing of the past through relevant interpretation. That these sites be made accessible to and appreciated by the general public, without com? promising their intrinsic cultural value, should be considered one of the program's primary goals. 3. Applications for guano collecting inside caves and rockshelters should require the appropriate evaluation of and clearance from the Na? tional Museum prior to the issuance of permits by Local Governments for the extraction of the fertilizers for commercial purposes. In this way we may yet prevent the destruction of non-renewable archaeological resources in caves and rockshelters. 4. The protection and preservation of archaeological resources inside caves and rockshelters, which is incorporated in the Implementing Rules and Regulations for the National Integrated Protected Area System (NI PAS), recently enacted as R.A. No. 7586, and now being implemented by the DENR, requires close coordination with National Museum archaeolo? gists. As mandated in R.A. 4846 and P.D. 374 this is now complied within the conduct of any archaeological activities envisioned. 5. P.D. 1726-A now needs to be critically assessed, evaluated and, if so warranted, repealed. This Martial Law Decree is contradictory to RA 4846 and PD 374 and, therefore, is detrimental to the vital protection and preser? vation of the country's cultural resources. P.D. 1726-A provides blanket</page><page sequence="10">ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL VALUES OF CAVES 147 authority to search and dig indiscriminately in search for the Yamashita treasure and has already done unparalleled damage to cave archaeological resources all over the country. The historical period in the Philippines started only in the 16th century - or just over 400 years ago. This is a minuscule period of time consider? ing the 500,000 years prehistory of the country. The selective and incom? plete historical records can be enhanced through adequate archaeological research. The only way to explicate the prehistoric life ways of the prehis? toric Filipinos and to bring to light the lives of 25,000 past generations of our Filipino ancestors is through appropriate archaeological research and well-reasoned interpretation of the country's archaeological resources. Large numbers of these are found in caves and rockshelters. The unabated destruction of important and non-renewable archaeologi? cal sites in caves, rocksheiter and overhangs is unfortunate because these archaeological sites have recreational, educational and tourism potentials if properly tapped. The archaeological resources of the country have an in? trinsic qualitative value which lies in their ability to act as tangible sym? bols of past Philippine cultural communities and in their potential as a source of knowledge. The government, the private sector, civic-oriented groups, law enforcers and individuals need to shoulder a collective respon? sibility to protect and preserve the cave archaeological resources of the country to ensure their safety from pillage and wanton looting. A nation's cave archaeological resources are non-renewable wealth of the country and, as such, need to be adequately protected and managed. These resources are part of a country's history and national identity. It is but fitting to protect and preserve them for the appreciation and enrichment of the succeeding generations of Filipinos.
