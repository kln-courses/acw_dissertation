<plain_text><page sequence="1">IHE IDEOLOGY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND THE PRACTICE OF SELF- EXPERIMENTATION Stuart Walker Strickland In his 1960 novel, The Moviegoer, Walker Percy allows his soul- searching narrator to scribble the following proposal to himself: "Explore connection between romanticism and scientific objectivity. Does a scientifically minded person become a romantic because he is a left-over from his own science?"' The present essay is, in part, a response to Percy's query. It is an examination of the privileged yet pre- carious position of the self within the empirical sciences of the romantic era in Ger- many. The ideology of romantic science insisted upon the mutual implication of self- knowledge and knowledge of nature. As the geologist Henrich Steffens succinctly put it: "Do you want to know nature? Turn your glance inwards and you will be granted the privilege of beholding nature's stages of development in the stages of your spiri- tual education. Do you want to know yourself? Seek in nature: her works are those of the self-same spirit."2 Assertions of a perfect fit between an external natural environ- ment and an internal self had become increasingly common by the end of the eigh- teenth century.3 Comforting as Steffens' words may have been, such formulations consistently obscured at least two difficulties to which his contemporaries were far from blind. On the one hand, by portraying nature as a living creature whose visible history corresponds to the life-history of an individual, this ideology conflated knowl- edge of the body and knowledge of the self. On the other, it tended to exclude an essential third term: the communities within which self-knowledge and knowledge of nature each sought their place. The claim that knowledge of nature led directly to STUART WALKER STRICKLAND is Assistant Professor of History at North- western University.

This essay is thus embedded at once in a history of modern subjectiv- ity and in an analysis of how concerns about personal knowledge came to define the parameters of a distinctively scientific public sphere.4 To put it another way, I am asking why, at this critical moment in the "structural transformation of the public sphere," the self became an issue within science-and how, within a discourse ostensibly devoted to nature, attention to the self of the scientist helped shape a new conception of individu- ality.s I want to begin to unpack the romantic ideology of self-knowledge first by con- sidering the peculiarities of locating the self within the body of the experimenter, a body conceived at once as a laboratory instrument, a metaphor for nature, and a sign of the experimenter's individual identity. Historicizing the relationship between the self and the body of the natural philosopher also requires scrutiny of the tensions between soli- tude and community at the turn of the last century.6 Those who experimented on their own bodies did so at great personal expense and often under intensely private condi- tions. Their withdrawal into an internal world may appear to have been an attempt to escape from the political and intellectual turmoil that accompanied the Napoleonic Wars and the demands of an emergent public sphere, but these retreats also presup- posed an eventual return to a historically specific community whose reservations about personal knowledge were well known and often ambivalently shared by those who fled.7 It is thus essential that our study of self-knowledge attend to the difficulties antici- pated and encountered in trying to convey knowledge rooted in a particular body to a scientific community that was, for ideological reasons of its own, coming increasingly to esteem general over particular truths. My focus here will be on the work of Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776- 1810), the leading experimentalist and most dogged self-investigator of the romantic era.8 Both his commitment to the ideology that bound self-knowledge to knowledge of nature and his occasional insights into the difficulties inherent in maintaining this commitment make him an exemplary figure. To comprehend Ritter's use of his own body as an instrument, a source of knowledge, and an emblem of his individuality, we will have to consider the experiments to which he subjected himself within the con- text of the relationships he enjoyed with the multitude of other objects that populated his laboratory. If the body of the experimenter was a physical instantiation of his self, it was also an object among others. And if self-experimentation was an objectification of the self, most of Ritter's other investigations involved such a remarkable degree of sympathetic and anthropomorphic projection that his laboratory often seems to have become a forum in which prevailing social relations were reproduced. To open an experimental treatise of the romantic period is to stumble into a laboratory littered with animal parts, metal rods, and shards of glass, with objects depicted as passive registering devices and with others treated as subjects in their own right, themselves capable of directing the course of the investigation. Ritter frequently cast his relationship with nature's laboratory representatives in amorous terms. "In the spring," he wrote in February 1806, "I will return once more con 454</page><page sequence="3">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge amore to my dear frogs, from whom I still have much to learn."9 But the relationships between these objects and the human experimenter were far from stable and Ritter felt just as comfortable referring to his dear frogs as "Froschenapparat." The bound- ary between inert tools for interrogating nature and animated partners in a common project was constantly shifting. At times this boundary may seem to have lain neatly along the line separating the inorganic from the organic, as when an experimenter applied zinc and silver rods to elicit a twitch from the severed limb of a freshly killed frog. And yet, the frog's leg-and even the experimenter's own body-could also be represented as a "most sensitive electroscope," a purely passive device for detecting the presence or measuring the effects of electricity.10 The leading figure in this drama was the voltaic column, a tall and unmistakably phallic instrument invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800, a handsome piece of laboratory furniture composed of often hundreds of alternating layers of silver coins, disks of zinc, and moist paper, a primitive battery whose leads delivered powerful electric shocks to anything from the leaves of a sensitive plant to the experimenter's own genitals.11 On the eve of the construction of an enormous voltaic column consisting of 600 alternating pairs of metal disks, Ritter wrote to his pub- lisher: "Tomorrow I marry, i.e., my battery."12 His connubial anticipation hints at a deep ambiguity in the social life of the laboratory: the battery is Ritter's instrument, but it is also his partner. It is his private collaborator; but it is also a gift from his patron, conditional on the performance of public demonstrations. The voltaic column was, in fact, a remarkably versatile instrument. Applied to contract the muscles of a dissected frog or to animate the tongue of a bull or decapitated criminal, the battery pointed to the electrical basis of life; used to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, the battery demonstrated that electricity was a chemical process; probing the deepest recesses of the human body, the battery established the common electrical responses of our sense organs, or, less ambitiously, offered a treatment for deafness and a remedy for melancholia.13 But the battery itself was also a body whose behavior varied with the seasons of the year, with the passage from day to night, and with fluctuations in barometric pressure. Like the human body, the voltaic column was a microcosm: "For everything in nature appears to be joined through one chain [Kette], of which the voltaic column is only a fortunate member."14 All of life, and indeed the whole of nature, could be conceived as an elaborate system of voltaic columns. Like the human body, the voltaic column had a pulse whose cycles reproduced the oscilla- tions of the heavens. Nature was one colossal living battery. More than a mere instru- ment, the battery, though composed entirely of inorganic material, was itself a living being, a limb of nature, conveniently located in the laboratory to reveal the periodic spasms that sustained the cosmic organism. If these texts seem cluttered, the laboratory itself could be down- right disorienting, particularly if it were the laboratory of someone like Ritter, a man who lived amidst the refuse of his own work and scarcely acknowledged any bound- ary between his personal and experimental life, a man whose own body had become his favorite instrument. Visiting Ritter's apartment in Munich at the end of 1809, Karl von Raumer recoiled at its material disarray which, for him, signified spiritual chaos and the degeneration of a great mind: 455</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 31 / 4 I came upon Ritter in a vile and dismal room in which everything possible: books, instruments, wine bottles-lay indiscriminately about. He himself was in an indescribably agitated state, full of sullen hos- tility. One after another he guzzled wine, coffee, beer, and every sort of drink, as though he were trying to extinguish a fire inside of him .... I felt the deepest sympathy to see this once so gifted man in such torment, in such bodily and mental suffering.1s In the winter of 1809, Ritter had gradually withdrawn from the world, confining himself first to his house, then to his room, and finally to his sweat-soaked bed. Alone in a two-room apartment, surrounded by the remnants of an experimental life, suffer- ing from an illness brought on by a lifetime of brutal self-experiments, he felt himself forsaken by colleagues and friends. Within a month of Raumer's visit Ritter was dead at the age of thirty-three. Ritter's rise to prominence within the German scientific community had been as rapid as his demise. As a twenty-year-old student in Jena, he had already attracted the attention of Alexander von Humboldt, who was then putting the finish- ing touches on his comprehensive two-volume study of galvanism or animal electric- ity. Ritter had been recommended to Humboldt as a young man, "who occupied him- self relentlessly with galvanic experiments and combined a fundamental chemical knowledge with true observational genius."''16 Humboldt was sufficiently impressed with Ritter to take him under his wing and enlist him to write a critical postscript to his work, to "go through my writing with critical severity and point out to me where I had erred or expressed myself too one-sidedly."17 The following year, Ritter pub- lished his own treatise on galvanism, earning the recognition not only of the leading figures of German science, but also of Goethe, Schiller, Novalis, Schelling, and Friedrich Schlegel.18 Ritter quickly became the most prolific contributor to the leading experi- mental journal in Germany, Ludwig Gilbert's Annalen der Physik. By 1801, he had announced his discovery of ultraviolet light, following Herschel's discovery of infra- red light at the other end of the spectrum.19 When his invention of an accumulator, a column of alternating copper and paper disks capable of storing the electricity of the voltaic column, brought him into conflict with Volta, Gilbert took Ritter's side, assur- ing Volta that, "Ritter is a most scrupulous and precise observer and I am convinced that what he reports has also been observed by him."20 But it was Ritter's self-experimentation and his unremitting pursuit of the correlation between self-knowledge and knowledge of nature that most distin- guished his career. Reviewing Ritter's posthumously published Fragments from the Literary Estate of a Young Physicist in 1810, Achim von Arnim declared that "never has a physicist experimented so recklessly with his own body."21 Although he hailed Ritter as a "martyr for science," Arnim criticized him for failing to show proper rev- erence for his body as "God's image."22 He questioned the sense of Ritter's self-sacri- fice, expressed doubt that his or any other self-experiments had ever resulted in any significant discovery, and advised young researchers, among whom he feared the prac- tice of self-experimentation would become a fashion, to prove their courage and com- mitment by other means.23 456</page><page sequence="5">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge Electrical self-experimentation already had a distinguished history by the end of the eighteenth century. As early as 1767, twenty-four years before Luigi Galvani would draw attention to the phenomenon he called animal electricity, Johann George Sulzer had noted the unpleasant taste produced by touching lead and silver to his tongue. In his Investigations into the causes of pleasurable and unpleasurable sen- sations, Sulzer set the terms by which the human body would be understood among subsequent experimenters. He considered the human body a part of nature, a Werkzeug, a tool or an instrument: All works of nature, from the stone to man, are equally tools, which the creator of nature uses for the realization of his intentions. In vain would our pride exclude itself from this general destiny of all finite being; even against our will, countless cases teach us and events re- veal that we, with all our genius, all our insight and cultivated poli- tics, are only a tool, and almost only a blind tool, of a higher power that we would only elude in vain.24 Electrical self-experimenters of the eighteenth century easily translated the notion that their bodies were instruments of the Lord into a conception of their bodies as labora- tory instruments. In his History of Galvanism, J. B. Trommsdorff recounted the ex- periments of Franz Karl Achard, who connected his mouth and anus in a galvanic circuit of silver and zinc, resulting in "increased activity of the stomach, pain in the abdomen, and changes in the faeces."25 Alexander von Humboldt used blistering plas- ters to create a pair of open wounds on the back of his shoulders in 1795 in order to join his frogs in a galvanic circuit.26 By and large, these men treated their bodies much as they did the other objects in their laboratories: They abused them with little reflec- tion on their status as conscious beings. Ritter's own electrical self-experimentation began innocently enough. In his 1798 treatise on galvanism, he used his tongue as an instrument to detect the continuous action of a galvanic circuit, to show that the reaction of the frog's muscle, something only visible as muscular contraction at the moment when the circuit was closed or opened, was actually a continuous process that remained in effect so long as he remained closed within the circuit.27 But the invention of the voltaic column, and the analogy developed between the column and the human body, opened up new possibili- ties for more revealing, more suggestive, and more dangerous experiments. At once the voltaic column created phenomena so striking that anyone could have at least some experience of them. "Close a voltaic column, e.g. of 100 layers, built with ammonium chloride, through your body," Ritter entreated his readers. "You will get a jolt."28 Throughout the first decade of the nineteenth century, Ritter system- atically applied the voltaic column to all of his sense organs. He used the battery to produce tones in his ears, colors in his eyes, heat and cold in his fingertips, and to induce fits of sneezing. Nor did Ritter neglect the pains and pleasures the battery brought to the lower extremities of his body. He published experiments on the influence of galvanism on the "organs of reproduction," on his pulse, and on "the organs of evacuation" as well as "other choice parts of the body."29 He sat, often for hours, in the circuit before 457</page><page sequence="6">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 31 / 4 taking a break to reverse the poles of his battery and compare the effects. His initial goal in these investigations had been to establish electrical stimulation as the common basis of all sensation: "The same thing that produces colors in the eye, produces tones in the ear,-as though colors were mute tones, and tones, in turn, speaking colors.-That may well seem to be only a manner of speaking, but it could be more than one may have allowed oneself to believe."30 In each of these experiments, the body had become more than an instrument. The phenomena under investigation now resided within the body of the experimenter. The electrical experiments provided evidence for an invisible ground that would unite the apparently distinct human functions and senses, proving that the body-and perhaps, by extension, the self-was an integrated whole. But the knowledge Ritter gained about his body made that body, in turn, all the more effective and persuasive as an instrument for investigating the proper- ties of the voltaic column and for comparing its effects with those produced by other means. Ritter used the knowledge he had gained about his body's response to the voltaic column to compare the column with an instrument of his own creation, an accumulator [Ladungssiiule] he claimed could store the electricity of Volta's column just as the Ley- den jar stored electricity produced by friction. Ritter claimed that his body responded to the accumulator just as it responded to the direct application of Volta's column: If, instead of one of the two hands, one brings an eye, an ear, the nose, the tongue, or another part of the body into the closed circuit, one has in each of these organs the same feelings [Empfindungen] that Volta's battery itself is wont to give, i.e. on the side of the end of A [Ritter's instrument] that was [bound] with the +pole of the voltaic [column], in the eye: increased influence of light, bluish color, dimi- nution of objects, narrower than usual field of vision; in the ear: sound with a deeper tone than g; in the nose: suppression of scent as with acide muriatique oxygene; on the tongue: acidic taste; and finally in all of these, as in every other part of the body, expansion. On the side of the end of A, however, which was bound with the -pole of the voltaic battery, one has, in the eye: diminished influence of light, redish color, and wider than usual field of vision; in the ear: sound with a higher tone than g; in the nose: impulse to sneeze; on the tongue: alkaline taste; and finally the general feeling [Empfindung] in all of these, as in every other part of the body: contraction.31 Here Ritter's body had become an instrument for comparing the effects of his accu- mulator with those of Volta's battery. The accumulator, rather than the body, was the object under investigation and, because Ritter had calibrated his own body to the voltaic column, even though he admitted that the individual impressions-for ex- ample, the tones he heard when one lead of the voltaic column resided in his ear- might differ from those experienced by others, the effect was to create a preponder- ance of evidence to support his claim that the accumulator contained the electricity produced by Volta's battery.32 Not content to have cataloged the responses of his body to the bat- tery, Ritter sought the boundaries of its effects. He constructed larger and larger vol- taic columns in order to determine whether there was any limit to the current he could generate or endure. "Since one can only perform them on oneself," Ritter acknowl- 458</page><page sequence="7">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge edged, "these experiments are somewhat painful, and for that reason I have so far only been able to properly treat three of the senses."33 Nevertheless, Ritter persevered, noting the changes he experienced and his body underwent as he gradually increased the size of the column in which he bound himself: I abide with my eye on the positive pole of a rather powerful column of 100, 150, or 200 layers, thoroughly lubricate the hand that closes the circuit with saline or ammonium chloride solution, sheath it well with metal and now I close, first with only a few layers, then with progressively more, until finally the whole column is in the circuit. In the beginning I have the same blue as usual; it grows stronger the further I go; but finally it stands still, darkens, a mixed color of a greenish sort emerges, though not so distinctly green as the previous light was blue; then it develops into yellow, etc., until finally it is the most glorious red and of an intensity that I have never seen before, even on the negative pole.34 Ritter has done nothing in this rendering to mitigate the impression that these experi- ences were his own or that the ordeal he has recounted was anything more or less than his own personal odyssey. None too subtle in his eroticization of this adventure, Ritter neither resorts to the passive voice nor invokes the impersonal pronoun. Knowing that his readers were unlikely to repeat these experiments themselves, Ritter has con- structed a first-person account that instead draws them into his experience, a kind of travel narrative that describes only cursorily the details that would facilitate repeti- tion and depends not on the reference of any particular experience, but on creating the impression of a journey farther and farther up the column, farther away from the reader's own experience and deeper into Ritter's own body. However much he increased the size of the voltaic column, Ritter found no limit to its effect and speculated that the only boundary lay in the experimenter's capacity for or willingness to endure pain. In fact, the experiments seem to have offered him the chance to prove just how far he himself was willing to go. Of these particular experiments, he boasted: "These trials are difficult and take a great deal of self-control since the eye suffers greatly thereby; but I have not shrunk from thoroughly assuring myself of the invariability of their results through frequent repetition."3s Ritter was proud to have pursued these experiments as far as he had and rarely passed up the opportunity to point out that he had ventured far beyond the limits anyone else had dared to cross. In recounting experiments he performed by pinning his eyelid open and starring into the sun, Ritter explicitly compared himself with Erasmus Darwin, who had "only looked into the sun until it appeared light blue to him. After the first few minutes, it looked so to me as well, but after 15 to 20 minutes it had frequently become completely yellow."36 Even before this eye had recovered, Ritter subjected his other eye to the same experiment: "Through looking into the sun for 20 minutes, I have gone so far that for 26 days (until today) I have in each eye a place which has no more sense for black and white, and which see colors reversed: red, blue and blue, yellow or red.""37 In a competitive intellectual environment, the extent of Ritter's self-experimentation dis- tinguished him from his rivals. It gave him access to experiences they had not been able to observe. It became the basis of his personal and intellectual authority and a testament to his character and personal dedication. 459</page><page sequence="8">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 31 / 4 Ritter investigated his own body first to establish a common basis of sensation; he then used his body as a calibrated instrument to show that different sources of electricity produced similar results; finally, he used the self-experiments to distinguish himself from his peers, to mark himself as a superior source of knowledge. In the first instance, the battery was applied as an instrument to the organs of the body whose specific characteristics were under scrutiny. In the second case, one could say that he alienated himself from his body so that it could become a passive registering device for comparing phenomena produced by other instruments, by instruments which them- selves represented a microcosm of nature. In the third case, Ritter brought back heroic stories from the laboratory, stories in which his body once again represented his self. The body endured the pain that distinguished the experimenter as an individual and allowed him almost exclusive access to experiences for which he alone could vouch.38 As much as these experiments were a test of and a testament to Ritter's personal courage, he occasionally had to admit that even he had had to abort experiments where, in addition to immediate pain, he experienced long-term damage to his senses: "It is a shame that these otherwise quite interesting experiments are so inexorably accompanied by disagreeable consequences for the health of the experi- menter as to set obstinate limits to them.""39 The long- and short-term health hazards of electrical self-experimentation were well-known to Ritter and to his contemporar- ies. Even before Ritter had conducted his most heroic experiments, Trommsdorff counted among the likely consequences "inflammation of the eyes, diminished sensi- tivity of the tongue, catarrh and vertigo accompanied by headaches."40 He noted that Ritter's suffering had already been extreme, that, having sat for an hour in a circuit with a battery capable of sending a shock from the fingertips to the shoulder, he had lost some use of one arm and, "a shudder befell him and a languor and dullness in all his limbs" that lasted over a week and forced him "to take refuge in serious rem- edies."41 That was in 1803. By the end of his life, six years later, it had become diffi- cult to distinguish between the symptoms Ritter suffered as a direct result of his self- experimentation and those that followed from the doses of opium and alcohol he regularly consumed to ward off the pain.42 Ritter had long recognized that the risks involved in self-experimentation would make it unlikely that others would repeat his experiments, share his experiences, or be able to confirm his results. But beyond the physical self-sacrifice that made repetition a rare occurrence lay deeper philosophical concerns about the relationship between general truths and personal knowledge. On several occasions, he explicitly addressed the problem of how to represent his own experiences in a way that would nevertheless allow them to find a place in a commu- nally shared body of knowledge. Acknowledging that "Everything is too subjective for me to expect anyone to take it as true at first glance," and aware that he was conveying observa- tions "whose successful repetition I may count on even less than on any I have previ- ously been compelled to make," Ritter appealed to his readers' aesthetic sensibility. He hoped for readers who would recognize the harmony of the whole of the experi- ences he described. It would be impossible, he claimed, for him to recount all of the particulars of his experiments in sufficient detail that they could be repeated by some- one who lacked the tacit knowledge he alone had acquired through constant practice, 460</page><page sequence="9">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge even if that person were prepared to take the risks that he had. Even those details he had provided would, he feared, appear to many as so many "trifles, hardly worth the effort one must expend on them." For those who focused only on the "dead letter" of his descriptions, these would remain mere curiosities and might, he contended, just as well have been fabricated. But none of these minutia were insignificant, he insisted, for "in this realm everything is equally large and each signification infinite." Ritter was driven by the hope and the faith that he would find a few readers with the aes- thetic sensibility to recognize the truth in the "lively accord of the harmony" of the whole, even if they did not themselves share his experience.43 This appeal to an aesthetic appreciation of the whole that would overcome the unfamiliarity and subjectivity of the particulars, echoes the plea of Karl Philip Moritz to the readers of Anton Reiser in 1786: Whoever values such a faithful representation will not object to that which is initially insignificant or appears unimportant, but will take into consideration that this artfully woven web of human life consists of an infinite number of trifles that all become extremely important in their interweaving, however insignificant they appear in themselves.- Whoever becomes attentive to his past life often believes at first that he sees nothing but aimlessness, broken threads, confusion, night and darkness; but the more he fixes his view upon it, the more the darkness disappears, the aimlessness gradually subsides, the broken threads join themselves back together, the things confused and piled upon one another order themselves-and the dissonance resolves it- self unnoticed into harmony and euphony.44 The chronicler of experiments performed on his own body and the author of the first "psychological novel" held the same expectations of their readers. Even if the particu- lar experiences narrated were never to be repeated, even if they remained unique to the individual, the truth of the whole could be recognized, if not by all, at least by those who reflected on the course of their own unique experience. In each case, the individual experiences retain their subjective character. Yet the whole into which they are woven aspires to a harmony that would assure their truth. The textual representation of self-experimentation stood in stark contrast to the public demonstrations of galvanic phenomena that were drawing large crowds by the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was not enough simply to see the experiments Ritter performed on himself, not only because the effects he described were seldom externally visible, but because the whole could only be grasped histori- cally. Responding to Goethe's request for advice in the construction of a physical cabinet, Ritter reflected on his own experience as a public lecturer. In the salon and the classroom, Ritter had experienced both the necessity and the inadequacy of theo- ries that "bring order to the representation" by concealing their own transience. The "self-contained representation" of the public lecture might be persuasive and reveal- ing, but, by creating the illusion of completeness, it shut out the historical nature of its subject, consigning it to remain "the secret business of the teacher."4s 461</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 31 / 4 Ritter seldom distinguished the historical representation of experi- ments from the life-history of the experimenter. Describing the serial publication of his own experiments, he insisted that, "It should not merely be a collection of my writings; it will be a kind of literary autobiography, of interest perhaps to anyone who wants or has to educate himself to become a physicist and experimenter."46 If these works constituted a literary autobiography, then the history within which Ritter's otherwise inaccessible experiences were embedded became indistinguishable from the life-history of the experimenter. The historical emplotment of experimental science and the life-history of the experimenter were one, and self-experimentation became a form of autobiography. Both Ritter and Moritz wrote for an audience that had be- come increasingly leery of idiosyncratic or personal knowledge. The disputes that raged during the first decade of the nineteenth century over efforts to raise medicine to the status of a science reveal some of the stakes in denying a place to individuality within scientific discourse. Critics of reformers who sought to unify medical knowl- edge within a comprehensive system were vociferous in their indictment of all theo- retical knowledge as rooted in the conceit of the individual theorist. Proponents of these new philosophical systems saw their own efforts, in turn, as a means to preclude the kind of virtuosity they associated with knowledge based on medical case histories. Both the appeal to the baldest empiricism and the articulation of the most abstract philosophies of nature were conditioned by efforts to deny any space for personal knowledge within the domain of scientific medicine. A. F. Hecker characterized the philosophical idealism he detected behind recent attempts to systematize medical knowledge as self-indulgent, "since speculation remains eternally bound to the individuality of the speculator."47 In his view, Schelling's philosophy of nature had encouraged the cultivation of knowledge specific to the individual: "Since the I's of the wordmongering philosophers are com- pletely different I's, we obtain from these reflections of knowledge upon knowledge new contradictions with each passing day and things are pronounced and proposed by philosophizing reason today that will no longer be allowed to be pronounced or proposed tomorrow."48 Medical theory remained an arbitrary human artifact, divorced from common experience, ephemeral, and too narrowly located to provide the basis for the accumulation of collective experience. Only that which could be commonly observed could provide the ground for a consensus capable of outlasting personal disputes and providing a source of stability in the face of the rapid change that char- acterized the intellectual milieu of Napoleonic Europe. Hecker sought knowledge that would last. By the first decade of the nineteenth century, philosophers of nature had come to share Hecker's aversion to knowledge rooted in an individual, even as they persevered in the construction of theories that seldom outlived their creators. For Schelling, who was particularly promiscuous in his allegiance to and disavowal of the systems he authored, philosophical reflection offered an escape from the limitations of individuality and an opportunity to lose oneself in the vastness of the Absolute. In the editor's preface to his Jahrbiicher fiir die Medicine als Wissenschaft, Schelling declared his willingness to sacrifice all that was rooted in individuality: 462</page><page sequence="11">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge We acknowledge that the most glorious in human nature is that which we call originality [Ursprunglichkeit oder Originalitiit]; indeed that is its reflection of God! But this originality is for that very reason completely different from personality; it is no peculiarity of the spirit that man would seek to achieve out of vanity, for everyone who seeks to be free in this way is in just this way a slave. Only God is able to create the particularity of things and this is the sign of godliness in them. Thus only what is touched by God can truly be particular, but not the selfish man who, forsaken by nature and God, can create nothing, but only assemble and combine.49 Neither among the philosophical idealists, whose vision of nature Ritter shared, nor among the empiricists, whose methods he followed, could the self-experimenter ex- pect to find an audience for what was peculiar to himself in his work. There is a democratic edge to these critiques of personal knowl- edge. Hegel conceded that the kind of philosophical artistry Hecker despised had forsaken the interest of the people in order to indulge itself; philosophers "brought help to themselves by means of reflection, and have found their satisfaction in fini- tude, in subjectivity and its virtuosity, and consequently in what is empty and vain, but the substantial kernel of the people cannot find its satisfaction here."50 Likewise, Hecker could not tolerate "speculation in a self-created ideal world" since "it raises itself above the common viewpoint of the practical man."51 If medical reformers and their adversaries shared one thing, it was their conviction that the peculiarities of the individual posed a threat to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge and led to the abandonment of the interests of a larger community. Beyond these disputes over the science of medicine, by the turn of the century experimental science as a whole-and especially the galvanic sciences in which German researchers excelled-had come to be seen as a means for transcend- ing the political conflict of the Napoleonic Wars and for shoring up tensions between French and German researchers in the aftermath of their long and bitter dispute over Lavoisier's new chemistry. Amidst the rancor that lingered from the struggle over the new chemistry, galvanism provided an opportunity to heal the wounds of the immedi- ate past. It allowed J. Schaub, editor of the Archiv far die Pharmacie und iirztliche Naturkunde, to reassert the international character of science with the otherwise hardly credible claim-especially in light of the nationalistic overtones of the campaign against the "French chemistry"-that the sciences were a place where, in contrast to the gen- eral discord of the age, a common spirit prevailed: At no time has a greater spirit of research, a more noble endeavor towards useful discoveries, a more inexhaustible thirst for science, a more selfless generosity in the publication of penetrating observa- tions and generally beneficial experiences prevailed among the vari- ous nations-and especially among the Germans-than in the present age. Indeed, it appears that only one common spirit prevails among the scholars and artists of all the cultivated European nations-in order to raise science, art and trades of every sort to their highest dignity on the wings of culture-which even the pressure of an al- 463</page><page sequence="12">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 31 / 4 most general war under which otherwise everything suffers, the po- litical differences of the nations, is not able to offset. English, French, Germans in northern and southern provinces, and other peoples mu- tually exchange their useful discoveries to the benefit of mankind.52 Any appeal to the particular, to the subjective nature of personal knowledge, could only appear as a threat to the ideological work in which many in the German scien- tific and philosophical communities saw themselves engaged. Jerome McGann has identified this strategy as characteristic of ro- mantic uses of the idea of nature in the face of social turmoil: "In moments of crisis the Romantic will turn to Nature or to the creative Imagination as his places of last resort. Amidst the tottering structures of early nineteenth-century Europe, poetry as- serted the integrity of the biosphere and the inner, spiritual self, both of which were believed to transcend the age's troubling doctrinal conflicts and ideological shifts."53 But this was a strategy pursued not only by those we would characterize as romantic. Hecker's anxiety about the succession of theories of nature led him to develop a strat- egy for arresting history or at least establishing the cumulative nature of the develop- ment of science. Both speculative idealists and empirical researchers responded to the disarray and instability of their time in a way that denied the particular and excluded the subjective. Within this context, there could be little hope of finding a place for what was unique about an individual researcher's experience. If Ritter were to avoid becoming "a left-over from his own science," his route would have to be indirect. And thus it was from this world that Ritter's self fled in search of experiences that would allow his body to reenter. "As a physicist," Ritter observed, "one is a doubled nature."54 By this he appears to have meant both that the physicist is a copy of nature and that the self of the physicist is divided: it is both a physical and a spiritual being. Furthermore, as a physicist, Ritter faced in two directions: he was engaged, on the one hand, in a private conversation with nature, and, on the other, in a public discussion with his peers: Man is nothing else now than that he is never complete, as are his speeches, and they remain so, however often and however better he repeats them. But complete and completely free of error is his god- dess Nature. It appears to me downright dangerous that he confess, before she could forgive him. And when I am engaged in experimen- tation, then I am truly more honest and more corrigible than often among you, my friends. For you are not yet nature.55 In his self-experiments, Ritter withdrew from the incomplete and discordant forces of a contested and partial public realm within which his own experiences could only appear particular and unique. He sought refuge in another world, one within which his personal experiences could be perfectly integrated into a harmonious whole. But he could not forget the world from which he had fled. In fact, it was in an effort to find a place for himself within that world that he had initially embarked upon his journey. When under the spell of his own senses, Ritter had the 464</page><page sequence="13">STRICKLAND / The Ideology of Self-Knowledge impression of being lost to the social world. But it is this experience of abandonment that Ritter invokes in an effort to make the experiences he relates comprehensible to his audience: I know something that makes the point clear. It is an observation that I have often made while listening to a good song, and it is per- haps not unfamiliar to others. A tone that is sung exquisitely clearly and held for a long time is often only conspicuous and audible to the external ear as a tone for the first moment, then it ceases to be heard; but one continues most animatedly to feel and delight in it with all possible intimacy and magnitude; it is as if one were this tone oneself; its essence and our own are one, and utterly nothing of it remains external. The singer pauses; one is startled, feels himself forsaken by the beautiful company, only now does one know again that some- thing must have been there for the ear, the imagination reflects, but reality offers nothing: in short, one has really heard nothing more- and yet more than ever.s6 Whether self-experimenters like Ritter became romantics because they were "left- overs" from their own science, whether they sacrificed their selves in hope of finding a place at least for their bodies within a community from which they felt personally estranged, or whether they sacrificed their bodies in order to create a narrative of their selves, their projects shared at least this much with that of those who sought to exclude personal experience from the domain of scientific knowledge: they sought a ground of common understanding, of recognition, a means for making their experi- ence of individuality something more than simply their own. Without denying the value of communicable knowledge epitomized in the scientific public sphere, they balked at its considerable cost as they were forced to confront audiences no longer fully convinced of the commensurability of self-knowledge and knowledge of nature. The dilemmas faced and imperfect solutions conceived by self-experimenters were thus integral both to the construction of modern subjectivity and to the creation of a public sphere for science-and it is through the residue of their experiences that these two transformations can be understood as bound together.

In welcher Periode lebt gegenwartig die Menschheit?- Ist sie noch Kind, oder Jiingling,-Vater, Mutter?-oder so weiter." 4. In the first instance, my approach complements the efforts of Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison to write a conceptual history of objectivity. Cf. Daston and Galison, "The Image of Objectivity," Represen- tations 40 (Fall 1992): 81-128. As they point out, "Objectivity is related to subjectivity as wax to seal, as hollow imprint to the bolder and more solid features of subjectivity." (ibid., 82). Believing, however, that a history of subjectivity must be cultural as well as conceptual in its scope, I am encouraged by recent scholarship emphasizing the integral role of late eighteenth-century science in the formation of a public culture. Cf. Barbara Stafford, Artful Science: Enlightenment Entertainment and the Eclipse of Visual Education (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994) and Jan Golinski, Science as Public Culture: Chemistry and Enlightenment in Britain, 1760-1820 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992). And yet, remark- ably little work has been done to situate the formation of a scientific public sphere in relation to the literary and political public spheres that occupied Habermas' attention in his Strukturwandel der Offentlichkeit (Darmstadt and Neuwied: Hermann Luchterhand Verlag, 1962). David Zaret has taken Habermas himself to task for failing to appreciate the centrality of science, contending that "experimental science was clearly the most important for reshaping the more general views of reason and public opinion that made plausible the liberal model of the public sphere." Cf. Zaret, "Religion, Science, and Printing in the Public Spheres of Seventeenth-Century England," in Craig Calhoun, ed., Habermas and the Public Sphere (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 212-35, 227. In spite of a surge of interest in Habermas' account among English-speaking historians, the pivotal role of science remains to be examined. 5. I want to take seriously Michel Foucault's claim that the knower of nature became paradigmatic of the modern subject. Cf. Foucault, The Birth of the Clinic (New York: Vintage, 1973), esp. 197. While a consensus has emerged that a distinctly modern idea of individuality began to be articulated at the end of the eighteenth century, recent efforts to historicize our conception of the self have focused exclusively on literary and philosophical texts. Cf. Gerald N. Izenberg, Impossible Individuality: Romanticism, Revolution, and the Origins of Modern Selfhood, 1787-1802 (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1992); John O. Lyons, The Invention of the Self: The Hinge of Consciousness in the Eighteenth Century (Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1978); Charles Taylor, Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1989); and Mark C. Taylor, Journeys to Selfhood: Hegel and Kierkegaard (Berke- ley: Univ. of California Press, 1980). Mario Biagioli's recent study of Galileo's "self-fashioning" as a court philosopher remains a story of professional rather than personal identity. Biagioli, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1993). 6. Steven Shapin treats the trope of solitude as transcendent rather than historically bounded. Cf. Shapin, "'The Mind in Its Own Place': Science and Solitude in 17th-century England," Science in Context 4 (1991). The popularity of works such as Johann Georg Zimmermann's Ueber die Einsamkeit (Leipzig: Weidmanns Erben und Reich, 1784-85), Friedrich Schleiermacher's Monologen (Berlin: C. S. Spener, 1800), and Christian Garve's Ueber Gesellschaft und Einsamkeit (Breslau: Wilhelm Gottlieb Korn, 1797-1800) suggests, however, a general reevalution of relationships between solitude and community in this period. 7.

The rhetoric of heroism deployed in this instance is but one indication of how deeply the seven- teenth-century moral economy of trust within which Robert Boyle had established his credibility as a Christian gentleman "who could speak for empirical realities inaccessible to other practitioners" had been transformed by the end of the eighteenth century. While the extension of trust remained an essential element of experimental culture, the basis for securing that trust now depended less on gentlemanly virtue than on the performance and narration of heroic feats.

Ja es scheint nur ein Gemeingeist unter den Gelehrten und Kiinstlern aller europaischen gebildeten Nationen zu herrschen-um die Wissenschaften, Kiinste und Gewerbe aller Art, bis zu ihrer hochsten Wiirde auf den Fliigel der Kultur zu erheben-die selbst der Druck eines fast allgemeinen Kriegs, unter dem sonst alles leidet, die Verschiedenheit der Politik der Nationen, nicht aufzuhaben vermochte.

Vollkommen aber u. ganz ohne Fehler ist seine Gottin die Natur. Es scheint mir ordentlich gefahrlich, dass er beichte, ehe sie ihm vergeben konne.

"Ich weif etwas, das die Sache klar macht. Es ist eine Bemerkung, die ich beym Horen eines guten Gesanges sehr oft gemacht habe, und die Andern auch vielleicht nicht fremd ist. Ein Ton, der vorziiglich rein gesungen, und lange ausgehalten wird, ist oft nur fiir die ersten Augenblicke dem aufieren Ohr als Ton auffallend und horbar, dann hort er auf gehort zu werden; man fuhlt und lebt ihn aber mit aller moglichen Innigkeit und Grofie auf das Lebendigste fort; es ist, als ware man dieser Ton selbst; sein Wesen und das unsrige sind eins, und schlechterdings nichts ist mehr aufBerlich an ihm. Die Sangerin halt inne; man schrickt auf, fiihlt sich verlassen von der schonen Gesellschaft, nun erst weif8 man wieder, dalf etwas da seyn mufte fiirs Ohr, die Phantasie dichtet, aber die Wirklichkeit giebt nichts: kurz, man hat wirklich nichts mehr gehort-und doch mehr als je." 471</page></plain_text>
