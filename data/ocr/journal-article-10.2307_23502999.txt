<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM MAX WIENER, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, O. THE attitude of English Puritanism toward Judaism and the Old Testament was, on the whole, sympathetic and friendly. But, in the thinking of the eighteenth century, particularly in Deism, this attitude became substantially altered. That "the idol of the Puritans was naturally the bugbear of the deists"1 can hardly be gainsaid. Matthew Tindal, James Foster, Thomas Morgan, Thomas Paine, and the third Lord of Shaftesbury are the names with which this disparagement of Jewish origins can be associated, the critique which identified the entire history of religion with superstition, barbarity, depravity, and coarseness naturally using the Old Testament as an arsenal.2 In this regard, there existed no discernible difference between those Englishmen and Voltaire. John Toland, well known in the history of Deism for his book Christianity Christianity not Mysterious (1696), constitutes a notable excep tion.tion. Claiming to be a follower of Locke, he assayed to interpret Christian dogma according to the principles of empiricism. Nor was he deterred by the fact that not only the orthodox theo logians but even Locke himself deemed this insufferably radical. Logical analysis, however, was only one of Toland's weapons. Another of his implements was historical research, and the phil ology of the Old and the New Testaments yet another. These were disciplines of which Toland expected the clearing of the path for a "rational" mode of approach. Among the non-theo logians of his time, Toland was accordingly one of the first to subject the Biblical text to a thorough study. While Hebrew as well as Arabic may, at that period, have figured in the educa 1 Leslie Stephen, History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, IX, 24. 2 Cf. these authors ad loc. 215</page><page sequence="2">216 MAX WIENER [2] tional equipment of any gentleman of breeding,3 Toland devoted to the linguistics of the Old Testament attention beyond the average. Toland was also well versed in Spinoza for whom he voices a profound respect, despite his vehement objections to Spinoza's metaphysics.4 The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus which had been translated into English already in 1689 received his thorough study. He was likewise conversant with Richard Simon (Histoire(Histoire critique du Vieu Testament, Paris 1678, English trans lation 1682) whom he often quotes, with grateful acknowledge ment, as Father Simon. In short, all of Toland's writings reveal that, more than most deistic thinkers, he fathomed the depths of oriental and biblical scholarship which flourished so mightily about the year 1700.5 That he pursues philological interests even apart from his deistic prepossessions, and is sufficiently at home in Old Testament exegesis to cope with certain special problems in that field we shall presently show. His main concern, of course, is the meaning of Christianity; and it is this question that dominated his interest in Judaism as a problem in the field of the history of religion. But, since he always attempts to bolster his "rational" analysis of Church dogma by a criticism of Church tradition, a thorough discussion of the relation of Judaism to Christian origins could not be avoided. His main work Christianity not Mysterious uses Locke's theory of cognition to destroy as self-contradictory the orthodox claims of the unintelligibility or superrationality of Christian dogma. Some later historical essays attempt to give a picture of Christian origins, especially of the intentions of the Founder of Christianity and his personal disciples drawn from a critical view of patristic and later tradition. In this connection, he develops a theory of Judaism which is not only intended to clarify his torically the relation between the faith of Jesus and the religion of Moses but whose further purpose it is to establish the con נ About the study of Hebrew and all Oriental languages in the early 18th century, cf.

Jewish law, according to Toland, is the core of the problem of the Christian-Jewish relation. Its meaning for Judaism and for emergent Christianity had to be determined. To this, in the main, are devoted the contents of his most important historical treatise Nazarenus.6 While the material on which Toland focuses his attention clearly shows, at the same time, his dependence on Spinoza, his evaluations and conclusions differ widely. This English Deist appears to have held a rather peculiar middle position between the theory of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and Moses Mendelssohn's Jerusalem. We shall, therefore, speak briefly about our main points of interest in these two theories. In the Tractatus Spinoza puts Mosaic-Rabbinical Judaism in opposition not so much to Christianity as to the belief and above all to the moral doctrine of Jesus. It is obvious that the theological metaphysics of the Church fitted his system no better and no worse than the Biblical and rabbinical belief in the per sonal and anthropomorphic Revealer of the Mosaic law. The language of Benedict Spinoza, while making extensive use of the terminology used by religions based on revelation (though often obscuring the sense) can hardly cover up the observation that the "voice of God,"7 represented by Jesus, should be placed in the same stratum of reality as the voice which the children of Israel heard at Sinai, i. e., in the realm of myth. But no matter in what round-about way Spinoza may speak regarding the metaphysical being of Jesus, there can be no doubt that he prefers the ethical contents of Jesus' pronouncements to the Mosaic-Jewish Law. The reason for this lies in the fact that he regarded Jesus' word as a moral command directed to all men, while the Mosaic doctrine appears to him a typical expression of particularistic interests. Law for him is the essence of the Jewish religion. This is and always will be the political and social constitution of a definite people, i.e., the Israelites. The Law demands obedience; it has its rightful place and function within 6 1718, Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity. 7 Tractatus theolog.-polit., c. 1, Gebhardt III, p. 17, 21.</page><page sequence="4">218 MAX WIENER [4] a nation that, from barbarism and slavery, had to be led to the beginnings of moral conduct. It is revealed by Moses, speaking in the name of God, only to the People of the Book, and its exis tence is inextricably bound up with the life of this national group.8 Thus the essence of Old Testament religion is comprised entirely in the Law. Only the Law and its educational function are impor tant. The theological and metaphysical conceptions which were offered in connection with the revelation of the Law are immature and crude. They show that Judaism as a religion in no way points beyond its own confines. Spinoza admits historical development in the theory of religion no more than in his metaphysics. Judaism has for him, above all, a national character; its religious sources yield a political constitution which carries with it and aspires to carry with it no obligation beyond the national limits. With this, a breach is made in the Church's conception of Judaism as the precursor of the final, true belief. Judaism also becomes stamped as the product of a true revelation. Spinoza who, either directly or through Pierre Bayle's Historical and Critical Critical Dictionary, influenced the philosophy of history pre vailing at the period of the enlightenment, contributed a great deal toward bringing about the rejection of the theological inter pretation customarily accorded the people of the Old Testament. This corresponds directly with the tendency of that period to secularize history. In our particular case that meant the need of proving that the presumably unique thoughts and achieve ments of the people of the Bible had been anticipated among other nations either at an earlier time or in a more adequate manner. Voltaire9 especially excelled in this art of transvaluation. Oriental peoples, Persians, Chinese, and later above all the Hindus thus contested the Jewish people's honor of having been the earliest adherents of a lofty ethical system. Mendelssohn's Jerusalem, in principle, takes over Spinoza's view with regard to the position of the Law as the core of Juda ism. But, remaining an orthodox Jew, Mendelssohn evaluates 8 Tract, theol.-polit. c. 5, Gebhardt, p. 70 f. ®9 Cf. Emmerich, Hanna, Das Judentum bei Voltaire (Vol. VI der Romani schen Reihe der Sammlung Sprache und Kultur der Germanisch-romanischen Volker, 1930.)</page><page sequence="5">[5] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 219 the Law differently. In his writings, we find that characteristic tension between the doctrine of God and of rational morals as the one pole and the system of the ceremonies as the other. Religious or metaphysical truth, commonly accepted and based on reason, stands in antithesis to the religious Law. And only the members of the Jewish community are duty-bound to that law because infallible tradition had established it as the revealed expression of the divine will. And since, in Mendelssohn's theol ogy, only the theoretical doctrines of religion are based on reason, the uniqueness of Judaism consists for him in the Mosaic-Rab binical Law exclusively. The connection between law and rational religious doctrine is established by making the Jewish com munity the special, divinely appointed guardian of rational religion, educated for its task by that very Law. Spinoza forms his opinions from a point of view which is beyond all positive belief. True religion coincides for him with his own metaphysics. Mendelssohn is an orthodox Jew and, at the same time, the herald of natural religion. He differs from Spinoza in acknowledging that the Law has the task and the power to secure practical functioning for rational religion which in the Torah is not taught as something new, but is rather pre supposed. The entire period of enlightenment held the opinion that Judaism was law, essentially a practical legal and social consti tution for the Jewish community. Either expressly or not, Spinoza's opinion was adopted by everyone. A breakdown of the Law meant the loss of Judaism's right of existence. To the Christian disciples of Spinoza the worthlessness of the Law was an accepted fact, and for them, this seemed to argue against the planned emancipation of the Jews. Therefore, there could be no tolerance for Judaism, but only an integration of the Jewish individual into the social and political group. This is how we have to understand the motto which Count Clermont-Tonnerre formulated at the beginning of the French Revolution, namely, to grant nothing to the Jews as a group, but everything to individuals. John Toland stands out in the history of the enlightenment by reason of his unique attitude toward Judaism and especially</page><page sequence="6">220 MAX WIENER [6] toward the Law, which he characterizes as the core of Judaism. This thinker put his main emphasis on free religious thinking not hemmed in by dogmas. The uniqueness of his position, there fore, could be expressed as follows: Spinoza made his demand for freedom of thinking and teaching dependent upon the idea that, whatever was important for the conduct of life and of social behavior had to be based exclusively on ethical, rationally estab lished laws. Toland rests his demand for tolerance on the his torical proof that the three monotheistic religions, practically the only relevant ones, correspond to an original plan, which is clearly discernable in the New Testament. Judaism for him is not outlived or rendered worthless or put aside by Christ, and much less by Paul. Islam is not a caricature of Jewish or of Christian thoughts but is linked with traditions reaching back to the time of Christ. Toland tries to show that an original plan of Christianity existed, which did not concede exclusive value to the religion newly revealed by Christ. Its purpose was to proselytize among the heathen, to convert them to a faith, free from irrational dogmas, containing naught but rational religion. Judaism was not to be molested, nor was the merit of its unique laws to be challenged. It is for this reason that the Nazarenus bears the subtitle Nazarenus or Jewish, Gentile Gentile and Mahometan Christianity. The introduction anticipates the result of Toland's inter pretation of the gospels. There are two forms of Christianity: the Jewish, which was not to be changed by the belief in Christ, and that of the Gentiles. For the appearance of Christ did not mean the dissolution of Judaism but rather the weaving of a bond between Jews and Gentiles, a link which meant "unity without uniformity."10 The mystery revealed by Jesus, of which Paul speaks, is the true religious cognition —"fellowship in piety and virtue." Jews and Gentiles alike have to fulfill in Christ that "inward and spiritual virtue," which alone is belief. Belief is nothing but "internal participation of the divine nature, irradi ating the soul; and eternally appearing in beneficence, justice, sanctity and those other virtues by which we resemble God." 10 Naz., V. cf. Christianity not Mysterious, pp. 72-74.</page><page sequence="7">[7] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 221 The Jews, however, no matter whether they confessed the belief in Christ or not, remain subject to those "civil and national rites" which have to be observed eternally in the Jewish Republic. They must not allow their obligations toward the Law to be nullified by forced and artificial allegories." Toland promises here, as he does in other places, a special treatment of the Mosaic constitution, but he never went beyond the first beginnings." His reflections on "antinomianism" grow out of his religious con ception —"for as the body without the breath is dead, so faith without works is dead also; yea and by works man is justified and not by Faith."13 For this reason he also rejects expressly Luther's polemics against the Epistle of James.14 For Toland in his role as polemicist and as historian of relig ion, it is important to prove that the three monotheistic religions are to be regarded as equals. The claims of the Church for the exclusiveness of Christianity are to be reduced ad absurdum by a correct conception of the New Testament sources themselves. One could characterize this attempt as the establishment of the rational truth underlying the three religions by recourse to the documents of the gospels. No one has doubted the connection between Judaism and Christianity. But for Toland's theory of the history of religion, it is no less important to show the link between Christianity and Islam. His thinking lays stress on proving that the dogmatic congelation of Christianity is not im plied in its original sources, but is entirely due to the uncontrolled phantasy of the tradition which came subsequent to these original documents. The composition of the present canon of the New Testament is largely accidental. Of an abundance of equally valid old sources some were lost and others branded heretical by the dominant Church. It is not necessary to treat here in detail the evidence that led Toland to assume that there existed an old gospel, named after Barnabas,15 the companion of Paul, 11 Naz., VIII; about the rejection of the allegorizing interpretation of the Bible cf. also Christianity not Mysterious, p. 2. 12 Cf. below. 3־ Naz., XIII. '4 Naz., XIV. 1s Naz., pp. 6-9.</page><page sequence="8">222 MAX WIENER [8] mentioned quite frequently in the history of the Apostles, which was known to emerging Islam and served it somewhat as an authority. Toland is particularly anxious to make Islamic tra dition itself profess the tendency to see its own religion tied up with Christianity and Judaism according to "God's Economy." There are supposed to be outlined six steps of religious develop ment symbolized by the names Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed.16 These steps represent one and the same religion even though each succeeding step is superior to the preceding ones. Indeed, besides their Koran, the Mohammedans recognize as part of their canon the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the Gospels. Quoting as his authority Adrian Reland's work De ReligioneReligione Mahommedina Libri Duo and also Arabic writers, Toland avers that the references to, the preceding religions found in the Koran are proof that a strong consciousness of the unity of the three religions is alive in Islam.17 Perhaps the Moham medans have in their possession still older documents and tra ditions which point to this pre-Koranic literature; for the abun dance of the quotations, far exceeding those in the Koran hints at such a "gospel" as their source. Toland, in fact, offers the practical suggestion of having travellers in Islamic countries make this older literature accessible to European investigation.18 He claims to have seen an Italian manuscript with Arabic mar ginals, which was called Barnabas' Gospel. It describes the life of Jesus quite differently from the other gospels. Mohammed is looked upon as the promised Paraclet while Jesus is considered only a human being. It also retains the Mohammedan tradition that someone other than Jesus was crucified. In Toland, the joy of the rationalist in a natural tradition which has no recourse to miracles outweighs the sane judgement of the historian. He finds the contents of this gospel much to his liking and, therefore, would want to put it on at least equal footing with those of the canon. At any rate, he wishes to draw from it the conclusion that there must have been other traditions which the unprejudiced critical scientist must consider. 16 Naz., pp. 9-11. 17 Naz., pp. 11-14. 18 Naz., Appendix, p. 14 ff.</page><page sequence="9">[9] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 223 The problem of the connection between Christianity and Islam and of the Barnabas Gospel was of considerable theoretical importance for Toland's historical investigation, because it un dermined the claim of exclusiveness put forth by the official Church. But the elucidation of the relation between Judaism and Christianity was closer at hand and more important. From the beginning of Christian development, starting almost with Paul, the form taken by the religion of the Gospels was, according to Toland, a falsification of the obvious meaning of Christ and his most authoritative apostles. The perversion of the relation to Judaism which Jesus had intended nullified Christ's original plan. The meaning of Christian revelation is quite obvious to the scientist who investigates the Gospels soberly and without preju dice. There is unmistakable proof that the Ebionites or Nazar enes, i. e., the original and, at any rate, the first Christians, branded Paul as an apostate from the Law and rejected his letters.19 They considered Jesus on his mother's and father's side only as a human being; the phrase "son of God" was for them only a term for a truly virtuous character. The continued obser vance of the Jewish Law was for them a matter of course. In the fourth century, Eusebius reports that even those among them who held that Jesus was born of a virgin through the Holy Ghost did nevertheless not believe in his divine nature.20 It was on account of this apostasy that they were branded as heretics by the Church Fathers. As Jews and followers of the Law, they opposed Paul who despised the Law.21 They looked upon him as an intruder into genuine Christianity who never knew Christ in person, and supplanted Jesus' true teaching with his own al leged revelations. Among the Jews who did not believe in Christ, the Nazarenes were called minim and were cursed three times daily in the prayers, because they were considered to be apostates from the pure faith. When the heathen Christians had established their own congregation, Jewish circles were at a loss regarding the Nazarenes and thus, at times, confounded them with the heathen. But Selden recognized the truth. He considered them י י Naz., p. 28. : Naz., p. 29.</page><page sequence="10">224 MAX WIENER [10] to be the genuine original Christians, i. e., Jews who believed in Christ. Justly, therefore, Christianity appeared to him as nothing but reformed Judaism.22 Paul, moreover, never denied that the gospel which he preached was one which did not come directly from Jesus. He admitted having talked only to Peter and to Jacob, Jesus' brother, during a short visit to Jerusalem.23 But he also claims that, at that time, an agreement had been reached between him and the two apostles to the effect that he was to preach the gospel among the Gentiles and they among the Jews. The Ebionites simply denied the existence of such an agreement. Be that as it may, Toland is convinced that the Nazarenes correctly grasped the original idea of Christianity. The purpose, as they conceived it, was "to set the original plan of Christianity in its proper light; the want of which made it a mystery to both Jew and Gentile, before the declaration of it by Jesus; but since that declaration it ceases to be longer a mystery to any, but to such as love dark ness better than light. . ."24 The contrast between Paul and the Jewish leaders coincides with the contrast between a falsified Christianity and an original, genuine Christianity. The tradition of the Ebionites still pre serves traces of their profound suspicion against Paul. According to Epiphanias, they had their own history of the Apostles which questioned whether this Paul of Tarsus had been a Jew at all.25 There he is supposed to have become a convert to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of the High Priest and is supposed to have attacked the Law, when those hopes were frustrated. It is certain that he was in disfavor with the elders and with Jacob on account of his antinomianistic attitude. We can also see that, perturbed by their anger, he made occasional conces sions, such as in the case of vows.26 He finally admitted that the Law remained binding for the Jews. Only the heathen who had been converted to the belief in Christ were to be freed from the 22 Naz., p. 30. 2323 Naz., p. 31. 24 Naz., p. 33. 23 Naz., p. 35. 26 Naz., p. 36.</page><page sequence="11">[11] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 225 Law. But even they had to submit to four particular restrictions taken from the Noachidic laws. They had to refrain from idolatry, from eating blood or the meat of animals that had suffocated, and from incest. From this we may conclude that, even according to Paul, genuine Christianity did not imply a break with Judaism. Toland quotes the interpretation of the contemporary orientalist James Rhenferd who explains 1 Cor. 7.17-20 in this sense. In what other manner could Paul have justified himself before the Ebionites?27 Toland adds polemically that these statements are not new; they are simply the corroboration of the truth. They are "the old foundations." Those theologians who are enamoured of their mistakes are, by this healthy criticism, robbed of the reasons by which they seek to justify the eternal war between the Jews and the heathen Christians. What is the Jewish Law? The Ebionites and, with them, Jacob and the Elders, to whom the "levitical" laws were dear, saw in the Law a double meaning : it was national and political as well as religious and sacred. The Law is essential for their theocracy or "republic," as becomes evident from that Torah itself. Toland quotes here many verses from Exodus and Deuteronomy. But this law of the Torah, according to its authoritative interpreter, Maimonides, lays no claim to being obligatory for anyone but the Israelites; it remains always "the inheritance of the congre gation of Jacob."28 Proselytes may accept it; but non-Jews are not forced to live by it. The Jews were convinced of the eternal validity of the Law, including circumcision, Sabbath, and holi days. And when, as believers in Christ, they listened to Jesus, that conviction as to the eternal validity of the Mosaic code was confirmed. True, Jesus at times opposed excessive Pharisaic additions, but he never spoke against the Law as such. It is char acteristic that Toland does not use derogatory terms against the Pharisees, and that he omits the New Testament criticism of the Rabbis in spite of his frequent quotations. The spearhead of his attack is directed not against Judaism, but against the Christian theologians whose falsifying interpretation, according 2ל Naz., p. 38. 28 Naz., p. 39.</page><page sequence="12">226 MAX WIENER [12] to his views, opened up a gap between the Jesus religion and Judaism.29 Toland is convinced that Jesus, the apostles, and the Nazarenes were in complete agreement with regard to the Law. He emphasizes that internal evidence precludes all suspicion that the attitude of the early Christian authorities amounted only to a wise concession for a limited time. Rather he reiterates that Mosaic Judaism was regarded as valid for all times. The Law was not tolerated; it was looked upon as a command. "Toleration" is certainly both a human and a Christian duty and nobody ought to be annoyed over a speculative difference. Yet, he emphasizes that Jesus and his apostles had a conviction as to the eternal obligatoriness of the levitical law which differed widely from a mere forbearance that generously tolerates a dis senting opinion. Christianity understood the eternal validity of the Law quite literally and not merely as an obligation lasting only to the reign of Emperor Tiberius.30 This thought is also expressed by Justin Martyr, though Justin says that the Jews received the Law because of the stubbornness of their hearts.31 Toland, while acknowledging that Justin Martyr advo cated a brotherly relation between Jews and heathen, opposes the idea that any blame should fall upon the heathen because of the Law observed by persons of Jewish birth. The heathen Christians were not to be forced to observe the Law. But the above mentioned four Noachidic commandments, according to all Christian authorities, are obligatory for all con verts. According to Toland, the observance of these precepts became necessary for the heathen Christians so as not to remove altogether the possibility of common meals between the old Christians and the new. The heathen Christians could no more be exempted from the Noachidic restrictions,32 than could those who were born as Jews be freed from the obligation of observing the Law. The great mysterium of Paul consisted thus in adding to the recipients of God's pardoning grace those heathen con verts by whom the levitical law was not observed. The Law is •1 ־'yu&gt;z., jj. ti. 1נ Naz., p. 42. 3ב Naz., p. 43.</page><page sequence="13">[13] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 227 not forced upon the heathen, although the obligation continues to rest upon the Jews. When Peter ate with the converted heathen Cornelius, it must have paralleled somewhat the situation of today when an orthodox Jew partakes of a meal with a Christian; that is to say the former abstained from forbidden foods. Thus the Mosaic republic could prosper well in Palestine. Whether its citizens were Christians or Jews, the only observance asked of the heathen Christians who lived on its soil was that they believe in the one God and keep the Noachidic laws. According to Toland, the Jewish Law did not ask for more from the "proselytes of justice."33 The second part of the treatise does not add anything essen tially new, but it contains some details that are highly char acteristic of Toland's attitude towards Judaism. The fact that the Noachidic laws were preserved for quite a long time in Christendom, and especially in the Eastern Church, proves that Christianity, even at a later period, did not break completely with its original idea, in spite of all dogmatic speculations and falsifications. Cardinal Humbert, writing in the eleventh century, points out that the eating of those restricted foods, except in the case of actual danger to one's life, was still strictly forbidden and had to be punished with a severe ecclesiastical penance. Great historic figures such as Hugo Grotius and G. J. Vossius and others are invoked to testify that the obligatory nature of the Noachidic laws had been acknowledged by the Church. Toland uses this testimony to attack the ignorance and carelessness of the theo logians who pay so little attention to their established Christian duties.34 And thus the practice of faithful Christians who eat birds that were caught in a snare cannot be justified.35 There is no mistaking the ironical undertone of this remark. The enlightened "freethinker" certainly does not intend to introduce any, not even the Noachidic, dietary laws into the Christian religion of " Naz., p. 44. 3434 Cf. Spinoza's hostile interpretation of Maimonides' view of the ZadikeZadike 'umot'umot Ha'olam (c. 5 Gebhardt, pp. 79-80). If there was in Christianity, up to very recent times, still a feeling for the validity of the Noachide laws, the reproach of the Tract, against Maimonides' alleged intolerance is invalid. 3s Naz., p. 47.</page><page sequence="14">228 MAX WIENER [14] his time. But his irony serves him as a weapon which he turns against what he regards as a misleading interpretation of the history of religion. Christianity and Judaism or better, the religion of the Old and of the New Testament belong much closer to each other, according to his views, than the snobbery and exclusiveness of the hierarchy would grant. Therefore, he makes full use of the term Noachides and, in connection with Mai monides, discusses the distinction between "proselytes of justice" and "proselytes of the gate." To the latter, the Noachidic laws are obligatory only because they are considered as having been revealed. The Torah often stresses the fact that one law should apply to both the Israelite and the stranger. And the term "stranger" was understood to mean the Noachide and, according to the Jewish view,36 we have to add to these the heathen Christians. Thus Paul in 1 Cor. 8.9, speaking to non-Jews, affirms his indifference toward the dietary laws, yet forbids heathen Christians to eat the meat of sacrificial animals.37 Had the Church recognized that Christ's intention was not the destruc tion but the extension of Jewish teaching, Christianity would not, beginning with the time of the Church fathers, have suffered such irreparable damage. Nowhere was there a provision in the original plan of Jesus to rob the Jews of their position as "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." But the original mistake was made by the Church fathers who failed to understand the meaning of the Nazarenes, who did not recognize them as the original Christian community which ob served the Law, and who saw in them nothing but outspoken heretics.38 The Church Fathers sowed that infinite hatred be tween heathen Christians and Jews, though the Fathers owed to none but the Nazarenes the gospels and Christianity. This situation is all the more grievous since, in a man like Epiphanias, we can perceive a faint idea of the true state of affairs. No matter how intolerant or ignorant he may have been he, at least, knew that the Nazarenes differed from the Jews by their belief in Jesus, and from the Christians by their observance of the Law. 36 Naz., p. 49. " Naz., p. 50. 38 Naz., p. 51.</page><page sequence="15">[15] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 229 Nor does he state that the Nazarenes attempted to force the Law upon the heathen. What could history have been spared had this simple distinction between these two groups always been remem bered ! What strife and what intolerant prescriptions, such as the Apostolic Constitutions and the edicts of Constantine the Great, would have been unnecessary ! Toland is interested in showing that the separation of Chris tianity from the Law did not succeed completely, in spite of all the enmity and intolerance. The official Church was compelled to retain the Noachidic laws, though other laws, such as the sacrament of unction, attracting less attention, were added to Christian usage. Toland quotes the Talmud Yerush. where Simon ben Eleazar gives permission to Rabbi Meir to mix wine and oil on the Sabbath in order to heal a sick person.39 This is also found in Yoma 77b. The apostle Jacob, for this reason, asks the Judeo-Christians to bring their sick to the church where the elders, amid prayers, would anoint them with oil so that the Lord might forgive their sins. This, apparently, is the origin of the Catholic sacrament of extreme unction (compare with this Mark 6.13). An obviously Jewish custom here has become a sacrament, but the sanctification of the Sabbath by the Nazar enes was accounted a terrible crime.40 It happened, accordingly, that Jerome asked that the Nazarenes be excommunicated be cause they adulterated their Christian belief with Jewish customs. Intolerance and oppressive uniformity are thus ancient phenom ena, ancient also are their effects, for this criminal treatment frightened the Jews away from Christianity. The vulgar practice won out over a clearer41 theoretical insight. For example, Aug ustine had a correct conception of the origin of the Nazarene group, but he no longer dared to draw the necessary conclusions. For him Jewish customs had become such as are practiced only in the Synagogue of Satan. Contary to all historical truth, this intolerant and hostile view gained the upper hand.42 Only when one brushes aside this entire rubbish, can one understand what original Christianity had intended to do, namely, to make Juda</page><page sequence="16">230 MAX WIENER [16] ism accessible and useful for the heathen of the world, by abolish ing the Jewish customs. This interpretation is further confirmed by the Christian traditions among the believers in Islam of a later epoch. These, as we have already seen, go back to an old gospel named after Barnabas. But if Peter, the Martyr (in the fourth part of his book Common Places) is correct in his opinion that Islam is a heretical Christian doctrine, then one ought to concede to the Mohammedans the same right as have other sects, i. e., to build mosques in Christian cities. It is obvious that Toland wanted tolerance extended not only to the Nazarenes, retrospectively as it were, but that he meant to include con temporary Jews as well. He clearly demanded for them social emancipation and equal treatment.42 But within the framework of this treatise about the history of religion, he is chiefly inter ested in establishing their theological rights. For this reason, he combats tirelessly and repeatedly the anti-Semitism of the Church. We have seen that he intended to absolve even Paul of a radical hostility towards the Law. And thus he states aphoristically that Jacob, speaking to the Jews, demanded both belief and deeds while Paul, turning to the heathen, insisted only on the right belief.43 When we read (Gal. 3.24-25; Col. 2.14) that the Law was to be our educator preparing us for Christ, and that its precepts were nullified and crucified on Jesus' cross, then these are valid only for the heathen and not for the Jews. In one single instance only, a change in the Law is admitted : the sacrifices have lost their meaning. But even this is found to have been indicated in the Old Testament when the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Joel and the rest point out the secondary value of sacrifices.44 For Toland, religion is "not mysterious" and thus he encounters no difficulty in claiming that even pre-Christian Judaism was belief, i. e., purely rational religion. The teachings of Jesus and his apostles coincide for him fully with the faith of the Old Testament. Their message to the Jews is merely a repeti tion of the old doctrine that true observance of the Law requires inner regeneration and belief. Likewise the Paulin ian emphasis 4242 Naz., pp. 58-61. « Cf. below. 44 Naz., p. 63.</page><page sequence="17">[17] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 231 on belief contains nothing (Rom. 3.27-31) which would abolish any of the important values so dear to the Jews.45 This, to speak simply and clearly, is the idea which original Christianity repre sented: to be the path for a unification of Jews and heathen and, at the same time, the means by which God's revelation might be brought into consonance with itself. "Justifying God himself against those who object the mutability of imperfection of giving one law at one time and another law at another time, whereas there is no such abrogating or obrogating according to the Original Plan of Christianity. The religion that was true yesterday is not false to-day; neither can it ever be false, if ever it was once true."46 We have to understand this statement in the light of Toland's general theory of religion. For him there are no unintelligible or supra-rational doctrines, no rightfully existing "mysteries."47 This is true, he believes, particularly as regards the false con elusions which posterity drew from the Paulinian teaching about sin and forgiveness. Judaism, as Jesus found it, was "rational" like any natural religion, and therefore the best that Christ could do was to recognize its clarity and to teach it effectively. Because whatever might be added by way of reason would detract from it, never contribute to it. Toland uses the term "revela tion" in an adaptive sense as did most of the enlightened thinkers, who were no longer orthodox and as did also Spinoza. God reveals himself to men in natural reason. This is not only generally valid for men but also completely sufficient. Characteristically, he cites here an author outside of the Jewish-Christian circle, namely Cicero, and his doctrine of the agreement of genuine law with generally functioning, healthy reason.48 Following Whitchcot, Toland states that natural religion is eleven-twelfths of all relig ion. He does not tell us what the last twelfth might be, but it is not difficult to guess: it is everything that does not belong in a genuine faith.49 « Naz., p. 64. ■6י Naz., p. 65. 4' Naz., p. 65. 48 Cf. to this as particularly important: Christianity not Mysterious, pp. 90-92. 4' Naz., p. 66.</page><page sequence="18">232 MAX WIENER [18] Thus Toland approaches Mendelssohn's conception very closely. Judaism is a rational religion plus Mosaic Law. He even agrees with the Jewish sage's opinion that this law, as such, had nothing to do with religious doctrine, but that it existed because of special circumstances. According to Mendelssohn, the Law derives its authority and obligatory nature from the divine act of revelation. According to Toland, its authority rests upon the genius of Moses, the greatest of all lawgivers. Both thinkers can be understood only as the spiritual heirs of Spinoza who con strued the Law as a separate entity alongside of a real belief or a peculiar view of the world. It is only as to the direction of interest that the two Jews and the Christian thinker differ. The one wishes to restore ancient Christianity, the others at tempt to analyze Judaism. Essentially Toland's restoration of Christianity amounts not only to a radical and rationalist destruction of dogma as such but also to the elimination of antinomianism as a sentiment.50 He regards scepticism about good deeds as meaningful because it elucidates the truth that no human being can earn merit before God, not even by good deeds. This, however, though appealing to natural religiosity, is nothing less than a mystery.51 According to Toland Jesus did not teach anything new, but only repeated the old doctrines of Judaism. Therefore, Toland's reprimand directed against Jesus' Jewish contemporaries on the grounds that they did not acknowl edge him as a prophet of their own religion, but opposed him, takes on a meaning entirely different from the reproach of stiff neckedness and infidelity hurled against the Jews by the official Church. Yes, the blame is taken from the Jews and shifted to their obstinate priests who distorted the original law of Moses. That was how they came to withdraw themselves from the preach ing of Jesus, their "spiritual lawgiver," and failed to recognize the wonderful economy which was incorporated in the plan of uni fication in Christ of heathen and Jews. Toland's theory prevents him from advocating the subsequent conversion of the Jews to Christianity, because for him union did not mean mixture. The 50 Naz., p. 67. s1 Naz., p. 69.</page><page sequence="19">[19] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 233 members of the Jewish tribe, even had they all become Nazar enes, were supposed to have retained their Mosaic Law and to have assured their existence by the observance of this Law. This was implied in the original plan of Christianity. And the fact of Jewish persistence down to the present only tended to corrobo rate the wisdom of this plan. But the theology of even the oldest Christianity, by not understanding the character of the Nazarene group, laid the foundation of a historical error of world-wide ramifications which progressively poisoned the relation between Jews and Christians. In connection with his philological proofs Toland once more finds traces of some specifically Nazarene gospels in Irenaeus and Epiphanias, and even in Luke.52 This ought to prove an incentive to scientific research to find the truth by reverting to the original sources. We accomplish naught by appealing to Apostolic successions and sacred traditions. In this respect one sect was justified as much as the other. Each had its tradition. The genuine gospel knows nothing of Jesus' inténtion to abolish the Law for the Jews or to subjugate it to clerical interpretation, "Therefore I say: to the Law and to the Testimony!"55 Upon this first part of the Nazarenus, Toland had a second one follow in the same year with the title "An account of an Irish Manuscript of the four Gospels."54 Its contents stand in no rela tion to the topic of our discussion. But the tendency of the second part is the same as that of the first. The spectacle of the pre Roman Catholic Christianity of the Irish people is to serve as an example of the simplicity and rationality of a religion not dim med by dogmatic complications and theological speculations. But Toland did not write the treatise about res publica mosaicamosaica which he had several times promised in the first part. Instead, he added an appendix to the Nazarenus whose part I interests us in this connection.55 The Mosaic Law is praised as the most admirable form of a constitution which has, at any 5־ Naz., p. 70/71. 53 Naz., pp. 79-84.

The two problems which apparently were supposed to have been treated in the treatise are (1) "The riddle of the persistence of the Jews to this day" and (2) "How it happened that the Jews so often were disloyal to their Law." According to the spirit of the times, the Mosaic Law was compared with Plato's Atlantis and Thomas More's Utopia.56 The Jews, dispersed over the entire world and always more hated than liked, have maintained their existence; the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans have vanished. This can only be explained by the effectiveness of their constitution or by Divine Providence or by a combination of both. We may assume that the proposed treatise would have emphasized the first factor. According to the sparse hints, we could have expected a political dissertation. Toland had apparently intended to compare the Mosaic theocracy with the theories of Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. Among contemporary phenomena, he might have considered the much admired fepublic of Venice, which at Toland's time was Europe's oldest state. From a quotation of Cicero and from the title, it appears that he felt the need to confirm the thesis that a people's existence was assured by a well ordered constitution.57 For, though the Palestinian commonwealth of the Jews was destroyed, Toland considers their heirs in the diaspora as a sep arate group sharply differing from the others by their habits and religious customs. From all this, we can clearly see the connec tion with the theory of Spinoza. But Toland does not follow Spinoza's evaluation. For Spinoza, in his deprecatory and un friendly manner, attributed to the Mosaic law merely the func tion of teaching a barbarian nation of slaves the most primitive concepts of order and self-restraint by conditioning them to strict discipline. Toland thinks much more highly of Mosaic Judaism. Mosaism contains for him, already as a religion, the eternal and unsurpassable principle of reason. As a law he esteems it much too highly to impute to it the pedagogical function of subjecting absolutely primitive human beings to the first formation of their will by more or less arbitrary statutes. 56 Appendix, p. 3. 57 Appendix, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="21">[21] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 235 For he sees in its success of securing the continued existence of that group the proof of Moses' admirable and eternal wisdom. It is true that in his polemics against Christian antinomianism, he refers again and again to those words of the Torah which are related to the eternal validity of the law of Israel, and which were never opposed by Christ and his immediate disciples. But the revelation of such a code of law was for him not quite as impor tant as was the enduring intrinsic value which he attributed to it. His reference to it as a revelation betokens an adaptation to the thinking and to the manner of speech prevalent among his Christian orthodox opponents whom he attempts to strike with their own weapons. His abiding intention is to prove the permanent historical right of Judaism to exist side by side with Christianity. Con sistent with this point of view is his active participation in the affairs of contemporary Jews. Occasionally he hints at the fact that he counted some Jews among his personal acquaintances and friends, and in a special essay he advocated the emancipation of the Jews. The title of the essay is: "Reason for Naturalizing the Jews in Great-Britain and Ireland, on the same foot with all other Nations. Containing also, a Defense of the Jews against all vulgar Prejudices in all Countries." (1714).58 The Nazarenus, whose importance E. C. Mossner has pointed out recently,59 has to be understood as an attempt on the part of Deism to view the monotheistic religions as a historic unit. By means of historical research, Christian orthodoxy is here denied its claim of exclusiveness. Toland replaces super-rational revelation, which for him carries no longer any authority, with the economy of world history. Its effects, however, according to the opinion of these thinkers of the period of enlightenment, are constantly blocked by the stupidity and the selfishness of priests and theologians. In Toland more than in other thinkers of his time, it appears that the history of religion has its meaning in the universalism established with the help of rationality in s8 The motives of this essay are Toland's mercantilism and his hatred of the clergy. Max Vogelstein called my attention to these tendencies. 8י "Bishop Butler," p. 66.</page><page sequence="22">236 MAX WIENER [22] religion, while retaining the multiplicity of the religious groups. In this plan Judaism has a place. With this tendency, a second one is closely bound up. If history, by intelligible means, strives towards an intelligible goal, there can be no break in the natural rules of becoming; hence there is no place for miracles. Christianity not Mysterious attempted to shed light upon the darkness of Christian "mys teries," which meant for Toland that they should be replaced by ethical reasoning. In this approach to the Old Testament Toland is not so much interested in unintelligible doctrines of faith as he is in the extraordinary natural phenomenon regarded as miraculous. His essay Hodegus or the Pillar of Cloud and Fire that that guided the Israelites, not mysterious (London 1720) is an example of such rationalistic exegesis. Toland's presentation be comes a pattern for that rationalistic interpretation of the Bible that was so popular among the mass of those who had lost their belief. The old documents are not interpreted according to the content that they intended to convey — with due consideration for the influence exercised by myth-forming phantasy, by the genesis of legends, and by the peculiarities of tradition. Little attention was paid to the origin of the document and to its his torical and psychological setting and circumstances. All of these are rather presupposed and taken for granted, and one deletes from them only what is contradictory to "reason," i. e., the miracles. But Toland judges correctly when he says: "but nothing has so much contributed to create an aversion in general spirits against the study of the Old Testament, as a persuasion taken up implicitely from their childhood, that it is throughout a scene of Incompréhensibles, and a complete system of Miracles."60 Toland himself does not claim that all of the miracles of the Old Testament represent themselves as natural phenomena, per ceived as such under a rationalistic interpretation. But he thinks nevertheless that more than two thirds of the apparent miracles of the Old Testament were not meant as such by their authors. This attempt to diminish the number of miracles is indeed char acteristic of this type of exegesis. Then one hopes to do away 60 Hod., p. S.</page><page sequence="23">[23] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 237 somehow with the remaining few. Toland in contrast to Spinoza, who preceded him, and Voltaire, who came afterwards, attempts to ascribe to Scripture's personalities an important place in the history of the human genius, though he is quite ready to divest Scripture of its supernatural character. There is still no trace of the esthetic approach to the Bible. HodegusHodegus is much inferior to the Nazarenus. In the Hodegus Toland attempts to prove that the pillar of fire and cloud, which guided the Israelites on their journey through the desert, was not really a miracle but only a very useful device. They were "machines of mere human contrivance, ambulatory beacons."61 The details are curious but of little historical interest. It is of greater importance that, with great effort and scholarly toil, Toland uses the proof by historical analogy, adopted later on by Voltaire and other critics of religion. From reports found in Silius Italicus, Lucanus, Plinius, Quintus Curtius, one can pre sumably conclude that Alexander the Great and Hannibal, in their marches across desert lands, also used portable signs of fire and smoke.62 Moses is supposed to have done exactly the same. These fire signs were lit "on the top of the Tabernacle." For the travels of the people were determined according to the Tabernacle's position. Toland believes himself able to detect a particularly close resemblance between the Biblical account and the reports about the expeditions of Alexander the Great, as found in Curtius.63 It is to be assumed that Alexander learned this method from the Persians who, as Herodotus relates, had used such signals for many centuries. Thus we may also surmise that it was no accident that the methods and technique of march ing which the Jews employed in the desert were very similar to those of the Persians. Toland seems to assume that the report of the journey in the desert originated in a period when such con tact between the Jews and the Persians had long been estab lished. In fact, he thinks he has found yet further analogies be tween the religion of Moses and that of the Persians. His proofs are perhaps superficial even for his time. But his main interest 61 Hod., p. 7. Hod., p. 8-15. «3 Hod., p. 17-18.</page><page sequence="24">238 MAX WIENER [24] is, by means of his analogies, to shatter the belief in the miracu lous character and in the uniqueness of Biblical history. In this approach, too, Toland stands under the influence of Spinoza. Spinoza spoke of the difference between direct and indirect effects emanating from God.64 Toland apparently follows this suggestion in his interpretation of the words: "according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses," "which irresistibly evinces that what Moses ordered as Jehova's Deputy, Prime Minister and General, he said to be commanded by the Lord himself."63 According to Toland it is only the manner of speech of the Pentateuch that makes the movement of the pillar of fire and cloud appear as a divine miracle, while in reality they were effectuated by human hands. The problem of the language of the Bible offers occasion to open the discussion of literary composition in a connection that appears to us rather strange. According to Toland, many mis understandings, especially those arising from reports of sup posed miracles, could easily be corrected were we in the posses sion of the original history of the Jewish people, excerpts of which we have in the form of the Pentateuch and the other historical books. Toland bases his opinion upon the findings of the Orient alist scholar Triglandius who thought he had found the original comprehensive history of the Jewish people in the Sefer Hayashar which, according to his view, the Pentateuch and the books of Joshua and Judges had used as their source. The brevity of expression employed by the biblical authors was supposed to have been the cause of many confusions. Among these confusing statements belong several of the details told of the ark of the covenant.66 At times it appears as if the ark had moved of itself, in a miraculous fashion, though we are taught in other places that it was carried by men.67 When we read that God preceded the train of the Israelites, that meant that the ark of the covenant was carried before them. The ark of the covenant, the pillar of fire and of cloud are closely con 6י• Spinoza, Theolog.-Polit. Tract., c. 6, Gebh. p. 86 ff. «5 Hod., pp. 21-23, 24. 66 Hod., p. 25. «ל Hod., p. 26.</page><page sequence="25">[25] JOHN TOLAND AND JUDAISM 239 nected with each other and can be explained in a very natural manner.68 The same is true of the angel of the Lord who walked before or interposed himself between the army of the Egyptians and the hosts of the Israelites (Ex. 14, 19, 20).69 There is no end to the efforts that theologians expend on the interpretation of this angel. Some wished to see in him no less a person than Jesus himself. In reality, however, he was nothing but a mortal human being, i. e., that person who was in charge of the fire and smoke signals. He was therefore nothing but a very clever strat egem. Similarly, we can understand many other Biblical stories which the later writers of the Biblical canon — cf. e. g., Neh. 9 — and especially the theologians and the dogmatists fashioned into great miracles. Toland regrets that such a profound scholar as Manasseh ben Israel should be numbered among the believers in miracles.70 But this is essential to the development of the history of religion. Once the cloud had become a miracle, the door was opened to further speculations. Thus the cloud that covered the Tabernacle was linked with the one covering Mount Sinai.71 It was in a cloud that God met the High Priest. Solomon states that God wishes to live in impenetrable darkness, and thus the cloud was localized between the two cherubim in the Holy of Holies.72 Toland runs through the books of the prophets and the Psalms to show the various developments which the picture of the cloud had to undergo.73 Among the Rabbis and Church Fathers, the interpretation of the cloud becomes increasingly phantastic. Finally the Jews arrived at the belief that, at the time of the coming of the Messiah, clouds would rise from the four corners of the earth and travel towards the Holy Land.74 The rationalistic thinker, Toland, cannot suppress an ironical remark. But very characteristically, as regards his attitude toward his Jewish contemporaries, he states that he, in no wise, ז° Hod.., p. 33. 1י Hod., p. 34. 74 Hod,., p. 35. נז Hod., p. 38 ff. 74 Hod., p. 42.</page><page sequence="26">240 MAX WIENER [26] dislikes their company, because they are useful citizens, and some are his very good friends.75 Toland composed all of his essays somewhat loosely. Accord ingly he adds some miscellaneous exegetical remarks to the main content of his treatise. These remarks have no connection with his theme, but they deserve mention as samples of his "enlight ened" approach to the Bible. He fhinks that the Biblical exegetes could have saved themselves much trouble had they paid more attention to the original meaning of the word mal'ak.16 He claims that it can be proved philologically that the term does not con note a supernatural being. This contention is strengthened by the name of the prophet Malachi. The frequent mention of the term "the angel of the Lord" is due to the terminology of the theocratic system. This becomes evident particularly in the pas sage in the Book of Judges, ch. 2.1 ff. Mal'ak is the human guide, the messenger of God, because God himself is the king.77 Again&gt; as Spinoza points out, the confusion was due to the fact that the distinction between primary and secondary causes was not recognized. Toland believes himself able to prove that this angel or mes senger on the journey through the desert was none other than Moses' brother-in-law Hobab. He undertakes to solve the con fusion of the three names Hobab, Jethro, and Raguel by making Raguel the grand-father, Jethro the father, and Hobab the son. For this interpretation, he resorts to somè conjectures and to some transposition of verses.78 The last addendum is devoted to the history of the tribe of the Kenites of which Hobab was the head. Toland makes a dis tinction between these Midianitic Kenites and the Canaanitic tribe of the same name, mentioned in Gen. 15.19, and follows the development up to Jonadab, the son of Rechab. The Mid ianite group was supposed to have been a separate clan which joined the Israelites during the journey through the desert and maintained a special loyalty towards the Israelitic law.79 '5 Hod., p. 43. 6י Hod., pp. 46-48.

For, valid or not, they show how the door of scientific investigation as applied to the documents of Judaism and Christianity was grad ually opened and the way prepared for an approach which had freed itself of all dogmatic encumbrances. Toland lacked that depth of thought, and especially that restraint and objectivity which are necessary for the solution of these philological prob lems. After all, none of these critical thinkers, not even Spinoza, dealt with these studies of the text of the Bible and the history of religion for the sake of their intrinsic value. They used them rather as a means to an end. They sought to establish through them their fundamental, preconceived religious or philosophical idea, namely, that the written word which claimed to be the result of a revelation had to prove itself true before "reason." This led to the practical consequence that a good deal of the traditional interpretations of the Old and New Testament had to be rejected because they led to "irrational" conclusions. Bible criticism meant, in this case, that the Biblical doctrines and stories had to legitimate themselves as consonant with rational religion and ethics.80 To this general scheme of Biblical science in the period of enlightenment, Toland's attitude toward Judaism adds a special coloration. His main essay Christianity not Mysterious robs the Church dogmas of their irrational and super-rational meaning and accepts the New Testament only in so far as it contains rational religion. Thus he paves the way for his particular view of Judaism. Together with Spinoza, he looks at the Law as the characteristic feature of Judaism. But this does not transform Judaism for him into a lower form of belief which had not yet reached the level of reason. Unfettered by Church dogma he refuses to see in Judaism the precursor of Christianity, with Judaism yielding its place to the new faith, as had been taught by the Church. Together with Mendelssohn, he holds that Juda ism received its character from the Law, the "revealed Law" of ' Cf. Cassierer, E. Philosophie der Aufklàrung, p. 244 f.</page><page sequence="28">242 MAX WIENER [28] Mendelssohn. But while Mendelssohn teaches that the Torah did not intend to give expression to rational belief, because it pre supposes such belief, Toland held that Judaism, as taught by the Torah,Torah, was the historical expression of rational religious theory. Within Judaism, this meant rational religion plus the Law which, according to the testimony of the gospels, is eternally binding for the Jews. Christianity is nothing but Judaism without the specific ritual Law. This Law retained its full validity for the Jews even after the appearance of Christ, except for certain limitations with regard to sacrifices. It assured the continued existence of the Jews and shall, according to the opinion of Spinoza, continue in that function. According to the "economy of the gospels" this continued existence did not mean that a Church, which claimed to be the sole possessor of the whole truth, should shine the brighter against the dark background of the Synagogue. On the contrary, the Jewish faith is equal to the Christian, and there is no higher authority which can permit the Jews to give up their religion• True tolerance opposes any type of enforced uniformity. His torically seen, Christ does not appear as the founder of a new religion, but rather as the link between Judaism and the heathen. It is therefore a complete perversion of the truth to interpret his appearance and his message to mean that Judaism, as con trasted with Christianity, was outmoded.</page></plain_text>
