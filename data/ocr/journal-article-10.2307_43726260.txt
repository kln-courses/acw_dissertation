<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theological Alterations in the Syriac Translation of Ben Sira MICHAEL M. WINTER 1 3 Foxham Road London, N19 4RR England In 1977 I published the first results of my research on the translation of Ben Sira from Hebrew into Syriac.1 Internal evidence in the Syriac version indicates that it was a two-stage process and that the authors of those stages betray their identity by alterations to the Hebrew that are so numerous and clear that they must have been deliberate.2 I identified some forty major alterations and half a dozen minor changes. I use the word "alterations" advisedly because these instances are so clear that they cannot be dismissed as paraphrases. The Syriac translation does indeed have many paraphrases where one assumes that the translator had a less- than-perfect grasp of Hebrew and resorted to paraphrase when not being sure of the meaning of a Hebrew word or phrase. Yet the changes I have identified are in a dif- ferent category; it is clear that the original meaning was understood and altered. 1 Michael M. Winter, "The Origins of Ben Sira in Syriac," VT21 (1977) 237-53, 494-507. 2 In the modern period, the Hebrew text of Ben Sira had been presumed lost until fragmen- tary Hebrew manuscripts were discovered in 1896. When published, these manuscripts were des- ignated by the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. Manuscript B has important variants written in its margin (designated Bm). Other fragments were subsequently discovered at Qumran and Masada (desig- nated 2Q18, 1 lQPsa [1 1Q5], and Mlh). Just over two-thirds of the Hebrew original has been recov- ered. In the present article I have made use of the following printed editions. For the Hebrew, Pancratius C. Beentjes, The Book of Ben Sira in Hebrew: A Text Edition of All Extant Hebrew Man- uscripts and a Synopsis of All Parallel Ben Sira Texts (VTSup 68; Leiden: Brill, 1997).

This is most readily accounted for by the hypothesis that one set of alterations entered the text in the initial translation from Hebrew, whereas the second set was introduced when the translation was comprehensively revised for inclusion in the Peshitta. Quali- tatively, the two sets of modifications are distinct, and each has its own theologi- cal perspective. Detailed examination of the alterations strongly suggests that the first translation was made by an adherent of the Ebionite sect, and the compre- hensive revision points clearly to orthodox Christians in the aftermath of the Arian crisis. Over the years these conclusions have been generally accepted by the stan- dard authors.3 Subsequent research, which I undertook from another perspective, has indi- rectly confirmed my original conclusions and has also yielded some unexpected results, all of which I set out in the present article. It may be useful to say a brief word about the Ebionites.4 Initially they were Christian converts from Judaism who continued to observe large parts of their erst- while Jewish practices. Their presence in Syria and other parts of the Near East in the fourth century and earlier is amply documented in the historical and patristic writings of that period. Although they accepted the main tenets of Christianity, they spoke of Jesus as the new Moses and the true prophet. Their positive charac- teriestics were strict observance of the Mosaic law, vegetarianism, a high regard for poverty, and extreme sensitivity about anthropomorphic ways of speaking of 3 Patrick W.

On the negative side, the Ebionites were hostile to the memory of the Jerusalem temple, strongly opposed to its sacrifices, and disapproved of the kings of Judah and Israel. For the sake of clarity I will divide the newly discovered evidence themati- cally rather than following the order of the chapters in the book. I will turn first to the new evidence that confirms the Ebionite identity of the original translator. I. Ebionite Influence My recent research has brought to light only one such piece of evidence, in Sir 46: 10, over and above those that I published in 1977. The passage treats Caleb, who is loyal to Yhwh and who with Joshua leads the people into the promised land. ™ nnx vbtb aro -o n psr snr ta [ ]i So that all the seed of Jacob might know that it is good to fulfill after Yhwh. The Greek follows it closely, except for "to go after the Lord," indicating per- haps some puzzlement about the Hebrew verb: ottox; eiôtoaiv Ttávreç oi u io! IapaiļX ori KaXòv to TtopeúeaOai òníao) Kupíou So that all the sons of Israel might see that it is good to go after the Lord. The Syriac is different - sufficiently so to suggest a deliberate alteration: .»c73Qi»:tG rťoArťn cnooceai cnii' ^:u:' So that the seed of Jacob might know that they should keep the Law of God and his judgments. This alteration may have been prompted by the uncertainty of translating the Hebrew xta1?, and the translator seems to have been at pains to make it clear that fulfilling the law is what ought to be understood. Whatever the immediate cause, the alteration is consistent with the respect for the law of God, which was charac- teristic of the Ebionites. Taken on its own, this passage does not have great probative value, but considered in connection with more than thirty Ebionite alter- ations that I identified in my previous research, I feel that this passage should also be considered an alteration produced by the Ebionite translator.</page><page sequence="4">THE SYRIAC TRANSLATION OF BEN SIRA 303 II. Orthodox Christian Alterations In my earlier research, I identified another set of alterations in the Syriac ver- sion of Ben Sira, whose characteristics could best be accounted for on the assump- tion that they were made by an orthodox Christian. I also suggested that the most likely Sitz im Leben for those alterations was the revision of the Syriac translation for its inclusion in the Peshitta, which was strongly influenced by the LXX that the early Christians had adopted as their own Bible. Among this group of texts, the clearest evidence of a Christian hand is in 39:34, which appears within a discussion that all created things are good. The text is well preserved in ms B, and the marginal variants do not alter the sense. (Bm htö) nr na sn ht idíò (Bm px) (Bm inr) Tnr iriyn ton -o There is no saying that this is worse than this, for he strengthens everything in its time. The Greek follows the Hebrew closely: Kal oÙK £QT iv eiTielv toOto toútou noviļ póxepov, Ttdvra yap èv Kcupã) £i&gt;0OKi[ir|0iļa£Tai And there is no saying this is worse than this, for all will be approved in (their) time. The Syriac is different: r6m T»n iťicn varťn àft-Ao rť' Jlarćzi There is no saying this is worse than this, because all of them are gathered into barns, and on the occasion of their time they are strengthened. The inserted middle line is a clear echo of the parable of the wheat and the weeds in Matt 13:30, where Jesus says of the wheat sheaves "Gather them [note the plu- ral] into my barns" ( _^or¿ qt^). Since the Hebrew pronouns are in the masculine form, the verse could be interpreted of human beings, in which case the motive for the alteration could have been to elucidate the Hebrew phrase "in its [or his] time." What time? The last judgment? The Syriac translator clearly wishes it to be understood as the last judgment. This is clearly a Christian alteration - made by orthodox Christians. There is nothing distinctive of the Ebionites in it.</page><page sequence="5">304 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 70, 2008 Another Christian alteration, but somewhat disedifying, is found in 37:25. Hebrew: 190» T»K W (ms D) D57 "m (ms fi) The life of the people of Israel is days without number. The Greek follows it reasonably closely: Kal ai fļļiepai roti Iapar|X àvapí0|ir|Toi and the days of Israel (are) without number. The Syriac omits the line altogether. This is a strong indication of a Christian alteration. Its anti-Semitic implication rules out the Ebionites and points to the mainstream orthodox Christians, who at that period were already displaying anti- Semitic sentiments. The next alteration to the text to be considered occurs in 4:22 , where the pas- sage in question has been preserved in two Hebrew manuscripts (mss A and C). The slight differences do not affect the argument. Hebrew (MS C): 1*7 Winn mn *7K (ms A): bunn -pas mn bx Show no favoritism to yourself, and let no one shame you to your own downfall. The Greek follows the Hebrew literally, even retaining the Semitic turns of phrase "take the face" (i.e., favoritism) and " your soul" (i.e., yourself): ļif) Xaßr1&lt;; TipÓGCüTtov Kata trjc; '| 'vyfic, aou Kal ļ ir) ¿VTpa7tfļ&lt;; eie; TtTcoaív oov Show no favoritism to yourself, and do not be ashamed in your fall. Syriac: c'_»:'cczA àvcnia&amp;Y vytÄA Show no favoritism to yourself, and do not be ashamed to confess your stumbling (i.e., sin). The Greek and Hebrew are identical, and so is the Syriac for the first part. This dif- ference in the second clause strongly suggests a deliberate alteration. The injunc- tion about the confession of sins has unmistakable overtones of Christian theology. The next piece of evidence, in 14:16, requires a minor emendation of the Hebrew text, but this does not affect the substance of the argument. Hebrew: mvn Wprfr VlKWn T»K *0 pm nti? in</page><page sequence="6">THE SYRIAC TRANSLATION OF BEN SIRA 305 Israel Levi suggests an emendation for the second and third words, which are almost meaningless in the context.5 He would remove them and replace them with npl, which seems to have been the text that was before the Greek and Syriac trans- lators. This renders the text intelligible: Give and receive and pamper yourself, because in Sheol there is no pursuing luxury. Greek: Sòç Kal Xaße Kal aTtaTiļaov tfļv vļ/uxiļv oov öti oùk ëativ èv aôou OļTfjaai rpucpiļv Give and take and pamper yourself, because in Hades there is no pursuit of luxury. The Syriac is notably different: nCY&gt;o .am Give and take and nourish yourself, and everything that is good to do, do it before God. The sedulous avoidance of the statement that the afterlife is without happiness is theologically significant. Moreover, the general injunction to perform everything that is good is effectively a summary of Phil 4:8: "Finally, brothers, fill your minds with everything that is true, everything that is noble, everything that is good. . . . Keep doing all the things that you learned from me Then the God of peace will be with you." It can probably be classified as an alteration from mainstream Chris- tianity. Next I consider 15:15. The first half of this verse is essentially the same in the three languages; it is in the second half where differences appear: mxa lawn rann DK um nwiï nnnni (ms A) ļin nwih htiöki (ms E) If you desire, you will observe his law, and [it is] prudence to do his will (MS A) and [it is] fidelity to do the will of God (MS B). The Greek is almost the same, with one slight variant in the second part, èàv 0éXi1c; auvTiļpiļasK; èvtoXàç Kal túcjtiv Ttoiřjaai euôoKÍaç If you wish, you will observe the laws and faith to do the will. 5 Israel Levi, The Hebrew Text of the Book ofEcclesiasticus (Semitic Studies Series; Leiden: Brill, 1904) 22.</page><page sequence="7">306 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 70,2008 Syriac: Kir** om jcncaWoâ rdb^.àv vrť If you desire, you will keep his commands, and if you believe in him also you will live. This would seem to be a Christian alteration. Admittedly, the two Hebrew forms and the slight difference in Greek indicate that the Hebrew manuscripts were not uniform at this point. The difference in Syriac, however, is too great to be acci- dental and must be judged to be deliberate. There is a close connection between faith and life in the NT, especially in the Fourth Gospel. For example, John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life"; John 1 1 :25: "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live'"; John 20:31: "These things are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name." On reflection, this should be regarded as a Christian alteration. By contrast, the next significant alteration is about death. It occurs in 41:4 (in ms B, with variants in Bm and Masada). The overall context of this section is about death. Hebrew: [ mim OK&amp;D ITO p*?n HT □"n *?[ ]m mrain (Bm px) wx uzwi nxa mv WW ]1 HNtt imh (Masada) From God this is the portion of all flesh. Why then should you reject the law of the Most High? Whether one has lived ten years or a hundred or a thousand, in Sheol there are no arguments about life. The Greek follows the Hebrew closely: touto to Kpiļia Ttapà ku pí ou naarļ aapKÍ Kal tí aTtavaivrļ èv eùôoKia U'ļ/i(JTOU; £ÏT£ ÔéKa £ÏT£ £KCITÒV £ÏT£ )(i'l Cl £TÎ1 OUK £GTIV £V aôOU L'ey[lÒÇ, Çwrjç This is the decree from the Lord for all flesh. Why then should you reject the will of the Most High? Whether one has lived ten years or a hundred or a thousand, in Hades there is no argu- ment about life. The Syriac condensation is so different that it must be regarded as a deliber- ate alteration: rćcrArć r^riin vocnl^:i K'àtvix» _»oo rťacm Because this is the end of all sons of men before God.</page><page sequence="8">THE SYRIAC TRANSLATION OF BEN SIRA 307 For the preceding and subsequent verses, the Syriac translation is literal and not a paraphrase, which indicates that the translator had the full Hebrew text. The curt truncation therefore indicates a deliberate alteration. The overall context is about death, and the Syriac alteration is best accounted for as a Christian desire to avoid any implication that there is no life after death. The possibility of life after death seems to have influenced the next alteration, 3:1. Unfortunately, it is a place where the Hebrew text has not survived and we are left with the Greek and Syriac translations presenting a significantly different mes- sage. Greek: èXeyiiòv naxpòq cucouaate, téicva, Kal oírrioç Ttoiiļacrre, ïva aa)0f)te Children, pay heed to a father's reproof and act thus so that you may be saved. Syriac: GATING oxzax r^cnrar^X ^»3 r¿xM vG*»àtv:t Children, listen then to the fathers and act (thus) because you will live the life of the ages. This alteration suggests that the Syriac translator wished to emphasize that the sal- vation in question is not in this world but in the world of eternity. This displays a more sophisticated concept of the afterlife and personal immortality. If one views this change in conjunction with the numerous other Christian alterations in the act of translating the Hebrew into Syriac (or revising it), one can conclude that it is likely to be a Christian alteration. In the absence of the original Hebrew, however, one cannot be certain. Echoes of Luke's Gospel can be detected in the next passage, 12:3, but the dif- ference is not sufficiently clear to rate this change as more than a probable alter- ation. The three languages differ notably. Hebrew: nwy ÌÒ npix mi yun ntó mio TN There is no goodness to refresh the wicked, and moreover he has not done a righteous deed. Greek: oùk ëariv àya0à rã) èvôeXexíÇovti eie; Kam Kal tü&gt; èXer|[ioaúvr|v ļifļ XapiÇofiévq) There is no goodness to the one who perseveres in badness and who does not give alms.</page><page sequence="9">308 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 70,2008 Syriac: r^Tt-A àru' iacea rò. r¿ai.:u' ins a There is no goodness to him who honors the wicked, and he who does a righteous deed will not lose out. It seems that the Syriac translator was faced with a Hebrew text that was basically the same as that which survives today, on account of the word HplX ("righteous deed") in the second line. Clearly, some editing has been done to avoid the exces- sively pessimistic tone of the Hebrew, and the result in Syriac is reminiscent of an injunction in Matt 10:42: "And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward." It is probably a Christian alteration. III. Essene Influence? These next anomalies in the Syriac version are quite extraordinary. They are so clear as to be unmistakable alterations, and they too bear a clear theological imprint. The first of them is in 1 1 :7. The context is an uncomplicated exhortation to the kind of behavior that can promote harmony among acquaintances. The Hebrew, preserved in only one manuscript (ms A), can be rendered thus: nnn inai dmd1? npn ^ori [ ]prm tnm Before investigating, find no fault; examine first, then criticize. This is followed closely by the Greek: Ttplv ¿ŠETaaiļc; [if] ļi£ļi'ļ/n* vorļaov Ttpãnrov Kal tòte ¿7iiTÍ(ia Before you investigate, do not find fault. Consider first and then reprove. The Syriac version, however, has an enigmatic alteration that is so different that it could not possibly have been anything as innocuous as a paraphrase or a misunderstanding of the Hebrew. It is a theologically motivated change: a -is TrtocA -ms rò. rć a=&gt;&amp;v rć' Until you examine, do not have intercourse; investigate first of all and then make the marriage. The rare verb à&amp;vg&amp;ix&amp;v is used for marital relations, as in Matt 1 : 1 8. 6 The last word in the line, r^rut, is also used of marriage.7 The standard commentators offer 6 Carl Brockelmann, Lexicon Syriacum (Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard, 1895) 371a. 7 Ibid., 366b.</page><page sequence="10">THE SYRIAC TRANSLATION OF BEN SIRA 309 no explanation for this enigmatic alteration. Rudolf Smend discusses the passage, but he makes no mention of the Syriac version offering advice about a pre-marriage test.8 Patrick W. Skehan and Alexander A. Di Lella state that at this point the Syr- iac version concerns caution in the choice of a marriage partner, but they offer no further elucidation.9 There is no parallel to this peculiar injunction in the Bible. The most probable source for the idea is to be found in Essene thought. There is no reference to this particular matter in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but the crucial information comes from Josephus in th q Jewish War (2.8.13 §§160, 161). I quote from the translation of Todd S. Beali:10 Now there is another order of Essenes, who have the same views as the rest in their way of life, customs, and laws, but are at variance in their opinion of marriage. For they think that those who do not marry cut off the most important part of life, namely, genealogical succession; and further, if all were to hold the same opinion, the whole race would die out very quickly. They put their wives to the test, however, for a three- year period, and marry those who, having three periods of purification give proof that they are able to bear children. They do not have intercourse with them during preg- nancy, demonstrating that they marry not for self-gratification but for the necessity of children. In the baths the women are covered with a garment, whereas the men wear a loin cloth. Such are the customs of this order. The mention of a three-year period of testing prior to marriage has caused prob- lems to translators and commentators alike. In spite of their difficulty, the Greek words are perfectly clear: ÔOKi1iáÇovT8&lt;; (iévToi rpeiría tac; èneiSàv tpiç KaOaptòaiv eu; Ttelpav tou ôúvaaOai tíkteiv, oimoç aycoxai. The puzzling sentence occurs in all the manuscripts, although it must be remem- bered that none of them is earlier than the eleventh century. Various explanations have been offered. H. St. J. Thackeray declared, "The text can hardly be right; the Lat. has ' constanti purgatione.'"11 It seems to me more likely that the Latin trans- lator, faced with this puzzling text, altered it in translation so as to yield an intel- ligible meaning. Alfred Adam makes the same remark about the Latin and adds that the Slavic translation renders the phrase as "mit allerlei Reinheiten," that is, "with various purifications."12 Faced with the same difficulty, André Dupont-Sommer 8 Rudolf Smend, Die Weisheit des Jesus Sirach (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1906) 104. 9 Skehan and Di Lella, Wisdom of Ben Sira, 237. 10 Todd S.

The most recent commentator that I can find offers no further elucidation. Eileen Schuller, a collaborator in the Leiden anniversary volume, translates the passage as: "when they had purified themselves three times," which she interprets as "after they had three menstrual periods."14 She offers no further comment, nor does she explain her implicit alteration of the Greek. I would like to hazard a tentative explanation. The reference to three purifi- cations is probably a combination of universal biologial experience concerning the time after which a young woman is capable of conceiving a child, namely, some time after menstruation has commenced. The Essenes seem to have added a fur- ther, totally unscientific and superstitious precaution of a three-year moratorium, perhaps to ensure success in the undertaking. Such examples of folk wisdom are widespread among prescientific cultures and still have their adherents to this day. The elucidation of this puzzling sentence does not affect its significance in the context of this article, in which I am at pains to identify the source of the change in the Syriac translation. Concerning the origin of this particular alteration in Ben Sira, I think that one can confidently ascribe it to the Essenes, which implies that one of their number, or somebody greatly influenced by their outlook, had a hand in the Syriac transla- tion. The next anomalous alteration occurs in 22: 1 8. The Hebrew does not survive, and the Syriac makes a significant and deliberate addition to the wording preserved in the Greek.

Thus the heart of the fool, victim of his emotions (literally, "intestines"), cannot stand before sorrow. The reference to linen and wool comes from Deut 22: 1 1 : "you must not wear cloth- ing woven part of wool, part of linen." Skehan and Di Lella do not discuss the Syriac addition at this point. Smend does mention it and notes that the Sahidic and Ethiopian versions have variants at this point.15 He suggests that the Syriac addi- tion arose from a confusion between the Hebrew word for purse ("THX) and the word for wool 0^2). I find this explanation unconvincing. There are several possible sources that might yield elucidation. I checked Frederick Field's edition of the Hexaplaric fragments, but at this point (Deut 22: 1 1) there is no variant; nor is there from Symmachus. Philo (Spec. 4.207 [LCL], com- menting on Deut 22:11) mentions the regulation but adds nothing to indicate a symbolic meaning that might illuminate this text. Mention of wool and linen occurs in the Qumran writings, however, in a doc- ument that is an original sapiential work, preserved in seven fragmentary manu- scripts: one from cave 1 and six from cave 4. Geza Vermes states that it is undoubtedly Essene in character because it displays terminology akin to the Com- munity Rule. The fragment that contains the relevant words about wool and linen is 4Q41 8 frag. 103 col. ii. Vermes translates, "Why should it be a mixture like a mule, and you should be like one dres[sed in mixed materials], in wool and in linen."16 This tiny fragment is too small to contain any context that might illustrate further the significance of the prohibition. One thing is clear, however: the prohibition was of interest to the Essenes. Writing in 1995, Torlief Elgvin stated that six copies of the work display an early Herodian script, and one (4Q23) is in a late Herodian hand (1-50 C.E.). He observed, "The large number of copies and the fact that the book was copied until a late stage in the history of the Qumran settlement shows that it 15 Smend, Weisheit des Jesus Sirach, 200. 16 Geza Vermes, The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (New York: Penguin, 1997) 402, 411.</page><page sequence="13">312 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 70,2008 was highly regarded within the Essene Community."17 Writing a couple of years later, the same author suggested that the document may have originated among those scholars who produced the early Enochic books.18 It is possible that the iden- tity of the author or authors will never be decided definitively, but that is not of immediate concern to the inquiry of this article. What is relevant is the fact that the Qumran community considered it to be important. In the 1997 publication, Elgvin restated his former conclusion: "The presence of seven copies of 4QInstruction from the Herodian period ... in the Qumran caves points to the importance the sec- tarian community ascribed to this work. It was probably transmitted as an impor- tant writing of the sect's precursors, and influenced sectarian thinking to a large degree."19 The presence of two clear alterations in the Syriac version of Ben Sira that bear the imprint of Essene influence gives rise to a considerable problem. After the destruction of the Qumran monastery in the First Jewish War (66-70 C.E.), the Essenes vanished from history and were heard of no more. How, then, are we to account for the presence in Ben Sira of alterations that are best explained as the result of Essene influence? The most satisfactory explanation would seem to be a return to the hypothe- sis of Oscar Cullmann. Half a century ago he put forward the theory, viewed favor- ably by a number of other scholars, that the Ebionites were converted Essenes.20 If Cullmann's theory is correct (and my own findings have provided an unexpected and independent confirmation of it), we have an explanation of the phenomenon. After the Essenes disappeared from the pages of history, some of their ideas were incubated (if one may use that expression) in the patrimony of the Ebionites, among whom there emerged the scholar who translated Ben Sira into Syriac. Thus, the Essene ideas and influences have come into the Syriac version of Ben Sira, in spite of the fact that they flourished at a time well before Christianity's penetration into Syria, which prompted the Syriac version of the Bible. The changes to the text in its passage from Hebrew to the Peshitta that I have discussed here confirm my original conclusions arrived at in 1977, namely, that Ben Sira was first translated by an Ebionite and was then revised by a mainstream orthodox Christian for its inclusion in the Peshitta. 17 Torlief Elgvin, "The Reconstruction of Sapiential Work A," RevQ 16 (1995) 559-80, here 559. 18 Torlief Elgvin, "Wisdom and Apocalypticism in the Early Second Century b.c.: The Evi- dence of 4QInstruction," in The Dead Sea Scrolls Fifty Years after Their Discovery: Proceedings of the Jerusalem Congress, July 20-25, 1997 (ed.
