<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. By PROFESSOR A. W. VAN BUREN. There are published 1 several examples of a bronze medallion of Antoninus Pius, dated A.D. I40-144, with the following reverse (fig. 33): FIG. 33. MIEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS IN THE BRITISH MIUSEUMI (p. I87). AESCVLAPIVS in exergue. Ship to right under arched structure; one man is visible on ship ; at prow, serpent springing to right; to right, river-god facing left with right hand extended in greeting; above him, indications of rocks; above them, three buildings and a tree. The casual observer would naturally interpret the scene as follows: " From under a bridge comes a ship in motion, from the prow of which a serpent leaps to the land; a river-god greets him; the inscription AESCVLAPIVS identifies the scene as the arrival of the sacred snake of Aesculapius at the Insula Tiberina, the Insula Tiberina being represented to the right, and a bridge across the Tiber (Pons Aemilius2?) to the left; the river-god being the Tiber." 1 Obverse and reverse: Cohen, ed. 2, Antonin 17, i8 (on C's illustrations, see Dressel, cited below, 32, Anm.

However, to attribute avoidance of anachronism to the art of the Antonine period is in my opinion itself a pronounced anachronism. The idea of historical accuracy in architecture, costume, etc. was as foreign to art in that epoch as it has been in every other age down to the nineteenth century. And Professor Hulsen tacitly admits this when he interprets the arched structure to the left of our medallion as a navale of the early third century B.C; for, difficult as it is to imagine a navale of any considerable size constructed according to the indications on the medallion, in any age, it will be recognised as obvious that Rome of the period in question possessed no large arcuated structures which can be adduced as parallels, quite apart from the problem of the roof, to which I shall have occasion to revert later.</page><page sequence="2">I88 A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. To this interpretation, Dr. H. Dressel, carrying further the discussion of the medallion begun by Professor Chr. Htilsen1, has formulated the following objections2: The structure to the left is not a bridge but a navale; the ship is not in motion but at rest; the land to the right is not the Insula Tiberina, being represented by the artist as an eminence, wooded, fortified, and inhabited; therefore it is the Aventine, the view is taken from the left bank of the Tiber, and the Insula Tiberina is not represented, but left to the imagination of the spectator. The arguments, which I have given above in a very condensed form, appear at first sight unanswerable as stated in the original. Nevertheless, the perusal of Dr. Dressel's article left me with the feeling, which not even my deep respect for the author's erudition and judgment was able to overcome, that his interpretation, ingenious as it is, involves violence to the obvious signification of the medallion ; and that to read into the representation a topo- graphical significance not obvious on the surface was derogatory to the skill of the artist, and therefore not to be acquiesced in without the most rigid scrutiny. A similar feeling prompted the observations of Petersen3 and Richter4 who, although not bringing the matter to a definite solution 5, still did much to show the difficulties inherent in Huilsen's and Dressel's interpretation. My own investigations, from an independent point of view, have led me partly along lines of reasoning similar to those followed by Petersen and Richter, although in a different context, and in part they have brought to my attention certain other matters which seemed of interest, both as bearing on the question directly at issue, and also in their relation to more general aspects of Roman imperial art. This will, I trust, be considered sufficient reason for my presenting to others the results of my study of this medallion. It will be convenient first to discuss Dr. Dressel's arguments in their inverse order. " The land to the right is inhabited." That the artist might not have thought of the Insula Tiberina as inhabited, it is difficult to believe. Surely he had no idea of striving for strict historical accuracy; in his own day the island presumably contained various heterogeneous structures more or less dependent on the shrines which we know were there, and this would have justified him in representing some heterogeneous buildings on the island.

Hill, have placed me under obligation to them by their kindness in discussing the original draft of my manuscript. Dr. Dressel's and Professor Hiulsen's courtesy in the matter is all the more appreciated, as they do not find the considerations here advanced to be convincing. 3 Rom.

I44, Anm. 79) characterises their arguments as " nicht uiberzeugend."</page><page sequence="3">A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. 189 matter of fact, the structures to the right of our medallion are extremely similar to some which are found in the idyllic scenery on the stucco reliefs from the Villa Farnesina 1 there is the same tree appearing from behind the same tower; there is the same sacellum-like structure, with wide aperture and pediment. They appear, in fact, to be part of the traditional landscape motives of Graeco-Roman art. They may well have been intended to suggest sacred buildings and appurtenances to shrines, rather than private dwellings. " It is fortified." That the tower in itself does not imply fortification, and that the other buildings are not military in character, will result from comparison with the stucco relief from the Villa Farnesina already cited 2. " It is wooded." The one tree represented need not neces- sarily imply a forest ; we have already seen that it is part of the traditional idyllic landscape. Although there is no documentary evidence for the existence of trees on the Insula Tiberina in antiquity, there may well have been a few, and in fact they would have been quite in place in the sanctuary of Aesculapius. " It is a mountain." It will of course be recognised that the masses of rock extending over the personified river god have a certain resemblance, not, however, an exact one, to the representations of mountains in several monetary series, chiefly of the first three centuries of the empire, and of the Greek mainland, Asia Minor, Anatolia, and Syria. 3 But closer examination shows that there is a radical difference between the raison d'etre of the mountains in the series referred to, and the " Aventine " on our medallion. Here, according to Dr. Dressel's explanation, the " Aventine " is an accessory, introduced perhaps for the sake of picturesqueness, or in order to serve as an additional indication of the topography, but certainly not essential to the situation depicted. Whereas in almost all of the instances referred to, the mountain was demonstrably a sacred 1 Mon. dell' Inist. suppi. tav. xxxii-xxxv; Lessing u.

I know of no instance in antiquity where a mountain was represented on a coin for mere picturesque effect or to introduce additional but non-essential topographical detail. I The objection, however, which I have advanced, to considering the buildings to the right as placed on an eminence, is not cogent in the present instance, and for an important reason: our medallion, and the series to which it belongs, are artistically more closely akin to relief sculpture than to the typical coinage of antiquity; and the representations on these Antonine medallions are not to be judged by the canons of the die-cutter, but rather by those of the relief FIG. 34. MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS IN THE CABINET DES MEDAILLES, PARIS (p. 191). sculptor. It may well be, as M\ir. G. F. Hill has suggested to me, that not only our medallion and the series to which it more immediately belongs, but also many other coin-types of the imperial period both in Rome and in the provinces (one thinks naturally of the series of Ilium) are not original creations, but are derived from some relief or even some painting. Certainly some of the striking characteristics of the Hadrian and Antonine medallions find their most obvious explanation in some such hypothesis. This being so, one could fairly adduce as parallels the shrine on a hill on the Ara Pacis Aug. 2 (where, as it happens, what would have been the lower 1 B. MI. Cat.

I9I part of the hill was left flat to secure a background for part of the main scene, thus causing a striking resemblance to our medallion), and certain representations of hills on the Trajan and Antonine Columns. There is, however, a more serious difficulty in the interpretation of the locality in question as an eminence: and this lies in the fact FIG. 35. DENARIUS OF ANTONINUS PIUS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM (p. 191). that the masses of rock above the river-god may well have another signification. This will become apparent from the scrutiny of three other coins, which, having been struck under the same emperor, and likewise representing episodes in earlier Roman history, are peculiarly apposite in this connexion. On a bronze medallion (Cohen, 2nd ed. ii, Antonin, I i6i FIG. 36. MNIEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS IN THE CABINET DES MEDAILLES, PARIS (p. I92). fig. 34), showing Hercules receiving the homage of the natives after his slaying of Cacus, the monster's den is indicated by a group of roundish masses representing rocks, extending out over him from one side of the field.' On a denarius (Cohen, 2nd ed. ii, Antonin, 914 (fig. 35); the I It will be remembered that part of the rocky walls had been torn down by Hercules, Verg.

Med. 266), showing the discovery of the wolf and twins by two shepherds, the wolf's cave is represented by a similar mass of rocks, extended in a semi-circle over the wolf and twins. In these two instances there is no room for doubt: a cave and nothing more is represented ; the artist is not concerned with suggesting the height of the ground above. In another bronze medallion (Cohen, 2nd ed. ii, Antonin, II7I (fig. 36) however, showing the sow discovered by Aeneas, the sow is in a similar cave, and over it can be seen the buildings of a town; the town, Laurentum, is obviously conceived of as in the background, and the semicircle of rocks above the sow is not intended to suggest that the town is set on a hill. I believe that the case is similar with our medallion. The personified Tiber is at a point where his stream flows beneath the overhanging banks of the island, the question of the geological formation of which would probably have caused no difficulties to the artist ; above him appear the edifices on the island; it was not the artist's intention to suggest high ground. 1 " The structure to the left is not a bridge but a navale." 2 It has been found to differ from representations of bridges in two respects. First, its two extremities, instead of fading off into the margin or the background or meeting the banks, are cut off sharply, as if the structure actually had that form. To this may be replied that there are at least two instances on imperial coins where a wooden bridge is represented terminating abruptly as on our medallion. 3 It may be added that a frequently recurring type on imperial coins, two clasped hands, which regularly terminate abruptly well within the field of the coin, shows that there was nothing repugnant to the taste of the period in this mode of treatment. I For the scene, cf. Trajan Column, Cicorius i i Col. of M. Aurelius, Petersen, etc. taf. 9. 2 As Hiulsen and Dressel have observed, Valerius Maximus (i, 8, 2) represents the serpent as swimming across the river to the island from the ship which had landed on the mainland. This does not, however, appear to have been the only version of the serpent's advent: Aurelius Victor (Vv. 111. xxii, 3) expressly states, ". . quum adverso Tiberi subveheretur, in proximam insulam desi- luit; " and the narratives in Livy (Per. xi), Ovid (Met. xv, 736-744), Plutarch (Quaest. Rom. 94), and Arnobius (vii, 46), although a scholar having Valerius Maximus's words in mind may interpret them in accordance therewith, certainly in them- selves give no intimation, explicit or implicit, of a landing on the mainland. And even if the artist of our medallion were acquainted with the version represented by Valerius Maximus, one may be permitted to doubt whether he would have been well advised in adopting it for his purpose. That Valerius Maximus, as Professor Hiulsen informs me, is in general a close follower of Livy, and may be assumed here to follow the Livian tradition, does not affect the force of the above. Nor can I, with Professor Hiulsen, demand of the artist a scrupulous regard for the extent of the city at the period of the event depicted. 3 Cohen, 2nd. ed. Trajan, 542 (Donaldson, Architectura Numismatica, no. 62); Cohen, znd ed. Sept. Sev. 522 (Donaldson, op. cit. no. 63). Dr. Dressel writes me concerning these coins: " In beiden Fallen ist nur eine Briucke dargestellt (die Verbindung mit dem Lande darzustellen war also nicht nothwendig)." But on our medallion too, if the structure to the left is interpreted as the Pons Aemilius, neither of the two banks which it connects is represented. The Trajan Column, Cicorius, z6i, may also be quoted.</page><page sequence="7">A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. I93 In the second place, the typical Roman stone bridge (see the illustrations, Daremberg et Saglio, Dictionnaire, s. v. Pons) consisted of a level portion in the centre with a sloping approach at each end. I must admit that the curving top of the structure on the medallion does present a real difficulty; but I do not consider it serious, in comparison with the other elements of the problem. The artist must have been familiar with representations on coins of woodern bridges, e.g. those quoted in note 3, p. I92; the difficulties of fore-shortening and the adaptability of a curving line to that position in the circular field may explain his method of procedure. Moreover, one is beset with far greater difficulty if one endeavours to reconstruct in imagination the sort of navale with curving roof which is posited by those who do not see a bridge in the structure. One must then assume that the number of ship-sheds in the navale has been abbreviated by the artist; and surely a series of six or a dozen, not to say more, of these sheds, each spanned by a barrel- vault, and the whole covered by a huge turtle-back roof, is not only without parallel from antiquity but in itself an architectural monstrosity. 1 So far, we have been concerned with examining the objections brought against what I have ventured to call the obvious interpre- tation of the medallion ; and I believe it has been sufficiently demonstrated that these objections lack in cogency. It now remains to call attention to some features of the medallion which I feel deserve more consideration than they have hitherto received. The serpent certainly appears to be springing to the land at the right: no casual observer would interpret the scene otherwise. And the river god is welcoming the stranger to his new home with an expressive gesture. The artist has done all that was in his power to indicate that this is the situation depicted. But, perhaps uncon- sciously, he has done more than this, and by introducing the figure of the river god he has furnished us with, as I believe, a perfectly 1 The lack of any indication of the rowers in the ship can hardly be considered an insuperable objection. I cannot adduce clear numismatic examples of ships in motion with oars and with no rowers represented; but in painting and mosaic there are at least two instances (Praenestine mosaic Rom. Mitt. xxvi (1911), abb. 34, and Herculanean painting, ibid. abb. 58) of war-ships in which the rowers are concealed, and only the fighting men and officers are visible; and the same may be true of many coins where the small scale makes a distinc- tion impossible. Compare also the high screen along the side of the ship in the relief in the Palazzo Spada, Papers of the British School at Rome, v, pl. 2 1; although there one cannot be sure that the rowers are in position: Cf. Plutarch, Ant. Ixiii. Nor does the undue shortness of the ship resulting from the assumption that the figure to the left is the hortator seem to me a serious consideration; the aplustre may be imagined as concealed by the pier of the bridge. The position of the oars in the water cannot be used as an argument: on the Trajan Column (Cicorius, T18, 119, 217, 218, 225) ships are re- presented with the crew not at the oars, and yet with the oars in the same position as on our medal- lion: Cf. Plutarch, Ant. lxiii. Nor is it permissible to draw conclusions from the way in which the waves are represented on the medallion, as to the direction in which the river is flowing: a glance at the Trajan Column, Cicorius, 225-229, will show that the art of the period was not always accurate in the representation of waves; one would naturally take the waves in 225 to be flowing to the right, and those in 229 to be flowing to the left, yet obviously the same stream is represented in both instances.</page><page sequence="8">194 A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. reliable means of determining the orientation of the whole scene. In Roman art, there are two ways of representing a personified river: either the god is reclining, and to the downward slope of his outstretched form corresponds the flow of a miniature stream issuing from an urn or a rock near his elbow 1 or else, in a much smaller number' of instances, he is swimming with his stream or floating in it ; and then he always faces in the same direction in which the stream is flowing,2 never, so far as I have observed, in the opposite direction. I do not think that the artist could possibly have conceived of the river god as swimming or even facing in a direction other than that followed by the course of the current, for in his mind the god is the river, and his existence and activity are not to be separated from those of his stream. 3 1 In the vast majority of cases, the god's head is turned towards his feet, i.e. he is looking in the same direction in which the stream is flowing (e.g. Cohen, znd ed. Adrien, III3, Antonin, 817, 8zo (Hirsch Kat. xxiv, ii, 1537); B. M. Cat. Phrygia, passim); there are, however, instances in which (probably from the artist's desire to vary somewhat the monotony of the conventional type, or, in the case of monumental sculpture, from considerations having to do with the surroundings in which the work eventually was to be placed) the head is turned in the opposite direction; e.g. B. M. Cat. Phrygia, p. 197, Doryla-eum, ii; Arch of Trajan at Beneventum, Frothingham, Cat. of Casts, no. I 9; Nile of the Vatican, Amelung, Die Sculpturen d. Vat. Museums, i, no. Iog. When two rivers are represented, with their streams meeting (e.g. Cohen, 2nd ed. Lucius V6rus, 348, Alex. Sev. 446, Gordien le Pieux, I72, Gallien, 224, Probus, 635), a strict topographical significance seems to be always present: either one river is. a tributary of the other, or they both flow into the same sea. 2 I have noted the following instances: The Tyche of Antioch (cf. the observations of E. Gardner, Handbook of Greek Sculpture, p. 446); Cohen, 2nd ed. Nero, 37 (Macdonald, Coin Types, pl. viii, 8), of special interest as the Tiber is repre- sented at the point where the canal of Claudius flowed into the harbour of Portus, 39 (similar); Trajan Column, Cicorius, scene I ; Column of M. Aurelius, Petersen, etc. taf. ix. 'True, as I have stated above, there are instances of the reclining river god's having his head averted from the course of his stream. But this is because the reclining god personifies the river conceived of as stable-as a topographically fixed object; and it is sufficient if the slope of his form is parallel to the descent of the stream, having provided for which requirement the artist feels at liberty, if he chooses, to treat the figure as purely anthropomorphic; he not only can turn the god's head away from the course of the stream, but can place in his hand a boat (e.g. Cohen znd ed. Antonin, 817, Marc. Aurele, 383), which considerations for topographical symbolism would surely have required to be placed in the stream itself (like the fish on the coin, B. M. Cat. Phrygia, p. 2I4, Eumeneia, 26); but which is treated purely as an attribute, like the gubernaculum of Fortuna. Cf. the similar treatment, Cohen, 2nd ed. Adrien, 1I09. It is perhaps difficult for the modern man to attain to a sympathetic or at least receptive frame of mind toward this concept of the personification of geographical entities; and yet, that it was deeply rooted in the psychology of the ancients, no one familiar with the monuments and the authors can deny. The Zeus of Aetna, as he appears on a tetradrachm of Hiero's colony (Hill, Coins of Ancient Sicily, pl. iv, I3), enthroned, brandishing aloft a thunderbolt in his left hand, in his right a verdant bough, and at his feet a pine-tree on which an eagle has alighted; and Kimon's facing head of Arethusa (Hill, op. cit. pl. vi, 15), with her undulating, fish-entwined tresses, belong to the realm of poetry quite as much as to that of geography. But with the coming of the Hellenistic age, there is a certain dry pre- cision in the carefully thought-out parallelism between the real object and its anthropomorphised representation, e.g. in the Tyche of Antioch with her crown of towers and with the Orontes at her feet (the influence of which is visible in the repre- sentation of the emperor at Antioch in the Tabula Peutingeriana), and still more in the Nile of the Vatican (Amelung, Die Sculpturen d. Vat. Mus. i, no. I09); though in the Augustan Age an image of Tiberinus, with crown of reeds, and sea-blue cloak, was still able to inspire a poet (Vergil, Aen. viii, 31, ff. cf. Carcopino, Melanges de l'Ecole Fr. de Rome, xxxi (1911 ), I56); and there are few nobler figures in art than the river-gods on the Columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, partaking as they do of much of the grandeur of that strange, half-anthropomorphic, half-elemental figure, the Rain God of the Column of Marcus Aurelius (Petersen, etc. Marcus-Sdule, taf. 23 A, Mrs. Strong, Roman Sculpture, pl. lxxxvii). The subject is not void of interest, as a chapter in the history of the human mind, to which I think attention has not been sufficiently directed; here, however,</page><page sequence="9">A MEDALLION OF ANTONINUS PIUS. 195 If then the god is facing, and his stream is flowing, to the left, then the ship is not resting in a navale, with prow toward the opposite bank, but is coming up-stream toward the Insula Tiberina; and the serpent is leaping, just as he appears to be leaping, directly toward his future abode. Moreover, if we recollect that there is documentary evidence that Tiberinus was worshipped on the Insula Tiberina at the beginning of the empire, 2 we may discern a peculiar fitness in his occupying precisely this position, at the point where his stream went close under the overhanging banks of the island. It may well be that a sacellum of the god was visible, at the period of our medallion, near the spot where the god is represented. 3 ADDENDUM: Since writing the above article, I have seen Com- mendatore Fr. Gnecchi's publication of the medallion in question, in his Medaglioni Romani, Milan, 1912, vol, ii, p. 9, Antonino Pio, I-3. He describes the ship as passing under a bridge, and the three buildings and tree as on a cliff, but does not express an opinion as to the matter of their location. I can allude to it only in so far as a general appre- ciation of the attitude of mind of the ancienits in this regard is of importance for the interpretation of our medallion. In connexion with the passage in Vergil to which I referred above, I may add that it is generally recognised that Vergil was strongly influenced by works of art. To the list of passages to which I called attention in Nun:. Chron. 4th ser. x (I9io), 409, ff. as indicating his acquaintance with certain Magna Grecian and Sicilian coins, may be added one of a somewhat different character, in the description of the shield of Aeneas, Aen. viii, 671-674: " Haec inter tumidi late maris ibat imago auLrea, set fluctu spumabant caerula cano et circum argento clari delphines in orbem aequora verrebant caudis aestumque secabant," where I seem to detect a reminiscence of a Syracusan coin; at least I am at a loss to point out the occurrence of the motive, in the margin of a circular field, elsewhere in ancient art later than the archaic period. It was known to archaic Ionic and Melian (?) art, cf. the great candelabrum of Cortona, Mon. dell' anst. iii, tav. 42, and the steatite gem in the British Museum, Furtwangler, Antike Genmmen, taf. v, 30, Perrot et Chipiez, Hist. de l'art dans l'qntiquiti, vol. ix, fig. 7); and is in fact an adaptation of the flying fish motive, which that art had inherited from the prehistoric Aegean civilization (cf. Tomba della Pesca e della Caccia at Corneto, Mon. dell' instituto, xii, tav. xiv, xiva, with the flying fish fresco fromn Phylakopi, Phyla- kopi, pl. iii), and which, limited however to the dolphin, appears also in the well-known Tarentine monetary series with the dolphin, as well as in the class of monuments attributed by Loewy, Oesterr. Jahresh. xiv (I 9s I), I 6, to a Cretan origin, and in Attic vases of the best period. 2 Fasti Amiternini, Dec. 8 (C. I. L. i, znd ed. p. 245, cf. p. 336. The suggeiston is tempting, that this cult dates from very early times, and that the island received its name, not from itslocation in the stream, but from having been, before the coming of the serpent, sacred to Tiberinus. 3 Cf. Besnier, L'ile Tiberine dans l'antiquiti (Bibl. des Lcoles Fr. 87), p. 309. The relief in the Palazzo Rondinini, Rmo. Mitth. i (1886), taf. 9, may have some connexion with the locality; but the question seems best left open.</page></plain_text>
