<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY AND AFFILIATED SOCIETIES THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON The 763d meeting was held on November 27, 1915, at the Cosmos Club. President Eichelberger in the chair, 42 persons present. The minutes of the 762d meeting were read in abstract and approved. Mr. E. D. Tillyer presented a paper entitled A spectrograph for photographing Etalon rings. A systematic determination of the wave lengths of a spectrum such as the iron arc by means of the Etalon in terference rings requires a spectrograph giving sharp definition along the spectrum lines and not necessarily sharply defined lines. The spectrograph described was intended to be used in the ultra-violet region from about 0.220 ß to 0.320 ß and it was desired to obtain the best possible definition through this region. A true flattening of the field being impossible because of the absence of necessary materials it was decided to use only quartz and rock salt in the optical system and to so proportion the relative powers as to produce a flat though inclined field when used with a 60° rock-salt prism. After setting up the optical equations a solution was obtained which gave the neces sary flatness of field when the collimator was an ordinary quartz-rock salt objective achromatised to reunite X = 0.220 ß to X = 0.320 ß and the camera lens was composed of two-quartz lenses close together and having almost normal field curvatures. The maximum curvature in the hundred millimeters of field is less than a millimeter and could have been further reduced except for the uncertainty of the indices of the materials in thfe ultra-violet region. In practice this spectro graph will give fairly good definition throughout the visible spectrum by a change of adjustment as well as in the region for which it was designed. Mr. H. E. Merwin then spoke on Linear interpolation of wave lengths in spectrograms. That the curve for the spacing of lines on a spectrogram is of the same form as a dispersion curve is shown thus: Let i — angle of incidence on prism, A = angle of prism, n = refractive index of prism, ß = angle between photographic plate and normal to back face of prism, d = distance from line on plate to normal to face of prism; A, B, etc., are constants. Then d = ( A/sin ß) (\/n2 — sin2i — sin i. cot A), or, approximately, d = A (Bn — C) or A (Dn2 = F) or d = (Gn-H) or (Kn2—L). But the dispersion formula is n2 = a+ry— — dX.2 A — C 128</page><page sequence="2">proceedings: philosophical society 129 Then d = M+N ~ . A table of the complex factor, call it n', is easily computed from Barlow's Tables of Squares and Recipro cals if b, c, and d are taken equal to 0.01, as they are approximately for quartz. But the same table of values of n' will fit values of X in creased or decreased by as much as 30 ßß, which is ample to allow three comparison wave-lengths in a spectrogram to be brought into coin cidence with the curve. Other wave-lengths are then interpolated by d = M + Nn.' The paper was discussed by Mr. Burgess. Mr. P. D. Meeica then presented an illustrated paper on Some Metallographie methods. The term metallography connotes in its gen eral sense the study of the structures of metallic substances and the properties of these substances as related to structure; it has often been confused with the microscopic study of metallic substances, which is really only one phase of metallography. Slides were shown to illus trate the crystalline structure and growth of metals and alloys. De fective materials are often to be detected by microscopic examination, such as, for example, the presence of slag or oxide, the application of improper heat treatment, etc. The method of thermal analysis is used to determine the melting points and transformation temperatures of metals and alloys; it has been used to detect the presence of impurities in metallic tin, for example, the presence of 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of zinc. Initial stresses are found in most metallic materials, due to unequal rate of cooling or working; it has been shown that these are often re sponsible for failures of materials, for example, in the case of brass rods and tubes. A method for determining structural identity or differ ence according to Hanemann was described. The theories of plastic deformation of metals were discussed and evidence described bearing upon these theories. In conclusion a plea was made for a fuller de scription of metallic materials used in determinations of constants. The paper was discussed by Messrs. White and Tillyer with reference to methods of getting wire of certain properties for thermo-elements. The 764th regular meeting and 45th annual meeting of the Society was held at the Cosmos Club, December 11, 1915. Vice-President Briggs in the chair ; 33 persons present. The minutes of the 44th Annual Meeting were read. The report of the Secretaries was read by Mr. Fleming, showing an active membership of 149. Sixteen regular meetings have been held. The report was ordered accepted. The Treasurer's report through December 9, 1915, was read by Mr. Sosman. The total receipts for the year were $1075.09; total expenditures, $1420.09, including pur chase of bond of par value $500; total investments, $12,000; cash in hand, $109.72. The report of the Auditing Committee consisting of Messrs. Kimball, Ferner, and Wallis was read by Mr. Kimball. This Committee reported the statements in the Treasurer's report to be correct. The report was ordered accepted and to be filed with that of the Treasurer. The Treasurer's report was ordered accepted.</page><page sequence="3">130 proceedings: anthropological society The following officers were duly elected for the ensuing year: President: L. J. Briggs.

THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON At the 490th meeting of the Society, held November 2, 1915, in the Public Library, Dr. Walter Hough, of the National Museum, spoke on Progress in Anthropology in California. He first discussed the prob lems connected with the populating of California by the Indians, giving a general view of the geographical obstacles and the avenues to the north and south by which migrants entered. The conditions as to food, water, and means of transportation were shown to have greatly influenced the condition and direction of the migrations. A brief review was given of the numerous stocks of Indians in California and attention was called to the similarity, as regards the large number of tribes present, to the Mexican Gulf area studied by Dr. J. R. Swanton. The Pacific Coast was described as a vast ethnic enclave, a veritable swarming place of tribes, whose origin, antecedents, and development in most instances perplex the ethnologist. California presents a most interesting field of study to anthropologists. Californian historians are alive to the value of these studies as a groundwork for history, and the speaker mentioned the work of H. H. Bancroft, Charles F. Lummis, Robert E. Cowan, and others who have contributed valuable work. Progress in museum display of anthropological material was noted and the great collections in San Francisco and Los Angeles described. The speaker found evidence of the increasing growth of civic pride in sustaining the work and adding to the effectiveness of museums. It was said also that the University of California is a force for anthropolog ical science in California, and the intelligent patronage of Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst in this direction was praised since she had made possible the important researches of Dr. -A. L. Kroeber and others and the en riching of a great museum through exploration. An account was given of the work in the more than 400 shell mounds of San Francisco Bay carried on by Gieford, Nelson, and Waterman and of the explorations among the Indian tribes.</page><page sequence="4">proceedings: anthropological society 131 •The two great expositions which California has successfully carried on this year are of great importance to anthropology, especially that at San Diego, where this subject was preeminent, the San Francisco Exposi tion being mainly devoted to modern progress. The anthropological exhibit of the former was prepared by Prof. W. H. Holmes, Dr. Ales Hrdliéka and others of the United States National Museum in coopera tion with Dr. E. L. Hewett, and furnished a superb contribution to the study of man. The speaker said in closing that there is being built up on the West Coast a people of general culture who are appreciative and receptive of the researches of science. It augurs well for the science of anthropology here that it has an alert public which aids in the extension of its activities—a public that demands it and can assimilate its results. At the 491st meeting of the Society, held in the Public Library, December 7, 1915, Francis LaFlesche, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, read a paper entitled Right and left in Osage rites. The Osage, at the formative period of their tribal organization, had arrived at the idea that all life proceeded from the united fructifying powers of two great forces, namely, the sky and the earth. They also perceived in these two forces an inseparable unity by which was made possible the continuity of the life proceeding from them. It was upon these conceptions that they founded their complex gentile organization. They first divided the people into two great divisions, one of which they called Tsi-zhu (household), symbolically representing the sky, and the other, Hon-ga (sacred), representing the earth. These two great symbolic divisions they brought together to form one body which they likened to a living man. He stood facing the east, the left side of his body, the Tsi-zhu division, being to the north, and the right side of his body, the Hon-ga, being to the south. When a war party including men of both the great tribal divisions was being organized, the people pulled down their wigwams and reset them in a ceremonial order, which was in two squares, with a dividing avenue running east and west. In this arrangement the position of the symbolic man was changed so that he faced the west; consequently the right side of his body, the Hon-ga division, was at the north, and the Tsi-zhu divisions, at the south. All the ceremonial movements were made in reference to the right and left sides of the symbolic man, as was also the placing of the symbolic articles used in the ceremonies. The portable shrine has a right and a left side. When the ceremonies of the tribal war rites were being performed, the shrine was put in its place so that the left was toward the Tsi-zhu and the right toward the Hon-ga. When a man was initiated into the mysteries of the war rites, the shrine of his gens was temporarily transferred to his keeping. If he belonged to the Hon-ga division he hung the sacred article at the right side of his door when viewed from within; if he belonged to the Tsi-zhu division, he hung it at the left of his door. A woman for whom a sacred burden-strap had been ceremonially made hung the sacred</page><page sequence="5">132 proceedings: anthropological society article at the right side of her door if she belonged to the Hon-ga division, at the left side if she belonged to the Tsi-zhu division. The observance of right and left pertained to many details connected with the tribal ceremonies and appeared in the daily customs of the people. The paper was discussed by Miss Alice C. Fletcher and Messrs. Hodge, Swanton, Fewkes, Mooney, and Michelson, among others. Similar dualistic concepts regarding right and left or earth and sky as determining social relationships and fundamental modes of con duct were reported as found in widely separated tribes, such as the Hopi of the Southwest and the Piegan of the north. The discussion cen tered largely upon the significance of 7 and 6 as sacred numbers, which are found widely spread in ancient and oriental nations as well as in America. Several members referred the origin of 6 as a sacred or occult number to the six "cardinal points," north, south, east, west, up, and down. The number 7 adds to these the concept of the center between the points. Dr. Fewkes referred at length to his earlier studies of the preference given the left hand in the sacred mysteries of the Zunis and what he has called the "sinistral circuit," which was followed, for instance, in Zuni processions and by anyone approaching the kiva. Some theories account for this significance of the left side by this being the side where fies the heart and the side which sup ports the shield in battle. Miss Fletcher dwelt upon the intellectual and especially the poetic and anthropomorphic character of the con cepts of the Indian thinker who faces nature in the open and feels im pelled to think out and give reasons for things. Is not the sky side, the left in the Osage conception, given the place of honor because of a deep feeling of its religious significance? Daniel Folkmar, Secretary.</page></plain_text>
