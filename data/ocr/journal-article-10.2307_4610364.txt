<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Auto-Beatnik, the Auto-Critic, and the Jstication of Nonsense By ROBERT OLIPHANT * As members of an intellectual community, we in the colleges dwell for the most part in a world of symbols-a world which has a rather close connection with the real world, the visceral world of birth, copulation, and death. The student who weeps over a C on her record, the student whose headache comments on the difficulty of a long reading assignment, the student whose digestion protests the inequities of a take-home examination, the professor who weeps over a C on his record-all testify to the closeness of this connection. But our world of symbols, on the whole, is a comfortable world. We can arrange, we can control the various elements of which it is com- posed, whether they be concepts, Christ-figures, or phonemes. We are, in work and in commerce with one another, "high verbals." We are the elect. We are the singers of songs, the dreamers of dreams, the typers of typescripts. Our society honors us-and we honor ourselves. After all, anyone can learn to manipulate a lawnmower; not everyone can learn to manipulate an idea. As individuals, however, we cannot construct a private world of insights and ideas; rather, we must adhere to a conventional system of symbols. We are members of an inner circle, intellectually and socially; but like the residents of one of Dante's inner circles we For seven years between graduation from Washington and Jefferson College and the beginning of graduate work at Stanford University, ROBERT OLIPHANT was a professional musician. His present field of interest is English philology; he has published several articles on the subject in the professional journals and is now working on a book about the philologists of the last century. He teaches English at San Fernando Valley State College. 405</page><page sequence="2">406 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW are stuck in a common mud-our language. Most of us wallow cheerfully about in our linguistic mire. A few of us-our artists of language-play with the mud, molding it into new and fanciful shapes, making verbal mudpies for posterity to preserve and cherish. Others-our comparative anthropologists-study the mud in other sections of the human Inferno. They poinlt out that the aborigines in the next section are quite content with a different kind of mud. They suggest that these happy folk are not hampered, as are we, by a lineal, actor-action, Indo-European mud. Others-our philos- ophers of language, our "semudicists"-are quite disturbing. They point out that we can never move with grace and precision as long as we are stuck in an Aristotelian, intensionally-oriented mud. With some justification and considerable vehemence, they exhort us to move up to cleaner, firmer, more factual ground. "Speakers of the world," they say, "get washed. You have nothing to fear but a bath." Despite this salutary advice, we continue to wallow, amiable hippopotami that we are, splashing and spattering one another in a veritable orgy of communication. A few of us, however, are partic- ularly fascinated by the mud itself. We like to dabble in it; we like to examine its consistency, its color, its texture, even its molecular structure. We like to smear it on the wall and then analyse it care- fully. Sometimes we are pelted with mud; sometimes we pelt one another. We are the dedicated students of mud; we are the students of language. The student of language, be he traditional philologist or struc- tural linguist, deals primarily with the observable facts of verbal behavior; that is, he examines a number of utterances from a lan- guage, noting regularities and extracting patterns which lie behind those regularities. He then constructs a system, a "grammar," which defines the structure of all utterances in the language, actual and possible. A language is not the sum of what is and has been said. Rather, it encompasses what might have been said and what may be said. Given its structure, the possibilities of expression are limitless. From his analysis of the observable facts of verbal behavior, the stu- dent of language constructs a system which will encompass these possibilities, a system which will label them as "grammatical." While the utterances analyzed are generally drawn from speech, from casual, ordinary discourse, there is some reason to believe that this</page><page sequence="3">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 407 corpus might be expanded to include non-casual, extra-ordinary dis- course. Thus the student of language might with profit examine not only speech but also literature, for the latter forms a part-an essen- tial part-of the utterances in a language. To put it more technically, a language, according to the linguist Chomsky in Syntactic Structures, is an infinite set; that is, given a finite number of words and a finite system of rules for their com- bination, an infinite number of combinations are possible-com- binations which will be "grammatical." For example, the sentence, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously," is grammatically possible, although culturally improbable. The words themselves are familiar; the sentence itself conforms to the pattern of the sentence, "Lively young students study occasionally." f The latter sentence is a more prob- able one; that is, the listener could supply a context in which it would be appropriate, in which it might be uttered. Both sentences, however, are equally grammatical. The first sen- tence is an improbable one; but it is a possible one. It is nonsense, but it is grammatical nonsense. It fits the sys- tem constructed by the student of language. If we view our system as a machine with an input of sentence patterns, vocabulary items, and substitution procedures, it can be said to generate utterances. Many of these utterances will be non- sense, but they will be grammatical nonsense. An actual machine such as this would be a very complex one, much too complex for our present machine-building capabilities. But it is possible to construct a simpler yet analogous machine which will generate utterances. It will not, of course, faithfully mirror the incredibly complex work- ings of the human mind, nor will the utterances which it generates strike us as probable ones. But it will be an interesting machine, and the utterances which it generates may have some interesting im- plications for us as studen'ts of language, as students of literature, and as speakers and writers of English.</page><page sequence="4">408 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW One such machine has been constructed by Mr. Worthy of the Laboratory for Automata Research, Librascope Division, General Precision, Inc. Using an LGP-30 computer, an input was pro- grammed consisting of 32 grammatical patterns, a vocabulary of 850 common English words classified into 40 grammatical and syn- tactical groups, and a random selection procedure for selecting sequences of patterns and words to fit those patterns. The output of the machine was arbitrarily segmented into groups of six patterns, or "lines." Each group of six lines is called a "poem." The machine itself is called the "Auto-Beatnik." For example, given the pattern, determiner-plural noun-verb- adjective-conjunction-adjective (D I 2 3 C 3), random substitution from the similarly classified vocabulary generates among others the following combinations: i) "Few computers are cool but stupid." 2) "All planes are sexy but beat." 3) "All birds are starry and dead." Given a particular sequence of patterns drawn from the 32 possible patterns, random substitution within those patterns generates the following group of six lines, a "poem" generated by the Auto- Beatnik: Adieu, most moons are floating or neurotic. Act me, Or on the insect, she fell gayly, You tiptoe openly around an earth, And singing softly is like spinning drunkenly, That insect was very torrid. While the words within each pattern are familiar and the pat- terns themselves grammatical, the poem generated by the Auto- Beatnik is an improbable sequence of vocabulary combinations. Yet given our system, our "grammar," the sequence is a possible one. It is nonsense, but it is grammatical nonsense. To a reader, the sequence is possibly suggestive, but it is generated randomly, with- out intention, without reference to a context of human experience shared by the author-in this case, the Auto-Beatnik-and the reader. The reader, actually, is entitled to infer nothing regarding a pos- sible context or a possible significance, for neither context nor significance are part of the machine. It may be helpful here to apply Gardiner's distinction between speech and language. Speech, he suggests, is an event; language is</page><page sequence="5">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 409 a vehicle. Speech is a message; a language is a code. Speech-and we here include writing-occurs in a situation, a context, cultural and verbal. It involves a speaker or writer and a listener or reader, actual or assumed. A language is a set of symbols by which refer- ences are made to situations. Without reference to a situation or context, a statement has only grammatical and vocabulary mean- ings; it does not have the essential dimension of meaning-a "thing meant." For example, without a context, the phrase "honest Iago" has no significance, although the words themselves are familiar. Uttered by Othello, however, in the context of a scene in the play Othello, the phrase has considerable significance. Likewise, without a context the following statements, some from the Auto-Beatnik, others from contemporary poets, have no significance. Although the words themselves are familiar, the statements are only grammatical nonsense: My stomach is swollen and dumb. (Michael McClure) Mr. Mozart will be sore if his feet get cold. (Mitsuko Inouse) We glide softly on that blast. (Auto-Beatnik) While poets are kissing, that slow street floats slowly. (Auto-Beatnik) You are full of God's Saliva. (Murano Shiro) And all the slim, gracious, blind planes are coming. (Auto-Beatnik) In a context, hovwever, some of the lines have considerable signifi- cance. For example, one of the lines quoted occurs in a poem en- titled, "Physique :" Corpulent maidservant of the soul! You have a soft entry, You are a flower vase Incessantly leaking -You are full of God's Saliva. We may say, then, that the existence of an appropriate context assigns a significance previously lacking to a statement which with- out a context is only grammatical nonsense. Interestingly enough,</page><page sequence="6">410 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW Chomsky's example of grammatical nonsense, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously," was later incorporated into a poem by Dell H. Hymes, thus assigning it a significance which it previously lacked.' In the same way we can incorporate one of the lines quoted before from the Auto-Beatnik into a short poem; let us call it "A Prelim- inary Epitaph for Senator Goldwater:" Futility will make its stand on Right, And manufacture Must from Might. The men are silent, the mills are humming, And all slim, gracious, blind planes are coming. This process of supplying a context for a nonsense statement is an intellectually valid one. In The Philosophy of Literary Form, Kenneth Burke points out that the statement, "New York City is in Iowa" would have to be ruled out according to the criteria of seman- tic meaning, for it cannot be verified. It is, as it stands, nonsense. But he suggests that the statement can be poetically validated, and he goes on to frame a context which makes it a significant state- ment: Has one ever stood, for instance, in some little outlying town, on the edge of the wilderness, and watched a train go by? Has one perhaps suddenly felt that the train, and its tracks, were a kind of arm of the city, reaching out across the continent, quite as though it were simply Broadway itself extended? . . . "New York City is in Iowa" is "poetically" true. As a metaphor, it provides valid insight. To have ruled it out, by strict semantic authority, would have been vandalism. But the framing of a context for a nonsense statement is not limited to what Burke calls instances of "poetic" meaning. For example, the television program, "Keep Talking," provides its panelists, verbally agile comedians, with an isolated statement. The comedians then extemporize a narrative, liberally laced with jokes, into which the statement fits logically, naturally-even unobtrusively. Again, the comedy team of Nichols and May often ask the audience for an opening and closing line; they then proceed to improvise an amus- 'This line is discussed in C. F. Voegelin, "Casual and Non-Casual Utterances within Unified Structure," Style in Language, ed. Thomas A. Sebeok (New York, i60o), 59.</page><page sequence="7">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 41I ing dialogue, thus supplying a context for a previously isolated nonsense statement. Each of the contexts thus sup- plied is what Hans Reichenbach would call a "context of justifi- cation," rather than a "context of discovery." The actual proc- -_ ess of thinking, he points out, ,evades distinct analysis: it is in A part logically determined, in , part erratic, in part automatic. Hence the process of thinking, the "context of discovery," is left to psychological analysis. Logic, justification, is the touchstone, the validating process, of thinking, not its propelling force. As opposed to the context of discovery, the context of justification can be analyzed; it can be substantiated. It is "an ordered series of thought Qperations so constructed that they make the results of a thought justifiable." You will recall that contexts of justification were supplied for Chomsky's nonsense statement and for one of the nonsense state- ments generated by the Auto-Beatnik. Our machine, then, can be said to provide a context of discovery somewhat analogous to auto- matic verbal thinking. To go further, the context of discovery, in the area of social criticism, appears at times to be an automatic verbal process. Consider the following passage from C. Wright Mills' essay, "Intellectual Craftsmanship." Here Mills reproduces a portion of his notes taken while doing research during 1956-57: Mosca backs up his thesis with this assertion: It's power of organization that enables the minority always to rule. There are organized minorities and they run things and men. There are unorganized majorities and they are run. But why not also consider the apparent opposite? In fact, why not the full range of possibilities . . . ? On the basis of an automatic rearrangement of possibilities, Mills goes on to construct a hypothesis: From the nineteenth to the twentieth century, we have witnessed a shift from a society organized as i and 4 [organized minority and unorganized majority] to a society established more in terms of 3 and 2 [organized</page><page sequence="8">412 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW majority and unorganized minority]. We have moved from an elite state to an organization state, in which the elite is no longer so organized or so unilaterally powerful, and the mass is more organized and more powerful. You will note that Mills' hypothesis retains the adjectives in Mosca's original thesis and transposes the key nouns, "minority" and "majority." Later on Mills gives other examples of this kind of auto- matic verbal play, stating that "an attitude of playfulness toward the phrases and words with which various issues are defined often loosens the imagination." One can often achieve what Kenneth Burke calls "perspective through incongruity," and the imagination thus loosened can explore the possibilities suggested by the results of a playful manipulation of language. The context of justification is responsible, logical; the context of discovery, on the other hand, can be playful, almost automatic. The input of the Auto-Beatnik, you will recall, consisted of patterns, vocabulary, and substitution procedures. If we examine Mills' grammatical context of discovery, we find that in this case it consists of a quotation or "kernel sentence" and an operation, the rearrangement of the key nouns, "minority" and "majority," per- formed upon the kernel sentence. Putting aside the Auto-Beatnik, we can construct a simple machine analogous to Mills' grammatical context of discovery. From an input of kernel sentences and opera- tions, the machine will generate nonsense statements-statements lacking a context of justification. The machine, it should be noted, is not a genuine social critic. The statements it generates are non- sense, albeit grammatical nonsense, and any significance assigned these statements by reader or writer is purely arbitrary. The state- ments which it generates are called "opinions"; the machine itself is called the "Auto-Critic." For the Auto-Critic, the input consists of three kernel sentences drawn from a stock of non-casual utterances, i.e. utterances which are often reproduced or quoted by people who share the same lan- guage. The three kernal sentences are these: i) Poetry is emotion recollected in tranquillity. 2) Poetry is feigned history. 3) An honest man's the noblest work of God.</page><page sequence="9">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 413 The operation performed by the Auto-Critic is a rearrangement, a transposition, of first and last nouns. The nonsense statements thus generated are these: i) Tranquillity is emotion recollected in poetry. 2) History is feigned poetry. 3) An honest God's the noblest work of man. It should be pointed out that the kernel sentences and the nonsense statements are, as they stand, equally grammatical-and equally nonsensical. Contexts of justification exist, however, for the kernel sentences in the works from which they were quoted. Taken in isolation, a reader may, of course, discern significance in the kernel sentences, assigning a context of justification from his own experi- ence, recognizing in them a succinct statement of his own ideas. But this context of justification is, it should be stressed, an arbitrary one, varying with the reader's cultivation, his philosophical commit- ments, and the state of his digestion. In much the same way, an equally arbitrary context of justification could be assigned to non- sense statement 2), "History is feigned poetry," in the light of con- temporary attitudes toward the historian as an artist who creates the past. One could also be assigned to nonsense statement 3), "An honest God's the noblest work of man," in the light of current con- cepts regarding the whimsical anthropomorphic basis of religion. Indeed, in terms of their relationship to their kernel sentences, the nonsense statements bear comparison with Herbert J. Muller's ap- praisal of the lamentable social consequences of the industrial revolution: "Invention is the mother of necessity." Grammatically, the Auto-Critic can be made more sophisticated. To our input we can add a small vocabulary of grammatical forms, e.g. forms of the verb "to be." We then have two operations: i) a transposition of first and last nouns; 2) a substitution of grammatical forms required by the transposed nouns. A new input then consists of a grammatical vocabulary ("is," "are," "men") and two kernel sentences: i) Patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels. 2) Man is the measure of all things.</page><page sequence="10">414 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW The operations of transposition and grammatical substitution then generate the following nonsense statements: i) Scoundrels are the last refuge of patriotism. 2) Things are the measure of all men. Despite an apparent relevance of statement i) to the tactics of the House Committee on Un-American Activities and of statement 2) to our current emphasis in the suburbs upon the house as a status sym- bol, any significance, any context of justification, assigned these nonsense statements is purely arbitrary. The Auto-Critic itself pro- vides neither situation nor intention. It merely performs automatic operations upon an input of kernel sentences. In terms of vocabulary, the Auto-Critic can be made more sophisticated if we add a small group of noun-antonyms. A new input sequence then consists of the following: i) Punctualitv is the courtesy of kings. 2) Whosoever would be a man must be a nonconformist. We add to the input a small vocabulary: "woman," "tardiness," "queens." We then make the operation of noun transposition op- tional, omitting it in sentence one and retaining it in sentence two. With vocabulary substitution, the Auto-Critic then generates the following statements: i) Tardiness is the courtesy of queens. 2) Whosoever would be a nonconformist must be a woman. The operation of vocabulary substitution, or lexical substitution, can be further refined. In actual verbal behavior, the substitution of an antonym in word association tests is considered a common response. People with a high percentage of common responses. "high commonality" people, will associate "day" with "night" and "black" with "white." Low commonality people tend to associate more whimsically, e.g. "day" with "play" and "black" with "blind." In The Road to Xanadu, John Livingston Lowes cites an interesting example of Coleridge's substitution procedures. In Biographia Literaria Coleridge quotes a line from Otway's Venice Preserved. The original is "Lutes, laurels, seas of milk, and ships of amber." Coleridge, however, misquotes the line as "Lutes, lobsters, seas of</page><page sequence="11">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 415 milk, and ships of amber," substituting another plural noun which resembles the original in number of syllables and in initial sound, though not in lexical meaning. In terms of lexical substitution based upon sound similarity, one might also note John Kenneth Gal- braith's comment upon the past administration's never-flagging optimism in an atmosphere of national complacency: "The bland leading the bland." In a more refined lexical substitution procedure, nouns in a vocabulary can be classified and coded according to three criteria: i) broad semantic similarity, i.e. nouns can be classified as actors, actions, concrete, or abstract; 2) phonemic resemblance, i.e. nouns can be classified by their endings "ion," "ity," "er," or lack of end- ing; 3) syllabic isomorphism, i.e. nouns of four syllables can be classified together. In much the same way as the Auto-Beatnik substituted the appropriate part of speech, the Auto-Critic substitutes the appropriately coded noun. Since these three criteria can operate singly or together, there are six lexical substitution operations pos- sible. The following will serve as kernel sentences: i) Necessity is the mother of invention. 2) An institution is the lengthened shadow of a man. The coded vocabulary is composed of four words drawn from the AAUP Bulletin: "administration," "education," "committee," and "stupidity." The operation of noun transposition is retained, and the operations of lexical substitution use the criterion of phonemic re- semblance in sentence i) and that of broad semantic similarity in sentence 2). The Auto-Critic then generates the following state- ments: I) Education is the mother of stupidity. 2) A committee is the lengthened shadow of an administration. The coded vocabulary can be expanded, while still drawing from terms frequently used in the AAUP Bulletin. With an ex- panded vocabulary, the transposition and substitution procedures previously described, and the kernel sentences already used in this paper, the Auto-Critic generates among others the following statements:</page><page sequence="12">4I6 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW i) An examination is information recollected in hostility. 2) Linguistics is feigned science. 3) An honest bibliography is the noblest work of scholarship. 4) Criticism is the last refuge of incompetents. 5) Grades are the measure of all students. 6) Whosoever would be an educationist must be an illiterate. 7) Rationality is the luxury of philosophers. 8) Registration is the mother of confusion. 9) A professor is the lengthened shadow of a dissertation. It would be an interesting exercise to find contexts of justifica- tion for these nonsense statements, but our primary concern is with the Auto-Critic as a model of automatic verbal behavior. Broadl) speaking, the Auto-Critic is composed of a set of kernel sentences, a vocabulary, and a set of operations. The result is what we might call a set of transformations; that is, the output represents a trans- formation (nonsense statements) of the input (kernel sentences). In short, we give the Auto-Critic a set of cliches and a technique for manipulating those cliches. To put it another way, we give him a liberal education and a rather specious intellectual method. The resulting product might pass for original thinking, but it is not. The machine can only manipulate words; it can neither test nor justify the validity of its statements. The product is only an automatic transformation of a familiar cliche. It is what we might call a "trans- formational cliche." A similar pattern of transformational cliches characterizes a portion of the output of many educated speakers of English. Al- though the sentence and vocabulary input is more extensive, and the operations more refined, the result, I suggest, is different in degree rather than in kind. Many of the statements of Eric Bentley, G. K. Chesterton, Richard Blackmur, as well as President Ken- nedy's campaign speeches and Time magazine film reviews, can be analyzed in terms of the operations performed by the Auto-Critic. A liberal sprinkling of transformational cliches without a context of justification argues, I submit, a superficialty of content. It suggests wit without significance, form without content, high verbalism without high purpose. Such speakers are the prisoners of their education. They allude, they entertain, but they do not illuminate.</page><page sequence="13">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 417 They are, in large part, verbal automata, human counterparts of the Auto-Critic. And yet the transformational cliche, the automatic context of discovery discerned in C. Wright Mills, has its uses. Remember that his thoughtful book, The Power Elite, grew out of his efforts to find*,a context of justification for his automatic rearrangement of Mosca's kernel sentence. Responsibly used, the operations of the Auto-Critic can give us a powerful tool. While the statements thus generated are essentially analytic statements, tautologies, statements not subject to factual verification, they are often useful tautologies, expressing a concept concisely and compelling justification. The transformational cliche may serve not only as a context of discovery but as a concise method of presentation, operating as a mnemonic and persuasive device. In short, as long as the speaker realizes that he is automatically playing with words, he is entitled to play with them. It is only when speaker and listener begin to confuse trans- formational cliches with genuine insight that confusion looms on the horizon. Let me go further to point out that there is a kind of verbal behavior even more automatic, even more dangerous-and much less interesting. Erich Fromm has defined "pseudo-thinking" as the parroting of statements and ideas culled from an established body of opinion. Here the cliches are not even transformed; rather, they are reproduced in all their pristine dullness. The transformational cliche, at least, avoids the hazard of the culturally determined, com- pletely predictable opinion. As speakers and writers, our command of the transformational cliche, our mastery of the substitution and transposition possibilities wlthin our grammatical and lexical system, our I grasp, in short, of the structure of our I l language as an infinite set, may help us out of our linguistic and cultural mud. Like T. S. Eliot's hippopotamus, we may take wing, leaving our truly auto- matic verbals wrapped in the old mias- mal mist of facts and propositions. And in this connection, as students I of literature, we can use our knowledge</page><page sequence="14">418 THE ANTIOCH REVIEW of the possibilities of our language as a means of understanding and appreciating the mastery and boldness with which our artists of language generate statements. Witness the substitution procedures of E. E. Cummings' line, "She kept her sense of humor right up to the beginning." Note how Wallace Stevens substitutes verbs in noun positions in the lines, "Let Be be finale of Seem / The only emperor is the Emperor of Ice Cream." Indeed, the poetic conventions of rhyme and meter provide the poet with the substitution criteria of phonemic similarity and syllabic isomorphism. Sapir discusses Robert Frost's "Blueberries" in this way, and it might be further pointed out that the rhetorical techniques of our masters of English prose- Hooker, Browne, Gibbon, Macaulay-utilize similar criteria. Reality, we are fond of saying, is complex, infinite; but our possibilities for expression, given the structure of our language, are also infinite. The transformational cliche makes nonsense out of the conventional wisdom of the past, and then compels a justification of that nonsense. It makes chaos out of order, and then compels a reordering of experi- ence; but it does so within a coherent system. As students of litera- ture, our knowledge of this system gives us a grasp of the concrete facts of form, helping us toward an understanding of the order which the artist of language imposes upon experience. Finally, to the student of language, the transformational cliches of the Auto-Critic have some interesting implications. The Auto- Beatnik, you will recall, relied upon a linguistic analysis of English drawn from Fries and Roberts. It generated utterances from patterns and vocabulary groups, the stock-in-trade of the structural analysis of English. The results were, of course, grammatical and interesting. The Auto-Critic, on the other hand, dealt with our language as composed in part of a body of non-casual utterances, a body of quo- tations, a body of conventional wisdom. The system itself was ex- tended to include operations performed upon sentences; on the basis of these operations, statements were generated. The results were also grammatical and interesting. Further, they appear to mirror an area of contemporary verbal behavior. It may well be that a responsible analysis of English will have to consider the non-casual utterances extant in the language. After all, Webster's Unabridged Dictionary includes words used by Chaucer and Shakespeare. As T. S. Eliot put it, we dwell in the present moment of the past. The literary</page><page sequence="15">THE JUSTIFICATION OF NONSENSE 419 monuments of the past, remote and immediate, are part of the fur- niture of the present. Indeed, we use the present tense in discussing a work of art, and rightly so; for it is contemporary with us. It is part of the complex body of material which our linguistic system must encompass. It is, moreover,, an important part, providing the speaker with materials and patterns of expression. Ultimately, then, as the Auto-Critic might put it, the proper study of linguistics is literature.</page></plain_text>
