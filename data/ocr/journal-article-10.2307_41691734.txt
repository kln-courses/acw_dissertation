<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARYA SAMAJ SCHOOL OF VEDIC STUDIES By S. K. GUPTA Yãska in his Nirukta has referred to a number of schools of Vedic interpretation. As has been shown earlier,1 all these schools exhibit unity in approach in so far as all of them base their explanations on the etymology of Vedic words.2 Earlier, the Brãhmana and Äranyaka works also offer etymologies3 while explaining Vedic verses. Where it is not done, their explanation remains inexplicable unless a reference is made to the etymology of the word being explained or translated, whether taken as a single word or as a composite word of two or more monosyllabic units. The Vedic stanzas also in their turn have offered etymologies of several words.4 This ancient approach towards Vedic interpretation is rooted in the very nature of the Vedic language which has developed out of a monosyllabic pre-Vedic language and preserves traits of the monosyllabic stage.5 Yãska has, there- fore, presented several etymologies which presuppose formation of words by a combination of two or more syllables, each standing for a complete word.6 2. When Dayãnanda Saras va tï, in the 19 th century of the Christian era, began his religious, social and literary reformation, the ancient approach to Vedic studies had undergone a metamorphosis, with the result that etymology was either discarded and conventional meanings were attributed to Vedic words, or, where etymology was resorted to, it served as a means to support the conventional meanings.7 Dayãnanda once again 1.

The A. S. School holds that the Vedas are eternal and are a creation of the Supreme Soul Who revealed them to the four sages- Agni, Vãyu, Äditya, and Añgirasatthe commencement of human creation 1,96,08,53,078 years ago.9 This revelation was as natural, spontaneous and devoid of all efforts on the part of the four seers as the process of their breathing.10 The Mantras have no human origin. The names of seers associated with them denote the names of those persons who first realised the underlying meanings of the Mantras and propagated the same in the world. This view has presented some difficulties, since if it is accepted as such it would lead to the inevitable conclusion of the human origin of and association with the composition of the Vedic stanzas. Some scholars have, therefore, tried to reinterpret it. Pt. Udai Vir Shastri holds that the seers associated with the Vedic Mantras should be regarded as kavinibaddha pravaktã.12 S. K. Gupta has opined that the word mantradrastä means mantradarsaka, i.e., (a word) indicating the sense of the relevant Mantra.13 4. The language of the Mantras was never a spoken one.14 Its order is fixed and cannot be changed. But this does not mean that this language is artificial since artificiality is an attribute in relation to human works. This language is as eternal as the Supreme Soul Himself. It could not, therefore, be a spoken language. This view is partially tenable since, as stated above, the Vedic language has preserved monosyllabic features15 which do not allow the order in the Mantras to be changed, since any change will materially affect the sense/s intended by the composer/s of the hymns. If monosyllabic languages can be spoken today, there could not have been any difficulty in speaking the monosyllabic Vedic language in those ancient days of Vedic compositions. This school has not paid much attention to determine the exact nature of the Vedic language. It assumes it 8. It has been abbreviated as ť A. S. School ' in this paper. 9.

The four Veda-Samhitãs - the Rgveda of the Šakalya school, the Yajurveda of the Mãdhyandina Šukla school, the Sämaveda of the Rãnãyanlya school, and the Atharvaveda of the Šaunaka school are the original, basic and revealed Vedic texts, i. e., the Vedas proper. All the rest - the 1127 Sãkhã-Samhitãs are their explanations. They are not, thus, the original authoritative Veda Samhitãs.18* The Brãhmana works are not the Vedas proper. The aphorism mantra-brãhmanayor-vedanãmadheyam does not connote the correct view about the Vedas.19 It is a term coined for facility of treatment in a particular work.20 The Brãhmana works present an exposition of various Vedic subjects. All the Vedic and other literatures derive their authenticity or authority from the Vedas and are acceptable in so far as they are in consonance with the statements of the authoritative revealed Vedas. 6. The A. S. School differs widely from the medieval and the modern schools of Vedic studies in the field of the conception of Vedic deities, contents, and the method of interpretation of the Vedas. The word devatä (deity) isa synonym of the word deva (vide Panini's rule- devãt tal ) derived from the root div meaning 4 to play, to sell, to shine, to wish, to conquer, to trifle with, to rejoice, to be sleepy, etc.' ( kridã-vijigisã-vyavahãra - dyuti-stuti-moda-mada-svapna-kãnti-gati). The two words, therefore, stand for all the objects etc. suggesting one or more of the above ten senses. Since all objects in the universe are characterised by one or more of these senses, deva or devatã signifies everything in the universe and has been so identified in the Brãhmana works. This wide significance of these words has resulted in a confusion in the minds of those who are incapable of accepting or are 16. Pt.

It has, therefore, been a problem to all those whose concept of a deity, devatã , is limited to an anthropomorphic divine being and who understand the Vedic deities accordingly. Dayãnanda and his followers have discarded this limited, incorrect, and un-Vedic concept. Consequently, this school considers the subject-matter treated in a Vedic stanza as the devatã or deity of that Mantar as explained in details by Yãska in his Nirukta in chapter VII.21 Thus the terms devatã and ť subject-matter ' are synonymous with each other. This concept does not appear to be different from the views of the other schools of Vedic studies since they hold the deities like Agni, Indra, and Varuna as subjects treated, described, eulogized or prayed to in the Vedic stanzas, but it makes a world of difference in its explanation and application in lhe light of the meanings of the word devatã discussed above. The medieval and modern concepts of Vedic deities having been discarded as un- Vedic and incorrect, the words like Agni, Indra, Varuna, and others cease to be names of particular deities having divine existence or otherwise. Thus a Mantra with Agni as its devatã is interpreted to contain a description of all objects etc. which are characterised by the qualities of leadership, effulgence and the like signified by the derivative senses of the word Agni. The Vedic commentaries and translations of this school, therefore, contain a treatment of various worldly objects, situations and subjects, etc. relating to all the spheres of human life and knowledge including education, society, politics, admini- stration, and military science, etc. They try to indicate the presence of all true knowledge in the Vedas and describe even the most modern scientific theories and discoveries.22 Dr. M. L. Gupta has tried to interpret a descrip- tion of 13 moons and rings of planets like Mars.23 Dr. Mridula Gupta has traced the origin of the 12 original particles24 in the Vedic Mantras. Earlier, others have derived atomic, other physical scientific and mathematical formulae and logarithmic tables from Rgvedic verses. Dayãnanda Sarasvatî, in his introduction to the commentaries of the four Vedas, ' the Rg-Vedãdi- bhäsyabhümikä ', has referred to a treatment of aeroplanes, gravitation and movement of earth, telegraphy, electricity, etc. Several others like Bhagavad- datta and Hans Raj have also shown scientific facts in the Mantras.25 21.

Since the Vedas are divine in origin, there is no transitory ( anitya ) human history in the Mantras.26 The words which appear like proper names of persons, places, rivers, and such other objects, connote derivative meanings and should always be interpreted as common nouns or as epithets, as the case may be, with reference to their etymology.27 Thus Vasistha, Viávãmitra, Atri, Bharadvãja, and such other names cease to denote names of seers. All traces of the conflict of the Aryans with the aborigines or non-Aryans (däsas), the battle of ten kings, the legends woven around certain names and myths etc., have totally vanished from the commentaries and translations of this school. Pt. Hari Sharan Sharma has presented an etymological interpreta- tion of the seer-names of the Rgveda.28 Pt. Jai Dev29, Pt. Priya Ratna Arsh ( now Swami Brahma Muni )33 and others have reinterpreted historical references in the Rgvedic stanzas. Some work has been done in the field of Vedic legends and myths by Pt. Shiv Pujan Singh Kushvaha and others in the form of articles published in magazines and weeklies, etc. 8. This school holds that the Vedic sacrifices were free from all kinds of human or animal offerings. They were, therefore, called adhvara ( devoid of all injury and violence ). Animal offerings were introduced at a later stage by heretics ( vãmamãrgis ). The word yajña ( sacrifice ) is derived from the root yaj signifying devapüja, sañgatikarana , and dãna. All actions, works, objects and situations characterised by one or more of these senses are called yajña. The Brãhmana works have, therefore, identified yajña with various objects, situations and actions that are beneficial to human and animal beings in the universe.31 The Vedic commentaries and translations of this school led by Pandits Dayãnanda Sarasvatí, Ksemakarana, Jaidev, Dharmadev, Brahmamuni, Virendra and others fully reflect this observa* tion. Dayãnanda advocates the performance of all Šrauta sacrifices from the Agnihotra to the Ašvamedha.32 He accepts their treatment presented in the Brãhmana and Sütra works in so far as they do not go against the text of the basic Vedas.33 He has, however, interpreted the Mantras employed in the various sacrificial ceremonies according to his 26.

He has at the same time often referred to their explanation in the Šatapatha-Brahmana.34 In his commen- taries the Ašvamedha sacrifice ceases to be an offering of a horse to fire. It, here, advocates the protection, maintenance and prosperity of the nation and the country, progress in all spheres of human life, realisation of the Supreme Soul and attainment of salvation, etc.35 There is no trace of obscenity in his interpretation of the Ašvamedha verses as is found in the comments of Mahîdhara.36 The Agnicayana likewise deals with the uplift of a man who practises self-control, develops his various faculties, and ultimately attains emancipation.37 The Sautrãmani centres round making oneself and one's beings strong and healthy by using appropriate means like the drinking of juice of fruits and cereals and eating of invigorating food. The use of wine {sura) disappears totally.38 All other sacrificial verses and contexts have been interpreted similarly. Some schools have also observed that the Vedic sacrifices represent cosmic phenomena.39 Hence they should be interpreted accordingly. 9. Dayãnanda SarasvatI has given the names of metres as well as their musical tones ( like Gãndhãra, Dhaivata, etc. ). His computation of metres, however, is more minute than that of the Rgveda-Sarvãnukramanl in so far as the former enters into their minute classification. Sometimes he gives a different metre from the one indicated by Kãtyãyana. Pt. Yudhish- thira Mimansaka has noted Dayananda's computation of Vedic metres in his work ' Vedic Chando-Mlmãmsã ' S. K. Gupta has opined that, like the names of seers and deities, the names of metres and their musical tones also help in the interpretation of Vedic texts. He has also pointed out that ' metre names in the Rg-Veda signify something other than verses in parti- cular measures '40 Pt. Virasen Vedashrami also holds a similar view. He thinks that a knowledge of metres indicates the sphere to which a Mantra or its subject-matter relates. He also admits the existence of a relation between musical tones, Vedic accents, and the meanings of the Mantras.41 34. Vide TVB I. 1-31 and so on. 35.

The A. S. School has, thus, its own views on the method of interpretation and study of the Vedic texts of the Mantras. Like the modern school it is committed to its ideology. It holds that the method of interpre- tation followed by it is the most ancient one followed by the Vedic rsis and hence is the most scientific of all. It has also been followed by the later writers and interpreters of Vedic texts in the pre-Christian era, particularly in the pre-Päninian and Päninian periods.42 Since the Vedic words are yaugika ( derivative ) and yogarüdha 43 ( having both etymological or deriva- tive as well as special or conventional meanings )44 they should always be interpreted with reference to their etymology from one or more roots listed by Panini in his Dhãtupãtha according to the rules and practice of etymology incorporated in the Nirukta of Yäska, the Unãdikosa and the grammar of Panini as explained by Patafíjali, the Kãsikã Vrtti45, and Dayãnanda Saras- vatî. There is flexibility in the interpretation of words which is fairly well evidenced by such rules of Panini as bahulam chandasi and vyaiyayo bahulam 46 and several etymologies of the same word given by Yäska and others. Naturally the same word has different connotations at different places. Vedic words are, thus, regarded as homonyms. This school does not appear to pay much attention to the accents marked in the Vedic Mantras. Dayãnanda, however, has mostly followed the accents given in the printed texts, and has devoted a part in his Vedãnga-Prakãsa series, viz., 4 Sauvara to a treatment of Vedic accents.47 He and his followers are, however, not bound by the analysis of words given by Säkalya in his 42.

Dayänanda's analysis differs from Šakalya's at several places.48 There are certain places where Dayãnanda indicates a different reading in the text of the Mantras from the one found in the printed texts and gathered from oral tradition.49 This difference can be due either ( i ) to a different text- tradition now extinct or unknown to the Vedic world, or ( ii ) to misunder- standing; or ( iii ) it can even be intentional. Since Dayãnanda was not only an advocate of truthfulness but also practised it throughout his life in its letter and spirit, even at times at peril to his life and mission, the third possibility can be easily brushed aside and rejected without any further thought. There are several places in the works of Dayãnanda where his cita- tions differ from the printed text in the standard editions. This is because he had no access to all the original works when he cited them in his works. The different readings of the Veda-Mantras cannot, however, be placed on a par with other citations since the Vedic stanzas were regarded by him as an authority where no syllable could be changed. He, therefore, appears to have relied upon some other tradition which needs to be located. The criticisms of his commentary by R. T. H. Griffith and others50 are now not available. They might have offered some remarks on Dayänanda's readings. The A. S. School has, however, discarded the readings of Dayä- nanda's commentaries and has followed the standard printed texts of the Vedas. This school has not offered any remarks on this aspect of the problem. It is also silent on the problem of accents, which also differs from that of Sãkalya at some places, as e. g., in as against of ââkalya's reading.51 The difference of accent, however, does not make any difference in his interpretation leading to the inevitable conclusion that it may be due to scribal mistake. Pt. Yudhishthira Mimansaka has changed this accent in his edition of Dayänanda's Commentary of the Rgveda. Except for the notes given by Pt. Yudhishthira in his editions of Dayänanda's commentaries, the stray observations of S. K. Gupta, and modern editions of some Vedic works by Arya Samajist Vedic scholars, no attention has been paid to the text-criticism aspect of Vedic studies. 11. The A. S. School, however, does not undermine the importance of the Padapãtha of Sãkalya. For the major part it follows Sãkalya and departs from it in some cases only. Dayãnanda is particularly conspicuous 48.

In some places this analysis has found place in the printed editions of the commentaries. But in a large number of cases it has not been fully reconstructed and presented either by the Paropakãrini Sabhã or by Pt. Yudhishthira Mimansaka in their editions. It, therefore, needs re-editing with reference to the analysis given by Dayãnanda. Similar is the case with the Padapãtha of the Yajurveda. 12. The A. S. School lays great stress on Pãninian grammar and con- siders it to be a complete Vedic grammar unlike the modern view. It also tries to explain the formation of Vedic words derived by Yäska and others, accord- ing to the rules of Panini. Pt. Chandramani has done pioneer work in this field by so explaining the formation of words in his Nirukta-bhãsya. This school scrupulously follows the Nirukta of Yãska. Dayãnanda has changed the entire concept of the words collected in the Aikapadika of the Nighantu ( Chapters IV and V ). He holds that the words listed in this section are synonyms of the word pada and connote all the senses expressed by the word pada in addition to the senses expressed by the etymologies of these words.52 S. K. Gupta has examined this stand in detail and has defended that view.53 13. Where the words defy etymology, their interpretations given by the Brãhmanas and other earlier works have been relied upon. The Šata- patha Brãhmana is the main source for this purpose. The Upanisads, the basic sütra works of the six systems of orthodox Indian philosophy, the Manusmrti,54 the commentaries of Uvata and Sãyana have also been utilized. Dayãnanda has given a long list of authoritative and unauthoritative works in his 'Rg-Vedãdibhãsyabhúmikã.'55 No change - addition or subtra- ction-has so far been made in this list by the A. S. School. All the authoritative works can be utilized and quoted, if they do not go against the basic Vedic Mantras. The Šrautasutras have been used sparingly. No work on the ŠrautasOtras in any form appears to have been produced by this school. The Šatapatha Brãhmana has been translated into Hindi by Pt. Ganga Prasad. This does not exhibit any influence of the A. S. School. It was preceded by a Hindi translation and exposition of a part of this Brãh- mana by Pt. Buddhadeva and of the Gopatha Brãhmana by Pt. Ksemakarana Dãsa. The exposition of Pt. Buddhadeva deserves notice. Some studies of 52. Dayãnanda Sarasvatï, Introduction ( Bhümika ) to the Nighantu of Yãska, Ajmer, 1989 V. S., p. 3. 53. See S. K.

Most of them, or all of them, in fact, belong to the modern school rather than the A. S. School. Similar is the case with the basic Veda- Samhitãs and their Sãkhã-Samhitãs. Only the four basic Yeda-Samhitãs have been translated into Hindi or English. Except for the editions brought out by Dr. Raghubir and his son Dr. Lokesh Chandra and Pt. S. D. Satavalekar, the Šakha-Samhitas have not been touched. Some studies on the Šakha-Samhitas have been conducted under the supervision of S. K. Gupta who himself wrote a paper on the 6 Nature of Yedic Šakhas '55&lt;* However, it is very difficult to characterise such works as the product of this school. They fall more under the sphere of the modern school. 14. The A. S. School has not contributed much to the preserva- tion of the system of recitation of Vedic Mantras. Except a few scholars like Pt. Virsen Vedashrami and Pt. Jyoti Swarup, no Arya Samaj scholar is known to have paid much attention to this aspect. S. K. Gupta holds that recitation representing the printed accent-markings is nothing but one school of interpretation of Vedic Mantras. This interpretation, however, is not fully known now. All the extant writings have reinterpreted in their own way the Mantras given in the accent-marked text. The A. S. School has not expressed its considered stand on this point. 15. The conceptual studies of this school mainly centre round the social and philosophical aspects like the caste-system and the Traitavãda and its constituents which are essential for the propagation of the tenets of the Arya Samaj among the masses. This school believes in the organisation of castes on the basis of action and natural inclinations of persons and not on the basis of birth. Its concept of Šúdra is unrealistic. It holds that one who is not capable of performing any of the duties of the remaining three castes is a Südra.66 He, therefore, serves the other three castes. S. K. Gupta has presented a different theory. He has tried to show that the persons who were once regarded as the best among all the three castes and were known as rsis were later on reduced to the status of down-trodden südras.57 No other scholar of this school has paid attention to this theory about the origin and development of the südra caste which needs study from a practical and realistic point of view. 55a.

The traita-theory of philosophy advocating the eternal and independent existence of the Supreme Soul ( Tivara ), the individual soul ( J iva ), and matter ( Prakrti ) appears to have been borrowed from the southern Šaiva School of philosophy and reoriented in the light of Arya Samaj ideology. Several articles and the works like the Tina sanãtana sattãcm by Pt. Ram Chandra Dehlavi have been produced on this subject. This belief in trinity is fully reflected in the writings of this school. 17. Pt. Bhagavaddatta of Haridwar has presented some studies about the concept of Visnu, rsi, devátá, and Veda - all published by the Gurukul Kangri Vishvavidyalaya, Hardwar. Dr. Smt. Madhu Bala Sharma has presented a study of the concept of Vedic deities in Dayananda's Vedic Commentaries with reference to the First Mandala of the Rgveda. S. K. Gupta has published several studies on the etymologies and interpretations of Dayãnanda-bhãsya in the form of papers and articles which also contain study of some Vedic concepts. 18. The A. S. School is a great critic of the modern school of Vedic studies, particularly of its comparative philological approach. Criticisms of Swami Bhumananda58 and Pt. Bhagavaddatta59 and several others are many a time characterised more by emotional remarks than sound arguments and convincing evidences. Pt. Raghunandan Sharma in his ť Vedic Sampatti ' and S. K. Gupta in his papers and works have tried to present an objective and balanced approach.60 S. K. Gupta has also advocated a critical utilisa- tion of the material produced by the modern school. He does not agree with its committed loyalty to the medieval school represented by the works of Veñkata Mädhava and Sãyana, to the comparative study of mythologies which have originated from a misinterpretation due to incorrect and insufficient knowledge of Vedic teachings or original concepts, to the comparative study of religions without due attention to the history of their origin and development, and to comparative philological or linguistic evidences in flagrant disregard to the history of the origin and development 58.

This aspect has been ignored by the A. S. School which does not give much weight to archaeological discoveries and historical theories. It also ignores astronomical studies although it accepts astronomy as one of the Vedãngas. 19. Many writers of this school like Dr. Vasudeva Sharan Agrawal, Dr. Fatah Singh, S. K. Gupta, and others have extraneous influences also. Such writers have a modern critical and comparative approach which is generally lacking in the writings of the puritan or orthodox writers. 20. Many writers have chosen to present only the spiritual interpre- tation of the Vedic Mantras. The works of Dr. Munshi Ram Som, Dr. Fatah Singh, and Dr. Vasudev Sharan Agrawal are specially note- worthy in this field. Works of Shri Aurobindo Ghosh and his followers also fall under this category. Some are busy in interpreting the Mantras so as to bring out the most modern concepts in the fields of physical and other sciences.01 Not much attention is paid to subjects like education, adminis- tration, and politics. Dr. Saraswati Pandit has published a research thesis on the contribution of the Arya Samaj to Indian Education. Some papers have been published on various topics in the felicitation and commemoration volumes produced in the circles of the Arya Samaj. 21. This school, however, has influenced scholars widely. The trend in the papers submitted to the Vedic Section in particular at the All-India Oriental Conference Sessions by the younger scholars is a sufficient indication to this effect. This augurs a bright future for this school which is yet in the state of formulation. The Presidential addresses of S. K. Gupta and Pt. Virsen Vedashrami and others delivered at the annual Vedic conferences held by the Gurukul Kangri Vishvavidyalaya and the Sarvadeshika Arya Pratinidhi Sabha give a good resume of the tenets and trends of this school. Like the modern and medieval schools it has and will continue to have different currents of thought and ideologies centering round etymological explanations which will make it difficult to assign clearly some of the studies to this school or to the school of modern Vedic studies. 61.
