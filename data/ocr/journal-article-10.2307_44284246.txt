The critical attention paid to these lines is indeed well deserved, because they constitute a remarkably early case of the very self-reference which is one of the hallmarks of modern and post-modern texts. Dámaso Alonso, the renowned poet-critic associated with the modern revival of Góngora, and more recently, the semiotician Maurice Molho, have extensively studied these verses, revealing the salient features of Góngora' s use of the technique. A review of their work provides an essential foundation for more profound investigation into the use of self-reference in Góngora' s master work. In the Soledades, Góngora explores the very limits of language, violating the norms of syntax to the point of near incomprehensibility. For this reason, Alonso wrote a prose version of the work as a way of introducing the text to the uninitiated reader. In this prose version, Alonso reduces the opening verses to the following: Todos estos versos, dictados por una dulce musa, son pasos de un peregrino errante, pasos y versos, perdidos unos en confusa soledad, inspirados otros.2 Alonso thus establishes the fundamental identification between the metrical feet of the verses and the footsteps of the peregrino, together with the implicit equation of poet and pilgrim. 7</page><page sequence="2">8 HISPANIC JOURNAL Molho elaborates on Alonso' s reading, correcting, it would seem, an overly reductive approach by restoring the carefully constructed ambiguity of the original syntax. Molho points to the multiple meanings of soledad, which refers to the wilderness (selva) in which the peregrino wanders, to the labyrinthine genre of the poem, the extended silva, to the theme of solitude which is developed throughout the work, and finally to the title of the poem itself.3 This semantic polivalence is itself multiplied by the amphibology produced by the confused syntax; "inspirados," for example, may refer to the "pasos" as well as to the "versos."4 The total effect of this constant polivalence is striking: meaning seems to hover playfully above a network of symmetrical signs,5 none of which can be said to be purely denotative, caught as they are between exoteric and esoteric functions. This instance of self-reference, so closely studied in the opening verses of the poem, is no isolated case. Many related, if more subtle, examples have been overlooked, and while the phenomenon of self- reference is a generally recognized issue in Soledades scholarship, there have been lamentably few attempts made to understand the greater significance of the device in the context of the work as a whole.6 Eugenio Donato, adopting a deconstructionist approach, offers a useful point of departure for an analysis of self-reference as an essential component of gongorine poetics. His study of Tesauro's commentaries on the work of Marino, the Italian contemporary of Góngora, suggest a vital link between the phenomenon of self-reference and Baroque poetic practice. Donato focuses on what he calls the "compounding"7 of metaphor, the creation of a metaphor whose terms are, themselves, metaphorical statements. This trope is precisely the hallmark of gongorine style, a fact well-recognized by the poet's contemporary detractors as well as by more recent admirers of Góngora.8 Góngora renews and intensifies a tradition of metaphor which had lapsed into a sterile mannerism, in which metaphorical expressions gave way to commonplaces, codewords of an exhausted poetic language.9 Donato suggests that the result of this kind of innovation is to restore to metaphor its most unique powers. As he writes, Metaphorical language in a way destroys not only the reality of the object but also the function of the language which expresses it, since basically it operates independently of, if not against, the conceptual reality that makes language possible. At the most fundamental level, the metaphor, instead of being a</page><page sequence="3">SELF-REFERENCE IN SOLEDADES 9 restatement of essential relations contained within reality itself, seems rather to be an external epistemological tool to explore this same reality.10 The Soledades provides numerous cases of the use of the metaphor as just such an epistemological tool. I propose to focus on an example of one particular method employed by Góngora to intensify metaphor, the deceptively simple "interchange of attributes"11 identified by Alonso. The example occurs in the famous passage of the shipwrecked peregrino' s confused ascent of a seaside cliff at dusk: No bien pues de su luz los horizontes, que hacían desigual, confusamente, montes de agua y piélagos de montes, desdorados los siente, cuando entregado el mísero extranjero en lo que ya del mar redimió fiero, entre espinas crepúsculos pisando, riscos que aun igualara mal volando veloz, intrépida ala, menos cansado que confuso, escala. (I, 42-45) Here the phrase "montes de agua y piélagos de montes" represents the interweaving of two metaphors: "las aguas son montes" and "los montes son piélagos": the attributes of "montes," specifically the external shape of the mountains, and of "piélagos," the external form of the sea, are interchanged. The concrete identities of the mountains and the sea are obliterated; the terms are related metaphorically through the subjective vision of the poet. The words "montes" and "piélagos" are manipulated not to mean the entities they signify objectively, but to be perceived as pure form. Donato' s observations on the Baroque metaphor are validated in this example of Góngora' s poetic practice. In Donato' s words, The metaphor . . . empties the concrete of its essential qualities and creates a new reality which no longer depends upon the intellect. This mode of comprehension- in fact an apprehension- is most often expressed in terms of visual experience.12 Indeed, Góngora communicates the visual, almost phantasmagoric experience of the peregrino as he climbs a cliff, caught between a sea of mountains above and below, at a point where the horizons of land and sea merge (their differences obscured by the twilight and, presumably, by</page><page sequence="4">10 HISPANIC JOURNAL the exhaustion of the shipwrecked youth) into one confusing and new reality. The poet, rather than portraying a singular and objective reality, suggests instead the subjective dynamic of perception itself. This shift to the depiction of reality as subjective experience lies at the heart of the phenomenon of self-reference. Gongora' s poetics entails a constant recreation of the phenomenal world based upon a reality defined by the self.13 This recreation evokes both the essential and the non-essential, the thing-in-itself and the spectacle created by the poet. The language of the gongorine metaphor is both representational and non- representational; one cannot understand the metaphor "montes de agua y piélagos de montes" without appreciating the original, essential meanings of "montes" and "piélagos," even if the words are being used to communicate something else. Góngora' s metaphor simultaneously denotes and evades14 the objects of the phenomenal world, and the rift between these opposing uses of language lays bare the poetic process. To the reader who must continuously shift between these two types of language, it becomes apparent that, at the most fundamental level, the Soledades is a profoundly self-conscious text.15 If the compounded metaphor- what Severo Sarduy has called "metaphor squared"16- is the basic unit of self-reference in the Soledades, a further dimension to this reflexivity is gained when the poet elaborates a system of imagery of artistic creation. As Andrés Sanchez Robayna notes, the Soledades includes several images of writing: the flumen orationis of the first draft, the reference to the birds as "caracteres ... en el papel diáfano del cielo" (I, 609-10), the "anales diáfanos del viento" (II, 143), and the inscriptions of love on bark, stone, and sand, as well as imagery drawn from other types of representation: theatre, mapmaking, weaving, and embroidery.17 Sánchez relates the proliferation of such imagery to the topos of the Book of the World, the notion that the relationships and analogies within the natural world were part of a divine order imposed by God, who established these correspondences, as if part of one vast book, when he created the universe. Góngora' s response to this topos is not simply descriptive. As Sánchez suggests, Góngora uses the imagery of artistic process as part of an attempt to remake this Book of the World.18 Góngora aspires to impart to his subjective vision the status of the absolute; he seeks to take the place of God in his efforts to create a world through the act of writing. The imagery of writing, as Sánchez argues, bolsters this</page><page sequence="5">SELF-REFERENCE IN SOLEDADES 1 1 aspiration to create a new autonomous reality through art; in his words, "la realidad nueva, autónoma, de la obra, exige dotar al mundo de las características de una escritura para cerrar de este modo la concepción de la obra como mundo."19 This achievement, the creation of a reversible equation of book and world,20 calls into question the difference between "reality" and its representation, revealing once more the rift between opposing uses of language which is so central to the problem of self- reference. This rift is again exposed in a further category of self-reference. Esther Joiner Gates, in her catalog of the types of metaphors used by Góngora, has pointed out cases where the "literal and metaphorical acceptation[s] of a word" are juxtaposed.21 She cites the poet's call for the duke to rest his lance against an ash tree: "Arrima a un fresno el fresno" (Dedicatoria, 13). She also points to the description of the seal wounded by Filódoce's harpoon: "Las peñas embistió peña escamada" (II, 443). In each case, the juxtaposition of identical words, "fresno/fresno" and "peña/peña" has the effect of giving equal status to the plane of the "real" and the plane of "artifice." Art governed by mimesis (represented by the "literal," strictly denotative meaning of the word) is not held up as a norm; rather, it is used to highlight a new aesthetic goal of expressiveness (represented by the meaning of the word as determined by Góngora' s own poetic context). By equating the mimetic with the metaphorical, Góngora seems to be raising the plane of artifice to the level of reality. Yet the opposite is also true. Góngora lowers the plane of reality to the level of artifice. In cases such as those described above, Góngora implies that the "literal" use of a word may be as artificial as it metaphorical use. In a more general sense, Góngora seems to suggest the inherent artifice of all human thought. As Sánchez points out, in the Soledades reality is consistently apprehended through the mediation of culture. In the poem, he writes, "la realidad vista ... ya no es la realidad 'natural', que, a través de la visión de la cultura, la misma realidad natural es una imitación, un artificio, un libro."22 Góngora' s reinvention of the Book of the World suggests that the only reality apprehensible to man is artificial, constructed and configured by his own mind. The cultivated style of the Soledades levels all reality, the represented and its representation, into one common body of artifice. The Soledades thus portrays human thought, Man's capacity to perceive and to represent, as inherently solipsistic, revealing more about the nature of the self than</page><page sequence="6">12 HISPANIC JOURNAL about the reality it attempts to apprehend. This solipsism is the ultimate significance of the reflexivity of the Soledades. The reflexivity of the Soledades intensifies, reaching extremes as Góngora aspires to a godlike inclusivity. The paradox of Gongora' s efforts to create his own poetic vision is that the poem must deny the very subjectivity which engendered it. The drive to create a world of the self which is simultaneously beyond the self can be observed in one of Micón's speeches in the amoebean song of the Soledad segunda. Addressing the boat in which he is riding, he sings, el doliente, si blando, curso del llanto métrico te fío, nadante urna de canoro río. (II, 553-55) The "canoro río," as Alonso points out,23 is the river of his verses. The boat is said to contain the very verses Micón is singing; this is the essence of a modern Godelian paradox.24 Like the modern poet who seeks to watch himself write, Micón attempts to stand outside his own creative process. In his description of this fisherman poet, Góngora provides an early version of the radical attempt to break from the inherent anthropomorphism of human thought which characterizes much of modern art and science. It is significant that this last case of self-reference is associated with death. The death wish of the courtly lover is the frame in which Micón dramatizes his poetic predicament: trapped in a solipsistic construct, he is unable to transcend his own subjectivity except in the moment of self- destruction. Donato locates the basis of such a destructive tendency in the central dilemma faced by the Baroque poet: Inasmuch as he takes upon himself to found the rationality of the real upon himself, he does indeed assume the function of God, and yet inasmuch as he himself is part of the same world to which he has denies any rationality, his whole creation is bound to crumble in ashes and smoke.25 The demise of Micón's verses repeats in miniature this paradox of Baroque poetics, and reflects the greater drama of the Soledades as a whole. Góngora' s efforts to recreate reality in the image of his own subjectivity is a sterile, doomed aspiration which repeatedly exhausts itself in the imagery of annihilation. As I have shown elsewhere, the Soledades is fraught with destructive tendencies, culminating in an</page><page sequence="7">SELF-REFERENCE IN SOLEDADES 13 apocalyptic vision in the falconry scene.26 Gongora, like his replica, Micón, epitomizes the workings of the Baroque imagination; to use Warnke's terms, he is "incapable to imagining a world without imagining also its dissolution."27 The quest for an absolute poetic vision inevitably founders as it reveals the subjectivity which engendered it. This failure, perhaps a primitive version of the same defeat celebrated in Mallarmé' s Un coup de dés, is stunning to the modern reader, who is enthralled by what de Man has called "the enigma of language."28 This enigma, while present in poetry of all ages, has a cultural and historical basis in the Soledades, where it appears to reflect the special situation of Baroque man. José Antonio Maravall identifies egotism as the motive force in human relations in seventeenth century culture and associates this egotism with the acute isolation of the individual. As he states, Por el caracter clausurante del individuo sobre sí mismo que el egoísmo impone ... y por la reducción que ello implica de las relaciones entre los individuos, yuxtapuestos en meros contactos externos que no superan el aislamiento de cada uno, hemos sostenido que en el mundo barroco los individuos aparecen como mónadas en el plano moral.29 Baroque man is fundamentally solitary, left to devise his own, subjective orientation to reality in the void left by the demise of the platonie worldview. He is free to create his personal vision (and indeed, the Baroque abounds in creative energy), yet limited by his very subjectivity. The vision of the self is fragile and particular, never attaining the stature of the absolute vision it has replaced. The cases of self-reference is the Soledades which have been observed must, in the final analysis, be understood in this cultural framework. If in the Soledades there are constant reminders of the poetic process, constant references back to the self, and a constant frustration of aesthetic aspiration by the very limits of subjectivity, this is because the Soledades faithfully reflects the ontological isolation of its age. Self- reference in the Soledades is ultimately rooted in the very solitude named in the poem's title, a solitude which engenders a fundamentally solipsistic poetics, in which the only reality is the reality of the self.30 University of Missouri-Columbia Crystal Chemris</page><page sequence="8">14 HISPANIC JOURNAL NOTES 1 Luis de Gongora y Argote, Soledades , ed.
