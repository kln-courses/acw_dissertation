HARRY CAMPBELL, M.D.-The Factors which have determined Man's Evolution from the Ape.-Man's evolution from the ape has essentially been a mental evolution. Brain and mind have evolved parri passu by the continued selection of favourable hereditable variations. Mental, like morphological, evolution proceeds just so far as, but no further than, is needful for adaptive service. In order that an advance in intelligence may enhance the chance of survival, the individual manifesting the advance must be endowed with the means of turning it to practical account. Only a being possessed of prehensile hands, capable of giving effect to the. dictates of mind, could evolve into man. It was the abandonment of an arboreal for a terrestrial life, in the search after animal food, which determined man's evolution from the ape. Other contributory factors in furthering man's mental evolution were: (1) Poly- gamy; (2) Inter-tribal warfare; (3) Factors influencing the evolution of the feelings. PROFFESSOR CARVETH READ.-On the Differentiation of Man from the Anthro- poids. [To be published in MAN.] PROFFESSOR H. J. FLEURE and T. C. JAMES.-Ethnography of Wales and the Border.-About 2,300 individuals have been examined. Chief types :-- 1. An ancient type (pre-Mediterranean ?) with large, very long head, index 71, prognathous, strong eyebrows, receding forehead, dark colouring. 2 and 3. Mediterranean types with characters recalling Mongoloid and Negroid types respectively. 4. The average Mediterranean type--long head, index 72-79 (average 75), strong occipital protuberance, nose straight, slightly prognathous, slightly under average stature, dark colouring. 5. Smooth-contoured Mediterranean type. 6. Supposed diluted Mediterranean types-often have grey eyes, less occipital protuberance, no prognathism. 7. Tall, fair, light-eyed, long or medium-headed men, without prognathism, may be considered :Nordic. 8. Tall, fair, light-eyed, broad-headed, short-faced, and frequently aquiline-nosed types, may be considered Alpine-Nordic. 9. Dark, bullet-headed, short, thick-set men, usually considered Alpine. 10. Powerfully built, intensely dark, broad-headed, and broad-faced men. [ 175 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 101. ] M AN. [1913. 11.

In addition to the above types, there are distinctly red-haired inidividuals, Treg,aron, in Cardiganshire, being a mnarked centre for this clharacter. Women fall into approximately the same types, thouighi No. 8 is very rare among them; they are distinctlv darker than the men, and types 4-6 are specially predominarnt. PROFESSOR WV. M. FLINDERS PETRIE, LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S.-Ectrly Egyptian ASkeletons.-In. the First Dyniasty at Tarkhani the female htumerus, radius, and clavicle on-ly show the normal distribuitioni curve of a single variable. The similar male curves all show two suiperposed variables. The bigger onie is proportional to the female; the smaller type has no distinct female parallel. The female anid male curves superposed show the male minority clearly. Besides the clear nmale minority, there is a suggestion of a high and a low group of both male anid female of about six or seven per ceiit. of the whole people. That this is due to racial mixture is shown by thpe sudden appearanice of at much smaller type suiperposed oni the others in the First Dvnasty. This minority of invaders was about one-rintth of the males in the capital. In the first generation each had tlhree native females, anid in the next genieration two, in excess of the normal female numbers.

ROBINSON.- The Relations of the Lowver Jaw to Articulate Speech.-Tlie auithor said his object was to try to explain why man lhad a chin, and to show whether man's peculiar gift or articulate speech wouild not throw some light oni the extraordiniary differences between niaii and the anthropoids. The advantage of a clhin was not merely resthetic, it was niot outside but inlside. In the jaws of Europeans there were distinct tuibereles. First of all the whole jawbone had (Iropped downiwards and then on the inner side tubercles had developed. In almost every scun(l uttered by the tonigue, the genio-glossal muscle came into play. Among the lower races, and particularly those with imperfect speech, the tubercle was practically absent. In French and Italian jaws the tubercle was more symmetrical than in English jaws, and in Irish jaws it was very muceh more developed. The genio-glossal muscle was 110t necessary to speech, but in the higher races where speech meanit mui1Ch1 it was more highly developed. ETHNOGRAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY. PROFESSOR W. J. SOLLAS.-The Relative Age of the Tribes with Patrilineal and Matrilineal Descent inz the South-East of Australia.-If, as appeared probable, Tasmania was peopled by immigration from Australia, anid Australia by immigration from New Guiniea, traces of the more primitive people would be found in the soutlh rather thani in the nortlh of the continient. Observation showed that this was the case. I'he people of Victoria and South Australia were distinguishe(d by a greater simplicity in many directions, and some of them, such as the Kurnai, spoke a langmuage which fouind its closest ally in Tasmanian. Flat-headedness, a primitive character prevalent amonog the Tasmanians, was increasingly present from north to souith; in Quieensland, only 3 per cenit. were platycephalic ; in New South Wales, 33 per ceiit. ; in. Victoria, 46 per cenit.; and in the soutlh of Soutlh Australia, 76 per cent., or 1 per cent. more than in Tasmania, wlhere the proportion was 75 per cent. Possibly these southern people were no less primitive in other matters, as, for instance, in the ruile of patrilineal descent ; and it was difficult to resist the suggestion. that the evoluitional change had beeni from Kurnai through Kulin to [ 176</page><page sequence="3">1913.] MAN.

DIscUSSION.-The practical application of Anthropological Teaching in Uniliver- sities. [Published in MAN, 1913, 102.1 E. S. HARTLAND.- The Historical Value of the Traditions of the Baganda. ['ro be published in the Journ. R. Anthr. Inst.] REV. GEORGE HALL and W. H. R. RiVER.S, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.-A Gypsy Pedigree and its Lessons.-An analysis of the pedigree of a well-knowni family extending over six generationls shows a great increase in the proportion of marriages outside the gypsy commuinity in the later as compared with the earlier genieratiolns of the family, and a large proportion of marriages between relatives. In the earlier generations there is one case of inarriage with a half-sister, anid two between uncle and niece. Marriages between cousinis of various -kinds occur throuighout, buit less frequenitly in proportion to the total number in the later generationis. In the cases of the marriage of first cousins the children of two brothers have married more frequently than the children of brother anld sister or of two sisters. Several cases of polygamy are recorded, and an examiniationi of the marriages of widows anid widowers show no trace of the Levirate, and only onie case of marriage with the deceased wife's sister. T. W. THOMPSON, M.A.-Gypsy Taboos and Funeral Rites.-A womani's dress must niot touich any article of food, or any vessel in which food is prepared or from which it i s eaten. Tllere are many other similar prohibitions, multiplied anid intensified on the occasion of child-birth, based on the belief that the same contaminating inifluence emanates from ariything used in the washing of apparel or of the person, and anything connected with tile toilet or witlh the bed ; also from any sick person, together with spells and bad luck, whichl cling to and are coniveyed in clothing. This seems to throw some light on the custom of buirning, or otlherwise destroying, the effects of a dead person, which is the main feature of gypsy fuineral rites. Fear of the ghost doubtless underlies the prohibitioni on the uise of the name of the dead person, and on the indulgence in Ihis favourite food or drinik or form of amusement. It probably accounts for the now extiniet cuistoms of buirying the body in an isolated place or in a ditch, and of planiting thornis over the grave. Dread of contamination is perhaps responsible for the fact that offences against chastity used to be punished by death, or by branding and expulsioni from the band, and this same dread seems to underlie thebir one-time aversion from marriage in churches. The variety and instability of their marriage rites as contrasted witlh the uinity and persistence of their funieral rites suggest that they originally hiad none at all, but acquiired such as they have practised from time to time by borrowing from Europeani peoples. MRS. CHARLES TEMPLE.-Social Organisation amnongst thte Primitive Tribes of Northern Nigeria.-The basic principle of all the institutionis of these tribes was to place the interests of the comnmunity first and those of the individual second. Land teniure: They realised that it was essential that each inidividual slhould have the right to oeccupy sufficient land for his n-eeds and for that of hlis family, but that there should be no inidividuial moniopoly. Unoccupied lands are jealously claimed and protected. Lanid caiilot be lought, sold, or mortgaged, for the living inidividual lhas a right of ocelupanlev onlly. Every able-bodiedl male is expected to turn ouit for cotmmiiion defenice. A man with his wife anid children does not live to hiimself for hiis own aggranidiseinienit or tlieirs, but as a uniit of a larger famiily, owing allegiance to the senior, or- patriarch, [ 177</page><page sequence="4">No. 101.] MAN.

Besides blood relations the family conisists of depeDdants and slaves, who all owe allegiiniee to the Family Head. In many tribes these patriarchls formed a councieil of elders andt1 together directed the affairs of the community. under the clhairmanship of onie of tlheir numbl)er. Those tribes, however, who had united for purposes of (lefence and expanlsionl, recogniised one tribal clhief, anid he woould often appoint sub1-chiefs with jurisdiction over certain clearly defined areas. Sometimes the chiefs also performed the duities of high priest ; sometimes however, others were appointed to this office. Punishment for crimes inflicted by the coMmunal authority generally takes the formii of compelling the criminal to com- pensate thie injmire(d party, though anmongst certain communities habitual malefactors are sold ouit of, or banished from, their tribe. In doubtful cases ordeal is employed, whlen, e.g., the accuse(d is invited to establish his innocence by drinking water poisoned with salsswood, the e](lers having already decided the effect it is to produce. D)eath by ordeal is tlherefore a mode of execution like ainy other. MN AJoiR A. J. N. TIEMEARNE, M.A.-Some Notes on Hatusa Magic.-Love- ch,armis conlsist of (lecoctions which must be eaten by the personi desired, and there is usuially somie spittle of the amorous swain contained in them. Wives can deceive their husbands -with complacence by Iusing the earth from a grave, or the hand of a corpse, which prodluce a soporific effect. The most commnon aiimulet against thie evil eye or evil inouthl is the hland or "five" (fingers). A shred of time clothinig or some otlher article of the evil wisher neutralises the influence. If the Arab prayers fail to have any effect upon a drought, the Hlausas go in procession to a shrinie on a hill near the city, and there offer a sacrifice, summoim the boril, at(l ])perform the takai dance. Sacrifices are offered to Uwar-Gwona (Farm-Mother) when the corn begins to appear, and slie iniereases the crops of her worshippers. Hunters and warriors can make talismans wlhich eonfer ilnvisibility, and if a young gi'l with hler first teeth helps, the wearer will be protected against all buit boys witlh their first teeth can wound persons protected only by ordinary chliarms. W. FJ PFJntnY, B.A.- The Orientation of the Dead in Indonesia. [T-o be published in Journ?. Rt. Anthr. Inst.] W. TI. R. Rivris, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.-Sun-cult and Megatiths in Oceania.- It can lie establishedd eithier by direct evidenice or by inference that there was a, seasonal character attaclhed to the cult of the Areois in the Marquesas, andl the celebrations of Melainesian secret societies, such as time Dukduk of New Britain, the Matam)bal.a of the Solomnon Islanids, and the Tamati of Solutheirn Melanesia. The representation of the movements of the sun by such a simile as that of biirth and deiath suggests that these beliefs anid practises were brought by immigrants fr-om some nloirthern la tttitiude.

BU RNE. - Soulig, Cleamenting, and Catterning: 'Three November Customs of the Westernz Midlands. -Early 'calendar festivals were at once religious, social, and ecoi.omnic. The Celtic and, maybe, the Teutonic year also, began alnd eilded in November. It was a season of social enjoynient and also a Feast of the Dead. In Cheshire, North Sbropshire, and North Staffor(dsbire, on November Ist, children beg for clakes, ale, and apples. This they call " Souling." But in Souith Staffordsllire the dole of ale and apples is solicited on St. Clement's Day, November 23rd ; in North Worcestershire on St. Katharinie's, Novernber 25tli. The iiame varies accordingly. The observances as practised to-day sliow traces of early agri- cuLltural cutstom, of successive importations of foreign culture, anid of the growth and decay of early econiomic institutiotns.

POWELL. - Hook-swinging in India. - Hook-swvinginig is still practised in certain villages- of Cliota Nagpur. Two hooks with rope attachled to each are inserted in either side of the victim's back. He is then conduLcted to a raised platform bound to a loncg cross-pole pivoted on a tall upright post, elevated to the necessary height, aiid theni rotated. A careful examinationi of records goes to show that it is a Dravidian and nlot a Hindui rite. Hook-swinging 'is not synonymotus witli switiging oil liooks. Suspelnsion and rotation are the essential features of the ceremony. Lhere are grotunids for supposing hook-swinging to be a commuted form of human sacrifice. Further, if we examine the well-known Meriah sacrifice of the Khands, we finid that rotatioln of the victim was in certain places a very common feature of the ritual, anid it is probable that frorn such form of human sacrifi6e hook-swinginig has descended.

TREMEARNE, M.A.- The Bori Cult in Tunis and Tripoli. There are two principal classes of bori-those of the city anid those of thie forest- the former being mostly Arab jinns, anid regarded as disease spirits, the others pagan nature-gods. Generally speaking, the spirits have human forms with cloven hoofs, thouglh they can assume any form at will. All bori move like tlhef wiind. The bori live in Jain Gari, the Red City, which is alleged to be situiated b)etween Air and Aghat. Soothsaying is one of the fuLnctions of the mnasu-bori. Each lineniber of the sect specialises in certain spirits. The male performers are known as "horses," the female as " mares " of the bori. Each temple in Tunis and Tripoli is a lonlg, narrow room in an Arab house, in which are hlung the trappinigs of the daiicois anid offerings to the bori. Kuri's private apartment is screenied off, aiid muist not be enitered except by the Arifa, the clhief priestess, being a veritable lioly of holies. At the dances an altar is erected aiid a he-goat (after having been censed an(d specially fed) anid a cock are sacrificed in froint of it. Thein the bori ride tlle moulits, aiid the dances begin, each performer making some characteristic movemienits, and then sneezing and expelling the spirit. DR. G. LANDTMIAN.- The Ideas of the Kiwai Papuanis regarding the Soul.-The Kiwai Papuans use the same wordl for "soul," " shadow," " reflectioni in the water," [ 179 ]</page><page sequence="6">No. 1O1.] MAN. t1913. and " picture ; of these the shadow in particular is associated with the soul. Soul and body are to a considerable extent independent of each other. The soul wheln separated from the body appears, sometimes at any rate, as rather a corporeal beilng, wlicih can be seeni anid touched, and in the legends a ghost is often mistakenl for a livij)g person. Dreams are attributed to the soul wandering about and seeing variouis things. The souls of sick people in particular are in daniger of being removed by male- volent spirits or otherwise, for which reasoni the sick are watched over by their friends, and certain rules have to be observed for their protection. In a case of a very severe illniess the spirit of the sick person is thouight to wander about, anld sevelal means exist for bringin-g it back. In the excitement of a fight the soul of a man may jump out of his body, as slhown by the fury of those fightinig, and it has in certain cases to l)e brouight back. For the sanme reasoni the soul of a murderer comes out of his body anid is thought to follow the glhost of his victim at night. People who have been killed by a crocodile or snake, and also suicides, try to lutre their frienids into a death similar to their owln by first carrying away their souils. The appearance of the soul of a living man conistitutes an omeii, and therefore tthe old m-leni watch in the nlight before a fight. If they recognise some warrior's soul that mani must niot take part in the forthcominig fight or he will be killed. The soul of a ma n does niot niecessarily leave the body at the moment wheni he is beinig killed but some time previously, inl a sort of presenitimenit. A man may sometimes see his ownr soul, wlicih forebodes his death. Pigs and dogs have souls, and at all events in some cases when killed go to Adiri, the lanid of the dead. Miss M. A. CZAP"LICKA.-The Influence of Enavironment upon the Religiouts Ideas and Practices of the Aborigines of NVort-hern Asia.-In Northern Asia or Siberia there are two main types of geograplhical enivironimenit, with corresponding variations in the forms of shanmanism observed there. These types may be termed northern and southern. 1. Alolng the whole northern sectioni, a bounidless lowlaind zone, consisting of tundra, fishinig and hun-iting can be carried on in summer only, anid reindeer-breeding is scarcely possible, owing to the deficient vegetation. The people live for nline months of the year in unidergrounid or half-undergrounid houses. 2. Farther south the la,nd rises to the Siberian highlanids. Here the inhabitants of the steppes lead an open-air, nomadic, pastoral, or hunting life. The climate is " Continental." I. In the north we see the influenice of darkness, cold, and scarcity of food on the religious ideas of the people. There is a religious dualism, btut the worship of " black " spirits prevails. Family shaaniaiiism is more importanit than professional shamanism, since tlhe environmenit does not enlcourage social aggregation. The animals on which the people's livelihood depends are the objects of cult, inaniimate objects of worship beinig generally symrbols of tlhem. There is no clear idea of an anthropomorphic god; the distinetioii betweeni men andl animals disappears in myths anid in represenltations of superior beings. Ceremonials are almost exclusively seasonial, and are conniected with the food supply anid with the expulsion of the bad spirits. II. In the souith we find a religious dualism in which the "whwite" element prevails. Life amid open country anld mounitains has led to worship of the sky and heavenily bodies. Animals are respected, but not worshipped. In the mytlhology it is the manl that plays an heroic part. Comparative abunidance of food permits certain spontaneouis cerenmionial expressionis of religious feeling not necessarily connected with the food supply. The slhamliani is a professionial.

MARETT, M.A., D.Sc.-Recent Archceological Discoveries in the Channel Islands.-1. In colitiliuinig the excavation of the cave known as La Cotte de St. Brelade, anid the neighbouring area, the entrance of a seconid cave-or, possibly, of a cave running right roiund the back of the ravine continuotus with La Cotte-was discovered. Here a Mousterian floor with characteristic impleinents was reaclied at a depth of 27 feet. 2.

Discovery and examination of a cist or dolmeni of a type novel to tlle island, with surrounding stone circles and graves, at L'Islet, St. Sampsoii's, Guiernsey. 4. Other recent finds, ranging from alleged eoliths (Jersey) and palarolitlis (Guernsey) to a stone object resemblinig a mould, found in the Lower Peat-i.e., at the neolithic level-,but more probably belouging to a later periodl (Jersey). W. DALE, F.S.A.-Flint Instruments found in the County of Iatnpshire.-A series of " celts " from the coutnty of Hants, found in the surface soil, or never at a greater depth than two feet, was exhibited which might be classed as Neolithic. A study of the forms of the implements abroad belonging to tlhe later ages of the Palolithic period and a comparison with implements foulnd on well-klnowln British sites, such as Grimes's Graves anid Cissbury, have resulted in the opinion that manly of the chipped celts found at the places named and elsewhere should be considered late Paleolithie rather than Neolithic. J. P. BUSHE-Fox.-Excavations on the Site of the Roman Tovtt of Viroconium, at Wroxeter, Salop.-The area within the walls amoulited to about 170 acres-about one-third larger than Silchester. The site appears to have been inhabited from the earliest days of the Roman conquest. Tombstones of soldiers of the Fourteenth Legion have been found in the cemetery. The town, situated at the junction of two of the main Roman roads, appears to have grown into one of the largest Romano-British centres. Although all the buildings foilind differed considerably, yet tlleir general arrange- ment was similar. They appeared to have been large shops, with dwelling-roomis at the back and wooden or stone verandahs or porticoes in froiit, uiider whiclh ran a continuous pathway parallel to the street. One house showed as mnaiiy as five distinct constructions, which had been superimposed one oni the other. Among small objects found are engraved gems from rings, brooches of different metals-one set with stolnes and others eilanrelled-portions of two small statuettes of Venus and one of Juno Lucinia; also a small pewter statuette of Victory. One of the most interesting was a pewter circular bronze disc witlh a device, ill differeiit coloured enamels, of aii eagle holding a fish. Nothing similar to it of tlle Roman period in Britain appears to have been found before. Pottery of every descriptioni came to light, incluiding specimens from most of the principal Romaii potteries on the Continent. The coins ranged from Claudius to Gratian (A.D. 41 to A.D. 383). This year a temple has been uinicovered. It consisted of a podium measuring 25 feet by 31 feet, the walls of which were formed of large blocks of led sanidstone.

ASHBY, M.A., D.Litt.-The Via Appia.-The Via Appia played a very important part in the advaanee of the Romani power iilto South Italy. As far as Beneventum its course is certaini, and considerable remnainis of it exists ; but beyond this town there is considerable doubt about its course. In the neighbourhood of Bar, in the territory traversed by the Vtia Traialna, are the onlly dolmenis and menlhirs to be founid in Italy, except the group) in the Terra d'Otranto, and a somiewhat unexpected discoverv was that of a grouip of four hitherto unknown nlenhirs close to the road. T. ASHBY, M.A., D.Litt.-The Aqueducts of Ancient Rome.-The principal supplies of water were derived fronm the upper valley of the Aniio. The second of the aqueducts, colnstructed in 272-269 B.C., drew its water and its name from the river itself; while the third, the Aqua Marcia, built in 144-140 B.c., made use of some very considerable springs on the riglht banik of the river. During the following century use was miade of various sprilngs in the more immediate nieighbourhood of the city ; but Caligula's engiiieers returned to the Aniio Valley, and the Aqua Claudia anld Anio Novus, bothi completed in A.D. 52, drew their water respectively from the springs which the Marcia had already tapped anid from the river. The remains of these four aqueducts are very colnsiderable and comparatively little known, and by careful research oni the spot it has beeii possible to determine their course with fair accuracy from the springs to the city, eveln in the portioni where they rani underground through the lower slopes of the Alball Hills.

The drugs in use can be numbered by the score. Several have already long been satisfactorily identified. I believe that I have been able to idenitify two narcotics, one, the "' Heart-plalnt," as one .of the Hyoseyami, some years previously ; the other as the mandrake, to be used in allayinig headache by continiuous application)s to the head anid neck. In the tablets relating to eye diseases, the lish-a-bar is a drug of fairly common occulrrence, and from its conlniection with the mineral a-bar (probably antimlony) I see in it the well-kniown stibiuini used by Orientals. Aniotlher mineral in uise for eye troubles is copper dust, ill whichl we may see the forerunnier of the more modern suilphate of copper. PRoFEsSOR J. L.

The Philistiue conifederacy consisted of a grouip of allied tribes, the name of one of which (Cherethites) is translated in the LXX as Cretaus. The Caphtorim are translated as Cappadocians. Hence Caphtor is. probably Asia Minor, and in Rameses III.'s sculptures of the Pnilosatu or Pliilistines they are showvn with ani Asia Minor dress and equiipmenit. Therefore the identificatioll of both Keftiu and Caphtor witlh Crete has come about owing to the presenlce of Cretanis witlh each of them ; these beingc, the People of the Isles with the Keftiuans, an(d the Cheretthites witlh the Caphtorim or Philistinies proper. Keftili then appears to be Cilicia. For a view of her civilisalion it is necessary to isolate it. To do this a corpus of that of eaclh extreme-Syria and the Isles-is taken. Out of the eighty-seven Keftiuani objects available for stuidy sixty are founlid to be of Syrianiising types, whlile twenity-seveni are pecuiliar to Keftitu. PROFEssOR W. M. FLTNDE RS PETRIE, LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S.-Rccent Discoveries of the British School in Egypt.-A valley at Tarklhani was cleared and found to co.ntain some 800 more graves closely grouped on each side of an axial road. Thousands of well-to-do people were buiried here within two or tlhree genlerations, and we must regard this as the pre-Memphlite capital of Egypt, the critical meeting, point, of the earliest hiistorical race of Egypt witlh the prehistoric peoples. The earliest stage of the mnastaba and tomb clhapel can heCreB be seen in perfection. In the graves were large numbers of alabaster vases, slate palettes, anid pottery vases the types of these serve to (late the graves to the various reignis shortly before anid after Meina. Several blue glazed vases wvere found, slhowvingo, that such glazilg was commionly in use. Anotlher site, at Gerzel, at few m-tilcs further soitlh, has giveni goo(l results of the Twelftlh and Eighteenth Dynasties. Larre cemeteries were cleared anid soine immense -tone. tombs witlh chlambers as large as those of pyramids. The - finids incluided a gold pectoral inlaid with colouired stonies, like tlhe pectorals of the celebrated jewellery of Dalhslhuir in the Cairo Muiseulm. Witlh it wvas part of a similar jewel of Senuisert II. and a gold slhell of. Senusert III. At Mempihis nmore statuiary anid scullptuire of the Eighteenth and Ninieteenth Dynasties, hav'e beeni founiid.

CAPITAN.-Les derzieres Decouvertes d'cEuvres d'Art Paliolittiques dans les Cavernes de la Gaule.-Depuis quelques mois nos decouvertes en Dordogne avee Peyrony et Bonyssoniie ont montre qlu'il existait une autre variete d'ouvres d'art quaternaires. Ce sont des gravutres executees sur des dalles ou des blocs de pierre irr6guliers de 20 cm. a 70 cm. de largeur rencontres au milieu des foyers de l'epoque magdale6nieinne 'a La Ma(leleine et 'a Limeuil (Dordogne). Ces tres belles gravures non encore publiees sont d'un art tres remarquable. Elles representent surtout des rennes, tes chevaux, des bouquetins. Quelques tres belles sculptuires en ivoire de petite dimension accompagnaient ces pieces. T. C. CANTRILL, B.Sc., F.G.S.-Stone Boiling in the British lsles.-Throughout the British Isles few ancient sites have been explored that have not yielded occasioill burnt stones, which have no doubt rightly been regarded as pot boilers or as heaters employed in some form of oven. But large heaps of burnt, cracked, and broken stones, mingted with charcoal dust, although frequent near springs and streams in districts devoid of other evidences of ancient occupation, such as camps, villages, or hut circles, lhave seldom been recorded, and if noted have not always been understood. In Great Britain a growing volume of evidence supports the view that the practice of stone boiling onice ranged from the Shetlands to the English Channel. It is evident from previous records that in some cases heaps of pot boilers have been mistaken for burial mounds and for primitive smeltinig places. The boiling trouighs, where of wood, lhave been supposed to be canoes, anid where of stone, have been asstiined to be sepulchral cists. Sometimes tlle lhearth or floor of the cooking place was roughly paved with stone slabs anid fenced with a low stone wall, and these featuires lhave been mistaken for "stonie circles" or for the lower courses of beeliive huts. DR. T. J. JEHu and A. J. B. WACE, M.A.-Exeavations in the Kinhell Cave, St. Andrews.-A raised beach records an uplift of land after the appearance of neolitlic matn. The cave hlad been inihabited in Roman and early Christian times. The central date is given by a sherd of terra sigqillata (Samian ware), found half-way dtown the desposit. Quantities of slhells and aniimal bones were discovered, all the remains of fool. Oni the top of this stratuim a slab of red sandstone with inlcised crosses was discovered, which probably belongs to the early Christian period. PizOF ;ssoit G.

PE31AKE1..-The Early Bronze 4ge in the Louer Rhone Valley.-A survey of the implements found in the lower valley of the Rllone shows that the inhabitants of this part of France were only sliglhtly acquainited with the use of metal duiriiut, the earlier phases of' the Bronze Age. A nmap showing the distribution of flat celts thiroutgchouit this area seems to indicate that during the first Bronze Period the people were in a lneolithic state of culture, though a few bronze imple- nmenits lhadl reachled the edge of the area either from Switzerlanid or from the north- west.

The evidence for bronze axes rests nmainly upon the type, but this is very clearly marked. Since the publication of Ancient Bronze Implements in 1881 numerous additions have been made to the number of axes of French type found in Britain. [Published in L'Anthropologie.] REV. F. SMITH.- Pal kolithic "' Guillotine" 'rap-stones.-If prehistoric man were a strategic htinter, we may naturally assuime that very early in his career he learned to throw dowoL his " missile " lpoi a passinig quarry or enemy, and that it becamne in time a heavy pointecl stick, aind fiuially, with greatly enhanced effect, a pointecd stone. It is suggested that in the abnormally large palwolithic implements we have examples of trap-stones, too large for iise in the hand, uised in similar fashion to the suispended block of wood armed witlh a knife now in uise among many primitive races.
