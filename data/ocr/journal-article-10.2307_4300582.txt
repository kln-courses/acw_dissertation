<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KHAZINEH PAINTED STYLE OF WESTERN IRAN By Yosef Garfinkel Hebrew University, Jerusalem I. INTRODUCTION Dancing is an importance motif in the artistic tradi- tion of the Protohistoric Near East. In my systematic examination of this phenomenon I have located some 400 depictions of dance, which appear in many varia- tions from the seventh-fourth millennia B.C. over a vast geographical range: from Western Pakistan to Anatolia and Egypt, as well as Southeast Europe (Garfinkel 1998). In this work, however, I would like to focus on a specific geographical region (Western Iran), a specific time span (late sixth Millennium B.C.), and a specific decorated style (see below). In 1902-3 the French archaeologists J. E. Gautier and G. Lampre (1905) excavated Protohistoric lay- ers at Tepe Musiyan (Moussian) and Khazineh in the Deh Luran Plain, Khuzistan, Western Iran (Fig. 1; for an enlarged map of the Deh Luran Plain, see Hole et al. 1969:14). Their publication presented the first examples of a distinct type of decoration painted on pottery vessels (Fig. 2). In the later work of Hole, Flannery and Neely this decoration is described as: "a motif which shows stylized human dancers standing on each others' shoulders. This design often occurs in conjunction with panels of white and black scalene triangles. Usually the 'danc- ing men' are arranged as an almost geometric design" (Hole et al. 1969:157). The term "Khazineh Painted Style" will be used in this paper for this deco- ration, in honour of Gautier and Lampre's pioneer work, undertaken some hundred years ago. Similar items have been reported over the years from Western Iran, either unearthed during excava- tions or collected on the surface during site surveys. In the autumn of 1995, when I was a research affili- ate at the Department of Anthropology of Yale University, I had the opportunity to study and analyse some seventy items decorated in this style, which were discovered by Prof. F. Hole at seven dif- ferent sites in the Deh Luran Plain. The purpose of this article is to present the Khazineh Painted Style and to analyse various aspects of this artistic tradi- tion. It is adding another dimension to the subject of painted prehistoric pottery of Western Iran, which was dealt by other scholars as well (see, for example, Hole 1983, Pollock 1983).

Geographical Distribution Items decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style, as defined in the next section, have been discovered at various sites in Western Iran. They are presented here according to the order in which they were published: 57</page><page sequence="2">58 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES 1. Khazineh: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. As mentioned above, it was excavated by Gautier and Lampre in 1902-1903, and was the first site to produce pottery decorated in this style (Fig. 2:1, 3-4, 6). Another item bears a more realistic depiction of dance (Fig. 2:5). 2. Tepe Musiyan: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. It was excavated together with the previ- ous site by Gautier and Lampre in 1902-1903. They published one item which may be relevant to the Khazineh Painted Style (Fig. 2:2). In 1963 Hole, Flannery and Neely (1969:65-72) excavated a small test pit (Area E) at the site. Black-on-buff pottery decorated with the motif of "dancing men" is reported in the text (Hole et al. 1969:68-69). No drawings have been published. Examination of the Fig. 2.

The small collection of sherds from the site includes one item decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style (Fig. 7:9). 5. Kozagaran: This site is located in Luristan. As with the previous site, a small assemblage of sherds was collected here by Stein (1940:198-205, pl. VIII). A few examples of the Khazineh Painted Style have been published (Figs. 4:8; 9:3-4). 6. Tepe Sabz: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. Hole, Flannery and Neely excavated it in the early 1960s. Here items decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style were discovered for the first time in large quantities and in a clear stratigraphic context. They have been dated to the Mehmeh phase (Hole et al. 1969:157). The Khazineh Painted Style appears on bell- shaped (Type 11) bowls and it belongs to the "Susiana Black-on-Buff' pottery ware. The report presents a few items (the best-preserved ones) deco- rated in the Khazineh Painted Style (Hole et al. 1969, pls. 25:a-b, 27:b,j, 28.j-k), with a short commentary (Hole et al. 1969:157).

Large decorated bell-shaped bowls from Tepe Sabz (scale 1:2). material at Yale University revealed fifty-two such decorated sherds (see, for example, Figs. 3:2-4; 4:1-3, 5-6; 5; 6:3-4; 7:1-3, 6, 8; 9:5-7; 11:3-5; 12). This is the largest assemblage from a single site known to date. 7. Chogha Mish: This site is located in the Susiana Plain, Khuzistan. Delougaz and Kantor have con- ducted large-scale excavations here during the 1970s. On one bowl, published only in a photo- graph, two vertical rows of schematic figures are visible (Fig. 8:1). This item has been described as a "Middle Susiana 2 fine-ware bowl with abstract tiered designs" (Kantor 1976:189, fig. 7). A similar pattern appears on another bowl, also dated to the Middle Susiana phase (Fig. 8:4). This decoration has been described in the final publication report as "the ele- ments here seems to be superimposed human torsos (Delougaz and Kantor 1996:186, pl. 171:d) 8. Chagha Sefid: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. It was excavated by Hole in the early 1970s (1977). Examination of the original material at Yale University revealed two sherds decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style (Figs. 6:5; 11:2). 9. Farukhabad: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. The excavations here concentrated on the fourth-third millennia B.C., but a few earlier sherds were also published (Wright 1981). One of them bears a net-covered area, typical of the Khazineh Painted Style (Fig. 11:1). 10. Do Tulune: This site is located near Behbehan in Western Iran (Dittmann 1984). A survey collec- tion included one painted sherd decorated with a vertical row of schematic human figures typical of the Khazineh Painted Style (Fig. 8:3). 11. DK-14: This site is located outside the Deh Luran Plain, in the direction of Luristan. It was discov- ered during a survey conducted in the region by F. Hole (pers. comm.). One sherd decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style was collected from the site sur- face, and is now in store at Yale University (Fig. 8:2).</page><page sequence="6">62 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Fig. 6. Large decorated bell-shaped bowls (scale 1:2): 1-2. Musiyan; 3-4. Tepe Sabz; 5. Chagha Sefid. 12. DL-22: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. It was discovered during a survey conducted in the region by F. Hole (pers. comm.). Two sherds decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style were col- lected from the site surface, and are now in store at Yale University (Figs. 4:7; 7:4). 13. DL-28: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. It was discovered during a survey conducted in the region by F. Hole (pers. comm.). Two sherds decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style were col- lected from the site surface, and are now in store at Yale University (Figs. 4:9, 9:8). 14. DL-13: This site is located in the Deh Luran Plain. It was discovered during a survey conducted in the region by F. Hole (pers. comm.). One sherd dec- orated in the Khazineh Painted Style was collected from the site surface, and is now in store at Yale University (Fig. 4:10). A total of fourteen sites have been listed here, at which about ninety items relevant to the Khazineh Painted Style were unearthed. As regards the geo- graphical distribution, most of the sites are located in the Deh Luran Plain (eight sites, 57%). Most of the other sites are located nearby in other parts of Khuzistan or in Luristan; only the site of Do Tulune is located further to the south-east. When the distrib- ution of the items is examined, 74 (c. 80 %) of them turn out to have been discovered in the Deh Luran plain. It is thus quite clear that the Deh Luran Plain was the core area for the production and use of the Khazineh Painted Style. 2. Chronology The best stratigraphic evidence for the Khazineh Painted Style comes from the Tepe Sabz excavations. Here pottery items decorated in this style are "particu- larly characteristic of the Mehmeh phase" (Hole et al. 1969:157). Hole, Flannery and Neely note that "ties with the Mehmeh phase are widespread, including Susiana c, Ras al 'Amiya, and Eridu XII" (1969:61). This phase is thus dated to the first half of the 5th mil- lennium B.C. (uncalibrated). With calibration it is dated to the late 6th millennium B.C. (Hole 1987:57, Table 2; Voigt and Dyson 1992, fig. 2). III. THE KHAZINEH PAINTED STYLE The Khazineh Painted style appears on the "Susiana Black-on Buff' ware, together with other motifs, like the "rows of goats". This ware has already been described in detail by Hole et al. (1969: 124-26,</page><page sequence="7">THE KHAZINEH PAINTED STYLE OF WESTERN IRAN 63 Fig. 7. Figures with "wing-like" hands or figures holding branches: 1-3, 6, 8. Tepe Sabz (scale 1:2); 4. DL-22 (scale 1:2); 5,7, 10. Tepe Giyan (Contenau and Ghirshman 1935, pls. 41, 43, 42); 9. Tul-i Bawa Muhammad (Stein 1940, pl. VIII:20). 132-35). It is a hard, well-fired and sand tempered pottery with a buff to greenish-buff colour. The sur- face is well smoothed, but not burnished. In some cases a wash or slip of the same clay as the paste pro- vides a suitable background for the paint (self slip). On this surface the design was painted in one colour (monochrome). The painting was done on the exte- rior face of the bowl. The paint was based on iron compounds and is usually black but occasionally red. The painting was done with a very delicate brush, as the pattern includes very thin lines. The Khazineh Painted Style usually appears on bell-shaped bowls. In the assemblage from Tepe Sabz, thirty-eight of the fifty-two sherds, are frag- ments of medium-sized bell-shaped bowls (Figs. 3:3-4; 4:1-3, 5-6). Five items are fragments of similar small bowls (Fig. 3:2) and nine are fragments of sim- ilar large bowls (Figs. 5:1-2, 6:3-4). One of these items is somewhat bigger, and may be a fragment of a large crater (Fig. 6:4). Only in one clear case, on an item from Tepe Musiyan, does the Khazineh Painted Style appear on a closed vessel (Fig. 9:1). The best-preserved items, which should be used as the basis for analysing the Khazineh Painted Style, are one complete bell shaped bowl from Khazineh (Fig. 2:1) and two large fragments of similar bowls from Tepe Sabz (Fig. 3:3-4). These three items are almost identical, and seem to represent the "classic" style. Most of the other items bear the same composi- tion, but some sherds testify that slightly different versions co-exist side by side with the "classic" one. The decoration is composed of a central register, which occupies most of the vessel surface. This regis- ter is framed by horizontal lines above and below. Above, there is a thick line at the rim and a thin line immediately below it. Below, there is a thin line first and than, immediately below it, a thick line closer to the base of the vessel. In one example the frame's pattern is more elaborate, including black and white triangles (Fig. 5:1).</page><page sequence="8">64 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Fig. 8. Items with a vertical row of single figures: 1. Chogha Mish (Kantor 1976, fig. 7); 2. DK-41 (scale 1:2); 3. Do Tulune (Dittmann 1984, fig. 10:1); 4. Chogha Mish (Delougaz and Kantor 1996, pl. 1 71:d). In the main register the composition includes two components: schematic human figures and geomet- ric panels. Since the decorative pattern on the pot- tery vessels is usually symmetrical, it seems that the human figures and the geometric elements would have appeared twice on the vessel's periphery. 1. The Human Figures A head, a triangular torso, arms and the hand's fingers represent the human figure. This unit can be multiplied in two different directions: a. Horizontally: One (Fig. 8), two (Fig. 2:6), three (Figs. 2:1, 4; 3:3-4, 5:1-2), four (Fig. 6:4) or six (Fig. 9:1) such units can be placed together horizontally. When more than one figure appears, only the arms and fingers of the outer figures are portrayed. This gives the impression that the figures are standing shoulder to shoulder. Naturalistic representations of this grouping have been reported from Protohistoric sites in the region: Choga Mami (Fig. 14:1) and Tepe Sialk (Fig. 14:2). b. Vertically: Any of the above-mentioned hori- zontal compositions may be multiplied vertically, one on top of the other. There are clear examples of one (Fig. 5:1), two (Figs. 2:1, 4; 3:2-4), three (Fig. 8:4), four (Fig. 8:1) and five (Fig. 2:6) such combina- tions. In Figure 10 the different combinations are pre- sented in a chart that juxtaposes the horizontal and the vertical possibilities, as well as the specific combi- nations that have been used. The most common combination is a horizontal row of three figures, multiplied by two. Close examination of the various parts of the human figures reveals the following details: Heads: What may be interpreted as heads or necks is a group of short, parallel, vertical lines</page><page sequence="9">THE KHAZINEH PAINTED STYLE OF WESTERN IRAN 65 Fig. 9. Additional examples of the Khazineh Painted Style (scale 1:2): 1-2. Musiyan; 3-4. Kozagaran (Stein 1940, pl. VIII:3-4); 5-7. Tepe Sabz; 8. DL-28. which appear between the topmost triangles and the upper frame (Figs. 2:1, 4, 6; 3:3-4; 4:1-3; 5:1-2). In cases where the vertical row is composed of sin- gle triangles, there is one head. In one such item there is an elongated narrow neck and a small round head (Fig. 8:2). In another item there is just one schematic line (Fig. 8:1). In cases where the vertical row is composed of double triangles three (not two) short lines represent the heads (Fig. 2:6). In cases where the vertical row is composed of three triangles the heads are represented by four (Fig. 2:1), five (Figs. 2:4; 3:3-4), six (Figs. 4:1-2; 5:1) and seven (Fig. 5:2) lines. There is clearly no correlation between the number of "heads" and the number of triangles below them. Torso: The torso is usually triangular. In some cases the triangle is wider in proportion (Figs. 2:4; 5:1), while in others it is narrower (Figs. 2:1; 6:1). Human figures with triangular torsos appear in natu- ralistic representations from the same period (Figs. 2:5; 14:1-4). At the site of Kozagaran the human body is some- times represented as rhomboid (Fig. 9:4). Only one such example is presented here, but a few more have been collected from the same site (Stein 1940, pl. VIII). Arms and Hands: There are a few possible combi- nations for the arms and fingers: a. The arms are bent, first downwards and then upwards away from the body. Similar bent arms are shown in some naturalistic items dated to the late 6th-early 5th millennia B.C. (Figs. 2:5; 14:1-2, 4). In some of these examples the human figures are depicted shoulder to shoulder, with a triangular torso (Fig. 14:1-2). The arms end with three fingers. The fingers can be shown either as thin straight short lines (Fig. 2:1, 4, 6) or in more rounded shapes (Figs. 4:3; 9:1). The fingertips are at the same height as the top of the torso (Figs. 2:1, 4; 3:2), or slightly higher (Figs. 2:6; 4:3, 8; 9:1). b. As in the previous category the arms seem to be bent upwards but do not end with fingers at the top. Instead, the parts of the arms that bend upwards are covered with a series of short straight parallel lines, projecting away from the body. The number of these</page><page sequence="10">66 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES short straight lines varies: five (Fig. 7:8, 10), six (Fig. 7:4, 6), seven (Fig. 7:2) and nine (Fig. 7:3). It thus seems that these short lines do not represent fingers and another interpretation is required. Some items from Layer X at Tepe Gawra (Fig. 14:4) and from Tall-i Bakun A in the Fars (Fig. 14:3) may supply a solution to this: in these examples one can see human figures holding branches in their hands. In analogy to this it may be suggested that some of the figures in the Khazineh Painted Style are shown not with bent arms but with the arms extending diago- nally downward, holding branches. Of the ten examples shown in Figure 7, five are vertical rows of single triangles. Most of these items have been reported from Luristan: Tepe Giyan (Fig. 7:5, 7, 10) and Tul-i Bawa Muhammad (Fig. 7:9). There is only one example of this type from Tepe Sabz (Fig. 7:8). Since no complete vessel with this specific composition has been reported, their classi- fication as Khazineh Painted Style is not conclusive. They certainly resemble rows of flying birds, a motif which has occasionally been reported from southern Mesopotamia and Iran (Stucki 1984, pl. XXVIII). 2. The Geometric Panels In all the cases where the preserved sherds were large enough, the human figures were found near another, geometric, element. Sometimes this ele- ment is to the left of the figures (Figs. 2:1; 3:4; 4:4-5; 5:1) and sometimes to the right (Figs. 3:3; 4:6-8, 10; 5:2). The figures can be located very close to the geo- metric element (Fig. 4:7-8, 10), or at some distance from it (Figs. 3:3-4; 4:4; 5:2). The following different versions of the geometric element have been noted: a. A rectangle or square area divided into three parts. It is framed by four vertical lines on both sides (Figs. 2:1; 3:3-4). The centre is decorated with a checkerboard pattern. Additional divisions halve each chequer into two triangles. Alternate triangles 6 5 4 3 2 1 3 5 Fig. 10. The different combinations of the anthropomorphic figures in the Khazineh Painted Style.</page><page sequence="11">THE KHAZINEH PAINTED STYLE OF WESTERN IRAN 67 were painted black. Not all the rows of triangles were painted in the same order: in some rows the upper triangles were painted black and in other rows the lower ones. This is the most common type of geo- metric panel. On one exceptional item, the central checker- board pattern is framed by a single vertical line (Fig. 4:8), and not by four, as with all the other examples. b. In a few cases, instead of triangles the chequers squares were alternately painted black, creating a chessboard pattern (Figs. 5:1; 11:3). c. On a sherd from Tepe Sabz there is a rectangu- lar area covered by a net pattern adjacent to the area covered by the triangles (Fig. 11:4). d. One fragmentary item from Tepe Sabz bears an unusual composition (Fig. 11:5). A bent hand is shown in front of a net covered area, with a vertical line with five perpendicular short lines extending from it. A somewhat different pattern appears on an item from Tepe Giyan (Fig. 7:5). e. It seems to me that there is another pattern that can be reconstructed from two fragmentary items, each of which preserves only part of it. Further exca- vations may clarify more details of this pattern. On one item there is a bent arm ending with three fin- gers, with three fingers from another figure below. At the other side of the sherd, instead of the vertical lines and checkerboard composition, there are traces of a zigzag pattern (Fig. 12:2). Another item, in a better state of preservation, bears the classical triangle checkerboard composi- tion; in front of this is a complete zigzag pattern, composed of three vertical parallel lines (Fig. 12:1). This is the only example I have seen from Tepe Sabz in which motifs other than human figures appear near the geometric panel. If we combine the evidence from these two sherds, it is possible that in some cases three ele- ments were portrayed together in the Khazineh Painted Style: the human figures, the zigzag lines and the geometric panel (Fig. 13). The meaning of the zigzag pattern is not clear, though Ms. Diana Mickle of Yale University has suggested that it may represent a river (pers. comm.). f. One item from Khazineh presents a vertical row of schematic human figures next to a vertical row of three round elements (Fig. 2:6). Another item from the site, painted in a naturalistic style, depicts a hori- zontal row of human figures and a horizontal row of three round elements (Fig. 2:5). The round ele- ments in both examples are similar. The function of these circles is not clear, though it has been sug- gested that they represent the moon (Ackerman 1967). g. One item from Chogha Mish bears a pattern composed of thin parallel vertical lines, with no checkerboard pattern and no alternately painted tri- angles (Fig. 8:1). Since the human figures on this Fig. 11. Various examples of the net-covered area (scale 1:2): 1. Tepe Farukhabad (Wright 1981, fig. 11:c); 2. Chagha Sefid; 3-5.

Items decorated in the Khazineh Painted Style with zigzag lines from Tepe Sabz (scale 1:2). item are extremely schematic, it is possible that the geometric element includes only the vertical lines from both sides of the frame, without the central checkerboard pattern. IV. INTERPRETATION OF THE MOTIF The Khazineh Painted Style is a rather schematic representation and its meaning is not self-evident. Nevertheless, Gautier and Lampre suggested it might be interpreted as depicting human figures (1905:131). Hole, Flannery and Neely described this motif as "stylized human dancers" (1969:157), and used a naturalistic painted sherd of dancing figures from Tepe Sabz to support their argument (Hole et al. 1969:157; fig. 63:n). I agree with these observa- tions, and would like to address two more points: a. The Arrangement of the Figures in Vertical Rows: The arrangement of the dancing human figures in vertical rows is exceptional. In most cases where dancing figures are shown in Protohistoric Near Eastern art scenes, they are represented in horizon- tal rows around the vessel (see, for example, Figs. 2:5; 14; Garfinkel 1998). In such an arrangement the dancing figures create a circle around the vessel's periphery. On the other hand, the Khazineh Painted Style organisation of the figures is totally different: they are presented vertically. Hole, Flannery and Neely explained the vertical arrangement of the fig- ures literally: "standing on each others' shoulders" (1969:157). However, the examples in which four (Fig. 8:1) or five (Fig. 2:6) such units appear one on top of the other clearly indicate that a realistic interpretation is impossible. Since two basic forms of dance exist, cir- cle dance and line dance (Lange 1976:85), I suggest interpreting the Khazineh Painted Style as a graphic representation of line dancing. This looks like the traditional Near Eastern Debqa dance, in which the dancers stand shoulder to shoulder in a row, rather than in a circle. Depictions of line dance were noted at other cultures as well (Kechagia 1995). b. The Geometric Panels: No interpretation has been suggested for the geometric element near the dancing figures. However, it is worth noting that such net-covered geometric elements do appear in some naturalistic depictions of dancing (Fig. 14:2, 4). In later cylinder seal impressions of the Near East, dated to the first half of the third millennium BC, similar compositions of dancing figures and geo- metric elements have been discovered (Amiet 1980, Nos. 1351, 1354; Ben-Tor 1978:57-61, Lapp 1989: 5-6, Delougaz and Kantor 1996, pl. 154). In these cases it has been suggested that the geometric ele- ment represents a structure. Given the urban con- text of the third millennium BC, the motif has been understood as depicting dancing near a temple. If we apply the same interpretation to the Khazineh Painted Style and other naturalistic scenes (see, for example, Fig. 14:1-2, 4), the geometric elements in the scenes may represent structures. Since we now know that temples were built in the ancient Near East as early as the seventh millennium B.C. (Hauptmann 1993; Schmidt 1998), it is possible that the geometric element in the Khazineh Painted style represents a cultic structure. Fig. 13.

Tepe Gawra (Tobler 1950, pl. CXLV.398). V. CONCLUSION In this work the Khazineh Painted Style has been identified and analysed. The basis for this was a first- hand examination of a large collection of painted sherds from Tepe Sabz, as well as other items from the Deh Luran Plain, now stored at Yale University. The Khazineh Painted Style is a schematic repre- sentation of human figures performing a row dance in front of a temple, dated to the late sixth millen- nium B.C. The geographical distribution of the motif is Western Iran, mainly in the Deh Luran Plain, with a few sites in Luristan. Acknowledgements I would like to thank Professor F. Hole of the Department of Anthropology of Yale University for his kind permission to study and publish relevant data from his excavations and surveys in the Deh Luran Plain. I benefited greatly from discussions with him, as well as from his technical assistance. Drs. Annie Caubet and Agnes Benoit, curators of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, Musee du Louvre, enabled me to examine the original painted pottery excavated by Gautier and Lampre. Dr. P.R.S. Moorey of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford has drawn my attention to important references. G.
