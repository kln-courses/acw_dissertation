<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 8. No. 4, December 1994 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE: JEAN D'ORMESSON'S ATTACK ON "APATHEIA" AS A QUALITY OF GOD Peter G. Christensen In their "Preface" to Radical Theology and the Death of God, Thomas J. J. Altizer and William Hamilton provide a useful list of ten ways in which the "death of God" had been understood over the past half-dozen years. The items fall under three broad headings: (a) God never existed or no longer exists; (b) the idea of God or the Christian story of redemption or theological language in general needs a major reformulation; and (c) the death of either false gods or of Jesus on the cross is a type of revelation to be embraced.1 The second of these three categories offers a means of contextualizing Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre (1980), the sorely neglected 489-page sixth novel of the French Academician, Jean D'Ormesson. In order to confront the necessity of saving humankind from potential despair at the death of God, D'Ormesson recounts God's life story, thereby asking us to redefine our notion of the Christian God. He foregrounds God's interaction with Lucifer, the war in heaven glimpsed in the apocryphal book of Enoch, and he invokes Dante, Milton, and Chateaubriand as his predeces sors. However, D'Ormesson does not mention that unlike these earlier defenders of orthodoxy, his own project must be understood as antithetical to mainstream Christianity. This revisionism was lost on the critics, and Alain Clerval, reviewing the novel for La Nouvelle Revue Française even misread the novel as a homage to literature disguised as an apology for Christianity.2 Actually, D'Ormesson abandons the Aristotelian God inherited by Christianity to give us a God of suffering, feeling and imagination, one who is not encased in stony immobility or concerned with the continual submission of humans to law and obedience. D'Ormesson also avoids making God human only through the sending of His Son.3 The novel nominally accepts Christian revelation, but Christ is not central to its concerns.4 D'Ormesson interweaves cosmic and earthly plot strands so that we can see God's emotional life on a continuum with that of his creations. Although God is indeed the protagonist of the novel, Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre does not © Oxford University Press 1994</page><page sequence="2">406 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE have the bipartite structure implied by the title. The novel is divided into six unequal sections: (i) le chaos, (2) la révolte des anges, (3) le rêve de Dieu, (4) l'histoire, (5) la fin des temps, and (6) la création. The narrator's descrip tions of God, his interactions with Lucifer, his imaginative projections, and the creation of the world constitute part of the plot in each section. In fact, the short third, fifth, and sixth sections are almost entirely concerned with this cosmic level of action. In the three longer sections D'Ormesson teases out on the earthly level in non-chronological order two plots mostly centered on the period 1768—1848. The more extensive of the two plots deals with the French Romantic writer, François-René de Chateaubriand, novelist, Christian apologist, diplomat, and famous lover of women. The second plot strand follows the bandit activities of the Afro-Frenchman David and the hunchbacked Eugénie Moucheron, a French village girl with whom he runs off in the first decade of the nineteenth century. They form a team of bandits engaged in a Promethean revolt against God and an unjust world order. Through manipulations of events and dates, the story of these two characters intersects the lives of Chateaubriand and his lovers at several points, thus providing a narrative line of great complexity, not to mention a love story foreseen by God since the beginning of time. D'Ormesson claims that love is the chief motivating force of history, that there is no love without pain, and that God has loved Lucifer and suffered pain. In his effort to revitalize the concept of God by exploring his emotional life, D'Ormesson takes on three major objections to God which have pro moted atheism and the recent 'death-of-God' philosophies: God's apparent inhumanity, the importance of obedience over creativity, and the difficulty of reconciling free will with divine omniscience. D'Ormesson's rejection of the unfeeling God leads him to promote a God for whom emotional love is central as it is in human life, a God whose creativity and continual evolution serve as a ground and justification for human acts of creation and self creation. This God of feeling and creativity does not block the operation of human free will. In his influential The Crucified God, first published in 1973, just before D'Ormesson began work on Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre, Jürgen Moltmann discusses at length the first of these issues, God's apparent inhumanity, in an attempt to rescue Christianity from the accusation that God exists in a stony indifference to human life. According to Moltmann, early Christianity, fol lowing an Aristotelian and Platonic worldview, adopted the doctrine of God's apatheia as a kind of overcompensation for the anthropomorphism of the Greek and other Mediterranean gods. Apatheia means "incapable of being affected by outside influences, incapable of feeling, as is the case with dead things, and the freedom of the spirit from inner needs and external damage".</page><page sequence="3">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 407 The physical unchangeableness and psychological insensitivity of apatheia stand in opposition to the needs, compulsions, and unwilled suffering of pathos. The pathos of the Greek gods was intricately connected to their capricious and vengeful activities, and early Christians did not want to run the risk of treating God as the auctor malorutn.5 Thus early Christian thinkers presented God as One to whom nothing can happen to make him suffer. However, when hate and envy as characteristics of God were thrown out, so too were love, compassion, and mercy. In effect, Moltmann summarizes a position that had already been expressed by Nicholas Berdyaev before the recent 'death of God' discussions. According to Berdyaev in The Destiny of Man human thought has failed to address God's inner life, and thus God has been misunderstood: The static conception of God as actus purus having no potentiality and completely self-sufficient is a philosophical, Aristotelian, and not a biblical conception. The God of the Bible, the God of the revelation, is by no means an actus purus: He has affective and emotional states, dramatic developments in His inner life, inward movement—but all this is revealed exoterically. It is extraordinary how limited is the human conception of God. Men are afraid to ascribe to Him inner conflict and tragedy characteristic of all life, the longing for His "other", for the birth of man, but have no hesitation in ascribing to Him anger, jealousy, vengeance and other affective states which, in man, are regarded as reprehensible.6 For both Berdyaev and Moltmann the appropriate response to the alienation of humankind caused by apatheia as a God-ideal can be found without totally jettisoning Christianity. Moltmann offers us the trinitarian theology of the cross7, and Berdyaev diminishes the space between humans and God by stressing the creative drive in both God and humans. D'Ormesson's response to God's apatheia departs from both Moltmann and Berdyaev in his attempt to solve the problem outside of a Christian frame work. Instead of stressing the suffering of the Crucifixion, D'Ormesson takes the more unusual route of presenting God's betrayed love for Lucifer as a human tragedy. In this scenario, God is more than horrified or indignant at Lucifer's actions; he is the prototype of the spurned lover who refuses to stop mourning even after his loss. However, because D'Ormesson does not present God as a monarch obsessed with total obedience, he allows room for Berdyaev's notion of the importance of creativity as a drive by which God's creatures come to understand God. At the beginning of the first section of the novel, "Le chaos", God is scarcely God as we know Him, for he has not yet suffered. No evil has been conceived of, for only the infinite God exists: "il était solitude parmi la solitude" and "absence dans l'absence".8 God chooses to love, and so trans</page><page sequence="4">408 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE ports of divine love sweep away the void. Love holds in its closed fist the keys of the future and the past and it always involves suffering. After the creation of Lucifer (before there is either time or space) God retires into himself and he foresees future events on the not yet created earth, such as the bloody periodic invasions of barbarian hordes and the restoration of the Catholic religion in France arranged by Napoleon. In addition, he sees the love affairs which involve suffering and bring out the most intensely felt moments of existence. ... il vit Delphine Allait [Hortense's mother] dans Notre-Dame de Paris, le 18 avril 1802, entre le comte d'Antraigues et Napoléon Bonaparte, il vit Maria sur son pont, il vit Omar [David's father] à fond de cale, il vit l'empéreur Alexis et l'amie Nane, et Emma Bovary, et Charlotte de Jussat, et Odette en train de faire catleya avec l'inepte Forcheville derrière les volets clos de la me La Perouse où frappait en vain Charles Swann ... (32) God pauses before this, his dream of the misery and glory of history. Since he is an eternal present, the narrator really cannot locate God's hesitation in linear time. Out of Lucifer's love for God comes time, the world, suffering, history, lying, evil, and all happiness, for happiness and suffering are the two sides of love. Lucifer does not wish to be the only being to love God; he wants other creatures to exist to do the same. God is not self-righteous: he loves those who disobey him more than those who obey him, because he is looking toward his own self-sacrifice. God already knows that Lucifer's love will lead to rebellion, although Lucifer himself does not realize this. Nevertheless, God does not rein in his feelings. D'Ormesson quotes Oscar Wilde's "For each man kills the thing he loves" to explain Lucifer's actions. Then both Lucifer and God grow silent. D'Ormesson explains God's silence by asking us to understand that God's death is also God's glory. Pourquoi Dieu se taisait-il? Il se taisait parce qu'il savait que l'amour de Lucifer serait la mort de Dieu. Mais il savait aussi déjà que, par un stupéfiant miracle, Lucifer, en effet, aurait raison à la fin des temps et que la mort de Dieu serait la gloire de Dieu. Miracle? Mais non: nécessité. Car comment Lucifer n'aurait il pas raison? Puisque Lucifer était aussi Dieu lui-même. Il était un autre chemin de Dieu. Le plus long, le plus cruel, le plus contradictoire, mais aussi le plus beau ... (77) In order to overcome the problem of God's willing evil, D'Ormesson insists that Lucifer is being burned by a love which is stronger than love, and he maintains as well that all humans are bom of love, no matter how soiled or atrocious sexual conception may be. However much it is involved with</page><page sequence="5">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 409 caprice, bestial instinct, or duty, conception is still love. The narrator considers the creation of the heavenly hosts as a reflection of the love between God and Lucifer. This era (which is paradoxically still outside of time) is/was the Golden Age of Heaven. God is not constituted as a creature who would will not to feel. The plans of God from the beginning contain the plans of Lucifer against the plans of God. Sin, evil, grace, providence, and destiny are all one. They penetrate and absorb each other. Lucifer dominates history because God has willed it.9 The narrator believes that he should defend Lucifer to some extent because Lucifer's defiance is still a path to God. When D'Ormesson presents the death of God as the glory of God and refuses to condemn Lucifer totally, he is working less from a tradition of Nietzchean revolt against God as it may first appear than from the conception of God as a dialectical process. In his sympathetic discussion of the long tradition behind the dialectical concept of God, John Macquarrie writes, as soon as "God posits another than himself, he has put a limit on his own being, including his power"10. This other could not be perfect or it would be a second God. That which is finite is necessarily imperfect. We see one version of the God of dialectical process in Hegel's philosophy of Spirit moving forward by a process of self-estrangement or negation.11 We also find it in Schelling's dialectical concept of the bipolar God. Schelling, in the words of Paul Tillich, asserted "a real conflict within the absolute, whereby the divine self became separated from that within God which is not God himself, from the ground, from nature in God".12 The "absolute synthesis posits an endless series of relative syntheses, but also it endlessly recalls them to absoluteness".13 Altizer writes in The Gospel of Christian Atheism about this dialectical process: What can it mean to speak of the Christian God as a dialectical process rather than as an existent Being? First, it means that the Christian God cannot be known as an unchanging, an unmoving, or an impassive Being; nor can he be understood as possessing a common nature or substance that remains eternally the same throughout his revelatory and redemptive acts. ... The God who acts in the world and history is a God who negates himself, gradually but decisively annihilating his own original Totality. God is that Totality which "falls' or "descends," thereby moving ever more fully into the opposite of its original identity.14 Altizer connects the God or process with the Christian tradition, exploring the concept that "only the Christian can know the God who is Wholly Other, for only a life in Christ can make real the fruits of God's self negation". D'Ormesson, however, is not interested in following the Nietzschean argument we see in Altizer whereby God's metamorphosis makes</page><page sequence="6">4io DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE him end up as the divine Judge and Executioner whose death we are forced to announce. Such a view gives inadequate attention to the creation of history itself, which D'Ormesson locates in God's love for Lucifer and in Lucifer's inevitable fall. We should not imagine God and Lucifer as two characters confronting each other face to face. Their "encounter" takes place entirely in God's mind. God is at the heart of Lucifer, and Hell burns in God. In the revolt of the angels originate all wars and violence. Lucifer is a creature of desire, love, and evil, perhaps of good, and desire is another name for history. Both the war in heaven and the history of humankind reflect the war of good against evil. The dragons painted by Pisanello and Carpaccio as well as Grendel and Geryon are all images of Lucifer. At the end of the second section Lucifer has a meeting with God, which D'Ormesson compares to the encounter of the thesis and antithesis in the Hegelian dialectic. It produces "cette unité active qui ne vit que des differ ences", holding in balance the positive and negative, the right and the left, the good and the evil. Indeed, for Mark C. Taylor in Altarity (1987), in Hegel's philosophy, "identity is the working-through of difference". Lucifer tells his followers that humans will have difficulty distinguishing good from evil, and that they will all claim that God is on their side. D'Ormesson resists the idea that we cannot distinguish evil from good, but he offers the dialectic as an explanation of why the difference may often be so hard to discern. Rather than promoting passive acceptance of evil on earth, D'Ormesson asks us to imagine a future reconciliation of good and evil on a cosmic scale. "La fin des temps" offers us a climactic scene between God and Lucifer when Lucifer again comes to confront God. Lucifer tells him that history is just another name for the death of God. He claims God's throne so that he can rule over eternity just as he has ruled over human history. At this outburst St. George drops his lance. As God answers, St. George picks it up. Soon the page15 divides into two columns. In the left-hand column Lucifer is repulsed by God. He penetrates the earth and forms Vesuvius and the Krakatoa volcano. Then he descends into the depths of Dante's Inferno. In contrast, in the right-hand column, God and Lucifer are reconciled at last. God tells Lucifer in words that echo the quoted passage much earlier in the novel: Tu as été un autre chemin de Dieu, le plus long, le plus cmel, le plus contra dictoire, Mail il était nécessaire, parce que c'était celui des hommes. Je vais te dire le grand secret que tu as déjà deviné obscurément et qui m'a fait souffrir: tu étais une part de la gloire de Dieu. Tu étais Dieu contre Dieu. Tu ne pouvais pas être l'universel ni la totalité. Tu as été l'inspirateur de l'histoire et de l'homme qui sont le champ de bataille de moi-même contre moi-même. Mais je t'aime comme j'aimé les hommes. Ta haine était encore de l'amour. Et tu es sauvé par l'amour que tu croyais haïr, mais qui est plus fort que la haine. (480-1)</page><page sequence="7">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 411 Lucifer is pardoned, and, disposing of his own shadows, he takes his place for eternity in the greater shadow of God Almighty.16 Although the two columns have a theoretically equal weight, the general tone of the novel supports the right-hand column. The theme that hate is a form of love has already been expressed, as has the idea that although Lucifer is bad, he provides a route toward the good. Hate always has obscure roots in love, as do cruelty, violence, and the thirst for power. At one point D'Ormesson says that God "était lui-même la haine de Dieu, l'indifférence à son propre égard et la conviction de son inexistence".17 When Lucifer either goes to hell for eternity or resumes his place in heaven near God, human history ends, since the conflict between good and evil is over. In God, however, and in His dream the image of the formidable adventure of human life remains. The last section, "La création" begins with the lines, "Dieu regardait le monde qui n'était pas encore que son rêve". What we have just read cannot be understood in a human time frame and so may be described as a dream of God. The novel closes with the lines: Alors, la voix de Dieu retentit dans son rêve. Il dit: Que la lumière soit! Et la lumière fut. Et il y eut quelque chose au lieu de rien. DÉBUT The Début at the end of the novel is not the beginning of history again, as there is no history except in the struggle of good and evil. We await the possibility of God dreaming humans and their dreaming of him in return. D'Ormesson gives here a version of the coincidentia oppositorum, but in this case the opposites are not the flesh and the spirit, nor even of the sacred and the profane. Since Lucifer is also spirit and takes part in sacredness, there is no need for an apocalypse which is a working out of the climax of Christian redemption. However, here an observer such as Moltmann would remark that D'Ormesson allows no room for a version of liberation theology based on the political dimension of the crucifixion of Christ. D'Ormesson's preference for the idea of a suffering God rather than a suffering Christ as a response to death-of-God pessimism leads him to express greater concern for the creative sphere of life than for the moral. More important to D'Ormesson than attributing to God a moral code to be obeyed is an acceptance of what an idea of God offers for him personally as a dreamer and writer. At the end of the first section, D'Ormesson suddenly writes that he is composing at his work-table under the eye of God. He confesses that he really does not know if God exists or not.18 However, this state of doubt</page><page sequence="8">412 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE does not bother him or change the nature of evil, for he speaks only of his dreams, and God is part of those dreams. D'Ormesson maintains that every thing imaginary is real, and thus God is real even if he is only imagined. D'Ormesson cries out: Je suis une partie de quelque chose qui n'est peut-être qu'un rêve, mais qui me dépasse et me comprend. C'est cet ensemble que j'appelle Dieu. Je ne me suis pas créé moi-même. C'est lui qui m'a créé. Je le remercie. Et je l'adore. Il m'est beaucoup plus proche que la bataille de Marignan, que les querelles de l'arianisme, que le Popocatapetl, que la cantilène de saint Eulalie, que le traité de Verdun. Il est le tout. Je lui appartiens. Il me laisse libre. Je lui rends grace. (103) Earlier in the novel God dreams of humans, and here we have come full circle with a man dreaming of God. People do not need God as much for understanding the nature of things as for dreaming and hoping. Although the narrator is a sceptic who claims to believe in almost nothing at all, he asks God to pardon him for wanting to think everything. In order for him to succeed with this novel he knows that he will have to be either God or Lucifer. However, since the life of God is a novel, and God is the greatest novelist, there appears to be some hope for his grandiose project. Lucifer contributes to God's novel because he is the one who wants a theatre for God and leads God to create the earth. Although he never states it directly, the narrator implicitly believes that to understand God you need to participate in creation. This idea has been expressed in Nicholas Berdyaev's classic works beginning with The Meaning of the Creative Act and reprised in his later book The Destiny of Man: The ethics of creativeness is different from the ethics of redemption: it is concerned in the first place with values and not with salvation. The moral end of life is for it not the salvation of one's soul or the redemption of guilt but creative realization of righteousness and of values which need not belong to the moral order.19 Because of D'Ormesson's stress on creativity rather than on obedience to divine law, Christ, who fulfills the law, is not central to the novel. Salvation for humankind is only a secondary interest at best. Instead, art itself offers salvation by making the creators of art godlike. The narrator at times lavishly praises great artists for their contributions to society, and we are reminded that we look at great artists not as representatives of their time but for their own personal statements. At various points in the novel we have litanies and lists of D'Ormesson's favourite artists. D'Ormesson is not concerned with whether Chateaubriand obeys moral laws or not. He is impressed by his part in the creation of the values of the Romantic Era and in the unique way he combined values. For example,</page><page sequence="9">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 413 D'Ormesson notes that all his hfe Chateaubriand fought for two causes which did not easily go together—liberty and monarchy. He also created the legend of his own life through his famous memoirs. Because legends can manifest the creative spirit at its richest, D'Ormesson is not troubled a priori that history might blur with legend, as in the case of the bandit couple David (the Negro of Pontarlier) and his lover Eugénie Moucheron. They are the models for Italy's Red Brigades and also manifesta tions of Prometheus, Cain, and others who raise murder to the heights of legend. The narrator wittily remarks that, yes, there have been historians who have asked if David and Eugénie actually existed, just as some scholars have doubted the existence of Napoleon, but we should only ask this question of their victims to see how pointless this line of investigation is. The terrorist band must be seen as attacking God since the apatheia idea of God guarantees the unjust social order that they oppose. The narrator does not denounce their bandit activities, and the reader assumes that their revolt is well taken. The bandit plot reminds us not to jump to the conclusion that God's plan dictates that 'everything that is, is right' in this world. D'Ormesson finds the revolt against the misconceived God as the activist means to a better social order. Unfortunately, he runs the risk of falling into an extreme form of aestheticism, and he cannot escape this problem altogether by justifying the bandits. However, the space for optimism opened up by creativity offers a way of avoiding the placement of humans on what Altizer calls "the knife-edge between Angst and faith", which generally leads to the conclusion that only grace (not creativity) can liberate humans from despair.20 We have seen how D'Ormesson's rejection of the deus apathës leads him to promote a God for whom emotional love is central as it is for humans and whose creation of everything serves as a ground and justification for human acts of creation. Free of the deus apathës, D'Ormesson gives greater adherence to the possibility of human free will. In the third section, "Le rêve de Dieu", the creation of the world and humans is anticipated in brief, and Adam is given both free will and the gift of naming the works of creation. The narrator pauses here to maintain that liberty and necessity are compatible and that evil and sin are a route to God. He endorses the idea of thefelix culpa, and he applies it to Lucifer's rebellion more than to Adam's.21 He goes so far as to say that even Judas's betrayal of Christ is part of this fortunate fall since here Satan tried to outfox God, but instead God made use of him for his own purposes. Nevertheless, the narrator stops short of maintaining that evil is good. He notes that others have made this extreme claim, but he will not follow suit. Rather than indicate that evil is good, the fall of Lucifer shows that free will is granted as part of the dialectical unfolding of God, as part of universal history. D'Ormesson never defines universal history although he relies on this</page><page sequence="10">414 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE concept often in the last half of the novel. Even so, we can contextualize his use of this idea with reference to its fine exposition by Louis O. Mink in his essay, "Narrative Form as a Cognitive Instrument". Mink indicates that although the idea of universal history is at least as old as Saint Augustine's City of God, it had its heyday in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, that is, when Chateaubriand was a teenager and a young man. According to Mink, traditional universal history was not "the idea that there is a particular plot in the movement of history but the assumption that underlay all proposals to display one sort of plot or another".22 Mink indicates four characteristics and implications of the belief in universal history. First, "the ensemble of human events belongs to a single story". Second, "there is a single central subject or theme in the unfolding of the plot of history". Third, "the events of the historical process are unintelligible when seen only in relation to their immediate circumstances". Fourth, "a single and unchanging set of human capacities" exists behind "the great diversity of human events, customs, and institutions". According to Mink, although today we reject the possibility of a historiographical representation of this totality ... the very rejection presupposes the concept of the totality itself". Thus D'Ormesson may be considered more open about his presup positions in his cosmic work than today's actual historians. For D'Ormesson, there is no one particular plot, a plot that has been determined in advance. Instead, he works from the assumption that all possible plots are the working out of the love and creativity guaranteed to creation through God's emotional nature. These plots are the various manifestations of the conflict between God and Lucifer. Love is the unchanging human capacity in which this conflict is rooted. Love, which contains hate as a kind of shadow, leads to suffering and is responsible for the movement from one generation to another. We understand that good contains evil through the crucial analogy that love contains hate. Love as creative potential keeps each individual life from being lived as a pawn in the struggle between good and evil. Not surprisingly the Chateaubriand-related plot culminates in an act of love. Hortense Allart, who was with Chateaubriand in Rome during Easter 1829, shares a night of love with the fictional character Julien Pontarlier in the Prado in Madrid in 1832. Fictional and real characters once again interact, a symbol of human creativity in a double sense. (Earlier in the novel the narrator had weighed differing opinions as to whether Stendhal or his charac ter Robert from the opening pages of La Chartreuse de Parme was more likely to have been Hortense Allart's father.) The night of love of Hortense and Julien not only remind us of the centrality of love to D'Ormesson's scheme but also unites the Chateaubriand plot with the David—Eugénie plot, since Julien is their son. Much earlier these narrative lines had crossed when we</page><page sequence="11">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 415 discovered that Chateaubriand's father had served aboard the Apollon, which had taken Omar, David's father, to the New World as a slave (c. 1770). The narrator's comment on the night of love in the Prado is one instance of the presupposition that there is just one story to tell about the past and that humans indeed do have freedom: Avant que l'histoire se fasse, elle pourrait toujours ne pas se faire. Mais une fois qu'elle s'est faite, elle est à chaque instant l'aboutissement fatal, inévitable, nécessaire de tout de qui l'a précédée. Hortense et Julien se rencontrent au. Prado d'été dans les premières années de la monarchie de Juillet parce que Dieu a créé un monde où tous, sans exception, parmi les coups de théâtre et les renversements, nous jouons chacun nos rôles avec une précision rigeureuse et une fidélité exemplaire. (447) The key roles that we play are as lovers, striving for completion in a relationship with something outside of ourselves. This scene offers the first of three closures for the novel. A second ending takes us to a bridge where two characters mentioned in passing several times in the novel, Pierre and Maria, are waiting. Instead of telling us what happens to these characters whom we scarcely know, D'Ormesson allows us to choose an ending of our own free will. They may become rich and famous or they may remain poor and unknown. Pierre may kill Maria or vice versa. Or they may die together in each others' arms. The reason for this free open-endedness is that Pierre and Maria are images of ourselves. The reader constitutes the real hero of the novel, for the reader, like Pierre and Maria or Chateaubriand, is a part of God. Aussi Pierre et Maria deviendront-ils ici ce que vous voudrez qu'ils deviennent. Et ce que vous êtes devenus. Ou ce que vous deviendrez. Ils glisseront dans le plaisir ou dans la foi, dans l'héroïsme, dans le désespoir. Ils feront peut-être fortune, ils perdront tout d'un seul coup, ils lutteront pour la justice, ils découvri ront d'autres mondes, ils seront la proie des passions où ils les susciteront chez les autres, ils s'opposeront à la violence où ils s'en serviront. Ou peut-être, tout simplement, passeront-ils leur temps à s'aimer: ce qui, n'en deplaise à d'aucuns, ne serait déjà pas si mal. (455) Again the centrality of loving to D'Ormesson's universal history emerges. Pierre and Maria will go on to die, as all people do. However, there will be children, not just God or totality or nothingness at the end of their fives. The cycle of love will begin again with new participants. Having concluded "L'histoire" on this note, the narrator of the fifth section, "La fin du temps", offers us a tour-de-force ending of the plot centered on God and Lucifer in which universal history is related to the Apocalypse in a surprising way. Beginning with Easter Sunday 1802, a key date in "La révolte des anges", a long fist of things forgotten is recited. This</page><page sequence="12">416 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE litany prompts the narrator to speak of this state of non-remembering as a version of the Apocalypse: Beaucoup s'imaginent que l'Apocalypse est le récit imaginaire de la fin de notre monde : elle est bien plutôt une image fabuleuse et mythique de l'histoire universelle. De même que toute histoire avec ses détails les plus infimes figure, dès l'origine, dans le rêve de Dieu avant la création, de même—et inversement— l'Apocalypse éclate, sans un instant de retard, avec la naissance du temps qu'elle illustre et refuse avec férocité. Dès le premier cri de l'univers, ou peut-être même avant, l'histoire du monde n'est rien d'autre que l'histoire de la fin du monde. La fin est dans le début; le début déjà fait partie de la fin. ... Le jugement demier se confond dans l'éternité avec la révolte des anges et avec la création. (465) Thus the "fin des temps" announced in the section title is not the conclusion of this story. In the one page final section "La création" God creates light, and the whole cycle begins again—except that the beginning and end were always part of each other, and it is a simplification to say that this new creation follows the one at the beginning of the novel. Since the history of the world is the same as the history of the end of the world, we have a further working out of the idea expressed by Schelling in his essay on human freedom of 1809 and quoted by Moltmann, "Every being can be revealed only in its opposite. Love only in hatred, unity only in conflict".23 By use of the dialectical principle, D'Ormesson tries to get rid of the objection which has always been a problem with Thomas Aquinas's defense of free will, generally recognized as the most effective non-dialectical defense.24 Some of Aquinas's difficulties are evaluated by Joseph C. Moskop in a study which is basically sympathetic to him. The main objection to the reconciliation of the two ideas of God's omniscience and human free will has usually been the claim that if God knows that an event x will happen, then it will happen. If God's knowledge is perfect and located in the past, then it presumably makes human actions known by him necessary. Moskop states: In reply to this objection, Thomas argues that the statement "God knows that x will happen" is false, since all events are eternally present to the divine gaze. With this response Thomas appears to reject the view that God has foreknowledge of worldly events. Thomas defines eternity as the mode of existence of the immutable, but he offers no clear answer to the question whether the divine eternity should be viewed as timeless existence (existence "outside of time") or everlasting existence (existence at all times). The interpretation of eternity as everlasting existence permits a sense of foreknowledge, since it implies that God's knowledge of an event is at a prior time to the event's occurrence in the world. In order, therefore, to avoid the conclusion that all events are rendered</page><page sequence="13">PETER G. CHRISTENSEN 417 necessary by divine foreknowledge, Thomas must commit himself to the view that God's knowledge is timeless, lacking any temporal relation to the events known.25 The two alternatives described by Moskop develop from the given premise of God's immutability. To abandon the idea of God as immutable seems to be the best way of offering an alternative version of the reconciliation of divine omniscience and human freedom. This is the route taken by the contemporary philosopher Charles Hartshorne, who has been pursuing this problem in his writings over many years from Beyond Humanism (1937) to Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (1984). According to Moskop, Hartshorne feels that immutable knowledge is a less than perfect state: In contrast to Thomas, then, Hartshorne rejects the ascription of the predicates 'timeless', 'immutable', 'independent', 'cause', 'creator', 'infinite', 'necessary', and 'simple' exclusively to God (in their absolute sense) and the contrary predicates exclusively to the world. Rather, Hartshorne bases his idea of God on the thesis that the relative or changeable must be attributed to God in addition to the absolute, immutable, and independent. Hartshorne, then, seeks to ascribe the predicates in both of the above sets of contraries to God. (69) Hartshorne's version of the bipolar conception of God is still being debated. For Moskop, one of the thorniest problems raised in connection with it is whether it will fit successfully into the relativity theory that it nominally embraces.26 It may at first appear that D'Ormesson has chosen the route of Aquinas over that of his own contemporary Hartshorne because of the analogy that his novel makes between God and the author. However, this view does not hold up, as it is based on a "closed" notion of authorship, and, as we have seen D'Ormesson refuses to definitively close either the cosmic story (two endings) or the story of Pierre and Maria (open to the reader's taste). Actually, D'Ormesson is closer to Hartshorne than to Aquinas since in the novel the conception of God's power (probably more eternal than timeless), and human free will are certainly not pitted against each other as unreconcil able objects. The human being takes part in the life of mind, in Hegel's term, not just the summons to obedience. A passage from Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind quoted by Moltmann's is useful here: But the life of mind is not one that shuns death, and keeps clear of destmction; it endures death and in death manifests its being. It only wins to its truth when it finds itself utterly torn asunder. It is this mighty power, not by being a positive which turns away from the negative, as when we say of anything it is nothing or it is false, and, being then done with it, pass on to something else: on the contrary, mind is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and</page><page sequence="14">418 DIEU, SA VIE, SON OEUVRE dwelling with it. This dwelling beside it is the magic power that converts the negative into being.27 This magic power may now be less available to the systematic theologian than to the novelist when it comes to presenting the positive which does not turn away from the negative. It may be too easy to turn humans into the puppets of God through a theological discourse which does not have the bravado to put itself into God's mind. Thus D'Ormesson's cosmic novel should be appreciated as a work of theology in a world where the loss of appeal of systematic theology has gone hand in hand with the anxiety over the death of God. The criticisms directed at Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre could be those aimed at those who wish to jettison the God of apatheia in general. God may seem to be the author of evil, and the world may lose its moral and political ideals as well. After all, Schelling admitted that since evil is "undeniably real at least as a general contrast, there can indeed be no doubt from the outset that it was necessary for God's revelation".28 D'Ormesson cannot entirely solve these problems, but who in his tradition has entirely solved them? Instead, we might do better to point out a key weakness of the novel when we take it on its own terms: its failure to show adequately the necessary interconnect edness of love and hate. The only developed example we see of this is in Lucifer's revolt. We need to have either a strong demonstration of this among the characters around Chateaubriand or some more philosophical discussion of this issue. Also, to say with D'Ormesson that there are traces of love in the Discours sur la Méthode, industrial civilization, and the squares of Casimir Malevich seems to stretch the idea of love beyond its usefulness as a concept and thus jeopardize his idea of the universal history of love. On the theological level D'Ormesson's achievement in his novel is to shed light on the various notions of the death of God listed by Altizer at the beginning of this essay. For D'Ormesson God has not died in the Nietzschean sense that Altizer himself feels. Instead, the current crisis of the death of God is rooted in a misconception of the nature of God. Thus D'Ormesson, while preserving a dialectical approach with strong roots in Western Christianity, by focusing on God and Lucifer rather than on Christ, offers a more ecumen ical approach to overcoming the sense that humans have outlived God.29 Department of English, Marquette University, Milwaukee REFERENCES The author wishes to thank Dr Brad Hinze, Department of Theology, Marquette Univer sity, for his bibliographic suggestions. 1 Thomas J.

Other brief reviews of the novel, even enthusiastic ones, fail to illuminate its thesis. Jean-Louis Ezine's conversation with D'Ormesson mentions Michel Tournier's lavish praise of Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre. Tournier humor ously suggested that he and D'Ormesson create an association for the defense of the Church and religion. Michel Mohrt, whom D'Ormesson was later to welcome into the Académie Fran çaise, was also impressed by the novel. In briefer notices, Angelo Rinaldi was hostile and Bertrand Poirot-Delpech favourable. Jean-Didier Wolframm, who had been unenthusiastic about La Gloire de l'empire, had more admiration for the later novel. 3 D'Ormesson moves in a direction opposite of today's negative, or apophatic theology, which affirms the absolute transcendance of God to the point of excluding any pos sibility of identifying him with any human concept. See, John Meyendorff, Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes. 2nd Ed. (New York: Fordham U.P., 1987), p. il. 4 D'Ormesson's interview with Jean-Edern Halber offers some further comments on Dieu, sa vie, son oeuvre, but not as many as one would wish. D'Ormesson contex tualizes the novel with reference to arian ism rather than dialectical theology. Although today Christ has a bigger role in the popular imagination than God the Father, for the Arians it was the reverse. They felt that the Son was not consubstan tial with the Father but created by the Father at the origin of time. D'Ormesson thinks that his novel, with its stress on the Father, has an arian touch to it. As in the novel, D'Ormesson calls God the totality of the universal. He feels that he is not out to convert anyone. When asked if he believes in God, he reminded Halber of Balzac calling for Horace Bianchon on his deathbed: whatever is real exists. D'Ormesson denies having a purely aes thetic notion of history. For him, history is both a game and a drama. Insofar as it is drama it engages our serious actions. D'Ormesson believes that we must con tinue to work for human rights. The games he plays with history do not lead to political quietism.

Kojeve's Desire seems to be quite a viol ence-laden concept. D'Ormesson, in stress ing Desire as passionate love, may be both attracted and repelled by this idea.

Nichols Jr. (New York: Basic Books, 1969), p. 40. 18 Iris Murdoch in The Sovereignty of Good over Other Concepts (1967) also speaks of the necessity of keeping the idea of God even if one does not actually believe in God. Although this belief is similar to D'Ormes son's, Murdoch works out of the Platonic, non-dialectical tradition at odds with D'Ormesson. 19 Berdyaev, The Destiny of Man. p. 133. 20 Altizer and Hamilton, Radical Theology and the Death of God. p. 109. 21 D'Ormesson pays little attention to Adam and Eve in his idea of the Fall. This approach may reflect the heritage of Irenaeus. According to John Hick, Berdyaev is a recent heir to the tradition of Irenaeus (c. 130-c. 202), according to which "man is a creature made initially in the 'image' of God and gradually being brought through his own free responses into the divine 'likeness.' " For Berdyaev, Creation is the Alpha moving toward the Omega, and every moment of time is eschatological. See, John Hick, Evil and the God of Love (London: Macmillan, 1966), p. 223. 22 Louis O.
