CanLit may play a major role in Canada's cultural economies, but it has become apparent that its study can no longer take place in isolation from the larger forces that shape the nation, global relations and the corporatization of higher education. The task of identifying the implications of these shifts and, above all, of devising constructive ways of responding to them involves a long-term and multilateral project that can only be a shared endeavour, undertaken in interdisciplinary and collaborative terms. Current transnational forces have destabilized the "national myth" established in the 1960s and 1970s. Such questions as "is Canada post-colonial?" intersect with formulations such as "multicultural citizenship," "white civility" or "recovering Canada" in ways that require new mappings of a shifting field. We invite ^ submissions that critically examine the disciplinary and institu- JM tional frameworks within which Canadian literature is produced, disseminated and taught from an interdisciplinary perspective. ► Submission Deadline: March 1, 2008 xWF *** To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Canadian Literature, we are planning several special issues in 2009: Literary journals, Canadian Writing y Submission Deadline: May 1, 2008 One of these will focus on the past and future of the literary-critical journal in Canada, and on similar journals focusing on Canada from outside the country. We invite submissions on all aspects of the literary journal as it shapes, or is shaped by, Canadian writing. Canadian Literatura and Sports, Guest Editor Laurie Ricou y Submission Deadline: August 1, 2008 In recognition of Vancouver 2010, the Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Canadian Literature proposes to publish a special issue devoted to "Canadian Literature and Sport." We welcome any submissions that embrace the two elements of this topic. An Olympic or winter sport connection is not essential. www.canlit.ca/call</page><page sequence="10">MovingWorlds is a forum for creative work as well as criticism, literary as well as visual texts, writing in scholarly as well as more personal modes, in English and translations into English.

Some essays highlight the interrelationship between literature and other dis- ciplines, cultural climates, topical issues, recent discoveries, or divergent art forms and modes of creative activity. Mosaics essays also explore emerging trends in theory and literary criticism and address the nature and scope of interdisciplinary study itself. Of the four issues the journal publish- es each year, at least one is a special issue that addresses a topic of contemporary concern. Submission Essays must be submitted on disk, preferably in Microsoft Word, along with three double-spaced and single-sided hard copies. The hard copies and disk must include a 50-word abstract. Please use standard margins and number the pages. Mosaic's blind peer-review process requires that the author's name, as well as postal and e-mail addresses, appear on covering letters; it is important that no identifying information appear on either the hard copy or the electronic version of the essay itself. Covering letters must state that the essay is not part of a thesis or dissertation, has not been published previously, and is not being considered for publication in another journal or medium. Manuscripts will not be returned. Preferred length of essays is 6,500 words, to a maximum of 7,500 words. Parenthetical citations and works cited must follow the conventions of the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing , 2nd edition. Mosaic does not print endnotes or footnotes. Essays may be in English or French and may feature illustrations. If an essay is accepted for publication, securing artwork and permissions for illustrations is the sole responsibility of the author.
