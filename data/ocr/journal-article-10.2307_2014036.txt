<plain_text><page sequence="1">MECHANICAL EXPLANATION: ITS MEANING AND APPLICABILITY I SINCE explanation involves entities in relations, for to explain a given phenomenon is to subsume it under a known law and law asserts correlation between variables, there are two questions about mechanical explanation which we must consider: (1) What is mechanical relation? and (2) What is the nature of mechanical en- tities? *The mechanical relation is obviously a non-purposive type of causal relation, a relation in which, given the condition, the phe- nomenon in question follows, and, removing the condition, it ceases to follow.</page><page sequence="2">MECHANICAL EXPLANATION 15 To define the nature of mechanical entity or entities is not, how- ever, so simple a task. Most liberally the mechanical entities may be defined as perceptual. Jennings, in distinguishing mechanism from vitalism, points out that in mechanism "later perceptual di- versities . . . are always preceded'by earlier perceptual diversi- ties. "' In this definition mechanical entities are taken to be per- ceptual. It is usual, however, to explain "perceptual diversities" as physico-chemical entities. But what does one mean by physico- chemical entities? C. D. Broad finds five distinct meanings applied to these entities. Two of his interpretations involve "macroscopic" (i.e., perceptual) entities. A third one involves "heterogeneous microscopic" (i.e., imperceptual) entities, and the last two inter- pretations involve the most rigid form of " homogeneous micro- scopic" entities.2 As to the possibility of the reduction of the macroscopic to the microscopic entities Broad writes as follows: "It is useless to say that perhaps the differences between an atom of oxygen and one of hydrogen are merely differences between the number and configura- tion of two different groups of precisely similar particles, whose laws are mechanically analysable. Perhaps they are. But since chemistry has no need to make any assumptions on the question one way or the other, the success of the atomic theory up to the present can have no tendency to support this view, and therefore can reflect no credit on homogeneous or pure mechanism. "3 Though pure mechanism with its perfect homogeneity represents the simplest con- ceivable assumption as to entities, Broad remarks that pure mech- anism is hardly used by anyone. The electron theory, which comes nearest to it, has its positive and negative particles. Is it possible to frame a definition of mechanical entities which would bring all the different interpretations into one class? The common element of all the mechanical entities, we think, is their measurability. Physics, chemistry, and mechanics differ inter se, but in the description of the given phenomena all of them employ only such entities as can be described by the use of measurement. Mass, e.g., is defined by the physicist in terms of positions and mo- t-ions involving only such quantities as can be determined by the use of measurement. A unit quantity of heat is the quantity required to raise a unit mass of water one degree centigrade. A unit quantity of electricity is the quantity which acts on a similar quantity with unit force at unit distance. And a unit force is one which would impart to a unit mass a unit acceleration.

Laws of this type are called natural laws. 'Though this definition is sufficient to distinguish mechanical explanation from other types of explanation, such, e.g., as purposive or vitalistic, where non-causal relations or non-measurable entities are used, it should be observed that the me- chanical ideal is more rigorous. The ideal mechanical explanation is an attempt to arrange the laws of nature in a series of subsump- tions of such a kind that we might regard each law as capable of reduction to the more elemental, until at last we come to the laws cmployed by mechanics, i.e., Newton's three laws of motion or some substitutes for them. In our present discussion, however, we shall refer to mechanical explanation in its broader meaning and will not confine ourselves to its ideal. There are three important consequences of our definition of mech- anism. In the first place mechanism, in subsuming the given phe- nomenon under laws of nature, eliminates all references to purpose. Mechanism is a non-purposive, or, using Professor Singer's term, an ateleological type of explanation.5 Its fundamental concepts are stripped of all anthropomorphic coloring. Cause, e.g., does not mean activity but uniformity of correlation according to law and law is expressed by equations that symbolize relationships between variables. Secondly, mechanism is deterministic. The fundamental assumption is that the discovered relation is bound to take place and no other can. When, e.g., we state the law of falling bodies, we do not imply merely that they happen to have the same accelera- tion, but that they must have the same acceleration. The world is so constituted that the given order can not be otherwise. It is for this reason that in a Laplacean mechanistic world, if we knew the masses, the space distribution, and the velocities at all points at any given moment we could calculate the masses, the space distribution and the velocities at all points for any other time. And, lastly, the ideal of mechanism is to present the simplest type of explanation. Mechanism attains this ideal of simplicity or economy of explanation by the reduction of the number of dimensions, viz., the independent kind of measurements. The dimensions of mechanics, e.g., are mass, length, and time, and those of thermodynamics, mass, length, time, and the additional dimension of temperature. Simplicity in explana- tion is effected if it can be shown that temperature is a function of 4Singer, E., "Note on the Physical World," this JOURNAL, Vol. 1, p. 626. 5 Singer, E., Mind as Behavior, p. 58.</page><page sequence="4">MECHANICAL EXPLANATION 17 mass, length, and time. This simplicity or economy is exactly the one that has been attained by the mechanical theory of heat, in which it is shown that temperature is a function of the velocity of certain concealed mass-motions. II So far we have considered the meaning of mechanical explanation. We shall now discuss the question of its applicability. Of the many arguments against the objective applicability of mechanism we shall consider two types, viz., epistemological and metaphysical. The epistemological arguments assert that mechanical explanation is only a subjective construction of mind for practical or theoretical purposes and has no objective validity. The metaphysical argu- ments, on the other hand, are not satisfied with indicating the role of mind in the construction of mechanism. They go further in their objections and try to show that the categories of mechanism can not grasp the nature of reality. The second type of argument is based on the distinction between the unreal and the real categories of nature. 1. The Epistemological Arguments.-The first epistemological ob- jection to mechanical explanation which we shall mention, is based on what may be called inverted pragmatism. Though mechanism and practical value are not considered identical, it is argued that practical value determines the use of mechanism as a practical sub- stitute for complete evidence. Experience is pictured as a flow or stream of sensations and elements, and scientific concepts are con- sidered merely as expedients to fill in experience. Natural laws are only economical resumes which replace for us "lengthy descrip- tions of sequences among impressions."6 They are, in the words of Mach, "mere helps to facilitate our consideration of things." 7' The knowledge gained by their help, therefore, can be of practical value only. The law of gravitation, e.g., is not Newton's discovery of an objective law that guides the motion of the planets, but his technical formulation for describing economically the sequences of sense im- pressions which are termed planetary motion. The major assumption of the theory we are considering is that experience is nothing but a stream of sensations, such as colors, sounds, pressures, etc. Causal relations, as they are non-sensational, have no objective validity. They are merely creations of the mind for practical purposes. The statement that one event is the cause of another has no other meaning than that one event is followed by another. This Humian interpretation of experience, however, is open to criticism. If mathematical or causal relations are to be 6 Karl Pearson.

The fundamental assumption of science is that experience can be ana- lyzed into entities and their relations. Without the entities or re- lations there would be nothing but confusion. It is inconsistent to put the entities in the physical world and their mathematical re- lations in the mind only, for a mathematical relation is a fact of physics, not of psychology.8 But even if we grant the theory that experience is nothing but a stream of sensations, it is difficult to understand how in such a world habits and customs are formed, or expedient, economical resumes are created, in terms of which natural laws are interpreted. The world of sensations and entities apart from their relations is a world of complete indeterminism. In such a world everything conceivable would be possible. We should require two of the three modal categories, viz., the actual and the possible, or the actual and the not yet actual. But if all things conceivable are equally likely, there is not only no reason for judging anything to be more or less possible than anything else, but no basis for forming such judg- ments. A second form of epistemological objection tries to show that mechanism is nothing but creation of mind for theoretical purposes. The objectivity of mechanical explanation is denied, and its subjec- tivity is asserted. Mechanical explanation is created by mind pri- marily as a condition for apprehension. Experience, from this second point of view, is not interpreted as a succession of sensations. Succession is only possible, it is pointed out, through the consciousness of necessity that determines the order of successive events. Causality, it is argued, is a necessary and invariable factor in all consciousness, and nothing can be ap- prehended except in terms of it. But causal laws or laws of nature are thereby not objective. They are "the very creation of our understanding acting upon the data of our senses. Such laws are not the laws of the Unknowable world at all. They hold only for the show world of our experience. Our own understanding is, therefore, the source of all knowable, rational truth."" Natural law is a "hypothesis, a postulate; an epistemological condition of the possibility of scientific experience, but not itself a fact of experience."10 And by scientific experience it is meant "the ideal of orderly and systematic knowledge in which every item has its place in virtue of universal and necessary laws."

R., this JouRNAI, Vol. XX, p. 186. 9 Royce, J., The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, p. 477. 10 Ward, J., Naturalism and, Agnosticism, Vol. II, p. 220. 11 Ibid., p. 250.</page><page sequence="6">MECHANICAL EXPLANATION 19 We do not wish to question here the major assumption of the idealist, viz., that mechanism is created by mind as a condition for apprehension, but it is worth while pointing out that the idealistic interpretation of mechanism does not remove its determinism. The world is determined in a new form. For according to idealism "our world . . . must conform to rigid laws." The mind is "bound by its own nature, . . . to regard all observed facts as conforming to laws." And as it is beyond our power or that of anyone else to alter the way in which understanding constitutes the world, laws of nature are binding, coercive, and independent of our wills and wishes. Here we have the determinism of mechanism in a different garb. 2. The Metaphysical Arguments.-The metaphysical arguments against mechanism are not content with asserting the subjectivity of mechanical explanation. They further try to show that the rigid categories of mechanical explanation can not grasp the real nature of reality. First of all, it is pointed out that reality is historic, and there- fore the non-historic categories of science can not explain it. The world is divided into two realms, one of which proves to be a mere appearance of the other. These divisions are sometimes called the "realm of nature" and the "realm of ends," or the "world of de- scription" and the "world of appreciation." From this point of view the conceptions and categories of science completely break down when compared with the purposive categories of history. Science, it is asserted is only symbolic description of reality, and is therefore unable to furnish a concrete presentment of reality. Reality is behind science. It is history and not science which can give us reality in its concreteness. "With experience in the concrete, we can deal satisfactorily in no other way," writes Ward. "In history we find no mere repetition, no absolute fixity, small scope for measurement or for mathematics, the indispensables of all scientific coKnceptions; yet though affording thus little foot- hold for positive and exact science, the historical is what we under- stand best and what concerns us most. '112 "Yes, the actual," Ward further writes, "is wholly historical." X13 In a similar way, for Royce the world of description gives way to the world of appreciation. It is in the world of appreciation, in the world of valuation, in the world of concrete history that we find the most profound truths. Scientific description is necessary but inadequate ". . . in order to make our description valid for all intelligent human beings, the fashions of our description have to be universal. We can't describe the unique, e.g., Shelley's 'sense that 12 Ibid., Vol. 1, p. 280. 13 Ibid., p. 281.</page><page sequence="7">20 JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY at the winds of spring' etc. That we have to appreciate."14 Sci- ence is, then, only a common scheme formed by eliminating the unique, the variable element, in order that all men may be able to establish understanding among themselves, in their practical rela- tions. That all existing beings are individuals or historic may be con- ceded to Ward and Royce, but this in no way contradicts the state- ment that knowledge or significant assertion with reference to any individual or historic event is in terms of non-historic abstractions, non-purposive laws or universals. The individual, apart from its determination, which is in terms of universals, is an abstraction. And if scientific concepts or mechanistic descriptions are to be re- garded as abstraction, and therefore unreal, then the characterless historic events or individuals must be relegated to the same realm. The knowledge of history, let us further note, whether in form of memory or report, meaning by the latter all knowledge communicated to one by word, an eye witness, or tradition, would be of no value unless we assumed the principles of mechanism. The truth of mem- ory-judgment, e.g., is a particular truth, and has all the limitations which such truths possess. The more complete understanding of history is attained by connecting discrete memory-judgments, by enlarging and enriching their significance, and finally by observing that they are consistent with themselves, with one another, and with such results as we derive through inference. This process of recon- struction of memory-judgment would be impossible without the as- sumption of mechanism. Reports, like memory-judgments, are iso- lated truths. Even if we could gather all that was written on stone, bronze or paper, our histories would be imperfect. We fill the lacunaT of records and evidence by means of hypotheses based on the principles of mechanical explanation. One who rejects uni- formity and determinism must confine himself to the immediate present. Finally, mechanical explanation is discredited on the ground that it is static and rigid, consequently incapable of grasping a chang- ing reality. Natural laws are, it is asserted, merely repetitions in a superficial sense. Repeat A, a cause identically the same, then B, an effect, will be repeated identically. But in the real world the character of mere repetition, as expressed by laws, is never found. Identically the same never occurs. At most, the second is similar to the first. The real world being a world of change, flux, and motion, the static concepts of mechanism can never describe it. "The inherent difficulties of metaphysics . . . arise," writes Berg- son, "from our professing to reconstruct reality-which is tendency 14 The Spirit of Modern Phitlosophy, p. 398.</page><page sequence="8">MECHANICAL EXPLANATION 21 and consequently mobile-with percepts and concepts whose func- tion it is to make it stationary.' '15 The conceptual mechanism of our ordinary knowledge, and especially of our "exact" sciences is claimed to be of a cinematographical kind. They are only snap- shots, fixed cross-sections of ceaselessly changing, unforeseeable stream of reality. James, like Bergson, emphasizes this point. "Reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will," James writes, "exceeds our logic, overflows and surrounds it-I prefer bluntly to call reality if not irrational, then at least non- rational in its constitution-and by reality here I mean reality where things happen. " "' But change, upon which Bergson and James insist, is not mere change, but explicable change-explicable in reference to something constant. As a matter of fact change is meaningless without its cor- relative constancy. Logically change is the correlation between dif- ferent moments of time and the different spatial positions of an object,17 and if we abolish constancy nothing remains of the fact of change. Professor Montague strikingly illustrates this in his parable of a race where not only the runners, but the judges, the judges' stand and even the race-track are moving without a fixed goal or direction. But by the very motion of everything, what was to have become a super-race has become utterly meaningless.18 Let us also remark that change, flux, motion, which are so sharply distinguished by Bergson and James from concepts, are concepts themselves, and if we do not identify or confuse concepts with images, but consider them as indicating relations between terms, then they become the means to understand the meaning of change. The fact of change, then, does not contradict or invalidate the concepts of the " exact " sciences. In this paper we have discussed the meaning of mechanical ex- planation and have defended it against epistemological and meta- physical arguments. There are, of course, other types of arguments against mechanism, for instance, the biological and psychological ar- guments presented by the vitalists. Thus far, however, we have found no valid reason for discarding mechanism or for considering it merely a useful fiction. Y. H. KRIKORIAN. THE C oLLGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
