<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Let me play a while now": The Hermeneutics of Heritage and William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!1 Roland Végso ABSTRACT The theoretical basis of my paper is provided by Jacques Derrida's definition of heritage, which postulates that a legacy exists only as interpreted. In Faulkner's fiction, the question of heritage manifests itself as a special constellation of four motifs: the story of the past (the "mate- rial" of heritage), the ghost of the ancestor (the symbol of heritage), the curse (the unavoidabil- ity of the task), and the game (the game of reading the heritage). These four are inseparable and always work together in the creation of inheritance. The reading of such a heritage which lacks self-identity without the act of interpretation leads in Faulkner's art, specifically in Absalom, Ab- salom!, to the creation of a ghost-land, the Old South. Reading the Heritage and the Heritage of Reading This article's reading of "heritage" is based on the assumption that the "human condition" is essentially a "reading condition." The text is the heritage, the reader is the heir, and reading is the unavoidable game. As a reading of William Faulkner's Ab- salom, Absalom/, the present article tries to show that the novel is essentially about "reading." Within these contexts the "text" is Southern heritage as it is presented through the Sutpen story; the readers are the characters in the novel (particularly Quentin and Shreve); and reading is their unavoidable game. Derrida's definition of heritage, which lends a theoretical basis to our investigations, postulates that heritage is an unavoidable "task" that nobody is exempt from,2 not even - let us add to Der- rida - the reader of Faulkner's novel. The reading of the past, this overwhelming game, is always presented as a "creative reproduction." For the player's part, the game is a temporary occupation of an authorial position. The teller of the story enjoys a cer- tain kind of freedom: he or she has the right to tell the story the way he or she wants it to be told and to fill in the gaps. (Both of these happen in Absalom, Absalom/.) "[Y]ou wait. Let me play a while now,"3 says Shreve in Absalom, Absalom/ when he wants to take over the creative reproduction of the Sutpen story. In a very similar situation, Judge Steven in A Requiem for a Nun, when he wants to take over the crea- 1 I would like to thank Zoltán Abádi-Nagy (Kossuth University, Debrecen) and Lothar Hön- nighausen (University of Bonn) for their help and support, and I am also grateful to the John F.

Let me play too."4 And the game is played because "[e]very game presents the man who plays it with a task."5 Here, the task of the (Gadamerian) game and the task of the (Derridean) heritage merge. The inescapable task of heritage presents itself to the heir as the task of the game he or she is to play with the heritage itself. Since all questions relating to exist- ence are the questions of heritage, a hermeneutics of heritage will turn into ontologi- cal (or to be more precise, hauntological) explication. No wonder that for Gadamer the game becomes the "clue to ontological explanation," whether it is an ontology of the arts of human existence. The fact that the question of heritage becomes the ques- tion of existence, which includes the questions of life and death, also explains the "tragic" treatment of the legacy as an unavoidable curse by Faulkner. If we approach the question from a broader perspective and scrutinize the problem of heritage not just within a family but as the Southern heritage, we may arrive at a similar conclusion. However, the way the family and the South are brought together in Faulkner's art is that the Southern heritage is presented through the stories of Southern families: "Every exploration of family becomes an exploration of region, and every exploration of either becomes the exploration of self."6 There have been many critical efforts to try to locate the essence of Faulkner's art in the thematic concerns with absence and loss.7 Absence appears to be a pervasive presence in Faulkner's fiction, and quite predictably, it is always language that is used to cover up this vacuum. This supplementary linguistic construction is a myth, or to be more precise, they are myths, since the Derridean plurality of ghosts requires the use of the plural. The openings of Faulkner's novels frequently demarcate sites of loss. The narratives often need to register an absence in order to get under way; it is striking to consider the number of Faulkner's works that center on funerals or recent deaths.8 Matthews then goes on to consider Soldiers' Pay, Flags in the Dust, The Sound and the Fury, Sanctuary, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, and Go Down, Moses as examples of such absence-oriented narratives which enumerate quite a number of different kinds of losses. But there is an ultimate "ghost-breeding" loss at the root of all these absences which actually binds these losses together. It is the loss no Southerner is able to overlook since they all necessarily exist in it: the lost South- ern cause.

According to Matthews, this is what Quentin is unable to accept in The Sound and the Fury, and he "recoils from the in- tuition that even memory is a kind of supplement that arises out of the breakage of immediacy, that necessarily acknowleges Visibility, spacing, death.'"9 As shown in Miss Rosa's long monologue in chapter 5, even Absalom, Absalom! questions the existence, or at least the validity, of memory: That is substance of remembering - sense, sight, smell: the muscles with which we see and hear and feel - not mind not thought: there is no such thing as memory: the brain recalls just what the muscles grope for: no more, no less: and its resultant sum is incorrect and false and worthy only of the name of dream. (AA 143) But this dream "is a might-have-been which is more true than truth" (143), or as Shreve puts it, "there are some things that just have to be whether they are or not, have to be a damn sight more than some other things that maybe are ..." (322). The myth of the Old South thus serves as a special, post-created "fore-word," a fictional space in which the legitimization of the Southern cause is possible. Out of this special sense of the loss of its own identity after the Civil War sprung the need to create "the beginner, the begetter, the origin, the absolute father"10 of all Southerners. To be more precise, it was the creation of a textual - and if Bleikasten is right - seemingly only fictional, supplement for the lost origin, the plenitude of the lost Garden of Eden. This is how the game that the heir must play with a heritage becomes "a game outmoded and played with pawns shaped too late and to an old dead pattern" (my emphasis). Here is Bleikasten again: Out of the nostalgic memories of a lost war, an imaginary South had arisen, as if to oblit- erate the real one - a collective mirage in which the old Cavalier legend is blended into the Confederate myth. . . . And out of this compelling mirage grew Southern shintoism and its wistful rituals. Probably nowhere else in America . . . was the ancestor ever held in so much reverence as he then was in the South, nor had he ever been such a powerful and omnipresent phantom (my emphasis).11 A ghost is "born" after the death of the body. The myth of the Old South is born after the Civil War, i.e., the "death" of the Old South. This imaginary South eventually be- comes more real than the real one. As the grandfather, Lucius Priest, in The Reivers says about the family legend: ". . . legend to some people maybe. For us it was histori- cal fact."12 What is interesting to note with regard to my present investigations is that the creation of the imaginary South coincides here with the creation of Yoknapataw- pha County, an imaginary piece of the South itself, which only goes to show that Faulkner himself, while engaged in a summoning of his historical heritage, is also caught in the act of creating a fictitious version of that heritage. 9 Matthews 79. 10 André Bleikasten, "Fathers in Faulkner," The Fictional Father: Lacanian Readings of the Text (Amherst: U of Massachusetts P, 1981) 115-46; 123. 11 Bleikasten 122. 12 William Faulkner, The Reivers (New York: Signet, 1969) 73.

If we want to stick to the Derridean terminology as it is specified in his Specters of Marx, we have to distinguish between "spirit" (Geist) and "ghost" or "specter" (Gespenst). And what is the difference? "It is a difference .... What is the difference? All or nothing."13 "The ghost is the phenomenon of the spirit,"14 it is the "apparition of the inapparent." "The specter, as its name indicates, is the frequency of a certain visibility. But the visibility of the invisible."15 The "imaginary South," the non-existent as factual reality which only exists as irreality, becomes the spirit (Geist), and the bodies in which it "incorporates" are ghosts (Gespenster) of the ancestors. The "invisible" is the imaginary South, the "visibility of the invisible" is the ghost of the ancestor. With this distinction we have reached the point when a question, which could have been posed earlier, can be asked: is it the "game of the ghost" or the "ghost of the game"? The game which is left behind by the ghost seems to belong to the ghost, but what one should not forget is "the fact that games have their own proper spirit."16 Indeed, "games themselves differ from one another by their spirit."17 The game of the ghost is only a ghost of the spirit of the game. The creation of an "imaginary history" is further promoted by the problematic na- ture of the knowability of the past.18 In Faulkner's novels, there seems to be a need to transcend history as a fact, as a series of indecipherable signs, and see it in the conti- nuity of time as human experience. "Without an esthetic sense . . . there could be no history"19 since the surviving signs of the past need to be formed into a meaningful narrative. This is why the two Harvard students in Absalom, Absalom/ fall back on what Montauzon calls "unverifiable knowledge and freedom of imagination."20 Al- though the critic might be tempted to think of such an easily manageable distinction, in Faulkner's art the opposition between history as a record of facts and a history, at least partly fictional, as it is recreated through the imagination (myth), is not simply the opposition between an "oppressive" written and an "alternative" oral history. In the creation of the alternative history, oral tradition undoubtedly plays an important role, but the distinction is undermined because this alternative history also finds its written texts and is very much dependent on them, even if these texts appear to be marginal documents for historiography. One only has to think of the inscriptions in the family Bible in Sartoris, or of the ledgers in Go Down, Moses, or of the Sutpen tombstones and Charles' letter "without salutation or signature" in Absalom, Absa- lom!, or of Cecilia Farmer's story in A Requiem for a Nun.

"The past is not dead. It's not even past" (RN 92) because it is constantly being (re)created by the present. Indeed, the most far- fetched instance of writing the past (through reading it) is to be found in Absalom, Absalom/, where Quentin and Shreve transcend the methods of a "palimpsest-histori- ography," and we read the notes of the hypothetical New Orleans lawyer. Thus, "the history of the ghost remains a history of phantomization and the latter will indeed be a history of truth, a history of the becoming-true of a fable, unless it is the reverse, a fabulation of truth, in any case a history of ghosts."22 "You cannot know yet whether what you see is what you are looking at or what you are believing" (AA 314). That through the self-definition of the present the history of the past might be turned into a "fable," a fictional process, is very well exemplified not only by Faulk- ner's works but by his life, too. In a literal sense, he also rewrote his own past through the writing of the present. He did this "first by changing the spelling of his own name (adding the 'u' to Falkner) and, later, in spelling his great-grandfather's name with a 'u' as well."23 He wrote the phantom into his own name. This "u" is what makes the difference; it is Faulkner's phantom which is haunting his name, his past, and his life. If we seem to have strayed too far from our original subject, Absalom, Absalom/, then let me quote Mr. Compson at length to do away with these doubts. The very "self-conscious" narrator of Absalom, Absalom/ here seems to talk in a double voice - at the same time about the story within the novel, the Sutpen story, and possibly about Absalom, Absalom/ as well: We have a few old mouth-to-mouth tales; we exhume from old trunks and boxes and drawers letters without salutation or signature, in which men and women who once lived and breathed are now merely initials or nicknames out of some now incomprehensible af- fection which sound to us like Sanskrit or Chocktaw; we see dimly people, the people in 21 Derrida 16. 22 Derrida 123. 23 Mortimer 127.</page><page sequence="6">630 Roland Vegsö whose living blood and seed we ourselves lay dormant and waiting, in this shadowy at- tenuation of time possessing now heroic proportions, performing their acts of simple pas- sion and simple violence, impervious to time and inexplicable - Yes, Judith, Bon, Henry, Sutpen: all of them. They are there, yet something is missing; they are like a chemical for- mula exhumed along with the letters ... the writing faded, almost indecipherable, yet meaningful, familiar in shape and sense . . . you bring them together . . . but nothing hap- pens; you re-read, tedious and intent, poring, making sure that you have forgotten nothing . . . you bring them together again and again nothing happens: just the words, the symbols, the shapes themselves, shadowy inscrutable and serene (AA 100-101, my emphasis) As the text of the heritage becomes "impervious to time and inexplicable," nothing remains but the repetitious re-reading of the legacy, and these re-readings should al- ways lead the heir to the realization that the heritage is "impervious to time and inex- plicable." This inadequacy of the text is what urges an heir like Quentin to perform an imaginative act of reading/writing to fill in the gaps between the surviving symbols. What endures is the voice of the injunction: "... read me, will you ever be able to do so?" "The Inexplicable Unseen"24 Close to the end of chapter 7, an over-excited Shreve, vexed by his exclusion from the "creative reproduction" of the Sutpen story, cries out desperately: "Let me play a while now" {AA 280). This exclamation, although it seems to be only one of Shreve's similar impatient remarks, is indeed worthy of our attention because this is the point where the TEXTure of the novel is "broken," and we can start unraveling it. Even the most nonchalant first reading of this sentence already calls our attention to the game which is omnipresent in the novel on different levels. First of all, since this sentence is uttered by one character to another, we have to assume that a certain game is incor- porated into the plot of the novel in a fictionalized form. Someone is or some people are playing some sort of game in the story. However, the narration of the game is sur- rendered to the game of narration. This means that the plot of the novel is the min- utes of a game the narration of which, through the structure and the language of nar- ration, is subordinated to the game itself. And the name of the game is reading.25 24 This subheading is taken from Absalom, Absalom!. It is uttered by Miss Rosa as she de- scribes to Quentin her encounter with Clytie on Sutpen's Hundred after Bon's murder: ". . . something rather of a profoundly attentive and distracted listening to or for something which I my- self could not hear and was not intended to hear - a brooding awareness and acceptance of the in- explicable unseen ..."

Shreve's above- quoted exclamation involves his exclusion from the game. Thus, while Quentin is play- ing, Shreve cannot really play, even though the competition between the two may be established. It is because the game is played with the past and the players of this game are the heir and heritage. Indeed, Absalom, Absalom! opens with conjuring the ghost. The setting is ideal for a séance ("a dim hot airless room with the blinds all closed and fastened for forty- three summers . . ." [AA 7]), and the medium is Miss Rosa Coldfield ("in the eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years" [7] ever since her "death"). She starts "talking in that grim haggard amazed voice until . . . the long-dead object of her impo- tent yet indomitable frustration would appear ..." (7). As soon as the ghost is evoked, "the ghost mused with shadowy docility as if it were the voice which he haunted where a more fortunate one would have had a house" (8). What kind of a ghost is it that would haunt only a voice? It is unfortunate enough to escape the solid signifier, the house, but it is fortunate enough to have a more fluid one, the word. The ghost starts haunting the word as meaning does. This is how the ghost becomes the ghost of the story. It will haunt the text; it will appear, disappear, and reappear continuously. (Enter the Ghost, Exit the Ghost, Enter the Ghost, as before.) We should never forget that Sutpen is already dead. His most prominent characteristic from the first page of the novel, like John Sartoris', is that he is dead. We only encounter Sutpen between quotation marks; there is a lot of talking about him, but we never really hear him speak directly. This is how - if Montauzon is right in saying that the novel ultimately defeats all attempts at interpretation - Sutpen 's story becomes "the inexplicable un- seen," a shadow without a body, the "demon" of narration. But like Sartoris himself, and most of the "dead fathers" in Faulkner, he is more alive than the living because the heritage of story-telling outlives all the scions. The description of the invoked Sut- pen, "who dead . . . somehow a thousand times more potent and alive" (AA 280), ac- tually invokes the description of John Sartoris, the ghost: . . . the invoked ghost of the man [Sutpen] whom she could neither forgive nor revenge herself upon began to assume a quality almost of solidity, permanence. Itself circumambi- ent and enclosed by its effluvium of hell, its aura of unregeneration, it mused (mused, thought, seemed to possess sentience . . . ) (AA 13) Here, in the opening scene of chapter 1, Quentin already knows very well that what is at stake here is his own heritage. This is one of the few instances when Faulkner's use of the term seems to coincide with ours: "It was a part of his twenty years' heritage of breathing the same air and hearing his father talk about the man Sutpen; a part of the town's - Jefferson's - eighty years' heritage . . ." (11, my emphasis). That the question of heritage is further transplanted to another, more general level is indicated by three unanswered questions - among others - in the novel. (The lack of answers already foreshadows the breakdown of the dialogue.) The heritage is not only Quentin's and not only the town's; it is the South's heritage. The first question is asked at the very beginning of the novel, the second almost in the exact middle, and the third at the very end: "Is it any wonder that Heaven saw fit to let us lose [the Civil War]?" (20) Miss Rosa asks. This question is what Quentin's supposition is based upon - that one</page><page sequence="8">632 Roland Vegsö "will read it [the Sutpen story or even Absalom, Absalom!} and know at last why God let us lose the War ..." (AA 11). The second question marks Shreve's appearance at the beginning of chapter 6, the dramatic pretext, maybe, for the whole novel: "Tell about the South. What's it like there. What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do they live at all . . ." (AA 174). The last question is the closing question of the work which, in spite of Quentin's not especially convincing negative answer, remains unan- swered and leaves Absalom, Absalom/ an "open work": "Why do you hate the South?" (AA 378). When the third-person narrator in chapter 1 denies Quentin the status of a unified "entity," whose lack of self-identity is also a trait of the heritage as we have already seen ("the heritage is never one with itself"), he calls our attention to the fact that we are unavoidably what we inherit, or, as Derrida puts it: "To be . . . means . . . to in- herit."26 This is how Quentin becomes a "commonwealth": Quentin had grown up with that; the mere names were interchangeable and almost myr- iad. His childhood was full of them; his very body was an empty hall echoing with sono- rous defeated names; he was not a being, an entity, he was a commonwealth. He was a barracks filled with stubborn back-looking ghosts (AA 12) This plurality of ghosts is what calls forth the need for the heir's critical choice; this is what is behind the injunction of the heritage to "choose and decide from among what you inherit," which aims at the creation of the heir's subject through his/her creation of heritage, of a possible heritage. This plurality manifests itself in the plurality of voices, the number of narrators speaking in the novel. The heritage, like Absalom, Ab- salom! itself, is "speaking at the same time several times - and in several voices." This is why the need for the critical choice is there not only for Quentin, a reader of a heri- tage, but for the reader as well, the actual reader of Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!: Then hearing would reconcile and he would seem to listen to two separate Quentins now - the Quentin Compson preparing for Harvard in the South, the deep South dead since 1865 and peopled with garrulous outraged baffled ghosts, listening, having to listen, to one of the ghosts which had refused to lie still even longer than most had, telling him about old ghost-times; and the Quentin Compson who was still too young to deserve yet to be a ghost, but nevertheless having to be one for all that, since he was born and bred in the deep South the same as she was - the two separate Quentins now talking to one another in the long silence of notpeople, in notlanguage, like this: It seems that this demon - his name was Sutpen - (Colonel Sutpen) - Colonel Sutpen. Who came out of nowhere and without warning upon the land with a band of strange niggers and built a plantation - (Tore violently a plantation, Miss Rosa Coldfleld says) - tore violently. And married her sister Ellen and begot a son and a daughter which - (Without gentleness begot, Miss Rosa Coldfield says) - without gentleness. Which should have been the jewels of his pride and the shield and comfort of his old age, only - (Only they destroyed him or something or he de- stroyed them or something. And died) - and died. Without regret, Miss Rosa Coldfleld says - (Save by her) Yes, save by her. (And by Quentin Compson) Yes. And by Quentin Compson.

The South 26 Derrida 54.</page><page sequence="9">"Let me play a while now" 633 "died" in 1865, and ever since, even though it ceased to exist, it refused to cease to ex- ist as a ghost. The Quentin listening to Miss Rosa, herself a strange living ghost, can- not avoid the task the heritage poses. What follows, the italicized part, is what I earlier called "the story of the past," and it is actually the summary of the whole story of Absalom, Absalom/, which also sets the tone of mourning that characterizes the whole novel. It took Faulkner only three pages to tell the whole story - once. But once is not enough, and this is where repeti- tion begins to fulfill its important function: "A question of repetition: a specter is al- ways revenant. One cannot control its comings and goings because it begins by coming back."21 And it continues to come back as well. As Quentin also recognizes it: "Maybe nothing ever happens once and is finished. Maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on water after the pebble sinks . . ." (AA 261). Quentin feels that repetition is inescapable; it is inherent in the heritage, and thus, it is the rhythm of existence. This is why, in The Sound and the Fury, the saddest word for him is "again" as opposed to his father for whom it is "was." Any encounter with the past (the "was") also becomes some sort of repetition of it. And since, according to Derrida, the readability of the legacy is not given as it constantly calls for and defies interpretation (which, according to Montauzon, Absalom, Absalom/ itself does) nothing remains but the repetition of reading (the heritage or Absalom, Absalom/). This is how repetition also becomes a basic organizing principle of the structure of the whole text, the novel, as well. Quentin knows that the voice of heritage is the voice of being, which is talking to him at "the same time several times - and in several voices." This is what resonates in his hauntingly repetitious remarks about repetition, when it seems he could be speaking on behalf of the reader of Absalom, Absalom/: I am going to have to hear it all over again I am already hearing it all over again I am lis- tening to it all over again I shall have to never listen to anything else but this again forever so apparently not only a man never outlives his father but not even his friends and ac- quaintances do. {AA 277) As a matter of fact, it is the secret of the heritage that outlives them all because the heritage is "impervious to time and inexplicable." Besides the ghost and the story of the past, the topic of the curse is also introduced in the first chapter of the novel. "Yes, fatality and curse on the South and on our fam- ily . . ." {AA 21), Miss Rosa says, and as we have seen in the previous section, the ex- ploration of region and the exploration of family are intermingled and become "the exploration of self."28 The curse on the region and on the family can only exist as it is "interpreted" by the heir of this curse. A curse is always unavoidable, and it contains life and death at the same time as it is steering the curse-ridden towards a definite end. For Faulkner, this definite end is always the final recognition of the inescapability of the curse, the task it poses, and death. Hence, this is the tragic quality of the heir figures like young Bayard Sartoris or Quentin Compson (or even Hamlet, for that matter: "The time is out of joint: - О cursed spite, / That ever I was born to set it right!" [I.v]) 27 Derrida 11. 28 Minter 85.</page><page sequence="10">634 Roland Vegsö Sutpen's design, the foundation of a dynasty, is an attempt to secure the continuity of a certain kind of heritage because Sutpen himself is an heir, obeying the injunction of the heritage even when he is trying to create a new kind of heritage for his prog- eny. As a ghost, he becomes the symbol of "the beginner, the begetter, the origin, the absolute father,"29 and since he fails to establish the dynasty, he leaves behind the heritage of failure to his descendants, all the Sutpen children. This is the curse presid- ing over the fate of all Sutpens. Carl E. Rollyson claims that "Sutpen's tragedy ... is his lack of historical consciousness," a certain kind of rootlessness, "his inability to ad- just his sense of the past to the present."30 But if Sutpen's problem is rootlessness, the very roots are the sources of Quentin's plight. Quentin's tragedy is his overdose of historical consciousness. Viewed from this angle, the novel appears to be one of heri- tage from both ends. In the opening scene of the novel, where the ghost is conjured, another constantly repeated pattern is presented, namely, the dialogue. The means of conjuring is always language, which manifests itself as the dialogue between bequeather and heir. How- ever, we have to be very careful with these "dialogues," since sometimes they are in- deed "only" monologues which presuppose the presence of an audience. While Miss Rosa is talking, Quentin's reactions do not exceed the polite imbecility of a "yes" or a "no." Consider the number of dialogues in the novel: the Sutpen story is told by Sut- pen to Quentin's grandfather, who tells it to Mr. Compson, who tells it to Quentin; there is a dialogue between Miss Rosa and Quentin, between Shreve and Quentin, be- tween Charles Bon and Henry Sutpen; and we should not forget the conversation be- tween Henry Sutpen and Quentin Compson, and so on. What is common in all these dialogues is that we always have to assume a third presence. As in Miss Rosa's room, there is always a third absence-like presence, or presence-like absence. And this third participant is the ghost: "Something is placed in the center, as the Greeks said, which the partners to the dialogue both share "31 This central element in the novel is the demon, Sutpen. It is interesting to note that Quentin is one of the most silent charac- ters in the novel. From a formal point of view, the most important dialogue takes place between Quentin and Shreve. This conversation makes up the last four chapters, the second half of the novel, throughout which we find Quentin seated in a "reading position" with Mr. Compson 's letter on an open textbook in front of him. With regard to its re- lation to the first five chapters, in which almost all the important pieces of the Sutpen story are presented, "the second half of the book may be called an attempt at inter- pretation."32 This is the most spectacular effort to achieve understanding. The two boys employ a very peculiar "reading strategy": ... it did not matter to either of them which one did the talking, since it was not the talk- ing alone which did it ... but some happy marriage of speaking and hearing wherein each before the demand, the requirement, forgave condoned and forgot the faulting of the 29 Bleikasten 123. 30 Rollyson 81. 31 Gadamer 341. 32 Cleanth Brooks, "History and the Sense of the Tragic (Absalom, Absalom/) " William Faulk- ner: The Yoknapatawpha Country (New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1963) 295-324; 310.</page><page sequence="11">"Let me play a while now" 635 other - faultings both in the creating of this shade whom they discussed (rather, existed in) and in the hearing and sifting and discarding the false and conserving what seemed true, or fit the preconceived - in order to overpass to love, where there might be paradox and inconsistency but nothing fault or false. (AA 316) "Read me," says the heritage. The story of the past talks and the heir listens, but since the talking is not the univocal authority of a readable legacy, it is a "happy marriage of speaking and hearing," heritage and heir, text and reader, which achieves the crea- tion of either and both. The heir must choose. "One must' means one must filter, sift, criticize, one must sort out several different possibilities that inhabit the same injunc- tion. And inhabit it in a contradictory fashion around a secret."33 (But the contradic- tion is "nothing fault or false.") The heir, through the critical choices (s)he makes, since this is what the verb "to inherit" means, creates his past, the shade of his heri- tage, and then exists in it since his very existence demands from him to do so. "7b be . . . means . . . to inherit." At some points, the "creative reproduction" of the story simply becomes the crea- tion of the story. This is how the reading of the past becomes the creation of the past, "the two of them [Quentin and Shreve] creating between them, out of the rag-tag and bob-ends of old tales and talking, people who perhaps had never existed at all any- where, who, shadows, were shadows not of flesh and blood which had lived and died ..." (AA 303). It seems as if there is another problem we have to attend to. Another death, another ghost. It is the death of the dialogue. Stephen M. Ross, in a Bakhtin-in- spired essay, "Oratory and the Dialogical in Absalom, Absalom/" sees the whole work as the battlefield between the "dialogical" and "monological." The work, through its polyphonic complexity, always seems to be on the "dialogical" side, but the text is de- ceptive since through the heritage of Southern oratory, which provides the unified rhetorics of the whole work, it is actually essentially monologic. To be more precise, as we proceed in the work, it seems to converge more and more towards the monologi- cal but never actually reaches it. Ultimately, in the "palindrome"-like dialogue be- tween Quentin and Henry Sutpen, "the dialogue becomes a discursive object, a sym- bol for the death of dialogue . . . ."34 If the dialogue is the means of understanding something external, "the different," and the dialogue is "dead," there really seems to be no hope for anything else except for an "internal" understanding. The dialogue with the past becomes a dialogue with one's self. It is like the two Quentins talking to each other. The legacy is the language, or "notlanguage," in which this (not)dialogue takes place. Through narration (which here means the simultaneous reading and writ- ing of the past, the text of heritage) the distinctions between narrator and narrated (like the moments of identification in the novel), between past and present, break down. We are left with an inextricable dialectics which implies interdependence: both the present and the past, the heir and the heritage, the reader and the text participate in the creation of themselves and each other. *** 33 Derrida 16. 34 Stephen M.

It is similar to Mr. Compson's false fantasy about Miss Rosa's encounter with the dead Charles Bon. The story of the past seemed convincingly shadowy: "Yes, shadowy: a myth, a phantom: something which they engendered and created whole themselves; some effluvium of Sutpen blood and character, as though as a man he did not exist at all. "Yet there was the body which Miss Rosa saw " (A A 104) And the body readers cannot dismiss. It stands there as the unquestionable proof of its very existence. But does it prove anything else? The encounter offers no ease and no solution to the secret of the heritage. The story still lingers somewhere between re- ality and fiction. Because of Henry's palpable presence as a flesh-and-blood entity, the story threatens to be "true." But what is it that is true in the story? And what is only "true enough" (AA 335), or what is false? . . . there is a might-have-been which is more true than the truth, from which the dreamer, waking says not 'Did I but dream?' but rather says, indicts high heaven's very self with: 'Why did I wake since waking I shall never sleep again?' (AA 143) ". . . 'Nevermore of peace. Nevermore of peace. Nevermore Nevermore Nevermore'" {AA 373). This is how fiction becomes our reality and our reality fiction. The question is the same as that which is echoed by Faulkner's speculations since "Faulkner had [also] played with related contingencies wondering whether he had created the world of his fiction with its 'shady but ingenious shapes' or 'it had invented me.'"35 Thus, what the hermeneutics of heritage teaches us is that the heritage itself is the "heritage of hermeneutics." Storytelling is what endures. The heritage is a challenge and a task. It is the "categorical imperative" of having to understand the past, but the crea- tion of the past is always the creation of the present, which is aiming at self-definition. 35 Minter 85.</page></plain_text>
