Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007. DOI: 10.1177/1086026608321622 Is Merleau-Ponty's philosophy the best support for the goals of the environmental movement? The essays in Merleau-Ponty and Environmental Philosophy are written by environmental progressives, and most of them assume or argue that Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological philosophy and concept of nature provide a superlative basis for environmentalism. The editors, Suzanne L. Cataldi and William S. Hamrick, are themselves well-known Merleau-Ponty scholars and environmentalists. To back the merger of the French phenomenologist with concern for our surroundings, they have enlisted chapters by Martin C. Dillon, Edward S. Casey, David Abram, and a number of other leading Merleau Ponty scholars. The chapter by Dillon has been published posthumously and serves as one of the many recent commemorations of the death of the founder of the U.S. Merleau-Ponty Circle and author of one of the most authoritative books on Merleau-Ponty's philosophy. Besides the relevance of Casey's chapter on "Borders and Boundaries" to the environmental theme, it is a foretaste of a new work in progress by an author whom many regard as the leading and most innovative living phenomenologist. Abram's chapter reflects his award-winning Spell of the Sensuous, a book that systematically uses the work of Merleau-Ponty to characterize nature philosophically and provide support for his own envi ronmental activism. The chapter by Hwa Yol Jung is an invaluable overview of the relation of Merleau-Ponty's view of nature and intersubjectivity to Asian thought. Moreover, a number of the other authors invoke strains of feminism, contemporary biological theory, or anthropological phe nomena to elaborate and strengthen the relation of Merleau-Ponty to ecology. In other words, there are a variety of reasons why those interested in Merleau-Ponty and environmentalism would profit from reading the chapters that have been selected for this volume as well as the editors' helpful intro duction on Merleau-Ponty's concept of nature and the theme of the book and its chapters. The editors conceptually divide their collection into two parts: those chapters that link Merleau Ponty's philosophy with "relations within the natural world" and those that concentrate more directly on Merleau-Ponty's connection to "issues in environmental ethics." This division is a mat ter of emphasis rather than actual separation. Merleau-Ponty's ontology establishes an intrinsic rela tion or quasi identity among all sentient creatures and sensible nature. This provides an immediate ontological basis for ethical solidarity among the denizens of nature, and thus a basis for respond ing to issues in environmental ethics, one that eschews human domination or stewardship over the globe. Another way to divide the chapters, the division on the basis of which I will proceed, might be between those that accept Merleau-Ponty's ontology as a self-sufficient basis for environmental ethics and those that feel additions are required. At least on the surface, the chapters that rely on Merleau-Ponty's ontology to ground environ mental ethics have strong points in their favor. In Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty shows that all things are interrelated by way of their mutual presence to one another within the "world horizon." With respect to our own relation to the world, he says: The world is wholly inside [me] and I am wholly outside myself, [and] I understand the world because there are for me things near and far, foregrounds and horizons, and because in this way it forms a pic ture and acquires significance before me, and this finally because I am situated in it and it understands me. (Merleau-Ponty, 2002, p. 474) But he felt that he had not yet made this intertwinement of all things evident enough, and thus, in The Visible and the Invisible, he develops the idea that our bodies and the world are two aspects</page><page sequence="2">358 Organization &amp; Environment / September 2008 of a single reality, "flesh." This carnal reality "coils back upon itself," sees itself or touches itself, by dividing itself into "the flesh of the world" and the "flesh of the body," into the "sensible" and the "self-sensing" or "sentient" (Merleau-Ponty, 1968, p. 250). Merleau-Ponty adds that this dehiscence or division of the flesh into the visible as sensed, on one hand, and the visible as embodied seers or sensible sentients, on the other, is reversible or chiasmic: that which senses can be sensed by what it perceives, whether the latter is animate or inanimate; furthermore, one sense modality is the reversible side of another; the same reversibility holds for the relation between language and per ception and one body to another, that is, intercorporeity (Merleau-Ponty, 1968, p. 143). But this does not mean that inanimate things sense us in the way we sense them, or that flesh ever completely coin cides with itself or becomes a closed unity. Rather, this coincidence of the flesh of the world and the flesh of the body is always, but only, imminent: "[The reversibility of the seeing and the visible, of the touching and the touched] is a reversibility always imminent and never realized in fact" (Merleau-Ponty, 1968, p. 147). This incompleteness is a gift rather than a lack: It means that dis covering and creative activity never come to an end and are the emblem of worldly existence. As I said above, most of the authors accept Merleau-Ponty's ontology of flesh and its positive impli cations for environmentalism. I will summarize these sympathetic chapters and then discuss those that deviate from this tendency. Robert Kirkman links Merleau-Ponty's idea of flesh to our sense of vul nerability in the face of climate change and thus sees flesh as the basis of both our tendency to deny that change and to challenge it. Kenneth Liberman uses the concept to speak of "restorative" relations to the earth and his negative experience of the LA river and positive one of the Australian aboriginals' sacred rites. Patricia Locke uses flesh to explain the integration of humans and other species in the Northwest Pacific Haida Indians's carved poles and communal households. Duane Davis shows how flesh keeps us earth bound relative to Heidegger's overly transcendental account of our relation to our surroundings. Maurita Harney demonstrates that Merleau-Ponty's view of the organism is illuminated by the scientific and Charles Sanders Peirce-informed field of biosemiotics. David Abram holds that Merleau-Ponty provides a "somatic empathy," an "unfolding web of interdependent relations that ceaselessly draws the apparently disparate presences of the sensuous cosmos, ourselves included, into subtle communion with one another" (p. 163). He adds that the contemporaneous emphasis on quan titative science and cyberspace tends to attenuate this empathy—to such a degree that it might have deprived the Columbine killers of awareness of the flesh and blood reality of their actions (pp. 172 173). John White links Merleau-Ponty to Scheler and makes a point similar to Abrams, but with the emphasis on capitalism and religious imperatives as key culprits in our inability to fully enjoy this somatic empathy. Molly Jensen, Jocelyn Dunphy-Bloomfield, and Hwa Yol Jung emphasize how flesh joins both reciprocity and diversity together without reducing either one in the name of the other. In the process, they link flesh to discussion of biodiversity, political philosophy, and Asian philosophy, respectively. And Martin Dillion warns us not to fall into the anthropomorphism that he believes is excluded by Merleau-Ponty's emphasis on becoming rather than being. Although the majority of the authors accept and reinforce Merleau-Ponty's philosophy as a basis for environmentalism, several mention reservations despite their general sympathy with the phe nomenologist. For example, Ed Casey points out that Merleau-Ponty's emphasis on continuism cum-wholism tends to obscure the salience of "borders" and "edges" in favor of their opposite, "boundaries," that is, "porous band[s] or region[s] in which there are continual movements of tran sition back and forth between limits that prove to be putative or provisional only" (p. 69). Casey goes on to illustrate the importance of both sorts of demarcations by showing in three different places how both border and boundaries are always present but in different proportions or manners: Their "compatibility" in the spontaneous organization of a flight of birds (p. 77), their "compene trative presences," or "marriage" in New York's Central Park (p. 81), and their failed integration in St. Louis' Gateway Park (pp. 88-89). Carol Bigwood argues that Merleau-Ponty's emphasis on perception as a "grasping" needs to be modified in light of Luce Irigaray's and Maxine</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 359 Sheets-Johnson's ideas of "ecological being as a proprioceptive self-touching without grasping" (p. 107), and that the dehiscence of flesh, "the fecund bursting of seeds from pods, and the fullness of blooms," needs to be supplemented by the "quiet gathering holding of pregnancy" (p. 111). Finally, Sally Fischer thinks that Irigaray can helpfully modify Merleau-Ponty's consummate reciprocity—its threat of absorbing otherness into the same—through recognition of the irreducibil ity of gender: "The negative in sexual difference means an acceptance of the limits of my gender and recognition of the limits of gender and recognition of the irreducibility of the other" (p. 208). Each of these dissenting chapters challenges Merleau-Pontyians to respond to their (friendly) objections or incorporate them into the phenomenologist's philosophy and concept of nature. To these cautionary notes I would like add one other. Environmentalists, Merleau-Pontyians included, eschew the idea of anthropocentricism and human "stewardship" over nature. Yet even Merleau Ponty's notion of flesh requires the "sentient sensible" as necessary for its being (see the previous paragraph)—in a universe in which sentient creatures are actually a very small fraction of what exists. Does a true ecology, therefore, require that such creatures play a less exalted, a contingent rather than necessary, role in environmentalism? Does this mean that a mechanistic materialism, or preferably a Whiteheadian or Deleuzian neonaturalism (the latter is barely mentioned in this vol ume), rather than Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological concept of nature, might provide a more ade quate basis for environmentalism? Each of these positions has its problems as well, but this is nonetheless a question that Merleau-Pontyians and environmentalists must confront.
