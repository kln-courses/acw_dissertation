Paper. 250 pp. The first appearance of this work (Univ. of Oregon, 1957) constituted the earliest full length attempt to explain the world of Lorca's poetry in terms of the critical apparatus sup- plied by Jung, Frazer, and Cassirer: in other words, within the stipulations of archetype, myth, and the symbolic structure of reality. The current edition preserves the 1957 text in- tact, and limits itself to adding a mere handful of bibliographical items in the notes to be found on pages 14, 236, 241. Correa, who has distinguished himself with several studies of the symbolic scaffolding in Spanish literature, notably Gald6s, in this in- itial effort worked from structural criticism to the conclusion that a partially conscious mythi- cal pattern exists in Lorca's books. Unfortu- nately, one is not always certain of the logical relationship in the forward movement of this deliberation, and there are, consequently, loose ends: some insightful snippets regarding rhythm, for example, that appear to be forced into the dominant mythical interpretation. For the pur- poses of this study, Correa chose to discuss only those works of Lorca that take place in the amphitheater of nature: Poema del cante jondo, Romancero gitano, Bodas de sangre, Yerma, Llanto por Ignacio Sdnchez Mejias, and Poeta en Nueva York. This excludes obras citadinas such as Mariana Pineda, Dofia Rosa la soltera, and, because its action is confined indoors, La casa de Bernarda Alba. In Lorca's literary universe, there is no in- tellectual schism between the individual and the cosmos; no analytical mind dissects the geology of the moon, thus tacitly prohibiting its descent to earth in the form of a lascivious white woman to perform a dance of death in front of a gaping gypsy boy. This attitude of mind has been defined by anthropologists and certain phi- losophers as characteristic of the so-called primi- tive outlook on the world, what L6vy-Bruhl called "participation" and Cassirer "the con- sanguinity of all forms of life." The reader of the Romancero gitano can readily assent to the presence of such a point of view, and, as Correa points out, it was more or less consciously in- tended by Lorca, who in his letters talks about creating a new mythology for his gypsies. Within this mythical context, Correa discusses the heavily laden connotations of the moon, horse, knife, bull, and numerous other objects, and signals the part they placed in the ritual of primitive societies, relying on Frazer's The Golden Bough and similar studies. A great deal of this is accomplished in the closing section, and eventually acquires too much of the tone of a catalogue. Incorporating the insights in scattered mono- graphs such as those by Daniel Devoto and L6pez-Morillas and delving into anthropology and symbolic philosophy, Gustavo Correa pio- neered an approach of Lorca's poetry that in its time was extremely illuminating and that is still a useful anthropomorphic guide to the Andalusia of Preciosa, Antofiito el Camborio, and Soledad Montoya.
