<plain_text><page sequence="1">347 THE THEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. The controversy or conflict, as it is sometimes called, between Theology and Science, with a history extending over three or four centuries, has almost come to be regarded as one that will be always with us. And in so far as increase of knowledge inevitably involves adjustment of the new and restatement of the old, processes which again involve time, argument and effort, this assumption is probably true. But whether the estrange ment from theistic forms of Theology, which has been so general amongst teachers of Natural Science during its period of remark able growth and recognised dominance, will remain permanent as Science continues its endless work, is a question which may even now be profitably discussed, and not without hopefulness, perhaps, for those who notice with concern the widely prevalent alienation from the Christian Faith of men approaching it mainly or exclusively from the standpoint of empirical Science. For not only do the problems about which the naturalist and the theologian are at issue change somewhat from age to age, so that part of the Apologetics, scientific or theological, of one generation becomes antiquated and irrelevant in the next; but it would seem just now that to those who watch the movements and the developements of thought within the realm of Science itself, and try to discern the signs of the time, there are indica tions of the probable disappearance of the fundamental presup positions upon which the naturalistic Weltanschauung is mainly built, and of an inevitable tendency towards a spiritualistic standpoint. The object of the present essay is to endeavour to give some account of these movements or tendencies of thought. It is to be feared that their discussion will carry the reader rather into</page><page sequence="2">348 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES the province of Natural Philosophy than that of Theology ; but on that score no apology perhaps is necessary. Certainly the struggle between Naturalism and Theism has to be fought on the ground of Natural Philosophy, and not on that of Theology which Naturalism declines to recognise ; and the struggle is one in which Theology must engage if it is to commend itself to a large and increasing class of thinkers1. Apology, however, in some degree is due to readers of the Gifford Lectures recently published by Prof. Ward, for inviting their further attention here and there to points so lately and so suggestively dealt with by his master hand. But if the essay should assist in any degree to emphasize in their minds the importance of those points, or should be the means of directing more inquirers to his remarkable work, it will not have failed to accomplish a useful purpose. For since Agnosticism received its name or Naturalism entered on its present phase, no criticism of either has appeared so equally equipped for its work, so thoroughly at home on the adversary's ground, or so calculated to compel the attention and conviction of the man of Science. Any account which can be given here of the theory of know ledge and existence which has been built up on the results of Science, and which, with no very great changes, has been especially prevalent for more than half a century amongst scientific students, must be somewhat brief2. Ontologically it may be avowedly materialistic, or, as is now much more com monly the case, materialistic in all the consequences of the dogmatic premiss of the sole substantiality of matter while repudiating the premiss itself. It may cling to the Dualism of which it is begotten, or favour the particular form of Monism which the difficulties of Materialism and the influence of Agnosti 1 Cf. Balfour, Foundations of Belief pp. I, a : 'With the growth of knowledge Theology has enlarged its borders until it has included subjects about which even the most accomplished theologian of past ages did not greatly concern himself. . .. [The theologian of to-day] must be competent to deal with those scientific and philosophical questions which have a more profound and permanent bearing on Theology even than the results of critical and historical scholarship.' ' Its essential features, however, will be familiar to readers of Lewes, Tyndall, Huxley, Haeckel, H. Spencer, K. Pearson, &amp;c., as well as of their critics. I do not imply that all who entertain what are commonly called naturalistic views are necessarily pledged to all the positions here enumerated.</page><page sequence="3">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 349 cism have led it to create, or it may vacillate between the two. Before all it is mechanical and determinist ; teleology and spontaneity are rigorously excluded. Hence it will be possible for its Theology to be atheistic or in some sense pan theistic, or it may adopt the simply agnostic attitude towards the Absolute which has been made popular by Herbert Spencer. It is utterly incompatible with any form of Theism. Psycho logically it is atomistic and sensationalist; it denies the sub stantiality and activity of mind. Finally, with regard to epistemological positions, it maintains that knowledge originates solely in experience and has validity within that sphere alone; in other words it is empirical and positivist. Its objects (content) of knowledge are ' phaenomena,' but in consequence of some vagueness in the use of that term and some variety of opinion, the phaenomenalism in question is not easy to define. It is never Kantian ; but in anxiety to escape from all implications of the noiimenal it has exhibited two divergent tendencies. Of late there have been manifested signs of what might be called a nominalistic trend, but much more generally it sets its phaenomena in the place of the noiimena which it has banished, makes them entirely objective, that is to say, and so becomes implicated in a naïve form of Realism. Such is the skeleton of the philosophy which is popular with modern Science and widely known under the revived name of Naturalism. A few more words must suffice to give it body. The whole system may be fairly regarded as an immense extension or developement of the mechanical theory which arose in the seventeenth century, at the birth of modern Science and Philosophy, to explain the motions of visible bodies. From the sphere of ordinary molar Mechanics it was applied to molecules, in whose quantitative mass-and-motion relations the qualitative properties of molar bodies, with which Mechanics is not con cerned, were sought to be explained. Thus the various physical sciences were to be reduced, as Newton hoped, to branches of Mechanics. The only kind of ' action ' between things allowed by the theory is contact-action, pressure or impact, by which motion is communicated ; the only possible kind of change, change of motion. In fact these mechanical principles were assumed at the outset to be the only principles on which Nature</page><page sequence="4">350 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES could be made intelligible1. For the explanation, in accordance with them, of the phaenomena of Light, Electricity &amp;c., the postulation of the ether or ethers was made, which offered the promise of still further generalisation in undertaking to supply an explanation of matter itself and its properties. A yet further extension included the phaenomena of life and mind within the scheme. Organisms came to be regarded as mechanisms, of great complexity indeed, but to be wholly explained in due course by the laws of mass and motion ; mental processes were asserted to be dependent on, if not produced by, material pro cesses ; in no wise could it be allowed that the mental processes determined or influenced the material. Thus the progress of Science is to secure the complete banishment, as Huxley says, of spirit and spontaneity, and to reduce the universe to a vast mechanism never capable of deviating from obedience to rigid law. In such a universe there is no place for the theist's tran scendent God, and all thought of purpose, end, meaning or worth is utterly irrelevant. The ideal to which Science tends is the ability to compute at any instant, past or future, the complete 'state' of the universe, could the world-equation be given for any other moment. The world, in fact, according to Naturalism, actually is this mechanism ; or rather this mechanism of Science is actual and constitutes the universe. It is indeed only known as phaenomenal ; but then that is all there is to know. Inas much as this phaenomenal world, however, for Naturalism, is independent of thinking subjects, it is regarded in the fullest 1 One of the very earliest to state this central doctrine of the mechanical theory was Hobbes. The whole of § 9 of his Phtlosophia Prima, cap. ix, is of so great historical interest that I take leave to quote it in full. ' Hoc posito, necesse est ut mutatio aliud non fit praeter partium corporis mutati motum. Primo enim mutari nihil dicimus praeterquam quod sensibus nostris aliter apparet quam ante apparuit.

Andreae Crook, London, 1655).</page><page sequence="5">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 351 sense as real. Time only is required for the working out of details and filling up of gaps in our knowledge of this world machine. Ideally, Science has supplied us with a whole of accurate and positive knowledge, a system of Philosophy in which there is neither room nor need for Metaphysics or Theology. As a description of the general features of a vast system within which there is scope for divergences of opinion more or less important, the above statements may be inadequate, but I hope, and indeed believe, that they are not misleading. I take them to represent the creed of a large number of fellow-students of Natural Science. And personally I am not surprised at the prevalence of the views which they assert. In saying that the vast majority of men absorbed in such studies have little inclina tion and little stimulation towards anything so near akin to Metaphysics as the examination of first principles, I do not think I shall be laying against them a charge which they would be anxious to repudiate. Yet here, as it seems to me, lies precisely the chief cause of the prevalence of Naturalism, the grounds of its plausibility with students of the natural sciences. The axioms, postulates, working-hypotheses and generalisations of Science, whatever else may have to be said of them, have proved brilliantly successful in the discovery and classification of the items of physical knowledge and the application of them to practical uses. Hence arises in the minds of those best fitted to appreciate their value, but not concerned to critically examine their absolute validity from the standpoint of Epistemology, a strong presumption in favour of their equal applicability for other purposes and in other fields. But Natural Science, as we shall presently see, is to be kept quite distinct from Natural Philosophy. That a postulate or a hypothesis, such, for instance, as that of the Conservation of Energy, should be fertile in good results and unproductive of error in the discovery and calculation of phaenomena, is not necessarily a warrant that it will be of universal validity when converted into a metaphysical principle. The splendour of the results of the scientific method in the investigation of Nature, enhanced as it is by the repeated failures of a Metaphysics of Nature, has captivated the mind not of scientific teachers alone * and has tended to produce an unbounded 1 Deference to Science and corresponding distrust of Metaphysics accounts for</page><page sequence="6">352 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES confidence in whatever comes to us with the imprimatur of Physical Science. Consequently it must almost of necessity predispose those whose minds have been occupied with Physics or Biology, to the exclusion of Psychology and theoiy of know ledge, to accept a philosophy claiming to be no more than solid science, 'science systematised, unified and completed.' The last things which the naturalist has hitherto been inclined to believe his system of Nature capable of containing are unsus pected assumptions, uncriticised presuppositions, unduly extended generalisations, which form no part of Science itself1. Yet we venture to say that such things are very obvious, once pointed out, when Natural Science passes over into Natural Philosophy. Moreover they are already being confessed at the headquarters of Science itself. Thus we are brought to our main purpose : to the discussion of certain tendencies in Science and certain movements in the thought of its exponents which appear to involve consequences disastrous to the naturalistic philosophy for which perhaps the very rapidity of the advance of Science has been responsible. I. The first tendency which calls for notice is inherent in Science itself, is in fact involved in its inevitable developement towards what, since Newton's time, has been its goal. We have already said that the positivist or naturalistic philosophy is avowedly based upon and has grown out of Mechanics. It is, in fact, Mechanics supplemented by metaphysical assumptions and applied uni versally. Now a philosophy of Nature must be an account of the actual world. The Mechanics of which Naturalism is the fulfilment must therefore be a concrete science having contact with reality ; the mechanism into which it would resolve the living movements in Philosophy and Theology comparable with that described below as taking place in Natural Science. In the Critical Positivism of Prof. Riehl, for instance, we see Philosophy reduced to Science and Epistemology alone. A similar distrust of Metaphysics is implied in Balfour's Foundations of Belief. The influence of Ritschl in Germany is no doubt largely due to his promise to eliminate Metaphysics from Theology, involving the exclusion of the branches called Natural and Rational. Whether the permanent interests of Theology will not be better served by a critical examination of the first principles of Science before deferring too much to its positivist claims, time only will decide. 1 Students of Haeckel and Herbert Spencer in particular will have been struck with the possibility of this naïve unconsciousness in recognised leaders of natural istic philosophy.</page><page sequence="7">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 353 world must be actual, and not merely conceptual. If, on the other hand, the Mechanics on which Naturalism builds is not a science of the actual, the Mechanical Theory, and consequently Naturalism, is no explanation of the world ; it cannot claim to tell us what actually goes on. But the whole tendency of Mechanics, through whatever stages it may have passed, has been to show itself to be an abstract science. ' As Mechanics has advanced its true character has become apparent1,' and that character is not what the Mechanical Theory requires that it should be. Mechanics deals, like Mathematics or Ethics, with definitions and not at all with actual existences. It is, in fact, a branch of Mathematics. It culminates in resolving Matter into ' non-matter in motion ' and passes into Kinematics. It is therefore easy to see that the Mechanical Theory, as Prof. Ward expresses it, has over reached itself ; that in consequence of its tendency to become ever more kinematical it loses all that contact with reality which, in virtue of admixture of Metaphysics, it seemed to possess. Thus, instead of identifying the mechanisms with which Science deals with the actual structure of the actual world, and so justifying its claim to be simply ' Science systematized, unified and completed,' instead of revealing the universe to us as a machine of moving matter in which there is no room for spirit and spontaneity, it lands us in a Nirvana where all is motion but there is nothing to move. Such is the bitter end of self completion at which the mechanical theory arrives if unchecked in the logical attainment of its natural developement. The very progress of Science has removed the foundations of the philosophy which has been too hastily built upon it. So far then as Science is an extension of pure Mechanics, and retains the precision and quantitative exactness which its mathe matical nature affords to it, it is abstract and hypothetical and stands apart from actuality. It has only gained its pretended concreteness and contact with the real world by a parasitic con nexion with Metaphysics. Its concepts, such as force, mass, 1 Ward, Gifford Lectures. See chaps, i to ν of vol. i, and compare Stallo, Concepts of Physical Science, especially chap, x, where the abstract nature of Mechanics is also pointed out. The argument against Naturalism given above aims at reproducing in outline the central portion of the highly elaborate argument of the chapters of the Gifford Lectures to which reference has been made. VOL. I. A a</page><page sequence="8">354 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES atom, ether, have become hypostatised or objectified by use of the categories of cause and substance of which Science should know nothing. It is only in this borrowed metaphysical dress that Science is available for the anti-metaphysical mechanical theory of Nature or the equally anti-metaphysical positivist theory of knowledge. Strip it of these non-scientific accretions and the only philosophy which it could furnish would be Nihilism. Thitherward both Science and Naturalism are inevitably led by the progress of Physics, if they would retain the mechanical theory as a metaphysical principle. II. Science, however, can save itself from this extremity by avowing its abstract nature, by renouncing every claim to be philosophy, by ejecting its metaphysical accretions, by pro fessing only to describe and not to explain the course of Nature. And this step Science has already begun to take. We may first observe the movement itself, and then endeavour to estimate its consequences for Naturalism, and therefore, indirectly, for Natural and Rational Theology. It is making progress amongst continental physicists, but appears to be little regarded in English scientific circles. This fact, and the im portance of what the movement may involve, must justify my possibly erroneous assumption that it is not wholly familiar to English students of philosophical Theology, to whom it should be interesting. In 1876 the late Prof. Kirchhoff of Berlin, famous for brilliant work in several branches of physical Science, published his well known Lectures on Mathematical Physics. In the preface to this work he points out that he intends, for purely methodological reasons, to discontinue the accustomed use of the term force in the sense of cause, and to regard Mechanics simply as a descriptive science whose object is to describe the how, but not to explain the why, of motions. As the passage is likely to be regarded as an important locus classicus, it may be worth while to reproduce it in the original. ' Man pflegt die Mechanik als die Wissenschaft von den Kraften zu definiren, und die Krâfte als die Ursachen, welche Bewegungen hervorbringen oder hervorzubringen streben. Gewiss ist diese Definition bei der Entwicklung der Mechanik von dem grôssten Nutzen gewesen, und sie ist es auçh noch bei dem Erlernen dieser Wissenschaft, wenn</page><page sequence="9">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 355 sie durch Beispiele von Kràften, die der Erfahrung des gewohnlichen Lebens entnommen sind, erlàutert wird. Aber ihr haftet die Unklar heit an, von der die Begriffe der Ursache und des Strebens sich nicht befreien lassen. .. . Aus diesem Grunde stelle ich es als die Aufgabe der Mechanik hin, die in der Natur vor sich gehenden Bewegungen zu beschreiben, und zwar vollstândig und auf die einfachste Weise zu beschreiben. Ich will damit sagen, dass es sich nur darum handeln soli, anzugeben, welches die Erscheinungun sind, die stattfinden, nicht aber darum, ihre Ursachen zu ermitteln V Thus 'in half a page forces were defined away and physics made a really descriptive natural science V Similar views as to the nature of Science appear to have occurred to Prof. E. Mach, now of Vienna, before the publication of Kirchhoff's Lectures. To his work we shall presently recur. It may be mentioned meanwhile that Kirchhoff's suggestion to treat Mechanics as merely descriptive, and our present mechanical laws (Newton's) as provisional rather than universal, is not so much a new step as a return to primitive Science, to that of Copernicus3, Galilei, Descartes 4, and Newton e. Fechner6, more over, had, twenty years previously, vindicated the scientific as 1 Kirchhoff, Vorlesungen ùber Math. Physik, 1876. Vorrede. ' Boltzmann, Phil. Mag. 36, p. 40. * Copernicus, Pref. to De Revol.

Compare also Bacon, De Augntentis, bk. iii ch. 4, ' which (mathe matical demonstrations) indeed may show how to account for all these things, but not how they actually are in Nature : how to represent the apparent motions . . . and a system of machinery arbitrarily devised to produce them ; but not the real causes and truth of things' This passage is quoted in K. Pearson's Grammar of Science. s Newton, Peine. Def. viii (referring to Force), ' Mathematicus duntaxat est hie conceptus. Nam virium causas et sedes physicas jam non expendo.' Newton's Hypotheses non fingo implies the same reluctance to make his Physics explanatory rather than descriptive. Jevons (Principles of Science, 1883, p. 515), in regarding this saying as ' bearing the appearance of irony,' was apparently under a mis understanding similar to that of Leibniz, who regarded Newton as a re-introducer of occult qualities. * Fechner, Atomenlehre, 1855, pp. 107-108.

A a 2</page><page sequence="10">356 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES opposed to the metaphysical usage of the concept of force. Nevertheless, it was KirchhofiT as a physicist calling the attention of physicists to the obscurity of ' force ' as used in Mathematical Physics which soon aroused no mean portion of German scientists to realise that their science was much more imbued with Meta physics than had been suspected, and that it was advisable in the interests of Science to purge out the metaphysical element whereto were attributed the difficulties and obscurities in which they had become involved. Kirchhoff himself does not seem to have had any theoretical or metaphysical object in view in proposing his change of treat ment ; it was purely for convenience' sake, simply methodological. Not only have I failed to discover any philosophical writings by him, but I find that it is Prof. Mach's belief that he did not busy himself with erkenntniss-kritischen Erorterungen, and that 'hisview rested on a mere aperçu V Mach, however, acting, it may be, partly on a hint dropped by Dr. Tylor2, who sees in the cruder scientific conception of force a possible trace of Animism, and in any case starting independently of Kirchhoff from a similar outlook upon Physics, has developed his sug gestion into a plan for a thoroughgoing reform of the physical sciences. He aims at severing Natural Science from Natural Philosophy, handing the latter over to the metaphysicians, and making Science purely descriptive and symbolical instead of explanatory and realistic. A very short summary of his proposed reforms must suffice here ; those who may be desirous of further acquaintance with his views are referred to his most interesting books3. He teaches that physical science is nothing more than an elaborate device for economy of thought, for comprehending as many facts as possible under the shortest descriptive formulae. Forces, atoms, ethers and laws of Nature are conceptual aids 1 This is gathered from a conversation between Kirchhofif and F. Neumann. See Mach's Wdrmelehre, pp. 404-405. Compare also Paul du Bois-Reymond, Ueber die Grundlagen der Erkenntniss in den exacten IVissenscha/ten, p. 13.

See also a few papers in The Monist.</page><page sequence="11">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 357 to thought, mere Hiilfsmittel which must not be mistaken for the foundations of the real world. Force, as an efficient cause, is a fetish, an anthropomorphic survival, and the ' mechanical mythology' of scientific textbooks based upon it must go the way of the animistic and all other mythologies. The term ' force ' must henceforth be redeemed from obscurity by its being only used to denote a rate of change of momentum. These views, originating on the continent, were first made accessible to English readers, so far as I have been able to ascertain, by Prof. Karl Pearson's Grammar of Science, which appeared in 1892. They are there developed and applied with great suggestiveness and skill, but are unfortunately intermingled with Psychology of so crude a kind as to greatly detract from the philosophical value of the book1. From the vehemence of their language against the objectification of conceptual symbols, some of the leaders of this reform would seem to derive their iconoclastic zeal rather from antipathy to Metaphysics than love for Science. Nevertheless their work is equally valuable to both subjects. And furthermore, the mere separation of Natural Science from Metaphysics of Nature will serve to clear up much of the confusion of thought in con sequence of which Theology has failed to always make good its claims to those absorbed in scientific studies. But before passing on to the indirect consequences of this movement for Theology, it may be well to observe more closely what it immediately involves for Science and Philosophy. For Science it is a critical process ; a process comparable to that which part of the Book of Genesis, for instance, has under gone at the hands of critics. Its teaching is being shown to be not history but parable. Its mechanisms and laws are reduced from metaphysical entities and principles to so much conceptual apparatus for descriptive use and economy of thought. Science, therefore, waives its right to speak upon ultimate reality, to offer 1 Space does not allow of a fuller description of this interesting movement. For further light on it see, besides Mach's works already referred to, Fick's Ursacht und Wirkung·, P. du Bois-Reymond, Ueber die Grundlagen der Erkenntniss ; Ostwald, Die Ueberuiindung des wissenschaftlichen Mattrialismus ; Duhem, Mécanique chimique. Profs. Fick and du Bois-Reymond raise objection to KirchhofTs treat ment of Mechanics, but their objections are perhaps scarcely more than verbal. The other writers strongly support the new attitude.</page><page sequence="12">358 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES any explanation or interpretation of things. It becomes only a pictorial memory system instead of a key to the hieroglyphic literature of Nature. Those who would exploit the results of Science in the cause of Naturalism must now reckon with the fact that Science cannot supply a philosophy without being metaphysical, whilst in allowing itself to be metaphysical it becomes obscure as science. Naturalism has always been more in favour with biologists, who receive their Physics ready-made, than with physicists who are concerned in the making of it ; and now we find the physicists declining to produce the metaphysical Mechanics which their biological companions have found indis pensable for the naturalistic system. The first consequence, then, of the Kirchhoffian movement to Naturalism is the loss of the mechanical theory as a philosophy of Nature. The second concerns its positivist theory of know ledge. Its claim that the 'positive' knowledge of the natural sciences is the only possible knowledge other than that of Mathematics, accompanied as it generally is by the further claim that such knowledge is adequate for the tasks which were wont to be undertaken by Metaphysics and Theology, comes to nought in the light of the new teaching. For scièntific know ledge cannot be purely abstract and at the same time be knowledge of the actual world. With these two positions abandoned, as they must be if the new school of Science make its way, the obstacle which Naturalism has placed for many minds in the way of theistic arguments will be swept away. And there is every reason to believe that this will be the case ; that, once scientific investigators have found time and inclination for questions of first principles, the truth of the newer doctrines will find universal acceptance. Of course the utility for philosophical purposes of this new tendency to regard Science as descriptive instead of explanatory will depend on the meaning which is to be assigned to the terms ' describe ' and ' explain.' The latter word is used in so many different senses, some of which only differ in degree from the ordinary meaning of the former, that it is important to point out to what the verbal change really amounts. Description is primarily the reproduction of facts in words. The most direct description of the motion of a body, for instance, would consist</page><page sequence="13">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 359 in a series of statements as to the position of the body at different instants of time. The same information about such motion can also be conveyed by means of the equation to the curve which the body describes. Such an equation is a far shorter descrip tion of the motion, but is still no more than a description. Generally a description does not attempt to reproduce the whole of the facts. Rather is it abstract, from purely economical necessity, and represents the one side of the event which is of interest and importance for our present point of view. Scientific description, so often regarded as explanation, is of this abstract kind, as we have seen ; it represents things or changes from a single and specialized point of view. When the description purposefully takes note of similarities and differences between the phaenomenon in question and others, pointing out identity amidst diversity—and every description necessarily does so to some extent—it has already passed into explanation according to a common usage of that term *. Science tends, of course, to make its descriptive formulae ever wider and fewer ; each regressive step is spoken of as an explanation of the next more complex, so that explanation comes to mean very generally ' simplest possible description,' and a new phaenomenon is con sidered as explained when it has been compared and related with others more familiarly observed ; when in fact the unknown is described in terms of the known, which, by the way, is no better ' understood.' It is obvious that in these senses explana tion only differs from description in degree of simplicity and economy. But we pass to a quite different use of the term when we define explanation to mean ' reference to a cause.5 The explanation of a thing in this case says more than that it is or •what it is ; it states why it is, or rather why it must be. Such explanation is far more than ' simplest possible description ' ; it satisfies our need of causality, which no mere description, how ever perfect or simple, can ever do. It would be well if the term might be restricted to this meaning, for here we first come upon a real difference from mere description, and the distinction is broad and important. It is explanation in this sense that Science now proposes to disclaim and admits to be out of its province. And this is why the acknowledgement is of epistemo 1 As with J evons, &amp;c.</page><page sequence="14">360 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES logical importance. It consists in the elimination of the category of Cause, and involves, as has been already pointed out, renuncia tion on the part of Science of all claim to the title of Natural Philosophy, of all power to bar the way of Natural Theology. It is the deliberate falling back upon the more modest character of a highly elaborated and ingeniously articulated system of shorthand or pictorial natural history. Science thus reformed by extrication from metaphysical entanglements, and still more when purged of presuppositions and theoretical inconsistencies to which allusion has yet to be made, can no longer be held to supply a solid basis of accurate positive knowledge for the superstructure of naturalistic generali sation. When this shall have been realised it may be sanguinely expected that Naturalism will have lost much of its charm and plausibility for students of Natural Science. The question will then arise afresh for them, ' Is any Metaphysics necessary or possible ? ' Science being no longer a substitute for Metaphysics, two alternatives will remain. Either there can be a return towards Ontology and Theology, so far at least as to give them that consideration on their own merits which has often been grudged them since Mill's Logic came to be considered sufficient philosophical furniture for the scientific mind ; or there may be an attempt to remain content with what, in the present state of the Epistemology of Science, are often regarded as the bare ' certainties of experience,' with the nominalistic Empiricism which is all that is left when the old philosophy of ' phaenomena per-se' has passed through the sieve of the newer Science. But it can hardly be expected that many will rest satisfied with a conceptual résumé of observed sequences and coexistences of phaenomena such as can assign them no meaning and interpre tation. Man will irresistibly aspire to be more than a cataloguer of meaningless ' groups of sense-impressions ' by means of a purely quantitative system which ignores the larger part of the content of the sense-impressions themselves. He will strive after a philosophy, though it may never be granted to him to attain to a complete one. The enthusiastic representative of ' deanthropo morphised' Science who would restrict all thought within its ideal formulae, even should he see the pile of its systematised phaenomena complete, will still find no purpose for their pur</page><page sequence="15">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 361 posefulness, no reason for their rationality. He who would endeavour to understand them, he who would strive for a solu tion of the World-problem, will doubtless transgress the bounds of demonstrable knowledge ; but after all ' probability is the guide of life,' and the adoption, as a belief, of a probable interpre tation suggested by the facts themselves, when studied in their entirety, will surely seem more rational than contentment with a pure and abstract certainty, as meaningless as it is valid, about one knows not what. We may perhaps venture, then, to antici pate a revival of interest in first principles and extra-scientific problems as a result of the tendency to sever Science from Philosophy. Meanwhile other consequences will flow from this important separation. One of these is that we may soon hope to hear the last of the historic 1 conflict ' between Science and Theology. If Science is to be henceforth only a co-ordination of facts, a descrip tion of the order of their coexistence and succession, and is not at all to be concerned with the general interpretation of them by offering its working-hypotheses for metaphysical principles, it can obviously only come into contact and conflict with Theology on the ground of specific matters of fact. That it has done so in the past with no hurt, but with real gain, to Theology, is a fact of which no one needs to be reminded. That Theology has laid claim in the past to full and final knowledge on matters of which we now see that she could not possess knowledge at all, must be acknowledged. In this respect she has erred even more grievously, perhaps, than the natural sciences, and has thereby proclaimed, like them, the need of a thorough epistemological examination of her first principles, of the origin, nature and limits of her knowledge ; a ' critical regress,' which for the most part has yet to be undertaken. The word 'conflict,' then, has been applied aptly enough to some of the past relations of Theology with natural knowledge. But such conflict will soon have become impossible for the future. With regard to the origin of the world, of species, of man, the struggle is over, and we now see that its occurrence was due to the inevitably gradual advance of theological theory and its partial dependence upon the progress of Science. When the sole remaining subject for this kind of dispute, that of the Fall of Man, shall have been</page><page sequence="16">362 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES handed over as far as may be by Theology to Anthropology, as the problems just mentioned have been handed over to other special sciences, there will apparently remain no further scope for collision between Science, strictly so called, and Theology. For the force of the following words of St Augustine, not always grasped perhaps by himself1, and for centuries unrecognised, nowadays comes home to almost every one2. 'PlerumqUe enim accidit ut aliquid de terra, de caelo, de caeteris mundi huius elementis, de motu et conversione vel etiam magnitudine et intervallis siderum, de certis defectibus solis ac lunae, de circuitibus annorum et temporum, de naturis animalium, fruticum, lapidum, atque huiusmodi caeteris, etiam non Christianus ita noverit, ut certissima ratione vel experientia teneat. Turpe est autem nimis et perniciosum ac maxime cavendum, ut Christianum, de his rebus quasi secundum Chris tianas Litteras loquentem, ita delirare quilibet infidelis audiat, ut,quemad modum dicitur, toto caelo errare conspiciens, risum tenere vix possit.' The controversy between Theology and Science, in the new sense of the latter term, may be regarded, we have said, as almost a thing of the past. Doubtless there will still be found representatives of Science who, unacquainted with changes in theological thought and methods, will mistake Christianity for a ' religion of a book ' ; and possibly individual champions will from time to time attempt to defend discarded theological prepos sessions ; but the controversy is never likely to be seriously revived. The student who would henceforth seek to mediate between the two must betake himself to their common ground of Philosophy. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to point out that the process of elimination of the concepts of God, end, substance, efficient cause (force) from Science, gradually but now finally completed, does not imply that they are eliminated from Metaphysics, or from experience. They are metaphysical, not scientific, terms ; and their banishment from Science only means that Science is freeing itself from Metaphysics. That the idea of God is not necessary to Science is no argument against His existence, or against the necessity of the concept to Philosophy3. The 1 As is implied in his argument against the existence of antipodes. De Civ. Dei lib. xvi cap. 9. 3 De Genesi ad Litt., lib. i cap. xix § 39. I am indebted to Dr. Cunningham's St. A ustin for reference to this passage. 3 We are sometimes reminded of Occam's razor, Entia non sunt multiplicanda</page><page sequence="17">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 363 business of Science is the mere description, in terms of mass and motion, of the quantitative relations of things ; its premisses do not include the supernatural, and it is obviously indifferent to theistic hypotheses rather than exclusive of them. The work of Philosophy, on the other hand, is the systématisation and inter pretation of the subject-matter of the special sciences. It seeks to introduce those aspects of reality—efficiency, purpose, meaning, worth—with which Science, by reason of its abstract nature, is not concerned, and for which it does not, and cannot, find a place. But because these things are not found in experience by Science, it does not follow that they are not there. ' Reality is richer than thought,' as Lotze was fond of saying ; and after all the mechanical description of Nature is but a partial one at best. Even if adequate for descriptive purposes, which, as we shall see, it is not, it would not reduce Nature to a machine and nothing more. It is often objected to teleological arguments that the fact that the results of adaptation in organic nature can be described as teleological is no proof in itself of the existence there of purpose. It is true ; and it is equally true that from the fact that Nature so far admits of description in terms of the mechanical theory as to enable us to predict the order of her phaenomena, it does not follow that Nature is ' objectified logic ' or mere mechanism. We may now sum up the consequences of the growing recog nition of the abstract nature of Science, and its severance from Metaphysics, in so far as they concern Theology. In the first place Science is practically debarred for the future from ' conflict ' with Theology ; it will henceforth be only with Natural Philo sophy that Theology will have to deal. Secondly, the hypo thetical mechanism of Science which Naturalism objectified into the actual structure of the world, thereby excluding teleology and spirit, is reduced to a pictorial representation of one comparatively unimportant aspect of the world ; the naturalistic theory therefore falls, and along with it the chief argument against teleology. Thirdly, the positivist theory of knowledge, on the strength of which Ontology and Rational Theology are repudiated, loses its foundation. Lastly, the naturalistic claim praeter necessitatem, as if it were relevant in this connexion. To think so implies the old confusion of Science with Metaphysics.</page><page sequence="18">364 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES to have dispensed with Theism, because it is not implicated in the special sciences, is seen to be irrelevant. III. There are other currents observable in scientific literature, of which the theological apologist may take note. One cannot fail to notice a growing discontentment amongst physicists with the mechanical theory, even as a purely scientific working-hypo thesis, both from its inadequacy as a whole and the incon sistencies of its various parts. This dissatisfaction is chiefly due to the fact that scientific experts are realizing that epistemo logical questions underlie the problems of the special sciences. It is, perhaps, not too much to believe that there are signs of a metaphysical renaissance in the scientific world, towards which one looks with interest and hope. Again, the drifting away of physiologists from the dogmatic Materialism of half a century ago in the direction of Spiritualism is proceeding, and likely to proceed. A further revolutionary impetus in the same direction is likely to be derived from the developement of Psychology—I do not mean of the 'modern' or physiological kind. Should that science in the coming century achieve a progress comparable to that which any of the physical sciences has been making, it would be quite impossible to foretell what might be its effect upon current thought in a direction opposite to that which has predominated in this 1 century of Natural Science.' (1) There is not much evidence, on the surface at least, of anything approaching to a philosophical renaissance amongst living representatives of British Science, even on its biological side. I have mentioned, in the course of this paper, one or two physicists1 who have shared in the movement led by Prof. Mach; with these exceptions there seems to prevail in their circle a secure unconsciousness of the need of critical investigations. This may partly be due to the very inadequate treatment, from the one or two scientific writers who reviewed it, of a book which ought long ago to have produced grave searchings of mind far and wide among the teachers and framers of scientific theory2. In America one notices a rising interest amongst scientific 1 Profs. Κ. Pearson and Poynting (see below). The names of Prof. 0. Lodge and Mr. Muirhead might be added to the list of the ' dissatisfied.' * I allude to Stallo's Concepts of Modern Physics, a work of great learning and ability, in which grave inconsistencies in traditional physical theories are forcibly pointed out</page><page sequence="19">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 365 writers in the philosophical side of their special departments1. On the continent, however, the restlessness is very evident, and far-reaching changes are under discussion2. So much so that Prof. Boltzmann3 could write some time ago, 'An almost exaggerated criticism of the methods of scientific investigation is indeed a characteristic of the present day.' One very interesting result of this activity of thought is the discovery that the mechanical theory, which has almost from its birth been universally regarded by Science as the only possible theory by which Nature could be made intelligible, is, so to speak, of purely accidental origin, and not a matter of a priori necessity. Just as Science itself arose out of the necessities of practical life, so the mechanical theory arose from the fact that motion is the form of change, and impact the form of action which, from the nature of our constitution, we can most easily conceive ; they are the simplest phaenomena and '. . . dem Ver stândniss am nâchsten liegen,' as Kirchhoff said. That we must explain all physical events mechanically is therefore a prejudice. The laws of motion and the hypotheses of Physics were invented for particular and special problems, and it is merely arbitrary to suppose that they are likely to prove applicable to all the subject-matter of knowledge. Were it not that our senses of sight and touch happen to be the most highly developed, we should have adopted another descriptive apparatus than the mechanical4, which was demanded by the nature of our sense faculties rather than by the process of Nature. Subjective necessity was the mother of its invention ; it is an instance of man's unbounded anthropomorphism. The doctrine of Evolution 1 See, e. g., the works of Pierce and Halsted in Mathematics ; perhaps Dolbear in Physics ; Brooks, Le Conte, Osborn, &amp;c., in Biology. I am informed by Prof. Wenley, of Michigan, that a similar tendency exists in other American scientific authors with whose works I am unacquainted, e. g. Hofmann and Wilson. Some articles in The Montst would also serve for illustration. 3 Profs. E. Mach, Axel Harnack, Duhem, and Ostwald may be mentioned as representatives. 3 Philosophical Magazine, 36, p. 37. 4 Cf. Prof. Poynting's Address to the Math, and Phys. section of the Β tit. Assoc., 1899. Prof. Poynting, from whom I have received several interesting pamphlets in which he has discussed this and kindred subjects, is one of the few English physicists who are known to be in sympathy with much of the teaching of the Kirchhoff school.</page><page sequence="20">366 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES and the growth of the young science of Anthropology have led to the detection of anthropocentric prejudices in physical theory; and mental equipments taken to be inherently essential are found like other things to have had a ' flowing past,' and to be destined to dissolution in the course of a ' flowing ' future. The mechanical theory, in fact, is no longer the sole possible outlook reached once and for all ; it is no longer held absurd to speculate about its replacement by a better1. Another foundation for physical science than that based upon the laws of Newton, more free from presuppositions and inconsistencies, is in the air2. The discussion of the special failures and inconsistencies in the present state of physical (mechanical) theory would involve the introduction of technical scientific details which would here be out of place. It must suffice to state the reality of the discovery of these deficiencies3. The following confession of them by a zealously anti-metaphysical representative of Science is of perhaps more than ordinary interest to the theologian * : ' The obscurity which envelopes the principia of science is not only due to an historical evolution marked by the authority of great names, but to the fact that science, so long as it had to carry on a difficult warfare with metaphysics and dogma, like a skilful general conceived it best to hide its own deficient organisation. There can be small doubt, however, that this deficient organisation will not only in time be per ceived by the enemy, but that it has already had a very discouraging influence both on scientific recruits and on intelligent laymen.' 1 Cf. Kirchhoff, op. cit. Vorlesung, ί § I, ' Es ist von vorn herein sehr wohl denkbar, dass Zweifel darûber bestehen kOnnen, ob eine oder eine andere Be schreibung gewisser Erscheinungen die einfachere ist ; es ist auch denkbar, dass eine Beschreibung gewisser Erscheinungen, die heute unzweifelhaft die einfachste ist, die man geben kann, spâter, bei weiterer Entwickelung der Wissenschaft, durch eine noch einfachere ersetzt wird. Dass Aehnliches stattgefunden hat, dafOr bietet die Mechanik mannigfaltige Beispiele dar.' 3 For the recent attempt to replace the mechanical basis of Physics by the science of Energetics, to substitute energy as the ultimate concept of Physics in the place of mass and motion, see Ostwald, op. cit., Ward, op. cit., i ch. vi. Several physicists have advocated a return from the hypothesis of contact-action to that of action at a distance, e. g. Stallo, P. du Bois-Reymond. • For their discussion see Stallo, Ward, Ostwald, Duhem, and the further references given in their works already quoted ; also the recently published Philosophy of Atomic Theories by Prof. Hannequin of Lyon. 4 Karl Pearson, Grammar of Science, p. viii. Since this paper went to press a second edition of this work has appeared.</page><page sequence="21">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 367 Whether the confusions here referred to are merely matters of ' organisation ' must be left to individual minds to estimate ; in any case it will be well for the theologian concerned with the demolition of Naturalism to be acquainted with them, for they are of its very essence. And if the Mechanical theory, which has almost appropriated to itself the name of Science, be really what we have here represented it to be, not science at all but bad metaphysics, a collection of hypotheses and mental symbols concreted into rigid laws and actual entities ; if it be so far from the final or sole possible interpretation, or even description, of the world as to be even now, for its inconsistencies and short comings, threatened with rejection, then an obstacle greater than any which in modern times has beset the progress of Christian Theology amongst cultured men will ere long have disappeared. (2) The abandonment by scientific writers of dogmatic Materialism has not hitherto been made avowedly in the interests of Spiritualism, but has been rather due to the influence of the Agnosticism which has made any form of Metaphysics un fashionable with students of Science. Consciously or uncon sciously, compulsorily or spontaneously, however, the tendency is in the spiritualistic direction. The Materialism of forty years ago, of Moleschott, Biichner, Vogt and Czolbe, due to the rapid advance of Physiology, has now for some time been discarded in biological literature. Haeckel and his followers have aban doned it for a Monism of which we had a much more philoso phically competent representative in Romanes. This Monism is apparently a halfway house on the road to Spiritualism. Though generally agnostic in profession and materialistic in terminology and bias, it often contains lurking spiritualistic implications. Prof. Ward has lately called attention to the admissions of Prof. Huxley, and demonstrated that they lead straight and inevitably to the spiritualistic standpoint. Huxley, perhaps the ablest philosopher that modern Science has reared, is indeed an interesting type and sunjmary of the whole tendency of the biological philosophy of a vacillating and tentative period. In spite of his professed agnostic attitude towards metaphysical problems, and his vigorous defence of what may be called regulative or methodological Materialism, he seems to have been unconsciously committed to the premisses of Spiritualism.</page><page sequence="22">368 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES It is curious to notice further that the basis of such materialistic elements as remain in the Monism now popular with biologists, is the metaphysical Mechanics which physicists are beginning to repudiate. When the reformation which we have seen to be proceeding in Physics shall have begun to attract the observation of physiologists, it would seem that the retreat from Monism to Materialism will be cut off for ever. Should agnostic Monism prove to be only the temporary and unstable product of the striving between inherited materialistic bias and growing sen sibleness of materialistic fallacies, the only direction in which it will be able to lapse will be that of Spiritualism. The victory gained in Physics by dynamical over mechanical theory already makes this move more possible, and we may hope to see the long supremacy of matter over mind inverted. (3) This hope is confirmed when we reflect further that Natural Philosophy has yet to reckon with the psychological aspect of experience which, for the pursuit of its own work, it has been compelled to neglect. Perhaps the most striking and original part of Prof. Ward's important contribution to the philosophy of Science is that in which, after demolishing Naturalism as it stands, he proceeds to lay bare, with the masterly precision of an expert in Psychology, the stages by which the whole system has grown up. The errors of Naturalism are due to its uncritical acceptance of the naïve dualism of ' com mon sense,' and this dualism in turn results from the separate treatment, by Psychology and the Natural Sciences respectively, of the experience of the individual and the universal Experience which is the result of inter-subjective intercourse. But 'the world cannot be severed from the minds that perceive it, and yet remain phaenomenal ; neither can it be completely and adequately explained or described in materialistic terminology V ' The assumed primacy of the physical as against the psychical is due, first, to the fact that in his absorption and interest in the objective attitude, the naturalist has forgotten himself ; and next, to the fact that he has mistaken his abstract conceptions for presented realities2.' The naturalistic Philosophy fails, in fact, because of its severance of the objective side of experience from the subjective, its divorce of nature from mind, its pro Gifford Lectures, vol. ii p. 105. a Ibid. p. 106.</page><page sequence="23">TENDENCIES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 369 ceeding as if the half were the whole. Physicists of the school of Mach have already arrived at the discovery of the monistic nature of experience, the ' duality in unity ' of subject and object. But the shadow of the traditional Psychology of Naturalism, a crude Empiricism, still hangs over them, and the full consequences of their attempt to force back Science to the point where it parted company with Psychology are yet hidden from them. They will probably not be hidden long, however. Epistemology is becoming busy, and Psychology may be expected to soon assert more loudly its claim to assist in the erection of Natural Philosophy. The first great contribution to that work which has come from the psychological side since Lotze (I refer of course to Dr. Ward's GifforcL Lectures for 1896-98) is significant and suggestive in this respect The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries have unmistakably stamped their Philo sophy with the marks of Mathematics, Physical and Biological Science respectively. It will be at least timely that the philo sophy of the twentieth century should receive a predominantly psychological impress. That the spiritualistic trend of Natural Philosophy, of which there are already signs, would be then accentuated, one can hardly believe to admit of doubt. It will scarcely be necessary at the end of this paper, already carried to immoderate length, to indicate more fully than has here and there been hinted, the significance for Theology of the tendencies of thought with which it has endeavoured to deal. They will doubtless be sufficiently obvious. It need only be added that movements converging from several sides, and largely from within Science itself, point to an inevitable tendency of Natural Philosophy in a spiritualistic direction. It is a step certainly, but still a comparatively easy step, from Spiritualism to Theism. The movements here described have therefore a deeper significance than the removal of materialistic or natura listic views long potent as obstacles of Theology, though there would be much to be thankful for in that. They suggest and point to a reconstruction of Natural Philosophy on spiritualistic lines, such as perhaps will permanently affect its relations and attitude to Natural and Rational Theology. F. R.
