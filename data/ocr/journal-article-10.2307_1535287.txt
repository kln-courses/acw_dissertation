<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST unable to identify more than a very meagre account of the Exodus story from this source (a further difference from Van Seters), with no account of the plagues or of any legislation, covenant or theophany at Sinai. It seems to be implied that all other mate- rial (even the "E" passages) is of later origin. The result is a reconstructed narrative which is very much fuller in Genesis than in Exodus. A more detailed study of Levin's theory would need to examine whether it is as well grounded in Exodus as it seems to be in Genesis and whether the arguments he puts forward for an exilic date are really as compelling as he suggests. But this is without doubt a weighty contribution to Pentateuchal study and a refreshing change from the recent tendency to focus on Deuteronomistic contributions to the pre-Priestly Pentateuch. [G.I. DAVIES] L.M. MCDONALD, The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon. 205 pp. Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1988. The character of this book is primarily historical, but the author clearly indicates his view that the canon of Scripture is an unnecessary straightjacket for the Christian Church rather than having any continuing authority. Only the first three chapters deal with the O.T. Ch. 1 makes some reference to "canonical interpre- tation" and its problems; ch. 2 considers the meaning of the key terms "scripture" and "canon". Ch. 3 addresses the major historical issues about the canonization of the O.T. in Judaism and Christianity: McDonald emphasizes the diversity of views about the lim- its of the canon in first-century Judaism, and claims that from the beginning Jesus and the early Christians embraced a canon of Jewish scriptures which was wider than the Hebrew Bible as it is known today. In support of this claim he cites (and adapts) the list of over 150 references or allusions to the deuterocanonical/apocryphal and pseude- pigraphical literature in the N.T. collected by Kurt and Barbara Aland. It is, however, most misleading to overlook the fact that many of the so-called references or allusions are uncertain. For example, at the beginning of the list Matt. iv 4 is said to be a cita- tion from or allusion to Wisdom xvi 26: but it in fact contains an almost verbatim cita- tion of the LXX of Deut. viii 3 introduced by "It is written", whereas Wisdom xvi 26 presents an adaptation and paraphrase of the same verse from Deuteronomy. This is of no relevance at all to how the Wisdom of Solomon was regarded in the earliest Church. The next example (Matt. iv 15 ~ 1 Macc. v 15) is no better. In its reconstruc- tion of the early history of the canon the book is often very speculative and it contains a number of minor errors (for example the inclusion of three Greek biblical manuscripts among the "Lists of Old Testament Books in the Western Churches" on p. 179, where it is also not mentioned that the limited contents of Codex Sinaiticus are due to its being only preserved in part.

McKane states in the preface that these "'Reflections' have a relation to the transactions of the Honour seminar on Old Testament Theology which I conducted... in the University of St Andrews and as such they are a con- catenated description of my own Odyssey" (p. vii). Ch. 1 begins with the repetition by Moses Maimonides of "a dictum of earlier Jewish scholars to the effect that 'the Torah speaks in the language of the sons of man"' (p. 1), and with the contrast between the biblical use of anthropomorphic language about God and the philosophical preference for the via negativa when speaking of him. McKane goes on to consider the philosophical ideas of Thomas Aquinas and other thinkers, including in modern times A.M. Farrer (whose name appears as "Farrar"). The discussion goes on in ch. 2 to "the limits which Maimonides places on our knowl- edge of God and the economy which he imposes in making affirmations about God" (p. 23). It comes to a focus on the Israelite prophets whose message purports to be the words of God. "Maimonides has rejected the idea of a God who speaks", and so he seeks to account for prophecy in a way that "excludes supernaturalism" (pp. 40-1). McKane describes and discusses his attempt to solve the problem. Ch. 3 first looks at William Fulke, an Anglican of the late 17th century, who 561</page></plain_text>
