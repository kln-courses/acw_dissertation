What might it have meant to constitute the air as a perceptual object - or to simply discern the very thing that one breathes, moves in, and depends upon for life, but cannot see? The sheer impervi- ousness of air to the faculty of sight posed problems for those who might otherwise aim to subject this element to epistemological or natural histori- cal consensus: "Air is strong, though not visible," thus only "known by its effects and our apprehensions," wrote one sixteenth-century physician, who also observed "that substance, whether it be air, wind, or blast" is "to be heard or felt, though not to be seen."4 Air - that is, unlike water, earth and fire - could only be approached by indirection or metonymy. It could be gleaned through the movement of wind on leaves, waters, or skin; the liquid condensation of clouds, vapors, and fog; the sounds of moving air; the smell of air, be it foul or fair.5 Given the constitution of air through a series of indirect effects, in order to approach its history we will work "with windlasses," to quote Shakespeare's Polonius, and "[b]y indirections find directions out."6 For it was the resistance of air to direct visual perception as well as to visual instrumentation that led Bacon to assert, as late as 1622, that as far as natural philosophy was concerned, "the Nature and Power of the Air is unknown.'"'1 Within and beyond the natural sciences, moreover, to contemplate the air could lead to sustained reflections on the status affect at the limit Â© South Central Review 26.1&amp;2 (Spring&amp;Summer 2009): 153-196.</page><page sequence="2">1 54 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW point of mediated knowledge. "If I were asked," wrote John Donne in his Devotions, "what is a vapour, I could not tell, it is so insensible a thing; so near nothing, that it reduces us to nothing."8 The potential of air as a natural "thing" that was also a "nothing" to propel cognition into such an abyss could of course lead humans (and not simply hogs) toward states of being "disturbed, affrighted, and strangely affected" at the thought of it. Indeed, the notion that air "not forced but breathed, should kill," led Donne to highlight at once the intractable coordinates of his own "mel- ancholy," and the tyranny of Nature in making the body an unwitting instrument of its own demise: "I do nothing upon myself, and yet am mine own executioner" (78, 79). Whether thinking about "insensible" proper- ties of the air was painful or pleasurable, it could occasion highly charged exposures, expressions, and cognitive reformulations of that panoply of emotions ranging from petrification to giddiness (many of which we see in Robert Burton's own "Digression of the Air").9 By drawing on specific instances in the arts of engraving (Diirer's Melencolia 7), verse-drama (Shakespeare's Hamlet), and prose (from Donne's Devotions to the me- teorological writing of William Fulke), this essay will argue for a logic whereby an aesthetics of affect emerged out of, and often managed to displace concerns about, the otherwise threatening power of an element that could not be directly seen, understood, controlled, or subjected to "capture." In the cases to be examined, to reckon with the air - nature's own correlative for "that within that passes show" - exposed forms of affect precisely at the limits of vision, visual instruments, and visual representation. That "the history of air" involves the history of affect is no surprise. For air, the element long linked with blood in the humoral system, was part and parcel of a psycho-physiological economy that, as Gail Kern Paster has emphasized, was still powerfully operative in Shakespeare's England.10 Moreover, that terms involving "air" included "ghost" (an English term for "breath") and "spirit" (from the Latin spiritus\ and also that various classical theories linked the air with psyche and soul make the air's relationship to the question of inwardness perhaps all too explicit. To imply a separation between atmosphere and affect would thus be anachronistic.11 What I simply want to examine is how some seminal innovations in the representation of affect, including those two works mentioned above by Durer and Shakespeare, evince powerful traces of a "history of air" that could not be subject to epistemology nor mimetic representation, and that therefore led to extended reflections upon the "subjection" of both artist and instrument to the very air it might otherwise attempt to capture. For air could be reflected upon, but not</page><page sequence="3">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 55 directly reflected, thus posing a challenge to those artists and scientists who might otherwise aim to mobilize various instruments, technologies, and forms of mediation in order to "hold," in Hamlet's words, "a mirror up to nature."12 Air could grip the imagination and dizzy the intellect precisely because it determined conditions of life and death without being seen. Writing about the sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century status of aerial inves- tigation, Bacon himself foregrounded the cognitive vertigo that could be produced by attempts to simply subject the air to thought: "[I]n the Inquisition of General winds, men have suffered and been in darkness, so they have been troubled with a Vertigo or giddiness concerning staid and certain Winds. Of the former they say nothing, of the latter, they talk up and down at random."13 Further, he added the commonplace complaint that "[m]en talk as if the wind were some body of it self and by its own force did drive and agitate the air. And when the wind changes its place, they talk as if it did transport it self into another place. This is the vulgars opinion; yet the Philosophers themselves apply no remedy thereunto, but they likewise stammer at it."14 We might use these words to gloss Hamlet's "talk" in Act One, entering with "wild and whirling words" just after an encounter with an anthropomorphized entity, or "spirit," described "as the air, invulnerable" (1.5. 139; 1.1. 150). This is followed by Hamlet's willingness to investigate the status of a "wondrous strange" phenomenon that, as he famously observes, exceeds the coordinates of natural "philosophy" (1.5.172-75). In Shakespeare's England, it would not necessarily take a ghost or even a ghost story to make otherwise rea- soned speech seem to stammer, nor to make a "philosopher" or "scholar" such as Horatio, "tremble and look pale" in the face of inexplicable aerial phenomena (1.1 .56). "The word Ghost in English," wrote Alexander Gill, the Master of Saint Paul's School, "is as much as athem, or breath," and just like "spirit," "may meane any being elementall, as we speak of the wind, or any subtle stream that may rise from a moist body."15 This simple link between "ghost" and air (here windy or vaporous) may prompt us to reconsider the relationship between the "ghost" of Old Hamlet and various encounters in the play between characters and the air at once around and in them. For the air constituted one of the biggest problems for early modern as well as classical natural philosophy.16 But Bacon's observations and Hamlet's "wild" words also speak to a broader point about metaphysics: Any attempt to integrate the air into a philosophy is likely to raise fundamental questions about philosophy itself. Luce Irigaray addresses precisely this point in her purposely stammering and stylistically vertiginous book on air and philosophy. In</page><page sequence="4">1 56 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW The Forgetting of Air in Martin Heidegger, she posits the air as an often forgotten yet fundamental if elusive "ground" of being and intellection in post-classical philosophy.17 While focusing on the extent to which Heidegger "forgot" this detail and unwittingly privileged the element of earth as a ground of metaphysics, she argues that the air is all too easily forgotten in and through post-Enlightenment philosophy. For Irigaray, this is because to base metaphysics on the air would undermine some cher- ished ideals about the power of the visual and the autonomy of thought (99). It would also unsettle the privileged status of "things," "tools," and "techne" for the grounding of empirical science as well as metaphysics (86-88). Without air, she argues, philosophy is itself a kind of walking ghost: a form of deadened thinking grounded on the tangible dimensions of "earth" - as well as water, fire, and bounded space - rather than the "intangible, imperceptible, invisible, insensible, unintelligible" element of air out of which all thought and being proceeds (4). Here she draws from the classical philosophy of Animaxander, for whom air was not the "quintessence" (or "fifth-essence," as the aether was for Aristotle, and "dust" for Hamlet), but the essence of man - the unknown "nothing" at the source of being. In so doing, she asks, like Donne before her, what might air do to thought when it becomes the very basis of being, knowing, and negotiating one's way in the world? Can air, which long existed at the limits of perception, be a "ground" or a "basis" of anything at all? To ask the simple question, "Is the air thinkable?" (12), is to propel philosophy toward the pre- and post-Cartesian as well as the pre- and post-Heideggerian - toward the idea that "je respire done je suis." To think about air is, in The Forgetting of Air, also to confront what it means to think through it, to acknowledge a condition of interdependence be- tween mind and environment that thinking, in Irigaray's terms, likes to forget. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, air is arguably the central element of the opening act. Yet the "air, invulnerable" becomes forgotten, displaced, philosophically exiled in an increasingly stifling atmosphere in which metaphysics finds a "ground" in the visible, tangible stuff of earth and, as we shall see later, water. This leads to a final act rife with "people muddied, / Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts" (5.4.8 1-82). It also leads, conversely, to presumptions of the air as nothing. When Gertrude imagines Hamlet to "bend" his "eye on vacancy" and attempt to "hold discourse" with but "th'incorporal air," we glimpse but a moment in the play in which a substantial no-thing is diminished to "nothing," indeed "[n]othing at all" (3.4.1 17-18, 133). In the process, Shakespeare stages at once the limits of knowledge based on material, corporeal "things" and the limits of various technologies of observation through which "th' incorporal air" might be subject to epistemology and consensus.</page><page sequence="5">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 57 "What if he who gives you air," asks Irigaray in a metaphysical ques- tion central to Hamlet, "gives you air so rarefied, or compressed, or pure, or polluted . . . that he, in effect, gives you death?"(7). If such a ques- tion itself seems "rarefied," it would not have been so in Shakespeare's England. The daunting idea that humans do not simply live in but also because of the air was especially marked during periods of pestilence, in which many a mind, body, and soul were gripped by something frighten- ingly immune to detection.18 Stressing the utter dependence of humans on that invisible element in a treatise printed in 1603, for example, Thomas Thayre invoked the classical commonplace that "the aire is one of the Ele- ments wherof our bodies are composed; and without the inspiration, and respiration thereof we cannot Hue."19 Yet since the "Plague or Pestilence, is no other thing then a corrupt and venemous aire, deadly enemie vnto the vital spirits," to simply breathe in during times of pestilence could be fatal (1). In the plague-ridden atmosphere of Shakespeare's England, air thus carried a haunting metaphysics, with the plague itself based on an unknown and invisible "physics." If "some//rag" is "rotten in the state of Denmark," that something could be nothing in natural philosophical as well as moral terms, for that the phrase "roten eyr" ("rotten air") went back in England at least to 1330.20 Further, however, to recall Irigaray 's emphasis on the "deadening" of thought through fantasies of the alter- natively pure and rarefied or the polluted and deadly air, it is notable that Hamlet is positioned between these two poles in a single speech. The rarefied, "excellent canopy the air" in which man exists "like an angel" in action, "like a god" in apprehension, is also, in Hamlet's mind, as "but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours" (2.2.299-303). Where does metaphysics stand between such poles? Moreover, where does science, in the general early sense of "knowledge," stand? In a word, nowhere: The ground of understanding is unearthed through the phenomena of the ghost, through the impervious air, the "air, invulnerable." Air could not be held nor taken in the hand or "grasped" through the intellect any more than it could be caught by the eye. Nor could it be effectually subject - at least not in Hamlet - to material instruments and technologies that might aim to "mirror," "strike," or even "saw" it. As Marcellus puts it at the play's outset in regard to the attempt, sanc- tioned by Horatio, to "strike at" the ghost with instruments of war: "We do it wrong, being so majestical, / To offer it the show of violence. / For it is as the air, invulnerable, / And our vain blows malicious mock- ery" (1.1.148-51). Interestingly, the process of "cutting the ayre with swords" was long considered, according to Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), a form of exorcism, one subject to much ridicule in Protestant polemic.21 But the Ghost raises questions well beyond those</page><page sequence="6">1 58 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW of Catholic rituals and superstitions; it raises questions about how one might understand the very air that they both inhabit and are inhabited by. Certainly, all manner of technologies and material instruments avail- able in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries through which the "air" might be understood or manipulated might be mined for our ever elusive "history of the air." Fans, bellows, windmills, guns, mines, sails, powder houses, and even dietary regimens for controlling the flow of air in and out of mouths, pores, bodies, and minds, for example, were each ruminated on by Bacon in his quest to discern the properties of air.22 Furthermore, the fact that Shakespeare's London was veritably exploding with new technologies and instruments available for the manipulation of nature - including windmills, military and navigational instruments and even heating devices - has in fact been emphasized by numerous recent critics.23 For Adam Max Cohen, Shakespeare's characters often, as he cleverly puts it, "Turn Tech": imagining themselves or others in terms of mechanical objects or forms of "artificial life" (as Hamlet, of course, describes himself as a "machine").24 For Jonathan Sawday, Hamlet's "machinations" align his ingenuity with the craft of the military engineer," his language "indebted to tactical uses in sieges of the period."25 When we attend closely to the matter of air, however, we find in Hamlet a world teeming with anxiety about the limits of "machines" and "instruments" in the face of the daunting presence of the air. Indeed, lest we go charging forth - as Cervantes's Don Quixote unwit- tingly did, headlong toward aerial technologies peopling the landscape (Quixote's own sword being shattered, his body hilariously thrust into the air by the arm of a single mill) - let us simply recall the vexed status the body and its instruments as investigative media in Hamlet:26 The play al- ludes to numerous technologies through which air could be manipulated, but air proves largely resistant to instrumentalization. Famously giving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern a recorder to play on, Hamlet says, "give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most excellent music" (3.2.349-50), a demand that only leaves them to avow incompetence, star- ing blankly at the dumb or mute instrument. "Do you think I am easier to be played upon than a pipe?" asks Hamlet, "Call me what instrument you will," he says, "you cannot play upon me" (360-63). Hamlet's body may be interpellated as an "instrument," but it is one that cannot, he stresses, simply be breathed into by another in order to produce "discourse," sweet airs, nor more to the point, recordable knowledge. Yet in addition, let us contextualize this curious dramatic moment by recalling, first, that Ham- let's much ado about "recorders" - inaugurated by the question, "why do you go about to recover the wind of me" (337) - occurs moments after he</page><page sequence="7">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 59 overestimates his own capacity to have effectually recorded, recovered, represented "the ghost's word" through the play-within-the-play (280). Likewise, Hamlet's mocking request for his peers to but "[g]overn these ventages" (350) is swiftly followed by his mocking of Polonius for see- ing, along with him, various images of specific things in the air above (366-73), a moment directly juxtaposed to Hamlet's solitary attention to the earth's ungovernable "ventages" through which "churchyards yawn" and "hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world" (380-81). These moments, situated in tight dramatic succession, foreground the limits of visual and acoustical technologies through which the unknown might be subject to epistemological capture: and no less importantly, the status of an element that proved difficult to "govern" never mind "mirror," "record," or decipher. Hamlet himself might be seen to but "saw" at the air through his own playlet, for it is through theater that he attempts to verify a hypothesis about the meaning of ghost, "th'air invulnerable," a topic to which we shall shortly return. Such an emphasis on air at the limits of governance, knowledge and manipulability might well be understood as a metaphoric subset of larger problems of illegitimate governance and vexed theology that dominate Hamlet. But such an emphasis also resonates with commonplace con- cerns within classical and early modern natural philosophy about he air's ungovernability: "[M]oving air is an unconquerable thing," reads Seneca's Naturales quaestiones and "the great force of air cannot be checked, nor does any compact structure hold this wind. For it loosens any bond and carries every weight away with it and makes a space for itself, pouring through the smallest fissures. By the indomitable force of its nature air frees itself, and especially when agitated it asserts its rights for itself (2: 178-81) Bacon among others would repeat variants of this problem, emphasizing that "air" could not be properly governed until natural philosophy found a new experimental means through which to decipher it. Or to borrow Hamlet's then already commonplace conceit, Bacon emphasized that as far as the air was concerned, nature exceeded anything yet "dreamt of in our philosophy" (1.5. 174-75). Such a natu- ral history of the air arguable animates, and is newly animated by, the metatheatrical dimensions of Hamlet, where the body of the actor comes into play as a possible but flawed instrument of controlled ventilation and controlled experimentation. For the air in Hamlet is at once an eerie atmospheric haunt and an element integral to the technology of drama: "[D]o not saw the air too much with your hand," advises Hamlet to his players, "for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must</page><page sequence="8">1 60 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness" (3.2.4-8). Beyond the observation that here an intemperate and elitist prince insists on temperance in speech and action, or that here we find a key to Hamlet's "theory of performance,"27 we find something rather more curious. This moment, "do not saw the air," evinces a direct transferral of that earlier image of incompetent atmospheric engagement - a sawing at the air with blunt force in the dark and chill of midnight - to the comparatively benign space and time of theater. Marcellus's "We do it wrong, being so majestical, / To offer it the show of violence. / For it is as the air, invulnerable, /And our vain blows malicious mockery" (1.1.148-51), transferred to the theater, brings air into play as a force that might be "mocked" through the visible as well as material dimensions of "show." That elemental mixtures integral to meteorological phenomena could - as we will see in meteorological discourse and as we hear in Antony and Cleopatra - "mock our eyes with air" is important in Hamlet, as nature and art do in many ways converge.28 But the air in Hamlet is not easily "mocked," nor is it typically something to be effectually sawed at, penetrated, or cut into. Even in the military language of Claudius, the air is veritably "woundless": A "cannon" blast or "poison'd shot" of slander will only "miss our name / and hit the woundless air" - itself a rhetorical revisitation of "th' invul- nerable clouds" in King John, said to be immune to "cannons" blast.29 But if the air is largely "invulnerable" and "woundless" in Hamlet, it also produces spectacular and inexplicable effects that haunt, penetrate, and disrupt the lives of various characters in ways that scholars have not yet fully observed or accounted for. While for Hamlet, the invulnerability of the air during his encounter with the ghost is offset by the eerie ma- teriality of the ghost's description of his death, his crusted skin, indeed his subjection to the fires of purgatory, this is part of a larger problem of understanding the air in and through recourse to other elements or mate- rial things that may do "violence" to both the physics and metaphysics of the air's sovereignty. That the word used by Marcellus to describe the air, "majestical," soon emerges in Hamlet's lexicon to describe nothing less than the "canopy the air," or "majestical roof (2.2.299-303) subtly underscores a problem of a world without a legitimate "heir" nor an "air" that might give health to the body politic.30 But it likewise underscores the problem of air's sovereignty over the visible world, over that which can only "seem," for example, but a kind of liquid constellation, or foul and pestilent congregation, of vapors. For Bacon, the human eye and even the most "exquisite instruments" available for extending its power simply failed when it came to compass-</page><page sequence="9">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 6 1 ing the element of air - a concern that led to his privileging of "experi- ment" as an indirect means through which to approach the "thing itself."31 We might consider Hamlet in similar terms: not as an "experiment" nor even an "exquisite instrument" through which to test out various hypoth- eses of air circulating c. 1600, but as an extended reflection on the limits of both. When Gertrude sees "nothing at all" while Hamlet sees a spirit, we have, to state the obvious, a failure of consensus. But this problem is integral to the status of theater. At this point, Hamlet has already experi- enced the ghost of "air." This has occurred not only through an intimate ear and eye-witness encounter, but also through a repeated structure of collective witnessing (including the sentinels and a fellow scholar at the outset) - and, indeed, through an artificial or dramatic experiment designed, through an orchestrated and ideally controlled structure col- lective witnessing, to test out a hypothesis about the significance of that ghost. "I'll take the ghost's word. Did's perceive?" says-asks Hamlet in the wake of the play as a "thing" that might "trap" or "catch" what could not otherwise be directly seen. As scholars of the play well know, that experiment, the "Mousetrap," is itself compromised; designed to produce the effects it desired. Thus what comes to the fore is the fallibility not simply of the visual, but also of the experiment as a means through which to rationalize the significance of, or validate a hypothesis about, an aerial apparition. A reliable model of sensory verification is not, in Hamlet, enabled by the prosthetics of experiment or the production of "artificial life." Yet there remains a truth beyond experiment, and Shakespeare was confronting as well as dramatizing the limits of his own medium, or dramatic instrument, to subject that element of air to a form of "capture" capable of producing collective consensus. Long before and long after Hamlet, to "hold discourse" with the air - or to attempt to "hold it" through discourse, or any other instrument - required a form of investigation that could smack of sheer madness. As late as 1670, Leibniz would ask the Royal Society: "Why does not the wind carry off our heads like balloons? Such questions, ridiculous as they are, are difficult to answer. People would think us mad if they should hear of such things being investigated, yet investigated they shall be."32 Be that as it may, the air, well before Boyle, posed equally "dif- ficult questions" and, in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, made a series of particularly daunting demands. It made demands on artists who tried to represent this element, if through representations of wind or clouds.33 It made demands on "school-men" who grappled with natural phenomena alongside revived classical theories, including the atomism of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius; the miasmatic and</page><page sequence="10">1 62 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW climate theories of Hippocrates and Galen, and the natural histories of Aristotle, Seneca, and Pliny. It made demands on the "generality," as it was understood to produce devastating effects through weather, plague, disease, and environmental disasters. Perhaps - like the ghost of Old Hamlet himself calling out from the dawn of the century, "Remember me" - the air made demands that could not, in most instances, be fully met. As such, the air can be understood to have been a force of nature through which the limits of instrumentality - of the body and its tools - became a manifest problem with which to be reckoned. For the more the air "mattered" - and met with vigorous attempts in various artistic- artisanal and scientific domains to somehow approximate, capture, or reproduce it - the more of a challenge it posed to those instruments of body, eye, and mind. With this basic point that the "air invulnerable" made the body and its instruments vulnerable, let us now consider how we might put the "trouble with instruments" to use. In his analyses of the relationship between the body and its tools, the scientist and philosopher of science, Michael Polanyi, worked himself to break free of earlier traditions of intellectual and scientific history in which bodies and psyches had been separated from the tools that they held and put to use. "When we use a language, or a probe, or a tool," he wrote, "we interiorize these things and make ourselves dwell in them."34 Or elsewhere: We use instruments as an extension of our hands and they may serve also as an extension of our sense. We assimilate them to our body by pouring ourselves into them. And we must realize then also that our own body has a special place in the universe [. . .] we never attend to our body as an object in itself. Our body is always in use as the basic instrument of our intellectual and practical control over our surroundings [. . .] Every time we as- similate a tool to our body our identity undergoes some change; our person expands into new modes of being.35 Polanyi 's task of exposing the otherwise tacit or invisible life of tech- nological and discursive "use" is both generative and laudable. Yet to begin to expand on his already dynamic model of instrumentality, let us simply note that the bias in the passage above is on effectual use: on the body and its instruments effecting "intellectual and practical control over [. . .] surroundings." As we examine territories in which various instruments reached their limit point in the hands of would-be users, we might ask if the opposite may be the case, if "every time we fail to assimilate a tool to</page><page sequence="11">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 63 our body, our identity undergoes some change; our person expands into new modes of being." Instruments that don't work - or that cannot be made to work - can produce a whole panoply of thoughts and emotions that effectual forms of use can otherwise manage or render less visible: frustration, anger, irritability, disappointment, abjection, self-loathing, melancholy, or a sense of absurdity, just to mention a few. Since material "instruments" themselves, be they printed books, writing implements, or trade or scientific tools, have accrued a great deal of capital within various disciplines in the present-day humanities, a focus on something that we might call the productiveness of failed instrumentality may be in order.36 A book that approaches, in historical terms, what we might call the poetics of failed instrumentality is James Elkins 's The Poetics of Perspec- tive?1 Of the many instruments of vision long held to be pivotal for the Renaissance of visual arts, perspective long reigned as a central tool or instrument leading, for many, to the "rationalization" of space and sight.38 Elkins, however, exposed the conceptual blinders put on historians of art by Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment ideals, blinders that led to anachronistic treatments of Renaissance perspective as rational, uni- fied, and, indeed, proto-Cartesian. More centrally, he mined the many examples in the history of perspective when geometers and visual artists confronted the manifest limits of that tool, perspective, at work in their own hands, eyes, and minds. The limits of perspective as a readily usable tool, he argued, generated increasingly visible forms of subjectivity - of psyches and of artistic representations of those psyches - experienced as fragmented, partial, disoriented, disunified, or, in a word, melancholic. As Elkins newly historicized the art of perspective as an "experiment in the ruins of mathematics" (116), he also excavated how such ruins were internalized, dwelled in, felt, and expressed: "The association between perspective and melancholy strengthened in the sixteenth century as treatises increasingly turned to instruments and constructions detached from practical use" (120). To bring the issue of failed instrumentality to bear on our central topic at hand, the elusive history of the air, let us now consider Diirer's Melencolia I (Figure 1), an engraving once linked by Victor Hugo to the melancholic dimensions of Shakespeare's character, Hamlet.39 As Hugo stated regarding the alignment of the verbal with the plastic arts: "Shakespeare, wonderful plastic poet makes the grandiose pallor of [Hamlet's] soul almost visible. Like the great spectre of Albrecht Durer, Hamlet might be named "Melancholia'. Above his head, too, there flits the disemboweled bat; at his feet are science, the sphere, the compass, the</page><page sequence="12">1 64 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW Figure I .

Reproduced with Permission from Spaight- wood Galleries Inc., Upton, Massachusetts. hourglass, love; and behind him, at the horizon, a great and terrible sun which seems to make the sky but darker" (236-37). From my perspec- tive, both Melencolia /and Hamlet, as play, converge through a common concern, not simply with melancholy or science in general, but with the air itself existing at the limit point of mediation. For Durer's famous engraving is arguably about its own inability to compass the air, about its own inability to breathe. The compendious Saturn and Melancholy of Klibansky, Panofsky, and Saxl mapped out the logic of this engraving in terms both of various iconographic traditions linking measurement with "Saturn" or melan- choly and of various philosophical traditions, from the natural philosophy of Aristotle to the neo-Platonism of Ficino, through which melancholy</page><page sequence="13">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 65 was understood to be part and parcel of genius.40 What I simply want to foreground is the all-too-ubiquitous element of air in the engraving as something more than a central element in the humoral tradition of mel- ancholia (melancholia produced through bilious "vapours," climatologi- cal conditions, elemental imbalance, and so on), but also as an element that, precisely by proving resistant to instruments of apprehension and representation, inspired - or, rather, breathed its own form of life into - aesthetic innovation. The specter of geometric disarray and instrumental uselessness in Melencolia I is positioned, in large part, as a product of aerial phenom- ena beyond the grasp of both engraver and engraved. As Susan Stewart has written in another context altogether: "Wind and water press against and move us, but they cannot be grasped. By flying and floating we can have some sense of mastery over our contact with these elements, but we cannot contain them in our hands for more than a moment."41 This insight can provide a nice gloss on a particular aspect of the engraving. Beneath the images of aerial motion and flight (not only the comet, but also the violently propulsive lines of sky, doubled with those of sound coming from the conspicuously open mouth of the air-born creature), the motionless bell and the nozzle of the abandoned bellows call attention to the silence that would be sound, to the air that would be wind. The air on earth is relatively still, yet through images of motion stopped dead in its tracks - including the otherwise winged and air-born but now stationary, down castputto andthefigure of Melancholy; the motionless bell; the idle bellows; and that Platonic prototype for unimpeded motion, the sphere, all brought to a manifest halt - the limits of the engraver's medium to depict sound and motion in pictures as nature could in reality is here on full display. Additionally, the spacio-temporal flux implied by the hourglass and the setting sun is counterbalanced by the "1514," which, like the text of "Melencolia /," gestures toward the limits of "still life" as a medium stuck in time. The truncated geometrical solid, existing as if only whacked by the hammer or cut off by the saw below, reflects on the injury that a two-dimensional space might do to a three-dimensional one. This "oc- tahedron," with an illuminated triangle marking an empty space, argu- ably alludes to the original construction of air, as all of the elements in Plato's Timaeus, through a combination of triangular forms, and also of Plato's specific alignment of the air, alone among the elements, with the octahedron.42 (Here we find a visual correlative to what it might have meant, to remember Hamlet, to attempt to "saw the air" through manual or instrumental technology). Finally, the overarching rainbow indexes a</page><page sequence="14">1 66 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW natural occurrence produced in the air through a mixture of liquid drops and light that, in some respects, exceeds the instruments of the engraver. Even as shades of black and white were used in this period to signify or suggest color, and even as rainbows were made visible against the darkened sky, it is placed less as the obverse of than it is on a continuum with the upward curving banner.43 What is suggestive for my purposes is the extent to which the air forms the elemental nexus of such limit points of mediation. The air, even as invisibly and inexplicably present through the eerily empty but still imbalanced scale, proves resistant to instruments in ways that bring "melancholy" into being. Interpretations of the engraving as an illustra- tion of failed "inspiration," humoral imbalance, and the elusiveness of nature more generally to the instruments of scientific knowledge are by now familiar. But the specific limits of the medium to compass the complexity and substance of the air seems to me to inform a "dispirited" engraving that follows in the wake, as it were, of the engraver's own art, his hand, and his eye. The limits of body, eye, and implements for self-extension in the particular matter of aerial or meteorological phenomena were not, of course, new. But reflecting further on this topic can help to counterbal- ance the accrued capital attributed to concepts of "instrumentality" in its various academic fields and discursive registers - as well as the power of scientific instruments and scientific objects as vehicles of meaning-making. To simply highlight the impotence of instruments and instrumentality as it occasioned or "made visible," in always historically specific ways, arenas of subjective experience can help us to reassess our own investments in sometimes forgetting - at times strategically and at times unwittingly - the affective as well as material dimensions of the "history of air." The body's apparent uselessness as an instrument of agency or rational apprehension as well as its status as something at once used and abused by the very air through which it lived was, in the Renaissance, never more apparent than during periods of plague or seri- ous illness. Yet it is precisely for this reason that sometimes the task of the artist, the engraver, the poet, the dramatist, or the essayist would be less to "remember" than to somehow "forget" the air as a necessary and terrifying space of internal and external dwelling - and to dwell rather on the domain of feelings and imaginative resources produced at the limit of the instrumentality. The configuration of the artist-philosopher as his "own executioner" - so powerfully represented in Durer's Melencolia I as in Donne's Devo- tions - is one way to take air's power over life and death into one's own</page><page sequence="15">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 67 hands. For Donne, the combined power of technologies through which the "bullet," the "cannon," and other explosives or "scornful instruments" used to injure or kill simply paled in comparison with that stealth and "insensible" element, the air, that "disables us from seeing our danger" (77, 79, 81). Indeed, that "air that nourishes us should destroy us" led Donne to ask, in several essays in his Devotions produced just before his own death: "What will not kill a man if a vapour will?" (77). To at once express and to compensate for the disconcerting power of "so insensible a thing" to reduce him to "nothing," Donne turns to a kind of ferocity of ekphrasis: "[W]ho would not think himself miserable to be put into the hands of Nature, who does not only set him up as a mark for others to shoot at, but delights herself to blow him up like a glass, till she see him break, even with her own breath?"44 Here, with Nature's own "breath" and "hands" making the body feel as fragile as glass, the avowal of air's power could altogether evacuate fantasies of human autonomy, agency, and instrumentality. Yet since imagining the power of Nature's breath to inflate, suffocate, and destroy - and the comparative fragility of man as but blown and shattered glass - could, as Donne points out, smack of heresy (77), he quickly internalizes the logic of vaporous production, or rather tests out the possibility that he has somehow infected the air within him. On how we "kill ourselves with our own vapors," he writes: "But what have I done, either to breed or to breathe these vapors. They tell me it is my melancholy; did I infuse, did I drink in melancholy into myself? Is it my thoughtfulness; was I not made to think? [. . .] I have done nothing willfully, perversely toward it, yet must suffer in it, die by it" (78). The avowedly blurred domains of inside and outside, body and world, victim and executioner, air and liquid, and intellection and melancholy - so central to Donne's philosophical vexation at the air's power - shall resurface when we return to our discussion of Hamlet. So too will the logic of analogy, since it is to analogy that Donne turns in order to make something of that insensible substance through which he might otherwise be reduced to "nothing." As Donne works, as he puts it, to "extend this vapour, rarefy it; from so narrow a room as our natural bodies, to any politic body, to a state," it becomes evident that the substance of vapors in and around the body so resists sense and material localization that Donne can only gesture toward it through analogy, where it emerges as a form of discourse (79). Thinking toward the toxic and infected world of Hamlet, it is suggestive that he writes, "That which is fume in us is, in a state, rumour; and these vapours in us, which we consider here pestilent and infections fumes,</page><page sequence="16">1 68 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW are, in a state, infections, rumours, libels [. . .] and therefore, when these vapours, these venomous rumours, are directed against these noble parts, the whole body suffers" (79). Directing hyperbole against social agents, Donne diminishes the material force of environmental toxins: "What ill air that I could have met in the street, what channel, what shambles, what dunghill, what vault, could have hurt me so much as these homebred vapours?" (79) Significantly, Donne lists here a series of places where the plague was commonly thought to be transmitted, but renders such materialism secondary to the more toxic vapors produced by human agents through sin, as he moves swiftly from environmental analogies of "homebred vapours" to the theological origin of smoke as that which brings disease and death (81). From Genesis - where life itself is but "a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away" (80) to the smoke, clouds, incense, and fumes of the psalms, James, Leviticus, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation, where "Out of the bottomless pit arose a smoke that darkened the sun" (81) - Donne tries to reckon with the agency of air, ultimately turning to theology, pleading to God to "afford us [a] ... remedy" to expel the toxic air from body, soul, and world. "For what is sin but a vapour," he asks, "but a smoke, through such a smoke as takes away our sight, and disables us from seeing our danger, and it is just that thou punish us with vapours too" (81). Through scripture, then, with vision disabled and insight precluded through sin, a logic of occluded visuality is restored where none may otherwise be found. By turning away from the mire of invisible mate- rialism to that other invisible agent, God, and to the power of language itself, Donne counters the palpable impotence of his instruments of body, language, and mind ("If I were asked again what is a vapour, I could not tell, it is so insensible a thing; so near nothing, that it reduces us to nothing"). Through language, he turns the air into something other than itself, finding a way, in Irigaray's terms, to forget the air. Yet before the leap to, or between the leaps of, affirmation, there are spaces in which Donne mourns: mourns the limits of his intellect, the loss of control over his bodily and intellectual surround, and the limits of his own powers of insight. If, as Irigaray put it, "Not being perceived, air can serve as the base for mourning" (43), we find traces of such mourning in the power - indeed the vividly memorable power - of Donne's prose. Let us turn again to what has become one of the most memorable dramas of the English Renaissance, Hamlet. To further develop an is- sue already hinted at, we might simply ask: What makes this play so memorable? Other than that the accumulated capital through which Hamlet has become something of a touchstone of cultural memory, all</page><page sequence="17">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 69 manner of possibilities may swiftly come to mind: the combined dramas of ghost, incest, regicide, suicide, spying, melancholy, madness, or what many have seen, in however hyperbolic terms, as a turning point in the representation of modern subjectivity, to mention a few. Among these and many other keywords though which Hamlet has come to mean so much, we would most definitely not find much memorable about the "air," the "plague," or the "climate," not to mention the "weather."45 That Hamlet is thick with allusions to each of these things is, in and of itself, worth dwelling upon. But that Hamlet also manages not to be about an element that informs so much of its language, imagery, and action is the more interesting issue at hand, particularly given its initial staging at a time when the air was a powerful object of fascination and terror for the diverse inhabitants of England. Let us now consider Hamlet in terms of surrounding discourses dealing with the air, but also pay close attention to its own language, which contains traces of a now forgotten "history of air." As in Durer's Melencolia /, but now in the form of a sound and motion picture, the "matter" of air in Hamlet is so central as to be ubiq- uitous, yet also strategically subordinated to a series of reflections on the limits of the medium as an instrument through which the air might be subject to capture. Holding the Mirror: Hamlet without Air Surely nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with reason, than to resign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in dependence on the weather and the wind. - Samuel Johnson, Idler*** Hamlet has been mined, indeed gutted, in recent years for its preoc- cupation with the essence, or quintessence, of dust: dirt, land, and soil; flesh, bone, and brain; worms, viscera, and human remains - in short, matter.47 But matter was, in both play and period, in the air as well as on the ground: "there's matter in these sighs [. . .] you must translate," or "I eat the air, promise crammed."48 Whether or not, as Hippocrates suggested, air was itself a kind of food, something that might actually be eaten, air "mattered" a great deal in this period.49 Air mattered as an element packed with atoms, "motes," invisible particles knocking about and unsettling those who couldn't see, or rather observe, such matter. It mattered as a medium through which other elements - earth, water, and fire - could move or be moved, and could transmute, becoming something other than themselves. It mattered because it was a central medium of</page><page sequence="18">1 70 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW intellection and communication. And it mattered all the more during pe- riods of disease and periods in which the air became, through secondary effects, visible in ways that were, at times, no less than astonishing. Yet how to make such matter mean was no easy feat. We have glimpsed this in the case of Bacon who also, in the longstanding tradition of scien- tific literature, subjected a plethora of popular traditions through which the "air" was given meaning to manifest scrutiny: "Hogs," for example, "are so disturbed, affrighted, and strangely affected at the rising of Wind, that the Country People have a Notion, this is the only Creature that can see the Wind; and imagine it a frightful Sight." Hogs, of course, were not the only creatures who were "disturbed, affrighted, and strangely affected" at the movement of the air. A 1 563 meteorological text by William Fulke recounts various first-, second-, and third-hand accounts of historical persons who witnessed something like the wind, or a combination of liquid, air, and light productive of fog, clouds, steam, or vapors moving, as if of their own accord, in ways that could be petrifying, and would be "very fearefull to loke vpon."50 Thinking toward Hamlet, it is signifi- cant that in early meteorology, the air was understood to be particularly "thick" around the bodies of the recently dead, which emanated vapors or, as Fulke puts it, oily or "unctuous and fat matter" (12). Thus to be in proximity to the dead was to breathe them in ("Pah!" says Hamlet of even the long-buried skull of Yorick that he holds close enough to smell).51 It was also, for Fulke, to see the dead - or rather to imagine seeing them, especially in the dark of night when light flickered on airborne "unctuous and fat matter" so as to produce illusions of movement, leading "ignorant &amp; superstitious fooles" to think they see "soules tormented in the fyre of purgatorie" (12). This apparent movement of the air could "leade men out of their waye," appear to "follow men and go before them," and lead such eye-witnesses to later "tell a greate tale, how they haue been lead about by a spirite in the lykenes of fyre" (12). Such an account in this meteorological text is no more surprising than the vulgar errors peppering Bacon's prose. For the use of folklore and popular knowledge in such scientific texts could of course both entertain and elaborate on supernatural "fictions" against which developing forms of natural history could be pitched and authorized. Accordingly, such accounts could also, for avowed Protestants such as Fulke and Bacon, occasion pointed stabs at the iconophilic traditions, beliefs, and practices of Catholicism - against which a more sensible vision of religion as well as nature could emerge. Yet conventional as Fulke's text was, it is interesting as a text possibly informing, as well as encoding questions central to, Hamlet. As Fulke writes toward the close of his section on</page><page sequence="19">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 7 1 "apparitions" in the air: "[T]houghe I haue enterprysed to declare these by naturall reason, yet beleuing yl not so much as on sparrow falleth to y* grounde, without Gods prouidence, I doe also acknowledge Gods prouidence bryngeth these to passe . . . vsing these causes, as meanes and instrumentes to doe them" (46). This trajectory in Fulke - from, first, recounting and debunking phenomena such as purgatorial "spirits," then attempting to establish proper "causality" and, finally, restoring divine agency to the matter of nature - may be seen to mirror the trajectory of Hamlet We might recall Hamlet's famous "Not a wit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow," which he says, interestingly enough, toward the end of the play, precisely as he gives up his own instrumentality in effecting or carefully observing the world around him (5 .2.2 1 5-1 6). Interestingly, among many of Fulke's accounts of aerial phenomena, we find an extended treatment of a meteorological formation that was seen to fly over the Thames and hit on Stratford - the home, of course, of Shakespeare's birth and youth - and that, Fulke demonstrates, became a focus of cultural speculation, fascination, and reporting for well over a decade (10-11). I am not interested in arguing for Fulke's text as a "source text" for Hamlet, though that may well be the case (the text was printed three times by 1602). Instead, I am interested in how such meteorological debates of the period can help us to understand the ghost within Hamlet as something other than a haunt of Catholicism or a phantasmatic product of a son unable to mourn his father. Neglecting to do this would underestimate the haunt and power of the air itself as it was understood to effect lives and souls, as it was during this time made "visible" through a range of medical treatises, natural histories, and cultural fictions, and as it was likewise subject to new modes of experimentation and observation in the years leading up to the play. When Fulke's treatise on the weather observes, as many meteorological texts did, that "within the globe of the earth, be wonderful great holes, caues, or dongeons, in which the ayer" is bound yet "cannot.abide to be pined in," and escapes with "force &amp; vehemens" (18) - or when Bacon, noting the same phenomenon of the "winds prison," suggests ways to "make" the wind by "by letting forth of winds out of subterraneal places" or simulating the release of air from "imprisoned places" to examine the sound as well as force of moving ajr52 - we come intriguingly close to an Ariel released from years of imprisonment in a cloven pine in The Tempest, or a ghost of Old Ham- let emerging from a subterranean space with frightening force. When Prospero not only enacts a mastery over "Ariel" as a means to extend his powers, but also ultimately says of the theatrical medium, "These our</page><page sequence="20">1 72 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW actors, /As I foretold you, were all spirits, and /Are melted into air, into thin air," we find the limits of theatrical and scientific experimentation on an explicit continuum.53 The science of air - even or especially when exposed as a kind of fiction or product of unreliable sensory information, "such stuff as dreams are made on" - was integral to the medium of drama as an art in more ways than one. Certainly, in many of his plays Shakespeare made "visible," through aerie spirits, apparitions, ekphrastic scene-painting, and meteorologically imagined atmospheres, the element of air. Such imaginative fictions, theatrically produced, at once staged and enabled forms of collective observation into the nature and power of the air. The historical surround in which some of these fictional experiments took place is important, particularly if we consider the place of collective eye-witnessing in sixteenth-century meteorological matters. This is, in part, because, on particular days when the weather was just right, Na- ture seemed capable of producing vividly and carefully detailed motion pictures that were verified by collective consensus in ways that might strike us, in the twenty-first century, as startling. One day in London, for example, Fulke reports, vivid images of per- sons, places, and things, all in action, could be seen in the upper region of the air. Specific and vivid representations of life on earth were witnessed not by one person, not by what Bacon would call the "Country people," but by a socio-economically diverse collective who all saw the same tiling at once. "[T]he very similitude of persones knowen to the beholders," he writes, were seen "as of late, was s6en the very image of the Emperour Charles, insomuche that they whiche behelde it, put of[f] their cappes, thinking verely it had been he" (45). And so the same with "Frederick prince Elector of Saxon" (45). Such communal deference to airborne rulers might well index an overactive political imagination, but the air was a locus of representations that expanded beyond the political to the everyday, from the grand to the minute. For other accounts collectively witnessed and recorded included: sites of armies fighting, in the ayre, of Castels, Cities, and Townes, with whole countries, hauing in them hills, valies, ryuers, woodes, also beastes, men, and foules, monsters, of whiche ther are no suche kyndes on the earth, and fynally all maner of things and actions, that are on the earthe, as burialles, processions, iudgementes, combates, men, women, children, horses, crownes, [an] arme of certayne noble men, [. . .] many thynges and gesturs done by men or beastes. (45)</page><page sequence="21">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 73 As a representational medium, the sky here becomes a vivid motion picture, structurally akin to drama in representing both process as well as persons. This particular day in London, as the historian Alexander Walsham has shown, was by no means an isolated event. Different but similarly spectacular aerial phenomena were witnessed, again collec- tively, in Nuremberg (1554), Montpellier (1573), Ghent (1579), Poland (1581), Normandy (1590), Frankfurt (1600) and Croatia (1605).54 So too, as Fulke points out in 1563, "In Germany [. . .] such many things, as it were long stories, [were] seen in the ayre" (45). This brings us into a historically specific cultural climate in which "cloud gazing" could form the basis of cultural consensus. Juxtaposed to this, we might recall the moment in Hamlet in which Polonius, looking skyward, agrees that various cloud formations are shaped exactly as Hamlet says they are: Ham: Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? Pol: By th'mass and 'tis - like a camel indeed. Ham: Methinks it is like a weasel. Pol: It is backed like a weasel. Ham: Or like a whale. Pol: Very like a whale. (3.2.367-73)55 One might be a counted a fool, of course, to agree with Hamlet at this moment, but what if what one saw was an exact "similitude," as Fulke put it, "like the King that's dead" {Hamlet, 1.1.44)? And what if that similitude was witnessed, as in the opening act of Hamlet, collectively? Indeed, before jumping to either psychoanalyze Hamlet for seeing an apparition of his father in - and as - the air, or placing the Ghost ex- clusively in the domain of Catholic superstition,56 we might consider just how seriously "marvelous apparitions" were taken - and taken as historical phenomena - in the period leading up to and surrounding the production of Hamlet. In fact, the issue of collective witnessing in the matter of aerial phenomena was taken up by none other than King James. James was of course a believer in demonology. He believed in an air packed with imperceptible elements and in the power of magicians to produce - though he warned them against doing so - the very atmospheric effects cited by Fulke. Yet he evinced manifest skepticism about the power of language to determine what people saw - or thought they saw - in the natural world. In ,4 counterblaste to tobacco (1604), his short treatise on that new "vapour" or "smoke" available in England, James highlighted</page><page sequence="22">1 74 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW the extent to which, when it came to observing the upper regions of the air, groups might simply "see" what they are told they should see: For let one or two of the greatest Masters of Mathematickes in any of the two famous Vniuersities, but constantly affirme any cleare day, that they see some strange apparition in the skies: they will I warrant you be seconded by the greatest part of the Students in that profession: So loath will they be, to bee thought inferiour to their fellowes, either in depth of knowledge or sharpnesse of sight.57 "[Therefore," he continues, the "imbracing of this foolish custome, doeth but onely proceede from that affectation of noueltie, and popular errour"(Clr). This attention to the powerfully residual place of "popular error" within University settings might prompt us to recall that Hamlet was - as the 1603 title page records it - performed at those two famous Universities, Oxford and Cambridge, as well as at a range of other cultural venues.58 Alongside Hamlet, Horatio, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Polonius - who played "i'the university" - is situated within that university context in the same scene of cloud-gazing (3.2.97-98). James's account, clearly expressing skepticism about authority grounded in both language and collective witnessing, provides a nice gloss to the cloud constellations in Hamlet (the scholar being readily seconded as he shapes the world around him). It also of course suggests the extent to which the "strange apparition" was a subject of serious scholarly as well as popular concern at the turn of the century: "Thou art a scholar, speak to it," Horatio is told, being asked to explain and also literally "speak to" an apparition that won't speak back, at least not to him (1.1 .45). Like many others who aimed to naturalize celestial apparitions, Fulke drew heavily on Aristotle and Pliny to produce a range of explanations for the remarkable artistry of nature. Those collectively witnessed "ap- paritions," for example, were the product of times "when the disposition of the ayre, hath been suche, that it hath receiued the image of manye thinges placed and done on the earth" (46). This theory of celestial im- pressionability positions the air as a mimetic medium or mirror, reflecting things exactly as they are, or once were, on earth. What Fulke did not do in this instance was discredit the idea that what was seen was in fact what was there. Instead, to account for eye-witness accounts of images of monsters that don't exist on earth, he describes the natural cause of such phenomena - and invokes Horace's famous dicta in the process: "[B]ecause [air] is apte to receyue dyuerse images, as well in one place</page><page sequence="23">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 75 as in another, these monstruous formes and straunge actions, or stories proceade of the ioyninge of dyuerse formes and actions," mix and com- ingle in unpredictable ways, "as if twoo histories, were confusely paynted in one, the whole picture would be straunge or (as the Poet sayeth) if a paynter to a mans head, should set a horses neck, &amp; after dyuerse fethers" (46). At the same time, Fulke observed that through the use of catoptrics, "artificially by certein glasses, and instruments," artisans could produce the very same effects of Nature (45-46). Given this common trope of Nature as a spectacularly indecorous artist, we might recuperate Samuel Johnson's well-worn sentiment that Shakespeare was "the poet of nature"59 - only shifting away from John- son's Aristotelian ideals of unity to foreground, rather, Nature's capacity for disunity and indecorum. There is hardly a play less decorous (be it generically, linguistically, thematically, or topically) than Hamlet. This is indeed a play where multiple "histories" become "confusedly paynted in one." Yet why it is that some "histories" are, or have been, easier to see than others, remains the question at hand. By "nature" Johnson meant human nature,60 and his intolerance of the English preoccupation with the weather - elaborated on in an essay from which the above epigraph was taken - indexes a hostility to the very "nature" with which Shakespear- ean drama was so heavily enmeshed. "He that shall resolutely excite his faculties, or exert his virtues," wrote Johnson, "will soon make himself superior to the seasons, and may set at defiance the morning mist, and the evening damp, the blasts of the east, and the clouds of the south."61 This perspective suggests the extent to which Johnson, like many to follow, may have been blocked from understanding Hamlet as a drama precisely about what it may have meant to experience - to borrow Johnson's own words: the fact that "nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with reason, than to resign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in dependence on the weather and the wind." Is it that Shakespearean criticism has largely "forgotten" what we will now see as an eerily mate- rial substrate of the air in Hamlet? Or is it that something about the play was designed precisely to enable the forgetting of air, the dependence on the weather, and the wind? In turning now to the "bad air" in Hamlet, a text marked by the very constellation of vapors in Donne, I want to emphasize that one of the central symptoms of both melancholy and the plague were breathing problems caused by the quality of the air: The "worst" kind of air, wrote Robert Burton, "is a thicke, cloudy, misty, foggy Ayre, or such as come from fennes, Moorish grounds, lakes, muckhils, draughts, sinkes, where any filthy carcasses or carrion lies, or from whence any stinking fulsome</page><page sequence="24">1 76 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW smell comes . . . much Air is unwholesome, and ingenders melancholy, plagues, and what not''62 The regiment of life, printed eight times between 1544 and 1600, blames "the stynch and filthy sauours that corrupte that ayre whiche we lyue in: for we can not Hue wythout drawynge of the breath, and we haue none other breth but of the ayre rounde aboute vs."63 Of the plague, "many one is so strayte wynded, that he can not speake, and when he breatheth it is with great laboure and difficultie."64 When, in the final act of the play, Hamlet speaks of the "fatness of these pursey times" - pursive meaning "short-winded" - he not only anticipates his own condition of being "fat and scant of breath" (5.3.290), but he also articulates the breathing problems that mark the "rotten . . . state of Denmark" ( 1 .5.90). From the performance of woe through "windy suspiration of forc'd breath" (1.2.79) to Ophelia's death by drowning, this is a play marked by characters who not only have trouble breath- ing, but who try to take the air into their own hands. Hamlet imagines he might "walk out of the air" into his own "grave" (2.2.206-07) or "eat the air, promise-crammed" (3.3.93-94), and is seen to "bend [his] eye on vacancy / And with the corporal air ... hold discourse." He might choose the "breathing time of day" (5.3.171) and even infect the air, leaving the "guts" of Polonius to be "nose[d]" in the lobby (4.3.31-37). Yet, recalling the "unctuous and fat matter" in the air of the decaying dead, we might well say that Hamlet is not simply "inspired" by, but also forced to breathe, the air of his own father's ghost. Although scholars have long diagnosed Hamlet's symptoms as signs of melancholy, the play returns again and again to signs of the plague and, specifically, the breathing of toxic air. "[A] man may know the infection of the aire which threatneth vs with Pestilent sicknesses," wrote Thomas Lodge in 1603, not only by "thicke, cloudy, moyst, and ill smelling vapours, the Skie vnaccustomed to Northren windes, but sollicited with Southerly blastes;" but also by a proliferation of vermin, dead bodies, and conspicuous shifts in temperature and air quality: If ... there appeare any increase of such creatures as are en- gendred of putrifaction, as wormes of the earth, flies, gnattes, eales, serpents, toades, frogs, and such like foretokening corrup- tion and putrifaction in the earth and waters, and when the aire the same day chaungeth from f aire tofoule, and from cleare to cloudy, when the Sunne shineth and afterwards hideth his head in cloudes, in one and the same day, it is a signe that the tem- perature of the aire is altered. And when as Rats, Moules, and other creatures, (accustomed to Hue vnder ground) forsake their holes and habitations, it is a token of corruption in the same, by</page><page sequence="25">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 77 reason that such sorts of creatures forsake their wonted places of aboade. (emphasis added)65 This series of commonplaces might recall the witches of Macbeth, who "hover through fog and filthy air" and who "seemed corporal" yet swiftly vanish, "as breath into the wind" and later fill a cauldron with what Lodge and others could easily imagine as signs, symptoms, and even carriers of the plague.66 So too, the vermin Hamlet speaks of, be it the rat, mouse, worm, maggot, serpent, dead dog, or decaying body, combine with his own conspicuous shifts of temperature (5.2.95-97) and those "thicke, cloudy [. . .] and ill smelling vapours" in the "rotten" state of Denmark to resonate with signs of the plague demarcated above. Hamlet's famous allusion to the Ghost as an "old mole" (1 .5. 170) might thus be resituated in terms of Lodge's compilation of ancient and modern knowledge about plague-time - times when "moules, and other creatures, (accustomed to Hue vnder ground) foresake their holes and habitations." Throughout Hamlet, the fumes and vapors of a decayed world align melancholy with both religious and climatological forms of corruption. If, as Hamlet says, directly after the scene of cloud-gazing with Polonius,"Tis now the witching time of night, / When the churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world" (3.2.379-81), then this toxic air is embodied in the ghost, imagined as a product of the earth's breath after consuming the dead: It "hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws / To cast thee up again [. . .] so horridly to shake our disposition" ( 1 .4.2 1 2). The ghost is aligned from the first with the distinctly regional quality of the air: It is a sign, says Horatio "to the omen coming on [...]/ Unto our climatures and countrymen" (1.1.174). This issue is further emphasized in the 1603 Quarto of Hamlet, where Hamlet is allegedly sent away to get him out of the bad air in Denmark: "the aire and climate of the Country / May please him better than his natiue home."67 "The air bites shrewdly, it's very cold," says Horatio (1 .4. 1), echoing the opening words of the play that link temperature with temperament: "'Tis bitter cold and I am sick at heart" (1. 1 .8-9). Hamlet's response to Horatio, "[i]t is a nipping and an eager air," continues the anthropomorphization of what quickly becomes embodied in the ghost: "Be thou a spirit of health or a goblin damned / Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell" (1.4.40-41). If, as Johnson critically observed, "when two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather; they are in haste to tell each other, what each must already know, that it is hot or cold, bright or cloudy, windy or calm" {Idler, 367, emphasis added), such "talk" at the outset of Hamlet constitutes the basis of the eerie unknown.</page><page sequence="26">1 78 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW "This most excellent canopy the air," observes Hamlet, "why it ap- peareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours" (2.2.299-303). However poignantly such words configure melancholic perception, let us observe how the same conceit emerges in Dekker's The deade tearme, where the breath of a ghost, as an embodiment of plague, hangs in the London air: she doth now walks still in a ghostly and formidable shape vppe and downe my streets. Shee (with her /// Company) infecteth my Sonnes and Daughters, and leades them dayly into such daungers, that (in hundreds at a time) doe they loose theyr Hues. Fiue yeeres hath shee beene a troublesome Guest vnto me [. . .] Deadvnto vs [. . J are our liueliest dayes, whitest this pestilent vapour hanges ouer our heades.6* The ghost of Old Hamlet, so familiar to us now as a haunt of purgatory, a sign of melancholy, or an illusion of the devil himself, seems a striking embodiment of environmental blastments and the coming of plague. For Hamlet is not only blasted with the air of that questionable shape, but he also ultimately lurks in places of the dead where bad air, melancholy, and the plague were thought to be "engendered": He lugs the guts of Polonius, holds human remains in the graveyard close enough to smell ("Pah!"), and wishes to be buried alive alongside the corpse of Ophelia. As such, we might think more literally about Walter Benjamin's sense that "Hamlet wants to breathe in the suffocating air of his fate in one deep breath."69 If Claudius likens illness to a "foul disease" that feeds "on the pith of life" (4.1.21-22), then it is suggestive that Hamlet's symptoms after seeing the ghost mimic both the melancholic as well as the plague victim. The "mortall signes in such as are diseased," wrote Lodge: "are fSeblenes and weaknes [ . . .] of the body (which may be discouered by the pulse when it is weake, vnequall, disorderly, lanquishing and intermittent, by often Sincopes or soundings, alienation, and frenzie [. . .] cold in the ex- treame partes, and intolerable heate in the inward, vnquenchable thirst [. . .] Colde swet about the forehead and face [. . .] weaknesse of the heart, shortnes of breath, and great stench of the same, lacke of steepe, and appetite to eate, profound sleepe, chaunging of colour in the face, exchaunged to palenesse" and "cogitation or great vnquietnes. All these signes betoken either certaine death or daunger thereof in the Plague" (C3r). When Hamlet says, "Hold, hold, my heart /And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, / But bear me stiffly up" (1 .5.93-95), and he is soon, ac-</page><page sequence="27">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 79 cording to Ophelia, "[p]ale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other [. . .] his head thus waving up and down," and raising "a sigh so piteous and so profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being" (2.1.81-96), we have an image and prefiguration of Hamlet breathing his last breath. The sigh itself is even transposed to a final inhalation that could "shatter all his bulk and end his being." That sighs proliferate in this play is apt, given that sighs were theorized in medical texts as a symptom of a body that has, quite literally, forgotten to breathe and is compensating, to quote Hamlet, by "draw[ing] thy breath in pain" (5.2.353). The trope of sighing as self-forgetting while thinking so intently on another is so common in the period as to be theatricalized as "windy suspiration[s] of forced breath" and, as later put by Gertrude, "if words be made of breath / And breath of life, I have no life to breathe / What thou has said to me" (3.4.199-201). But this sigh or deprivation of air that might "end ones being" is fatally imagined, not only in Hamlet - in some sense literally walking "out of the air" and into his "grave" - but also in Ophelia's drowning. The fleeting fantasy that one might live without air and, thus, in the water - as Ophelia is, for a moment, "like a creature native and indued / Unto that element" (4.8.178-79) - is counterpoised with the fear that to walk in the air, to "eat the air," to breathe in this play, where "rank corruption, mining all within / Infects unseen" (3.4. 1 50-5 1 ) is to be vulnerable to what Laertes calls "contagious blastments [. . .] most imminent" (1.3.42). And this is a language of the plague that is farther echoed as Hamlet gives Ophelia "this plague for thy dowry" (3.1.1 36-37). The image of fatal blastments becomes overblown in the play: Hamlet himself is "blasted with ecstasy" (2.2. 1 62), "mad as the sea and wind when both contend" (4. 1 .7); Claudius is "like a mildew's ear / Blasting his wholesome brother" (3.4.64-65); and even Priam killed "with the whiff and wind" of a fell sword (2.2.469). Imagining the "enginer / Hoist with his own petard" (which Harold Jen- kins glosses as "Blown into the air by his own bomb"), Hamlet imagines he will "blow [his enemies] at the moon" (3.4.208-11). If, as Jonathan Sawday notes, Hamlet here draws on the language of military engineering, such an image of a son hoping to instrumentalize "the air, invulnerable" is soon undercut by a prince both "fat and scant of breath," who can no longer even sigh before having his story told without the help of another: "If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart /[...] breathe thy breath in pain / To tell my story" (5.2.290; 353-54). Air, then, as the mythic and Galenic medium of thought, intellect, com- munication, is, like the vapors of Donne's world, "infected" in Hamlet. It is also, we might note, rather wet. We might transfer Donne's words to</page><page sequence="28">1 80 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW Hamlet: "But what have I done, either to breed or to breathe these vapours. They tell me it is my melancholy; did I infuse, did I drink in melancholy into myself? Is it my thoughtfulness; was I not made to think?" The uneasy mingling of air and water (the conflation here of breathing and drinking) that constitutes being and thinking is in fact central to Hamlet. In perhaps all-too-literal terms, given the dominant trope of alcoholic "spirits" in the play, it is at least minimally suggestive that Lodge stressed that drinking "wine" in times of pestilence would only hasten fatality, making the body "more capable to receiue the euill influence of the ayre" (E3r). Further, the relation of liquids to air is writ both large and small in Hamlet. In small, indeed very small, recall the toxic wine - designed to "drink to Hamlet's better breath" (5.2.268)- that Gertrude imbibes only to swiftly expire; the liquid "unction" or "contagion" on the tip of a sword that "quite o'er crows my spririt," says Hamlet, as if he has become his own father's ghost (4.7.140, 156; 5.2.358); and the famous staccato of "O, o, o, o" in the Folio of Hamlet, which stresses the toxic effect of even a small drop of liquid as the end of breathing. In more general terms, the plague itself was classically understood as originating in an "earth ouerflowed with too much moysture and filled with grosse and euill vapours, which by vertue of the Sunne bÂ£eing lifted vppe into the ayre, and mixed with the same, corrupteth the nature and complexion thereof so that they who drink or "sucke this infected aire are in daunger to be attainted with this contagion and sicknesse of the Pestilence" (Lodge, B4rv, emphasis added). Since "Water" as Bacon put it, is "contiguous with Aire, " and since "vapours " moistened the atmosphere, to breathe infected air during plague-time constituted a form of involuntary and fatal drinking.10 This simple point may gloss Donne's conflation of breathing and drinking, but it may also compel us to take what has long been understood as the gravedigger's burlesque of legal argumentation in Hamlet at least a bit more seriously: "If a man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes, mark you that. If the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself (5.1.18-19). While "water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body," entering through the "hide" or skin (163-65), so too it seems to pose a threat to those living in the air, as "churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world," constituting a wet and eerily mobile atmosphere of airborne vapors. The seemingly absurd question of human agency in the matter of drowning leads us to the larger terms of the play's engagement with the comingling of air and liquid: Hamlet occupies a space in which the air itself is wet, and the sun unable - in metaphysical, dramatic, and clima-</page><page sequence="29">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 8 1 tological terms - to dry or clear the air. While Ophelia's death is glossed by Laertes as a form of elemental imbalance - "Too much of water hast though, poor Ophelia" (4.7.184) - healthy elemental transmutations are thwarted throughout the play. It is "in the morn and liquid dew of youth," after all, that "Contagious blastments are most imminent" (1.3.41-42), and without the balancing effect of sun under the rule of Claudius, aptly described as a "bloat King" (3.4. 1 84), liquid creates a palpably moist at- mosphere through imagery of pestilent vapors, lingering clouds, southerly winds, perspiration (or "fat"), leprous distilments, saturated brains, and "dews of blood / Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, / Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands, /[...] sick almost to doomsday with eclipse" (1.1.120-23). In light of recurrent attention to dew and its foul variants ("dews of blood" and "mildew"), it is suggestive that allusions to aerial saturation are matched with fantasies of human liquefaction and evaporation, not only in the contagious breath of yawning churchyards (be this a form of spiritual "purgation" or the bodies of the dead transmuting into "fat matter" in air), but in Hamlet himself wishing to melt: "O that this too too sullied [or "solid"] flesh might melt, / Thaw and resolve itself into a dew" (1.1.129-30). This uncanny image of somehow replacing his father is later displaced outward in a fantasy related to Gertrude, that "flaming youth [might] let virtue be as wax / And melt in her own fire" (3.4.84-85), and both images of solids turning to liquid are anticipated in the sentinels on seeing the ghost, who are "distill'd / almost to jelly with the act of fear" (I.ii.204-05). The problem of liquid was of course integral to purgatory - itself a place where fire purged sin of impure spirits (hence the unpurged form of the ghost, subject to purgatorial fires).71 But it was equally integral to climate theory and the frustrations of inhabiting an unhealthy atmosphere that seemed, in London, constitutionally resistant to the "melting," "distilling," or "resolution" of vapors. As Jean Fey ens put it in the 1580s, following Hippocrates: "A cold and moist air, as it is in the North, is like the Winter, stupifies the spirits, stops the pores, and burdens the body with many superfluous humours."72 The North here, a perpetual winter of discontent, stops up pores, making for "too too solid flesh" unable to evaporate, "melt, thaw, or resolve itself." In addition to engendering, as Mary Floyd Wilson has recently observed, a famously melancholy region,73 such a climate was also understood to breed far more fatal vapors, which entered in at the mouth but could not exit through the pores of the skin. During plague time especially, closed pores could inflame the interior of the body and hasten the progress of infection. At the same time, many, such as Thomas Moulton, warned that during</page><page sequence="30">1 82 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW periods of heightened atmospheric corruption, one should not exercise nor "sweat not to much, for all openeth the pores of a mans bodye, and maketh the venomous ayre to enter, and for to infect the blood, &amp; the spiritual members of man, &amp; for to destroy al lyuely spirits in man."74 The pores of the skin, then, be they closed through cold or opened through exercise and "sweat," are vehicles through which "venomous ayre" could destroy the "lyuely spirit." Given this, it is curious that while the etymological roots of Hamlet's name, "Ham," include the ever reso- nant "home" and "land," the word "ham" in Danish means, and meant, "skin." In environmental as well as psychological terms, Hamlet is not at home in his own skin, and he is unable to "let" or "shuffle off' his "mortal coil," nor can he release with "that within which passes show" (3.1 .67, 1 .2.85). In this respect, Hamlet's obsession with earthly matter, or, as David Hillman has pointed out, with accessing bodily interiors to penetrate surface and seeming, looks rather less like a search for epistemological certainty based on the exposure of inward matter than a search for a way out of his own skin - a way out of the materialist world in which he increasingly finds himself and, what's more, finds himself stifled, meaning suffocated.75 His desire late in the play to "drink hot blood," and hence become capable of action, motion, and revenge, might be seen as a compromised correlative to his more subtle, if melancholic, fantasy of elemental transformation (3.2.381). But Hamlet's dying wish returns to the domain of transmutation, not only in turning to God where analysis, hypothesis, and human agency reach their limit, but also in imagining his own afterlife as a form of breath issuing from Horatio's mouth. The afterlife of Hamlet, as play, depends of course on the medium of air as the medium of speech and theatrical performance - a medium that will, at least ideally, move, liq- uefy, melt, purge, and resolve the attentive auditor. Performance itself, in Hamlet's own advice to the players, is a delicate technology of the air, one that should not blast the ears but rather bring one to tears. Within Shakespeare's plays, in more general terms, a transmutation is always effected that transforms potential atmospheric casualties into dramatically situated social agents. To state the obvious: His characters don't die from the plague or venomous air, but rather they die from error, mischance, or love. Indeed, what is interesting is that in Shakespeare, potential vic- tims of the plague often become lovers or melancholies who might die for love. Given the imagery of disease and plague that riddles Romeo and Juliet, for example, it is suggestive that in an early version of the story, Juliet suffocates herself to death and, in Shakespeare's play, Lady Montague simply stops breathing: her grief "hath stopped her breath."76</page><page sequence="31">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 83 Conversely, the initial images of love as a kind of "choaking gall," or a "fume of sighs" that take shape as vaporous clouds (1.1.1 83-87) antici- pate Juliet's more morbid concerns of being left alone to breathe in the fumes of the dead: "Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, / To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, / And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?" (4.3.33-34). What if those "loathsome smells" of the vault, where "bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, / Lies festering in the shroud" (41-45), were placed front and center in interpretations of this play? The plague is, after all, a pivotal agent in the death of the lovers: Mercutio's thrice uttered "plague o' both your houses" (3.1 .87) is literalized as Friar John is blocked from delivering the letter to Romeo, in fact "sealed up" or quarantined "in a house" because of fears that he carries the "infectious pestilence" or plague (5.2.7-16). This short scene evoking communal fears of "infection" and the history of quarantine, in which persons were enclosed to breathe in their own bad air, closes with an image of Juliet: "Poor living corpse, closed in a dead man's tomb!"( 1 6, 29) It is as if the tomb becomes another site of "infectious pestilence" and quarantine, a "plague on both your houses" unmetaphorized at the play's close. But given this, it is important that it is less the plague and toxins of the air than the self-inflicted death and the tragedies of passion that domi- nate this play.77 The attribution of agency to persons and actors, even or especially as "instruments" of their own demise - in a world where that "unknown" agency of the air was riddled with supernatural fantasies and fears of sudden death - and the staging of forms of breathlessness as personally as opposed to elementally reactive, functioned as a kind of secular resuscitation. Remembering Irigaray's statement that "[n]ot be- ing perceived, air can serve as the base for mourning," for Shakespeare, the recoding of "air" over the course of his plays may, in many ways, work to facilitate a move from melancholy to mourning; opening up representational processes that encode affective and paradoxically living forms of death. For Shakespeare would transmute the infected air into something altogether different, turning fears of breathing into inspired dramas, where the "fog and filth" would produce, in Macbeth, "sighs, and groans and shrieks that rent the air," or in Twelfth Night and Romeo and Juliet, love that might "purge the air of pestilence" or, in Antony and Cleopatra, poison itself that might be "as soft as air, as gentle."78 The Romances take a more explicit direction in the use of technologies of art to reverse the effects of elemental disaster. But, more subtly, the affective dimensions of theatrical dissolution - actors "all spirits [. . .] melted into air, into thin air" - suggests a restorative poetics, a form of</page><page sequence="32">1 84 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW aerial purification and self-evaporation through which elemental trans- mutation might be thought, felt, accomplished. One need only skim the medical theories of the period to understand that being moved to tears, a form of audience-response, was itself a form of elemental alteration, self-evaporation, a "clearing of the air" of the self, soul, and environ- ment.79 Tragic catharsis, the emotional effect of dramatic representation on humoral physiology and psychological disposition, becomes in this respect an environmental phenomenon in its own right; it becomes an instrument through which to manipulate the air. In Hamlet, all manner of instruments through which the air might be manipulated tend to falter. We see this in the language of navigation, as Claudius puts Hamlet on a ship where the "bark is ready, and the wind at help," yet the ship proves "too slow of sail," easily overtaken by pirates (4.3.44; 4.7.16). We see this in the language of music, with Hamlet as a self-imagined "instrument," "pipe" or "recorder" through which his fel- low students might "go about to recover the wind of him but promptly fail (3.2.337-64). We see this in the language of meteorology, from weather "talk" to ghost sightings to cloud-gazing, where the instrument of the eye proves all too fallible in discerning the air. We see this in the language of mechanical artisanry, from the metaphoric and ineffectual "windlasses" of Polonius - a mechanical device used in mining as well as navigation to lure objects out of the depths (OED, s.v. "windlass") - to the less than effectual mechanics of the players. Indeed, the dramatized inability of artists to manipulate the air with skill, as in the case of players who might "saw the air" or characters who might stare blankly at a simple "pipe" without knowing how to use it, is not unrelated to the antiquated dramatic technology of staging a ghost emerging from hell-mouth calling for revenge - itself a form of theatrical transparency explicitly mocked as mere buffoonery or child's play in the Induction to A Warning for Fair Women (1599). Finally, we see the limits of instrumentalizing the air in the language of military engineering, where the very idea of an "enginer hoist with his own petard" returns in Horatio's recasting of the entire play of Hamlet as one "Of deaths put on by cunning and for'd cause, /And, in this upshot, purposes mistook / Fall'n on the inventor's heads" (5.2.388-90). These multiple dramas of failed instrumentality, with various engineers hoisted with their own petards, transposes a larger concern about the body itself as a vulnerable "instrument" through which the air might breathe or play upon at will, particularly as a nonhuman entity or haunt that "breathes out contagion to the world." It is in this transposition, however, that Shakespeare creates an instrument of tragic dramatic - as opposed</page><page sequence="33">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 85 to common atmospheric - consequence. For if this poet-playwright, to quote Hamlet, might have "beteem[ed] the winds of heaven" not to visit the "face too roughly" (1.2.141-42); if he wanted, in performance, to "saw the air ... but gently"; if he transferred the terrifying and de- instrumentalizing agency of air to the work of the mind, body, and soul, then it is this that constitutes for us what may be the most dramatic, haunting, and endlessly consuming "history of the air." If it is true that, to now recall our opening quotation by Bacon, "the Nature and Power of the Air is unknown," then Shakespeare transformed that terrifying unknown into something that might - even or especially in its elusive- ness to capture by scientific or theatrical technologies - be absorbed, experienced, and willfully taken in. Coda: Taking it In [W]hy do you go about to recover the wind of me? [ ] Do you think I am easier to be played upon than a pipe? -Shakespeare, Hamlet (3.2.360). I want to close with a brief coda by mentioning another kind of ghost in the "history of the air," c. 1600, what King James called "smoakie vapours" that were newly visible in London and the early modern theater: tobacco smoke, produced through that artificial or man-made "instru- ment," as Thomas Platter called it, "the pipe."80 A Warning for Fair Women (published anonymously in 1599 and earlier staged by Shake- speare's company, The Lord Chamberlain's Men), links stage ghosts with tobacco smoke: "a filthie whining ghost, / Lapt in some fowle sheet [. . .] / Comes screaming like a pigge half stickt, /And cries Vindicta, revenge, revenge: / With that a little Rosen flasheth forth, / Like smoke out of a Tabacco pipe (or a boy's squib)."81 Michael Almereyda's 2000 film of Hamlet also follows suit, where "vapours" body forth as cigarette smoke, filling a closed room as Hamlet is told about the ghost of his father and even emanating from the ghost himself, who also emerges in Hamlet's home-video - smoking. James Matthew Barrie's 1 9 1 5 My Lady Nicotine, a dream narrative of an ex-smoker, goes even further, offering a new historicization of Shake- spearean drama and Renaissance Culture: "The Elizabethan age might be better named the beginning of the smoking era. No unprejudiced person who has given thought to the subject can question the propriety of dividing our history into two periods - the pre-smoking and the smoking."82 Bar-</page><page sequence="34">1 86 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW Figure 2.

Prendergast for My Lady Nicotine (1915). rie imagines Spenser and Harvey smoking in bed and, in a particularly vivid moment, imagines Shakespeare, sitting in a corner, lighting up, and "as he smokes the tragedy of Hamlet takes form in his brain."83 What is suggestive here is the creativity associated with artificial or man-made vapors as well as the smoke produced by the instrument of the "pipe" as a simulation and enhancement of Nature's own power. The illustrations featured here (Figures 2 and 3), produced by Maurice Prendergast for My Lady Nicotine, first of the Shakespearean theater filled with smokers and smoke and second of smokers exiting Shakespeare's Globe theater - and indeed his other illus- trations of tobacco smoke bodying forth in the shape of ghostly figures - may not be so anachronistic. Tobacco smoke and perfume, as Andrew Gurr has observed, were the two strongest manufactured odors in the Renaissance theater: "Apart from perfumes, the most distinctive smell at the indoor playhouses, and in the lords' rooms at the amphitheaters, was tobacco."84 If we consider for a moment the rise of the "smoking era" in light of this essay, it may be worth considering what, if anything, smoking had to do with the inhala- tions and exhalations of the English air that were so often linked with the production of melancholy and the transmission of the plague.85 Although smoking was considered by many, including Bacon, to cure melancholy and other diseases, with the pipe itself being a medical "instrument,"86 S. A. Atkins devotes the final chapter of his Work for chimny-sweepers (1602) to argue the opposite, suggesting that the vapors of tobacco in fact function exactly like "myst of the outward aire," increasing the flow of melancholic vapors to the brain: The darke and smoakie fume, persing the cauities and ventricles of the brain, no otherwise, then a melancholy winde or adult va- pour (rising from an adult Liuer, or obstructed spleen) do breed in vs terror, and feare, discontentment of life, false and peruerse imaginations, and fantasies most strange, no way depending vpon just cause or grounds, and always a melancholy spirit, a fearfull and timorous mind.

At worst, according to Atkins, smokers could not only slip into a state "as dead men," leaving them vulnerable to take counsel from the devil (F4r), but tobacco could also "procure hastie and vntimely deaths" (E4V): [A] 11 melancholy persons, of what state or condition soeuer they bee of, and especially Students and Schollers, out to be very well aduised in the vse of so pernitious and dangerous a thing, least that in them, natural melancholy be conuerted into vnnatural, and this also, either into a corrisiue and adult humour apt to inflame the braine, or else [. . .] occasion a hastie and vntimely death. (G4rv) King James's Counterblast to Tobacco provides an explicitly climato- logical reading of tobacco, arguing against the notion that smoke was a hot and drying antidote to the cold and moist brain, and challenging its alleged powers of "distilling" the vaporous interior by instead linking it with the "cold and moist" air (the physical properties of English air that lead to illness and untimely death):</page><page sequence="36">1 88 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW [T]hat the suffumigation thereof cannot haue a drying qualitie, it needes to further probation, then that it is a smoake, all smoake and vapour, being of it selfe humide, as drawing neere to the nature of the ayre, and easie to be resolued againe into water, whereof there needes no other proofe but the Meteors, which being bred of nothing else but of the vapours and exhalations sucked vp by the Sunne out of the earth, the Sea, and waters, yet are the same smoakie vapours turned, and transformed into Raynes, Snowes, Deawes, hoare Frostes, and such like waterie Meteors, as by the contrarie the raynie cloudes are often trans- formed and euaporated in blustering winds. (B4r) Further, even as the smoky vapors sucked by the sun and stayed in the lowest and cold region of the air are contracted into clouds and turned into rain and such other watery meteors. So this stinking smoke being sucked up by the nose and imprisoned in the cold and moist brains is by their cold and wet faculty turned and cast forth again in watery distillations, and so are you made free and purged of nothing, but that wherewith you willfully burdened yourselves, and therefore are you no wiser in taking Tobacco for purging you of distillations than, if for preventing cholic, you would take all kind of windy meats and drinks; and for prevent- ing of the stone, you would take all kind of meats and drinks that would breed gravel in the kidneys. (B4V, emphasis added) What is remarkable is the extent to which smoking is configured in The counterblast as a volitional and mimetic model of breathing in the Eng- lish air - and indeed a mechanism through which to voluntarily "infect the aire" (Dlr). If, as Irigaray suggests in The Forgetting of Air, one can only see the air one breathes by smoking (or indeed through breathing in a cold atmosphere), it is suggestive that in the toxic breathing environments of early modern England, smoking tobacco emerged as a form of cultural conversation and communal activity in theaters, taverns, and homes in the morning and evening with meals.88 As I have suggested above, breathing problems integral to the plague became re-imagined in Shakespearean dramas as a breathing problems integral to melancholy and maladies of the psyche; atmospheric terrors became the stuff of emotional vicissi- tude.89 Further, however, the terror of breathing and the vulnerability of persons to the air arguably - and paradoxically - informed the discourse of smoking in early modern England, where what Dekker describes as</page><page sequence="37">THE HISTORY OF AIR / MAZZIO 1 89 the "ghost" of air was not only acknowledged and made visible, but even welcomed in.

Shakespeare, Hamlet (3.2.22). The idea that elemental mixtures productive of "heavy air" could function as "mirrors" goes as back at least to Aristotle's Meteorologica, a topic to which we shall return.

Despite early modern advances in ballistic technology, the measurement of projectiles, and various other technologies through which the air became subject to inquiry, this commonplace would itself remain to be "checked," as Bacon stressed as late as 1622 (see esp.

As Plato's Timaeus reads, "Let us now assign the geometrical forms to their respec- tive elements [. . .] The cube is the most stable of them because resting on a quadrangular plane surface, and the equal-sided triangle is more stable than the unequal. To the earth then, which is the most stable of bodies and the most easily modeled of them, may be assigned the form of a cube; to fire the form of a pyramid, and the remaining forms to the other element: to air the octahedron, and to water the icosahedron," The Dialogues of Plato, ed. and trans.

The rainbow and comet, of course, remain unobserved by the downward looking figures, as if these figures have not managed to see or perceive properly - neither in and through their eyes nor with the array of instruments strewn about. Christopher Wood has argued that Melencolia I evinces both the "blindness of drawing" and the "blindness of theory," a problem of composition between spaces of "outdoor" and "indoor" and between nature and the compositional spaces, such as the studio integral to contemplation ("Indoor-Outdoor, the Studio Around 1500," in Inventions of the Studio, Renaissance to Romanticism, eds. Michael Cole and Mary Pardo [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005], 36-72; see also 3 1 ).

See Bacon, Historia Ventorum: while "There is great quantity of subterraneal spirit required to shake or cleave the earth," wrote Bacon, the matter of finding "subterraneal places" or "prisons" of locked air was no easy matter: "to know such places of prisons, is very hard and difficult" (17, 46). 53.
