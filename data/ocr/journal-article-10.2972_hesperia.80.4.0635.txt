Although the meaning with  which the statues were imbued has varied in these contexts, they have retained  the status of sacred objects. As late as the 1960s, almost nothing was known about religious spaces in  the Middle and Late Bronze Age Aegean.1 The excavation of the temple  at Ayia Irini, on the northwest coast of the island of Kea, was the first in  a string of discoveries in the major settlements of the Cyclades and the  northeastern Peloponnese that have increased our understanding of reli- gion and religious spaces in these areas. Moreover, Ayia Irini offered the  archaeological world a spectacular and unparalleled religious assemblage  (especially for its period), consisting of over 32 terracotta statues, half to  three-quarter life-size, which were published by Miriam Caskey (Fig. 1).2  The cultural biography of these statues is the subject of this article.3 The approach followed here was initiated by Igor Kopytoff in 1986.4  Arguing that commoditization is a process and not a condition (an all-or- nothing state of being), he proposed a biographical approach to the analysis  of the value of things.5 Kopytoff suggested that when constructing the  1.

Indeed, biographies of things  cast in relief something that might otherwise remain obscure: “Objects are  not simple residues of social interaction but are active agents in shaping  identities and communities.”6 Thus, by observing how the meanings of  objects are defined and redefined in the different contexts in which they  are put to use, we gain valuable insight into the society that has adopted  and utilized them. In this article I explore the character of the Ayia Irini statues in their  various settings and describe the phases in their collective biography as  they were moved from one context to another. This approach reveals the  meaning with which they were invested through their involvement in  social interactions, informing us not only about the statues but also about  the communities that valued them. I examine the 3,600-year-old statues 6.

I argue that the statues preserved  a sacred character in all three contexts. During the Bronze Age, their  sanctity derived from their direct connection to the divine; in the Iron Age  they gained additional associations with mythical ancestors; and in their  current museum setting their sacred inflection stems from the nonspiritual,  but equally powerful, inclusion of the statues as antiquities within the  symbolic inventory of the Greek nation. The sacred character with which  the statues were endowed is a topos in their cumulative biography, and it  dictates an atmosphere of reverence and veneration that has secured them  against violation or infringement by human agency. The statues were discovered during the University of Cincinnati ex- cavations led by John L. Caskey in the 1960s and 1970s.7 The existence of  an ancient settlement at Ayia Irini had been known well before excavations  began.8 It was not until the 1950s, however, when Caskey was looking for  sites that would allow him to refine the Cycladic cultural sequence (as his  previous work at Eutresis and Lerna had done for the Early and Middle  Helladic sequence), that plans for a full-scale exploration of the site began.9 In the end, Ayia Irini turned out to be a much more interesting site  than Caskey had anticipated. Over the course of the excavations, which  continued on and off until 1976, Caskey uncovered an impressive settle- ment that had been established in the Early Bronze Age and reached its  floruit at the end of the Middle Bronze Age and in the early phases of the  Late Bronze Age, the period to which most of the extant remains date.  At that time the site was fortified with a sturdy circuit wall, a long stretch  of which still stands along its northern side.10 Contained within this wall  was an extensive town provided with a network of streets complete with a  drainage system and a series of private houses, as well as one monumental  structure (House A) interpreted as the house of the leader, and a sanctuary,  dubbed the temple, whose rooms were filled with fragments of dozens of  female terracotta statues (Fig. 1).11 7.

Caskey also suggests that  room 1 could have been an adyton, an inner sanctum to which only a se- lect few were allowed access on a regular basis.20 Indeed, the fact that this  room, the ancient nucleus, was not only preserved, but also converted into  the innermost space of the new oblong building, is telling. The choice to  preserve the initial form of the “old temple” while increasing its distance  from the entrance may indicate not only the venerable status of the original  structure, but also an effort to control and restrict access to the space and its  contents.21 The large collection of terracotta figures would have occupied at  least one-third of that dark room,22 creating an eerie experience for those  entering for the first time, as their eyes slowly acclimated to the darkness. The statues are freestanding and range in size from 70 to 120 cm  (Fig. 1).23 They all represent female figures wearing flounced skirts and  tight bodices that, to varying degrees, leave the breasts uncovered in typical  Minoan fashion. Some of the figures are adorned with garlands around  their necks, while their hair is arranged in long single locks that flow down  their backs. They are made of a distinctive local coarse reddish clay; some  preserve traces of red, white, and yellow paint.  Despite the difficulties inherent in establishing a strict chronological  sequence for these figures, some observations can be made. One of the  statues is definitely Mycenaean in date, since it was found in a LH III con-  text and none of its numerous fragments seem to join with statues from  other rooms.24 As for the others, M. Caskey considers it highly unlikely  that they were all made at the same time; she categorizes them into dif- ferent groups and interprets them as the products of different craftsmen  at different periods.25  How can the accumulation of a large number of statues over an ex- tended period of time be accounted for? One explanation is that it reflects  a long, cyclical process of production, use, and ultimately replacement and  storage.26 The decision to store the statues instead of disposing of them  after use indicates that they were not regarded as mere utilitarian objects;  they had a sacred inflection and thus could not be discarded or destroyed.27  Another possibility is that many of the figures were in use at the same  time. Scholars have long debated the nature of Minoan religion and whether  19. Caskey 1964, p. 327; 1971,  who notes that in Egypt cult images also observed that “fragments found  p. 385; Keos II, p. 4.

On the other hand, Caskey  </page> <page sequence="7"> a  cultural  b io g raphy  of  the  ay ia  ir in i  statue s 641 it was monotheistic or polytheistic.28 Arthur Evans was a proponent of  the monotheistic view and held that Minoan religion revolved around a  principal female deity, the Mother Goddess, who assumed or was wor- shipped in many guises, not unlike a medieval Madonna.29 More recently,  others have maintained that the Minoans, like their Mediterranean and  Near Eastern neighbors, venerated a pantheon of deities, some of which  were male.30 The statues might therefore be considered representations  of the many guises of a single goddess, or of several goddesses protecting  agriculture, renewal, and fertility.31 Whether the statues represented a single deity or many, it is reasonable  to assume that they were imbued with a sanctity that protected them from  the fates of more mundane objects. In ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Near  Eastern ritual, as well as contemporary Hindu practice, anthropomorphic  cult images are treated as manifestations of deities: the deity is present in  the image.32 Such rituals include not only prayer, sacrifice, and procession,  but also the dressing, bathing, and feeding of the images, a clear indication  that such representations are not merely symbols but the actual objects of  religious devotion.33 It is possible that the terracotta statues of Ayia Irini  were likewise perceived as the timeless, enduring representatives of the  deity or deities residing within the temple for the benefit of the settlement. The forms and features with which the inhabitants of Ayia Irini  endowed these statues, consciously or otherwise, tell yet another story.  Although the statues were produced locally, they are represented in a  costume characteristic of the elite women of the Aegean world and usu- ally interpreted as a product of contact with Minoan society.34 Indeed, the  material recovered from the buildings at Ayia Irini demonstrates that the  inhabitants enjoyed a high standard of living. This prosperity was probably  the result of the site’s location at an important maritime crossroads, which  allowed it to participate in the procurement of metal from Laurion and me- diate exchanges between Crete and the Greek mainland.35 These exchanges  supplied Ayia Irini with an abundance of imports that attest to the breadth  and strength of Kean trading contacts. Imported pottery from Crete, other  Aegean sites (including the eastern Aegean), and the Greek mainland was  plentiful throughout the Middle Bronze Age until the destruction at the  end of Ayia Irini Period VIIb, after which the mainland prevailed as the  almost exclusive source of imported wares.36 Other aspects of the material  culture of the site tell a story of the rise and fall of the Aegean “powers,” as  28.

Following the LM IB/ LH II destruction, the settlement shrank and was finally abandoned at the  end of the LH IIIB period. While settlement activity at the site appears  to have come to an end at this time, however, the temple itself preserves  evidence of use throughout the final phases of the Bronze Age, when it  suffered yet another destruction.41 Lost Ancestors Even after the destruction and general abandonment of the site at the  end of the Bronze Age, parts of the temple continued in use as places of  veneration. In the Iron Age, cult activity took place in rooms 1, 2, 3, and 6,  as attested by floor levels containing vessels of a ritual character, as well as  structures such as a bench (room 3, northeast wall) and shrine BB (room 6)  (Figs. 2, 5).42 Room 1, however, is the focus of this discussion, because of  the Iron Age shrine that was established within it.43 During the 8th cen-  tury b.c., a stone pavement (the “Geom. Shrine Floor” in Fig. 5) was laid  down and a structure of rough stone blocks was built on top of it in the  northwestern part of the room. The stone structure collapsed at some point  during the late 8th century b.c. and was removed by the excavators in  1963,44 revealing in situ a base in the form of a terracotta ring, surrounded  37.

Keos II, p. 9, fig. 1 by flat stones and supporting the worn head of a statue (Fig. 6).45 While  the southeastern part of the room continued in use as a shrine long after  the 8th century,46 the area blocked by the fallen stones has a terminus ante  quem in the later part of that century, as the pottery attests (Fig. 5).47 It is unknown how much earlier than the 8th century b.c. the head  might have been reclaimed from the ruins of the temple and put on display,  either in room 1 or elsewhere, or whether other statues or fragments were  similarly exhibited.48 What is clear is that early in the 8th century this  area was organized as a shrine: the statue pieces were reclaimed from the  Bronze Age ruins, put on display, and treated as a focus for ritual behavior.  In this respect, the temple at Ayia Irini is consistent with a wider pattern  observed at several sites of Iron Age date in Greece. During the 9th and  8th centuries, a multitude of Bronze Age sites, ranging in function from  sanctuaries to settlements and cemeteries, show continuous use or, in the  case of abandoned sites, reuse as centers of ritual activity. Indeed, some of  the most important rural and nonurban sanctuaries of the Classical period,  such as Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, Kalapodi, and Epidauros, as well as  the Argive Heraion, Eleusis, and the Menelaion near Sparta, seem to be  characterized by a Bronze Age heritage.49  45.

These  anchors, fastening on to a site of past significance, used the past to  lay claim to present power.51 Like cult activity at other Bronze Age sites, the continued use of the temple  at Ayia Irini anchored communities on Keos to the landscape and its past.52 Antonaccio also observes that “cult is located not only to structure  physical territory, but to articulate borders at points of contact between  different groups.”53 François de Polignac, using the Argive Heraion as an  example, has suggested that sanctuaries in the Iron Age were meeting  50.

During the Geometric period, the Heraion  at Prosymna was a “rural, even rustic, cult place with no notable building”  at a “halfway house” location, which probably functioned as a point of  mediation for the communities in the Argive plan.54 According to Polignac, most of the major rural cults can be considered . . . to have been   rallying and meeting points for the local populations.

To my knowledge, Ayia Irini offers the only case of the  reuse of a Bronze Age religious artifact in an Iron Age context in a focused  and intentional way. What did the head dug out of the ruins represent  to those who preserved it? I suggest that it was a tangible representation  of lost ancestors, and thus a focal point where the communities of the  island would gather to celebrate their common ancestry.57 At Ayia Irini,  that celebration would have taken the form of cult activity in the temple,  specifically at the shrine in room 1.58 At the center of the cult was the  statue head on its ring base, and perhaps other heads as well. The ar- chaeological evidence for ritual behavior includes the shrine, votive gifts  in the form of pottery and burnt offerings, and the reuse of a monumental  building, namely, the temple. The actual form of the ritual can, of course,  be questioned, since details of such activities are usually unrecoverable by  archaeologists.59  Despite the uncertainties, it is safe to say that the statue head became  the focus of ritual activity predicated on the perceived sacred character of  the object. For the inhabitants of the island, the statue head would have  alluded to the lost ancestors whose abode lay in ruins but whose lingering  memory led people from the surrounding area back to this abandoned settle- ment to worship. This veneration was supported by a long oral tradition  that included accounts of a union between the Kean princess, deep-girdled  Dexithea, and King Minos of Crete, which marked the beginning of a royal  lineage that flourished on the island. The remnants of this oral tradition  have survived the centuries in the words of Pindar and Bacchylides,60 and,  last but not least, in the work of Konstantinos Manthos, a local antiquarian  of the 19th century who reported the presence of a Minoan colony in the  bay of Ayios Nikolaos.61 57.

In this  phase, the statues were first transformed into archaeological objects, and  eventually into exhibits in a museum. Such a dramatic change of context,  character, and audience has a strong impact on the meaning of artifacts and  their perception by the public, as has been strikingly illustrated by Richard  Davis’s examination of audience responses to Hindu religious images.62 Davis demonstrates that the “appropriation, relocation, and redisplay  of an object” dramatically alter the perception of the object by different  audiences. Setting and presentation play integral and constructive roles in  the way an object is perceived, since they guide the attention of the viewer  in the act of observation and establish parameters for the range of physi- cal actions that can be directed toward the object.63 Moreover, according  to Davis, the viewer’s frame is not just a set of interpretive strategies but  something more global and diffuse, related to the viewer’s perspectives on  the cosmos, divinity, and expressions of identity.64  In one of his test cases, Davis contrasts and explicates audience re- sponses to images in a Hindu religious setting and in a North American  museum.65 In India, images enveloped in the religious aura and the colorful  sensual surroundings of the temple stand as the embodiment of a god who  transcends them and touches the viewer. In the North American museum,  however, the statues are stripped of all the ritual paraphernalia of their  original setting and set on a pedestal in an “austere exhibition mode.”66  The only item that contextualizes them is the label, which itself transforms  the statues into objects of art meant to appeal to the audience’s aesthetic  sensibilities. The differences in visual presentation and placement in these  two contexts, Davis notes, correspond to very different ontological and  moral premises held by the respective audiences: Indian cosmology versus  a Western, Cartesian outlook on the world, tempered by colonialism.67  Thus their “meanings,” as well as the comportment of the spectators, are  entirely different.68 Similarly, the transformation of the statues of Ayia Irini into archaeo- logical objects exposed them to an audience far removed from the worship- pers of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. Nevertheless, the treatment of  the statues following their discovery evoked reactions from modern viewers  and handlers that were in some ways quite similar to those we attribute to  62.

The most  prominent feature of the exhibition is the statues themselves. After walking  through a hall containing pottery and other artifacts from the excavations  at Ayia Irini and the nearby Neolithic site of Kephala, one enters a second  hall where the statues are on display. Twelve of the best-preserved figures  are presented in a transparent case in the middle of the room so that visi- tors are able to view them from all sides (Fig. 9); a separate case houses the  head from the Iron Age shrine. Approaching the exhibit, the visitor sees  the statues against the background of a large photograph of the temple  on the wall. This alignment of the artifacts with an image of the building  in which they were found is meant to remind the visitor of their original  context. The display of the statues together as a group and their location  in the second, inner room of the museum further evoke their presumed  placement in room 1 of the temple. The effort made by the designers of the museum to preserve the link  between the statues and their original setting invites the visitor to perceive  the statues as sacred. This effort is reinforced, especially in the case of Greek  tourists, by the national perception of antiquities in general, according to  which the statues are indeed sacred by the mere fact of their antiquity. From  the beginning of the formation of the modern Greek state in the 19th  century, antiquities were taken out of the private (and thus commercial)  sphere. Greek antiquities by law are the property of the state, regardless of  where they are found, whether on public or private land.74 Thus, the Greek  state has prevented antiquities from becoming commodities by making  them literally priceless, and by including them, along with the flag and the  Orthodox Christian religion, in the symbolic inventory of Greek society,  thereby bestowing on them a “sacred” character.75 Perhaps the most evocative illustration of the equation between  antiquities, the state itself, and cultural identity is an anecdote in the  memoirs of Yiannis Makriyannis (1797–1864), a general in the Greek war  of independence and subsequently a major contributor to the first Greek  constitution. Learning that some Greek soldiers were planning to sell two  ancient statues to Europeans, Makriyannis took them aside and admon- ished them not to sell the antiquities at any price, because “it is for these  that we fought.”76 With that simple utterance, which became legendary,  Makriyannis transformed antiquities from commodities to be sold into  singularized artifacts that symbolically belonged to the same category as  73.

In the visitors’ book at the museum, people record  their impressions, which resonate with a sense of mystery inspired by the  ancient figures. Many tourists, Greeks and foreigners alike, describe the  encounter as a discovery. Among the general public, the finds from Ayia  Irini are not widely known, and the initial assumption that this is another  provincial museum with a nondescript collection is proved wrong by the  epiphany of the statues. Moreover, among Greek visitors, a commonly  expressed emotion is a sense of pride in local Kean and national history.  In this setting the statues play the same role in ancestor worship as they  probably did during the Iron Age, albeit for a very different audience. concLUsIon Objects that escape the ravages of time and capture the interest and  imagination of diverse audiences, from pharaonic mummies to the kula  rings of the Trobrianders, undergo a transformation more far-reaching  than a simple change of environment or context.82 Group consensus usu- ally ascribes to the objects an alternative function or meaning in their new  setting. It follows, then, that as audiences or “communities of response”  change, the meaning of the objects is amended accordingly.83 It matters  not whether the new audience fully understands the former meaning(s) of  an object; in most cases the new meaning, value, and function bear only a  tangential relationship (or none at all) to its perceived values and functions  in former societies or contexts, since the meaning of an object is assigned  on the basis of cultural interpretive strategies that are learned, shared, and  susceptible to change.84 78.

In the three contexts I have examined—their original display or  storage in the Late Bronze Age temple, the redisplay of at least one head in  the makeshift Iron Age shrine set in the rubble of the destroyed temple, and  their exhibition in the modern museum—the statues are signs of “memories  of experience” enveloped in an aura of religious mystery constructed by the  respective worldviews of each group of viewers.85 In the Bronze Age, the statues were the timeless embodiments of the  many guises of the goddess or goddesses of the Minoan pantheon associ- ated with agriculture, renewal, fertility, and the prosperity of the settlement.  The figures were kept in a room sheltered from profane gazes and were  probably regularly accessible to only a few. Although we are unsure about  the details of their display and the rituals in which they were involved, their  careful preservation within the temple indicates that they were perceived  as sacred. On another level, these figures and the temple itself were the  tangible representations of the divine favor and prosperity that the com- munity enjoyed in the early stages of the Late Bronze Age because of its  role within the Aegean exchange networks. Despite the abandonment of the site and the destruction of the temple,  the figures did not lose their sacred character. As the reuse of at least one  head in a cult setting indicates, they continued to command reverence in  the Iron Age. The recovered head became the focus of a religious ritual that  functioned as a link to the lost ancestors who had inhabited the site in years  past and performed the great deeds commemorated in local mythological  tradition. Finally, the head anchored the local community in the landscape,  thus providing it with a sense of place while serving as a mediation point  for the communities of the island and beyond. In their modern setting, even after their designation as archaeological  artifacts and objects of art, the statues still have religious overtones. The  resilience of their sacred character, even in the museum context, might seem  odd, especially in comparison to the changes in the perception of the Indian  cult images discussed above when placed in a similar setting. In this case,  however, the secret lies in the conceptual intersection of the interpretive  strategies shared by both past and modern audiences. The centrality of  antiquities in the building of the Greek nation has transformed the statues  into objects of veneration to be curated by specialists and guardians and  displayed to the public in a way that is emotionally engaging and meaning- ful, since they constitute symbolic capital for the nation-state and a focus  of pride for an entire community. 85.
