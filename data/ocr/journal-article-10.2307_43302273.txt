<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foreword Massixnilano A. Polichetti "Formal elements are predetermined by minds , are heaps of minds , are made by minds." The above quotation from the Dhammapada ( Yamakavaggo , I - 1) introduces us to the topic to which this Special Edition is dedicated. The analysis of the link existing between form and mind is not only the first step towards every gnoseological definition of reality as an ontological unity, but rather the possibility of this analysis in itself indicates that when human beings produce "works of art" they are substantially shaping the subtle matter forming the plane sustaining the universal field of interaction. It is not my intention here to go deeper into the merit of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka Prasangika classifications of the ways of existence of phenomena, but just to recall the need for people interested in Tibetan art to comprehend at least the first qualifications related to the highly sophis- ticated ideology that constitutes the background of such a distinctive artistic production. Tibetan sacred art, through whatever physical medium it is expressed, refers back to a main determining reason. The thangkas, mural paintings, sculptures, miniatures and many specific elements of the architecture are indeed conceived in order to be utilised as perceptible supports for spiri- tual practice, informed by the principles regulating elaborate Vajrayana rituals. Moreover, this liturgical art is at any rate of immediate admittance for the worshipper. If on the one hand there are different stages of acqui- sition into the minds of the adepts (starting from simple devotion up to the highest attainments) related to the divine representations, at the same time i≈•s possible to ascertain a range of different ways of fruition of the sacred images, attitudes related to the contemplator's level of mindfulness. The most important function of this art reveals itself to be that of foster- ing the process of familiarity of the mind through the phases of medita- tion on a specified archetypal divinity ( Ishtadevata - Yidam), numen that can be expressed in evident anthropomorphic representation as well as through symbolical implements, geometrical specimens or syllables. Gradu- ally, the contemplator progresses through various levels of consciousness, at the end of which (s)he can transcend the need of the perceptible sup- port utilised up to then as a sort of "tool" to divinise the world. Tibetan sacred art expresses, in short, the attempt to engrave into the formal image</page><page sequence="2">FOREWORD 5 a sacred value, a vigorous valency evoked by a meditating mind in order to prompt it again to another meditating mind. Tibetan art also constitutes a unique bridge, an essential link between the relative and the ultimate, between what "seems to be" and what "really is", provoking unpre- dictable positive transformations in the consciousness that sincerely attempts an approach towards it. Having been entrusted as Guest Editor by the Library of Tibetan Works &amp; Archives, through the most kind courtesy of Ms Pema Khangsar, I had the pleasure of contacting close to 40 scholars from all over the world. For their kind advice regarding this undertaking in support of Tibetan culture, among them I wish to thank particularly Lokesh Chandra, David Jackson, Romi Khosla, Deborah Klimburg Salter, Fosco Maraini, Pratapaditya Pal, Thomas Pritzker, and Valrae Reynolds. Thanks also to Vyvyan Cayley for her helpful editorial comments in the final draft. Through the concern of the international support groups and above all by virtue of the compassionate and enlightened activities of His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama, knowledge of the Tibetan issue has spread also in the so-called "north" of the world, and the dramatic journey towards re- establishing human dignity in the "Land of Snows" continues. We - the historians of art, the archaeologists, the historians and philosophers of religion, the philologists and the architects - we do whatever we can, without much help or financial support, but with the certainty of serving a cause of truth and justice, the cause of the Tibetan people and of Tibetan civilisation, by preserving which we are actually preserving one of the best portions of human culture as a whole - in short, the best part of ourselves.</page></plain_text>
