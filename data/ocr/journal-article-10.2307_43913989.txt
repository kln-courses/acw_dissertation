Three teams work at NPS units in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean, with a total of 16 operating in the nation. These three EPMTs serve 37 park units that cover a total of 1.5 million hectares. The EPMTs augment existing exotic plant control efforts with inventory and monitoring, control, education, and research. Index terms'.

Aggressive invasive plants are causing ir- reparable damage to natural resources and disrupting the sensitive ecological balance that nature has achieved over thousands of years. National Park lands, as with other public lands, frequently exist as islands of natural communities, or lands protected in a specific historical state, surrounded by a disturbed landscape. These conditions provide invasive exotic plants excellent opportunities to colonize protected areas (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology As- sessment 1993). As a result, the NPS has developed a science-based strategic plan using the principles of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to manage invasive plants on NPS lands. The plan emphasizes prevention, coordinated management, and education. A fundamental component of the NPS invasive plant program is the Exotic Plant Management Team (EPMT). The EPMT program was established in 2000 as part of the Natural Resource Challenge (NRC) - a major effort to sub- stantially improve how the NPS manages its natural resources. The NRC calls for increasing the role of science in decision- making, revitalizing, and expanding natural resource programs, gathering baseline data on resource conditions, strengthening partnerships with the scientific community, and sharing knowledge with educational institutions and the public. The focus of the EPMTs is to provide the NPS with a first response program for invasive plants. The EPMTs also provide the parks with tech- nical assistance on all aspects of invasive plant management including prevention, education, inventory, monitoring, and coordination. There are currently 16 EPMTs around the country serving over 200 NPS units. Three EPMTs address plant management issues at 37 park units in nine southeastern States and the U.S. Virgin Islands: South- east (based in Asheville, North Carolina, and serving 18 parks - 121,406 hectares), Florida/Caribbean (based in Palmetto Bay, Florida, and serving 15 parks - 1.3 mil- lion hectares), and Gulf Coast (based in Beaumont, Texas, and serving four parks in the NPS Southeast Region and four parks in the NPS Midwest Region - 117,358 hectares). In addition to the EPMTs, the NRC also funds natural resource protection projects in the parks. One such project is a multi- park exotic management program based at Congaree National Park in South Carolina. The Southeast Coast Exotic Plant Manage- ment Project (SCEPMP) is a three-year initiative at 15 parks in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. This multi-year project employs the application of manual and chemical control techniques. The pro- gram is using park staff and volunteers, in cooperation with the Southeast Exotic Plant Management Team (SE-EPMT,) the Student Conservation Association, and the Georgia Exotic Pest Plant Council. 232 Natural Areas Journal Volume 27 (3), 2007</page><page sequence="2">FLORIDA/CARIBBEAN EPMT Tropical and sub-tropical climates make Florida and many Caribbean islands par- ticularly prone to exotic plant invasions. Natural and anthropomorphic habitat dis- turbances, combined with a large number of species introduced intentionally and unintentionally for ornamental and agri- cultural purposes, are major contributing factors to Florida's invasive plant man- agement problems. Invasive exotic plants infest over 607,024 hectares of the state's natural areas and rapidly dominate native plant communities, minimize biological diversity, disrupt natural processes such as fire regimes and water flow, and change the landscape both visually and ecologically. Exotic pest plants infest over 161,874 hectares of approximately 809,37 1 hectares of NPS lands in Florida. The Florida/Caribbean Exotic Plant Man- agement Team (FLCEPMT) supports 1 1 NPS units in Florida and four NPS units in the Caribbean by augmenting existing exotic plant control efforts with inventory and monitoring, control, education, and research. The FLCEPMT is a partnership with the Florida Department of Environ- mental Protection's (FDEP) Bureau of Invasive Plant Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's (USF- WS) Region 4 Invasive Strike Team, and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), as well as many other federal, state, and local government entities and NGOs working toward the management and control of invasive exotic plants. The FLCEPMT consists of resource managers from each partner park and representatives from the FDEP, SFWMD, USFWS, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (US ACE). The FLCEPMT identifies and prioritizes invasive plant control projects and functions as a steering committee. Invasive plant control is done primarily through private contractors using Indefinite Delivery/Quantities contracts. A "hit squad" composed of FLCEPMT members and volunteers from member parks accomplish small projects. Though the primary focus of the FLCEP- MT is control efforts, the team also works closely with other agencies on planning and monitoring. The FLCEPMT annually participates in aerially mapping invasive plant species in Florida (over 6 million hectares mapped to date) through coop- erative efforts with the SFWMD, USDA, Seminole Indian Reservation, USFWS, Southwest Florida Water Management Dis- trict, St. Johns River Water Management District, Florida Division of Forestry, and The Nature Conservancy. The FLCEPMT, in cooperation with the NPS South Florida Inventory &amp; Monitor- ing Network, has a protocol for testing the efficacy of exotic plant management ac- tions. The protocol establishes permanent plots prior to exotic treatment and then post-treatment sampling for several years. Sampling consists of composition/cover- age data gathering for trees, shrubs, vines, and the herbaceous layers as well as data collection from the light environment us- ing a spherical densiometer. The primary goal of this program is to: (1) determine how well the exotic removal treatment performed, (2) follow the recovery of the native plant communities, and (3) deter- mine if additional treatment or restoration management action is required. SOUTHEAST EPMT The temperate climate characteristic of much of the remainder of the southeast- ern United States is very similar to that found in portions of China and Japan. This similarity contributes greatly to the often- devastating success of plants introduced from those Asian countries. The floristic parallel between East Asia and the tem- perate southeastern United States is well documented, with many shared genera and plant families. As in other areas of the United States, habitat disturbance and fragmentation further contribute to the success of invasive exotic plants. The SE-EPMT, established in 2003, pro- vides support to 18 National Park Service "islands" located within the Cumberland Plateau, Appalachian Highlands, and Piedmont physiographic provinces in the Southeast. In addition, the team provides support for sections of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail in Virginia and North Carolina. The first priority of the SE-EPMT is to coordinate and prioritize treatment proto- cols with the resource management staff at each park. Plant inventories of the parks were, and continue to be, in various stages of completion. They provide a good basis, along with historical data, to identify the aggressiveness and severity of documented exotic plants. An Integrated Pest Manage- ment approach to control provides the framework for all management strategies employed by the team. Mechanical and chemical control methods, used both indi- vidually and in combination, are presently the most common control techniques. Cur- rently, no parks served by the SE-EPMT utilize biological controls for exotic plant management. As with all the NPS EPMTs, both education and outreach are an important component in the team's mission. The SE-EPMT provides training and technical support to numerous government and non-govern- ment organizations. These opportunities facilitate a forum to disseminate informa- tion about the exotic plant problems faced by NPS managers and the mission of the EPMT program. More importantly, they enable the development of partnerships to control exotics. In 2006, the team, with the Southern Appalachian Man and the Bio- sphere Program, provided the second in a series of exotic plant workshops for natural resource managers from the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. These agencies' lands border both the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. In addition, in 2006, the team joined with the Tennessee Exotic Pest Plant Council to produce educational publications on identification and treatment of exotic plants and to provide training to Tennessee State Parks' staff. As the team begins its fifth year of opera- tion, their emphasis is early detection and rapid response. Development of Coopera- tive Weed Management Areas and an ef- ficient system of disseminating information about watch-list species are priorities. In addition, in cooperation with the North Volume 27 (3), 2007 Natural Areas Journal 233</page><page sequence="3">Carolina Native Plant Society, the devel- opment of a 'park neighbors' educational program is underway. GULF COAST EPMT The Gulf Coast Exotic Plant Management Team (GC-EPMT) services eight NPS units in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi (four Texas parks are in the NPS Intermountain Region, and the other four are in the South- east Region) - a region of relatively warm year-round temperatures, high precipita- tion, and high plant diversity, including a wide diversity of exotic vegetation. These factors facilitate fast reproductive and growth rates of invasive exotic species. Exotic invasive species infest over 60,703 hectares of approximately 1 17,000 hectares of NPS lands in the Gulf Coast Region. As a result, the GC-EPMT employs early detection and eradication as its principal plant management strategy. The GC-EPMT focuses on eradicating new exotic popula- tions before they have a chance to spread to larger areas. Exotic plant populations appear to stem from three main sources: (1) ornamentals escaping from bordering private lands, (2) illegal dumps contain- ing landscape wastes, and (3) invasive plant populations associated with cultural landscapes within the parks. The GC-EPMT implements an educational campaign to help adjacent private landown- ers understand the threat of exotic invasive species. The GC-EPMT also requests landowners not to use certain particularly invasive species in their landscapes. Another GC-EPMT strategy is to contain, and thus prevent the further spread, of invasive exotics into undisturbed native plant communities. The team inspects illegal dumps and cultural sites and then eradicates all exotic invasive species as they are discovered. An added bonus of eradicating exotic invasive species at park cultural sites is that it often also helps the park achieve cultural restoration goals. Control techniques thus far have con- centrated on chemical methods, using an understanding of each species ecology and growth habits. The GC-EPMT treats sensitive sites in-house using a 'light hand on the land' approach. Non-sensitive sites (such as monocultures) are typically con- tracted, leaving the team free to pursue control efforts requiring technical solu- tions. Biological controls for the species in this region are not yet well developed and few mechanical methods are appropriate. In cooperation with the Florida/Caribbean EPMT, and utilizing the expertise of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricul- tural Research Service, the GC-EPMT is in the first year of a three to five-year effort to identify a biological control for Chinese tallow tree ( Sapium sebiferum L.). In hurricane-ravaged areas, the impending invasion of exotic plant species resulting from tree blow down and loss of canopy cover is being curbed with funding from the Public Land Corps (PLC). For example, the Jean Lafitte Barataria Preserve experienced severe canopy blow down from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, resulting in widespread germination in the canopy openings. A project to reduce the number of mature seed-bearing Chinese tallow trees in an effort to head off the impending inva- sion has removed more than six canopy hectares of Chinese tallow tree from the preserve, and the GC-EPMT expects to continue receiving PLC funding into the next fiscal year. Over the course of the next five years, the GC-EPMT is moving towards a landscape approach of exotic plant management. To that end, they are assisting Rice University with research plots located within the Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas. The research will determine the most efficient methods of treating arboreal exotic species in bottomland hardwood communities. This research should have implications throughout the Southeast by determining which age classes of the targeted pest plants are contributing to the majority of the reproductive success. The EPMT can then sweep an area, removing the targeted age classes and having the biggest impact on recruitment of the pest species in the ensuing years. CONCLUSION Since exotic invasive plants recognize no boundaries and cooperative efforts are critical to addressing their management and protecting public natural areas, the EPMTs are broadening their programs to include other managerial divisions (i.e., Cultural Resources, Facilities Manage- ment, Interpretation, etc.) within park units in identifying and prioritizing exotic plant management activities. Beyond park boundaries, EPMTs are expanding their participation with other federal and state agencies, NGOs, and citizen groups to address invasive plant management at the landscape scale. The continued successes of the EPMT concept relies upon building these public and private partnerships to efficiently prevent, control, and manage damaging exotic species now and into the future.
