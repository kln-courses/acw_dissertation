<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Handle with Care" - Notes on Stamp-Seal Impressions on Jar Handles and a Bulla from Early Iron Age Tell el-?Or?melT?l Kinr?t* By Stefan Miinger 1. Introduction Tell el-?Or?me (Hebrew Tel Kinr?t) is located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee ca. 11 km north of modern Tiberias. Its identification with the ancient town of Kinneret - mentioned in Biblical (Josh 19:35) and Egyptian sources - is undisputed. Since 2003, the Kinneret Regional Project - a Dutch-Finnish-German-Swiss expedition, which aims to ex plore Tell el-'Or?melT?l Kinr?t and its environs throughout the times - carried out archaeo logical excavations at the site. Juha Pakkala, J?rgen Zangenberg and the author direct this European project on behalf of the Universities of Bern, Helsinki, Leiden and Mainz '. Ever since the first field season in 2003, work focused on a large excavation field (/. e. "Field I") in the lower city with undisturbed Iron IB architecture and installations. In this area the architecture was fully unearthed and subsequently conserved in order to present to the public the extraordinarily well preserved remains of a highly organized and well-planned urban center roughly dating back to the time of the first kings of Israel/Judah. The particular find category, which shall be presented in the following, is not often accounted for in discussions of the material culture of the Early Iron Age, as not many such finds have been reported to date. They are stamped (or sealed) jar handles that were found among many other finds in the settlement layers of the main Early Iron Age horizon2 at Tell el-Or?me/T?l Kinr?t. These items do not only complement the iconographie repertoire of * I am happy to present this short paper to Prof. em. D. Dr. Walter Dietrich, who triggered my passion for the archaeology of the southern Levant and literally enkindled my affection for the site of Tell el-(Or?me/Tel Kinr?t. Without his constant support and encouragement the current expedition would never have come into existence. - I am indebted to Naomi Shepherd (Bern) for copy-editing this article. My thanks also go to registrar Tuula TYNJ? (University of Helsinki) for providing me with some registration details of the objects discussed in this article and to my colleagues and friends Prof. Dr. J?rgen Zangenberg (Leiden University) and Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Zwickel (Johannes Gutenberg-Universit?t Mainz) for their critical comments. 1 For a general overview of the history of excavations and the results achieved by the previous expeditions, cf. Fritz 1978; 1993; 2008 and Fritz/M?nger 2002; on the current excavation project cf. Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004; Zangenberg/ M?nger/Pakkala 2005; M?nger/ Zangenberg/Zwickel 2006; Pakkala/Tynj?/Valkama 2006; Pakkala/Saarelainen/Val kama/M?nger/Zangenberg 2008; M?nger 2008; M?nger /Pakkala /Zangenberg 2009. 2 For this new stratigraphie assessment of Tell el-c Or?me IT?l Kinr?t, cf. m?nger 2005a, 88. For the sake of simplicity, the previously used terms Stratum VI, V and IV, used to designate the Early Iron Age remains, are customarily retained here. The former two Strata roughly correspond to the found ing and to the main phase of the Early Iron Age, whereas the previous Stratum IV only inadequately represents the multi-phased post-destruction habitation at the very end of the Iron Age I.

The Corpus 4 Up until now, thirteen handles bearing impressions were found in the excavations made since the 1990's5; of these, nine shall be presented here. They are most likely of an Early Iron Age origin6. 3 Regarding Early Iron Age finds see, e. g., Albright 1926; Dietrich/Munger 2003, 43-44; Fass beck /M?nger/R?hl 2003, 50-51; Pakkala/Munger/Zangenberg 2004, 22-25; Saarelai nen 2007a and 2007b; Monger 2007b; Pakkala / S a arelainen / Valkam a / M?nger / Zangen berg 2008, 203-205. In fact, one of the most famous finds from Tell el-(Or?melT?l Kinr?t - a bronze figurine of a seated god found in the debris of the Iron Age II gate in Area D (Fritz 1990, 113 ? 115) - may belong to the Iron Age I as well (for comparable finds, cf. Keel/Uehlinger 1998, ?68). 4 Note the following conventions: - A capital letter followed by a number (e.g., H6) refers to the 'List of Hieroglyphic Signs' in Gardiner 1957, 438-548. - Parallels marked * are of unknown stratigraphie attribution, or have none at all; indicates an uncertain stratigraphie attribution or find context; 0 designates a surface find. - Parallels have been included only if corresponding material from authorized excavations is avail able (comparanda kept in museums or private collections are cited only if essential to the discus sion). No comprehensive presentation of parallels was attempted. - This report follows the nomenclature and chronology of the southern Levant according to Stern (ed.) 1993 (except for the absolute dating of the Iron Age I, cf. monger 2003 and 2005a); for the dates of the Egyptian dynasties cf. von beckerath 1997. 5 For seal impressions on handles previously found at Tell el-?Or?melT?l Kinr?t, see Darsow 1940, Taf. 24e and Fritz 1990, pi. 104,1-4. Another Early Iron Age impression on a pithos handle displaying a single scorpion that was found at the foot of the Tell was reported on by Stepanski 2000, 16 with fig. 24 and 11*. Single scorpions in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age glyptic material of the southern Levant were, e. g., found at Acco/Tell el-Fuhh?r: Keel 1997, Akko no. 138; *Tell el-Agg?l: Keel 1997, Tell el-cAgul no. 342; Megiddo/7e// el-Mutesellim, Stratum VIII and VILA: Loud 1948, pis. 152,155 and 162,162,11; Tell es-S?f?, Stratum E4a: Keel/M?nger in print: no. 4 with further references in n. 6; Shiqmona/7^// es-Samak, Stratum 16: Elgavish 1994, fig. 10. Sealings depicting scorpions were found at Sah?b, tomb Area A, Phase I, Level 4: Eggler/Keel 2006, Sahab no. 5 (impression on the rim of a collared-rim jar) and Tell Gal?l: Eggler/Keel 2006, Tall Dschalul no. 5 (impression on bulla); on the motif of the scorpion see now Zernecke 2008. 6 Not included in this overview are the following: - A trifoliate stamp-seal impression almost void of traceable decoration ( 34.4 mm; Reg. no. 06240/1, Locus 3055, Local Stratum H2 = VI) that is very similar in shape to so-called Am?q Seals (Meyer 2008), which are only very rarely found in the southern Levant (Keel 1995, ?236). - An oval shaped impression displaying a linearly engraved geometric pattern originating from a Middle Bronze Age scarab (fritz 1999, 111 with fig. 10,2; 13.9 8.9mm; Reg. no. 08573/1, Locus 5121, Local Stratum K2 = V), cf. Tufnell's design class 6C1 (Tufnell 1984, pi. 26,2133 2155) that is dated from the 13th Egyptian dynasty until the beginning of the Late Bronze Age period, with single outliers belonging to the Ramesside period (Keel 1995, ?500; Ben-Tor attributes this motif exclusively to the later Middle Bronze Age IIB within her 'Late Palestinian Series', cf. Ben-Tor 2007, 170 with pi. 89,15-37, but see also 90). - A very faint, oval impression on a handle (20.8 x 13.0mm; Reg. no. 12045/4, Locus 5406; Local Stratum W3 = V) presumably showing an animal facing to the right (lion?/bird?). - A round impression on a handle fragment was found in topsoil (0 25.2mm; Reg. no. 04237/1, Locus 3108, Local Stratum HO = Surface). Its iconography is indistinct, but may be similar to Early Iron Age conoids from Tell Gezer, Fourth Semitic Period (shuval 1990, no. 38), Megid do/Tell el-Mutesellim, Stratum VIIA (Shuval 1990, no. 74), Pella/Tabaq?t Fahil, Iron Age I-IIA context (Eggler/Keel 2006, Pella no. 13) or ^Shiqmona/re// es-Samak (Shuval 1990, no. 75). ZDPV 125 (2009) 2</page><page sequence="4">Notes on Stamp-Seal Impressions and a Bulla from Early Iron Age Tell el-'Oreme 119 All of them were found within the material culture of the Early Iron Age horizon7 or show an iconography that is paralleled by stratified items. Unfortunately, however, only one item was found on a floor (object no. 8). Furthermore, none of the handles could be attributed to a specific vessel type with certainty8, but in all likelihood they all derive from large to medium sized jars that were - according to the individual clay matrixes - locally made. The color of the clays used is in most cases reddish brown, but very pale brown occurs as well (objects nos. 3, 4 and 7). To some degree the impressions show similar iconographie stylistics, as they were all stamped by boldly engraved seals of 21.8-34.4 mm in length. They lack fine linear elements or hatching. Three different motifs are represented. 2.1. Motif A: Rearing Uraei (Object No. 1; Fig. 1,1; Taf. 8,1) This motif is found only once in the present selection of sealings. It is horizontally arranged and shows four upright standing or rearing uraei (cobras), which are arrayed in pairs that confront each other. The central two uraei are addorsed, their tails are seemingly linked. A large nb (V30)9 serves as an exergue. The line, that originally enframed the scene, is only partially preserved. Rows of uraei are most typical of the Ramesside period10. Scarabs with similarly deco rated bases - and equally lacking the otherwise typical crowns on or sun-disks above the heads of the uraei - are found, e. g., at Beth Shean/7^// el-Hisn in Level VII or in tomb 934 at Tell el-F?r'a (South)11. The image of the uraeus (jcrt; 112/13)12 stands for protection against evil and thus has an apotropaic function. If multiplied, this quality is considered to be even more intense 13. 7 It should be noted that the sealings were predominantly discovered during pottery reading, as they are, when covered by mud and dirt, only barely visible to the naked eye during the excavation process. 8 Except for handle no. 3 for which one might assume that it actually belonged to a Syrian-type amphora, typical of the Early Iron Age assemblage at Kinneret. For this type of vessel cf. Munger 2005c, 86-87 with fig. 1; add to the parallels mentioned there Oan/Tell el-Q?d?: Ilan 1999, pis. 3,6 and 5,6 (Stratum IVB), 53,7 (Stratum VI) and 62,5 (Stratum VIIA-VI) and Tell Afis: Venturi 2000, fig. 7,13. Such vessels were also found at Tel Dover on the northern bank of the Yarmuk River (personal communication Dr. Samuel Wolff [Israel Antiquities Authority]); also note the similarity to a vessel found at Mount Ebal, Stratum IB: Zertal 1986-87, 140 with fig. 17,2. 9 Cf. Keel 1995, ?171. 10Keel 1995, ?530; add to the many references given there stratified items from, e.g., Ashkelon/fAs qal?n: Keel 1995, Aschkelon no. 64; Tel B?t?sITell el-Bat?s?, Stratum V: Brandl 2006, no. 11 (with a multitude of Egyptian and southern Levantine parallels); Tell Dir Alla, Phase E: eggler/Keel 2006, Tall Deir cAlla no. 5; Megiddo/7W/ el-Mutesellini, Stratum VIIB: loud 1948, pi. 152,172. A bulla with an impression showing the same motif was recently found at Tell es-S?fi in Stratum A3 in a Late Iron Age IIA context, cf. Keel/Munger in print, no. 6. 11 Rowe 1940, pi. 36,17; MacDonald/Starkey/Harding 1932, pi. 53,206 (the nb is missing). A row with three uraei above a nb without any further elements is, e.g., found at Matmar (Brunton 1948, pi. 48,33) or Megiddo/7W/ el-Mutesellim, Stratum VIII (loud 1948, pi. 152,162). Five uraei in a row also lacking crowns or sun-disks are found on an oval piece with a sheaf-shaped handle from Ashkdon/Asqal?n, Iron Age II context (Keel 1997, Aschkelon no. 108). Note that the uraei on these items are all facing to the right. 12 Cf. Keel 1995, ?522. 13Hornung/Staehelin (ed.) 1976, 134. ZDPV 125 (2009) 2</page><page sequence="5">120 Stefan M?nger 2.2. Motif : Striding Lion (Objects Nos. 2-3; Fig. 1,2-3; Taf. 8,1-2) The motif of the striding lion occurs twice on the sealed handles from Tell el-Or?me/T?l Kinr?t and because the two impressions are almost identical, it is obvious that they both originate from two very similar seals. The animal is facing to the left. Its long tail is bent over its back. No additional elements are present. In view of the Early Iron Age iconography, the animal can be clearly identified as a lion14. Though the form of the lion's head on the present sealings generally conforms to Early Iron Age leonine imagery15 - see, e.g., items from Lachish/7^//ed-Duw?r, tomb 181 or Tell es-Sa'ldlye, tomb 118 16 -, its posture (including the long, bent tail) is much more in agreement with somewhat earlier specimens found in Late Bronze Age contexts at, e.g., Gezer/7H/ el-Gazan, Cave 10A or Megiddo/7&lt;?// el-Mute sellini, Stratum VILA17. Note that the lion - though in fragmentary state - is confirmed in the Early Iron Age glyptic material at Tell el-Vr?me/T?l Kinr?t as well (fig. 2)18. Fig. 2. Striding lion above a baseline with a uraeus to the right on the base of a scarab (surface find in Area D; drawing by Christa Lennert). 14 Astonishingly, none of the cited parallels for object no. 2 in Fritz/Vieweger 1996, 98 actually refers to Early Iron Age imagery. All of them - except for the item from ShiloIHirbet S?l?n (cf. . 45 below), which features an iconography dating to the New Kingdom - are of a Middle Iron Age or even a later date. 15 For a short overview cf. Keel 1990b, figs. 28-37. 16 Tufnell 1953, pi. 44A/45,130; Pritchard 1980, figs. 23,8 and 58,6. 17Seger 1988, pi. 13,15 and 75H; Loud 1948, pi. 152,201. l8Enstatite, 12.9 10.7 5.9mm; Reg. no. 13132/1. The item belongs to the 'Early Iron Age Mass Produced Series' (cf.

Nevertheless, as the motif does not necessarily show direct Egyptian influence,9, one might assume that the lion on the present items gen erally "als Amulett Kraft und Ansehen verlieh und alles B?se fernhielt."20 2.3. Motif C: Anthropoid Figure (Objects Nos. 4-9; Fig. 1,4-9; Taf. 8,4-9) Most outstanding in the present assemblage are impressions displaying a standing anthropoid figure. Apparently, all impressions derive from different seals of various size and shape. The figures are either facing to the left or to the right and are generally in a static position, except for no. 8, where a certain motion is observable. In all cases one arm is raised behind the figure's head, whilst the other arm - if the state of preservation allows such a statement - is holding a straight, vertical element that is sometimes thickened on top (no. 4) or at the bottom (no. 5). In four cases - object nos. 4-5, 8 and possibly 9 - there is a round element behind the figure's back. In the current assemblage dress style and headgear are not normally emphasized, however nos. 4 and 8 seem to indicate a tapered cap and no. 7 suggests that the figure is wearing a short kilt. The pose of the figure with its hand raised in a menacing gesture21, accords well with the known iconography of the Syro-Egyptian God Reshef22, who is - as on the present sealings from Tell el-'Or?melT?l Kinr?t - holding a shield. The interpretation of the vertical line as a shield is most obvious on objects nos. 4-5. Alternatively, one could construe it as a bow, a javelin or a sword. While the latter two valuations should be dismissed from the outset, since the element in question is either too short23 or would require a different bearing, the first option24 also lacks a sound basis, since the line is straight and the usual arrow and bowstring25 are missing. This is true despite the fact that in some cases the arrow and the figure's arm holding the bow are merged in the glyptic art of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age periods26 and that the missing bowstring is typical for contemporary 'Early Iron Age Mass-Produced Series' items27. 19 Fritz 1999, 112, considers the lion impressions from ancient Kinneret to be influenced by Syrian glyptic art. 20 Keel 1990b, 351; see also Strawn 2005, 131-228. 21 In several cases, menacing gods are weaponless; cf., e.g., Cornelius 1994, nos. RR5 (stela from Zagazig), RM1 (cylinder seal found at el-Amarna), RM 12 (scarab of unknown provenience), RM 13 (oval pendant from M?net el-B?d? near Ugarit). 22For an overview on this deity cf., e.g., Xella 1999, Uehlinger 2001 or Niehr 2003 with further literature; regarding its iconography, see especially Cornelius 1994, especially 255-259; 1998 and forthc. 23 But see, e. g. the short thrusting that is brandished by a standing figure carved onto a miniature limestone altar found at Gezer/7e// el-Gazan, Stratum 6B: Dever (ed.) 1974, pl. 41,2 and 75A. For the image of a (human) warrior holding a spear and a bow, which is impressed on a handle, cf. e. g. Ash?o?/Esd?d, Stratum IX: Keel 1997, Aschdod no. 2. 24 Advocated by Fritz 1999, 112. 25 E.g. Keel 1977, figs. 5, 8, 11-13, 20-24, 27. 26 Cf. Keel 1977, figs. 6, 9, 14-15, 25-26, 33-35, see also Tell QasTle, Stratum XII: Mazar 1950-51, fig. 13a and pi. 37,8. In those instances, however, the posture of the other arm is charac teristically bent indicating the drawing of the bowstring. 27 Cf. . 18; examples are Tell Abu Sal?ma: P?trie 1937, pl. 6,57; Acco/Tell el-Fuhh?r.

The god Reshef is - following Late Bronze Age traditions - quite well represented in the material culture of the Early Iron Age Levant and beyond30. Impressed in clay he is, - in a much different stance though - e.g., found on a bulla from Tell K?s?n, Stratum 9a31, standing an ibex and accompanied by the god Baal32. Figurative representations showing this deity bearing a shield, however, are absent in the Iron Age I in the southern Levant33, but do occur in Late Bronze Age and early Iron Age IIA contexts, e.g., on an oval, double sided inscribed piece34 from Gezer/7^// el-Gazar?, Cave 1939, pl. 67/68,3; *T?l Rekes (unpublished); Tell Ta'annek, Stratum IB: Lapp 1967, 34-35, fig. 24 (upper left, second item from the right). - In view of these examples, the attribution of an only partly preserved stamp-seal from Stratum D-6/D-5 at Tel Reh?vITell es-S?rem to the 'Early Iron Age Mass-Produced Series' (EIAMS) by Keel/Mazar 2009, 64*-65*, which displays an archer with a stringed bow together with at least two animals, is for several reasons definitely erroneous and misleading: - The scarab is with a length of over 20 mm much larger than regular EIAMS scarabs (only 2.65% of the presently known EIAMS items found in legal excavations are taller; the maximum length is 22.9mm, cf. Tell el-F?r'a [South]: Petrie 1930, pl. 31,284 [tomb 533]). Large EIAMS mark the first stage in the production process of this series (cf. monger 2005b, 394). - The object itself features a plastically modeled pronotum and oversized humeral callosities, which are characteristics that can only rarely be observed on EIAMS-items (see, e.g., Petrie 1930, pis. 33,380 [tomb 610] and 35,398 [tomb 117]). - It goes without saying that the bold engraving style, though typical for the EIAMS, is also in evidence for the glyptic art of the Late Bronze and the Early Iron Ages (cf., e. g., the iconograph ically similar item from Mount Ebal, Stratum II: Brandl 1986-87, with figs. 1.1,2 and pi. 20,2). - Moreover, the iconographie elements are largely foreign to this glyptic group, which lacks - as mentioned above - archers with stringed bows and horned animals with bent antlers (scimitar horned oryx?; an exception might be an item in the inventory of the Bible+Orient Museum in Fribourg, Switzerland; cf. Matouk 1977, 169 no. AJ VI.2, 354 no. 1651, 403 no. 1694). Equally, the only partly preserved hindquarters of a second animal on the Tel Reh?vITell es-S?rem item do not find any analogy in the presently known set of motifs of the EIAMS (cf. monger 2003, figs. 1-2 and 2005b, pis. 23.1-23.9). Therefore, the faulty chronological conclusions of Keel/Mazar 2009, 65*-66*, regarding the dating of the EIAMS should be dismissed and the complex iconography of the item under discussion - due to the striking iconographie similarities - reassigned to a comparable scenery that Giveon identified as the 'Pharaoh's killing of an oryx and a rhinoceros' (Giveon 1978, see especially the surface find from Tell Ta'annek 82 with fig. 39). The scarab from Tel Reh?vITell es-S?rem is thus in no way to be connected with EIAMS items as already indicated by its stratigraphie position, which clearly predates their earliest occurrence in Egypt and the Levant (cf. monger 2003, 73-76 and 2005b, 397-400 with Table 1). 281 thank PD Dr. Alexandra von Lieven (Humboldt University Berlin) for suggesting this to me. In fact, remnants of stringed instruments are present among the finds from Early Iron Age Kinnert, cf. Marom/Bar-Oz/M?nger 2006 and Dumbrill 2007. 29 Cornelius 1994, 55-56 and 250, Table 8. 30 Keel/Uehlinger 1998, ?66; Cornelius 1994, passim. 31 See footnote 73 below. 32 This is a typical 'Early Iron Age Mass-Produced Series' motif; cf. monger 2005b, 395 with figs. 14-17. 33 For Egyptian representations of Reshef dating to the 18 th and 19 th dynasties and for Late Bronze Age specimens from Phoenicia, cf., e.g., Keel 1990a, figs. 64-67. 34Type II; cf. KEEL 1995, ?206-208. Such items are typical of the 18th Egyptian dynasty.

Yet, an often overlooked find, but a very fine parallel to the Reshef impressions from Tell el-{Or?me/Tel Kinr?t - iconographically as well as geographically and chronologically - comes from nearby Hazor/7^// Waqq?s 31. It is a fragment of a handle that was possibly incised only after firing that shows a Syro-Hittite deity wearing a short skirt, a pointed hat and upturned shoes. The figure is holding with one arm a shield that is reduced, like on the present items under discussion, to a vertical line. The other arm is raised. It is not clear whether it is holding a weapon. Although it was found on the surface of the Tell, the shard was dated to the Late Bronze Age by the late Y. YADIN, the famous excavator of Hazor/Tell Waqq?s38. Fig. 3.

Note that Rubensohn rightly compares this seal with Hittite comparanda, i.e. Hogarth 1920, no. 317, although the circular element is placed in front of the figure on the latter item. Equally, a scarab made of blue glass from a museum collection (Hornung/Staehelin [ed.] 1976, no. 661) has a base engraving that is very similar to the sealings from Tell el-cOr?melT?l Kinr?t.

Discussion Compared to the previous and later periods 39, the paucity of seal impressions on handles dating to the Early Iron Age is astonishing40. They are attested only at a handful of sites including (*)Bethel/??fm41, WD?b?n42, ^Hirbet es-Sir43, (*)Megiddo/7i?// el-Mutesellini44, Shi\o/Hirbet S?l?n (Stratum V)45, Tell el-'Um?r?

Even if one includes other sealed vessel parts 48, this number does not overwhelmingly increase49 (note that inscribed jar handles dating to the period under discussion 39Keel 1995, ?299-313. 40 It should be noted that impressions of Early Iron Age seals on later vessels and chronologically non-attributable (surface) finds are excluded from the following overview. Examples for such are: Bethany, Roman columbarium: Saller 1957, 195 pl. 11 Id; Tell el-F?r(a (North): Chamb?n 1984, pl. 80,10 = dumortier 1996, pl. 7,41 (contra dumortier, the motif is typical of the Late Bronze Age II, cf.

Despite other claims of Singer-Avitz that a seal impression on a krater handle found in a construc tional fill of Stratum III at Kadesh Barnea/7e// el-Qud?r?t should be "dated to the New Kingdom (19th and 20th dynasties)" (Singer-Avitz 2008, 76), /. e. 1292 -1075 b.c.e., this author still adheres to his original dating of this item to the "Iron Age IIA(?)-B", which was proposed - and substan tiated - in the original publication (monger 2007a, 241). 41 Kelso/Albright 1968, 88 ?359 with pl. 114,11. In addition to the parallel given by Keel 1995, ?303 - Sellin /Watzinger 1913, pl. 42g - one could also refer to equally large Iron Age I seals with a similar decoration that were found, e.g., at Tell B?t Mirsim (Stratum C), Megiddo/7W/ el Mutesellim (Stratum VB), Tell el-'Or?me/T?l Kinr?t (main Early Iron Age horizon), ^Sah?b and MTell el-'Um?r?, see monger 2007b, no. 7 with references given there. 42Eggler/Keel 2006, Dhiban nos. 2-3. 43 Eggler /Keel 2006, Chirbat as-Sir no. 1. 44 The dating is assumed as "based on the 2nd-millennium appearance of the material combined with the local, Iron Age style of the impression", cf. S ass 2000, 409 with fig. 12.47,1. 45 Brandl 1993b, 215-216 fig. 8.14. 46Five stamped handles were found altogether, cf. Eggler/Keel 2006, Tall al-cUmeiri nos. (*}14, 48, 57, 64 and 68. Note that only nos. 48 and 64 derive from clear Iron Age I contexts, all others were found in later deposits. 47 Eggler/Keel 2006, Tall Safut no. 6. 48Possible examples are Hirbet el-Hagg?r (Eggler/Keel 2006, Chirbat al-Hadschdschar no. 5), (*&gt;7W/ en-Nasbe: McCown 1947, pi. 55:81), Sah?b, tomb Area A, Phase I, Level 4 (Eggler/Keel 2006, Sahab nos. 5-9), *Shilo/Hirbet S?l?n (FlNKELSTEiN 1988, 280 with fig. 95), Tell el-'Um?r?, late Iron II context (Eggler/Keel 2006, Tall al-cUmeiri nos. 35 and 61; another sealed rim of a collared-rim jar found during the 2008 field season is yet unpublished, personal communication Prof. Dr. Larry G. Herr, Canadian University College). 49 Given the fact that all of these impressions are placed near the rim of vessels (the location of the seal impression on the Tell en-Nasbe shard is not known) and - partly - because of their iconography, one should not rule out a predominantly apotropaic function (in analogy to other stylistic elements like, e.g., snake motifs, cf. Keel 1992, 196-198). ZDPV 125 (2009) 2</page><page sequence="10">Notes on Stamp-Seal Impressions and a Bulla from Early Iron Age Tell el-'Or?me 125 are lacking completely50). The assemblage from Tell el-'Or?meITel Kinr?t thus almost doubles the Early Iron Age corpus of Cis- and Transjordan. It is important to note that impressions on handles (as well as other sealed vessel parts) dating to the Early Iron Age are mostly found on the Jordanian plateau and in the central hill country (cf. fig. 5). Evidently the practice of marking vessels with seal impressions was unknown in the coastal plains and in the south during the period under discussion. The iconography of the seal impressions of the Early Iron Age ranges from simple geo metric patterns to animal scenes following local traditions. In a few cases though, they display complex imagery inspired by Egyptian or Syrian archetypes or deriving from imported seals. Nevertheless, none of the sites mentioned above features such an accumulation of sealed vessel parts with a similarly restricted cluster of motives that is comparable to the situation at Tell el-? Or?meITel Kinr?t51. While incisions applied on vessels after their firing most probably connote private ownership or ad hoc labeling of contents etc., pre-firing marks, /. e. 'potter's marks', point to utilitarian mechanisms in the manufacturing process52. Though it cannot be ruled out that isolated sealings on vessels actually functioned as marker's marks, indicated ownership or simply served as decorations53, another interpretation for the sealing assemblage from Tell el-'Or?meIT?l Kinr?t is preferable. Namely, that this phenomenon points to a well organized economic system in which the stamped vessels seemingly played a major role and were part of an administrated distribution of goods54. This is especially true in view of later practices of sealing jars, which clearly reflect a strong socio-economic structure of the participating en tities 55. This conjuncture is also evidenced by a bulla retrieved in topsoil just above Iron Age I settlement layers in Area W (fig. 4; Taf. 8,10)56. Though it would be tempting to view the 50 The well-known inscribed handle from Hirbet Radd?na (Callaway/Cooley 1971, 14-15; cross /Freedman 1971; Aharoni 1971) dates with some likelihood to an earlier period than sug gested by the context it was found in (Lederman 1999, 139 -142) and thus cannot be cited as a valid proof for the existence of inscribed jar handles dating the Iron Age I (Sass 2005, 44-45; see also Finkelstein 2007, 111-112). Similarly, the signs on jar handles from levels 19-17 in grid 38 at Ashkelon/'Asqal?n (Cross / Stager 2006, 134-151) may not in every case represent Cypro-Minoan script, but could also be interpreted as generic potter's marks, as not even ruled out by Cross and Stager (ibidem 145; see also Maeir/Wimmer/Zukerman/Demsky 2008, 54 n. 24 and on - a more generic level - Hirschfeld 2002, especially 92-99). 51 Only at Tell el-cUm?r?iwo rectangular impressions on handles show an identical motif; cf. Eggler/ Keel 2006, Tall al-cUmeiri nos. 57 and 64; cf. also ibidem no. 37. 52Cf., e.g., Wood 1990, 45-48; London 1991, 397-403; Shoham 2000, 109-110; Hirschfeld 2008. 53 See, e. g., examples in Millard 2005. 54 Similarly Ben-Shlomo 2006, 148 for Early Iron Age Ekron/Hirbet el-Muqanna(; see also the peculiar anepigraphic sealings on handles of "hippo"-jars from Tel Reh?v/Tell es-S?rem and Beth Shean/7W/ el-Hisn dating to the Early Iron Age IIA, which might point to a local administrative system (Keel/Mazar 2009, 63*-64* with figs. 3-4), as well as Greenberg/Cinamon 2006 for the case of the Nahal Refa'?m basin west of Jerusalem in the Middle and Late Iron Ages.

The partial impression shows traces of a bird62 with raised wings facing to the right that is similar to items, e.g., from (*)Gezer/Tell el-Gazari, *Megiddo/7H/ el-Mutesellim or - though later in date - * Ugarit63. Horizontal lines fill the space above it. They may well be the remnants of an original tree. Therefore, the iconography of impression no.

The set of motives, the seal shape and engraving style all point to an Early Iron Age date of the item. The bulla from Tell el- 'Oreme/Tel Kinr?t is a welcome addition to the marginal corpus of bullae and other sealings dating to this period deriving from secure Iron Age I contexts 65. Within the Philistine realm they are most prominently reported from Ekron/Hirbet el-Muqannac (Strata VB-IVA)66, but were also found at other Philistine sites like hsh?o??Esd?d (Strata XII-XI)67, (*)Ashkelon/fA^a/?n68 and Tel B?t?s/Tell el-Bat?s?

Dr. Angela von den Driesch (Munich) suspects them to be cranes (personal communication). 63Macalister 1912 III: pi. 202a,15 (two birds flanking a human figure); Loud 1948, pi. 153,238 (bird confronting a quadruped); nunn 1999, no. 304 (bird accompanied by a star). 64 Keel 1980, 264-266, no. 8 and fig. 72.

The bullae mentioned by Keel from Tell Gemme and Tell el-Far'a (South) as being of an Iron Age I-IIA origin, most likely derive from an Iron Age IIA context (Dr. Gus van Beek [personal communication! and Laemmel 2003 [I], 37); similarly, the items from Tell el-Hamme come from an Iron Age IIA context as already stated by the excavators, cf. Cahill/ Lipton/Tarler 1987, 282 and 1988, 193; the three bullae from Lachish/7W/ ed-Duw?r are either surface finds or derive from an Iron Age IIB context (cf. Tufnell 1953, 373 with further explana tions on p. 25). Thus, the only in situ Iron Age I bullae mentioned by Keel (ibidem) are the items from Tell K?s?n mentioned in footnote 73 below. - Not chronologically attributable bullae and sealings are (s|!)Aphek/7W/ R?s el- , Keel 1997, Afek no. 3 (clay sealing with impression of 19th/early 20th dynasty seal) and no. 16 (sealing/bulla with two impressions of a late 12th/13th dynasty seal); ^Tell ezer, Fourth Semitic Period: Macalister 1912 III, pi. 191,19-20 (clay sealing and sealed stopper with geometric impressions deriving from rectangular seals similar in style to some of the so-called 'Philistine Anchor Seals', cf. Keel 1994b, nos. 1-3.7). - Omitted from the following list are two yet unpublished items, i. e. a seal impression on a stopper from Tell Gezer and another impression on a clay sealing from Tell es-S?fi (personal communication Dr. Samuel Wolff [Israel Antiquites Authority] and Prof. Aren M. Maeir [Bar Ilan University], respectively). 66Ben-Shlomo 2006, 138-140 with Table 1 (nos. 21, 23-24, 27) and figs. 1-4. 67 Doth an/Por ath 1993, 83 with fig. 38,2 and pi. 48,1 and Brandl 1993a, 130-131 no. 2.

Two further bullae found at sites in the Jordan Rift Valley are known. They come from Beth Shean/7^// el-Hisn14 and Tell es-Sac?d?ye15. In view of the distribution pattern of bullae and other sealings found in Early Iron Age contexts in the southern Levant (fig. 5), it is worthy of note that this practice was seemingly limited to the coastal areas or to sites in the Jordan Rift Valley with a material culture that was still heavily influenced by the former Egyptian hegemony. As the latter is barely in the case for Kinneret76, the use of mud sealings might have been introduced to the city's economy along with the intense contacts of the city with the Phoenician ports on the Mediterranean coast77. Furthermore, Tell el-cOr?meIT?l Kinr?t seems to be the only site in Cis- and Transjordan, where the use of mud sealings and the practice of stamping jar handles were performed side by side. The local economy was thus integrating two traditions that were mutually exclusive in the norm. 70 MacDonald/ Starkey /Harding 1932, pl. 61,5-6 (two oval impressions on clay stoppers - most certainly belonging to wine jars - found in the so-called residency). The impressions show a deity standing on a lion; for the motif cf. cornelius 1994, 195-208; on the practice of sealing wine jars with the vintner's seal during the New Kingdom in Egypt, cf. Wood 1987; see also Keel 1995, ?317. - Note that in the same building a jar fragment bearing the name of Setos II (1200/1199 ? 1194/93 b.c.e.) was retrieved (Macdonald/Starkey/Harding 1932, pi. 61,1 and pi. 64,74) - yet another indication for this building's administrative character; cf. Braunstein 1998, 127-128.131; Laemmel 2003, 38-39. 71 Dever (ed.) 1986, pl. 55,15 (oval impression on a clay lump with indistinct hieroglyphs dating to the MBIIB/C period; the motif is comparable, e.g., to a surface find from Aphek/7e// Ras el- , cf. Keel 1997, Afek no. 93). Note that the field reading of the respective Locus 23036 attributed to Stratum 6C/B was "LB II, 12th cent. B.C.". In the overall stratigraphy, however, Stratum 6C/B is equivalent to the first Philistine Stratum XIII (Dever [ed.] 1986, 8-9 fig. 2). 72 Stern 2000, 360-363 with fig. 264 (several bullae impressed by the same Middle Bronze Age scarab that were originally sealing linen sacks filled with 'Hacksilber'). 73 Oval impressions on two bullae seemingly deriving from the same seal and showing a four-leafed rosette with intersecting uraei. Additionally, a rectangular impression on a third bulla displaying a lion trampling above a human figure stretched on the ground and a fourth bulla with an impression of an oval seal showing Baal-Seth and Reshef standing on a lion and a gazelle, respectively (Keel 1980, nos. 28-31) were found. All four bullae originally sealed bags containing metal and were found in a single Phoenician Bichrome jar (cf. N det 1980, 325). 74 Oval impression on jar sealing (?) displaying an ibex to the left and a scorpion (Lower Level V; Rowe 1940, pi. 39,14 = James 1966, fig. 108,5; for the motif which dates to the late Iron Age IB and the Iron Age IIA, cf. Keel/Uehlinger 1998, ?93). The context is somewhat enigmatic (see also Mazar in Panitz-Cohen /Mazar (ed.) 2006, 34-35). - Note, e. g., that a bowl originating from the same locus like the sealing discussed here was - though red-slipped and burnished - incorporated by James 1966, fig. 59,11 to the 'Lower Level V type series. Consequently, the locus is also marked on the plan of the southeastern quadrant in James 1966, Fig 74. Thus this find might be viewed as chronologically insecure. 15 Round impression ( 12 mm) showing a cross motif typical of the Early Iron Age similar to a seal impression on a handle from DTb?n above, cf. footnote 42 (Stratum XII; Eggler/Keel 2006, Tall as-Sacidiya no. 40). 76 Apart from an Egyptian dbn-weight ( Fritz /Munger 2002, 19 with fig. 10,4), the attested consump tion of Nile perch (Lates niloticus; Manhart/von den Driesch 2004, 182 with Table 15) and a handful of seals imported from Egypt (monger 2007b, passim), no further contacts with Egypt can be extrapolated from the material culture of the Early Iron Age remains at present. 77 Such economic ties can be exemplified, e.g., by the high amount of small Phoenician ceramic containers (Pakk ala/ Munger /Zangenberg 2004, 20-22 with fig. 11) found within the Early Iron Age settlement layers.

Summary Such a large and homogeneous corpus of stamp-seal impressions on jar handles like the lot presented here from Tell el-'Or?meITel Kinr?t was hitherto unknown in the material culture of Early Iron Age southern Levant. It provides minute indications of economic and/or ad ministrative processes within the ancient city (and possibly its trading area) that were previ ously only known from later times. The iconography of the set of motifs showing Egyptian and Syrian influences, that was used to seal containers, is indicative of the socio-economic character of ancient Kinneret, whose find assemblage reflects a variety of different cultural impacts78. Especially the group of sealed jar handles depicting the (Egypto-)Syrian deity Reshef further adds to our knowledge of the religious background (and cultural origin?79) of the city's ancient inhabitants80. The bulla - a unique find at sites where stamped jar handles are the rule - is again another evidence for the diverse and multilayered traditions that shaped the administrative, economic and religious life of the ancient city and corroborates previous statements that Early Iron Age Kinneret was a highly organized settlement at the dawn of the first millennium B.C.E.81.
