Pp. 228 (Geoffrey Chapman, I97I.) f2.50 These two works on Indian philosophy appear in the publisher's series 'Indian Religions and Philosophies'. If, as it would appear, they are the first two numbers, they augur well for future volumes in this series. Patterns of Indian Thought is sub-titled 'A student's Introduction', though it would require an advanced student to follow Father Chethimattam's close reasoning in the first I20 pages of this work. In contrast to this carefully documented treatment of Hinduism and Islam, Sikhism and Christianity are dismissed in a mere thirty pages and quoted largely from secondary sources. It might have been better to have limited the book to Hindu thought, in which field the author shows considerable expertise. In place of the summary treatment of the non-Hindu systems, the author could then have included a discussion of the Dravidian religio-cultural tradition, the omission of which he acknowledges with regret in his introduction. Nevertheless, in the I20 pages devoted to Hinduism, the author has given a masterly sketch of Hindu thought, especially in the Rigveda, the Upanishads and the Sutras. The Gita is referred to only incidentally, and there is only the briefest reference to the important bhakti movement. A fuller treatment of both these subjects would have been fitting in a student's introduction. Father Chethimattam's thesis is that India ought to be the starting-point for the reconciliation of the major living world religions, since in that country dialogue among the various cultural traditions and religious systems is 'a historical fact'. The key to this claim (which not all would accept) lies, according to the author, in the dual relationship in Hinduism between the individual person and the Supreme Person, between the many and the One. It is extraordinary that Ramanuja's treatment of this question receives</page><page sequence="2">380 REVIEWS no mention in this book, though this omission is more than made good in the second volume; but that volume is a separate work. For the present, Father Chethimattam is content to refer to hints of something near to theism, especially in the Svetasvatara Upanishad. 'On the one hand, man has to realise that all that is good in him has its ground and source in the Supreme Lord, the Ultimate Atman. On the other, he has to admit the infinite distance between his limited selfhood and the Supreme Self.' But in this volume it is 'the ideal proposed for man to realise the Supreme Atman as his own self' which is chiefly emphasised, especially as this ideal is set forth in the works of Sankara. So 'the Supreme Reality should not be sought outside, as a thing among things, a person among persons'. Again, 'God cannot strictly be placed in an I-Thou relationship with us, since our I-hood itself is only a reflexion of God's supra-personal Reality'. So, at the end of the section on the Hindu tradition, 'this presents a pure concept of God, unaffected by the anthropomorphic qualities with which ordinary theism dresses up its God'. The later Hindu theist's idea of God is said to fall 'far short of the Absolute'. This may be a justifiable criticism of certain types of Hindu theism-akin to twentieth-century criticisms of certain types of Christian theism-but I miss in this book a positive approach to a theism which can truly be called a basis for inter-religious reconciliation. At best it can be said that the author realises the tension between the two points of view, that which emphasises the Absolute Spirit as the Unique Self of all and that which 'places the emphasis on the individuality of the self'. According to Sankara, he says, the realisation of the Divine Self as the self of oneself is known by intuition, anubhava, not by objective understanding of the world of experience, not even by an objective vision of God. 'A god who can be looked at from the outside is no God.' God can be known only through intuitive awareness, a 'becom ing-one-with-him'. But is not this pantheism? Father Chethimattam makes it quite clear in his second book, Consciousness and Reality, that although to know the Real we must become one with the Real, this does not mean that the finite individual is identical with God. The 'oneness' is rather the realisation that the ultimate ground of our reality and selfhood is God. Although in this volume, as in the first, the author speaks frequently with approval of Sankara, it is the personal philosophy of Ramanuja which he finds more satisfying here, as a basis for Hindu-non-Hindu dialogue. His chapters on the two great medieval Hindu thinkers judiciously outline the various points ofagreement and difference between the two systems. Ramanuja he rightly refers to as 'the Synthesizer'. It was Ramanuja who 'strove to see the value of the relative and finite world, of human personality and of religion as-personal devotion to the personal God'. Ramanuja, he says, is not content to say with Sankara 'Brahman alone is real, all other things</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 38I than Him are unreal'. For Ramanuja 'other things', though subordinate to and absolutely dependent upon Brahman are nevertheless real, finding their reality in the personal Lord who is Brahman. Is this synthesis too simple? Is there in fact a real synthesis between pantheism and theism in Ramanuja's thought? I am not sure whether Father Chethimattam really answers this question. Perhaps there is no answer. Perhaps terms like pantheism and theism are unsatisfactory. The apparently irreconcilable opposition between the advaita school of Sankara and the vishishtadvaita teaching of Ramanuja 'is mostly owing to a lack of comprehension of the other side's outlook and presuppositions'. Once these are understood, the author believes, it can be seen that the two positions are not contradictory but are complementary. Ramanuja presents Reality not as attributeless but as real existence, possessing attributes, especially that of personality. Nevertheless, Father Chethimattam admits that since these attributes are said to be eternally existent in Brahman, the accusation of pantheism or panentheism 'seems rather difficult to avoid'. The nearest he comes to such avoidance is in his statement that the end of knowledge is not an 'It' but first an 'I', the One who knows, and then finally the 'Thou', the Supreme Person in whom alone I find my fullness and fulfilment. This is a philosophical and also a religious statement (not easy to reconcile with statements in the first book) which is neither a crude theism nor a vague pantheism. If panentheism seems a more appropriate description (as Bishop John Robinson says in his Exploration into God), why not? The second part of this volume consists of a detailed enquiry into the nature of consciousness, with illuminating observations on such obscure matters as 'the Void' (which is not pure negation but the affirmation that reality does not fit into our mental framework) and into atheism as 'an emphatic affirmation of the ineffable God beyond human conceptions'. In the end, the author recognises that it may not be possible to fuse the two approaches (Hindu and Christian?, pantheistic and theistic?) into one. Fusing them, he says, will destroy their special value. Therefore the best procedure may be to maintain their proper character and keep up the dialogue that makes them complement each other and correct each other's defects. This may well be true. But for how long is the dialogue to go on and what grounds have we for believing it will ultimately reach a synthesis that will not destroy the special value of each? The author doesn't say. Perhaps he is wise. A stimulating pair of books. Not easy reading, but honest and scholarly. HENRY LEFEVER</page></plain_text>
