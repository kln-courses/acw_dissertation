Mainland's Elementary Medical Sta- dent upon the pattern (aggregation) of both the prey and predator, and is increased by the presence of prey refuges. Stability of these model systems is also in- creased when there is mutual interference between searching predators, and when a predator is able to ex- hibit switching (taking a larger proportion of a common prey and a smaller proportion of a rare prey) between two or more potential prey species. These concepts, de- veloped by the author with their underlying mathemati- cal models, and bearing in mind some of the essential differences between predators and parasitoids, are ap- plied to the field of biological control. A few general- isations can be made, e.g. a host-specific parasitoid is likely to be a more efficient control organism than a polyphagous one, or the presence of hyperparasitoids will raise the pest's stable equilibrium density. Such conclusions are relatively mundane, and it is clear that there is still much to understand about the population dynamics of biological control. In the introduction to this review two criteria of the Princeton Series were mentioned: individualism and novelty. This book is certainly individualistic since so much of the work described has been published by the author (the reference section lists 26 papers of which Dr. Hassell is either author or co-author). Despite this individualistic approach, the subject matter of the book is well-balanced, except that population age structure, mentioned in the introductory chapter and the epilogue, is almost forgotten. Hence, this book will undoubtedly form an extremely useful textbook of population dy- namics. The second criterion, novelty, is not attained. The book surveys the subject, being essentially a re- view, and will not be seen to infuse new ideas into the science of ecology in the way that some of the other monographs in the series have done.

There is little in it which is likely to be of great interest to bio- metricians. Indeed, the only contribution with any di- rect bearing on biometry is a short paper using ther- modynamic and chemical analogies to connect speciation and population size in the Volterra model. There are also two articles which explore the uses of in- formation theory in theoretical biology. Apart from these and papers on inductive logic and on search the- ory, most of the contributions are concerned in some way with applications to statistical mechanics. There are two informative survey papers, also with a ther- modynamic flavour, which include some intriguing ap- plications among their references. P. E.

One cannot think of a better choice for the Se- ries' first reprint in biostatistics than Mainland's Ele- mentary Medical Statistics, as this book ranks with Bradford Hill's Principles of Medical Statistics in its in- fluence and impact on clinical research. In Socratic style, it reviews a research project from beginning to end using ten groups of questions. Current investigators brought up on statistical pack- ages and hand-held calculators would benefit by its commonsense approach. Today, we perhaps too readily apply high-powered computer-based procedures instead of thinking our way through the statistical analysis. Your students may find the style wordy. Medical stu- dents who had criticized my teaching as too mathemati- cal were asked to read Mainland and found the text ver- bose! For this reason and because it is out of date, this reprint is best used to supplement more recent develop- ments in statistical analysis. Many of these develop- ments, such as survival analysis,.di.screte multivariate analysis, sequential trials, etc. lie outside the book's scope. If Dr. Mainland could be persuaded to write a third edition he would surely include sections on the mangement of multi-center trials and natural history studies, in addition to rewriting his treatment of exact 2 x 2 tests and confidence limits, omitting the tables in favor of computational algorithms. It is doubtful, however, if anyone, let alone Dr. Main- land, could do this without in effect rewriting the whole book. This reprint is therefore welcome in that everyone should have a copy of Mainland on his shelf to remind him of the fundamentals. S. J.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1979, 352 pp. $20.00 cloth, $7.50 paper. The social insects have fascinated generations of biol- ogists and natural historians, partly because they appear somewhat anthropomorphic (terms like 'queen', 'sol- dier', 'worker', etc. are evidence of this) and partly be- cause the uniting of many individuals into an organic whole (developed to its greatest extent in the almost fic- tional writings of Eugene Morais) has attracted human imagination. With this wealth of uncritical interest in social insects it is extremely pleasant to read a book that critically analyses the evolution and role of eusociality. The book explores the origins of social structures and emphasises the eusociality threshold concept, first pub- lished in 1976 by E. O. Wilson. The eusocial insects ex- hibit three traits: cooperation in caring for the young, a division into reproducing and non-reproducing forms, and an overlap of at least two generations (usually ac- companied by a haploid/diploid reproductive process).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 903 These basic ideas are expanded in the chapters of the book, which look at the life cycle of the colony (not the individual); genetical aspects of selection for eusociality and the existence of thresholds; biological aspects of growth, time-sequencing, etc. in the development of the castes; foraging strategies for the individuals within a colony; the optimization of energy flow through the col- ony into producing new reproductive individuals; and the ratio of the castes one to the other. Throughout the text the treatment of the subject is quantitative, there being 87 diagrams (mostly graphs, very few of insects) and 135 numbered equations (as well as many that are unnumbered). Many postulates of the authors are sup- ported by small models, in a number of instances rather over-simplified, but sometimes leading to rather striking conclusions (as, for example, the small shift needed in behavioural flexibility to change the optimum from monomorphism to polymorphism). A central plank of the authors' theory of the origin of the caste system is optimization theory. A whole chapter is devoted to a critique of this theory, but one remains, perhaps like the authors, uncertain as to what is being optimized. The conclusion of the authors is perhaps much the same as the natural historian: that in the evo- lution of a particular trait some influences are the result of natural selection and other influences are created by stronger selection on other traits. It is clearly in this area that the book is least quantitative, and where a consid- erable amount of work needs to be focussed in the fu- ture. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and found it to be most thought-provoking. I am sure that it will stimulate a greater amount of study, in a more quan- titative way, of the social insects, even if only to answer the questions posed in the short ninth chapter and to add more data about the termites, the 'forgotten' order of social insects.

This book is aptly titled and, as indicated in its pref- ace, its intent is ". . . to serve as a useful adjunct to lec- tures and fuller texts, providing the student with an out- line for revision and the medical research worker with an instructive handbook." There are many formulae in- terspersed with prose. The prose, however, is spare and the text, true to its title, remains more of an outline than a flowing narrative. The statistical novice in the health field, with self-study in this book, would find it ex- tremely difficult to master an adequate understanding. But, in tandem with other texts or with a formal course, the book could be a useful aid as a compact compilation of basic methods, definitions and principles. Thus, the book well achieves its stated objectives. The subject content is standard statistical fare. Fol- lowing a short introduction of mainly definitions and explanation of the summation notation, the book covers dcscriptive statistics, probability, probability distribu- tions, sampling distributions, estimation and confidence interval determination, hypothesis testing, t-tests for comparison of two means, F-tests for comparison of two variances, chi-square for comparison of two propor- tions, regression and correlation and distribution free methods (Wilcoxon's signed rank and rank sum test and Spearman's rank correlation). There are three addi- tional chapters that deal with clinical trials, rates and their standardization (including life table methods) and, finally, computers. For the major portion of the book that deals with basic statistical principles and methods, the outline for- mat works extremely well. Unfortunately, for the latter three chapters, it does not work as well. Rates, comput- ers and particularly clinical trials simply do not lend themselves to the outline format adopted for the book. The presentation here tends to be choppy, disjointed and rather uninformative. Since, however, this portion of the book constitutes less than 15% of the text pages, little is lost. Dr. Petrie has employed what this reviewer regards as standard statistical notation. This is indeed a laudable asset and should make the book compatible with nota- tion in other texts and with notation that most medical statistics instructors would likely employ. An unusual feature of the book is the clumping of worked numerical examples at the end of each chapter. The author's intent was to retain continuity of the text and provide the reader "...easy access to illustrative ma- terial." Since flow and continuity are not important fea- tures with the format of the book, I fail to see what the author has gained by this. As an "instructive hand- book", this clumping at the end of a chapter makes the reader do a bit more page flipping than he might other- wise do. Nonetheless, there is little inconvenience. The examples cited cover a wide range of research areas in medicine. Most examples use real data with ci- tation of the data source. It is puzzling why hypothetical data were employed to illustrate descriptive methods (frequency distribution, mean and standard deviation) and to illustrate the independent samples t-test. Surely, real data could have easily been obtained. Technically, I discovered a number of specific annoyances: In introducing the comparison of two means in inde- pendent samples, the author states, "In practice this is achieved by selecting a sample of individuals and ran- domly assigning one treatment to nl of them and the other treatment to the remaining n2 individuals" (page 70). Surely, in practice, random assignment to groups underlie$ but a small fraction of the tests of significance performed for comparison of two independent means. In fact, much to my surprise, the example the author uses later to illustrate the independent samples t-test in- volves no such randomization. The example concerns comparison of mean age at onset of symptoms of lung cancer in male versus female patients. The four-fold table is illustrated by an association be- tween warts and systemic lupus erythematous in a cross-sectional study. I raised my eyebrows when I found the text referring to the "incidence of warts" es- pecially when, further on (page 155), a clear distinction is made between incidence and prevalence. The author's general approach before applying any analysis is to plot the data and the book is peppered with such simple diagrams (pages 21, 63, 67, 71, 76, 82,</page></plain_text>
