Levine, King H. Yang, and Albert I. King Wayne State Univ. Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The mechanisms of knee fracture were studied experimentally using cadaveric knees and analytically by amputa- simulation. Toi 90 degree flexed knees woe impacted frontally by a 20 kg pendulum with a rigid surface, a 450 psi (3.103 MPa) crudi strength and a 100 psi (0.689 MPa) crush strength aluminum honeycomb padding and a 50 psi (0.345 MPa) crudi strength papo honeycomb padding at a velocity of about five m/s. During rigid surface impact, a patella fracture and a split condylar fracture woe observed. The split condylar fracture was genoated by the patella pushing the condyles apart, based on a finite element model using the maximum principal stress as the injury criterion. In the case of the 450 psi aluminum honeycomb padding, the split condylar fracture still occurred, but no patella fractures woe observed because the honeycomb provided a more uniform distribution of patella load. No bony fractures in the knee area occurred for impacts with a 50 psi papo honeycomb padding. In the four 100 psi aluminum honeycomb tests, thoe woe two split condylar fractures and no bony fractures in the otho two tests. A 3-D finite element human knee model was developed to try to understand the internal stress distribution during knee impacts. The model included a femur, patella, tibia, associated ligaments modeled as bar elements, and a poidulum. The calculated pendulum force for a rigid impact and impacts using the 100 psi and 450 psi honeycomb matched that obtained fron the tests but for the 50 psi honeycomb case, it did not. The calculated stress concentration location in the femur coincided clearly with the fracture location in the rigid impact test. To protect the knee, fiie ultimate crush strength of the honeycomb padding was presumed to be 90 psi (0.620 MPa), based on linear interpolation of this limited series of experiments. INTRODUCTION Automotive fatalities have been greatly reduced since the widespread availability of the airbag supplemental restraint system. In severe crashes, occupants who previously would not have survived without the airbag are now surviving with severe lower extremity injuries. While these injuries are normally not life-threatening, victims go through a long period of rehabilitation and suffer loss of mobility. The study of lower extremity has become an important task in occupant protection. The protection of lower extremities is required by Federal regulation. In FMVSS 208, the femoral axial force of the dummy was raised to 10 kN in 1976 for a 13.4 m/s (30 mph) frontal crash. This limit has reduced the need for padding the dash, rendering it a source for knee injury in high speed crashes. Morgan et al (1991) reported that injury to the thigh has been reduced to around 10%, but knee injury still accounted for 20 to 30% of the lower limb injury. The prevention of knee injury through padding can result in the generating large bending moments in the femoral shaft by pocketing the knee in a thick or soft pad. It is important to study pads which can prevent both the knee and femoral shaft injuries. Powell et al (1974) conducted six rigid pendulum impacts to knees of four embalmed cadavers. In those tests, with a femoral axial force of less than 10 kN, patella or condylar fractures still occurred. Donnelly and Roberts (1987) conducted 18 rigid knee impact tests. The predominant injuries were patella fractures. Most recently, Haut and Atkinson (1995) presented a series of fern crai impacts using un embalm ed cadavers. The predominant injury was also patella fracture. Melvin et al (1975) studied the effect of 25.4 mm thick padding on the femur. A total of 31 tests on 14 cadavers were reported. No Mure was seen for a peak force below 15 kN. All fractures occurred in the supracondylar region and the patella. Viano et al (1978) conducted knee impacts at six m/s with a 57 mm pad. Avulsion fracture of the posterior cruciate ligament was frequently seen with a peak contact force of seven kN. This type of injury was due to initial contact of the impact«· with the tibial tuberosity and could be avoided by increasing the knee flexion angle or by having the dash slope down and away from the knee. No injuries were observed when there was permanent pad 1842</page><page sequence="2">damage. Haut (1989) compared rigid and padded impacts using paired cadaveric specimens. The mean fracture force of the patella or femur was 8.5 kN and 9.5 kN for rigid and padded impacts, respectively. In a rigid impact to the flexed knee, the force is transmitted through the patella to the two femoral condyles as shown in Figure 1. The hypothesis is that the patella splits the condyles apart and causes fracture. When a padded surface impacts the knee, the force is transmitted not only to the patella but also to the condyles (Figure 2). The hypothesis is that a padding of appropriate stiffness can prevent knee fractures as well as femoral shaft fractures (Powel et al, 1974; Melvin et al, 1975; Haut, 1989). In terms of clinical care, fractures of the complex knee joint, such as the patella or condylar fractures, are far more difficult to treat than femoral shaft fractures. The objective of this study was to compare rigid knee impacts with those using padded surfaces for a better understanding of the knee fracture mechanism. Experimental testing of cadaveric knees and computer simulation methods were used. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS All tests were performed m male unembalmed cadaveric specimens. Prior to the experiment, specimens were carefully examined radiologically. The femoral shaft was sectioned approximately 20 mm distal to the lesser trochanter. The femoral shaft was then potted in a cylindrical steel sleeve using a low melting point metal, Ostalloy (Die Supply Co., Warren, MI). The test configuration is shown in Figure 3. The cylinder and the center of the patella were aligned with the pendulum axis. The lower leg was flexed slightly more than 90 degrees to avoid contacting the tibial tuberosity before the patella was impacted. The pendulum was propelled by compressed nitrogen with a target velocity of five m/s. This speed was selected because a bony fracture was anticipated for a rigid impact at this speed. The mass of the pendulum, including the load-cell and padding, was 20 kg. It is equivalent to the sum of the half of the Hybrid ΙΠ dummy's lower torso, the upper leg, and half of the lower leg. The load-cell had a diameter of 152 mm. The same diameter padding was used for padded impacts. Three different padding materials were selected, a 100 psi, a 450 psi (rush strength aluminum honeycomb (HEXEL Corp., Dublin, CA) and a 50 psi (rush strength paper honeycomb (Hexacomb, Matteson, IL). All together, there were one rigid impact, one impact with the 450 psi aluminum honeycomb, four impacts with the 50 psi paper honeycomb, and four impacts with the 100 psi aluminum honeycomb. The load-cell was a 5000-lb capacity uni-axial load-cell mounted on the pendulum. The data were digitized and filtered by a channel class 600 filter as stipulated in SAE Recommended Practice J211. Data from an accelerometer attached to the end of the pendulum were used to provide inoliai compensation to the load-cell data. A six-axis load-cell was mounted against the rigid frame support to measure the medio-lateral bending mement applied to the femoral shaft. EXPERIMENT RESULTS A total of ten impact tests on five pairs of knee specimens was performed. Specimen information and the test matrix are shown in Table 1. For the rigid surface impact (Case 1), the result was a patella fracture and a split condylar fracture as hypothesized (Figure 4). Only a split condylar fracture was seen in the 450 psi aluminum honeycomb test (Case 2). The maximum deformation of the 450 psi aluminum honeycomb was only 7 mm. It was not deep enough for condylar contact and a split condylar fracture resulted. A 450 psi crush strength is apparently too stiff to prevent knee injury. In Cases 3 to 6, 50 psi paper honeycomb was used. The peak force was 6.7 kN for the three-inch paper honeycomb test (Case 4). No condylar or patella fractures were observed . When the honeycomb thickness was reduced to two inches (Case 6), the peak force increased to 9.4 kN. Again, no fractures were observed. Cases 3 and 5 had oblique proximal femur fractures with lower contact force when compared to Cases 4 and 6, respectively. The measured M-L bending moments were also higher in the two non-fracture cases. There were four tests with 100 psi aluminum honeycomb. In the two in which the impact force exceeded 10 kN, split condylar fractures resulted while in the other two at less than 10 kN there were no bony fractures. This result indicates that 100 psi crush strength honeycomb may be near the limit for the prevention split condylar fractures. ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS A 3-D finite element knee model was created to simulate the experiments we performed. The HyperMesh™ and Pam- Crash™ codes were used as the pre-processor and the solver, respectively. The external model geometry is based on data from VIEWPOINT™ fee- a 50th percentile male right leg and the sectional data of the bone were obtained by physical dissections performed at the Bioengineering Center. Skin and muscles were not included since they carry a minor portion of the impact load. Instead, the mass of the leg (6.0 kg for upper-leg and 5.7 kg for lower leg) was distributed to the materials in the model as denser materials. Figure 5 shows the model which consists of a femur, 1843</page><page sequence="3">tibia, patella, associated tendons and ligaments as bar elements, and a pendulum. The pendulum was modeled as a rigid body, with or without honeycomb padding attached to its face. A tie contact interface was used to model the interface between the honeycomb and the pendulum when needed. The slide and void interface definition (Type 36 in Pam-Crash) was used for modeling the contact surfaces between the pendulum (or honeycomb) face and the patella, and between the patella cartilage and the femoral cartilage. The thin cortical bone of the patella was modeled by four- node shell elements while the trabecular bone and cartilage of the patella were built up with solid elements. The femoral subchondral bone under the cartilage was modeled by four-node shell elements. Other cortical bone, trabecular berne, and cartilage were modeled by eight-node solid elements. A highly compressible elastic foam material (Pam-Crash Type 21) was used to model the cartilage to avoid the numerical difficulties expressed by the amputer code as "negative volume detected." The material property of the cartilage was adopted from Repo and Finlay (1977) and is shown in Figure 6. The strength and length of the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament were based on the data from Yang et al (1995) as shown in Table 2. The stiflhess of the patella and quadriceps tendon was selected arbitrarily to constrain the patella during the impact. And the insertion locations of the ligaments were based αϊ a plastic anatonical knee model (Somso-Plast, Germany). Material properties of baie used in the model are listed in Table 3. In order to model the honeycomb padding, crushable form (Pam-Crash material type 41) was used. A 96.8 mm diameter bullet-shaped metal knee was built to calibrate the hoieycomb. Figure 7 shows a comparison of force-time histories between model prediction and test data from impacts against the metal knee for the two different materials, the 450 psi aluminum and 50 psi paper hoieyconb at the stated velocities. A total of five different pendulum impact velocities was used on each material. Simulatiai results matched test data within 5%. The material property of the 100 psi aluminum honeycomb was obtained by an interpolation of the 450 psi and 50 psi hoieyconb data. Figure 8 shows the energy time histoy for the 100 psi aluminum hoieyconb impact using the model. In the explicit finite element solution technique, the total energy must be maintained at a ±10 % level to indicate a good simulation. The calculated pendulum force for four different surface conditions is conpared with experimental data in Figures 8 to 1 1 . Since the knee model cannot predict bony fracture, the simulation curves are not in agreement with experimental data when there is fracture and after the peak force has been reached. However, there is good correlatioi before the peak force for the 100 psi aluminum honeycomb when no bony fracture occurred. On the other hand, the computed force for paper honeycomb on the pendulum fece showed a sharp increase at 12 ms after impact because the simulated padding bottomed out. However, this increase in force was not observed experimentally. The reasoi for this difference can be deduced fron the feet that the size of the computer model leg is much smaller than that of the specimen. The smaller contact area in the model, between the leg and the padding, resulted in a smaller contact pressure which caused the model padding to bottom out even though the total force before it bottomed out is less than that measured experimentally. Figure 13 is a posteria· view of the maximum principal stress contour of the femoral shaft for a rigid impact force of 9 kN (2.2 ms) which is selected for comparison with the 100 psi hoieyconb impact at the same peak force. The computed maximum tensile stress concentratioi of 93 MPa at the intercondylar region is consistent with the experimental result of intercondylar fracture and exceeds the ultimate tensile stress of the cotical bone cited in Yamada (1970). Figure 14 shows the contact forces generated by the rigid pendulum against the patella and the femoral condyles. It can be seen that at 2.2 ms (9 kN contact force), there is no pendulum contact with the femoral condyles. In the rigid impact experiment, the knee fractured at approximately 4 ms after the impact. Hence, there was no contact between the pendulum and condyles as shown in the sectional view (Figure 17a). This indicates that the force is transmitted only through the patella, and not the coidyles. The maximum principal stress coitour in the femoral shaft at 9 kN impact force (12 ms after impact) for the 100 psi paper hoieyconb impact is shown in Figure 15. The stress is more evenly distributed throughout the entire shaft and the maximum stress in the intercondylar region is 108 Mpa which is in the same range as the ultimate tensile of femoral cotical bone reported by Yamada (1970). The impact force is being transmitted no oily through the patella but also through the coidyles, as shown in Figures 16 and 17b. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Patella fracture was observed during a rigid impact test This experiment was not repeated because most bony fractures due to rigid impacts were predominantly patella fractures (Haut and Atkinson, 1995). When a rigid surface impacts the patella, the force was applied to a small area, generating high stress which was also calculated in the simulation model also. On the other hand, with honeyconb impact, the contact stress was dramatically reduced in the model and there was no experimental evidence of patella fracture. Hence, the patella can be protected by disfributing the impact force with padding. 1844</page><page sequence="4">Condylar fracture was found in impacts involving the use of both the 450 psi and 100 psi honeycomb. Split condylar fractures were induced by the patella splitting the condyles apart. Therefore, this fracture seems to depend m the magnitude of the patella force. Haut and Atkinson (1995) found the split condylar fractures occurred at a peak force of 6.1 kN for a rigid impact. If we assume that the applied force of 6 kN on a patella is the threshold for split condylar fracture, the maximum crush strength if the honeycomb that can be used to prevent fracture, can be estimated from the computed forces m patella. They were 3.5 kN and 6.7 kN for the 50 psi honeycomb and the 100 psi honeycomb respectively. By linear interpolation, the maximum honeycomb crush strength would be 90 psi. The average distance from the anterior patella surface to the head of femoral condyles was 19.0 mm in the specimens used. Any material designed to protect the knee should be able to deform at least this amount in order to produce a beneficial effect. Otherwise, a split condylar fracture can be induced. The honeycombs used were not pre-crushed. In a pendulum test against a metal knee, it was found that there was no sharp increase in the measured force-time history (Figure 7). Honeycombs need to be pre-crushed in the event that the contacting surface is about the same size as the honeycomb surface. In this experiment, the patella was much smaller than the 152 mm diameter of the honeycomb. Pre-crushing of the honeycomb was not done to provide a better measure of the deformation of the honeycomb. The measured M-L bending moment is not a good predictor of proximal femur fractures (Cases 3-6). The balding moments of the other two axes, not measured in this study, were needed in the friture study. The model can be criticized for attaching the mass of soft tissues to the bony structure by increasing its density. In real life, the soft tissues are loosely coupled with the bone. In the analytical model, it was assumed to be part of the bone. Because the inertial properties are the same in both cases, it was assumed that the model can predict the dynamic responses properly. The material properties choosen could significantly alta the stress outcome. A study by Li a al. concluded that the modulus of the cartilage was about 2 MPa, significantly lower than the present study (Li, et al., 1985). Also, for subchondral bone, Mente and Lewis used a much smaller value than this study (Mente and Lewis, 1994). A parametric study is needed to study the effect of different cartilage and subchondral bone material properties. Based on this experimental and analytical study, we conclude that: 1. Patella and femoral condylar split fractures can result from a rigid impact 2. With a 450 psi aluminum honeycomb padding, there was a condylar split fracture, but no patella fracture. 3Using a 50 psi paper honeycomb padding, there was no apparent bony fracture in the knee area. 4. With a 100 psi aluminum honeycomb padding, split condylar fractures occurred in two of the four tests. 5. A finite element model simulating human knee impact by a rigid and a padded pendulum was developed. 6. The calculated pendulum force for rigid and aluminum honeycomb (100 psi and 450 psi crush strength) impacts matched the experimental results. Because of a difference in leg size, the force for the 50 psi honeycomb was not well correlated. 7. The calculated stress concentration location in the femur coincided clearly with the fracture location in the rigid impact test. 8. The crush stroigth of the honeycomb needed to prevent knee injury was estimated to be 90 psi, based on this limited series of experimental study. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We wish to thank Craig D.
