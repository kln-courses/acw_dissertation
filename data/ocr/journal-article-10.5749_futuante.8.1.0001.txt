Kahn,3 had already been discussed by  American scholars such as Stanford Anderson, Joan Ockman,  Eric Mumford, and Sarah Williams Goldhagen.4 The signifi- cance of the debate was seen by these authors as an attempt  to adjust the program and aesthetics of modernism to the new  realities of postwar economy and society. It is lesser known  that Giedion’s conception of a new monumentality absorbed  arguments of his Swiss fellow countryman, the architect, art  historian, and critic Peter Meyer (1894–1984), who addressed  this issue from 1937 on—the year when Mumford’s essay was  published in the anthology CIRCLE: International Survey of  Constructive Art. Ironically, Giedion and Meyer represented  positions that were diametrically opposed in the 1930s. Under- standing the Swiss debate and Meyer’s notion of a contempo- rary monumentality is necessary to fully grasp the significance  and the arguments of the American discussion about new  monumentality.  Swiss architecture, generally associated with pragma- tism, simplicity of form, and carefully designed and precisely  executed details, avoided grand gestures. The cities of this  small country, with an emphasis on its republican tradition and  local government, lacked the representative public squares,  grand avenues, and monuments familiar from the urban  centers of countries with a monarchic past, such as France or  Austria. Therefore, one would think that the Swiss debate on  monumentality in the 1930s was a critique of monumental  forms in architecture. But in reality, it was a far more complex  discussion about monumentality, orchestrated almost single-  handedly by Peter Meyer. It is important to understand why this  heated theoretical debate happened in Switzerland, which, as  a Protestant country, generally shunned monumental build- ings, especially at a time when the rise of Nazism, Fascism, and  Communism in Europe was spawning new forms of monumen- tal architecture. Future Anterior Volume VIII, Number 1  Peter Meyer, a relatively unknown figure outside of Switzer- Summer 2011 land, was an influential and critical thinker who  challenged  1 </page> <page sequence="3"> the ideas of many of his better- known contemporaries and  whose writings attracted the attention of a large audience, both  within and beyond academia and the architectural profes- sion. He studied architecture in Munich under Theodor Fischer  (1862–1938), whose built and written work he admired, and  remained in correspondence with him long after he left Munich  and settled in Zurich. His small 1927 book, Moderne Archi tektur  und Tradition (Modern architecture and tradition) (Figure 1),  summarized what would become his life- long endeavor to  reconcile the modernist program of the Neues Bauen with  traditional architectural forms. He criticized the masters of  the modern movement, pointing out discrepancies between  their renunciation of style and their obvious attempts to codify  a formal vocabulary. What modern architecture needed was  to renounce formalism, he thought. But instead, the formal  principles of functionalism were being canonized as the “new  building style” (Der Sieg des neuen Baustils), to cite the title of  Walter Curt Behrendt’s book.5  Moderne Architektur und Tradition presented collage-  like plates of various contemporary stylistic tendencies, with  ironic comments that both rejected neoclassicism as unable to  express the unpretentious spirit of the time and disallowed the  modern movement as formalism. He derided significant Swiss  buildings, such as the Federal Assembly Building in Berne by  Hans Wilhelm Auer (1894–1902) (Figure 2), for embodying a  false monumental pathos. The word pathos is common cur- rency in German, and was frequently used by Meyer. It comes  from the Greek α ́θος and signifies a theatrical, exaggerated,  emotionally charged expression. Meyer contrasted the formal- ist modernism of Ernst May (1886–1970), Robert Mallet- Stevens  (1886–1945), Le Corbusier (1887–1965), and Walter Gropius  (1883–1969), which he saw as deviating into the realm of the  decorative, with modern buildings derived from English country  houses such as those by the California architect G. W. [George  Washington] Smith (1876–1930); the German, Karl Schneider  (1892–1945); and the Swiss, Max Ernst Haefeli (1901–76) and  Paul Artaria (1892–1959). In the next year, Meyer published  Moderne Schweizer Architektur (Modern Swiss architecture).  In this book he presented more examples, using the arguments  of the previous book, while emphasizing that the architects he  was supporting—like Haefeli or Artaria—did not regard mod- ern architecture as a style.  In 1930 Meyer was appointed editor in chief of Das Werk,  the journal of the Swiss Werkbund and the Association of Swiss  Architects.6 In his first editorial, he rejected what he called  “the foolish delight in pitting the faded slogans ‘modernity’  and ‘conservativism’ against each other over and over again.”7  In subsequent editorials he continued to present a vision of  2 </page> <page sequence="4"> 2. Monumentalbauten (Monumental buildings). Page in Peter Meyer’s book Moderne Architektur und Tradition. </page> <page sequence="5">  modern architecture that, while insisting that modernism was  not a style, reconciled neohistoricist styles and the new anti- historicist modern styles being built in Sweden and Denmark.  Scandinavia was important to Meyer because it was the  place where the notion of the “new monumentality” first  emerged after World War I.8 The intellectual roots of this con- cept can be traced back to the Scandinavian reception of antiq- uity during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which was  later influenced by the renewed German interest in the classical  tradition through the work of Peter Behrens (1868–1940) and  Theodor Fischer (1862–1938). The best-k nown Scandinavian  protagonists of this direction, also known as “new empiricism”  or “Swedish grace,” were Gunnar Asplund (1885–1940) and  Sigurd Lewerentz (1885–1975). Gregor Paulsson (1889–1977),  the Swedish art and architectural critic—five years older than  Meyer and a leading figure in developing the Scandinavian  discourse on monumentality—was similarly inspired by the  success of the Werkbund in Germany. His 1920 book Den ny  arkitektur (The new architecture),9 compared the by- now-  familiar images of grain elevators to Josef Hoffmann’s classi- cal Austrian pavilion of the Werkbund exhibition in Cologne  (1914) and new Danish projects by Kay Fisker and Ivar Bentsen.  He discussed the renewed interest in classical forms as new  monumentality, a new approach based on the continuation  of classical typologies that he traced back to Alfred Messel’s  attempts to adapt existing typologies to new functions, such as  with his Wertheim department store in Berlin (1896–1906). As  director of the Swedish Society of Industrial Design, Paulsson  played a significant role in the important Stockholm Exhibition  of 1930, where he successfully integrated modern design and  advanced technology with a colorful, light, and elegant appear- ance. The Stockholm Exhibition became an important model  for Swiss architecture and urban design, influencing also the  Swiss National Exhibition in 1939 in Zurich.  Paulsson’s book and the Scandinavian buildings by  Asplund and Lewerentz began to change Meyer’s views on  monumental architecture. Up until that time, he had regarded  monumentality as a hollow convention, not a vital need. He be- lieved there were no architects in Switzerland willing to design  monumental architecture and no clients willing to pay for it.10  He criticized the results of the League of Nations competition  in Geneva and rejected the Stuttgart railway station by Paul  Bonatz (1877–1956), a highly successful building acclaimed  by German architectural critics and the general public as the  outstanding example of twentieth-c entury monumentalism.  But, shortly after Meyer took over the journal Das Werk, he  started to modify his earlier position. He wrote his influential  article “Monumental Architecture?” on the occasion of the 1937  4 </page> <page sequence="6">  archi tectural competition for a new congress center and con- cert hall in Zurich.11 He thought that the “architectural misery”  of his time was rooted in the problem that architects had lost  the instinct to recognize when monumental form was required  and when it was unnecessary.12 The “solemn tone of sublime  monumentality,” characteristic of religious buildings and  preserved in their sacredness, has an inflationary effect when  applied to banal everyday buildings. Even such “Babylonic  climaxes of formal pathos”13 as the Palace of Justice in Brussels  (Joseph Poelaert, architect, 1866–83) or the already mentioned  Federal Assembly Building in Berne were devaluated by preten- tious hotels, department stores, and parvenu villas. Earlier in  his career, Meyer had believed that everyday buildings would  be designed more appropriately by following the model of  the English country house. But he later admitted that such a  residential model could not possibly serve as the basis for new  forms when monumentality was required and appropriate,  especially when the client was the state. He stressed that the theory of modern architecture has a gap here, but it  avoided an explanation thinking that if we keep silent on  the question of monumentality, as if it did not exist, it will  be solved by itself. This was the expression of a danger- ous haughtiness: as if the architect would be in position  to decide freely about the legitimacy of a problem he is  faced with, when in fact his social task is that of the prac- titioner, of the executor of collective will and taste. All this  has resulted in the situation where the construction of  monumental buildings has never ceased, but these monu- mental buildings are emerging outside of modern architec- ture: like in Italy, Germany, or Russia, or in the case of the  unfortunate art museum in Basel. Instead of developing  an organic modern monumentality, the whole area of the  monumental has been left as fallow ground, and today  the embarrassment is obvious, as the results of the Zurich  competition demonstrate.14  Meyer was critical of the winning entry to the Zurich  Congress Hall competition by M. E. Haefeli, W. Moser, and  R.  Steiger (Figure 3).15 He preferred the contribution of Karl   Egender, which he identified with a monumentality that  was justified because it felt modern; it looked forward “but  backward as well, this is of great importance, because monu- mentality claims a place on a scale of values, on a comparative  sequence, that reaches back into the past. Monumentality  always strives for eternity, permanence; it is not by coinci- dence that the word ‘monumentum’ comes from ‘monere’ =   reminding.”16 5 </page> <page sequence="7"> 3.

For the  Congress Hall competition, 1937.  Façade to the lake (Das Werk, 1937). American reader, “historical monument,” “national monu- ment” (protected landscapes under federal jurisdiction), and  monumentality are all connected etymologically. In German,  a “Denkmal” (monument) is not necessarily “monumental”;  a nonmonumental monument sounds only paradoxical in  English translation. Not one of Meyer’s several hundreds of  texts, listed in the excellent monograph of Katharina Medici-  Mall on Meyer,17 is dedicated to issues of preservation, which  is not as strange as it might appear. Like in the later American  debate on new monumentality, the adjective “new” was just  as important as monumentality, since it was not about com- memoration but about a form that was able to structure its  environment, a role that could not be filled by the “intentional  monuments” of the past anymore. As the Austrian writer  Robert Musil (1880–1942) noted in his witty essay “Denkmale”  (Monuments), the most noticeable thing about historic monu- ments is that they are not noticed anymore—they are almost  sealed against attention.18 To fix a commemorative stone on  the monument of a person is the best way to sink him into  a sea of oblivion, wrote Musil, and this was very likely also  Meyer’s opinion. New monumentality had an entirely different  purpose. A building that makes monumental claims should  stand out from the rest, both visually and in terms of its mean- ing, stressed Meyer. The “artistically gifted modernity”19 of  Le Corbusier or the  Egender competition entry had their own  charm as joyful, floating expressions, unburdened by the past.  They were improvised, exhibition- like, festive decorations  that would soon disappear. If they did remain standing for too  long, they would strike us as tedious precisely because of their  exaggerated modernity. Such buildings do not make claims  on historical permanence, thought Meyer; they stood for the  “sublimated essence of modernity,”20 without the substance of  the culture that carried them. By contrast, monumental build- ings stemmed from this particular cultural substance. This was  the reason why monumental intentions inevitably led European  architects toward architectural forms stemming from antiquity,  6 </page> <page sequence="8"> “carriers of the monumental side of European culture since  two t housand years.”21  Meyer compared monumental form with typography. The  printed text was able to express the finest nuances of moder- nity, but the use of newly invented characters would make the  text unreadable: There are no other choices: we will either slide back to re- signed, passive, more-o r-l ess tasteful stylistic imitations,  as we witness them today in Germany or Russia. . . . Or we  will opt for an energetic, fundamentally new and unbiased  use of monumental forms, to make them serve the modern  feeling of life and carry a specifically modern monumental- ity, a direction advanced by the valuable contributions of  the Perret brothers and Swedish architects. Only in this  second direction of an active process can we clearly distin- guish between the new monumentality and the conscious  and deliberate non- monumentality. . . .22  The nature of monumentality in modern architecture  seemed like a burning question in 1937, the year of the Paris  World’s Fair. The French magazine L’Illustration featured the  illuminated pavilions of two dictatorships, Hitler’s Germany  and Stalin’s Soviet Union. Meyer described these two pavilions  with sarcasm, rejecting the first for its naïve mediocrity, and  the second for expressing an empty and antiquated pathos  (Figure 4–5). Later, Giedion would also describe these two  buildings as examples of pseudomonumentality, framing the  Eiffel Tower, which was partly covered by what he considered a  more adequate example of contemporary monumentality: the  colorful fireworks at the 1937 Paris exhibition and at the 1939  World’s Fair in New York.23  Other important new ideas about monumentality appeared  that same year. Leslie Martin, Ben Nicholson, and Naum  Gabo published the anthology CIRCLE: International Survey  of Constructive Art,24 featuring rich illustrative material along  with programmatic texts by European and American artists and  critics of the avant-g arde. In his introduction, Gabo describes  art and science as separate paths to knowledge. It is the “con- structive idea” that expects art to perform positive work rather  than keeping a critical distance. Constructive art is a way out  of previous empty formalisms, which had been based only on  artistic considerations. The concluding text in the anthology  was Lewis Mumford’s essay “The Death of the Monument,” an  excerpt from his upcoming book, The Culture of Cities, to be  published the next year. Like Sullivan and Wright before him,  Mumford found in “germ plasm and in social heritage” the  energy that is the basis of organic evolution, in contrast to the  7 </page> <page sequence="9"> 4, 5. The Russian and the German pavilions of the Paris World Fair, 1937. Double spread in Das Werk. </page> <page sequence="10">  </page> <page sequence="11"> “hollow monuments” of the past, such as the Victor Emmanuel  Monument in Rome by Giuseppe Sacconi (1885–1911), or the  New York Public Library by Carrère and Hastings (1897–1911).  Monumentality contradicted the modern principles of flexibility  and adaptation: in ancient Rome, roads, water pipes, and sew- ers were monumental but “the more the energies of a commu- nity become immobilized in such material structures, the less  is it ready to adjust itself to new emergencies.”25 Therefore his  much- quoted conclusion: “The notion of a modern monument  is veritably a contradiction in terms, if it is a monument it is not  modern, and if it is modern, it cannot be a monument.”26  Mumford’s theory of culture assigned a vital role to sym- bolic forms in the renewal of community life. However, he  saw a discrepancy between the advanced design of technical  equipment and the more “backward” aesthetics of architec- ture, which made him regard the functionalism of Le Corbusier  and Gropius with growing skepticism. Mumford’s critique of  architectural monumentality was counterbalanced by other  voices in the CIRCLE anthology. Le Corbusier’s “The Quarrel  with Realism” argued that a new monumentality would emerge  from architects working with sculptors and painters and paying  closer attention to real phenomena as opposed to abstrac- tions. Following Wilhelm Worringer’s distinction between  abstraction and empathy, Le Corbusier described French art  as the most realistic for being empathy-b ased, and therefore  better suited for the development of a new monumentality  internationally: “At the basis of international production is  French art, which, abstract in name, is really concrete. It is es- sentially concrete. It contains realism. [. . .] Perhaps the Nordic  race—the Anglo- Saxons or the Germanic peoples—allowed  themselves to indulge in abstractions.”27 Quoting Léger, he  emphasized the value of monumentality in the much- awaited  synthesis of the arts: “In the collaboration [. . .] mural paint- ing and sculpture with the architecture, restraint is necessary,  special qualities of monumentalism and careful preparation.”28  Mumford greatly influenced Meyer’s thinking on monu- mentality. He reviewed the German edition of Sticks and  Stones in 1926, agreeing with Mumford’s double criticism of  the backward- looking neoclassicism and the forward- looking  machine aesthetic, and extending that criticism to reject the  historicism that undergirded Russian Socialist realism and  German National Socialism, as well as to disallow the rational- ist modern style embraced by Italian Fascism.29 In an important  departure from his previous blanket opposition to monumental  architecture, he suggested that modern architects could begin  to explore a new monumentality so long as they reserved it for  particularly significant public building programs. The emblem- atic type of program he had in mind as sparking the search for  10 </page> <page sequence="12"> 6. Swiss National Exhibition this new monumentality was the 1939 Swiss National Exhibition  (Schweizerische Landesausstellung) (Schweizerische Landesausstellung) in Zurich: “The buildings of  1939 in Zurich, area on the left shore of  Zurich Lake (Das Werk, 1939). the National Exhibition make an important contribution exactly  to the dominant problem of monumentality,” he concluded.30  Meyer was involved in the debates surrounding the plan- ning of the exhibition. Early on, he had argued for siting the  exhibition on the shores of Zurich Lake because the narrow  strip of land along the lake would prevent monumental axial  compositions (Figure 6). Meyer was convinced that to properly  express the republican traditions of Switzerland a less formal  layout was required, without the symmetry, axiality, and grand  gestures of entrance pavilions common in exhibition architec- ture. Still, exhibition director Armin Meili and his chief architect  Hans Hofmann (1897–1956) preferred a conservative image:  the architecture of the village was a model for some of the new  pavilions; others were built as light constructions of wood or  metal. Le Corbusier was not invited to participate.  Meyer praised the final design as a great success, al- though he criticized some details, such as the entrance gate  designed by Hans Leuzinger, because he felt it was inappropri- ate for an entrance to a subdivision “to claim the pathos of  a main gate”31 (Figure 7). Meyer thought a more appropriate  11 </page> <page sequence="13"> 7.

Meyer also praised the light,  almost improvised appearance of the “flag street,” which was  covered by hundreds of flags emblazoned with the coats of  arms of the Swiss towns (Figure 9). He summarized the “sty- listic criteria of modernity” of the exhibition buildings as open  spaces, floated ceilings, bodiless (slender) supports, trans- parence, and structured surfaces (lattices, geometric patterns,  etc.).34  Reassured by the popular success of the Landi, as the  exhibition was popularly called, Meyer developed his posi- tion on monumentality further, focusing on the issue of  adequately representing the idea of the state, a central theme  of the National Exhibition. The Swedish architecture magazine  Byggmästaren devoted a special issue to the theme of monu- mentality. The Swedish architect and urban designer Gunnar  13 </page> <page sequence="15"> 9. The “flag street” of the Swiss National Sundbärg took Peter Meyer’s position as an opportunity to  Exhibition, 1939 (Das Werk, 1939). reflect critically on the issue and rejected the use of the forms  of Greek classical architecture because of the acceptance of  slavery in Greek antiquity. Meyer’s response, entitled “Discus- sion on Monumentality” (Diskussion über Monumentalität),  considered the architectural implications of “state pathos.”  The citizens, he wrote, perceived the state as a metaphysical  entity, a symbol that made the citizens aware of the idea of  unity in a spontaneous and unreflective way, even if this was  neither intended nor desirable. This perception of the state  was not necessarily based on its power but rather on cultural  differences with neighboring states, a common language, the  common cultural origins, geographical location, religion, and  so forth.35 Therefore, he argued that it was not necessary to  14 </page> <page sequence="16"> express the state’s emotional pathos through architectural  gestures suggestive of contrition, intimidation, or other formal  expressions of brutality. On the contrary, it could be expressed  through uplifting and festive forms, generating a feeling of col- lectiveness. Sundbärg suggested a distinction between state  pathos and popular pathos (Volkspathos), a separation that  Meyer did not consider necessary. He also rejected Sundbärg’s  view that modern bridges, stadia, and other public works of  engineering and mass spectacle were the best suited for the  new monumentality. Certainly, these were great achievements,  but Meyer felt they were profane building programs, and he  considered it a grave error to consider them worthy of monu- mental expression.  As World War II raged in Europe, Meyer’s earlier opposition  to classicism weakened. “For monumental architecture,” he  wrote in 1940, “a new classicism will establish itself, not out of  resignation, but through the recognition that only the classical  family of forms with its unlimited capacity for nuances is able  to express the tonality of the sublime and festive in a European  way.” Meyer, who always criticized political or aesthetic ex- tremes in favor of a nuanced position, drew parallels between  European classicism and Japanese traditional architecture  because both could use the same tectonic vocabulary in simple  homes and in imperial palaces.  Some of his readers disagreed. The writer Fritz Flüeler  pointed out that Gothic architecture was an example of monu- mental architecture that broke with classicism: why would the  development of another nonclassical style for monumental  buildings be unthinkable? Another respondent, the historian  Theodor Willy Stadler, criticized Meyer’s endorsement of  monumental state architecture as a way of ceding to the state  “unrestricted power in a social disguise.” Stadler used the  example of monastic architecture to demonstrate that the ver- nacular and “profane” in architecture was intertwined with the  monumental and sacred. Meyer answered his critics, stressing  that the microcosm of the medieval monastery did not exist  anymore, and that the differentiation between the sacred and  the profane, the monumental and nonmonumental, affected all  realms of life.36  In 1942, Meyer praised in his journal the new architectural  ensemble of the Miséricord University of Fribourg, Switzer- land, by Fernand Dumas and Denis Honegger (1938–41, Fig- ure 10a, b), a work strongly influenced by Auguste Perret  (1874–1954), who was both Honegger’s teacher and later  employer. He viewed the Miséricord University as an alter- native to the more radical version of Swiss modernism as  represented by Hans Schmidt (1893–1972) and Hannes Meyer  (1889–1954); the building’s fine concrete ossature suggested  15 </page> <page sequence="17"> 10, 11 (opposite).

At this time the division between the Swiss avant- garde,  supported and organized by Sigfried Giedion, the secretary of  the CIAM, and the program of the “New Monumentalism” as  put forward by Peter Meyer became visible—only to disappear  very soon, since Giedion’s theory was about to undergo signifi- cant revisions. For Meyer, Giedion’s embrace of technology as  the driving force of modern culture was just as unacceptable  as Meyer’s emphasis on convention and historical continuity  for Giedion. A direct polemical exchange between Meyer and  Giedion took place in 1934, when Meyer reminded his audience  of Giedion’s earlier rejection of the use of human proportions  in architecture, contrasting it with Le Corbusier’s and Aalto’s  recent interest in proportioning systems. Giedion responded by  distinguishing between the human dimension of architecture  related to needs and social responsibility, which he embraced,  and a mimetic anthropomorphism, which he rejected. But his  subsequent interpretations of the human dimension suggest  that Meyer had a point.  Lewis Mumford raised in 1947 a very similar polemical  argument. In his contribution to The New Yorker, he pointed  out a shift among the East Coast proponents of the modern  movement—who organized the important and influential 1932  exhibition Modern Architecture in the Museum of Modern Art— regarding their theoretical affiliations: 16 </page> <page sequence="18">  </page> <page sequence="19"> The very critics, such as Henry- Russell Hitchcock, who  twenty years ago were identifying the “modern” in  architecture with Cubism in painting and with a general  glorification of the mechanical and the impersonal and  aesthetically puritanic have become advocates of Frank  Lloyd Wright. [. . .] Sigfried Giedion, once a leader of the  mechanical rigorists, has come out for the monumental  and the symbolic, and among the younger people an incli- nation to play with the “feeling” elements in design—with  color, texture, even painting and sculpture—has become  irrepressible. [. . .] The rigorists placed the mechanical  functions of a building above its human functions: they  neglected the feelings, the sentiments, and the interests  of the person who was to occupy it. Instead of regarding  engineering as a foundation for form, they treated it as  an end.37  Indeed, Giedion’s change of mind regarding monumen- tality is striking, as he seems to echo ideas of his Zurich  opponent, Peter Meyer. Giedion began teaching at Harvard  University in 1938, just about the time when Peter Meyer devel- oped his theory of modern monumentality. Giedion gave the  Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1938–39, which he published  in 1941 in revised form as Space, Time and Architecture, a  synthetic treatment of new discoveries in science, technical  achievements, and new tendencies in art and architecture.  But just two years later, in 1943, he wrote with Josep  Lluís Sert, Fernand Léger, and Sigfried Giedion the manifesto  “Nine Points on Monumentality.” This “revisionism” was an  important message for Giedion’s American audience, which  was looking already for possibilities to modify the program  of European modernism to make it fit the needs of postwar  American society. As in Switzerland, the American debate  on new monumentality did not focus on the issue of historic  preservation. The chapter on new monumentality in Paul  Zucker’s New Architecture and City Planning, which is the most  important early contribution to the American discourse in the  topic, contains Giedion’s text “The Need for a New Monumen- tality,” Louis I. Kahn’s “Monumentality,” Philip L. Goodwin’s  “Monuments” (discussing the issue of memorials), Ernest  Fiene’s “Figurative Arts and Architecture: Mural and Architec- tural Sculpture,” but no contribution on preservation.38 In 1958,  when Lewis Mumford wrote against the demolition of Pennsyl- vania Station, the debate was already over, both in the United  States and Switzerland. Henry Hope Reed’s 1952 essay “Monu- mental Architecture, Or the Art of Pleasing in Civic Design,” in  the first issue of Perspecta, connected the term monumentality  with “GRANDEUR, MAJESTY, MAGNIFENCE” befitting of “the  18 </page> <page sequence="20"> most powerful nation of the world.”39 Reed proudly emphasized  that the representation of this power was the real monumental  task of time, rejecting any preservationist claim: “We may an- nounce to the world ten thousand times a day that we are plain  simple folk like the rest, but the world will persist in thinking  that we are more fortunate. While we pass our time in tell- ing the world of our youth and of our abundance, we are bold  enough to declare that we have invented everything ourselves  and that, particularly in the arts, we have no use for the past  or the example of other nations.”40 Obviously, issues of “state  pathos,” spirituality, and community, discussed by Peter Meyer  in Zurich, entered the intertwined web of aesthetics, psychol- ogy, and political ideology to shape the American debate.
