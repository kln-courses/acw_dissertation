Very few investigations have taken into consideration younger students, and none have related children's ideas about the origin of species to formal instruction on this topic. To help fill this gap, the present study examines the effect of this instruction in elementary school children by comparing Italian second graders (n = 21; age = 7 years, 1 month, to 8 years, 7 months) with third graders (n = 18; age = 8 years, 1 month, to 9 years, 4 months) who had been taught about "the earth before humans" for several months in keeping with the Italian National Syllabus for this grade level. Semistructured interviews were used to examine children's thoughts about speciation. The majority of second graders used a creationist framework, whereas most third graders used a mixed framework (referring to both creation and evolution) or an evolutionary framework. However, children did not know about the mechanism of evolution and considered it to be the result of the passage of time, the use and disuse of body parts, or the need to adapt to a changing environment, as suggested by their teacher and textbooks. Biological evolution?that is, "change in the hereditary characteristics of groups of organisms over the course of generations" (Working Group on Teaching Evolu tion, 1998, p. 13)?is one of the most important concepts in the history of science. Understanding this concept has great cultural and practical value for students Correspondence should be addressed to Anna Emilia Berti, Dipartimento di Psicologia dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy.

However, a number of investiga tions conducted over recent decades in various countries with secondary school and university students and lay adults have documented widespread incorrect con ceptions about the origin of species that are not easily changed through instruction (e.g., Bizzo, 1994; Brumby, 1984; Ferrari &amp; Chi, 1998; Green, 1990; Jim?nez Aleixandre, 1994; Moore et al., 2002; Settlage, 1994; Shtulman, 2006; Sinatra, Southerland, McConaughy, &amp; Demastes, 2003; Tidon &amp; Lewontin, 2004). As sug gested by Evans (2008), a developmental framework to help explain how these conceptions first emerge may be useful in suggesting how they become entrenched and in providing clues about when and how to teach scientific notions. Very few studies have examined children's understanding of the origin of spe cies. Those that have have been conducted in countries where there is no formal in struction about evolution in elementary school (Evans, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Samarapungavan &amp; Wiers, 1997); thus, they have only been able to address chil dren's intuitive conceptions and how they are affected by general cultural factors such as living in communities with different religious beliefs. The present investi gation aims to add to this literature with data collected in a country (Italy) where evolution is provided for in the National Elementary School Syllabus. These data may give some clues about how children's conceptions are affected by specific cultural tools such as the information about evolution made available to them in textbooks and school lessons. ADOLESCENTS' AND ADULTS' UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES Research conducted with secondary school and university students and lay adults has highlighted two main incorrect views about the origin of species. The one more discordant with current scientific explanations is creationism, according to which species were created by God independently of one another and either have not changed since then or have changed only in terms of their secondary character istics (Gould, 1981; Mayr, 1982). National surveys have shown that in various countries, some people (ranging from about 50% in Turkey to less than 10% in Ice land) agree with the creationist view, at least insofar as it explains the origin of hu mans (Miller, Scott, &amp; Okamoto, 2006). In addition, as documented by Lerner (2000) and Dagher and BouJaoude (1997), several Protestant evangelicals and fol lowers of other monotheistic religions also believe in the direct creation of every living being as a literal interpretation of the Bible. The other incorrect view, found in students who accept the notion of evolution, regards the processes through which evolution occurs. When asked to explain how a certain trait (e.g., the speed of a cheetah or the color of a polar bear's fur) might have changed, most students do not appeal to the Darwinian mechanisms of</page><page sequence="3">508 BERTI ET AL. random variation and natural selection. They state instead that these changes result from the environment itself, or from the animal' s need for survival, or from the use and disuse of a body part (Bizzo, 1994; Brumby, 1984; Green, 1990; Moore et al., 2002; Settlage, 1994; Shtulman, 2006; Sinatra et al., 2003; for a review, see Alters &amp; Nelson, 2002). These explanations are kindred to part of Lamarck's account of evolution, according to which two processes cause body changes that are transmit ted to offspring: an internal tendency (inherent in every living being) to become more complex, and use and disuse (i.e., development of body parts that are used more, and a reduction in less often used parts when a living being adapts to a changing environment; Gould, 2002). Convergent evidence shows that "Lamarckian" conceptions, as well as crea tionist conceptions, are robust and resistant to change. Often students with these views have already attended one or more biology courses (Alters &amp; Nelson, 2002; Demastes-Southerland, Good, &amp; Peebles, 1995; Lawson &amp; Worsnop, 1992). Some well-planned instructional interventions have failed or attained only modest success (e.g., Bishop &amp; Anderson, 1990; Demastes-Southerland et al., 1995; Law son &amp; Worsnop, 1992). Even biology teachers (Jim?nez Aleixandre, 1994; Tidon &amp; Lewontin, 2004) have been found to differentiate unclearly between Darwinian and Lamarckian accounts of evolution. The explanations about the basis and robustness of misconceptions about the origin of the species proposed by cognitive and educational psychologists have fo cused mainly on cognitive factors (Evans, 2000a, 2000b), that is, the complexity of the Darwinian theory of evolution and "the cognitive affinity" of creationism and Lamarckian conceptions of evolution with certain propensities of the human mind. Less attention has been paid to social factors, that is, to the availability and clarity of information about evolution and related topics. COGNITIVE OBSTACLES TO EVOLUTIONARY THINKING Several sources of difficulty have been identified in Darwin's theory. These in clude the numerous prerequisite notions involved?such as population, variation, proportion?and their highly abstract nature (Fischer &amp; Yan, 2002; Mayr, 1982). Then, following Darwin (1872), the vast time frame in which evolution takes place (Atran, 1994; Catley, &amp; Novick, 2009) and the difficulty of visualizing a mecha nism through which a series of different species could result from small variations in a common ancestor (Samarapungavan &amp; Wiers, 1997). It has also been argued that natural selection is a "process of equilibration" (Ferrari &amp; Chi, 1998) or, as it has been more recently relabeled, an "emergent process" (Chi, 2005), that is, a pro cess of uniform, simultaneous, and independent actions (such as finding food, breeding, being killed by or escaping a predator). It has been demonstrated that</page><page sequence="4">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 509 equilibration or emergent processes (e.g., the diffusion of dye in water, the opera tion of market forces, electricity, heat) are often confused with "direct processes" made up of distinct and sequential actions. Lamarckian misconceptions are thus an example of those that occur for numerous concepts across many domains (Chi, 2005). Lay people conceive evolutionary change as a change in a certain trait that takes place gradually in all individuals of a species rather than a change in the pro portion of individuals with that trait (Ferrari &amp; Chi, 1998). According to other authors, the theory of evolution is not really so complex, at least when compared with physics and mathematics (Dawkins, 1986). According to Evans (2008), "An understanding of evolution does not require complex ideas that take years to acquire, such as mathematical reasoning or an understanding of genetics" (p. 271). Rather than its complexity, what prevents most people from ac cepting or understanding evolutionary theory is the fact that it is at odds with na?ve theories, namely na?ve psychology and na?ve biology, that provide frameworks for commonsense explanations of natural phenomena, thus making it counterintuitive. From this view, "to appreciate evolutionary arguments requires a radical concep tual change" (Evans, 2008, p. 271). Na?ve theories, which are innate (Atran, 1994) or emerge in the first years of life (Gelman, 2003; Kelemen, 1999), provide human beings with some rules (also known as constraints or biases) that allow infants and young children to learn about the world more effectively than if they had to learn everything from scratch. However, these rules become obstacles when learners face phenomena that do not operate according to them. The rules that, according to Evans (2008; Sinatra, Brem, &amp; Evans, 2008), act as "conceptual barriers" to evolutionary thinking are essentialism, teleology, and the intentional constraint. Essentialism is the tendency to represent a species (as well as other natural kinds and, to a certain extent, social groups) as possessing a dis tinct, intrinsic, and permanent nature common to all its members (Atran, 1994; Ev ans, 2000b, 2001; Samarapungavan &amp; Wiers, 1997). Teleology is the tendency to explain why something exists or occurs by supplying a function or goal. The inten tional constraint is the tendency to think that events not only are purposeful but are produced on purpose by a human-like agent. According to Evans (2008), these ten dencies "resonate better with a creationist ideology" (p. 269), but they might also account for the prevalence of Lamarckian rather than Darwinian accounts among those who endorse an evolutionary view of the origin of the species, as suggested by Shtulman (2006). Indeed, according to Gould (1996), essentialism underlies the "fallacy of reified variation," that is, the tendency "to abstract a single ideal or av erage as the essence of a system and to devalue or ignore variation among the indi viduals that constitute the full population" (p. 40), which is apparent even for past evolutionary biologists such as Lamarck and Haeckel. Teleology may underlie the idea of evolution as directed toward the goal of adapting to, instead of being con tingent on, particular environmental conditions (Evans, 2008).</page><page sequence="5">510 BERTI ET AL. CONTEXTUAL OBSTACLES TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY Everyone brought up in a monotheistic religion has learned about the account of the creation of humans and animals found in the Bible, which is regarded not only by Jews and Christians but also by Muslims as a book inspired by God (Kritzeck, 1965). Various religious organizations explicitly support creationism and a literal ist view of the Bible (Lerner, 2000). Even incorrect views of evolution can be taught both informally by parents and media and formally by the school. The diffu sion of misconceptions among adults makes it likely for these misconceptions to be transmitted to children. In addition, correct but schematic or implicit accounts of evolution could be misinterpreted because of the different meanings that terms such as adaptation and fitness have in evolutionary theory and in common lan guage (Alters &amp; Nelson, 2002). When talking about evolution, expert biologists frequently use metaphoric teleological and anthropomorphic patterns that are likely to confuse students (Halld?n, 1988; Jungwirth, 1975). These patterns also occur in written texts (Berti &amp; Toneatti, in press). The early learning of Lamarckian accounts and their repeated corroboration by books and other media could be an additional explanation for the entrenchment of such accounts and their resistance to change. If this were the case, children's conceptions about the origin of species should be less entrenched than those of older students and more likely to change when challenged by discordant information. Elementary school might thus be the appro priate level not only for paving the way for the notion of evolution by building a knowledge base about diversity and the apparent relatedness of species, as sug gested by the benchmarks created by the American Association for the Advance ment of Science (2001; see also Evans, 2006), but also for introducing children to the notion of evolution and, possibly, for providing some clues as to the processes from which it results. CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES The role of contextual factors in the development of different explanations of the origin of species has been only partially addressed in studies conducted with chil dren. The purpose of the first study, carried out by Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997), was only to examine whether children's answers fit broad and coherent "explanatory frameworks" similar to historical precursors of current scientific the ories. The participants were 35 Dutch children aged 8 to 12 who were asked how the first animals came into being. They were asked (a) to order two series of pic tures of species on two time lines to indicate when each species first appeared on</page><page sequence="6">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 511 earth and (b) to explain how various species came to have certain traits (e.g., gi raffes their long necks, polar bears their thick white fur). As the authors expected, most children expressed coherent views. In addition, these views were quite different from those revealed by studies conducted with older students and lay adults. Very few children gave creationist or evolutionist answers; the majority of them showed instead various kinds of essentialist frame works. They said that current animal types had always existed, or that they had spontaneously generated from soil or plant matter and never changed, or that the earth in the beginning was populated by the "dinosaur ancestors" of present animal types that derived from them through adaptation to a changing environment. Ac cording to Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997), it was very unlikely that these frameworks had been learned directly from adults, because they were not present in the adult population. Lastly, no age-related shifts emerged in this study. This might be explained by the small sample size, but one reason proposed by Samarapungavan and Wiers was the fact that children had not yet had any formal instruction in evolutionary biology. Assessing the contribution of cognitive and contextual factors to the emergence of creationist and evolutionary beliefs was the explicit purpose of the series of studies conducted by Evans with 5- to 12-year-olds from various areas of the United States and from different cultural and religious backgrounds (Evans, 2000a, 2000b, 2001 ; for a summary, see Evans, 2008). Children (and in some stud ies also their parents) had to explain how "the very first" member of three species (i.e., humans and two nonhuman species) appeared on earth. It turned out that whereas children with fundamentalist parents were creationist at all ages, the other children showed age differences. Most 6- to 7-year-olds gave a mixed pattern of "spontaneous generation" beliefs (according to which animals had a natural but nontransformational origin, such as being born from eggs or seeds or simply hav ing appeared or grown) and creationist beliefs. These beliefs were quite similar to one of the essentialist frameworks described by Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997). Most 8- to 10-year-olds were exclusively creationist, whereas 10- to 12-year-olds and adults were evenly divided in three groups: one exclusively creationist, one exclusively evolutionist, and one with mixed evolutionist and creationist beliefs. According to evolutionist beliefs, an animal derives from the transformation of a previous different kind of animal (indicated with a distinct name; e.g., a person from a gorilla). In one of these studies, Evans (2000b, Study 1) also assessed children's expla nations of how these transformations might occur. Similar to the previous litera ture on students' understanding of evolution, she found that only 1 child out of 46 appealed to Darwinian mechanisms. All others mentioned physiological changes often subsequently inherited or volitional/behavioral mechanisms, according to which animals changed because they wanted or needed to change or because they learned a new skill.</page><page sequence="7">512 BERTI ET AL. On the whole, the results of Evans's investigations indicate that between the ages of 10 and 12 years old, American children's conceptions converge with those of adult members of their community. This might suggest that, unlike essentialist beliefs, creationist and evolutionist beliefs are learned from adults. Age-related differences could result in part from different (or accumulating) opportunities to be provided with or to come across information relevant to creation and evolution. Evans rejected this possibility, however. Assuming that "the environments where children lived were similar across age groups (at least with respect to community beliefs)" (p. 235), Evans (2000b) contended that the main factors underlying age-related changes in the children from non-fundamentalist communities were cognitive development and the enrichment of their general biological knowledge, which led children to confront certain problems and accept certain kinds of ideas. From this view, the shift at the age of 8 to 10 years to exclusive creationism came about because children of this age were beginning to contemplate existential themes of how things began, whereas younger children believed in a static and unchanging world. Through these years, strong essentialist beliefs in the immuta bility of species, and teleological and finalistic thinking, make children very will ing to endorse creationist ideas and generally unreceptive to evolutionary ex planations. Only from early adolescence do children become "ready to abandon creationist theories of origin and adopt a naturalistic explanation that violate[s] their strong beliefs in the immutability of species" (Evans, 2001, p. 249). According to Evans (2000b), this "change of perspective from one in which species are regarded as timeless entities with a God-given essence, to one in which species have a definite historical location" (p. 248) seems to be brought about by accumulating biological knowledge, because positive correlations emerged be tween evolutionary beliefs, knowledge about fossils, and "dynamic adaptation" beliefs (i.e., the belief that animals can change during their lifetime to adapt to their habitat and can transmit altered traits to their offspring). According to Evans (2000b), this knowledge and these beliefs are not only necessary concomitants of evolutionary beliefs but also conditions for their construction. This view has been strengthened by a more recent study revealing a relation between the acceptance of radical within-individual change, such as metamorphosis, and evolutionary con cepts (Evans, Rosengren, Szymanowsky, Smith, &amp; Johnson, as cited in Evans, 2008), thus suggesting that "teaching children about metamorphosis may provide them with the basis for modifying an early cognitive constraint, namely an essentialist bias" (Evans, 2008, p. 277). The Possible Contribution of Cultural Tools to Children's Conceptions of the Origin of Species The availability of explicit information about the origin of species might have a more direct and pivotal role in age-related changes in children's conceptions of the</page><page sequence="8">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 513 origin of species than indicated by the Evans investigations. This is suggested not only by views underlining the impact of explicit instruction on conceptual change (e.g., Kirschner, Sweller, &amp; Clark, 2006; Vosniadou, 2007) but also by the cross-cultural differences in children's accounts of the origin of species high lighted by the few studies on this topic. As seen previously, unlike American children who often provided mixed answers, the majority of Dutch children inter viewed by Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997) expressed coherent views, al though, having been asked more numerous and diverse questions, they had a greater opportunity to reply with "mixed answers." In addition, very few Dutch children gave creationist or evolutionist answers, which were the most frequent answers given among American children of the same age range. Lastly, no age-re lated shifts were found in the Dutch sample. It appears that although both have been described as not having formal instruc tion in evolution, American and Dutch children did have different access to infor mation about the origin of species. American children from non-fundamentalist families seem to have had more access to both creationist and evolutionist views than Dutch children, and probably in an age-related way. This seems to have af fected both the content and coherence of their conceptions. In addition, the ab sence of an age trend in the Dutch sample suggests that cognitive development does not bring about different views of the origin of species if not triggered or nur tured by relevant information. More precise information about public representa tions of the origin of species generally available in a certain country, as well as the cultural tools explicitly aimed at children and their accessibility to different age groups, is necessary to be able to assess the extent to which age differences are brought about by contextual factors and direct teaching. THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION ABOUT EVOLUTION IN ITALY Information about evolution is widely available in Italy, where the vast majority of the native population (97% according to the most recent survey conducted by the Holy Seat statistical office) is Catholic (Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae 2006, 2008). This is possibly because of the Roman Catholic Church's position on this topic, as stated for the first time in the encyclical Humani generi, issued by Pope Pius XII in 1950. This document makes a clear distinction between the human soul, as created by God, and the human body, in which the soul is incorporated. Therefore, "the Church does not forbid scientists and theologians from discussing and researching evolution, as long as the research focuses on finding out if the hu man body came from already existing living matter" (Pope Pius XII, 1950, p. 17). In addition to the many books on evolution addressed to adults, several books and films for children track the evolution of animals (and, in lesser detail, plants) from</page><page sequence="9">514 BERTI ET AL. the first unicellular living being onward. Some of these books are available in book shops, others in the more numerous and accessible newsstands. For instance, in the past 3 years news agents have sold the Italian translations of three series including volumes of prehistory and evolution (i.e., Lambert, Nash, &amp; Wyse, 2001; Richard son, 2003; Gamlin, 1993). There are also great age-related differences in the avail ability of information about evolution in Italy. "Earth before man" was a topic cov ered in most elementary schools, although it was not explicitly mentioned in the syllabus for some decades. In the new national syllabus issued by the Italian Govern ment in 2004 (law by decree February 19th, n. 59) this has become the main topic of history in the third grade (8-9 years). Most textbooks start with the origin of the uni verse; continue with the emergence and evolution of life, from the first microorgan isms to mammals; follow this with human evolution; and conclude with the rise of the first civilizations. Most textbooks present a time line showing the main geologi cal and biological events that occurred from the Big Bang to the appearance of Homo sapiens. Although they usually state that more recent animal kinds derived from transformations of previous ones, they either do not explain how this occurred or suggest Lamarckian explanations (Berti &amp; Toneatti, 2009). An investigation of how history is taught in Italian elementary schools showed that most teachers rely on textbooks and similar didactic material when preparing and delivering their lessons (Pievani, 2000). AIMS OF THE PRESENT STUDY If a major cause of age-related change in children's conceptions of the origin of species is differential access to relevant information, significant differences be tween second and third graders should be found in Italy, unlike the results of previ ous studies in the United States and Holland. Testing this hypothesis was the main purpose of the present study. We expected most second graders to be creationists, similar to American children of the same age (Evans, 2000a, 2000b, 2001). How ever, the teaching of evolution as usually takes place in Italian elementary schools far from meets the requirements (described by Chinn &amp; Brewer, 1993; Duit, Treagust, &amp; Widoo, 2008; among others) necessary in order to produce a radical conceptual change. These include, for instance, addressing children's prior knowl edge, providing them with a clear and coherent alternative view, and supporting the new view and illustrating its fruitfulness with evidence. We expected, there fore, that most third-grade children would show "mixed beliefs" resulting from more or less peripheral changes in a previously creationist view. Another aim of the present study was to compare children's accounts of the ori gin of humans with their accounts of the origin of other animals. Evans (2001) found that American children who gave evolutionary answers about animals often depicted humans as having been created by God, and parents who said that they</page><page sequence="10">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 515 would give evolutionary explanations for the origin of dinosaurs also said that they would rather give creationist explanations for the origin of humans. This might also suggest that Italian children's answers about the origin of humans would lag behind those about the origin of other animals. However, the availability of infor mation on human evolution is likely to be different in the United States and Italy. Several U.S. states have responded to creationist pressures by dealing with the evolution of plants and animals but ignoring human evolution in their science cur ricula (Lerner, 2000). In Italian elementary schools, the evolution of humans is generally considered in greater detail than the evolution of other animals. Third grade textbooks usually present a series of close ancestors of modern humans, starting with the Australopithecus and including (detailed within the main text or in a time line only) Homo habilis, Homo robustus, and Homo neanderthalensis. The greater space and time dedicated to this topic provides textbooks and teachers with more opportunities to explicitly state or suggest not only that different homi nids appeared one after another but also that some were ancestors of others (Berti &amp; Toneatti, in press). Although they have not yet come across this topic at school, Italian second graders have at least as many opportunities to learn about primitive humans in books or television as they have to learn about the proximate ancestors of other animals. The similarity between modern and primitive humans should also stimulate questions about their relations. For children with creationist views, this might be one of the first anomalies they come across with respect to a creationist framework. We therefore expected children's views about the ori gin of humans to be similar to, or more advanced than, their views about other animals. METHOD Participants Participating in the experiment were 12 female and 9 male children attending a second-grade class (M age = 7 years, 9 months; range = 7 years, 1 month, to 8 years, 4 months) and 6 female and 12 male children attending a third-grade class (M age = 8 years, 8 months; range = 8 years, 1 month, to 9 years, 7 months) in a public primary school in a town near Varese (northern Italy). With the exception of two children born in Italy of North African parents, all were from Italian families. All children attended religion lessons, which in Italy are taught in all primary and secondary schools according to a syllabus provided by the Catholic Church. Atten dance is not compulsory, but it is chosen by the great majority of Italian students (91% in 2006, according to the Presidency of the Italian Episcopal Conference, 2008).</page><page sequence="11">516 BERTI ET AL. Procedure The interviews were conducted toward the end of the school year, between April and May. A female experimenter interviewed children individually in a quiet room. The interviews lasted about 25 min; all were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Pa per-and-pencil notes provided information about children's ordering of animals on a time line (described in "Children's Interview"). At the time of this investigation, each elementary school class had three main teachers (who also taught other classes). One taught Italian, art, and music; one taught history, geography, and social studies; one taught sciences, math, and gym. Religion lessons were taught by an other teacher, who covered several classes. The teacher of religion for both classes and the third-grade history teacher were interviewed about how, and for how long, they had taught the origin of species and evolution. How these topics were dealt with in children's textbooks and exercise books was also examined. What Children Had Been Taught About the Origin of Animals The teachers' interviews and the examination of children's textbooks and exercise books can be summarized as follows. Second graders had dealt with the origin of species during religion classes only. In January, the teacher had spent two 2-hr les sons reading and explaining the Bible passages about creation (Genesis 1). Third graders had dealt with the origin and evolution of life (mainly that of ani mals) during history lessons. Their teacher said she had spent about 30 hr over 2 months (from December to February) dealing with nonhuman animals and 24 hr (from February to the end of March) dealing with the origin of humans. Following the new syllabus, the teacher first introduced the issue of how the earth and its in habitants began and then underlined that humans had proposed three different kinds of answers for these questions: mythological, religious, and scientific. Myth ological answers were illustrated by myths from past civilizations (e.g., Chinese, Mayan, Babylonian), and religious answers were illustrated with the passages about creation from the Book of Genesis. The scientific account was presented as the most reliable and was referred to for the remaining lessons. First life was said to have begun in water, where small microorganisms formed. The appearance of various animals (sea invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, humans) was then described. Textbooks for the third grade and other texts issued by the teacher could sug gest that distinct animal kinds simply appeared one after another. But sometimes it was explicitly stated than one animal kind derived from another. For instance, ac cording to one text: "About 350 million years ago some fish left the water and gave rise to amphibians, that is animals who lived partly on the land and partly in the water.... Later, about 250 million years ago, reptiles appeared" (Cattaneo, 2006). In addition, in her lessons, the teacher stressed the concept of evolution, described</page><page sequence="12">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 517 the transformation from one kind to another (some fish became amphibians, some amphibians become reptiles), and repeatedly said that the first microorganisms were the common ancestors of all living beings. In a short text about evolution is sued to the class, evolution was defined as "change, transformation over time. It depends on the adaptation of a living being to the environment where it lives" (em phasis in the original). The teacher added that evolution is a slow and gradual change that takes place over long periods and that animals adapted, that is, changed, to suit the changing climate. She also provided another definition of ad aptation as the development, over a long time, of body parts more useful to sur vival. While talking in the interview about these points, the teacher often said "spe cies, in order to adapt, tried other solutions," which suggests an idea of intentional action that she might also have transmitted to her pupils. Finally, several lessons concerned dinosaurs and their extinction. The text and pictures used to discuss the origin of humans depicted a sequence comprising Ramapithecus (described as a kind of ape living 15 million years ago), Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens. From the texts and the teacher's interview, it is evident that there was a suggestion of linear progression leading from one hominid to the next in the sequence and resulting from a progressive loss or reduction in body parts (hair, powerful teeth) and from "learning" more and more skills. Children's Interview The children's interview was based on the first part of Samarapungavan and Wiers' s (1997) questionnaire, which was aimed at drawing a broad and detailed picture of children's conceptions of the origin of species. All of the children were asked the following questions: Were there always animals on earth from the very beginning? (If not) How did the first animal come into being? When did it happen? What did the first animal look like? Were early animals different from those which exist today? (If different) Why were the first animals different? How did it come about? In addition, we asked how animals existing nowadays had come into being, if at the same time or at different times, in order to check whether any children thought that different ani mals had appeared or been created at different times. This idea might be suggested by the time line found in most elementary school textbooks or by the descriptions of different animals as having "appeared" at different times. After children had answered this first series of questions, the interviewer pro vided them with a time line (only one, to make the interview simpler) and one set of animal pictures representing fish, a turtle, a dinosaur, a Neanderthal man, and modern man (as in Samarapungavan and Wiers's, 1997, sets) and a fly, lizard, bird, and cow (instead of seaweed, a tree, a jellyfish, a starfish, millipedes, butter flies, a crocodile, a mammoth, a rhinoceros) to represent, through familiar exem plars, invertebrates, reptiles, and mammals.</page><page sequence="13">518 BERTI ET AL. The animals were drawn in black and white on nine cards of about 5x5 cm. The interviewer spread the pictures out on the table in random order and asked the child to name each of them, correcting him or her if a picture was misunderstood (which occurred very rarely). She then put the time line on the table; this was a 50 20 cm length of paper with a line drawn along the bottom. Under the line (at the left end, at 20 cm from the left end, at 40 cm from the left end, and at the right end) was writ ten Long, long ago; Long ago; A short time ago; and Now. The interviewer told the child that the line represented a time line spanning from long, long ago to now and invited him or her to place the animals along it according to the order of their ap pearance. She said that animals that appeared more or less at the same time could be placed one above the other on the same point of the time line. Unlike in Samarapungavan and Wiers's (1997) procedure, the children were also asked to explain their criteria of ordering after they had finished. Some of them spelled out these criteria spontaneously while performing the task. Questions about the arrangement of the pictures of primitive and modern man (What is this? Why did you put him here?) provided an opportunity to ask ques tions about the origin of humans. However, four children spontaneously said that the first humans were similar to apes while talking about the differences between the first animals and those existing now. In these cases, questions about the origin of humans were addressed at that point in the interview. On the whole, the interviews were rather flexible. The same topics were cov ered with all children, but the order of the questions could change. Follow-up ques tions were asked when necessary to clarify a child's answer. For instance, if a child said that the first animals had come into being from eggs, the interviewer asked where the eggs had come from. When children used the word evolution or said that an animal had evolved, the interviewer repeated the word to stimulate the child to spell out the meaning or explicitly asked what it meant. Scoring Similar to Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997), there were two levels of scoring: one regarding individual topics and the other for the overall pattern of answers. On the first level, children's conceptions about each topic regarding nonhuman species (which could be assessed through one or more questions) were coded in categories devised, refined, and applied in two rounds. During the first round, one judge (Anna Emilia Berti) coded the answers using the categories from Samarapungavan and Wiers's Item Level Scores for Speciation Questions. When these categories did not apply, or when a question was not found in Samarapun gavan and Wiers's questionnaire, new categories were devised in a bottom-up manner by carefully reading all of the participants' protocols. Following Chi (1997), after this preliminary coding, the features characterizing each category more precisely were identified and defined. These categories (described in the Ap</page><page sequence="14">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 519 pendix) were given to two independent judges, who scored the protocols with agreement ranging from 85% to 100%. Disagreement was resolved through dis cussion between the two judges. On the second level, the entire series of answers about nonhuman species was scored in one of four frameworks (described later) depending on the pattern of an swers to individual topics. Answers about the origin of humans, that is, of primitive and modern man, were scored separately to check their coherence with the explana tory framework used for nonhuman species. Categories about the origin of humans were devised in a bottom-up way by one of the authors by carefully reading all the protocols. The categories were supplied to the two judges, who scored the protocols with an agreement of 90% and resolved their disagreements through discussion. Data Analysis The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to calculate descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) and to evaluate differ ences between grades and genders by means of chi-square tests. Data showed simi lar results for boys and girls; therefore, only the findings for grades are presented. RESULTS Children's Answers at the Individual Topic Level The origin of primal and current animals. No significant differences be tween second and third graders were found regarding how the very first animals came into existence. On the whole, most children (n = 22,56%) said that animals were created by God; about one third (n = 11, 28%) mentioned natural processes, such as the emergence of life from earth or water, the evolution of microorgan isms, or simply the appearance of animals. Lastly, a few children (n = 6,15%) gave mixed answers, mentioning both God's creation and natural processes. For in stance, they said that God created the first animals, which then evolved, or that some animals were made by God and others by natural processes. In spite of the prevalence of creationist answers, the majority of children (n = 24,61%) also said that the very first animals (all or most of them) were different from those living nowadays. This answer was provided by 9 (43%) second graders versus 15 (83%) third graders, a significant difference, 2(1, = 39) = 6.7, &lt; .01. Children explained the differences between early and present animals in two ways: (a) by transformation of primal species, or (b) their extinction accompanied by the independent origin of the more recent animals due to a new creation by God, or to natural processes. Transformations were mentioned by 9 (43%) second grad ers versus 15 (83%) third graders, 2(1, Af = 39) = 6.7, &lt; .01. Independent origin</page><page sequence="15">520 BERTI ET AL. was mentioned by 25 children (67%), without significant age difference. Children did not think that there was a conflict between these two explanations: 61% of those appealing to the transformation of primal species also mentioned the new ap pearance of more recent animals. The transformations described were embellishment, size increase or decrease, and the addition or deletion of body parts. The most frequent explanation of how transformations occurred, given by 15 children (62% of those who mentioned transformations) appealed only to a passing of time and the gradual nature of the transformation, using terms such as "with time," "little by little," "bit by bit," or "slowly." Five children (21%) attributed transformation to the work of God or na ture. Only four children (4%) appealed to dynamic adaptations, mentioning the use and disuse of body parts. They described how certain body parts were worn out by use (e.g., tigers no longer have saber teeth "because they slowly got worn out; per haps they ate food which was too hard"), or disappeared because they were not be ing used (e.g., "dinosaurs did not use their tails, and they started shrinking, because they did not use it"), or resulted from intense activity (e.g., some fish developed small legs "because of all the swimming they did"). While talking about animal transformations, children sometimes used the terms "evolution" (or "to evolve") and "adaptation" ("to adapt"). "Evolution" was used by 13 (77%) third graders and 3 (14%) second graders, 2(1, =39)= 13.5, &lt; .001. Follow-up questions highlighted that all of the children mentioning evolu tion defined it in terms of change or transformation, sometimes with qualifications such as "slow" or "adaptive" (see Excerpts 7, 8, and 11). "Adaptation" was used by 9 (50%) third graders and no second graders, 2(1, = 39) = 13.7, &lt; .001. All of the children mentioning adaptation also mentioned evolution, whereas seven children mentioned evolution without mentioning adap tation, a difference that the McNemar test showed to be significant (p = .016). It therefore seems that most children had come across these words in third grade and that they had learned about evolution earlier than adaptation. When various kinds of animal appeared. Second and third graders also showed different views about how long ago the first animals came into existence: 56% of third graders versus 5% of second graders said that this occurred a certain number of "millions of years ago," whereas 81% of second graders versus 39% of third graders used generic terms such as "many," "some," or "many, many years ago." The remaining children said "I don't know." The age difference was signifi cant, 2(2, =39) = 12.4, &lt; .005. Unlike what Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997) reported, none of the children grouped all or most animals at the left end of the time line. Most (n = 28, 72%) spread the animals along the entire time line, one after the other. Others grouped some of the animals in pairs (n = 7, 18%). Only four children (10%) grouped six animals together, saying that they had come into existence at the same time. We</page><page sequence="16">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 521 coded these responses by giving each animal a score corresponding to its position, with 1 for the left end of the line, and 9 for the right. When two or more animals were placed together, they were scored with their average rank. We expected most children, independent of grade, to put modern humans in the final position because this is suggested by both creationist and evolutionist views. However, we expected grade differences in the first positions, with second graders preferring to put dino saurs and primitive man, as suggested by widespread information that dinosaurs and primitive man are extinct, and third graders placing fish and lizards, coherent with the notion taught at school that life started in the sea and that reptiles were among the first animals living on land. The average and median rank of the various animals, shown in Table 1, only partly confirmed our expectations. The Friedman test revealed significant differences in the rank of animals along the time line in second grade, 2(8, = 21) = 42.8, &lt; .001; and in third grade, 2(8, N=l$) = 64.6, &lt; .001. Post hoc comparisons between pairs (see Siegel &amp; Castellan, 1988) showed that at second grade the rank of dinosaur was signifi cantly lower than most others (i.e., fish, turtle, bird, cow, and modern man) and that primitive man differed from bird, cow, fly, and modern man. At third grade the dinosaur was preceded by fish, and both were ranked significantly lower than most other animals (bird, cow, fly, and modern man). At third grade, fish and dinosaurs shared the first position because some children placed fish (n = 9,50%) in this po sition and others dinosaurs (n = 6,33%). Finally, we compared the scores obtained by the dinosaur, fish, lizard, and primitive man in the two groups of children by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, with overall a = .05 and the Bonferroni correction. Only the differences regarding fish (z - .008, one-tailed) and lizard (z = .004, one-tailed) were significant.

More telling than the positioning of the animals on the time line were children's justifications for the order given. The most frequent justification (n = 21) appealed to the food chain?that is, the first animals to appear were those supposed to supply food to the following ones?which was given by 15 second graders (71%) and 6 third graders (33%), 2(1, = 39) = 5.6, &lt; .05. Next was an evolutionary justifica tion (n = 14), according to which an animal was placed after another if it was re garded (correctly or incorrectly) as evolving from it or after it. This justification was given by 4 second graders (19%) and 10 third graders (56%), 2(1, = 39) = 5.6, &lt; .05. Lastly, 10 children (7 second graders and 3 third graders, 33% and 17%, respec tively, ns) mentioned similarities between adjacent animals (e.g., lizard and dino saur) or thematic relations, such as seeing them together (e.g., cow and fly). On the whole, analyses of children's answers at the individual topic level indi cate that although similar proportions of second and third graders gave creationist and naturalistic answers, third graders had a more precise idea of when life began, were more often aware that the first animals were different from those living now, and were more often aware that these differences resulted from transformations occurring in various animal types. In addition, third graders were more knowl edgeable about which animals appeared first and about evolution. Children's Answers at the Pattern Level Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997) expected, and found, various explanatory frame works similar to historical precursors of current scientific theories of speciation. In contrast, we expected to find only the two distinct frameworks (i.e., the creationist and the evolutionary) existing as "external representations" (Sperber, 1996) in Italy (and, plausibly, in most contemporary cultures), and a third one resulting from their blend. However, while scoring protocols we identified a fourth distinct pattern, which we labeled naturalistic, in which neither creation nor evolution was mentioned, except in terms of embellishment. The issues relevant to this scoring and the criteria used to assign a protocol to a framework are shown in Table 2. Creationist framework. According to this framework, the first animals were created by God and were either the same as those living now or an uglier or bigger ver sion. In the latter case, at a certain point primal animals disappeared and were sup planted by nicer arrimais created later. The first case is illustrated by Excerpts 1 and 2. Excerpt 1: Paolo (third grade)1 (How did the first animal come into being?) From the egg, I think, that is, I mean, from where they are usually born. (Where did the egg come from?) For me.... per Children's literal answers are in italics, questions are in parentheses, and comments or summaries of children's answers are in standard typeface.</page><page sequence="18">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 523 TABLE 2 Pattern of Answers Characterizing the Four Different Explanatory Frameworks of Nonhuman Species Origin Issue Creationist Naturalistic Evolutionary Mixed Animals' origin Which animals began in the present form?

(What were the first an imals like? The same or different from those that exist now?) He made them different from one another: for instance, he made the lion and the cheetah. (OK, but I mean, what was the first lion like: the same or different from the lions we have now?) For me... God made the first lion the same as it is now. (Were only lions or all the first an imals the same as now?) / think that God made all the animals the same as they are now. Putting the dinosaur first on the time line. For me, God created the dinosaur first of all, I have heard my dad say that dinosaurs existed before other animals. Then he put the other animals, with various criteria: for instance, fish to provide food for the other animals, cows to provide drinks, and birds for their songs. Primitive and modern man were put at the end of the line. Excerpt 2: Riccardo (second grade) (How did the first animals come into being?) God created them. (And how did he do it?) He made a big magic spell, and all of them were born. Riccardo went on to say that God created animals at different moments and that the first animals were made in the same way as now. He put dinosaurs first on the time line, explaining: It was a sort of animal who lived a long, long time ago, he ate grass, and they also tried to eat</page><page sequence="19">524 BERTI ET AL. primitive man, but he killed them. Next he put primitive man, followed by modem man and all the other animals, which, he explained, God created to provide humans with a variety of food. The view that primal animals were supplanted at a certain point by a better ver sion is illustrated by Excerpt 3. Excerpt 3: Maria (second grade) Maria explained that the first animals were dinosaurs, in prehistory. Jesus cre ated them. He created all the animals, and also men and the earth. (How did he do it?) With His hands and earth, and then He made them live. According to her, the first animals were different from those living now. There were dinosaurs, but also the other animals were different from now: They were bigger, fatter, and a little uglier. (Why is that?) Because they had just been created, and so He made them a little dif ferent. (How come now they are as they are?) Jesus then created many other animals better. (Do you mean that after the first animals Jesus created other animals?) Jesus created many other better animals.... and He made the first animals disappear, be cause He had to prepare the others, the newer and nicer ones. On the time line Maria put the dinosaur first, followed by primitive and modem man, and next all the other animals. She explained that, before creating humans, Jesus made dinosaurs disappear so that they could not kill humans. The other animals were created after humans to supply food for them and to embellish nature. Naturalistic framework. The main feature of this framework is that it did not involve any Divine intervention, because primal animals just appeared or cre ated themselves. This sounds like "spontaneous generationism" as described by Samarapungavan and Wiers (1997) and Evans (2000, 2001), but in this case chil dren did not show specific beliefs about generation, such as birth from seeds or eggs; they only talked about animals' "appearance." Children scored in this frame work expressed three distinct views about the relations between early animals and those existing now: (a) They were equal; (b) they were different, because early ani mals became extinct and the others appeared later (see Excerpt 4); (c) primal ani mals were ugly, but they were embellished with time (see Excerpt 5). These an swers, suggesting ancestors as uglier versions of present animals, sound like those about "dinosaur ancestors" found by Samarapungavan and Wiers. We included all of these answers in one framework, considering their low frequency. Excerpt 4: Sofia (third grade) After some years animals appeared, with nature they appeared.... I mean, nature appeared with seeds, it appeared on its own, and animals did the same as nature.... they appeared from nothing. ...Ido not know what made this appearance occur, God maybe, or nature. The important thing is that they appeared, otherwise, there would be nothing. Sofia went on to say that the first animals, like dinosaurs, were different</page><page sequence="20">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 525 from those that appeared later and explained how it occurred: After a long time there was evolution, that is.... sorry, I have made a mistake, I meant extinction.... dino saurs disappeared, as well as some of the other animals, and other animals ap peared, the animals that exist now.... for instance the cat, one day it appeared, but some years after dinosaurs had died. While putting the animals on the time line, she talked about their appearance or arrival. Excerpt 5: Claudia (second grade) / think that nature made them, the first, first animals... one hundred years ago. (Is that a little time or a long time ago?) It is long, long ago. They were a little different (from present animals), with fur and longer teeth. Then their face began to change little by little. Evolutionary framework. Children using this framework said that primal an imals either just appeared (see Excerpt 6) or evolved from small organisms (see Ex cerpts 7 and 8) and that other animals arose from their transformation or evolution. Excerpt 6: Susanna (third grade) Susanna said that the first animals created themselves on their own.... several years ago ...18 million years ago ... They were different from those living now: They were sort of wilder, with long hair and nails, ugly.... With time, the animal of nowadays formed, appeared, whereas the others got all extinct, disappeared. While ordering the animals on the time line she said that the animal that formed, and ap pearedfirst was the dinosaur, followed by the lizard. Then fish appeared and learned to go out of the water, on land, like the turtle that is an amphibian and is found in both. When asked how fish learned to live out of the water, Susanna said: Ehm, not all of them. Some of them stayed in the water. Those that went out, their body slowly changed, they got legs, and went out. She did not know how the legs formed, but guessed: May be, because of all the swimming. Excerpt 7: Ilaria (third grade) Eh ... the first organisms were born in water. They were very tiny, transparent, like plankton, things like that. Then, as years went by, over time, these fishes got a lit tle bigger. (How did this come about?) Fish might have evolved from microorgan isms. Evolution is a change over time that occurs when an animal, somebody, adapts to a climate, succeeds in defending themselves from enemies and finding food. As for microorganisms, they were created by themselves. As time went by, water would have developed something ... it was the water, which little by little gathered. Then with evolution the fish came, and then the fish little by little got out of the water, and became amphibians that can live both in the water and out of it. The first animals were different from those living now, for instance, fish had hard shells, because the climate that made evolution made fish change, as well as the other animals. (Do you mean that the climate made all animals evolve?) Yes, I am sure, the climate changed and animals were forced to change in turn, to change their shape, their body parts,</page><page sequence="21">526 BERTI ET AL. like the hard shell that fish lost, because if evolution had not occurred, we would not exist. Excerpt 8: Fabio (third grade) Fabio said that the first animals evolved from tiny things and explained that they were different (from present animals), similar in certain aspects, but also different. (For instance?) Ehm, there was tr?ceraptos instead of rhinoceros, and then it evolved. (Evolved?) Ehm, it adapted to its environment, it happened in this way: The environ ment changed, and it also changed, little by little. While ordering the animals on thetime line, Fabio said first of all the fish. Actually, bacteria are the very first, but you do not have the picture. Then he asked for the picture of an amphibian because fish got out of the water and got used to leaving it, they got used to seeing land, some of them, but I think that they spent most of their time in the water. Placing the lizard, he asked if it was a reptile, while saying the amphibian, while outside the water, evolved into a reptile, it changed, and then it became a dinosaur, a big reptile, and it spent all its time out of the water. Next he put the fly: / think that insects came after dinosaurs. He put the bird next. / think flies evolved into bigger birds. The cow is a mammal, and they came after dinosaurs, actually, not the cow, but the first mam mals. Then man came, the ape-man and like he is now.... The first, small mammals little by little got bigger and bigger, until man arrived, the last evolution of mammals. Mixed framework. The majority of children using a mixed framework gave contradictory answers, mentioning either creation or evolution at different points in the interview or while referring to different animals, as the following excerpts il lustrate. Excerpt 9: Alberto (second grade) At the beginning of the interview, Alberto said that the very first animals were di nosaurs, bom from eggs, and from them other animals evolved: The diplodocus turned into a giraffe; a dinosaur, I do not remember which, turned into a turtle. Later, while putting the animals on the time line, he talked about the independent ap pearance of different animal kinds: First came flies and other insects; then, a long time ago, the fish appeared, and then the dinosaur, because without food sea dino saurs could not exist. Lastly, he said that God created everything. Excerpt 10: Chiara (second grade) Chiara said that the very first animals were dinosaurs, bom from an egg placed by God after the creation of the earth. Regarding the other animals, such as horses, they came from an animal that evolved in time. (Which animal was it?) A crocodile. (Did all animals evolve from the crocodile, or only horses?) Each animal had their own ancestors. They came out of the water. (Water?) There were some tiny little animals, which one day came out of the water and became ancestors. (And how did these little animals appear?) With the water, it collected in a place, and made the small animals.</page><page sequence="22">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 527 Only two children (see Excerpts 11 and 12) showed a coherent synthesis, ac cording to which God created the first animals and then made them evolve. This view corresponds to a theistic form of evolutionary account, like the view pro posed by Lamarck and embraced by most Western religions (Evans, 2000a). Excerpt 11: Giuseppe (third grade) Giuseppe said that the first animals came from God, God created them, but the earth was created by the Big Bang. God created animals, and then they evolved. Evo lution, for him, means change in time. While putting the animal pictures on the time line, he explained: Dinosaurs got their features from the lizard, which evolved be cause it got bigger.... then, a little later hard-shelled fish were born.... God created plankton, and from it hard-shelled fish and normal fish then evolved. Excerpt 12: Luisa (third grade) Regarding the first animals, Luisa said God created them, because He said "Let animals be created, " and they were born. She thought that these animals were differ ent from present ones: They were very small, like plankton, or small fishes, and evo lution, that is change over time, made them different... Fish, dolphins, remained in the water, and the others did not, they left the water and changed, with time ... God wanted them to change ...He might have thought that, that there were not enough of those animals, and to make more of them he activated evolution. The frequency with which children used the different pattern of answers is shown in Table 3. As expected, the proportion of children entertaining a creationist framework was significantly higher in second grade than third grade, 2(1, = 39) = 7.4, &lt; .01, when the mixed pattern prevailed. Only a small minority of children appeared to have a coherent evolutionist framework. The Origin of Humans With only a couple of exceptions, all children recognized primitive man as a precursor of modern humans by labeling him with terms including "man" (such as "ugly man," "primitive man," "ape-man," "Neanderthal man"), the name TABLE 3 Number (%) of Second and Third Graders Providing Different Patterns of Answers Pattern Grade Creationist Evolutionist Naturalistic Mixed Second 11 52% 1 5% 3 14% 6 29% Third 2 11% 5 22% 2 17% 9 50%</page><page sequence="23">528 BERTI ET AL. "hominid," or with more specific names (e.g., "Ramapithecus") and putting his picture before that of modern man on the time line. The other two children, who described the picture as an ape, were told that it actually represented a primitive man. Answers about the origin of primitive and modern man were scored according to one of the four views presented in Table 4. The first two views, which do not involve any evolutionary process, were expressed by the majority of second graders (n = 16,76%) and by a minority of third graders (n = 7, 33%), a difference that was significant, 2(1, = 39) = 5.5, = .02 (see Table 5). Lastly, we cross-tabulated answers about humans with the explanatory frame work children used while talking about nonhuman species (see Table 6). The asso ciation of answers highlighted in this way (Fisher's exact test = 15.017, = .042, two-tailed) suggests that children's conceptions about the origin of humans are co herent with those about the origin of the other animals. All but one child using a creationist framework did not link primitive and modern man, attributing their ex istence to independent creation or appearance, or regarded modern humans as re sulting from God's transformation of primitive man. Children who used an evolu tionary framework for nonhuman species also regarded humans (both, or at least modern) as having evolved. Children with naturalistic or mixed frameworks showed all types of views. DISCUSSION The central finding of the present study is that in Italy, unlike other countries where children's conceptions about the origin of species have been investi gated (i.e., the Netherlands and the United States), significant differences are found between second graders, who have not yet come across the topic at school, and third graders, who have been taught that animals evolved from more primitive ancestors (although they have not been provided with any infor mation about Darwin's theory). These differences emerged in terms of both in dividual topics?such as when the first animals came into existence, the char acteristics of primal versus present animals, and the order in which various animal types appeared?and overall explanatory frameworks. Whereas most second graders showed creationist conceptions, most third graders used a mixed framework, mentioning both creation and evolution. Thus, Italian chil dren differ from both Dutch children (none of whom gave creationist answers; Samarapungavan &amp; Wiers, 1997) and American children of the same age (hardly any of whom gave evolutionist answers; Evans, 2000b, 2001). Rather than contradict one another, these diverse findings highlight the role of instruc tion and cultural mediation in the development of children's conceptions of the origin of species.</page><page sequence="24">I I 1 "S3 ? * li s -s; is 1 ts 'S: Sc*. 6 ^-3 &gt;U * W .1 I -s S? ^ -Ci ) &gt;? -il ?? a - ??

The mixed framework used in the present study by most third graders might, in turn, result from peripheral or central changes (Chinn &amp; Brewer, 1993, 1998) occurring in a creationist view. Although the mixed framework comprises features from two distinct cultural views, not all children who used it gave incoherent an swers. Two children showed a unitary framework based on the idea that God cre ated primal animals and then made them evolve. In this case, the mixed framework should be considered as a coherent "synthetic" theory, if this term can be applied not only to the integration of scientific information and intuitive theories (Vosnia dou &amp; Brewer, 1994) but also to the integration of information related to two theo ries that are culturally transmitted to children. The present data do not clarify the developmental status of mixed views of in coherent and coherent types. The incoherent type, because of its incoherence (Thagard, 1992), may be a transitional step toward a fully fledged evolutionary framework; a return to a creationist framework; or a synthetic, coherent mixed</page><page sequence="26">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 531 framework. The return to a creationist framework may be suggested by the view that there are strong "conceptual barriers" to evolutionary thinking that 8- to 10-year-olds are not able to overcome (Evans, 2008). However, the coherent mixed view, or theistic evolution, is a reconciliation between monotheistic reli gions and the idea of evolution (Evans, 2008) and could become, at least for some individuals, a stable belief system entertained for a long time, possibly for ever. This is also suggested by the findings that 30% of older American children and adults entertain mixed beliefs, accepting an evolutionary origin for nonhu man species and believing in the creation of humans (Evans, 2001). Longitudinal research is needed to highlight where mixed views lead. The results of the pres ent study encourage pursuing this line of research with larger samples and with repeated testing of samples of Italian children at the beginning and end of third grade and later. Although learning at school about the origin of animals and humans appeared to be the main cause of the mixed framework, it is noteworthy that this frame work was also used by a third of second graders, which suggests that the school is not the only source of information about evolution available to Italian children. Present animals as different from those living long ago, and transformations of the species, appeared to be the most widespread pieces of information relevant to evolution, both of which were possessed by 43% of second graders and 83% of third graders. The difference between present and past animal types alone neither involves nor suggests the idea of evolution. Indeed, several children regarded this difference as resulting from a succession of independent appearances or creations. In the present study, children's knowledge of the evolution of animals ap peared to be mainly the result of school teaching, a fact that suggests that in other cases, too, children's evolutionary concepts could derive more from ob taining relevant information than from personal attempts to explain differences between past and present animals and dynamic adaptation, as suggested by Ev ans (2000a). In addition, the results of the current study strongly suggest that the notion of dynamic adaptation emerges later than, and is secondary to, the notion of evolution. Indeed, children talked of evolution more often than adaptation. The few children who suggested explanations for the changes occurring in ani mal types appealed to the mere passing of time as well as to the use or disuse of body parts. These Lamarckian explanations, which are widespread among adults (Shtulman, 2006) and children from 11 to 12 years (Evans, 2000a, 2000b, 2001), were given by only a minority of children in our study and mirrored those sup plied by their teachers and textbooks. This suggests that these explanations re sulted either from "personal inferences" made in an attempt to devise an evolu tionary mechanism more plausible than the mere passing of time or from the finalistic language used by children's textbooks and teachers when talking about evolution.</page><page sequence="27">532 BERTI ET AL. Essentialism and Transformation in Animal Kinds A finding in the current study that deserves particular attention is the large propor tion of children referring to transformations occurring in animals. Some transfor mations, such as becoming more beautiful or losing fur or teeth, could be consid ered minor, more kindred to microevolution (variations within species, such as the proliferation of dog breeds) than to macroevolution (changes that give rise to new kinds of living beings). However, several children talked of present animals as having evolved from very different kinds of past animals, although with certain shared features (such as the rhinoceros from the triceraptos, the giraffe from the diplodocus, and birds from flies, according to some children), and even from mi croscopic organisms, derived in turn from inert matter. This suggests that essentialism, while helping children (and adults) to per ceive stability in their everyday life, might not be a barrier to understanding great changes occurring in other time frames or in a distant past (represented as a mil lion years ago, or long, long ago) or evolution. This is hardly surprising: What children from 7 years (Keil, 1989) and adults do not concede is that an animal changes species during its individual life. However, species are ontologically distinct from their individual members, and the ways and time frames in which individuals and species can change are also distinct. The findings of the current study suggest that even 7- to 9-year-olds can be aware of these ontological dis tinctions. The hypothesis that essentialism may not play a major role in the rejection or misunderstanding of evolution is coherent with analyses showing that Christian religiosity, especially fundamentalism, is the main factor behind adults' rejection of an evolutionary explanation for human evolution (Mazur, 2005). In the case of children, the diffusion of creationist beliefs is likely to be a result of their direct teaching, as data about children from fundamentalist families also suggest (Evans, 2001). The Origin of Humans Direct teaching and public availability of information also appear to be the main causes of the gap between conceptions about the origin of humans and the origin of other animals found in American children (Evans, 2000b) but not their Italian counterparts. The coherence of Italian second and third graders' conceptions about humans and other animals suggests that children spontaneously apply to humans the same explanatory frameworks that they apply to animals and vice versa if they are not prevented from doing so or are presented with diverging explanations, such as those that even American non-fundamentalist parents appeared to give their children (Evans, 2000b, 2001).</page><page sequence="28">CHILDREN'S CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES 533 Possible Sources of Lamarckian Views of Evolution Our findings shed little light on the weight of cognitive and contextual factors in the diffusion of Lamarckian views of evolution, because these views were rarely shown by our children, most of whom explained transformations in animal kinds by referring to the mere passing of time or to the work of God or nature. Lamarckian views are likely to develop gradually after third grade, as the opportu nities to hear and think about evolution accumulate. The idea that evolution may result from need, effort, or teleology is culturally available, as suggested by ele mentary textbooks and teachers, popular books, and the meaning of the term adap tation in everyday language (Alters &amp; Nelson, 2002); in addition, this idea is much simpler than Darwin's theory. Even if some children had the opportunity to hear about natural selection, they are unlikely to have understood it without guided in struction because of its complexity, the abstract concepts involved, and the other difficulties that have been dealt with before (Catley &amp; Novick, 2009; Ferrari &amp; Chi, 1998; Fischer &amp; Yan, 2002; Samarapungavan &amp; Wiers, 1997). However, it has been suggested that Lamarckian views are the "default" explanation of evolu tion for many children and adults because thinking about this topic is constrained by cognitive biases such as essentialism and teleology (Evans, 2008). This might also explain why even elementary school teachers and textbooks suggest the Lamarckian explanation. More generally, the present study and previous studies on children's concep tions of the origin of species cannot support any views about the relative weight of cognitive constraints and cultural inputs in the development of na?ve explanations of evolution, because in none of them were children provided with explicit and clear information about Darwin's theory of evolution. This information should be provided if the aim is (a) to check the extent to which children understand and ac cept this theory and (b) to identify possible obstacles to understanding and accep tance. These aims may be accomplished following the route traced by Bruner (1960) several decades ago, by using intervention studies aimed at teaching ele mentary school children about natural selection and prerequisite notions, such as species, variation, biotic potential (i.e., the excessive number of offspring), and differential survival (Anderson, Fisher, &amp; Norman, 2002). As seen here, even ele mentary school children can obtain information relevant to evolution in and out of school. Being provided with a Darwinian account might prevent them from con structing misconceptions that later become resistant to change, as many studies with secondary school and university students testify. The enterprise is not likely to be easy, but observations from current experimentations, such as the following vignette from a third-grade class discussion, suggest that it is possible and worth undertaking. Several days previously, children were provided with some pages about Cam brian fauna and the evolution of fish, amphibians, and reptiles from a book on evo</page><page sequence="29">534 BERTI ET AL. lution (the Italian translation of Chandler, Taplin, &amp; Bingham, 2000) to read at home. They were invited to mark with quotation marks the points they found more difficult and with exclamation marks those they found most interesting. Marco said that he put exclamation marks only, and the teacher asked him what the most interesting topic was for him: Marco: Pikaia,2 they said that it was a very, very old ancestor of ours, because it was a vertebrate, and at that time there were almost only invertebrates. Piero: They have discovered that even Pikaia was a cordate. Teacher: But why exactly Pikaia? We were saying that there were apes before men. Marta: Because apes would also have ancestors, and these ancestors also have an cestors, until we arrive back at the Pikaia. Chiara: Pikaia has an ancestor as well. Piero : Unicellular cells !

Children say that God created the first animals. 2. Natural process answers. Children mention natural processes, such as the emergence of life from earth or water or the evolution of microorganisms, or simply say that "they appeared." 3. Mixed answer. Children mention both creation and natural processes at the same time or at different points in the interview. Topic: Were the first animals different from those living nowadays? 1. Yes, all of them. 2. Yes, most of them. 3. No, none of them. Topic: Why were the first animals different from present animals? 1. Because the first animals became extinct (they all died) and God created new (present) animals. 2. Because the first animals became extinct (they all died) and others ap peared. 3. Because the first animals evolved (transformed) into the present animals. Topic: Types of transformation from the first to present animals described 1.

Children mention the use and disuse of body parts. Topic: When various kinds of animals appeared 1. Long ago. Children do not use numbers but say that the first animals ap peared some; many; or many, many years ago. 2. One or more million years ago. Topic: Justification for the order of animals placed on the time line 1. Food chain. Children say they put some animals before others because the former provided food for the latter. 2. Evolutionary justifications. Children say (correctly or incorrectly) they placed an animal after another because the latter evolved from it or after it. 3. Justifications based on similarity. Children say they put animals next to each other because they are similar. 4. Justifications based on thematic relations. Children say they put animals next to each other because they move or are seen together.
