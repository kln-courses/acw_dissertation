<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARAHA MOTIF IN THE CHALUKYAN ROCK-CUT CAVES AT BADAMI Preeti Sharma The varaha (boar) has been a popular motif of portrayal in ancient Indian sculptural art. It is believed to have a mythical origin. During the process of creation Brahma, the creator found Prithvi, the Earth, intended for inhabitation of the created beings, missing. Asura Hiranyaksha had hidden it in the depths of the ocean. As Brahma sat in contemplation Vishnu, in a varaha form, appeared out of his nostrils and soon assumed giant proportions. This primeval varaha then plunged into the ocean and after killing Hiranyaksha rescued the Earth. This myth is mentioned in literature in varied versions. II Literary References: In literature the evolution of varaha motif can be traced in two stages, cosmic and avatara. The cosmic stage given in the Vedas and Puranas identified varaha as Prajapati and Brahma with the creator of the earth. The earliest association of varaha with Earth is hinted upon in the Bhumi Sukta of Atharva Veda} Varaha as Prajapati is referred to in the Taittiriya Samhita,2 Kapisthala Katha Samhita and the Kataka Samhita ,3 The Satapatha Brahmana 4 described the Earth as raised by Emusa varaha who in turn was identifiable with Prajapati. Among the Puranas , Markandeya , Visnu, Matsya, Vayut Kurma and Brahmanda Puranas have related varaha to Brahma. They also likened his limbs to the various components of yajna thereby giving rise to the cosmic image of yajna varaha. The Aparajitaprccha also highlighted the cosmological character of varaha.5 From the 4th -5lh centuries AD with the ascendancy of Vaisnavism the concept of avataras of Vishnu became widespread. Consequently, the role of Brahma as the savior of the Earth was passed on to Vishnu to be incorporated in the avatara cycle. Varaha avatara was enumerated in the Linga* Bhagvata1 and Padma 8 Puranas. Besides, the Abhilashitartha Chintamani, Rupamandana , Devatamurtiprakarana , Silparatna , etc. also assigned the varaha to the avatara chakra and provided its iconographie canons. Thus, the varaha myth acquired the twin aspects of yajnavaraha (in a zoomorphic form) and bhuvaraha (in an anthropomorphic form).</page><page sequence="2">1418 IHC : Proceedings , 68th Session, 2007 The former form was inscribed with several figures. Its four feet were the Vedas , its tusks the stakes to which the sacrificial animals were bound, its mouth the altar, its teeth the offspring, its tongue was the fire, the body hair darbha or the holy grass, its eyes were the symbols of day and night, its head was considered the seat of Brahma, its snout the ladle, its grunt was likened to the chant of Samaveda , and the body proper was the yajnasala 9 or the hall of sacrifice. In a way, the whole cosmos could be understood in terms of the varaha. The avatara bhuvaraha representation had a human body with a boar head. It always had Bhudevi seated either on the left shoulder or left elbow of varaha . Ill Artistic Portrayal: The portrayal of varaha raising the Earth from the nether world has been a favorite motif in Indian art. Historically, its earliest representation appeared in the Kushana period.10 Religiously, the association of Vishnu with the establishment of universal order by redeeming the Earth conferred a high religious sanctity on the varaha theme, especially, during the Gupta period. Politically, varaha became an eloquent symbol of the royal might of the hero who destroys the enemy, rescues the land from oppression and establishes dharma. Widely prevalent in northern India the varaha cult also made inroads into the south. Synonymous with political might, splendour and religious fervour it was adopted as the dynastic symbol of the Chalukya dynasty.11 IV Varaha in Chalukyan Art: With their rise to political power in the sixth century AD, the Chalukya rulers began to patronize artistic tendencies on a grand scale. The sites of Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal in particular became the hub of their art enterprises. Coupled with the creation of grandiose structural edifices were the carving out of rock-cut caves at Aihole and Badami. Those at the latter center are more noteworthy by dint of better conception, proportions and style of execution. Badami, in southeast Bijapur, in Karnataka served as an early capital of the Chalukyas. The site has four caves all hewn out of sandstone rock. Among them caves II and III12 consist of varaha portrayals. Cave III is the most ornate, impressive and largest of the early Chalukya excavations. It bears a dated inscription13 of king Mangalesha testifying to its being a royal dedication. The inscription</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology 1419 is placed next to a large sculpted relief of varaha rescuing the Earth. This placement was perhaps no coincidence. The varaha in addition to being their dynastic symbol also symbolized the Chalukyas' role as protectors of the earth. V Of the bhuvaraha and yajnavaraha forms the former was represented in Chalukya art. The portrayal in the mukhamandapa wall of cave II is located on the east, within a definite architectural frame and over dado gana panel. Its controlled relief exhibits the two-dimensional outlines predominating over the projection of the forms. The figure is in the pratyalidha pose, face one side with his left leg raised on to a lotus that rests on the coiling Nagaraja representing the sea below. Bhudevi stands on another lotus held in the varaha 's natural left hand and leans against his snout. His natural right hand rests on his hip. His second right hand held the chakra and second left hand held the sankha besides passing behind to support Bhudevi's body. Each element in the relief is shown clearly in profile or full front. The varaha in cave III exhibits a complex use of space. Its frame was the architecture of the cave, except for the dado gana panel. The pose is similar to that in cave II, the only difference being in the treatment of the left arms. The natural arm curves visibly behind Bhudevi to hold the sankha more explicitly than in cave II panel. The second left arm is not shown at all. It is rather indicated by the hand appearing out of the natural space of the panel to support Bhudevi's padmapitha . The plastic use of space is typical of the great sophistication found in the cave III style. Besides other comparisons the two panels exhibit the expertise gradually achieved by the Chalukyan sculptors. In stance and robustness they almost follow the Gupta specimens from Udaigiri and Eran.14 The Gupta dvibhuji naravaraha in alidhamudra generally had the left leg placed on seshanaga while the right leg was held tense and erect. Bhudevi was represented clinging to its tusks. Stylistically, however, certain novelties were noticeable in the Chalukya varaha figures. For instance, the figure wears a thick ratna yajnopavita , jeweled crown, holds a sankha and chakra in the additional upper hands while the lower right is in katyavalambita and the left holds a padmapitha for Bhudevi. Besides, Bhudevi is provided a support under her feet by varaha's lower left hand as prescribed by the Vishnudharmottara Purana . The sankha placement in the upper left hand behind her further consolidated her position. She stands gracefully while leaning towards</page><page sequence="4">1 420 IHC: Proceedings , 68th Session, 2007 the varaha' s snout or shoulder. The composition is more diagonal in cave II. Herein both varaha and Bhudevi are shown wearing mukuta unlike in cave III. Bhudevi also has a prabhavali. Varaha stands on a padmasana instead of seshanaga hoods as in cave III. His vanamala is also missing in cave II. The Varaha motif was also carved in the Aihole Ravanaphadi cave. There his foot did not rest on the padmasana or seshanaga. The left heel is raised from the ground in a dance like pose. His body seems to be more flat and slender. The sankha floats in the air without any visible support while the chakra is balanced on the fingertips. Further stylistic development in the motif may be visualized in the structural Durga temple at Aihole and in Makutesvara temple. Therein the chakra is held in two extended fingers as if in prayoga mudra while Bhudevi is comfortably perched on upper part of the varaha 's left arm folded at the elbow. Moreover, the varaha sniffing her with the snout reveals a subtle intimacy. The Badami cave III varaha comes closer to a sthanamurti ,15 that is a freestanding image with attendant devatas. Quite significantly in cave II the varaha is drawn back to a side with his right foot placed in the right corner providing him wide range for the stride. His head is bent downwards unlike in cave III. Bhudevi is shown reclining passively 16 rather than standing with erect head suggestive of triumph. This relief seems to portray varaha still in the midst of action. Composition-wise in cave III the action is fully centered on the varaha and is not contrasted by any other counter movement. All the surrounding figures are not only smaller in proportion to him but also display passive attitudes. Bhudevi herself, standing erect and vertical appears exactly in line with the upward surge of the varaha. Reaching only upto his snout she neither seems to# weigh down his head by resting an arm upon it nor disturbs his rising movement by any bend of her body. This portrayal offers a contrast to a similar motif in Chalukyan cave XIV at Ellora, wherein it is represented as a drama with all the figures plunging into action. Thus, we find variance in the execution of the varaha motif at Badami. The cave III figure suggests tranquility, triumph and tenderness whereas the cave II panel is full of physical action, dramatic content and dynamism. To the latter variety of portrayal may also be added the Chalukyan specimens at Aihole and Ellora. In addition to the full- fledged varaha portrayals, scenes of boar hunt17 illustrating the Kiratarjuniya 18 story may be noticed in the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal confirming the popularity of the motif in different forms.</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology 1421 This variety lends a distinct character to Chalukyan art. In a way, it marks an iconographie transition similar to their architectural styles as seen at the tripartite sites of Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal. This fact enables us to conclude that while the Chalukyan artists were well versed in Vedic and Silpa Sastriya texts they were also catering to their creative genius. Quite effectively they intertwined religious tenets with the political fervor through the medium of art and the varaha motif is the most significant testimony of this blending.
