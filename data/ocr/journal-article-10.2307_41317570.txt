June 2011. Vanilla orchids: Natural history and cultivation. Timber Press, Portland (www.timberpress.com). 212 pp., ill. (most col.), ISBN 9780881929898 HB, $34.95. - With intro (flavor, fragrance), 10 chaps, (origins, hist, domesticated va- nilla; evol., distr.; morph.; profiles select spp.; hybrids; relatives; cult, at home, in greenhouse; poll.; harvesting, processing; comm. products), checklists (curr. recognized spp.; idem arr. by continent; syns.), 5-p. biblio., 10-p. index. &lt; Vanilla is the most popular flavor and fragrance in the world. Because of this, "the word vanilla has become synonymous with plain, boring, white, common, ordinary, and flavorless" (p. 7). Ken Cameron's tour-de-force of a little book on the natural history, classification, cultiva- tion, and commercialization of Vanilla , especially V planifolia, shows that "vanilla" has been slandered. The introduction and ten chapters involve just 167 pages that include a gorgeous central gallery of 64 pages containing 140 mostly color photos. Because their captions are more detailed than usual, the gallery provides a splendid overview of vanilla. The main text is facile, though sometimes anthropomorphic, for example, "thirsty plants" on page 31. The terminology used is fairly straightforward. However, the lack of a glossary makes proper indexing of more unusual terms especially important. For instance, unindexed are "abscission," "velamen," and, surprisingly, "DNA" and "molecular biology/systematics." These quibbles will concern mainly the novice, but not more in- formed persons, including orchidophiles. The latter will appreciate the three detailed checklists: the 102 currently recognized species arranged alphabetically and geographically (Africa, Asia, North and South America), and synonymy - 22 pages in all. This superb book is a most informative read. - Rudolf Schmid, UC</page></plain_text>
