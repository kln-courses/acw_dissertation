<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONRAD AND THE POLITICS OF THE SUBLIME SANDRA DODSON The term vsublime,' in its Romantic sense, typically evokes the spectre of the eighteenth-century sage of Konigsberg, Immanuel Kant. At first sight the pre-Romantic German philosopher and Conrad, the writer of early modernist English fiction, seem an incongruous pair, and not only because of the centuries which separate them and the different idioms in which they wrote. Kant lectured at the University of Konigsberg, and, though he gave courses not only in philosophy, but also in physical geography for forty years, notoriously never travelled further than forty miles from his native town. It would be hard to think of a less likely secret sharer than Conrad, the sage of the seas turned writer, whose intimate knowledge of colonial Noutposts of progress' led him to speak scornfully of N armchair' explorers like Kant. Moreover, while Conrad alludes to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in his letters and essays, there is no conclusive evidence that he was familiar with Kantian aesthetics and philosophy. Yet if Conrad's pessimism about human nature, particularly the human will to power, and his recognition of the discursive, interpretative nature of reason and truth closely recall Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, his moral stoicism and the sublime, solipsistic cast of his aesthetics and politics situate him firmly in the tradition of Kant. Indeed, without denying that Conrad is indebted in significant ways to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, I believe that his work reveals a far more striking affinity with Romantic and pre-Romantic philosophy, notably that of Kant, than with the philosophy of the</page><page sequence="2">7 later nineteenth century. Forgetting for a while their superficial differences, Conrad and Kant share a profoundly Romantic preoccupation, not only with the relation between Man and Nature, but with crucially related questions of ethics, epistemology, and politics. From a contemporary critical vantage point one could say that for both writers the ideology of Nature is inseparable from the nature of Ideology, the complex topographies of human morality, thought and history. Moreover for both, whether overtly or covertly, the aesthetic discourses of the sublime and the beautiful are deeply implicated in these broader philosophical themes, and for both the aesthetics of the sublime take precedence over the beautiful, leaving us stranded in a dark, discomfiting world, drained of immanent meaning and value. Finally, as I will demonstrate, though Conrad's corrosive irony results in a more radically pessimistic view of human nature and history than Kant's, his didactic preoccupation with the question of vhow to be' signifies a deep nostalgia for Kant's transcendental moral Law, the v sovereign power' which salvages the Kantian sublime from its abyssal depths and redeems Kant's tragic politics. While these assertions may be irksome to critics who recognise the validity of literary-philosophical comparisons only where there is evidence of a direct influence, it is my belief that strictly empirical studies all too often lead into critical cul-de-sacs or peter out because of a paucity of reliable evidence. Moreover the idea of a connection between Conrad and Kant is not as outlandish or conceited as it may at first seem. Conrad himself remarks that, at his public school in Austrian Cracow, historical studies were naturally tinted with Germanism' ,* while Eloise Knapp Hay suggests that Conrad's childhood exposure to German historiography had a 1 Conrad, letter to George T.

Given the influence of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on Conrad, it is also worth noting that Kant was the philosophical forefather of Schopenhauer, whose idea of an unfathomable, malevolent Will, a pessimistic travesty of the Kantian Ding-an-sich, can in turn be traced in Nietzsche's ideas of the will to power and the death of God. Thus far I have omitted what would seem the most plausible route of Kantian vinfluence' on Conrad, namely, the culture of Polish Romanticism. Primarily as a result of the Austro-Prussian occupation of a large part of Poland after the first partition in 1772, late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Polish culture was permeated by German literature and philosophy, and, as numerous critical studies have shown, Polish Romantic playwrights and poets like Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Sfowacki and Zygmunt Krasinski had an important influence on Conrad's work and temperament.3 Given that Kant, whose philosophy played a significant part in the broader tradition of European Romanticism, was himself Prussian, and since, moreover, Polish Romanticism retained much of the 2 Eloise Knapp Hay writes: v Conrad was deprecating in his references to these German historians, but their tracks are evident in his political fiction'.

Yet what emerges is a very different scenario. For specific ideological reasons, which I shall explore shortly, the Prussian philosopher was invariably marginalised in favour of high Romantic German writers like Hegel, Goethe and Schiller. Although the latter's early work, particularly his essay On the Sublime', reproduces many of Kant's central ideas, Schiller's Kantian writings appear to have had less influence in Poland than his later, resolutely idealist poetry, plays, and aesthetics. If, from an empirical point of view, the Konigsberger's subordinate status in Polish Romanticism seems a drawback for the present study, I believe that, paradoxical as it may seem, the Polish suppression of the Kantian sublime is of crucial importance in relation to Conrad's politics and aesthetics. In 4 Initially I surmised that, although Kant was not fully assimilated into the Polish literary-philosophical tradition, the idea of the sublime may nevertheless have entered Polish culture via other works of the European Enlightenment. Mitosz mentions that the seventeenth-century French critic, Boileau, whose translation of Longinus's Peri Hypsous was largely responsible for popularising the idea of rhetorical sublimity in England and Europe, was widely read and translated by Enlightenment writers and critics in Poland. See Czesfaw Mitosz, The History of Polish Literature (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969), hereafter Miiosz, HPL; p. 158, p. 181. Moreover, The Monitor magazine, founded in 1765, was closely modelled upon the London Spectator, which throughout the 1760s published criticism indebted to Burke's philosophy of the sublime in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. See Mifbsz, p. 162. However, in a recent letter to me, Dr. Tadeusz Rachwal comments that, despite a tendency toward sublime obscurity and excess in much Polish literature, the sublime never took firm root as an aesthetic concept in Poland. To corroborate this he points out that, although Longinus's rhetorical treatise on the sublime was finally translated into Polish in the nineteenth century, vthe word used as an equivalent (gornosc) was not a happy one'. Dr. Tadeusz Sfawek similarly remarks in recent correspondence that, although I am right in my intuition regarding the dark, alienated, anti Hegelian side of Polish Romanticism, this was never formally articulated as an aesthetics of sublimity in Polish literary-philosophical discourse.</page><page sequence="5">10 the discussion that follows I will show that his uncanny ability to speak the unspeakable, to articulate the sublime v heart of darkness', not only of Polish culture, but of human nature and history, has a profoundly Kantian resonance. Conrad's father, Apollo Korzeniowski, a political activist, translator and late Romantic playwright, was an ardent reader of Mickiewicz, and at an early age Conrad was introduced to works such as Forefathers' Eve, Konrad Wallenrod, Grazyna and Pan Tadeusz. In a famous interview with Marian D^browski Conrad recalls: English critics ? and after all I am an English writer ? whenever they speak of me they add that there is in me something incomprehensible, inconceivable, elusive. Only you can grasp this elusiveness, and comprehend what is incomprehensible. That is Polishness. Polishness which I took from Mickiewicz and Sfowacki. My father read Pan Tadeusz aloud to me and made me read it aloud. Not just once or twice. I used to prefer Konrad Wallenrod, Grazyna. Later I liked Slowacki better. You know why Slowacki? // est Vame de toute la Pologne, lui.5 If this v incomprehensible, inconceivable, elusive' thing in Conrad's writing is the true signature of his Polishness, it is also, unmistakeably, the signature of the Kantian sublime. Indeed, Conrad's suggestion that English critics lack an aesthetic framework within which to make sense of his elusiveness and, dialectically, Comprehend what is incomprehensible' amounts to a reflection on his own belatedly romantic sublimity, for the definitive feature of the negative Kantian sublime (as opposed to the Wordsworthian egotistical or positive sublime) is the ambiguous collapse and restoration of meaning in the face of the ungraspable, the indistinct, 5 Marian D^browski, vAn Interview with J. Conrad', in Zdzislaw Najder (ed.), Conrad Under Familial Eyes, tr.

In the pre-Romantic work of Kant the sublime is articulated as a definitively modern aesthetics of alienation from Nature, and resonates thus through the literary philosophical culture of European Romanticism. In the aesthetic sphere of the Romantic sublime, meaning seems no longer centripetal and sensuous, but abstract and centrifugal, or, in Thomas Weiskel's terms, Nnegative, dialectical, a movement between two states, an indeterminate relation' (/?S, p. 43). Weiskel provides a literary-historical context for the sublime as a disruption of meaning and sensuous experience, a breakdown of the unity which had underpinned and sustained the aesthetic, as well as moral and political, ideology of the Enlightenment: [I]n the history of literary consciousness the sublime revives as God withdraws from an immediate participation in the experience of men. The secondary or problematic sublime is pervaded by the nostalgia and uncertainty of minds involuntarily secular ? minds whose primary experience is shaped by their knowledge and perception of secondary causes, (pp. 3-4) Accordingly, Weiskel suggests, the secular, alienated mode of the sublime is incompatible with the idealist's faith in the meaning or efficacy of political praxis. In contrast with the vrevolutionary program of beauty', he argues, the detached, spectatorial stance of the sublime is invariably N missing in the aesthetics of activists and idealists.... '7 Weiskel has little more to say on the negative political 6 See Thomas Weiskel, vThe Ethos of Alienation: Two Versions of Transcendence', The Romantic Sublime: Studies in the Structure and Psychology of Transcendence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986), hereafter Weiskel, RS\ pp. 34-62. 7 RS, p. 46. Weiskel elaborates that vthe sublime, lacking a ground in external reality, comes into play precisely insofar as man cannot attain the totality; the intensity of the sublime experience is a direct function of the (continued...)</page><page sequence="7">12 implications of the sublime. Yet his idea of a stillborn politics is particularly apt in the context of Polish Romanticism, where the sphere of the aesthetic is ridden with the contradiction between a fervent ethos of revolutionary nationalism on the one hand and a tragic reality of revolutionary failure on the other. The disastrous outcome of three successive nationalist uprisings in occupied Poland led to a pervasive, culturally-specific sense of God's withdrawal from the human world, and seemed an outrageous betrayal of the popular messianic idea of Poland's historical destiny.8 Indeed, it is interesting in this context that the Messianist poet-philosopher, Mickiewicz, criticises not only Siowacki's de-idealised politics, but also his early poetry, which he describes as technically impressive, but empty, like Na church without God inside'.9 Tensions between a providential or messianic philosophy of history and an inadmissible scepticism about its political efficacy are 7 (...continued) impossibility of realising (in any way) the idea of humanity (or any supersensible idea' (p. 45). 8 The politics of Polish nationalism determined the almost obsessive prominence of questions of national identity, moral duty and political destiny in the literature, philosophy and historiography of the period. The dominant philosophy of Hegelian idealism reinforced the ideology of Polish Messianism, fervently promulgated by the philosophers August Cieszkowski and Bronisfaw Trentowski, by the political mystics Hoene Wronski, Andrzej Towianski and his poetic disciple, Adam Mickiewicz, and later by Apollo Korzeniowski. According to the messianic myth the people of Poland were the national incarnation of Christ, the martyr among the nations of Europe, destined to rise up and overthrow foreign domination on the v third day1, the prophesied occasion of the third nationalist rebellion. The failure of the 1863 uprising, upon which activists like Apollo Korzeniowski had staked their hopes, led to widespread disillusionment with the doctrine of Messianism, and reinforced a conservative counter-current in Polish political philosophy. See Andrzej Walicki, Philosophy and Romantic Nationalism: The Case of Poland (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982), H. G. Schenk, The Mind of the European Romantics (London: Constable, 1966), pp. 187-194, and the introduction to Harold B. Segel's Polish Romantic Drama: Three Plays in English Translation (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977). 9 Adam Mickiewicz, in Milosz, HPL, p. 233.</page><page sequence="8">13 evident not only in the political philosophy, but also in the literature of the period. S-fowacki is an interesting case in point. Although, in theory, the younger poet and polemicist advocated social revolution as the only viable means to achieve Polish liberation, he remained sceptical of Romantic Messianism, and unceremoniously rejected the notion of Committed art'. Subversive themes of political betrayal, defeat and disengagement in his work served as a deliberate counter to Mickiewicz's idealistic nationalism and the messianic idea of the providential man*. In the verse-drama Kordian (written in ironic response to Mickiewicz's Forefathers' Eve III) the Warsaw insurgents emerge, despite their revolutionary elan, as a politically unsophisticated mob betrayed by incompetent leaders, while in lieu of the providential Romantic hero, we find a protagonist whose moral scruples and neurotic self-consciousness fatally undermine his ability to act. After an abortive attempt to assassinate the Czar, Kordian is committed to an insane asylum and condemned to death. Subjected to the same uncompromising irony, the conflictual stances of revolutionary activism and an historically entrenched moral conservatism fail to provide political solutions. Significantly, Stowacki's propensity for political satire coincides with formal strategies of narrative fragmentation, obfuscation and self-irony, producing what Claude Backvis describes as v amazing literary cocktails'.10 The incongruous medley of genres and historical epochs in Balladyna, for example, produces a bathetic, mock-heroic effect reminiscent of Pope's Dunciad, in which linguistic decorum is similarly violated, and words and meanings threaten to spin apart entirely. Another apt comparison is Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, in which the v Clothes-philosopher' Teufelsdrockh's colossal work, vDie Kleider, Ihr Werden und Werken' is similarly described as a vmad banquet, wherein all courses had been confounded'.11 It is fitting that Slowacki's aesthetics have therefore been designated sublimely Centrifugal' rather than Centripetal', a tendency demonstrated not only in the ironic bathos of Balladyna, 10 Claude Backvis, in Milosz, HPL, p. 233. 11 Thomas Carlyle, Sartor Resartus (London: Dent, 1908), Book I, Chapter V, p. 25.</page><page sequence="9">14 but in an obfuscatory, allegorical style which, in Mtfosz's words, ' dissolves every object into a.. .fluid maze of images and sonorities' and frequently leads to 'nearly automatic writing'.12 Stowacki's work anticipates not only the sublime obscurity of Nietzsche and the later French Symbolists, as Mtfosz suggests, but the characteristic elusiveness, indeterminacy and narrative discontinuity of Conrad's fiction, which Ian Watt similarly defines as 'centrifugal' rather than 'centripetal'.13 Indeed, from this perspective we are able to appreciate more fully Conrad's preference for Stowacki's often sublime, or, conversely, bathetic, art, over Mickiewicz's more consistent political and aesthetic idealism. Throughout Conrad's work we witness the same ambivalent assertion and interrogation of the immanentist or '"ideal" value of things, events and people',14 the same coincidence of a de-idealised politics with a sublimely obfuscatory poetics. At this point, therefore, I leave the literary historical context of Conrad and Polish Romanticism, to explore in depth his relation to the poetics and politics of the Kantian sublime. The consolatory aesthetics of the beautiful and the bleak, stoical discourse of the sublime are the foundations upon which both Kant and Conrad's political philosophies rest, and this means that a discussion of the politics of the sublime cannot proceed without a 12 Miiosz, HPL, pp. 242-243. Slowacki's 'automatic writing' sounds uncannily like the postmodern textual sublime. I am reminded here of Fredric Jameson's remarks on Conrad in The Political Unconscious: VA case could be made for reading Conrad not as an early modernist, but rather as an anticipation of that later and quite different thing we have come to call variously textuality, ecriture, post-modernism, or schizophrenic writing.

Here everything is what it seems, for reading the world and seeing the world amount to the same thing: meaning is coherently embodied in the beautiful, symmetrical forms of Nature, and we need only read Nature's signs to take our moral and epistemological bearings in the world. Nature seems exquisitely adapted to the contours of the human mind, uniquely designed to suit our needs. And from the idea of a beautifully contained (and reassuringly containable) natural world, we are naturally led to faith in a beneficent Creator and to a charitable view of our fellow beings. The beautiful is therefore a kind of theodicy, a source of hope and consolation. Nature is made over in our own image, and we can rest reassured that the world is, after all, a place we can call home. But there is no doubt that Kant regards the beautiful as a form of symbolic mystification, in which immanent meaning is artificially and retrospectively attributed to a vast, unknowable and wholly indifferent world, the shadowy realm of the Ding-an-sich or vthing in-itself'. In the sublime, by contrast, we are forced to acknowledge the incongruity between Nature and our humanising projections, are reminded that we construct our meanings alone in the world and have no recourse to a moral or semantic ground outside ourselves. For Kant, like Schiller ? and Conrad ? after him, human beings are therefore unhappy, self-conscious artists, who must stoically 15 William Booth demonstrates brilliantly how the premises of the sublime and beautiful pervade Kant's political thinking in Interpreting the World: Kant's Philosophy of History and Politics (London: University of Toronto Press, 1986), hereafter Booth, IW; Booth's analysis is particularly illuminating in the context of Polish Romanticism, where the sphere of the aesthetic is everywhere overshadowed by a predominant interest in political and moral matters. 16 Immanuel Kant, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, tr. J.T. Goldthwait (Berkeley : University of California Press, 1960), hereafter Kant, BS; p. 47.</page><page sequence="11">16 forge meanings out of a scattered, incoherent reality. From the sublime standpoint Nature shows a shocking irregularity and contingency in its workings, appearing dark, immense, formless, violent, a realm of blind chance rather than Providential necessity. Any aspect of Nature which suggests Ideas of Infinity or excessive power is for Kant sublime, and he refers specifically to violent storms, volcanoes, hurricanes, darkness, objects devoid of form, the Milky Way and the ocean as a boundless expanse or a restless, threatening abyss. If natural beauty relies on an ideology of vision and legibility, form and limitation, the sublime is an aesthetics of darkness, formlessness and indeterminacy: KDie Nacht ist erhaberf (Kant, BS, p. 47). While the beautiful provides us with a guiding narrative thread, the consolation of Providential design or metaphysical teleology, in the abyssal formlessness of the sublime no design or Designer is evident, and we are denied the consolation of a world made in our own image, a v speaking face of Nature'17 which would tell us a reassuring tale and restore our moral and psychic bearings. Instead we are reminded of our dwarfish insignificance in relation to a Nature that exceeds and defeats comprehension, that can be read and re-read, but never known/seen. For Kant, this is tantamount to the threat of self-annihilation: vThe point of excess for the imagination...is like an abyss in which it fears to lose itself, he writes in The Critique of Judgement. Later in the Critique, remarking on the fact that, from the sublime point of view, Nature fails to reward moral worth, so that the just suffer equally with the evil, he writes, v And so it will continue to be until one wide grave engulfs them all ? just and unjust, there is no distinction in the grave ? and hurls them back into the abyss of the 17 The expression is Wordsworth's in Book 5 of The Prelude.

The 'unmistakable and ineffaceable idea of morality' remains, he concludes, even 'when nothing any longer meets the eye of sense'.19 If the sublime violates teleological purposiveness in Nature, by the same ingenious, but perhaps disingenuous, stroke it reveals a different kind of purposiveness, a moral purposiveness in the subject. The terror of incomprehension therefore gives way to a pleasurable intuition of the sublimity of the moral Law within us, a law which lifts us above the dominion of nature and 'evidences a faculty of mind transcending every standard of sense' (C7, p. 98). Yet if this should fail, he writes, 'nothingness (immorality) with gaping throat, would drink the whole kingdom of (moral) beings like a drop of water'.20 It is not difficult to detect echoes of this warning in the famous words of Nietzsche's madman in The Gay Science: 18 Kant, The Critique of Judgement, tr. James Creed Meredith (Oxford: Clarendon, 1992), hereafter Kant, CJ; p. 107, p. 121. Cf Schiller: vThen away with falsely construed forbearance and vapidly effeminate taste which cast a veil over the solemn face of necessity and, in order to curry favour with the senses, counterfeit a harmony between good fortune and good behaviour of which not a trace is to be found in the actual world. Let us stand face to face with the evil fatality.' Friedrich Schiller, vOn the Sublime', in Naive and Sentimental Poetry and On the Sublime: Two Essays, tr. Julius A.

Gregor (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), hereafter Kant, DV; p. 448. The moral Law is always already threatened in Kant by the possibility of engulfment and defeat. In the Critique of Judgement he writes: v [W]ithout the development of moral ideas, that which, thanks to preparatory culture, we call sublime, merely strikes the untutored man as terrifying. He will see in the evidences which the ravages of nature give of her dominion, and in the vast scale of her might, compared with which his own is diminished to insignificance, only the misery, peril and distress that would compass the man who was thrown to its mercy' (CJ, p. 115).</page><page sequence="13">18 v Where has God gone?' he cried. I shall tell you! We have killed him, ? you and I! We are all his murderers! But how have we done this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away from all suns? Are we not perpetually falling? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing?21 Against this background I would like to turn to Conrad, and to suggest that Kant's speculation on the potential subversion of the sovereign power of moral Ideas anticipates not only the Nietzschean death of God, but the definitively secular mode of the Conradian sublime. In Conrad the redemptive intervention of a transcendent morality never comes, except in ironic, demystified form. Consider these famously pessimistic remarks in A Personal Record and in his letters to Cunninghame Graham, in which an uneasy, late Victorian sense of the contingency of consciousness and morality (the legacy of Darwin and Nietzsche) is assimilated into a discourse of de idealised sublimity: What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it.... We can't return to nature, since we can't change our place in it.... There is no morality, no knowledge and no hope; there is only the consciousness of ourselves which drives us about a world that whether seen in a convex or a concave mirror is always but a vain and floating appearance. Of course reason is hateful ? but why? Because it demonstrates (to those who have the courage) that we, living, are out of life ? utterly out of it.... Life knows us not and we do not know life ? we don't know even our own thoughts. Half the words we use have no meaning whatever and of the other half each man understands each word after the fashion of his own folly and conceit. Faith is a myth and beliefs shift like mists on the shore.... 21 Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, tr. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Random House, 1974), hereafter Nietzsche, GS; p. 125.</page><page sequence="14">19 Would you seriously wish to tell.. .a man: v Know thyself.' Understand that thou art nothing, less than a shadow, more insignificant than a drop of water in the ocean, more fleeting than the illusion of a dream. Would you? The ethical view of the universe involves us at last in so many cruel and absurd contradictions, where the last vestiges of faith, hope, charity, and even of reason itself, seem ready to perish, that I have come to suspect that the aim of creation cannot be ethical at all. I would fondly believe that its object is purely spectacular: a spectacle for awe, love, adoration or hate....22 If Conrad in A Personal Record finally sounds a note of optimism, arguing thatv [t]hose visions, delicious or poignant, are a moral end in themselves', that the appointed task of the writer is to bear testimony to v the haunting terror, the infinite passion.. .the supreme law and the abiding mystery of the sublime spectacle" (PR, p. 92), this is the beleaguered optimism of someone who has no recourse to moral absolutes. Conrad's 'supreme law' is only a tenuous, secular remnant of the sovereign power of the Kantian moral Law, painfully aware of its arbitrary, de-idealised status. Moreover Conrad's attitude here represents something more like stoicism than the optimism one associates with Nietzsche's celebration of the end of ethics, the transvaluation of all values. As further testimony to his Kantian temperament, Conrad remains incapable of the yea saying with which the Nietzschean Overman celebrates his new found freedom from the moral Law in a universe devoid of anthropomorphic vafterworlds and false divinities'.23 This is particularly evident in Conrad's fiction, where the solace of an objective moral ground is consistently denied, and Nature, far from 22 Conrad, letters to Cunninghame Graham, 31 January 1898, 14 January 1898, 14 December 1897, in C.T.

In Heart of Darkness, for example, the sinister backdrop of the jungle is Nimmense', vimpenetrable to human thought', vpitiless to human weakness', profoundly subversive of the luminosity and readability of the beautiful (HD, p. 136, p. 127). Moreover, as in Kant, the image of the abyss in Conrad repeatedly conveys a sense of the world experienced as absence, aporia, signification without significance: v A brooding gloom lay over this vast and monotonous landscape; the light fell on it as if into an abyss' (ZJ, p. 264), he writes in Lord Jim. In a self-reflexive, post-Kantian move, the topos of sublime, abyssal landscapes in Conrad is always already a simulacrum of the emptiness underlying all discursive, ideological constructs. Conrad's descriptions of a shadowy, illegible, non-signifying Nature in works like The Nigger of the ^Narcissus', Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim invariably coincide with an obsesssive preoccupation with the failure of language to signify truths or, in the famous words of the 1897 Preface to The Nigger of the ^Narcissus', vto make you see' (NN, p. xlii). Everywhere the visual and the verbal, the ungraspable sublimity of Nature and the sublime indeterminacy of the sign, are conflated, so that, quite contrary to the promises of the Preface (perhaps an unwieldy attempt by Conrad to insert himself into an English aesthetic tradition?),24 we are precluded from seeing and 24 I would argue that David Thorburn in Conrad's Romanticism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), pp. 149-152, and Ian Watt in CNC, pp. 78-81, erroneously take Conrad's Preface at face value, and detect significant affinities between Conrad's aesthetic claims and those of Wordsworth in his Preface to Lyrical Ballads. Avoiding the problematical relation between the visionary aspects of Wordsworth's aesthetics and Conrad's secularised theory of artistic vision, neither Watt nor Thorburn sees any disjunction between the Prefaces. Michael Jones, in Conrad's Heroism: A Paradise Lost (Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press, 1985), more appositely compares Wordsworth's Preface to Conrad's primarily to illustrate vthe historical displacement... and the despiritualization of... romanticism in Conrad' s fiction" (p. xviii). He argues: NFor all its questing after the Beautiful and the True, (continued...)</page><page sequence="16">21 knowing by an obscurity which is as pervasively rhetorical as it is thematic. The reader's sensation of visual, semantic, and, above all, moral failure, therefore has to do not only with the de-idealised sublimity of Conrad's land- and sea-scapes, but with the secular sublimity of language as an opaque, interpretative construct. Consistently we encounter Marlow and frame-narrators like him, thwarted by the difficulties of representation, baffled before an epistemological abyss which denies any possibility of narrative rendering and moral and semantic closure. As Marlow says of Kurtz: He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything?\HD, p. 82). Again, however, if Conrad's recognition of the linguistic, interpretative predicament in which we find ourselves has Nietzschean, or even, one might say, de Manian, overtones, it lacks the celebratory confidence with which Nietzsche's Overman is able to assert: In what a marvellous and new and at the same time terrible and ironic relationship with the totality of existence do I feel myself to stand with my knowledge!...I have suddenly awoken in the midst of this dream, but only to the consciousness that I am dreaming and that I have to go on dreaming in order not to be destroyed: as the sleepwalker has to go on dreaming in order not to fall .... [A]mong all these dreamers, I, too, the vman of knowledge', dance my dance.... (GS, p. 206) If Nietzsche's Overman sleepwalks joyously on a tightrope of human metaphors, for Conrad an ironic consciousness of the dream, or even a momentary glimpse of the abyss, tends to be fatal, as the deaths of Decoud and Kurtz testify. Moreover, while it would be true to say that the philosopher-narrator Marlow agrees to live the lie of language in a gesture of Nietzschean forgetfulness, to vlie 24 (...continued) the romanticism of the Preface in the Wordsworthian sense of that term rests upon a foundation of outdated cliches and platitudes rescued from a century of progressive skepticism' (p. 36).</page><page sequence="17">22 according to a fixed convention...in a style binding for all',25 his negative knowledge coincides with a deep nostalgia for moral and semantic authority, the sovereign truth behind the inconclusive flux of discursive interpretations. More importantly in this context, if Nietzsche regards the will to ignorance as a partial means of avoiding the malady of historical knowledge ('the antidotes to the historical are called ? the unhistorical and the superhistorical.... By the word 'the unhistorical' I denote the art and the strength of being able to forget and enclose oneself in a limited horizon'),26 for Conrad, the problem of human history is not so easily erased. In the historical/political sphere the deflated idealism of the Conradian sublime, or what amounts to a contradictory condemnation of Nietzschean forgetfulness and an acknowledgement of the tragic futility of historical action, leads to a serious ideological impasse. What is at stake is not only the Grand Narrative of human history, but, by extension, the form of the historical novel itself. Nietzsche was not the first to challenge the authority of historical knowledge. Kant before him had subjected the teleological assumptions of philosophical history to a radical critique under the aegis of the sublime 'Ideas of human justice,' and it is therefore to Kant's philosophy of history and politics that I now turn. As I will demonstrate, a reading of Conrad's politics proves enormously profitable in the light of a post-Kantian articulation of the beautiful and the sublime with a mystified history on the one hand and a demystified politics on the other. If Conrad's aesthetics take us to the ' threshold of the invisible', his politics likewise lead us ' beyond the pale' into a space which defies representation. Far from being a politics of destiny, a Utopian politics of vision, this is a politics of blindness and obftiscation, an unrepresentable politics, in short, a politics of the sublime. As William Booth demonstrates brilliantly in his Interpreting the 25 Nietzsche quoted in the translator's preface to Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, tr.

Peter Preuss (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1980), p. 62.</page><page sequence="18">23 World: Kant's Philosophy of History and Politics, Kant's theory of philosophical history is deeply imbued with the ideological presuppositions of the beautifiil. Just as the beautiful forms of Nature assume attributes of identity and purposiveness, reciprocity and design, so, from the philosophical historian's stance, the course of human history is a teleological movement, each moment of which symbolises, contains within itself, the telos of Destiny. While philosophical history provides what Kant describes as a ' consoling view of the future', a vsweet dream' of progress,27 in which even war and the bloody facts of history seem providential, the politics of the sublime coincide with a deeply pessimistic, non-teleological view. For Kant, as for Schiller, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche after him, the ahistorical perspective coincides with a view of history as wholly chaotic, contingent and amoral, devoid of any guiding teleological thread which would justify the atrocities of war and revolution in the name of world-historical progress (what Adorno refers to sceptically as Hegel's 'world-historic derring-do').28 Yet, unlike Nietzsche, for whom the end of history signifies the emergence of an exhilarating, amoral' eternal recurrence',29 in Kant the transcendent Infinity of the moral Reason finally redeems both the misguided optimism of philosophical history and the secular negativity of the sublime point of view. Indeed, while the consolatory aesthetics of the beautiful typically coincide with a fanatical, visionary politics, the negative, sceptical aesthetics of the sublime lead to a conservative political perspective, in which the idea of morality 'precludes all positive presentation' and therefore remains aloof from political praxis. For this reason Kant resists the 27 Kant, On the Old Saw: That May Be Right in Theory But It Won't Work in Practice', and v An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly Progressing?', in Booth, IW, p. 107. 28 Theodor Adorno, Negative Dialectics, transl.

In the same section Zarathustra announces, joyously, vMy abyss speaks, I have turned my ultimate depth into the light' (p. 233).</page><page sequence="19">24 visionary tradition in Romantic philosophy: This pure, elevating, merely negative presentation of morality involves... no fear of fanaticism, which is a delusion that would will some VISION beyond all the bounds of sensibility; i.e. would dream according to principles (rational raving).... For the inscrutability of the idea of freedom precludes all positive presentation. If enthusiasm is comparable to delirium, fanaticism may be compared to mania. Of these the latter is least of all compatible with the sublime, for it is profoundly ridiculous. (CJ, p. 128) It is worth recalling that, although Conrad has no redeeming faith in the authority of the moral Law, such fanaticism is for him equally untenable. In A Personal Record he writes: I have not been revolutionary in my writings. The revolutionary spirit is mighty convenient in this, that it frees one from all scruples as regards ideas. Its hard, absolute optimism is repulsive to my mind by the menace of fanaticism and intolerance it contains. No doubt one should smile at these things; but, imperfect Esthete, I am no better Philosopher. All claim to special righteousness awakens in me that scorn and anger from which a philosophical mind should be free.... (PR, pp. xxi-xxii) In this regard Conrad is much closer to Kant than he is to Rousseau, about whom he disparagingly remarks in the same text: N [Rousseau] was an artless moralist, as is clearly demonstrated by his anniversaries being celebrated with marked emphasis by the heirs of the French Revolution, which was not a political movement at all, but a great outburst of morality' (PR, p. 95). Remarks like these reverberate with Kantian echoes. Indeed, while Conrad's conservative politics have often been discussed in relation to Edmund Burke, it is worth noting that, while Burke's anti revolutionary Reflections on the Revolution in France marks a rejection of the dangerous excesses of the sublime and an endorsement of the order and sociability of the beautiful, for Conrad and Kant it is all too often the beautiful which incites a</page><page sequence="20">25 dangerously fanatical politics in the first place.30 The example of Burke's anti-revolutionism allows for an important caveat, namely, that I am not seeking to identify Conrad with Kant on the general grounds of their political conservatism. The crucial point is that, in Conrad and in Kant, a sublime aesthetics becomes virtually coterminous with a detached, spectatorial politics. Kant expresses the view that while the French Revolution appears to the philosophical historian as a beautiful 'historical sign' revealing the unfolding teleological progress of the race, the same events, from the stance of the 'Ideas of Justice', fill the soul only with 'horror'. The philosophical historian's 'wishful participation' in the 'game of great revolutions' is therefore, in sublime terms, dangerously deluded.31 The future, from this perspective, looks to be a senseless and violent repetition of the past or, worse still, a further decline. In his story of the innkeeper's sign in 'Perpetual Peace', Kant satirises the visionary dreamers, the philosophical millenarians, who, oblivious of history's bloody reproach, arouse great hopes by speaking of beautiful cities to come. The sign depicts, not the usual cluster of grapes or kegs, but the gloomy 30 Recognising that the dark, asocial, potentially anarchic qualities of the sublime could, inadvertently, serve to promote a revolutionary ethos which might in turn destroy the hegemony of the middle class, Burke, in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), deliberately sets out to counteract his aesthetic endorsement of sublimity in the Enquiry. See Tom Furniss, Edmund Burke's Aesthetic Ideology: Language, Gender and Political Economy in Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). 31 Kant, in vAn Old Question Raised Again' and The Metaphysical Elements of Justice, in Booth, IW, pp. 121-122. For the conservative Kant, war and revolution by definition subvert legality, and therefore cannot be justified within a legalistic framework of political Right. Crucially, then, the politics of the sublime amount to a wholesale rejection of political praxis, because the latter is predicated on a beautiful, visionary ideology which turns words into deeds, belief into action, reading into seeing. Cf Conrad in v Autocracy and War', Notes on Life and Letters: v There can be no evolution out of a grave. Another word of less scientific sound has been very much pronounced of late in connection with Russia's future, a word of more vague import, a word of dread as much as of hope - Revolution' (MX, p. 99).</page><page sequence="21">26 scene of a graveyard, above which appears the anomalous title, 'Perpetual Peace'. In 'Autocracy and War' Conrad expresses a similarly subversive, pessimistic view: ' [I]t must be confessed that the architectural aspect of the universal city remains as yet inconceivable ? that the very ground for its erection has not been cleared of the jungle' (NLL, p. 107). There are other marked affinities between Conrad and Kant. From the sublime point of view, society seems constantly threatened from within by the innate human capacity for evil and unbridled egotism. While the philosophical historian sees the antagonistic basis of society, or what Kant calls the principle of 'unsociable sociability',32 as an invigorating source of strife necessary to the advancement of culture, the same thing looks like a precariously contained anarchy from the perspective of the sublime. ' One cannot suppress a certain indignation', Kant writes, when one looks at human affairs. Here on the great 'world stage' what do we see but childish vanity, evil and destructiveness: 'Falsehood, ingratitude, injustice, the childishness of the purposes regarded by ourselves as important.. .in the pursuit of which men inflict upon one another all imaginable evils, are so contradictory to the idea of what men might be...that, in order that we may not hate them we withdraw from all contact with them'.33 Conrad's famously pessimistic remarks on human nature in his essays and letters sound a similar note: 'To him whose indignation is qualified by a measure of hope and affection, the efforts of mankind to work its own salvation present a sight of alarming comicality', he writes in 'Autocracy and War', for the 'intellectual stage of mankind [is] as yet in its infancy' (NLL, p. 108). And in a letter to Cunninghame Graham: 'We can't return to nature, since we can't change our place in it. Our refuge is in stupidity, in drunken[n]ess of all kinds, in lies, in beliefs, in murder, thieving, reforming ? in negation, in contempt ? each man according to the 32 Kant, xIdea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View,' in Booth, IW, p. 104. 33 Kant, vIdea for a Universal History', and The Critique of Judgement, in Booth, IW, pp. 99-100.</page><page sequence="22">27 promptings of his particular devil'.34 Moreover his decidedly un English view of democracy as a vlovely phantom', and his conviction that human society has its origins less in fraternity than in the conflicts of human egoism, has a striking affinity, not only with Hobbes, but with the Unsociable sociability' of Kant's tragic politics: N L'homme est un animal mechant. Sa mechancete doit etre organisee.... La societe est essentielment criminelle ? ou elle n'existerait pas.... C'est comme une foret ou personne ne connait la route'.35 Like Kant, Conrad therefore lays a heavier onus on organised society than on man, in whom he has little faith, yet this tense equilibrium of community and anarchy is a precarious one indeed: v C'est un egoisme rational et feroce que j'exerce envers moi meme. Je me repose la-dedans. Puis la pensee revient. La vie recommence, les regrets, les souvenirs et un desespoir plus sombre que la nuit' (LCG, p. 117; CLII, p. 160). Again, this recalls Kant: The principle of mutual love admonishes men constantly to come nearer to each other; that of the respect which they owe each other, to keep themselves at a distance from one another. And should one of these great moral forces fail, vthen nothingness (immorality) with gaping throat, would drink the whole kingdom of moral beings like a drop of water. (DV, p. 448) But perhaps Conrad's most striking affinity with a Kantian politics of sublimity lies in the contradictory combination of satiric, spectatorial detachment and moral dignity which he assumes in the face ofN the vast panorama of anarchy and futility'36 which is human history: The earth is a temple where there is going on a mystery play childish and poignant, ridiculous and awful enough, in all conscience.

I have not degraded the quasi religious sentiment by tears and groans; and if I have been amused or indignant I've neither grinned nor gnashed my teeth. In other words I've tried to write with dignity, not out of regard for myself but for the sake of the spectacle, the play with an obscure beginning and an unfathomable denouement?1 Kant, too, conjures the picture of a stagnant, Sisyphean history in which action threatens to become farce, but argues that respect (Achtung) for the human race requires that we avert our eyes from this undignified drama and concentrate instead on humanity's moral worth. Indeed, Kant cannot countenance the notion of a never ending play that will go on in the same way ad infinitum. In his essay, On the Old Saw', he writes: vTo watch this tragedy for a while may perhaps be touching and instructive, but eventually the curtain has to fall. For in the long run the tragedy becomes a farce, and though the actors, fools that they are, do not tire of it, the spectator will'.38 For both Kant and Conrad this sublime spectacle accordingly leaves us, in Kant's words, with the moral problem of what v one must be in order to be a man'. (Note here the echoes of Stein in Lord Jim, on the question of show to be'.)39 In Kant's 37 Conrad, letter to Arthur Symons, 29 August 1908, LL II, pp. 83-84, CLIV, pp. 113-114. 38 Kant, On the Old Saw', hereafter Kant, OOS, in Booth, IW, p. 100. Cf Schopenhauer's more intense pessimism: x [0]ur life must contain all the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of tragic characters, but, in the broad detail of life, are inevitably the foolish characters of a comedy'.

Cf Vol. 2, p. 357: v[N]o one has the remotest idea why the tragi-comedy exists, for it has no spectators, and the actors themselves undergo endless worry with little and merely negative enjoyment'. 39 Kant, OOS, p. 124. Cf Stein in Lord Jim: v "One thing alone can us from being ourselves cure!" ... There was a pause. "Yes," said I, "strictly speaking, the question is not how to get cured, but how to live." He approved with his head, a little sadly as it seemed. "Ja! Jal... That is the question...." He went on nodding sympathetically.... "How to be! Ach\ How to be'" (pp. 212-213).</page><page sequence="24">29 philosophy the politics of the sublime need not disqualify historical progress altogether, for, he argues, if we abide by the moral law (now in the form of civic Duty and political Justice) we can hope, if not for a millenial path towards Utopia, at least for a trajectory from worse to better.40 Conrad, however, like Nietzsche, has less faith in the moral end of human history, as the pessimistic politics of his 'largest canvas', Nostromo, demonstrate most powerfully. The theatrical image of life as a tragic farce, in which humankind, mystified by tales of Utopia, persists in the always already foredoomed, Sisyphean labour of rolling the boulder of history uphill, is an apt representation of the futile, repetitive nature of history in Nostromo. Decoud's detached, ironical remarks on Costaguanan politics, in this context, have a familiar ring: v Imagine an atmosphere of opera-bouffe in which all the comic business of stage statesmen, brigands, etc. etc., all their farcical stealing, intriguing, and stabbing is done in dead earnest. It is screamingly funny, the blood flows all the time, and the actors believe themselves to be influencing the fate of the universe. Of course, government in general, any government anywhere, is a thing of exquisite comicality to a discerning mind; but really we Spanish Americans do overstep the bounds. No man of ordinary intelligence can take part in the intrigues of une farce macabre'. (N, p. 152) Throughout Nostromo, theatrical imagery like this conveys a sense of the self-deluded nature of revolutionary praxis, the misconception that political action can bring about a desired transformation of human existence. Thus, as Jim Reilly remarks, in Nostromo we are constantly offered dramatic settings for politicalv action' which fails to materialise. It is as if 'the stage is set for an absent epic action...which fails to turn up or which swept off long ago'.41 Or, as Kiernan Ryan puts it: ' The novel delivers no sense of developing action emerging through the vital interplay of the characters with 40 Kant, OOS, in Booth, /W, p. 112. 41 Jim Reilly, Shadowtime: History and Representation in Hardy, Conrad and George Eliot (London: Routledge: 1993), p. 157.</page><page sequence="25">30 each other and their world. Quite the reverse. The narration does not flow, it coils and eddies through a configuration of still centres, congealed settings for action which, if recounted at all, is not fully narrated from the "inside"'.42 The opening description of Sulaco, for example, suggests an amphitheatre awaiting a performance: v Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary ... in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean, with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud' (N, p. 3). When, finally, some pages later, there are signs of revolutionary action to reassure us that this is, after all, a political novel, we are granted only a fleeting, surrealistic impression. The events of the Monterist rebellion are at once depicted and dematerialised by the sublime indifference of the mountain backdrop: Horsemen galloped towards each other, wheeled round together, separated at speed. Giorgio saw one fall, rider and horse disappearing as if they had galloped into a chasm, and the movements of the animated scene were like the passages of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot, yelling with tiny throats, under the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment of silence. (N, pp. 26-27) The mountain's v colossal embodiment of silence' augments the vsolemn hush of the Golfo Placido', that enormous vblind spot' or Vanishing point' around which the narrative rotates; a shadowy correlative of the novel's obfuscatory, dislocatory politics. Together these natural settings, suggestive of overwhelming stasis, undermine all empty propagandist discourses of historical progress, bring home the sublime irrelevance of human action to a dark, amoral, 42 Kiernan Ryan, v Revolution and Repression in Conrad's Nostromo\ in Douglas Jefferson and Graham Martin (eds.), The Uses of Fiction: Essays on the Modem Novel in Honour of Arnold Kettle (Milton Keynes: Open University Press, 1982), p. 167.

Sky, land and sea disappear together out of the world when the Placido ? as the saying is ? goes to sleep under its black poncho. The few stars left below the seaward frown of the vault shine feebly as into the mouth of a black cavern. In its vastness your ship floats unseen under your feet, her sails flutter invisible above your head. The eye of God Himself ? they add with grim profanity ? could not find out what work a man's hand is doing in there; and you would be free to call the devil to your aid with impunity if even his malice were not defeated by such a blind darkness. (N, pp. 6-7) The sublime image of the Golfo Placido also, significantly, serves to underscore the irony of Monygham's belief that Nostromo (of whose moral degradation we are already aware) has proved his moral and physical tenacity by surviving the sinking of the lighter: Having had to encounter single-handed during his period of eclipse many physical dangers, [Monygham] was well aware of the most dangerous element common to them all: of the crushing, paralyzing sense of human littleness, which is what really defeats a man struggling with natural forces, alone, far from the eyes of his fellows. He was eminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himself of the Capataz, after hours of tension and anxiety, precipitated suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness, without earth or sky, and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind, but with sensible success.... vIt must have been terribly dark!' sIt was the worst darkness of the Golfo,' the Capataz asserted, briefly. (N, p. 433) Decoud's suicide on the Golfo Placido, where he sinks 'without a trace, swallowed up in the immense indifference of things', (N, p. 501) makes this moment all the more ironic. For Decoud's death is one of the most sombre and tragic moments in Conrad's 'long</page><page sequence="27">32 dialogue with the darkness'.43 Driven to despair by days of silence and solitude, the sensible world shatters into a schizophrenic Succession of incomprehensible images' (N, p. 498), while the silence assumes the impossible shape of a dark thin string, a schizophrenic parody of historical linearity, vibrating with v senseless phrases, always the same but utterly incomprehensible, about Nostromo, Antonia, Barrios, and proclamations mingled into an ironical and senseless buzzing' (N, p. 499). Interestingly, Schiller, in his version of the sublime, takes the Kantian theme of moral alienation to an extreme which culminates in an act of moral suicide: here man has vno other means of withstanding the power of nature than to anticipate her, and by a free renunciation of all sensuous interest to kill himself morally before some physical force does it'. Moreover, for Schiller, N confusion' is the pre-eminent occasion of the sublime, and by v confusion' he means not merely Nthe spiritual disorder of a natural landscape' but also vthe uncertain anarchy of the moral world', including the amoral chaos of human history in which all best things are confused to ill: N Should one approach history with great expectations of illumination and knowledge ? how very disappointed one is!' (OS, pp. 208, 204, 205, 207). Decoud, we recall, has vthe first moral sentiment of his manhood' (N, p. 498) in the days preceding his death, and, indeed, one could argue that, in a devastating irony, his suicide is the most profound and decisive moral gesture he makes. Yet, in a typically Schillerian conflation, Decoud fs moral self-immolation is also a political suicide, a deliberate renunciation of the nightmare of history in which he finds himself. The play on the French decoudre (to unpick or unstitch) reinforces the association of the sceptical journalist's fate with the suicidal unravelling of the beautiful v guiding-thread1 of history, and recalls a similar tendency in 43 J. Hillis Miller, Poets of Reality: Six Twentieth Century Writers (Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1965), p. 39.</page><page sequence="28">33 Carlyle's disillusioned 'Clothes-philosopher', Teufelsdrockh.44 The historical theme is sustained in the description of his distorted perceptions as he prepares for death. In the moments of schizophrenic depersonalisation which precede the fatal shot, we are given an impossible 'rendering' of history seen no longer as a humanised, teleological narrative, but as the ruin of representation: a sublime concatenation of ' senseless phrases, always the same but utterly incomprehensible' (N9 p. 499). Indeed, if Decoud is finally 'swallowed up in the immense indifference of things' (N, p. 501), this is an indifference not only of Nature, but of the sublime spectacle of human history, and the discourse in which it is constructed.45 The self-reflexive interplay between the sublimity of Nature and ideology is made similarly explicit in Decoud's earlier, premonitory loss of consciousness during an attempted act of historical representation. Struggling to depict the disparate events of the Monterist Revolution in a letter to his sister, he blacks out inexplicably: 'With the writing of the last line there came upon Decoud a moment of sudden and complete oblivion. He swayed over the table as if struck by a bullet' (N, p. 249). In Fredric Jameson's post-modernist terms, it is as if the discourse itself ' suddenly yawns and discloses at its heart a void which is at one with the temporary extinction of the subject' ,46 The representational task of the liberal historian, Don Jose Avellanos, who has close political links with the benign Dictator of 44 I am indebted to Keith Carabine for this point. 45 It is surely no mere coincidence that Decoud's v moral' act of self annihilation finds a political parallel in Conrad's vAutocracy and War'. For Holy Russia, vLe Neant', Conrad writes, vthe only conceivable self-reform is ? suicide' (MX, p. 101). 46 Fredric Jameson, PU9 p. 260. Throughout Conrad's fiction sublime moments of alienation and self-loss are signalled by experiences of amnesia, delirium, dizziness, falling and sudden sleep or loss of consciousness. Moreover, in keeping with his preoccupation with discursivity, or what one could legitimately describe as his modern, Nietzschean sublimity, these moments are frequently associated with scenes of reading and/or writing. Cf Viola's death at the end of Nostromo, as the literal extreme of Jameson's sublime Extinction of the subject'.</page><page sequence="29">34 Costaguana and doctor of philosophy, Don Vincente Ribiera, is similarly doomed to failure. When the Monterists seize the print offices in Sulaco, the newly-printed sheets of his magnum opus on the history of Costaguana, Fifty Years of Misrule are used as ammunition, v fired out as wads for trabucos loaded with handfuls of type1 (N, p. 235), while discarded pages blow about in random gusts of wind through the deserted streets. This image becomes a self-reflexive mirror image, at a thematic level, of Conrad's formal strategies of narrative dislocation in the novel, which similarly disrupt order and intelligibility and violate expectations of a beautiful, sequential rendering of historical events. Eloise Knapp Hay remarks on the way in which the fragmentary narrative of Part 1 in particular obscures and confuses the novel's historical plot. Challenging Jocelyn Baines's view that these chronological involutions convey vthe simultaneity of visual experience which a painting offers', she argues, employing the vocabulary of the sublime, that the technique in fact has Nthe reverse effect to that of ordinary painting, since [it] break[s] all the pictures...into fragments' and thereby contributes to Nostromo's vdramatic impenetrability', and v "hollow" reverberation'. She concludes that N [i]t would be just as true to say that abstractionist painters are endeavouring to approach the concatenation (as opposed to simultaneity) of disconnected visual effects achieved by Conrad in Nostromo'.47 Against this backdrop, Mitchell's pompous discourse on the providential course of Sulacan history, his romantic conception of Sulaco's future as the v Treasure-House of the World', stands out as a travesty of the philosophical historian's beautifully framed, teleological narratives, which fail to account for the forces of blind chance. v [U]tterly in the dark, and imagining himself to be in the thick of things (N, p. 112), he recalls the Sprecher in post Renaissance depictions of historical events, the authority figure who engages the viewer with a direct gaze and, pointing to the battle 47 Hay, PN, p. 176.

Proudly displaying his golden chronometer, marking historical time, his enthusiastic commentary goes on vrelentless, like a law of Nature' (N, p. 481),48 while his trapped victims listen vlike a tired child to a fairy tale' (N, p. 487). Significantly, among the litany of those who have vmade history' in Mitchell's starry eyes are Nostromo, whose heroic ride to Cayta v would make a most exciting book' (N9 p. 482), and Don Jose Avellanos, whose political efforts are romantically commemorated on a plaque in the cathedral as a v lifelong struggle for Right and Justice at the dawn of the New Era' (N, p. 477).49 This picturesque view of things, which erroneously conflates political and imaginative vision, reading and seeing, words and deeds, is associated not only with the optimistic narrative of the 48 In his essay, v An Old Question Raised Again', Kant similarly describes the way in which philosophical historians view the French Revolution as part of the natural growth of history, or, in Kant's words, as vthe evolution of a constitution in accordance with natural law1 (in Booth, IW, p. 122). 49 The capitalist financier Holroyd takes Mitchell's picturesque, providential ideology to a megalomaniacal extreme: vTime itself has got to wait on the greatest country in the whole of God's Universe. We shall be giving the word for everything: industry, trade, law, journalism, art, politics, and religion, from Cape Horn clear over to Smith's Sound, and beyond, too, if anything worth taking hold of turns up at the North Pole.

However the picturesque, fairy-tale view of things is associated most obviously with those seductive aesthetic representatives of the barren capitalist ideology of N material interests', the Incorruptible Capataz de Cargadores and Emilia Gould, the vgood fairy' (N, p. 520) of Sulaco, who believes in the preservation of N simple and picturesque things' (N, p. 120). While Emilia Gould observes her husband's growing ideological abstraction with dread, she responds imaginatively and sympathetically to Nostromo, whose v sensuous and picturesque' identity gives him an equally seductive power within the People.50 Yet there remains no doubt of the superficiality of the ideology of the beautiful, and its myths of sensuous immanence, as the implosion of Nostromo's identity testifies. The v abyss left by the collapse of his vanity' leaves him vas ready to become the prey of any belief, superstition, or desire as a child' (N, p. 417). Like T.S. Eliot's hollow men, Nostromo, Our Man, is at once everyman and no-man, everything and nothing, the debased symbol of an ideology whose immanent meaning has drained away and betrayed an ugly gap. v "Ah, yes! True. I am nothing'", he says to Monygham, who replies, N "Not at all. You are everything'" (N9 p. 457). Nostromo's 50 Cf Decoud on Gould's sentimentalism: VI think he can be drawn into it, like all idealists, when he once sees a sentimental basis for his action." (N, p. 216). This, of course, is what initially draws the sentimental Emilia to Charles Gould. Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness similarly take as their starting point the dangerous mystifications of the idealistic Romantic imagination (Jim, Kurtz).</page><page sequence="32">37 birth into moral and self-awareness is therefore, ironically, synonymous with the failure of moral immanence, although, picturesque to the last, he succumbs in turn to the seductive power of the silver and the cliched rhetoric of romantic fantasy: He had kept the treasure for purposes of revenge; but now he cared nothing for it. He cared only for [Giselle]. He would put her beauty in a palace on a hill crowned with olive trees ? a white palace above a blue sea. He would keep her there like a jewel in a casket. He would get land for her ? her own land fertile with vines and corn ? to set her little feet upon' (N, p. 541). Emilia Gould's profound vision of the emptiness underlying the ideals by which she has justified her husband's pursuit of wealth, by contrast denies her the solace of picturesque dreams: An immense desolation, the dread of her own continued life, descended upon the first lady of Sulaco. With a prophetic vision she saw herself surviving alone the degradation of her young ideal of life, of love, of work ? all alone in the Treasure House of the World. The profound, blind, suffering expression of a painful dream settled on her face with its closed eyes. In the indistinct voice of an unlucky sleeper, lying passive in the grip of a merciless nightmare, she stammered out aimlessly the words ? vMaterial interests.' (TV, p. 522) If Mrs Gould herself succumbs to a pessimistic, sublime vision of human nature and history, where are we to take our moral bearings in Nostromol The answer is hard to find. The most plausible alternative to her beleaguered sentimental philosophy is the Christian/ Garibaldean ethics of duty represented by Viola and his dark-haired, dutiful daughter, Linda. Yet the novel ends ambiguously , suggesting that even the Garibaldino's moral, and, by implication, political, faith has been eroded. The dying man, his days of revolutionary activism long past, seems to encounter the same blind spot of ideology which undermines Emilia Gould's hold on life. Taking up his Bible and the silver-mounted spectacles she has given to him, he can no longer see beyond the print he reads:</page><page sequence="33">38 "Where are you going?' he asked. vTo the light,' she answered, turning round to look at him baleftilly. vThe light! Si - duty.' Very upright, white-haired, leonine, heroic in his absorbed quietness, he felt in the pocket of his red shirt for the spectacles given him by Dona Emilia. He put them on. After a long period of immobility he opened the book, and from on high looked through the glasses at the small print in double columns. A rigid, stern expression settled upon his features with a slight frown, as if in response to some gloomy thought or unpleasant sensation.... [H]e swayed forward, gently, gradually, till his snow-white head rested upon the open pages. A wooden clock ticked methodically on the white-washed wall, and growing slowly cold the Garibaldino lay alone, rugged, undecayed, like an old oak uprooted by a treacherous gust of wind (N, p. 565).</page></plain_text>
