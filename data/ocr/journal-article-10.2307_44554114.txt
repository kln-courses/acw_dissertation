ABSTRACT Two 50th percentile anthropomorphic test devices are specified as alternate test devices for FMVSS 208 compliance testing. These test devices are commonly known as the Hybrid II and the Hybrid III dummies. The designs of the two dummies are different, representing the state-of-the-art in the time frame of their designs. The trajectory differences between the two dum- mies have been published in the literature, but response differ- ences, e.g., HIC and chest acceleration are not available in the literature. To quantify response differences between the two dummies, a series of sled tests with open bucks and with bucks simulating vehicle interior were conducted with restrained dummies. Addi- tional crash tests were also conducted with the two dummies. This paper reports on an analysis of the data from the above series of tests. The data indicate that in non-head contact simulations with belt restraint systems, Hybrid III HIC's are nearly 50% higher than Hybrid II HIC's. Additionally, in the above test condition, Hybrid III chest accelerations are nearly 27% higher than Hybrid II chest accelerations. With air bag restraint systems, statistically significant differences in dummy responses were not observed due to limited test conditions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to report and analyze the results of sled and barrier crash tests comparing the responses of the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies in identical severity tests with belt and/or air bag restraint systems. BACKGROUND The Hybrid II dummy was introduced in 1973 as a test device for testing air bag restraint vehicles to the requirement of the FMVSS 208. This dummy has since been used for design, development and certification of vehicles equipped with belts or air bags. With the phase-in of the FMVSS 208 passive re- straint standard beginning in 1987, another dummy, known as the Hybrid III, was made an alternate test device to demonstrate compliance. This dummy was first described by Foster et al. in 1977 (1). The head, neck, chest and knees of the Hybrid III were designed based on biomechanical response corridors developed from cadaver and human volunteer testing. Foster et al. (1) have reported that the Hybrid III dummy component impact re- sponses are more "biofidelic" than those of the Hybrid II dum- my. Additionally, a curved lumbar spine was introduced in the Hybrid III dummy to more closely simulate the sitting posture of vehicle occupants. The Hybrid III dummy also had additional response measurement capabilities when compared to the Hybrid II - the most important being neck forces and moments at the atlanto-occipital junction, and sternal deflection. With further development, knee, tibia, ankle, and knee-shear measurement capabilities have been added. Since compliance with FMVSS 208 can be demonstrated by either dummy, it is important for vehicle designers to know the performance differences, if any, between the Hybrid II and the Hybrid III dummies. Therefore, the dynamic responses of the two dummies in identical test conditions and restraint systems need to be established. Few studies addressing this question are currently available in the literature. Foster et al. (1) have reported repeatability test results with the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies with belt-restraint systems in an open buck on the Hyge sled. Their results show that the Hybrid III HIC and chest accelerations are somewhat higher than those of the Hybrid II in the condition tested. An accident reconstruction study by Saul et al. (2) has compared Hybrid II and Hybrid III responses in a Volvo passenger seat and three- point belt system. Their study shows that the Hybrid III HICs and chest accelerations were nearly the same as those of the Hybrid II. However, the HIC durations of the Hybrid III were shorter than those of the Hybrid II (59 ms vs. 79 ms) , and peak head accelerations of the Hybrid III were substantially higher than of the Hybrid II dummy (74.5 G's vs. 57.2 G's). This indicates that the currently mandated 36 ms HIC's would have been much higher with the Hybrid III dummy than with the Hybrid II. A recent study by Freeman et al. (3) reports on the differences in trajectories of the two dummies in identical test conditions with belt restraints. This study shows that these trajectory differences are in part due to differences in the seating posture of the two dummies and the greater tendency of the Hybrid II to rotate around the shoulder belt. When a hypothetical steer- 1789</page><page sequence="2">ing wheel was superimposed in the design position, the calcu- lated impact velocity of the Hybrid III dummy head with the steering wheel was 10.5 m/s versus 7.6 m/s with the Hybrid II dummy. This study also showed that the Hybrid III HICs were 68% higher than those of the Hybrid II, while the Hybrid III chest accelerations were approximately 22% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. A compilation of Docket responses for FMVSS 208 has been reported by NHTSA in the Final Regulatory Evaluation(4). Tables of Hybrid II and Hybrid III response differences observed by various manufacturers and by NHTSA's own VRTC have been included. The response differences between the two dummies have been tabulated by restraint systems, and contain the only reference to response differences in air bag restraint systems. Note that in the above reported studies, the impact severities were not varied and the air bag tests are too few to arrive at statistically valid conclusions. TEST METHODOLOGY: For belt restraint testing, tightly controlled, hard seat Hyge sled tests were conducted in an open buck. These tests had the Hybrid II and the Hybrid III dummies in three point continuous loop belt restraint systems. The tests were performed with the two dummies side-by-side, and hence may be considered as paired testing. A higher level of complexity was added in another series of sled tests with belted Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies in a vehicle interior simulating the passenger side of a mid-size car. For further validation of the results of these sled tests, full scale barrier crash tests were conducted with Hybrid III dummies in several vehicles for which data with Hybrid II dummies were available. For air bags, several tests were conducted on the Hyge sled using Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies. In these tests, the severity of impact was varied and unbelted and belted occupants were simulated. These tests were not paired because each test had a driver and passenger simulation. DESCRIPTION OF THE TESTS WITH BELTS: Hard Seat Tests: A series of Hyge sled tests in open bucks was conducted at three levels of severity with Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies side by side, on hard seats, with three-point restraint systems. Dummy head, chest and pelvis accelerations, and axial femur loads were measured. Additionally, with the Hybrid III, neck forces and moments and chest deflections were measured.

Passenger Side Simulation With Vehicle Interior Tests: A series of eight sled tests simulating the passenger side envi- ronment of a mid-size car were performed with Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies in three-point belt restraint systems using production belts, instrument panels, seats and windshields. Each test used a new instrument panel, seat and belt restraint. The sled pulse simulated a 35 mph fixed barrier crash pulse for a mid-size car. Full Scale Barrier Crash Tests: Six full scale 35 mph barrier crash tests of different vehicles were conducted with Hybrid III dummies in the driver and passenger positions. Comparable test response data with Hybrid II dummies in these cars were available. Since only a single crash is available per vehicle, the results of this series can be used only for trend studies and not for establishing statistically valid results. TOST RESULTS: Sled Test Results With Hard Seats: The peak responses from this test series are shown in Table 1. In general the Hybrid III responses were somewhat more repeatable than those of the Hybrid II dummy. In spite of the controls used during the tests, the variability of Hybrid II HIC's was much higher than that of the Hybrid III dummy across the three severities tested. No apparent differences were observed in belt spoolout or shoulder belt loads, so belt factors could not explain the observed variability between the two dummies. High speed movies of the tests show that the Hybrid III dummy chest stayed in the shoulder belt but the Hybrid II dummy had sub- stantial rotation around the shoulder belt. This observation is consistent with that of Freeman et al. (3). Across the severities tested, the peak femur and shoulder belt loads developed by the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies were nearly equal. However differences in peak chest responses and HIC's between the two dummies were observed. Figures 5-8 show a comparison of the chest, head, femur load and shoulder belt load-time responses for the two dummies in the mid-sever- ity tests. The figures show that in general the Hybrid III dum- my responses for head and chest accelerations were in a tighter band than those of the Hybrid II dummy. Additionally, the Hybrid II chest acceleration-time history shows a nearly fiat curve, whereas the Hybrid III dummy shows a peaked shape. But peak Hybrid III chest and head accelerations are higher than of the Hybrid II dummy. Across the three severities tested, the average Hybrid III chest accelerations were 27% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. Table 1 shows that the uncon- strained HIC's of the Hybrid III dummy were 3.4% to 19% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. However, when the currently used 36 ms HIC's (4) are examined, the average Hybrid III HIC's were 24% to 61% higher than the Hybrid II HIC's. The results of this series were compared to those reported by NHTSA (4).

It can be seen from Table 2 that the chest accelerations of the Hybrid III dummy were 24% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. However, in this series the Hybrid III 36 ms HICs were nearly 150% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. 1793</page><page sequence="6">Hybrid II - Hybrid III Comparison 3 PT.

Full Scale Crash Test Results: The results of the full-scale, 35 mph barrier crash tests compar- ing Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummy responses for a subcompact and a mid-size car are shown in Table 3. The passenger side dummies did not contact the vehicle interior and therefore their data are comparable to the two sled-test series discussed above. For these non-head contact cases, the Hybrid III dummy HIC's were 45% to 52% higher than the Hybrid II HIC's. This is consistent with the previously described sled test data. The Hybrid III chest accelerations in the mid-size car were 19% to 25% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. This is again consistent with the sled data. However, the results of the sub-compact car tests show little difference in chest accelerations between the two dummies. Some of the differences between sled test results and crash test results may be due to test-to-test variability. Additionally, the sled test data was generated with three-point belt restraint systems, but the sub-compact car had a passive shoulder belt and manual lap belt. Additional trends in differences between the Hybrid II and the Hybrid III dummy responses in full-scale barrier crash tests can be seen from Table 4. This table compares dummy responses between NCAP crash tests with Hybrid II dummies and similar tests conducted at Ford with Hybrid III dummies. It can be seen that the passenger side chest acceleration responses with the Hybrid III dummies were 9% to 26% higher than with the Hybrid II dummies. In the only three non-contact cases (car 1, 4 and 5) , the Hybrid III HIC's were 20% to 68% higher than the Hybrid II HIC's. In three cars (2, 3 and 6) head contacts with the vehicle interior or with the dummy's knees were de- tected with the Hybrid III dummies, whereas no head contact was detected with the Hybrid II. Due to these contacts, the Hybrid III dummy HIC's were found to be 90% to 128% higher than those with the Hybrid II. Although statistical significance may not be attached to these crash test data, the trends appear to agree with the previously described sled test results. The crash test results of the above eight vehicles are the only source of data from which comparisons between Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummy responses in belt restraint systems for the driver side can be made. In these tests head contact with forward vehicle components were detected with both the dum- mies. Although statistical significance may not be attached to these data, some trends can be seen. For the drivers restrained with only three-point belt systems, the Hybrid III HIC's were nearly the same (car 1) to nearly 145% higher (in mid-size car, Table 3) than the Hybrid II HIC's. With the addition of air bags in cars 2 and 3, the Hybrid III HIC's were lower in one car and somewhat higher in the other compared to the Hybrid II HIC's. 1794</page><page sequence="7">Analysis of Belt Restraint Test Data: Figures 11 and 12 compare HIC and chest acceleration re- sponses between Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies in all tests conducted at Ford. These figures indicate that on an average the Hybrid III HIC and chest accelerations are substantially higher than those of the Hybrid II in identical crash-severity tests. The reasons for these response differences are hypothe- sized to be due to design differences between the two dummies, and will be discussed in the following sections.

O'a Figure 12 Hybrid II-Hybrid III chest acceleration comparison in belt tests The Hybrid III chest is more compliant than that of the Hybrid II. Additionally, the shoulder and chest of the Hybrid III dummy are designed to pocket the shoulder belt. As a result of these features, the Hybrid III dummy shows a more planar motion than does the Hybrid II. The greater tendency of the Hybrid II dummy to roll out of the shoulder belt results in lower chest and head accelerations, and also lower HICs. Another factor that accounts for some of the differences in chest accelerations between the two dummies is the vertical location of the accelerometers in the thoracic spine box. In the Hybrid II the "chest" accelerometers are in the shoulder area, just under the neck bracket, whereas the Hybrid III chest accelerometers are located about 100 mm lower near the chest center of gravity. Mathematical modeling confirms that the Hybrid III acceriero- meter location will tend to slightly raise the chest acceleration, but cannot account for all the differences observed in these tests. The distance from the bottom of the neck to the center of gravity of the Hybrid III dummy head is 33 mm longer than with the Hybrid II. The neck stiffness of the Hybrid III dummy is considerably less than that of the Hybrid II (see Ref.l). As a result, with belt restraint systems, the Hybrid III dummy head "whips" more than does the Hybrid II head, which results in higher head accelerations and HICs. To validate this hypothesis, two-dimensional mathematical models of the Hybrid II and the Hybrid III were exercised. These models have been reported by the author in (5) and (6). The mathematical models show that if the Hybrid III neck and head is replaced in the model by the Hybrid II neck and head, there is a decrease of 34% in HIC when compared to the full Hybrid III dummy model result. Additionally, if the model responses of the two dummies are compared for identical-severi- ty simulations, Hybrid III HIC would be 94% higher than that of the Hybrid II. Both of these modeling results fall in the range observed in the tests. Additionally, the mathematical models indicate that the Hybrid III chest accelerations would be approximately 18% higher than those of the Hybrid II. Again, this result is consistent with test data discussed earlier. Conclusions of The Belt-Restraint Tests and Analysis: Based on the data cited in previous reports and those of the current series of tests and mathematical models, the Hybrid III chest acceleration and HIC responses are considerably higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy in identical severity tests with belt-restraint systems. The best estimate is 50% higher HIC with the Hybrid III compared to that of the Hybrid II in non-head contact situations. The best estimate for chest acceler- ation is that the Hybrid III is 22% higher than the Hybrid II in identical-severity tests. IMPLICATION: The implication of the above identified differ- ences in responses is that a vehicle with belt restraint systems , designed with the Hybrid II dummy at or near the limits of FMVSS 208, may require design actions if it has to meet the same requirements with the Hybrid III dummy. These design actions could include front end length increase, seat belt stiff- ness changes and/or redesign of forward components of the vehicle likely to be contacted by front seat dummies. Based on the data in Table 1, it is possible to roughly estimate the re- quired front end length increase to maintain the same dummy injury numbers for a 48 km/h barrier crash. For example, the Hybrid II dummy reaches a HIC of approximately 700 in the 80 ms test pulse which has 18.7 inches (475 mm) stopping dis- 1795</page><page sequence="8">tance, but the Hybrid III dummy reaches the same level of 700 HIC in the 96 ms sled pulse test which has 22.3 inches (565 mm) stopping distance. This shows that for the same HIC&gt; the Hybrid III will require about 3.6 inches more front end length than would the Hybrid II for the belt-only restraint condition. The investigation of other design actions is beyond the scope of this paper. An examination of Table 1 also indicates that HIC is likely to be higher than 1000 before chest acceleration exceeds 60 G's when using the Hybrid III dummy. However, the real-world implication of these higher HICs in non-contact cases is not obvious. Accident data indicate that non-contact head injuries are extremely rare (7), showing that HIC may not be a valid indicator of head injury in these cases. Proposals to use 15 ms HICs or HICs calculated only during head contact should be investigated (8). SAE has recently developed a test procedure, SAE J2052, for measuring head contact duration during crash tests with the Hybrid III dummy. AIR BAG TEST SERIES: A series of tests with air bags was conducted to determine whether the response differences between the two dummies identified with belt systems were valid when air bags were used as the restraint system. Four tests simulating a 30 mph barrier crash test of a compact car were conducted on the Hyge sled with Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies restrained by driver and passenger air bags alone. An additional four tests simulating 35 mph crash tests of a compact car were conducted with three- point active belts and air bags. Test Results: The results of these series of tests comparing the responses of the two dummies are shown in Table 5 and figures 13 and 14. It can be seen from the figures that the HIC and chest accelera- tion response of the two dummies were comparable, although there is a tendency for the Hybrid III dummy chest accelerations to be about 10% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. Due to the limited number of tests and test-to-test variability, statistically significant differences between dummy responses are not observed. The results of this series of air bag tests do not agree with the results cited by NHTSA (4) where Hybrid III chest accelerations were 8% to 24% lower than those of the Hybrid II. In the same NHTSA series, the Hybrid III HICs were 4% higher to 66% lower than those of the Hybrid II dummy. The reasons for such divergent results between the current test series and those cited in (4) are not known. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The results of several studies comparing the responses of Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies in identical severity tests have been described. These studies have been conducted with belt and air bag restraint systems. The data indicate that with belt systems, the Hybrid III dummy head and chest responses are significantly higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. In the non-contact situation, the Hybrid III 36 ms HICs are on the average 50% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. Also, with belt restraint systems, the Hybrid III chest accelerations are about 22% higher than those of the Hybrid II dummy. Based on a limited number of air bag tests, indications are that the differ- ences in HIC and chest acceleration responses between the two TABLE 5 HYBRID II - HYBRID III COMPARISONS -- AIRBAG ALONÉ SLED TESTS 30 mph test speed DRIVER Test HIC Chest Acc .
