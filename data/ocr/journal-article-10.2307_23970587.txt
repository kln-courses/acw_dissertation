<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thou Who Art: The Concept of the Personality of God. By JOHN A. T. Robinson. Introduction by Rowan WILLIAMS. Pp. xi + 375. New York and London: Continuum, 2006. ISBN ο 8264 8897 8. £19.99. WHILE doctoral dissertations tend to be notoriously wordy and dense documents, not many of them are mature works of such sophistication that they can appear, as this one does, after the end of a lifetime of writing, and yet as arguably its pinnacle— both presaging and completing a theologian's life's work. That this book has taken so long to appear, for whatever reason, constitutes a serious omission. How much thinking on the Trinity, Christology, and the Christian doctrine of the human person in the last half century would have benefited from this dissertation's having been available in the public domain! And how much light might have been cast with profit on the author's subsequent work! Reading a book such as this is like climbing a long mountain spur. It is a slow and at times difficult process, but at each pause the view incorporates the previous views in a (sometimes vertiginous) new perspective. The writer is a logician. He argues his case with meticulous precision, building it inch by inch—yet for all the complexity and necessary repetition, always lucidly. The eminently readable Robinson of books such as Honest to God, The Human Face of God, and Re-dating the New Testament is here too, in this his earliest substantial piece of writing. Being first and foremost a philosopher, as a philosophical or fundamental theologian Robinson begins not with doctrine but with the philosophy of personality. This is the subject of Part I. He builds a case for a relational theory of personality based on Martin Buber's Ich und Du (Ί and Thou'), and he builds it like a Bach fugue, voice by voice, layer by layer, with inexorable logic. Human personality is argued to be constituted not in 'an individual substance of a rational nature' as in the classical theory (which Robinson !) The Author 2007.

Accordingly, I become myself only in relation to another, but another who is a 'thou', not an 'it' (for to relate to others as objects is to use and thereby depersonalize them, not to encounter them as free and responsible agents), and ultimately in relation to the divine 'Thou'. In Part II Robinson applies the theory to 'the other pole of the divine—human encounter': the personality of God. Here I found some of the most important writing in this book. Taking the classical divine perfections and recasting them within the priority of love, the author demonstrates very convincingly that if we are to understand and experience God as Thou, a 'thou' whose existence is love, who engages and requires us in love, then all other divine attributes must necessarily be aspects of this love. When this is done, the results are startling and transforming. Coherence emerges and conundrums of divine sovereignty and human freedom begin to clarify. When it comes to issues of time and eternity, the understanding of God as Thou, now seen as Lord of Time and Eternity, again recasts the discussion, exposing some time-honoured questions as category mistakes. Implications for the doctrine of God are signposted along the way, implications which, while disturbing at times, do not fall into the trap of being based on anthropomorphic analogy (if human, therefore, analogously, divine) but instead draw on biblical images of divine personality. While it may stand to reason that this is the true nature of human personality, true to his critique of Hellenistic theology Robinson is not building his case on reason alone but shows such an understanding of personality to be consistent with what is biblically revealed about the personality of God. So far so good, but then the author, never a man to avoid the hard questions, pursues his argument in relation to a more controversial issue flagged up in Part I: the question of whether the construal of divine—human relationship as mutually 'I-Thou' requires him in turn to conclude that in some way humanity (or creation) is necessary to God. 'If', as he argues on p. 146, 'the essential nature of love is to be self-diffusive, to exist only in relation to an "other" on whom it can pour itself out, [then] God, that is to say, being love, had to create'. The next several pages are devoted to demonstrating how this may be so without falling into the fatal trap of inferring that divine existence requires creation. It is not that God is incomplete (i.e. imperfect)</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 373 without creation, rather that God is unfulfilled without this relationship, for 'if God is really love, he can have no joy outside his dealings with creation' (p. 150). In Part III, the context shifts to systematic theology as Robinson applies the development of the argument in Parts I and II to the Trinity. Is a relational model of personality compatible with an orthodox formulation of this doctrine? Initially it appears not and one wonders which will be the casualty: the theory or the doctrine, as Robinson finds wanting, as inevitably tritheistic, those trinitarian models of divine personality which attempt to read Ί-thou' relationships into the essential Trinity. Might not the Fathers have got the classical theory of personality (more or less) right after all? We are taken on a tour of the classical doctrine of Processions accompanied by Aquinas and Barth, but in the end that too is judged to be flawed. The subordinationism inherent in this doctrine hangs on aspects of Sonship (obedience and servanthood) that cannot (Robinson argues) be demonstrated to be an eternal aspect of the Second Person of the Trinity. While the only biblically attested intra-divine Ί-thou' relation ship is that between the incarnate Christ and God the Father, this is in fact a divine—human relationship; it constitutes the perfect human response to God. Ultimately that perfect obedience, even Sonship per se, must be identified as integral to Christ's humanity and not an aspect of his divinity that is eternally present in the Second Person of the Trinity. In other words, subordinationism is not built into the essential Trinity, so this theory too must fall. In the end the author is indebted more to Barth than to Aquinas in coming up with a solution he finds workable, but I am not going to steal his thunder by revealing how he does it. While one might not agree with all the author's conclusions and while, after over half a century of wasteful obscurity, his work cannot be said to break new ground today, nevertheless it has a freshness that gives it the force of new insight. Even the frequent skirmishes with 'Hellenistic thought', in which it is opposed to the 'biblical Hebraic' in a way that does not stand up in this postmodern age (skirmishes which show Robinson to be a man of his time), have touches which reveal the trailblazer in him—if only the work had seen the light of his day! I found I wanted to savour and weigh every word of this weighty tome with delight at the erudition therein, the lucidity and aptness of the expression—and, not least, the passion and commitment.</page><page sequence="4">374 REVIEWS As Rowan Williams notes in his introduction, Robinson's personal faith is evident at every turn. The divine love of which he speaks is personally experienced; it is no abstract thing. Here indeed is the man of faith stating his utter conviction! Now that we have been graced at last with his seminal work, I now want to reread his subsequent books in the light of the whole man and the whole work. doi:10.1093/jts/flm014 Sue Patterson Ballina, Co.
