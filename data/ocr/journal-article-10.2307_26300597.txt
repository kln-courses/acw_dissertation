The burial contained a sub-adult male interred with an incised bone flute and a plaster-backed iron-ore mirror. The Yugüe flute is the earliest reported bone flute from Mesoamerica and is incised and carved to create the bas relief image of a skeletal male figure. Based on the instrument’s archaeological context and elaborate incising, we argue that the flute was categorized in pre-Columbian ontology as an animate object that actively participated in ceremonial action at Yugüe. While the nature of such ceremony remains unclear, the incising on the flute indicates that the instrument was capable of making manifest ancestral and divine forces affiliated with rain, wind, and agricultural fertility. While ancient music was inherently ephemeral, gone once its sound mirror and holding an elaborately incised bone flute. Both the incis- ceased, an extensive record of portable objects, visual art, and eth- ing on the instrument and its archaeological context offer a unique nohistoric documents attest to its importance in pre-Columbian opportunity to consider the social context of music and musical Mesoamerica. Musical instruments appear in exclusive high-status instruments at Yugüe and in Mesoamerica more broadly. Like contexts such as palaces (Inomata and Stiver 1998; Stockli 2007) many Mesoamerican instruments (Hammond 1972; Marti 1955, and temple precincts (Both 2005a). Musicians and instruments 1968; Martínez López and Winter 1994; Mendoza 1941; Payne were painted onto temple walls (Gann 1901; Miller 1988) and in and Hartley 1992; Peterson 1952; Sánchez Santiago 2005), the the pages of codices.

Their ubiquity in the archaeological flute was an animate object with a voice and a life essence that record emphasizes their significance; people of all social positions actively participated in social action. Attributing animacy to the played musical instruments for a wide range of purposes. While flute requires us to consider musical production as the documentation and organology of Mesoamerican musical part of interactions between human and “nonhuman” beings instruments has a long scholarly history (Both 2010), consideration (following Walker 2008; see also Gell 1998; Latour 1999; of the social context of pre-Columbian music is a topic that has only Mills and Ferguson 2008) rather than simply as human- recently been broached by researchers (Both 2005b, 2007; Houston produced harmonic or rhythmic sound.

The more recent studies B14-I16 was not simply the interment of a young man and suggest that music was not simply an aural accompaniment to his possessions, but rather the multiple burial of animate beings certain kinds of social action and that musical instruments were linked, in life and in death, through their social relationships with more than tools for producing sound. Instead, recent research one another. suggests that music and instruments were enmeshed in communi- cation and interaction between humans and other animate entities within the Mesoamerican universe.

There are four stops human sacrifice, we believe that the burial context and contents running down the ventral side with a probable fifth stop near the more strongly support the interpretation that he was a prominent bell of the flute on the bone’s dorsal side. While four stops are community member who died of natural causes.1 BA1 itself was common in Mesoamerican flutes, frequently occurring in examples a supra-domestic burial location for individuals of varying social made of ceramic from the Classic (a.d. 300–800) and Postclassic positions (Barber 2005). The very elaborate items with which I16 (a.d. 800–1521) periods (Both 2002; Crossley-Holland 1980; was buried distinguish him from the other 43 individuals buried Marti 1978; Payne and Hartley 1992), instruments with stops on in the cemetery. However, at least one adult woman from BA1 had pyrite incrustations in her incisors and a juvenile was interred holding a string of white stone and greenstone beads. Burial offer- ings from earlier interments nearby also contained grave goods, including a greenstone pendant interred with a juvenile and four ceramic jars placed in the burial of an adult. Thus, several individ- uals of different ages and sexes buried in this part of the site were distinguished from others through grave goods. The fact that some, but not all, individuals were interred with grave goods suggests that people with differing access to social valuables were buried there. Pathologies within the cemetery also varied, with some individuals showing limited post-weaning evidence for phys- ical stress and others manifesting health problems like anemia and arthritis that may have been influenced by lower social status (Mayes and Barber 2008; Melmed 2006). BA1 also contained both sexes and all ages, reiterating the area’s use as a local, collec- tive burial site. All of the intact adult interments in BA1 follow an azimuth of 15° east of north, a locally-significant orientation repeated site-wide in architecture, burials, and caches for at least 400 years. We doubt that a human sacrifice would be included in a community cemetery. There is also the issue of Yugüe’s size. At 9.75 ha, it was a third-order site in the lower Verde’s Terminal Formative site hierarchy and over 20 times smaller in area than the regional political center of Río Viejo. While regional political relations at this time are not well understood, we find it unlikely that a small site such as Yugüe would be a locus at which human sacrifice was carried out. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE YUGÜE FLUTE The Yugüe Flute as a Musical Instrument The Yugüe flute was a vertically held external duct flute (following Hornbostel and Sachs 1961:26) made from the left femur of a white- 1 This burial obviously begs comparison to the Toxcatl ceremony, in which a young man who had spent a year impersonating the Aztec divinity Tezcatlipoca and playing the flute was sacrificed (see Olivier 2002, 2003). However, there is neither evidence for such a divinity or ceremony prior to the Postclassic period (Olivier 2003:123) nor that such a divinity was ever recognized by ethnic groups in Oaxaca (Paddock 1985).

Like all instruments in the duct-flute family, external-duct flutes produce sound by forcing air over a beveled edge in the instrument’s windway; the edge is usually located on a square aperture somewhere below the mouthpiece (Crossley-Holland 1980). In external-duct flutes, a duct separate from the main resonating chamber of the instrument is used to channel air over the beveled edge. In the case of the Yugüe flute, a separate duct was necessary for the production of sound because the aperture is located approximately 1.5 cm below the dorsal projection of the distal condyles, making it impossible to blow directly onto the beveled edge (see Figure 7). No duct was found with the instrument when it was excavated, indicating either that the flute was interred without the duct or that the duct was made from organic material that did not preserve. Because of the instrument’s extremely fragile condition, it cannot be played. Information on the range of tones the flute produced is therefore unavailable. External-duct flutes are documented in Mesoamerican ethnogra- phy, ethnohistory, and archaeology (Barber et al. 2009). Flutes with external ducts of perishable material have been described ethnogra- phically for the Lacandon Maya (Marti 1968), the Pames of north- east Mexico (Contreras Arias 1988), the Yaquis of Sonora (Desmore 1972), and the Coras of Nayarit (Jauregi 1993). External-duct flutes are depicted in the Dresden Codex, the Codex Tonindeye, and the Codex Iya Nacuaa (Figure 8).2 The duct flutes depicted in the two Mixtec Codices are part of a place name sometimes translated as the “Hill of the Flowery Flutes,” a location that Manuel Hermann Lejarazu (2006) has argued was probably located on the coast of Oaxaca. Interestingly, these possibly coastal flutes have a Figure 8.

Five other bone flutes, all dating to the Classic or Postclassic period, have been recov- ered at sites in highland Oaxaca (Barber et al. 2009). 2 The Codex Tonindeye is also known as the Codex Nuttall or Codex Zouche-Nuttall and the Codex Ica Nacuaa is also known as the Codex Alfonso Caso or the Codex Columbino-Becker (see Jansen and Pérez Jiménez 2004:269).

The bend in the individ- ual’s left knee, for instance, is incised over a protuberance in the distal diaphysis of the bone. The front and back portions of the loin cloth appear on different sides of the bone. And the carvings on the femoral head create a three-dimensional volute emanating from the mouth of the buccal-masked figure. The rendering of the image and the motifs present reveal evi- dence of cultural transmission between both highland-coastal and transcoastal interaction spheres. The cluttered organization of the incised design on the flute is reminiscent of later Formative period art from the southern highlands and coast of Mesoamerica. The entire bone is carved or incised, with little open space between elements. Similarly crowded incising is present on some Figure 10.

The crossed-band motif on the central figure’s loincloth also appears on five stelae at Izapa (2, 4, 11, 22, and 60) (Norman 1973), but it does not appear in Zapotec art until the Classic period, when it is modeled on ceramic urns (Sellen 2007). The buccal mask worn by the individual adhering to the central volute is typical of Zapotec imagery from the later Formative and Classic periods. Celestial jaws, which we argue below are indicated by the two anthropomorphic jaw bones on the Yugüe flute, are common in Formative period Mesoamerican art (Norman 1976; Smith 1984; see also Taube 1995) but do not appear in Zapotec art until the Classic (Marcus 1983d:137). The use of human-like teeth in celestial jaws occurs in Classic period Zapotec art (Urcid 2005b) but not in southern Mesoamerican art (Guernsey 2006: 79). Finally, the trefoil motif on the Yugüe flute closely matches Zapotec renditions of vegetation (Sellen 2007; Urcid and Winter 2003). We suspect that the mix of stylistic and iconographic conven- tions evident on the Yugüe flute is representative of a local artistic style, although defining such a style will require a larger icono- graphic database.

ICONOGRAPHY OF THE YUGÜE FLUTE The central figure on the flute bears elements pertaining to both pre-Columbian divinities that were not specifically representative death and fertility, embedding it within widespread Mesoamerican of death had skeletal permutations or features, including: rain, wind, and agriculture deity complexes (Nicholson 1971:414, Quetzalcoatl (Nicholson 1971:429, Figure 46), Cihuacoatl 416; Vail 2000). It is possible that the figure represents a human (Milbrath 1996), the Cihuateteo and Tzizimime (Klein 2000), and in the midst of a ritual transformation, however most the creator gods in the Mixtec Codex Yuta Tnoho (Furst 1982: partially-skeletal male figures in Mesoamerican iconography have 209; Jansen and Pérez Jiménez 2007:71, Figure 3.2). 3 A Late been interpreted as depictions of a death god analogous to Aztec Formative period (400 b.c.–a.d. 250) example comes from Izapa Mictlantecuhtli (Bernal et al. 1968:26; Byland 1993; Gutiérrez Stela 50 (Norman 1973:Plate 50; 1976:145, Figure 3.35), on Solana and Hamilton 1977:41, Figure 1; Jansen 1981:110, which an umbilicus extending from the rib cage of a skeleton is Figure 5; Schellhaus 1904; Taube 1992).

Figures descending from celes- tial jaws with a rotated head and extended arm are common in later Zapotec and Mixtec art (Caso 2002:296, 299; Hermann Lejarazu 2008:53, 57; Marcus 1983a:194, Figure 7.4; Urcid 2005b: 126–127). In addition, the skeletal figure would have appeared in a descending position when the instrument was held in the bell- down playing position. Because it is a vertical flute, the Yugüe flute could be played most comfortably with the bell of the instru- ment pointing towards the ground (Barber et al. 2009). Although playing postures are in part culturally defined, the Dresden Codex provides a pre-Columbian depiction of the bell-down playing position for an external-duct flute (see Figure 8a). Of course a portable object can be moved, making it possible for the instrument’s player to place the central figure in a flying pos- ition (when the bell was parallel to the ground) or an ascending Figure 15.
