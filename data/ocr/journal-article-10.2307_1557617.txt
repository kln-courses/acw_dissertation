GRAY SWEENEY The last major exhibition of Frederic Edwin Church's work took place nearly a quarter of a century ago, and the first and still most original book on him, David C. Huntington's The Landscapes ofFrederic Edwin Church ( 1966, the same year as the exhibition), has long been out of print. The modest catalogue which accompanied the show, written by Huntington and Richard P. Wunder, is in marked contrast to the lavish publication for the 1989 exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, curated by Franklin Kelly. Moreover, there is a notable difference in format and interpretive stance between Kelly's recent study of Church and Huntington's seminal monograph. Kelly's book and catalogue, and numerous recent publications by other scholars, are impressive evidence of the radical shift to- ward the acceptance of Church's importance among his- torians of American art which has occurred during the long interval - nearly a generation-- between 1966 and 1989. Before David Huntington's rediscovery of Frederic Church for the twentieth century the painter who is today regarded as the greatest American landscape painter of the Hudson River School had been virtually ignored. To- day Church's works set records on the art market (his Home by the Lake sold for more than eight million dollars just a few months before the National Gallery's show opened), and a general recognition of his extraordinary artistic genius and a flourishing of scholarship on him 25</page><page sequence="2">have established his reputation as a painter of such major importance that even the National Gallery found it im- possible to secure loans so that the exhibition could travel beyond Washington. Kelly's valuable critical study and his profusely illustrated catalogue will serve a useful pur- pose in further stimulating contemporary absorption with Church. Kelly's stated intention in his study is to "appreciate Church and his art in a way that, at least in some measure, approximates the point of view held by his contempor- aries" (vii). With its rich leavening of citations to archival material, uncovered by Kelly and others, Frederic Edwin Church and the National Landscape contributes significantly to our understanding of Church and offers important insights into the artist's work. An especially welcome complement to the literature on the painter is an appen- dix containing a selection of reviews and notices of the painting Twilight in the Wilderness. In his monograph Kelly limits himself primarily to a discussion of Church's paintings of the North American landscape. While this thematic emphasis gives him an opportunity to comment usefully on many of Church's paintings, it raises other problems about the larger context of the artist's work, which ranged widely from South America to the Arctic to Europe. Anyone familiar with Church's oeuvre will be perplexed, for instance, by the very abbreviated discussion of Niagara (1857), one of the two or three works by which the painter was best known. Kelly's dismissal of Niagara as having "little direct rele- vance to [Church's] other depictions of the North Ameri- can landscape" (p. 94) will disturb anyone familiar with exegeses of the painting by Jeremy E. Adamson and David Huntington.' The first chapter establishes the crucial importance of Church's early study with Thomas Cole and convincingly demonstrates some of the ways in which Church, in order to serve a new and fundamentally more nationalistic purpose, adapted and enlarged the vocabulary of land- scape symbolism and associations established by Cole.2 Cole's belief in the higher moral authority of landscape painting inspired Church to paint historical, allegorical, and pastoral landscapes influenced by Cole, and in this he was attempting to surpass his teacher. One recognizes here a recent trend toward seeing many close similarities between Church's oeuvre and that of Cole, although it can be argued that Kelly does not always take this art- historical approach to a satisfactory conclusion. Kelly also sets up a dialectical paradigm, which he returns to throughout his study, when he says that in his early landscapes Church "was avoiding, whether con- sciously or not, what was the key dilemma facing any interpreter of American nature in the 1840s: the recog- nition of the inherent, unavoidable conflict between the growth and expansion of American civilization and the preservation of American wilderness" (p. 11). Kelly's discussion of Church's interest in American progress, par- ticularly as manifested in the guise of sawmills and simple industries, and his linking of Church's family's financial interests to such technologies are important contributions ,r?

In the next chapter, "Landscapes of Deeper Associa- tion," Kelly discusses Church's first fully mature work, West Rock, New Haven, and lays out the complex of as- sociations such a work evokes. Much of Kelly's inter- pretation is already familiar from an article by Christo- pher Kent Wilson published in 1986.' Kelly's extended discussion of Twilight, "Short Arbiter 'Twixt Day and Night" is at once enlightening in its probing of this ambiguous work and problematic because he is unable fully to ex- plain Church's momentary shift from optimism to pes- simism- if it is to be viewed as a shift at all. Admirable as this discussion may be, there is more that can be said about the means by which Church incorporated and re- directed Cole's art into his own aesthetic and icono- graphic vocabulary, and surely the biographical, histori- cal, and cultural context in which Twilight, "'Short Arbiter" was created could be made more evident. Kelly is on firmer ground in his discussion of Church's history paint- ing The Deluge and the seascape Beacon Off Mount Desert Island, which he considers as virtual pendants, the one historical, "the ideal," and the other, Beacon, expressive of "the real." Here, as with Twilight, "Short Arbiter, " Kelly's seeming ambivalence about how to explain such works again appears. After a lengthy discussion of Beacon stressing its qualities as an "emblem of safety" - an image of the New World washed clean of the mistakes of the Old World by the Deluge - Kelly concludes that such an "apparently undidactic picture" could also be "quietly suggestive of deeper content" (p. 42). Although Kelly all 26</page><page sequence="3">but gives us a symbolic reading of Beacon there remains a hesitancy on his part to break with the aim of perceptual realism toward which he envisions Church's work mov- ing and which he believes is first apparent in Beacon. While this reluctance occasionally deflects him from fath- oming Church's paintings at their deepest level of as- sociative meaning, his discussion of Beacon goes well be- yond anything previously published. In the third chapter Kelly's analysis of Church's key early work New England Scenery clearly shows its debt to David Huntington, yet adds important factual details and interpretive nuances to the 1966 study. Indeed, through- out the book Kelly acknowledges that Huntington's "original view of the painter remains the fundamental point of departure for all subsequent scholars" (viii). This said, however, Kelly's diffidence as to what interpretive approach to adopt appears again when he states that after New England Scenery "Church painted no more allegorical or imaginary works, for he had found the means to endow pure landscape with the elevated meanings he believed essential to his art" (p. 58). While this statement may have some validity, notwithstanding Kelly's own expli- cation of Our Banner at Dawn and The Star in the East, it seems strikingly at odds with the complex interpretation Kelly proposes for Twilight in the Wilderness with its wil- derness crucifix, emblematic trees, American eagle, nat-- ural cathedral in the sky, and allusions to the chosen people wandering in the wilderness guided by divine lights. Such a sweeping statement seems patently con- trary to analyses of paintings such as The Heart of The Andes or The Icebergs by David Huntington and Gerald L. Carr, works which one would be hard pressed to term anything but imagined spectacles. At the very least it raises again the question of where one draws the line between the imaginary and the real in Church's art. Kelly provides an interpretative gloss on Home by the Lake else- where in the chapter, arguing that it may be considered as a sequel to New England Scenery and that it may have been conceived by Church as a pendant to his marine The Wreck. The chapter "The Pastoral Ideal" is one of the most original parts of his book. It is broadly conceived as a foil to the following chapters in which Kelly asserts that, having succeeded in elevating the cultivated or agrarian landscape to the realm of high art, Church could turn to the more important concern of fashioning a wilderness aesthetic. Kelly convincingly demonstrates how in Mount Ktaadn Church "constructed a richly symbolic landscape that speaks of a world to come rather than a world that is" (p. 69). Invoking Thoreau and Theodore Winthrop (with whom Church traveled to Maine in 1856) Kelly shows how Church completely transformed the scene from a wilderness to "a vision of an America that had reached a peaceful accommodation between the needs of progress and the needs of preserving the heritage of the land itself, a nation poised between its own past, as embodied in the 'primal continent,' and its future, as predicted by the arrival of civilization" (p. 74). Kelly properly indicates how such a painting would have ap- pealed to its patron, the wealthy financier and business- man Marshall O. Roberts, as a confirmation of belief in the prosperous future of the young nation. He is less convincing in the discussion that follows in which he asserts that Church's experience of South America in 1853 transformed the artist's vision of North America and his art in general. For although he provides several important examples of how an interdiscriplinary per- spective can enrich understanding of Church, as in his discussion of the factory cupola in Mount Ktaadn, he re- mains curiously silent about the relevant political and cultural circumstances which led the artist to travel to South America and to paint it for his North American audience. Such a perspective would not only invoke the important, well-recognized influence of Alexander von Humboldt but the contemporary political and economic preoccupation with South and Central America that was so much a part of American imperial expansion in the era of manifest destiny. Kelly's chapters "Toward a Wilderness Aesthetic" and "The Stillness of Twilight and the Solemnity of Undis- turbed Primeval Nature: Twilight in the Wilderness," pro- vide the background to and culminating discussion of Church's apocalyptic image of the American wilderness. This is the principal image toward which the text is the- matically directed. He elaborates on the widely shared view of many scholars that Twilight in the Wilderness is "one of [Church's] greatest works" and an "undisputed masterpiece of American painting" (p. 102). He provides a lengthy exegesis of this one "Great Picture," and in this approach he is following a well-established trend - sev- eral recent exhibitions and studies have isolated key works by Church for extended treatment.4 Kelly maintains that Twilight in the Wilderness "may be seen to address many of the key issues facing the Ameri- can nation at the close of the 1850s" (p. 116). He thinks the work expresses a northeastern bias in favor of wil- derness preservation, pitting "the eastern intelligentsia against the expansionist settlers of the Midwest and West" (p. 117). A central part of this conflict was the emerging sectional and ideological discord between North and South. Kelly is undoubtedly correct in reasoning that Twilight in the Wilderness and the closely related image Our Banner in the Sky partially reflect Church's keen awareness of the disturbing background of contemporary sectional dis- cord. Kelly states that "Twilight in the Wilderness may thus be seen as representing the nation on the eve of civil war, whereas Our Banner in the Sky represents the morning of the war itself" (p. 119). It is the religious content of Twilight to which Kelly devotes the most attention. He points out the tiny cross of splintered wood on top of a blasted stump in the left foreground and then associates this deliberate symbol with the placing of manmade crosses in the wilderness by early missionaries as a means of converting Native Americans to Christianity. This type of symbolism, first introduced by Cole as early as 1828 and used repeatedly throughout his career is, however, much more than a symbol of personal worship and devotion, as I have shown 27</page><page sequence="4">,, ~Y.. r? ?:I ?: ?It*li~L~i I.~f" \cr*F~3U~I1F~J~f*r *55p?:??. rrn :* ~f~ ?. 2*e '''*.'**r. )~*ji~I* -;;-9Wl~slPIU~- ~Esu.l* *' :;*r~? :al-*~errauru~7e~u?;. n~c~ .: *,.,.. ** 1 -*3~ .a~c~ :*? *r?? ?* :f:i :C f, *** :? -?z Ibt ?~?? ??????? -"*"* **1 *J?~*- a Ux~~a~C~C"CI-~ -u~~rj~YI~t~~t?': r???rr- **~L?r* ?: ~" "?1" ' ItE'lYt~~ IW .f*: '** ''?''* 2. c " i. ,*" .

''t ?ci Frederic Edwin Church, Twilight in the Wilderness, 1860. Oil on canvas, 40 x 60 in. The Cleveland Museum of Art, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Marlatt Fund. in a recent article.5 Kelly notes that the phrase "twilight in the wilderness" would have had special resonance for Church's contemporaries, and indeed one reviewer ob- served that there were "pillars of fire gleaming below the surface of the water" (p. 121). Such associations between the ordeal of the Children of Israel wandering in the Wilderness and the imminent violence faced by a nation on the threshold of a civil war would have been readily understood by Church's contemporaries. I would argue, however, that the typological allusions which permeate Twilight go beyond this to invoke crucial associations with "the ordinance of the firmament," and that Church de- picts, in an anthropomorphic and emblematic form, the face of God in the radiant sky. It may be that Kelly's evident indisposition to admit the presence of anthro- pomorphic features in the painting is reflected in his con- clusion that Twilight in the Wilderness constitutes an "un- resolved spiritual drama" (p. 123). Kelly's final chapter "The Waning of the National Landscape" proves somewhat disappointing. Surely the complex reasons why landscape painting declined in popularity after the Civil War, and especially the reasons why Church so rapidly faded from public appreciation, merit more than a perfunctory discussion. Indeed, Church's Coast Scene, Mount Desert of 1863 and Mount Desert Island, Maine of 1865 are images hardly less rich in symbolism than Twilight in the Wilderness. The nationalistic ico- nography which Kelly thoughtfully draws out of Church's works leading up to the great picture of 1860 is also recognizable in these later paintings, although Kelly sum- marily disposes of them with an uncharacteristic formalist precis. In fact, the deer venturing forth from the clearing in Mount Desert Island, Maine, is anything but "maudlin," as Kelly states (p. 126). It is an obvious allusion to the tiny but crucially important presence of drinking deer in Cole's Desolation of Empire from the series The Course of Empire- prime symbols of the next cycle of history which follow the end of a national armageddon. This omission is especially surprising since Kelly repeatedly and co- gently refers to The Course of Empire as a key metaphor for interpretations of Church's earlier works. Despite such complaints it would be not only unfair but also ungra- cious to single out this last chapter for extended criticism, because Kelly's monograph makes not only an important but in several instances original contribution to under- standing Church's paintings of the national landscape. Kelly's exhibition catalogue is another matter, offering three essays of incommensurate quality, one by a nonspe- cialist. Of the three, Kelly's is the most coherent, a syn- opsis of his monograph with additional observations, tak- ing particular note of Church's stylistic development. James Anthony Ryan, site director of Olana, has provided much new, unpublished information on the construction, deco- ration, and furnishing of Church's great farm-villa- studio on the Hudson, in "Frederic Church's Olana: Ar- chitecture and Landscape as Art." Ryan's study is a useful complement to the iconographic studies which appear in Huntington's book and more recent study of the site.6 28</page><page sequence="5">Stephen Jay Gould's essay "Church, Humboldt, and Dar- win: The Tension and Harmony of Art and Science" recapitulates well-known material and is surely the least successful of the three, focusing on the Darwinian revo- lution and overlooking other aspects of science which Church was deeply interested in, particularly geology, meteorology, and optics. Deborah Rindge has contributed a chronology of the painter's life and an annotated text of Charles Dudley Warner's unfinished biography which resonates with now lost primary source material. Curi- ously, little use is made in the catalogue of this valuable document. One might also quibble with Kelly's having elected to exclude Church's impressive oil sketches from the exhibition - a selection would have given a fuller and richer appreciation of Church's achievement, and it is unfortunate that they are only used here as supplemen- tary illustrations. Kelly is nonetheless to be congratulated for his mono- graph, and especially for succeeding in the very difficult task of bringing together in a single exhibition forty-nine of Church's finest works. This exhibition and the accom- panying publication will serve as important stimuli for the growing community of scholars currently working to refine our knowledge of Church's art and its art-historical context.' Perhaps the major problem in Kelly's presen- tation of Church is that he does not respond to ideas advanced by David Huntington since the publication of his book in 1966. Kelly's conversancy with the impor- tance of typology in Church's art is conspicuously limited, and he seems reluctant to acknowledge the expressive role of anthropomorphic imagery in the artist's work.8 Be that as it may, Franklin Kelly's ambitious efforts come as a welcome and timely contribution to our broadening understanding of Church's rich and complex art. Both his monograph and the exhibition catalogue will be nec- essary for the library of any student of nineteenth-century American art. NOTES 1. See Jeremy E. Adamson, et al., Niagara: Two Centuries of Changing Attitudes, 1697-1901 (Washington, D.C.: Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1985), and David C. Huntington, "Frederic Church's Niagara: Nature and the Nation's Type," in Texas Studies in Literature and Language 25 (Spring 1983): 100-138. Adamson's exhibition catalogue is not listed in Kelly's bibliography, although it is cited in the notes; Huntington's important article, in which he argues the fundamental importance of typology in Niagara, and by extension other paintings of North America by Church, is listed in the bibliography, but is not cited in the notes to Kelly's all- too-brief discussion of the great work. 2. Much of this material is familiar, having been published in Kelly and Gerald L. Carr's The Early Landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church, 1845- 1854 (Fort Worth, Tex.: Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, 1987), pp. 37-51 (the exhibition was held in 1984). 3. See Christopher Kent Wilson, "The Landscape of Democracy: Fred- eric Edwin Church's West Rock, New Haven," American Art Journal 18 (1986): 37. 4. Gerald L. Carr was the first, with his monograph Frederic Edwin Church: The Icebergs (Dallas, Tex.: Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, ca. 1980), followed by Jeremy Adamson's study Frederic Edwin Church's "Niag- ara ": The Sublime as Transcendence (Ph.D diss., University of Michigan, 1981), and Katherine E. Manthorne's exhibition catalogue Creation and Renewal: Views of Cotopaxi by Frederic Edwin Church (Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art, published by the Smithsonian In- stitution Press, 1985). Neither Adamson's nor Manthorne's catalogue is listed in Kelly's bibliography, and although Adamson's is cited in the notes, Manthorne's is not. 5. See my " 'Endued with Rare Genius': Frederic Edwin Church's To the Memory of Cole," Smithsonian Studies in American Art (Winter 1988), pp. 44-71. 6. See David C. Huntington, "Olana, the Center of the Center of the World," in Irving Lavin, ed., World Art, Themes of Unity and Diversity, Acts of the XXVIIth Congress of the History of Art, 1986 (University Park, Penn.: Pennsylvania State University Press for the National Gallery of Art, 1989). See also Gerald L. Carr's Olana Landscape (New York: Rizzoli, 1989) for a valuable interpretive perspective and rich photo- graphic documentation of the site. 7. The long-awaited publication of Gerald Carr's multi-volume study on the great range of Church's art at Olana will fill a major gap in our knowledge of the artist. Katherine E. Manthorne's recently published study Tropical Renaissance: North American Artists Exploring Latin America provides new insight into Church's work in the tropics, while John Davis's forthcoming study of American artists in the Near East promises to add considerably to understanding the later phase of Church's career. 8. One is perplexed by the fact, for instance, that Huntington's major essay "Church and Luminism: Light for America's Elect," in American Light is not cited in Kelly's bibliography, although it is briefly mentioned in the notes.
