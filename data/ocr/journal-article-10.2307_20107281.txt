<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Schwenger Still Life: A User's Manual "Still life," Norman Bryson has declared, "is the world minus its narratives or, better, the world minus its capacity for generating narrative interest" (60). Bryson links that narrative capacity to the human subject, which is evacuated by this genre devoted to objects: "Opposing the anthropomorphism of the 'higher' genres, it as saults the centrality, value and prestige of the human subject" (60).l Of course, still life might equally well be seen as an assault on the object, on the vexed philosophi cal problem of the thing-in-itself?an assault that must always fail, filtered as it is by perception and representation. In either case, the end of still life is silence: the object is mute, and narrative, it seems, must shatter against it. This sense of the "stillness" of still life is involved with another sense of the word, a lack of motion that Bryson argues is fatal to narrative: "The law of narrative is one of change: characters move from episode to episode, from ignorance to knowledge, from high estate to low or from low to high. Its generative principle is one of discontinuity: where states are continuous, homeostatic, narrative is helpless. But still life pitches itself at a level of material existence where nothing exceptional occurs: there is wholesale eviction of the Event" (61). These assumptions demand to be questioned, and with them the absolute sever ance of still life from narrative that they entail. It is far from self-evident, for one thing, that objects do not move through changes in time?we recall that Hans Chris tian Andersen's tin soldier, darning needle, and bottle neck take long, eventful jour neys. And even if an object is viewed as motionless, there is a paradoxical connection to event in that very viewing.

In "Art and Object hood," Michael Fried's essay on minimal sculpture, he criticizes its "theatricality," by which he means a disposition of the object designed to provoke (mental) events in temporal sequence. The stillness of an object, then, does not exclude the possibility of event. In literary narrative we often find a translation of "Event" from its capitalized, presumably external, sense to a mental event with its origin in objects. Particularly in the modern period, the encounter with an object moved, in certain authors' works, from the margins to the center of their narratives. Virginia Woolf, for instance, wel comed the techniques of James and Proust because they offered new possibilities for writing about things: "The mind is freed from the perpetual demand of the novelist that we shall feel with his characters. By cutting off the responses which are called out in the actual life, the novelist frees us to take delight... in things in themselves. We can see the strangeness of them only when habit has ceased to immerse us in them. . . . Then we see the mind at work; we are amused by its power to make pat terns" ("Phases of Fiction" 122). While the "things" referred to here are not confined to physical objects, the passage nevertheless depicts accurately Woolf 's own narra tion of objects, of which her work affords many examples: the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse ("I have to give an empty house ... all eyeless &amp; featureless with nothing to cling to" [Diary 3:76]); the baroque patterning of the mind in "The Mark on the Wall"; the uneasy relationship between human life and "the mystery of things" in The Waves (224; see McConnell, Webb); the obsession with bits of evoca tive debris in her curious short story "Solid Objects."2 Robert Kiely has even sug gested that an aesthetic of the still life underlies the whole of Jacob's Room. And indeed the stillness of Jacob's empty room, described at the end in exactly the same terms as in the middle, underscores the curious emptiness of his young life, full of conventional "event" but not of significance. Here the still life of the room sums up a certain stillness in the life of its occupant.3 An example of postmodern narrative that is built up almost entirely on the pro tagonist's relation to objects is Nicholson Baker's The Mezzanine. The novel's be ginning, middle, and end are all contained within an escalator ride up to the mezzanine offices where the narrator works. Along the way there are flashbacks, di gressions, and, above all, the narrator's meditations on his culture's artifacts: the overthrow of the paper straw by the plastic one; the history of stapler design; the pleasures of perforation; the physics of shoelace wear. Objects are stimuli, as well, for the mind's less rational associations: the sight of colorful magazines at the news stand below the escalator evokes "four distinct images ... in quick succession" (104), which are then numbered and narrated. The digressive nature of the book's contents is reflected in its form; it is copiously annotated, and at one point includes a long footnote about footnotes (121-23). While without "Event" in any traditional sense, this novel moves forward, escalator-like, through a continual unfolding of one topic out of another, and of thoughts out of things (Chambers).</page><page sequence="3">142 Peter Schwenger A certain stream of twentieth-century writing, then, deals with the ways we read objects?read them in the way that Val?ry described reading, as a continuous series of mental events that he compares to footnotes: "The attentive reading of a book is nothing but a continuous commentary, a succession of notes escaping from the inner voice" (183). Objects in this view are a text inciting mental events whose nature will often be narrative. This essay will consider the dynamics of this narrative generativity of objects through the work of Georges Perec, especially his Life: A User's Manual, arguably the most extreme example we have of a novel based in ob jects. As a kind of overture to Perec's concerns, though, I would first like briefly to consider the work of Daniel Spoerri?an artist contemporary with Perec in the Paris avant-garde scene of the sixties and seventies, whose work may well have influenced him. Spoerri not only "reads" objects in Val?ry's sense; he literally footnotes them, in a project undertaken in the early sixties and running to the present day. I When Spoerri began his Anecdoted Topography of Chance, he was already known for his "snare-pictures," which he explains as follows: "Objects found in chance positions, in order or disorder (on tables, in boxes, drawers, etc.) are fixed ('snared') as they are. Only the plane is changed: since the result is called a picture, what was horizontal becomes vertical. Example: remains of a meal are fixed to the table at which the meal was consumed, and the table hung on the wall" (205). His new project was a snare of a different kind. On October 17, 1961, at 3:47, Spoerri traced the objects on his cluttered studio table onto a map, with each object outlined and numbered. Under each number he "anecdoted" the object, describing it, recall ing the circumstances under which it was acquired and the uses to which it had been put, following whatever associations suggested themselves. This added a narrative element that had been missing, or at least less explicit, in his previous work. The map is described as a textual mediation in a wine-sodden conversation, captured on tape and later transcribed, between Spoerri and a friend: "Here on the wall, the snare-pic tures . . . everything is spectacular and visible to the maximum, you see bread, you see things that stand out, volumes, all kinds of things that extend beyond the shape, and all that, but in the other, in the outline, it would be completely different... well, like the subconscious and the conscious, you know, you'll only see numbers, nothing at all, and you will read ... a novel . . . before a top?lo ... a topographic map of chance" (Anecdoted Topography 79-80). The reference to a novel becomes more co herent a few minutes later: "You can say a lot about a cigarette butt, a mere cigarette butt, you could have a whole novel under it" (80); indeed, this seems to have been the premise of The Mezzanine. At the time the Topography was published, some readers connected it to the novels of Robbe-Grillet, which Spoerri found unread able.4 But the novel with the closest affinities to this digressive, associative work is probably Tristram Shandy. For each of the numbered anecdotes is capable of gener ating others. When Spoerri's friends Emmett Williams and Dieter Roth translated the work</page><page sequence="4">Still Life in Narrative 143 in successive editions (the latest is 1995), they added their own annotations, in re sponse to him and to each other. While Spoerri and Williams provide an ever expanding net of anecdotes, Roth's annotations have a different quality?surreal, playful, half-immersed in the subconscious, often metaphysical. An extended example is worth reproducing here, Roth's note to "No. 46a, Burnt match in ashtray": Commodities only rise up into the so-called consciousness when?on being thrown away, say?they fly past your eyes and their image flies into them and slips into your brain where it calls out its name (e.g., "Here's match!"). And when the discarded commodity summons its image and calls out its name up there in the brain, the person listens intently inside, or outside, and the person sees all manner of different things in the process?not just the falling match, for instance, but also sticks and stakes and staves and pillar-like objects and much more. And when he sees inside himself pillars he hears pillars simultaneously, and he hears pillars and killers and then he thinks for instance of thrillers and so on and so forth. These images, the images of discarded objects?with their trains of kindred images and sound behind them?sometimes have, or can have, a train that contains the whole world. (149) The discarding of which Roth speaks here is not necessarily literal; it is more broadly the slippage of the object out of the system within which its habitual value has been assigned, and which has prevented it from being apprehended ("Here's match!") or from initiating associations that may be quite far removed from the ob ject's official function. Now, though, the object becomes capable, through an asso ciative alchemy, of a very different function. In the following note, to "No. 47, White shirt button," Roth asserts that it is these trains arising from objects that artists use in order to make art; "then these become commodities once again" (150). This, of course, is what has happened in the course of making the Topography itself: it has become a commodity. So the last item to be annotated is uncharacteris tically paradoxical: 80. Cigarette burna on the first tracing of this Topography. a. Publisher's note (1966): Illustration is manufactured by carefully burning the bookb with a cigarette. b. Which book? (DR 1968) The Topography, which arose out of objects, is now itself an object, to be mapped on someone else's table. Its associative trains are not confined to those that are num bered and ordered (in all their disorder) within the book. With each new possessor, the book must evoke new associations?some material, some mental, as is always the case with the ambiguous object that is a book. If a book is always an object, though, we have learned from Spoerri's opus that an object, to its observer, can al ways become a book. The stillness of still life is always capable of generating narra tive motion.</page><page sequence="5">144 Peter Schw enger II In 1973 Georges Perec begins a project that echoes Spoerri's. His brief essay "Notes Concerning the Objects that are on my Work-Table" is not completed until 1976; Perec observes how many of the objects on the table have changed from those that were there when he began writing. And yet what we have are still only notes, notes towards something more complete which, at the essay's end, is cast in the fu ture tense: "Thus a certain history of my tastes will come to be inscribed in this pro ject. . . . More precisely, it will be ... a way of talking about my work, about my history and preoccupations, an attempt to grasp something pertaining to my experi ence, not at the level of its remote reflections, but at the very point where it emerges" (Species 143). The autobiographical element emphasized here coexists in the "Notes" with a certain self-consciousness about writing. For instance: about a tube of glue which is not on the table top but in a drawer to the side, Perec writes, "I put it there a moment ago after using it. I could have left it on my work-table, but I put it away almost automatically (I say 'almost' because, since I've been describing what there is on my work-table, I am paying closer attention to my movements)" (Species 141). Here he is writing about the self-consciousness generated by the very writing in which he is currently engaged. This is the beginning of a reflexivity that will be come more marked in another description of his worktable, written five years later. That later piece is "Still Life / Style Leaf." It describes a different desk and dif ferent objects upon it; but the crucial difference is the physical presence on the desk of the sheet of paper on which has been written the preceding inventory of objects, an inventory that must now be recited again. Here is that recursive moment: "In the foreground, standing out clearly against the black fabric of the table, lies a sheet of 874 x ll3/4 ruled paper that is almost entirely covered with overly compact hand writing, and on which can be read: the lacquered wood desk on which I am writing, formerly a jeweler's workbench, is equipped with four large drawers" (302). And the beginning of the essay begins again. To this point we have a classic mise en abyme, which could be prolonged through an infinite series of embedded and receding ver sions of itself. Perec, however, enacts only one repetition, putting the period to an essay that is theoretically interminable as follows: "In the foreground, standing out clearly against the black fabric of the table, lies a sheet of 8V4 x 113/4 lined paper that is almost entirely covered with overly compact handwriting, and a gilt metal foun tain pen whose shaft and cap are covered from end to end with fine striations" (305). This resolution of the reflexive paradox poses a paradox of its own. If the pen is now at rest, resting on the paper as it was not in the first inventory, it is presumably the pen with which Perec has just finished writing; but with what, then, was this final sentence written? In the initial recursive moment there is also an oddness to the physical operation of writing: Perec, we realize, must now be copying his own words from the top of the page onto its bottom. A split is enacted here and, indeed, through out the whole essay. We see that split already in the title (which is English in the original). A slash divides the objects of still life from their literary description: the leaf of a book, the</page><page sequence="6">Still Life in Narrative 145 style of a writer. And style, Philippe Bonnefis tells us, is related to time: "Style is dated, it temporizes. The truth, stylized, is still itself, but at an interval's remove" (170). In Perec's essay, that interval's difference is cast into relief. For in contrast to the classic mise en abyme, the description does not replicate itself the second time around. True, the objects described remain the same; however, the time on the clock has changed, as has the "word" formed out of numbers on the calculator screen. These alert the reader to more changes, so subtle as to be negligible: "The solid wood desk" has become "the lacquered wood desk"; "a brass fish" becomes "a gilt metal fish"; "a piece of thin cardboard" becomes "a square of thin cardboard"; and so on. There are fifty changes in all, tabulated by Bernard Magn? in his cogent analy sis of this work. The changes may be negligible, but the point they make is not: a writer does not only screen the object with a thickness of words but creates it as the "mental event" of representation. In Perec's first essay about the objects on his work table, that men tal event is explicitly intended to be narrative: much as in Spoerri's work, the objects evoke autobiographical reflections. The mental event of the later essay is description, and the essay's paradoxical structure is designed to call into question the assumption that there is a direct correspondence between a description and the object described.5 While the table and the objects upon it are not the same, the subject matter of both essays is a still life; yet it seems that one still life is narrative, the other descriptive. This should make the two essays irreconcilable opposites, according to some theo reticians. G?rard Genette is representative: "Narration attaches itself to actions and events considered as pure processes, and thereby places the accent on the temporal and dramatic aspect. . . . [Description, on the contrary, since it lingers over objects and beings considered in their simultaneity, and since it envisages processes them selves as spectacles, seems to suspend the course of time and tends to spread out nar ration in space" ("Fronti?res" 158). Gerald Prince makes the same distinction in the Dictionary of Narratology: "Description is the representation of objects, situations, or (nonpurposeful, nonvolitional) happenings in their spatial rather than temporal ex istence, their topological rather than chronological functioning, their simultaneity rather than succession" (19). This neat division, echoing Lessing's, has become con siderably less neat in recent years. The perception of objects takes time, it has been pointed out (Casey 192; Ch?telain 132), as does the reading of their representations. And narrative's events require some form of description if they are to exist at all (Casey 192). Moreover, the widespread notion of narrativity as meaning-imposing structure becomes an insufficient distinguishing characteristic as soon as we admit that the ordering of a description also proceeds according to models of meaning, ei ther commonly accepted ones or those specific to the present work: "In fact, every descriptive explication ... produces a gain in meaning" (Hamon 263; qtd. and trans lated in Ronen 280). For such reasons it has been argued that the opposition between description and narration should be abandoned, or at least rethought in less rigid terms: "Just as we must reject any attempt to reduce description and narration to each other ... so we must also abjure the false dichotomizing to which these terms are all too often subject" (Casey 200; see also Ronen passim).</page><page sequence="7">146 Peter Schw enger III Putting into question the relation between description and narration need not be the exclusive concern of literary theory; it may also be the project of literary practice. This is perhaps nowhere so true as in the Perec novel that appeared between his first and second essays about the still life of his work table. Life: A User's Manual (La Vie mode d'emploi) was published in 1978; Perec had begun the actual writing of this novel, for which he had been assembling material for years, in 1976?the same year in which he wrote "Notes Concerning the Objects that are on my Work-table." The entire novel is, as we shall see, a version of still life.6 Yet it is not generally read through the objects so extensively delineated there. One reason for this is a certain deception practiced by Perec from the start. "Look with all your eyes, look" is the novel's epigraph, taken from Jules Verne's Michael Strogoff. The nature of this look ing is the subject of the epigraph to the "Preamble" on the next page: "The eye fol lows the paths that have been laid down for it in the work." In Paul Klee's Pedagogical Sketchbook, from which this sentence is taken (33), the referent is the picture's composition. Perec applies it here to the art of the jigsaw puzzle, the way that the best puzzle makers anticipate the solver's reasoning in order to lay traps. Ac cordingly, critics have often approached the novel as an intricate puzzle to be worked out, an approach that for Perec was entirely natural: "It's a novel with which one plays, I believe, as one plays with a puzzle," he said (Perec and Simony 79).7 That puzzle might just as easily be a crossword puzzle as a jigsaw, since the novel is laid out in squares: the squares are the rooms of a cross-sectioned Paris apartment build ing. Each chapter describes the contents of one of the rooms. Those contents may in clude people subjected to the same impassive gaze as objects, people treated like objects. And each chapter includes a narrative element, telling us the history of the room's furnishings and their relation to the room's occupant, and at times telling us about the people depicted in the art on the walls: objects treated like people. The squares that make up the cross-sectioned apartment building could also be seen to make up a chessboard, for Perec demands of himself that the transition from one room to another be accomplished by way of the knight's move in chess. In the rules of Perec's game each chapter had to adhere to forty-two constraints, corresponding to the same number of lists. These lists were composed of such things as authors who had to be quoted; types of printed material such as newspapers, catalogs, and theatre programs that had to be interpolated; references to his own works; numerical allu sions to the chapter's position on the grid; and so on.8 And yet in his own explication of this aspect of the novel, "Quatre Figures pour La Vie mode d'emploi," he rather dismissively calls it "a scaffold that took two years to set up, and that only served to pump up my imagination" (53). We may thus be wary of the "puzzle" mode of read ing this novel and of the puzzle maker himself: Perec reminds us in the "Preamble" that it is the business of the puzzle maker to lay traps. The "Preamble" itself may be a trap of the kind Perec describes: it is a piece of the whole that seems to fit perfectly here at the novel's frame, a kind of edge piece. But this is to give it a value that may be misleading when we realize that the piece is also found verbatim within the novel as the first part of Chapter 44. Perec reminds us</page><page sequence="8">Still Life in Narrative 147 (twice) that "in isolation, a puzzle piece means nothing"; thus the isolation of this piece as "Preamble" may be laying down a misleading path to be followed. For it is dangerous to assign too much weight to any one piece: "the parts do not determine the pattern, but the pattern determines the parts." What enables us to solve a jigsaw puzzle, or any of the puzzles of our existence, is, according to Perec, an overall Gestalt. Life: A User's Manual is to be approached the same way. The intricate de lights of its gamesmanship, its allusions, and its secret jokes are variations on two grand themes: physical objects and life narratives. The lives of the building's inhabitants and the objects that fill their rooms have equal prominence in the memories of Serge Val?ne, who has a pivotal role in the novel. A painter who occupies a small room tucked up near the roof, he has lived in the building longer than anyone else. His memories take the form of an ubi sunt lament not just for people but for things: "Where were they now, the Van Houten cocoa tins, the Banania cartons with the laughing infantryman, the turned-wood boxes of Madeleine biscuits from Commercy? Where were they gone, the larders you used to have beneath the window ledge, the packets of Saponite" (61). This litany of mourning continues at some length; for these are the "imperceptible details which over the course of fifty-five years had woven the life of this house and which the years had unpicked one by one" (61). We learn that, as a memento, Val?ne plans to paint a picture of the building that will open to view all of its rooms. In his plan ning he continues to brood both upon the people within the rooms and the objects within them, "the tranquil life of things" (128). It is in the relation between these that we find "all those infinitesimal gestures in which the life of a flat is always most faithfully encapsulated" (128). Val?ne's dual obsession reaches a peak in "The Fifty First Chapter"?so titled (Le Chapitre LI), rather than "Chapter Fifty-One," in an ex ception to the format used for the other chapters. Here Val?ne sketches out, if only in his mind, the painting he intends to execute. He will be depicted in it, painting him self in the process of painting himself in a mise en abyme: "He would paint himself painting, and already you would be able to see the ladles and knives, the serving spoons and door handles, the books and newspapers, the rugs, jugs, fridges, umbrella stands" (227). This list proceeds for a full page through increasingly specific objects linked to their individual owners, concluding "and all around the long procession of his characters with their stories, their pasts, their legends" (228). What follows is a list of 179 narratives found within this novel, each summarized within one line of 60 spaces, the last of which is "Lonely Val?ne putting every bit of the block onto his canvas" (233). The fact that these narratives are "all around" (tout autour) the cata log of objects is significant. It chimes with Perec's statement elsewhere that "I would always be on the side of language that surrounds things" (Schwartz 116 my transla tion). This should not be taken too readily as the common notion that all objects are framed by narrative. Rather, the things come first. Accumulating associations and ex periences as they pass through various hands, objects become the custodians of nar ratives to correspond, which emanate from them like an aura. While Val?ne and Perec might seem to represent antithetical modes (image ver sus word, or more specifically within literary theory, description versus narrative), they have in common a mania for listing. Val?ne's lists of objects, then of the narra</page><page sequence="9">148 Peter Schw enger tives attached to objects, are matched by the forty-two lists that went into the scaf folding of Life: A User's Manual. Indeed, the whole novel has the structure of a list: each room is an item on that list, and a chapter in the novel; further, within each chapter the objects in the room are listed. Narratives are attached to these objects, but the narrative movement of the novel is not confined to such autonomous stories. There is an overall narrative movement that arises out of the descriptive and that is related precisely to the novel's status as a list. For Philippe Hamon the "list-effect" is the fundamental trait of the descriptive (66); yet it is not so fundamental that it can wholly differentiate description from narrative. Daniele Ch?telain, for example, in her study of the iterative, admits the pertinence of iteration to description but also sees its pertinence to narrative: "A more radical example of what I call 'narrative' could be a list of disparate objects, juxtaposed and existing simultaneously, where these would be passed in review, one after another, in singulative manner. This in fact would be to call 'narrative' that which others call 'descriptive'" (133). Patti White underscores even more strongly the affinities of the list with the narrative system: In fact, the narrative "system" is a supersystem, a union of relatively au tonomous systems that interact in the creation of the conceptual construct "nar rative." Each system in the union interacts horizontally and vertically with other systematic entities, and each is relationally constituted and relationally consti tutive at the same time. In this figuration of narrative, the list is a systematic component that is itself constructed by operations functionally identical to those operative at the supersystemic level; in this figuration, the list is the narra tive in a structurally profound and systemically elegant sense. (3-4) This functional congruence of narrative and list is exemplified precisely by Perec's rooms and their listed contents, which combine, piece by piece, into a narrative "su persystem." Whether the contents of a room are thought of as being described or listed is a matter of pace. Perec will often provide an enumerated list of the paintings in a room; because he lingers on the details of each painting, though, the sense of de scription prevails over the enumeration. Conversely, an intensely descriptive phrase within a rapidly shifting sequence is assimilated into the rhythm of the list. So Val?ne imagines a series of layers descending beneath the building with, at one point, "flint-bottomed boats, punts weighted with empty barrels sailing across a lightless lake, bestridden by phosphorescent creatures shuffling indefatigably from shore to shore with hampers of dirty laundry, complete sets of dishware, knapsacks, cardboard boxes fastened with bits of string" (360).9 This Stygian description flick ers only briefly in Val?ne's layered list, and indeed generates a subsidiary list of its own. Such copiousness is part of the pleasure of listing, which Philippe Hamon links to the pleasure of collecting: "the pleasure of amassing, of exchanging, of constitut ing a series of objects that are 'equivalent' and at the same time different, of manag ing one's stocks, of stretching the series to saturation, of neutralising synchrony and diachrony" (Introduction 73).</page><page sequence="10">Still Life in Narrative 149 If Val?ne's painting is a version of Perec's novel,10 then it is worth paying special attention to the paintings that are described in that novel. They are nearly all realistic and narrative?which is hardly in step with the fashions of either art or inte rior decoration in 1975, when the novel is set. This allows Perec to foreground the aspect of representation that so troubled Plato, its reduplicative nature. The painting, an object in itself, seems to open up into other objects?and this goes so far as to in clude human beings and the stories that attach to their postures. The depiction of ob jects in a painting is of course a still life, and these representations are re-represented by Perec. Madame de Beaumont is even reading a book about still life, entitled Ars Vanitatis, which is open at "one of the celebrated Vanities of the Strasbourg school" (137). The moral point intended by the delusory depiction of luxurious objects may be intended by Perec too, and would account for the unlikely and extreme luxury of many of the furnishings described. Still lifes also appear as incidentals in other kinds of paintings?they are parerga which are not the painting's subject but which are more than mere ornament. Thus, a portrait entitled The Venetian Woman includes "a silver dish containing a bunch of flowers, an amber rosary, and a casket of old, yel lowish ivory, overflowing with golden sequins" (104). These luxurious objects, as the vanitas tradition stresses, are delusory?but they may at least be pinpointed to a specific location on the canvas. The case is dif ferent with narrative painting, where the story is always elsewhere than the canvas and what is depicted on it. Some of the stories are so familiar that simply to describe the scene depicted is enough to evoke the narrative: when a young lady has dropped her handkerchief on a Paris street and a young man is shown rushing to pick it up (105), we do not assume that his goal is the handkerchief. However, for most of the narrative paintings found on the walls of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier a description is inadequate or downright baffling. What are we to make of a picture that includes, among other things, a man in fancy dress uniform reading a letter "with an expres sion of utter dismay on his face" (221); a woman in Quaker dress holding a jar of pickles under her arm; a man dressed in a medieval Fool's costume and another dressed as a fat baby? Turning to the title?The Murder of the Goldfish?compounds the confusion, which is only cleared up by narrating the convoluted detective story that is the painting's subject. Narrative explanations are often forced to go beyond the painting itself to the circumstances of its making. That a genre scene in a country railway station should be called The Rake's Progress is only explained by the fact that it is "allegedly simply one of the models for the set of an Anglo-French adapta tion in modern dress of Stravinsky's opera" (64). In the same flat, Rorschach's, are displayed nine plates decorated with, among other scenes, "a priest giving ashes to a believer, ... a woman sitting in the corner of a railway carriage, with her arm in a sling,... a man in a nightgown, holding a candlestick, looking at a spider, symbolis ing hope, on the wall" (63). Nothing within these depictions tells us that the common bond between them is that they are the background for the credits of a television se ries in which the same actor played a variety of roles. Near the end of the novel we are presented with equally heterogeneous images in a series of twenty-one uniformly framed engravings hung on one wall (463-64); this time, though, no explanation is given for their conjunction. When paintings call for explanatory narratives, then,</page><page sequence="11">150 Peter Schw enger these may be given or withheld?or both at the same time, in the case of improbable explanations (The Rake's Progress is "allegedly" a model). The narratives are sel dom wholly adequate to the objects, or subjects, depicted. Beyond the painting's frame, the inhabitants of the building are no less framed, depicted as they might appear in Val?ne's projected painting. Thus: "In the fore ground, a little to the right and sideways onto the window, V?ronique Altamont is sit ting" (437). Or: "In the foreground, partly occluding the last delivery man, a woman is leaving the building" (301). These are the terms that would be used to describe a painted representation of the scene?a scene that is, in a sense, also a still life. For the human subjects, even in the midst of their implied motion, have been stilled: Louise R?ol "stands on tiptoe beside a Louis XHI-style dresser, her arms out stretched to reach from the top shelf an earthenware plate" (41). This stillness is that of Val?ne's vision: "Sometimes Val?ne had the feeling that time had been stopped, suspended, frozen around he didn't know what expectation. The very idea of the pic ture he planned to do . . . gave him the impression of a grotesque mausoleum raised in the memory of companions petrified in terminal postures as insignificant in their solemnity as they were in their ordinariness" (127). In Life: A User's Manual, time has stopped at a few minutes to eight in the evening. It stays stopped throughout the novel until the very last pages. There, a final listing of the inhabitants of the building takes on the aura of a litany, largely through the threefold repetition of a suspended moment: "It is the twenty-third of June nineteen seventy-five, and it will soon be eight o'clock in the evening" (476). Then, with a slight variation, the sense of a slight movement: "in a moment it will be eight o'clock in the evening" (497). Then "It is the twenty-third of June nineteen seventy-five, and it is eight o'clock in the evening. Seated at his jigsaw puzzle, Bartlebooth has just died" (497). The still life of frozen time, then, is broken only to bring into existence that moment in which life is finally stilled. The reader of a novel, Walter Benjamin asserted, is looking for characters from which can be derived a "meaning of life." Yet the frame that shapes one's life is death, that line drawn under the years to reach their sum or summary. Therefore the reader "must, no matter what, know in advance that he will share [the characters'] experience of death: if need be their figurative death?the end of the novel?but preferably their actual one" (101). There are many deaths within Perec's novel, within the building that Val?ne thinks of for this reason as a "grotesque mausoleum." Bartlebooth's death sums up all the others, and the book. This is because the project of his lifetime is congruent with the overall metaphysical movement of the novel? the circularity of narrative that brings stories into being only to still them again. Cir cularity is indeed one of the guiding principles of Bartlebooth's life plan: "Its perfection would be circular: starting from nothing, passing through precise opera tions on finished objects, Bartlebooth would end up with nothing" (118). The plan is as follows: For ten years, from 1925 to 1935, Bartlebooth would acquire the art of painting watercolours. For twenty years, from 1935 to 1955, he would travel the world, painting, at</page><page sequence="12">Still Life in Narrative 151 a rate of one watercolour each fortnight, five hundred seascapes of identical format (royal, 65cm x 50cm) depicting seaports. When each view was done, he would dispatch it to a specialist craftsman (Gaspard Winckler), who would glue it to a thin wooden backing board and cut it into a jigsaw puzzle of seven hun dred and fifty pieces. For twenty years, from 1955 to 1975, Bartlebooth, on his return to France, would reassemble the jigsaw puzzles in order, at a rate, once again, of one puz zle a fortnight. As each puzzle was finished, the seascape would be "retex turised" so that it could be removed from its backing, returned to the place where it had been painted?twenty years before?and dipped in a detergent solution whence would emerge a clean and unmarked sheet of Whatman paper. (118-19) The nothing that Bartlebooth ends up with is not in accordance with this plan. How ever, it is in accordance with Perec's sense of the way that life deals with all plans, including those complicated plans on which his novel is built: "I know that if I clas sify, if I make inventories, somewhere there are going to be events that will step in and throw the order out. . . . That forms part of the opposition between life and the user's manual, between the rules of the game you've set yourself and the paroxysms of real life that submerge, that are continually undoing the work of setting in order? luckily, moreover" (Species 128). Bartlebooth's plan fails not only because of the depredations of age and blindness but because it runs up against another plan, that of his "specialist craftsman," Gaspard Winckler. At the conclusion of the novel's first chapter, the line of a plot (in two senses) is laid down: "Gaspard Winckler is dead, but the long and meticulous, patiently laid plot of his revenge is not finished yet" (6). It finishes, and finishes Bartlebooth, in the event described by the novel's last lines: "On the tablecloth, somewhere in the crepuscular sky of the four hundred and thirty ninth puzzle, the black hole of the sole piece not yet filled in has the almost perfect shape of an X. But the ironical thing, which could have been foreseen long ago, is that the piece the dead man holds between his fingers is shaped like a W" (497). But if this "could have been foreseen long ago," it would be by someone other than the reader: we have been given no motive for Winckler's long-meditated revenge. And the last piece of the puzzle is no easier for the reader to fit into place than for Bartle booth. Does the W stand for Winckler? Or is it an allusion to Perec's own charged as sociations with this letter, as explicated in his W, or the Memory of Childhood? Or is it a mirror image of M, as Perec's friend Jacques Roubaud suggests, the initial of the river Meander whose meeting with the sea is pictured in the puzzle?an impossible meeting, as he demonstrates (256)? Or, turned another way, is it Roubaud's own 8, title of his book of poems, a mathematical symbol that links an element to its set (Bellos 396)? These subtle associations may all be valid, aspects of a richly overde termined agency of the letter in the unconscious. We turn this last piece of the puzzle this way and that, try to fit it into an X that is the sign of an unknown quantity. In the end, as David Bellos puts it, W is "a one-letter summary of what remains when all is done" (634). This remainder is a falling short, an inability to put the whole puzzle together,</page><page sequence="13">152 Peter Schw enger either in this novel or in "life." What remains as well are the two fundamental ele ments out of which both, perhaps, are constructed: objects and narratives. Objects may be the custodians of our narratives, as Spoerri's Topography shows. There, nar ratives and explanations unfold out of objects, and out of each other, in a fertility that Spoerri and his friends celebrate. But the parodie annotation, which is continually being extended and supplemented, indicates an ever-receding remainder and a process interminable to the point of exhaustion. The narratives falter and fall silent; in that stillness, the objects remain. In Perec's novel, as well, objects remain as narrative passes away: "Objects re main. In the end it is they that survive, and through them, I would say, something that is profoundly moving" (Perec and Simony 79). The description of Bartlebooth's final stillness is preceded by an inventory of the contents of his room. The "assorted pile of miscellaneous books and objects" that fill his bookcase is of the same genre as the jumble of objects that fills the table between Holbein's ambassadors, already alluded to in the painting that Hutting is in the process of completing (278). This rich jumble seems to exemplify the power of possession, not only of objects but also of knowl edge. "Ownership is the most intimate relationship that one can have to objects," says Walter Benjamin, speaking of the collector. "Not that they come alive in him," he immediately cautions; "it is he who lives in them" (67). We are the ones pos sessed; our life is not our own, although we use it as if it were. And so, from a certain point of view, as in the Holbein painting, what stands out in Perec's novel is death. This is not, however, a death that will allow readers to sum up the "meaning of life" that Benjamin says they seek; no user's manual will be provided. The grand narrative of Perec's novelized list, like the individual narratives of which it is composed, emerges out of still life and returns in the end to stillness. Still life, as we have seen, can generate narrative, be bound up with narrative. Yet in the end, at its moment of ending, every narrative is stilled in a kind of objecthood. The line between still life and narrative thus traces a full circle, a circle that may also be a zero. ENDNOTES 1. Mark Seltzer, analyzing the still life in terms of the dynamics of consumption rather than of narrative, turns inside out the idea of the genre's "assault" on the human: "The still life ... necessarily excludes the human subject and the human body since it is precisely the human subject and the human body to which the still life at every point makes reference and pays homage" (473). 2. Woolf 's "Solid Objects" has recently come into its own as a touchstone text in the new object-based studies. See Brown; see also the chapter on Woolf in Mao 26-89. 3. The common designation of Woolf 's novels as "lyric" raises a problem beyond the one to which this essay addresses itself, though related to its concerns: can we distinguish between lyric's use of still life and narrative's use of it? Certainly the sequentiality that is foregrounded in so many attempts to characterize narrative is "stilled" in lyric. The lyric exists in a moment of time, albeit a complex one. Moreover, it often centers on the description of an object, as in Robert Frost's "Design." Lyric de scription, however, is not undertaken for its own sake but as an explicit or implicit stimulus to medi tation. We are then in the realm of "event" as Robert Morris might characterize it: a mental negotiation (not static) with an object (static) rather than a sequence of actions in the world. The ob</page><page sequence="14">Still Life in Narrative 153 ject in question may be as small as Tennyson's flower in the crannied wall, or as large as "life" in Woolf 's The Waves. Indeed, Woolf 's novel challenges our definitions of both narrative and lyric?as does the passage quoted above from "Phases of Fiction." This makes The Waves an appropriate test case for James Phelan's consideration, in the first chapter of Narrative as Rhetoric, of the relation be tween lyric and narrative. He distinguishes these not so much by the form of the material as by the at titudes elicited toward that material. Those attitudes need not be the same throughout: it could be argued that even conventional sequential narratives tend toward a complex emotional simultaneity in the mind of the reader as the book concludes. Viewed in a certain way, then, all narrative aspires to the condition of lyric?and consequently to the stilling of its narrative life. 4. About objects Robbe-Grillet has this to say: "Posited, from the start, as not being man, they remain constantly out of reach" {For a New Novel 70)?an assertion allied to Bryson's idea of still life as as saulting the centrality of the human subject. In a similar vein he writes, "If objects still afford a mo mentary prop to human passions, they will do so only provisionally, and will accept the tyranny of significations only in appearance?derisively, one might say?the better to show how alien they re main to man" (20-21). However, Robbe-Grillet later seems to reverse this position: "Even if many objects are presented and are described with great care, there is always, and especially, the eye which sees them, the thought which re-examines them, the passion which distorts them. The objects in our novels never have a presence outside human perception, real or imaginary" (137). This kind of con tradiction leads G?rard Genette, in his essay "Vertige fix?," to assert that Robbe-Grillet's subject is not objects at all, but time; objects are simply the necessary content of the perceiving consciousness. It is time, and not the object, that is fixed and stilled in Robbe-Grillet's work. This stillness is of a dif ferent kind from that considered in this essay as arising out of the material thing in its relations with narrative. 5. This contrast between the two essays is supported by Magn?'s close analysis. He counts 82 references to the first person singular in "Notes" and only two in "Still Life." As well, he contrasts the frequent and varied temporal references in "Notes" to the almost exclusive use of the present in "Still Life." 6. There is a continuity between Life: A User's Manual, Perec's last novel, and his first, Things: A Story of the Sixties. Things opens with a detailed description of the furnishings of a flat. Only gradually does the narrative begin to speak of the couple who lives there, who indeed define their lives by the objects that surround them, or by which they would like to be surrounded. The novel is a study of de sire, desire that tries to realize itself in the terms of a consumer society. Perec is not unsympathetic to his characters, who enact much of his own youthful life; their desires are his desires too. The novel closes in a future tense that promises a new life of realized abundance. Jerome and Sylvie, aboard a train heading to their new jobs, sit down to a meal that is the deceptive incarnation ofthat abundance: "The starched table linen, the solid cutlery engraved with the arms of the Compagnie des Wagons Lits, the weighty, emblazoned crockery will seem like the prelude to a sumptuous feast. But the meal they will be served will be quite simply tasteless" (126). These, the concluding lines of the novel, are a nature morte. Its rich textures, swiftly delineated, mask an emptiness that is in fact that of the char acters' lives. The real still life is the deadened one to which they are condemned, precisely through objects. 7. All translations from this interview are my own. 8. For more detail on Perec's intricate plan see his "Quatre Figures" and chapter 57 of Bellos. I would like here to acknowledge David Bellos 's helpfulness in reading an earlier draft of this essay. 9. This vision of the nether parts of a building harks back to Gaston Bachelard's Poetics of Space (17-25); taken with the grandiose plans of Marvell Houses International (Life: A User's Manual 422-35), it anticipates the hotels described in Steven Millhauser's Martin Dressier: The Tale of an American Dreamer. The "lightless lake" may be an allusion to the "sunless sea" included in that sub lime list, Coleridge's "Kubla Khan." 10. Val?ne's name is taken from a literary pseudonym that Perec had used earlier.</page><page sequence="15">154 Peter Schw enger WORKS CITED Bachelard, Gaston. The Poetics of Space.
