<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. By D. G. RITCHIE, WHEN Aristotle, after tracing the progress of human society from the patriarchal family to the city-state of the Hellenes, says that the city-state comes into being for the sake of life, but has its being for the sake of the good life, he gives an admirable illustration of a distinction which he is always ready to recognise between the origin of anything (its material cause-e ov') and its final cause (7e-Xog), i.e., the end which it comes to serve: this latter must be known if we are to know the true nature of a thing (' 8&amp; fnav-s' re7Xoq faw-). This distinction has not lost its significance, though it has been overlooked in many philosophical and other con- troversies. The question that sometimes arises in social ,circles which are careful of their dignity: "Who is so-and- so ? " is frequently solved by consultation of the peerage, or, -at a lower elevation, of some old lady: and the oracle answers by telling who his great-grandfather or great-grand- :mother was, the value of a man (or woman) for certain purposes of society being supposed to depend not on what he himself is, but on what some ancestor had the reputation of being. Pride of birth is, indeed, sometimes supported by the scientific doctrine of heredity, though it is apt to be -forgotten that the kind of eminence which has qualified men in times past for elevation to the peerage has not always been such as to make the transmission of it desirable in the interests of the whole social organism as that now is. And, further, it is forgotten that, if a man's great-great-grandfather was a really great person, the man is probably only in respect ,of #-, part of himself the hereditary representative of that ancestor. And, yet again, it is forgotten that not merely inherited capacity, but a favourable environment in which it can be exercised, is requisite for the production of the best type of individual; and that such favourable environment is not always provided by an atmosphere of adulation and the absence of the stimulus to industry. The popular respect for pedigrees involves to a great extent the confusion of origin and worth. "He is nobody" means, being trans- lated, he is without father or mother-of note: and when such a person really impresses the world, it is often found expedient to discover for him some dignified descent, in, order</page><page sequence="2">64 D. G. RITCHIE: to satisfy the popular prejudice. This prejudice has invaded more important spheres. The great men, not of Hellas only, came to be looked on as the sons of gods and demigods. People have found it difficult to believe that those whom they felt to be immeasurably above them, could be born of ordinary parents and according to the ordinary laws of human generation. There are many estimable persons who derive great com- fort from abusing metaphysics; and it is a pity that they should not be able to indulge their inclinations in a harmless way. Therefore it would be desirable if we could mark off a certain meaning of 'metaphysics' and 'metaphysical' in which they shall denote what is bad, reserving the liberty to employ these terms for something that is not only un- objectionable, but necessary. Let us say then that, from an Idealist point of view, we are ready to admit all the hard things that Comte has said of the old Ontologies, and to declare that we are as anxious as he to eliminate the influence of them from theory and practice; but that we consider such clearing of the ground will be even more ,effectually carried out, if we do not shirk an investigationl of the conditions under which knowledge and nature and con- duct are possible. Nay, we are prepared to argue that just those persons who disclaim metaphysics most are sometimes apt to be infected with the disease they profess to abhor- and not to know when they have it. One of the chief characteristics of the 'metaphysical' stage of thought is its anxiety to vindicate the value of moral and other ideas by tracing them back to an origin which can be regarded as in itself great and dignified, whether the greatness and dignity be such as come fromn the clearness of reason or, as is often supposed, from the dark- ness of mystery. Thus, the true religion has been repre- sented as a primitive revelation from which 'man afterwards fell away. "Degraded savages " have been supposed to be all degraded in the literal sense-degenerate from an origin- ally better condition. There has been a preference for regarding man " as a fallen archangel, not as an elevated ape ". The natural rights of man, i.e., those rights which it is felt man ought to have guaranteed to him in a well- ordered society, have been thought of, or at least spoken of, as if they had been originally possessed by him and stolen away by the wickedness of tyrants and oppressors. The poet uses the language of such "Vorstellungen" to express ideas:- and so we find Heine saying that the Holy Spirit</page><page sequence="3">ORIIN AND VALIDITY. 65 "renews ancient rights" (erneut das alte Becht). Reform h as been again and again brought in under the guise of restora- tion, sometimes indeed (as in the struggles of the English Parliament in the seventeenth century) with some degree of historical truth. So also with regard to the individual mind. Ideas, either in logic or in morals, which are of peculiar im- portance, have been called " innate ". They have been " implanted by God (or Nature) in our breasts ". We have only to look deep enough to find them beneath the super- imposed crust of prejudice, experience and conventional belief. The voice of God and Nature may be heard if we go back to primitive simplicity: and thus we have the " noble savage" of eighteenth century imagination and the pseudo- Platonisin of Wordsworth's " Ode on Intimations of Im- mortality from Recollections of Early Childhood ". But very little can be found by the searcher after primitive uncorrupted intuitions, either in the infant or in the savage, except what he manages to read into their undeveloped miilds out of his own theories. Yet the temptation is strong to regard the inexplicable (or at least the unexplained), the unanalysable (or at least the unanalysed), with peculiar veneration, and to feel jealousy and suspicion of any attempt to examine the elements and origin of anything that is valued or admired. " I ask not proud philosophy to teach me what thou art," says Campbell, as if the colours of the rainbow became less beautiful when we know scientifically how they arise, than if they had been provided by a mechanical miracle for the disembarcation of Noah. To the poet, certainily, the physical cause of the rainibow is less attractive than its possibility of being the symbol of a message of peace and promise. But such feelings are out of place when they intrude themselves, as they sometimes do, into the estimation of the truth of a scientific theory. The prejudice against the Darwinian theory implies that, if the higher organism be the product of the lower, the higher loses in worth and dignity, as if " man came fromn a beast " implied " therefore man is only a beast ". The prejudice against anthropological investigation of the origin of religious ideas and customs and of institutions such as marriage has a similar source-a prejudice to be found even amongst those who have themselves done notable service in the application of comparative and historical methods to the study of human society and ideas. It is supposed that religion loses its value if even its highest orms have 'an ancestry so low as fetish-worship, and that 5</page><page sequence="4">66 D. G. RITCHIEl: marriage loses its sanctity if " primitive marriage " turns out to be a euphemism for promiscuous sexual relations. Perhaps, however, there is an element of truth in the suspicion with which scientific analysis is regarded by most poets and by some philosophers. It is a true instinct which warns us, that we have not sufficiently disposed of a subject when we have given an historical account of how it came to be what it is: but this takes a false form, when it becomes a denial of the historical account. As against the 'meta- physical ' theories of Nature, Innate Ideas, Inexplicable Intuitions (which may happen to be only local or personal prejudices), the scientific methods of analysis and theories of evolution may be allowed complete validity, and it may yet be possible to deny that the real importance of ideas in logic, in ethics or in religion is affected, when it has been shown that they have a history in the minds of the race and of the individual. This history is important for our knowledge, and may alter many things in the way in which ideas have been accepted and institutions regarded; but, over and above this natural history, we have the task of philosophy-of metaphysics in the sense in which the world never can and never must dispense with it. This is, of course, a proposition which has been disputed. Either it may be denied that we need anything more than an explanation of how thilngs have come to be in order rightly to understand what they are, or it may be denied that we can discover any answer to the questions which we inevitably find ourselves asking after the sciences have spoken their last word. To the latter position (that of the Positivist) the objection is the same as that which may be made to all schemes of scepticism: How can you know the limitations of the mind, unless you who are limited are also in some way outside your limitation? It may be said: 'We find out our limitations only too surely by beating fruitlessly against the bars of our prisoh-house '. But why do we do so? Why have mankind always done so, if it is not from the instinct that a larger life is their natural one, in the sense of being their due ? 'Yes,' it may be said, 'but we learn wisdom withtime and shall give uptryingto avoid the inevitable.' But how, if in every step of advance made within the limits, there are already involved assumptions which imply that we in some way set our own limits? With the complete sceptic it is impossible to argue: he must be left to doubt his own scepticism, and so to contradict him- self. Assume the validity of the processes of scientific knowledge. Assume, as the mathematician does, the absolute certainty of his processes and of his results, so far</page><page sequence="5">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 67 as they conform to his processes. Assume, as the student of nature does, the relative certainity of his methods and results. How can we make these assumptions about the necessities of thought, about space, about the orderliness of the physical universe ? J. S. Mill boldly faced this objection to the satis- factoriness of psychological analysis: he denied the certainty of mathematics, and based the most trustworthy of inductive processes upon the least certain-the Inductio per sim?plicem enumerationem. But this mode of defence really leads to a complete scepticism or to a complete surrender of the problem to be solved. The lasting and permanent contri- bution of Kant to philosophy is his recognition of what the real problem of the theory of knowledge was, and what were the conditions of its solution. Assuredly there are different interpretations of Kant and different estimates of the relative importance of different parts of his systemr: but I consider that the point on which we must all always go " back to Kant," and on which we cannot go back behind him, if we are profitably to face the problems of philosophy now, is his conception of a " transcendental proof," and his view of the a priori element in all kniowledge. The Kantian recognition of an d priori element in knowledge has almost nothinag in common with psychological theories of intuitionism, which are only revivals or survivals of the old 'metaphysical' (in the bad sense) doctrines of innate ideas. The name a priori is unfortunate because it suggests a reference to time, which is irrelevant and misleading. Kant does not mean that the individual begins with certain mental forms and then goes oni to fill them ul with a content derived from experience. If that were the a prioii theory, as it is often s4pposed to be, it would be a theory very easy to refute, and a very absurd delusion to maintain. " The baby new to earth and sky " does not start with a knowledge of geometrical or other axioms. The psychologist has every right in saying that knowledge begins as sensation. That is true as a matter of mental history. He is only wrong, when he goes on to say that knowledge is nothing but sensation and the products of sensation, unless in the term ' products ' (or any equivalent term) he has tacitly implied the recognition of thought as what makes the development of knowledge out of sensation possible. Kant's individualist mode of treating the problem of knowledge certainly seems to countenance a psychological I interpretation. But so far as it does, that must be put aside 1 If the meaning of Psychology were so extended as to cover Kant's theory of knowledge, that would involve an inconvenient deviation from the general use of the word.</page><page sequence="6">68 D. G. RITOHIE: as the perishable part of Kant's theory. I may be interpret- ing wrongly; but I take the essence of the transcendental proof to be what I am going to state, and I cannot see that such a proof admits of any refutation, except from the con- sistent sceptic who, as said before, must be left to refute himself. It is not entirely a discovery of Kant's: Plato and Aristotle were at least on the verge of it; and the various systems of Metaphysical Idealism may all be considered as, amid many errors, feeling after it. If knowledcge be altogether dependent on sensation, knowledge is impossible. But knowledge is possible; because the sciences exist. Therefore, knowledge is not altogether dependent on sensation. It is no refutation of this argunment to say: 'Here is a history of the genesis of knowledge from sensation'. Because the argument is not a statement of a fact in psychology (psycho- genesis), but is entirely logical. The denial of it involves all our experience in contradiction. That is the ultimate argument, and, as we have said, will only be denied by the complete sceptic. W7iat this non-sensational element is must be discovered by taking the different stages and kinds of knowledge separately. And there is no reason why Kant should be right at every step here. The, details 6f the Kantian philo- sophy may come to have little more than an antiquarian interest. The simplest act of knowledge is the judgment. Judging involves comparison. Comparison requires that the different sensations should be held together in unity. (All this follows logically without any reference to psychology, though psychological experience may well come in as a test.) If I say 'It (i.e., anything what is presented to my senses) is warm,' I am asserting an identity along with difference, as existing for ine. One sensation could make no knowledge, nor one series of uniform sensations; nor a series of different sensations, unless they could be brought together for com- parison, and this bringing together cannot be actual, -bit must be ideal, i.e., a Self is implied in the simplest act of knowledge. If it is said, 'It is true that as we know now, a conscious self is implied in our knowledge, but that con- scious self is the result of a long process'-that may be accepted (or not) as a true statement of the history of mental development; but that does not do away with the logical force of the argument. It is not asserted that at an elementary stage human beings have any conception of self- consciousness nor any word for it, nor that they have reflected on it, bat only that the self-consciousness must be there potentially, implicitly. 'But what about the lower</page><page sequence="7">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 69 animals? If we cannot draw a hard and fast line between lower and higher, is not the recognition that man may be developed from lower animal forms fatal to the recognition of a non-sensational element is human knowledge?' To this it may be answered: (1) All inferences about the 'knowledge' possessed by the lower animals are rendered extremely uncertain, because we have no means whatever of communi- cating with them by language, and consequently interpret their actions on the analogy of externally similar actions dQne by ourselves. All tales about the cleverness of dogs, &amp;c., are full of unscientific anthropomorphism. It is well known how difficult it is fairly to interpret the ideas of lower human races, because of the imperfections of their language. When language is wanting, the difficulty becomes insuperable. (2) There seems no objection to admitting that, so far as lower animals possess anything that can be called know- ledge, i.e., so far as they can be imagined actually to make judgments, as in applying human analogies to them we always suppose them to do, so far they must have a con- sciousness of a self, though at some immeasurably lower and less explicit stage. If we say their life is one of mere sensa- tion, and yet ascribe to them a power of making judgments, their ' sensation ' must be a sort of 'obscure thinking'. Thus, when all has been said that can be said by physio- logy and psychology about the way in which thought arises out of sense, this, however true as a statement of historical facts, does not solve the problem of what knowledge is, unless it be regarded as a process in which Consciousness (thought) is coming to itself. What we find at the higher stage is no new element suddenly inserted alongside of other elements, nor is it a mere chemical product of elements different from it (chemical analogies lie at the base of many current psychological theories), but is what we are logically bound to regard as present throughout, though only fully realised and known at the higher stages. If it be said, that this is only importing a mystical metaphysics into what was already clear, then we must answer that without this mystical meta- physics the theory was not clear, because it could only be expressed by the use of a number of terms which had not been explained. It is sometimes thought that, by saying 'The lower is potentially the higher,' or 'contains the potency and promise of the higher,' all has been said that need be said. But what is meant by saying. 'A (e.g., the acorn) is potentially B (e.g., the oak)' ? If it merely means 'Here you have A, afterwards you will have B,' it would be better simply to say so; for then it would be made</page><page sequence="8">70 D. G. RITCHIE: obvious that no explanation of B has been given, and that neither A nor B is understood. 'A is potentially B,' if it means anything, must mean that in some way A already is B, and that B is needed to explain A. The late G-. HI. Lewes was not prejudiced in favour of old philosophies, but he most fully recognises the fact that we can only understand the lower from the point of view of the higher: " We can only understand the Amoeba and the Polype by a light reflected from the study of Man".' So that even within the sciences it is not really possible to 'begin at the beginning'. The attempt to do so will generally mean that some dimly accepted view about the " end" is influencing the observa- tions of the beginning; for, as Lewes reminds us, "our closest observation is interpretation". Even for the study of origins an examination of the end or most complete state as it exists is not superfluous, and such an examination, apart from historical methods, must be analytic, or, in Kant's phrase, critical. Before we proceed to ask what history tells us, it may be worth while to ask what history can tell us. By knowing what something was, we do not always know what it is, sometimes only what it (now) is not. To discover the a' priori element in knowledge, i.e., that element which, though known to us only in connexion with sense-experience, cannot be dependent upon sense-experience for its validity, is the business of a philosophical theory of knowledge. And if we call that a part of Metaphysics, it is a Metaphysics with which we cannot dispense. Suppose that ' Self-consciousness,' ' Identity,' ' Substance,' ' Cause,' 'Time,' ' Space,' be amongst the 'Categories' so discovered, to arrange these categories in a system, to see their relations to onae another and to the world of nature and of human action, will be the business of Philosophy or Metaphysics in a wider sense. ' Speculative Metaphysics,' as distinct from Critical, we might call it, because the method it must adopt can never have the logical precision and certainty of the Critical Method. The only test of the validity of a system of Speculative Metaphysics inust be its adequacy to the explanation and arrangement of the whole Universe as it becomes known to us. Thus this Metaphysics can never be complete, but must always be attempted anew by each thinker. The Critical examination of the nature of know- ledge may logically precede any or all of the special sciences, although it is only the advance of science that has suggested the need of such an examination; but the Metaphysician in this second sense can never be independent of any of the I Study of Psychology, p. 122.</page><page sequence="9">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 71 sciences or of any branch of human knowledge or effort. They are his material. To make knowledge possible there must (in Green's phrase) be " a comparing and distinguishing self"; but since Time, though relatively a form, is yet also one of the contents of knowledge, this self must in some way be independent of Time. I know I am a series of experiences in Time. Therefore, in some way, I am not in Time-but an Eternal (i.e., Time-less) Self-consciousness. But the Critical Philo- sophy can tell us nothing further, can tell us nothing as to what this Eternal Self-consciousness is or how it is related to our individual selves, which are the subject-matter' of Psychology. The attempt to find some expression for this relation, i.e., to show how an Eternal Self-consciousness reveals itself in Time and in Space is the business of Specu- lative Philosophy or Metaphysics. That there is an Eternal Self-consciousness we are logically compelled to believe, and that it is in some way present in our individual selves; but in what way is a matter of speculation: and it is still quite com- petent to any one who accepts the main result of the critical examination of knowledge to maintain that this latter problem is altogether insoluble; although it is a problem (or rather series of problems) which we cannot leave alone, because we are met by it at every step in our ordinary experience, if we only begin to reflect on the meaning and mutual relations of the conceptions we are obliged to use. It is not our present concern to give an exhaustive list of the a priori conceptions and principles which are involved in ordinary knowledge and in the procedure of scientific investi- gation and proof. An Intuitionist Philosophv, which pro- fesses to get at these principles by a simple introspection into the contents of consciousness, may fairly be met with the challenge to produce its list of intuitive principles. But if the term a priori be understood in the'way which has been explained above, no such challenge can be justly made. It is only as experience progresses that we can become fully aware of and can formulate the conceptions and principles which that experience logically involves. Only if knowledge were completed, could we know all that knowledge implied: and it is only as knowledge approximates to that apparently ever-receding goal that we can enlarge our view of what has been there implicitly from the first. Thus, in the very simplest acts of thought the principle of Identity and the principle of Contradiction (A is A; A is not not-A) are in- volved; and yet it was late in the history of mankind when the science of Logic was first enabled to discover and formu- late these principles. Nevertheless they are a priori in the</page><page sequence="10">72 D. G, RITCHIE: sense that without them all knowledge would be impossible. So it is with the axioms of the science of quantity. That " things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another " is implied in all the experience which Mill thought went to prove the principle. Every carpenter who uses a foot-rule, every barmaid who draws off half-a-pint implies the principle and acts on it, though totally ignorant of the elements of Geometry. Similarly, the rudest ideas about Nature imply the conception of a Cosmos, of an order of nature, though that order may include gods, demons, fairies, and goblins, of whom the modern scientific man takes no account, and may exclude gravitation, electricity, and other forces which he has come to recognise. The principle that every event has a cause, i.e., is related to some other event (or events) without which it would not happen and with which it must happen,-the two clauses of this definition of cause are sometimes mistakenly separated as the principles of Causation and Uniformity of Nature respectively,-is involved in the mental action of the savage who hears the thunder and looks round for an explanation, though he may be quite wrong in his explanation, and though it may be late in time before any human being comes to reflect on the processes of experience and to formulate its principles. But the history of how men came to recognise Uniformity of Nature and how their conceptions of Cause' and of Nature have varied is one thing: the logical character of the presupposition of all inductive inference is another. The former is a question of historical psychology; the latter of philosophical criticism. The proposition, " Every event must have a cause" is not a priori because it convinces every person the moment he understands it, but because no knowledge of natural events is possible without a connexion of them with other events as belonging to one system of nature. That nature is a system is the assumption underlying the earliest mythologies: to fill up this conception is the aim of the latest science. A capacity for discovering true causes may be capable of development as the race advances; so may be a capacity for philosophical analysis; but the presupposition of all in- vestigation of causes cannot itself be derived from the experience either of the individual or of the race. The question for the logician is not: 'How have I (or mankind generally) come to believe this?' That is a question for the psychologist and sociologist. The logical question is: 'Why am I or any one else justified in believing this ?' A confusion between these two questions underlies Mill's famous attack on the Syllogism. The essential and permanently significant portion of the Aristotelian doctrine</page><page sequence="11">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 73 of the Syllogism is the recognition that all inference (and cvXXorytapO*S just means ' inference') implies a Universal. As a psychological fact there may (though even this may be questioned) be in our minds a particular proposition and then immediately afterwards another particular proposition suggested by it. But, if the one can be described as an inference from the other, we must be able to answer the question why we get the one from the other. And the answer to the question mnust, if we formulate it, take the form of a universal proposition, of which, till we have to face the question, we may be perfectly unconscious, and will constitute the major premiss of the Aristotelian Syllogism (Barbara or Darii being taken as typical), the middle term being, in the scientific inference, the cause or ground (sufficient reason) of the conclusion. Thus the death of some one I know may suggest to me my own mortality; but the reason of the iniference is our common possessioin of the attributes of human and so of animal life. It is always with a question of validity that the logician as such has to deal;: ' Are we justified in inferring that? '-not with the psycho- logical process through which any particular person or persons have gone in arriving at their beliefs. Psychological introspection can, therefore, never solve logical difficulties. The formula of the Syllogism (major premiss, minor premiss, conclusion) is not an exposition of what actually takes place in any one's mind, but a logical exposition of that to which any actual inference must conform in order to be correet. It would not even be accurate to say it is the form according to which the normal reasoner actually reasons; because a man may reason quite correctly and be the inormal reasoner while quite unconscious of logical analysis. The reasonings of the normal reasoner are those which will conform best to the strict syllogistic form, when they are so analysed by the logician. The incorrectness of an apparent inference be- comes clear, when the reasoner is compelled to formulate the universal according to which he is reasoniing, though without beiiig aware of it. If he were fully aware of it, he could not commit fallacies. If we were fully aware of everything that every proposition implies, we could not assert false proposi- tions. Take another logical illustration, a minor matter. Mill says that proper names have no connotation. It may be true enough that the name 'John Smith ' suggests nothing to me or to you; but, if I am a philological ethnologist, it may suggest a good deal; if I have a friend of that name, it may suggest a good deal more. These are matters of psycholo- gical interest, and no definite answer independent of time,</page><page sequence="12">74 D. G. RITCHIE: place, circumstances and persons can be given. But the name of an individual, not as a mere word, but as the name of an individual, must logically have an infinite connotation. That we can say quite definitely, and that is the reason why the proper name cannot be defined. Any given person may be unable to say anything about any given proper name; whether he can or not is a matter of fact. But logic has to do with the ideal possibilities of definition. And we can answer quite certainly: We never can exhaust the significa- tion of the individual. The controversy whether mathematical judgments are analytic or synthetic is of a similar kind. As a psycholo- gical question it is a matter of degree, and, in the case of arithmetic, will depend solely on the extent to which a person has learned the multiplication- table, &amp;c. This is one of the merely psychological distinctions that intrude themselves into Kant's theory of knowledge. Whether any proposition conveys any new information to a person is always a ques- tion which cannot be answered irrespective of time, place, &amp;c. In one sense nothing we ever can learn is new, else we could not learn it: it would be quite irrelevant to our already existing knowledge. (This is the truth in the old Sophistic paradox.) In this way all reasoning is reasoning in a circle; but it is a circle so large-as large as the Universe-that we need be under no immediate fear of completing it. To omniscience all propositions must be analytic (identical). That is the ideal of knowledge, and it is the standard by which all statements and all professed inferences are ultimately judged. This amounts to saying, in other words, that the inconceivability of the opposite is the ultimate test of all truth. Only it is a test that we cannot safely apply in practice, except where we can be per- fectly sure that we have eliminated all risks of ambiguity and have fully realised all the conditions under which we are making an assertion. Thus we can only safely apply it in very abstract sciences, such as geometry. We know exactly what we mean and what others will understand by a " straight line," and by " enclosing a space "; and there- fore we can quite certainly say " Two straight lines cannot enclose a space"; because to suppose that they do involves us in contradiction, and would make us assert that the straight line was also not a straight line. But, if any one at the beginning of this century had said 'It is inconceivable that a message should be sent from London to New York in a few minutes,' his statement would only be correct if he were to insert the qualification: 'the modes of transmitting, messages being such as I know of'; for then it would be</page><page sequence="13">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 75 true that we could not really thinik of the carrier pigeon, being what we know it to be, traversing space with such velocity. Logic, then, is concerned not with what actually goes on in the mind of any individual or of the average individual. That is the business of psychology. Logic is concerned with the rules or ideal standards to which the mental processes of every one must conform if they are to attain truth. Parallel with logic there are at least two other Regulative Philosophical sciences (branches of philosophy)-concerned respectively with those rules or ideals which must be ful- filled for the attainment of Beauty in Art, and with those which must be 'fulfilled for the realisation of Goodness in conduct. The presupposition of knowledge was found to be the presence of a Self which is Eternal and which yet is never completely realised in any one of us, and which thus remains as an Ideal (Sollern) perpetually urging to its realisa- tion. If we approach the study of mankind from the side of Nature, we find everywhere a "groaning and travailing," not, as has been too readily supposed, a universal pursuit of pleasure, but a universal struggle and a seemingly hopeless' struggle to escape pain, whether the pain of physical, emotional or intellectual suffering. A dispassionate view of the process of evolution seems to leave no escape from a philosophy of despair; for, as the struggle for existence eliminates some physical evils, it intensifies the acuteness of emotional and intellectual desires, and increases the ever- recurring pain that comes from the perpetual incapacity of satisfying a want and a craving which grow with every satisfaction. But, if the necessity of endeavouring to explain how knowledge is possible compels us to, recognise an Eternal Self ever demanding realisation, may we not, look- ing back now from the standpoint of the Ideal, regard all the blind struggle of Nature as the lower and unconscious phases of this process of the realisation of the Eternal Self? This identification would be a hypothesis of Speculative Philosophy, and could not have the certainty of the mere recognition of an Eternal Self; but it is the theory which seems best to explain all the phenomena, and it does not con- flict with any scientific fact, although undoubtedly incapable of scientific verification. From the side of origins the struggle seems vaini, and yet we can only pronounce it vain, because we have in us an ideal standard by which we judge. We can only know that the crooked is crooked if we have an ideal of the straight; we can only know that the world is evil, if we have in us an ideal of absolute good. We know our ignorance, because we have an ideal of perfect know-</page><page sequence="14">76 D. G. 1RITCHIE: ledge; we know the ugliness and discord of the world, because we have an ideal of perfect beauty and harmony; we know its wickedness, because we have an ideal of a per- fected society; we are conscious of sin, because we know *that our true self is God, from whom we are severed. How these various ideals grow up in the minds of mankind, and how their content varies at different periods, is matter for the psychologist and the historian. But why there are such ideals at all can oinly be explained if we start from the side of Philosophical Analysis. ?sthetics might, on grounds of etymology, be considered most properly to be concerned with the question, how we (whoever the 'we' may be) have come to judge this or that to be beautiful-which is a question of psy- chology. But we want some name for the philosophical science which attempts to solve the question, why this or that is beautiful; or rather, to put the question in a form that seems better to avoid the assumptions of the old ontological metaphysics which we have discarded, why this or that otght to be considered beautiful. For it will not do to say: 'That is beautiful which is generally considered beautiful,' since, least of all in matters of artistic taste, is the person of taste ready to accept the opinion of any chance persons. If we say, ' That ought to be con- sidered beautiful which is considered beautiful by the person of taste,' we have only transferred the ideal to the person, because then we mean that he is the person- whose judg- inent ought to be accepted. He says 'I now consider this beautiful, and, if I am right, people will gradually come to acknowledge it,' i.e., he gives out his judgment as his own, and yet not as a judgment of a mere subjective liking, but as one that has a claim to have an objective validity to be valid for all, if they could only come to see as he sees. I am assuming the person of taste to be a healthy-minded critic who expects and wishes his judgments to be accepted and does not pride himself on having a peculiar taste, which no one except himself and his own small set will ever share; others may not share it as yet, but unless he expects others to share it, his judgment only claims a subjective validity, i.e., it means only 'This pleases me,' not ' This is beauti- ful'. Neither in explaining the work of the artist nor in explaining the judgment of the lover of art can we leave out the conception of an ideal-an ought to be. All the attempts to reduce this to a statement of 'what is' bring in the conception in some concealed form. Similarly in Ethics. If the moral law be expressed.as "that which the good man does " (as by Mr. Leslie Stephen),</page><page sequence="15">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 77 then in "good man" we have brought in the conception of ought which has been eliminated from "law". How we (the race or the individual) have come to think this or that right is a matter for sociology and psychology-it would be the history of moral ideas and the psychology of the moral senti- ments; but these do not explain why there should be any thinking right or wrong at all. The old Intuitional Ethics as- sumes certain absolute principles of right and wrong, and thus comes into direct conflict with scientific investigations into the origin of moral ideas. The theory of Idealism for which we are contending only maintains that all accounts of the. evolution of morality are inadequate to supply a complete theory of Ethics, unless the presence of an ideal to all human effort be recognised as involved in the presence of the Eternal Self which any account of knowledge or conduct presupposes. What the ideal at any time may be, i.e., the content of the ideal, is a matter for historical investigation. The ideal must vary, else progress would be impossible. But there must be an ideal, a judgment of "ought," else morality would be impossible. The same thing becomes clear when we pass to Politics. Intuitions as to natural rights only prove delusive. We can- not settle in that way what the state ought to do and what not. As already said, ' natural rights' is a misleading phrase if supposed to refer to some original rights of man; practically it can only mean 'What man ought to have'. So, too, it is unhistorical and, what is worse, illogical to say that society originated in a contract; for contract presup- poses society. But there may be a very good sense in saying that society ought to be " contractual" (M?. Fouillee's phrase), i.e., that members of a good state ought to feel that the laws which they obey are not the commands of an alien force but are self-imposed, so that obedience to them becomes the highest realisation of freedom. Theories which treat the state as analogous to a natural organism err in an opposite way from those which regard it as resulting from a contract. Theories of contract state a question of value as if it were a question of origin. Theories which apply the conceptions of organism and evolution to society as if they were as adequate in politics as in biology, while they may give a correct account of the origins of society, leave us with- out a criterion by which to judge of the goodness or badness of any social condition. The only logically available criterion would be the ultimate success of any given society in the struggle for existence. In practical politics we cannot wait for that: we are safer with the Utilitarian method. But why? Just because it brings in a standard of worth, though</page><page sequence="16">78 D. G. RITCHIE: too narrowly conceived. It estimates goodness by the end to which a society tends, i.e., by reference to an ideal. We have heard much lately of the historical method in politics-so much that it is time to hear something on the other side. The historical method has done for the study of human society great services in ridding us of the 'metaphy- sical' fictions of a Law of Nature, State of Nature, Original Contract, Natural Rights, &amp;c.; but those who are strongly possessed by the historical spirit are sometimes disposed to think that, when they have shown how an institution came into being, they have said all that is worth saying on the matter. It is a mistake to suppose that, because an institu- tion now serves certain purposes, it was created for these purposes; but, when we know how an institution came into being, we have still, as practical persons, to ask our- selves: ' What purposes does it now serve? '-else we do not estimate it rightly. Because the House of Lords was inot invented as a check on legislation, it does not follow that the House of Lords is not a check on legislation-for good or for evil. Because the English State never at any moment in history selected a certain religious body and gave it certain endowments and privileges, it does not follow that the phrases ' State Church,' 'Established Church' are altogether meaningless as representing the present relation of the Church to the State. And it is this present relation and not historical facts about the Church in the time of the Ileptarchy or the Power of Convocation in the time of Henry VIII. which the practical politician has to take into account. He is concerned with value, not with origins. Again, when it is asked by what right an individual owns half a county, history may lead us back to the dissolution of the monasteries, the Norman conquest, the Saxon invasion, and so on, till we come to the first blue-painted barbarian who stuck a rude spade into the ground, half cleared from brushwood. But all this, however interesting, is irrelevant to the question whether the present system of land tenure can be justified or not. Existing rights may be explained by reference to the past, but can only be justified, if it is shown that they subserve social wellbeing now and are likely to do so in the future. Similarly with the whole question of endowments. 'What was' must not blind us to 'what ought to be,' though of course the inconvenience of disturb- ing customs and expectations, where that is unnecessary, has always to be taken into account. The practical reformer will move, as far as possible, in the line of least resistance. It is a pity when a scientific theory or the spirit of anti- quarianism interferes with the removal of mischievous</page><page sequence="17">ORIGIN AND VALIDITY. 79 abuses. But they are apt to do so, unless the philosopher is at hand to criticise the conceptions which are being used. Lastly, let us consider the application of this distinction between questions of origin and of validity in the domain of Religion. . This is an application which we cannot avoid, however much we might hesitate about trespassing upon a domain that is guarded so jealously by those professionally interested. The theory of knowledge obliges us to assume the existence of an Eternal Self-consciousness partially revealed in ourselves. This, which is the Ideal of Knowledge, of Beauty, of Goodness, is the God of Religion. It is not asserted that there is an intuitive knowledge of the existence of one God. Such an assertion is difficult to maintain in the face of what we know of the history of religions. The idea of God, as held by the religious thinkers of the highest types of religion, is of slow and late growth. The identification of a power (or powers) outside us with our highest ideals of know- ledge, of beauty, and of goodness is not dreamt of by the primitive savage, just because he has not our ideals. Nor can the idea be completed till these ideals are completed, i.e., the growth of the idea of God, which we may call the revela- tion of God, is continuous and is commensurate with human progress. The criticism of science must be allowed full weight as against the belief that religious truth was conveyed by some inexplicable means to certain individuals at a definite time, and then handed down like some treasure of silver or gold. The prejudice against Biblical Criticism and the scientific study of Religions implies that the value of a religious idea is altogether derived from the channel through which it was first conveyed to mankind-a Prophet, a Sacred Book, an infallible Church. But the value of a religious idea cannot be dependent upon an external authority of any kind, but solely on its own adequacy to express, in a manner fitted to appeal at once to the intellect and the emotions, the highest possible beliefs of the time. This is implicitly recog- nised by Christian apologists, when they appeal to the supreme excellence of Christian morality; but what is the value of such an appeal if the morality is itself dependent for its validity upon the authority of miraculous persons or writings? So far as Christianity is a system of spiritual doctrines and beliefs about the relation between the soul of the individual and the Divine Spirit which is ever operating in the Universe, it finds a philosophical counterpart and intellectual interpretation in Idealism; but, so far as it is represented as necessarily including cextain statements about alleged matters of fact, Idealism can lend no support to the apologist in his controversy with historical critics.</page></plain_text>
