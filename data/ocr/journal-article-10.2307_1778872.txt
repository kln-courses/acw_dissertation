A notice of the Italian edition of these fine volumes has already appeared in this Journal (vol. 39, p. 598), but the publication of the English edition presents an opportunity for further mention of some of the more technical points discussed by the author. For besides being a most readable account of a memorable expedition, Dr. de Filippi's book is a serious geographical work. Almost every chapter raises interesting "points in physical geography, and discusses them in such a manner that the most ordinary reader has no difficulty in following the argument. Particularly interesting is the discussion of the past history of the Indus valley. The author appears sceptical as to the capacity of the lacustrine theory to account for the deposits actually found and to which he is inclined to attribute a fluvial origin during some f ormer moister period. The strange fact which has puzzled previous observers that the Baltoro and others of the longest glaciers in this region present no f rontal moraine, is ascribed by the author to the immobility of the terminai portion, which has in fact become a mass of mere stagnant ice. Though slight degrees of advance or recession have been noted, yet in comparison with their great length the lower ends of these glaciers have remained relatively stationary for many years. Awakened activity on the part of the glacier might result in a flow of ice over the older stagnant portion and there is indeed an indication that this has actually occurred in the illustration on p. 183, and on the beautiful plate facing p. 186; or if the pressure were sufficient the underlying mass might be revivified. This theory is a plausible one, and the present writer has observed what would appear to be a further stage in this process in south-west Tibet, where masses of dead ice deeply covered with moraine extended about a third of a mile below and completely severed from the living ice of the Gurla glacier. The author objecta to Dr. Workman's habit of classifying as " nieves penitentes" diverse ice- formations " which have neither origin, production, nor composition in common." With reference to the longitudinal ice-ridges chaotically broken across but not crevassed, which are found on the Baltoro and other glaciers, he is convinced that uneven melting due to varying thickness of the moraine layer is the main factor, though he does not altogether discard the theory of lateral pressure advanced by Sir Martin Oonway and Dr. Workman. The singular fact that the most careful barometric readings consistently gave a lower value than trigonometrical observations gives occasion for a most suggestive reference to variations in gravity. With regard to anthropology, the author agrees with Ujfalvy, against prac- tically all the other authorities, in ascribing to the Baltis an Aryan as against a Mongol origin. Though there were no opportunities for strict anthropomorphic investigations, many of Mr. Sella's illustrations appear to bear this out, as does a Balti skull obtained in the Saltoro region and now in the museum at Oxford. For the Balti coolies the author has nothing but praise, and indeed the testimony in their favour is all but unanimous amongst mountaineers, who should be the first to admit that such successes as they have gained in these inhospitabls regions would have been impossible without their services. Fortunate indeed</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS. 157 are subsequent visitors when their predecessors have left behind them such a good record for fair dealing as in the case of the members of this expedition. H.R.H. the Duke of the Abruzzi undertook this expedition chiefly to contribute to the solution of the vexed problem as to the greatest height which may be reached by mountaineers. In this he attained a remarkable degree of success. He and his guides lived for thirty-seven days at or above 16,000 feet, and then for another seventeen were never below 18,000 feet, of which nine were spent at or above 21,000 feet. K2 proved unassailable, but two high ascents, both marred by bad weather, were made onBride peak. On the last attempt, starting at 5.30 a.m. from their camp at 22,483 feet, the highest camp yet made, they reached a height of 24,600 feet at 1 p.m., having been delayed by bad snow conditions and a laborious climb up a rib of rock which cost considerably more time to accomplish at such an altitude than a similar stretch of snow. Here they waited in vain for two hours, hoping that the mists would clear away and show them a safe route along the dangerous snow cornices on either hand, where it would have been madness to venture under such conditions. Thus it was that under adverse circumstances the Duke carried the " man-level" 700 feet higher than any previous mountaineer. It was not the low atmospheric pressure of 12^ inches which stopped them. If those last two hours had been clear there is hardly a doubt that the Duke would have attained the actual summit of Bride peak, 25,110 feet. In spite of almost continuous bad weather at his highest camps and a consequent degree of hardship which it must be admitted few constitutions would be capable of resisting, the Duke and his guides seemed to have been little the worse for their exertions except for marked loss of appetite and weight. They siept without difficulty. They did not suffer from mountain sickness. It is obvious that the limit has not yet been reached. But the prize is for the very few in any generation. With regard to the very numerous illustrations and the large panoramas, Mr. Sella's name alone is a sufncient guarantee of excellence, They combine with the letterpress to give an extraordinarily vivid description of a marvellous region. The translation has been well done in spite of the lamentable blow of fate which prevented the same hand from finishing the whole task. The appen- dices are of great interest, especially that on the Photogrammetric Survey by the Marquis Negrotto, and on the geological results by Messrs. Novarese and- Oldham. A feature of the book, only too rare nowadays, although it never fails to enhance any narrative of travel, is the careful manner in which the author has read, digested, and given references to the work of former travellers in this region. In addition to writing a most interesting account of a memor- able expedition, Dr. de Filippi has given us the best book of ref erence extant on this region. T. G. L.</page></plain_text>
