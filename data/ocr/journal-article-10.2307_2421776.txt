<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Loci of Contact Chemoreceptors in Insects A Review With New Evidence' Hubert Frings and Mable Frings Pennsylvania State College, State College, Pennsylvania INTRODUCTION Biologists have long known that many insects possess a contact chemical sense which enables them to distinguish edible materials from non-edible. Only recently, however, have attempts been made to discover experimentally the location and nature of the receptors involved. It is obvious that this knowledge is important for those engaged in the physiological study of the senses of insects and the mechanism of food selection by insects. Hayes and Liu (1947) further emphasize the possible importance of a knowledge of the location of chemoreceptors in understanding the action of insecticides, such as DDT. Accordingly, a study on the location of the contact chemoreceptors of insects from nine orders was undertaken to add to our meagre knowledge in this field. Further, a review of the literature to date seemed appropriate at this time, since the experimental results of the past few years and the results of this study make much of the older work of historical interest only. A description of the results of this work and a summary of our knowledge to date are here presented. HISTORICAL REVIEW From the earliest times men have noted that many insects select their food carefully, and this has led naturally to the conclusion that they possess a sense of taste. Lehmann (1798) refers to Aristotle's statement of this fact. The earliest conjectures as to the location of the taste-organs were based on the belief that these organs must be in or near the mouth. Thus, Lehmann (1800) noted that a biologist, whom he does not identify, had stated that the antennae might be for taste, and this Lehmann considers too ridiculous to consider seriously. Lesser (1742) stated that the palpi were probably the seat of this sense in insects, though he offered no proof. Later, Treviranus (1816) and Dufour (1826) restated this belief.2 Kirby and Spence (1828), 1 We are happy to express our appreciation to the following persons: Mrs. Bonnie R. O'Neal, who assisted with some of the experiments, Mr. C. L. Hamrum, who aided in many phases of the work, Prof. E. J. Anderson, who kindly furnished the honey bees used in the experiments, and Mr. R. S. Beese, who took the photomicrographs. The expenses incurred in the photographic work were met by a grant from the John Vogel Memorial Fund of the Pennsylvania Pest Control Operators' Association. 2 According to Kirby and Spence (1828) and Plateau (1885), Lehmann (1798) credited Knoch with the statement that the labial palpi of insects are for taste and the maxillary palpi for smell. Many later workers copied this, some citing one of Lehmann's other two papers (1799, 1800) as the references. In the first of Lehmann's papers (1798), he discusses both taste and smell in insects, but without mEntioning any work by Knoch; in the second (1799), he did not discuss the palpi at all; and in the last (1800), he dis- cuLssed only the possibility that the antennae may be for taste. We have not been able to find anywhere in these three papers reference to any work by a Knoch or to the idea mentioned by Kirby and Spence and Plateau. 602</page><page sequence="2">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 603 however, considered the palpi as organs of touch and the "tongue," being like the tongue of vertebrates, as the seat of taste in insects. Newport (1836) concurred in this, pointing out that the palpi are unsuited for taste because of their hard covering. He did, however, note that papilae on the proboscis of the butterfly, Vanessa atalanta, might be for taste. In the years, 1860-1885, some morphological studies with a few crude experiments were reported, culminating finally in the work of Will (1885). Packard (1878) for the Rocky Mountain locust, maintained that the tips of the palpi might bear taste-organs, basing this opinion purely on anatomical considerations. Graber (1877), however, believed that one should look only in the mouth of insects for taste-organs, though he admitted that the hypo- pharynx might serve. For the Lepidoptera, Muller (1877) described a group of organs at the tip of the proboscis of a butterfly which he called "Schmeckstifte." Chatin (1880), likewise, regarded the small hairs along the proboscis as possibly gustatory. Breitenbach (1882), however, disputed the statement of Muller, believing that the organ at the tip of the proboscis of the butterfly is a boring organ. He cited Graber's statement that the taste-organs of insects must be in the mouth cavity. Kirbach (1883) then described a group of papillae on a chitinous plate in the upper pharynx and called these the taste-organs. There was no experimental evidence for any of these statements. For the Diptera, Lowne (1870) stated that, in the blow fly, Calliphora vomitoria, organs on the palpi, and papillae found on the labella between the pseudotracheae (interpseudotracheal papillae) are the taste-organs. This statement was based solely on the fact that the position of these seemed appropriate. Meinert (1881, 1882) accepted, with some question, the inter- pseudotracheal papillae as taste-organs, but believed also that hairs and papil- lae on the labrum, epipharynx and ligula of some Diptera (Asilus, Tipula, Rh,'ngia) were possibly important. Becher (1882) likewise cautiously stated that the labral hairs of Tabanus, Syrphidae, etc. might be for taste. Contrast- ing with these cautious statements, Kiinkel and Gazagnaire (1881) claimed unequivocally, on purely morphological grounds, that short hairs on the epi- pharynx, hypopharynx, and pharynx of Diptera are the receptors, though they credited the labellar organs in an off-hand way. Kraepelin (1882, 1883), however, disagreed with Meinert and Kiinkel and Gazagnaire and stated with no more proof than they, that the hairs of the labella are tactile and the inter- pseudotracheal papillae are gustatory. For ants, Meinert (1860) described organs on the maxillae and at the base of the tongue which he thought might be for taste, though he cautiously added a question-mark. Forel (1874, 1884), after showing that ants refuse honey to which strychnine and morphine are added, concluded, without further evidence, that the organs described by Meinert, and found by Forel at the same loci and also at the tip of the tongue, are the taste-organs. For bees, Wolff (1875) believed that the taste-organs are in the groove of, and at the base of the tongue, and in the pharynx. He further described a</page><page sequence="3">604 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) group of cup-like organs at the base of the tongue which he thought were olfac- tory, likening the proboscis to the nose of vertebrates. Later workers, how- ever, discarding his crude anthropomorphism, selected these as the gustatory organs. Forel (1878) showed the error of Wolff's belief that the organs at the base of the tongue are olfactory by experiments on wasps demonstrating that the antennae are probably the loci of the olfactory organs. Later, Forel (1884) declared that the organs of Wolff in the bee are like those described by Meinert and himself in ants. Graber (1877), likewise, regarded the Wolf- fian organs as probably taste-organs, since they are in the mouth. Kraepelin (1882), on the other hand, returned to the tip of the tongue and described tlhe "Borsten" at that point as taste-organs. He backed this up by claiming that these are open at the end, thus obviating the difficulty suggested by New- port that chitinous organs would be impermeable. Briant (1884), however, regarded the hairs on the tongue of the honey bee as tactile. He reported an experiment to back this up. Touching the tip of the proboscis of an anaesthe- tized bee with honey elicited no lowering of the proboscis. Touching the antennae, however, elicited an immediate response. He, therefore, concluded that the probocis probably bears no gustatory receptors. In 1880, Chatin published a review in which he attempted to summarize previous work and derive some generalizations. He stated that the palpi and antennae probably do not bear taste-organs, but are for touch. He believed that the walls of the pharynx and the buccal cavity would have taste-organs, though the hypopharynx and various parts of the proboscis of Lepidoptera (hairs along the proboscis), Diptera (labella), and Hymenoptera ("tongue") might bear receptors as well. The Hemiptera, Anoplura and Siphonaptera he regarded as being without a sense of taste. In 1877, Joseph claimed to have found sense-organs on the mouth-parts of forms from "almost all orders of insects" which he regarded as taste-organs. He also claimed to have observed color changes in protoplasm in little vesicles at the bases of these when sapid substances were brought to them. Unfor- tunately, Joseph did not state clearly the species of insects used in these exper- iments nor did he give a description of his techniques. Will (1885), therefore, questioned this work. Other workers also challenged Joseph to give full details, but he did not publish further. Thus, while this is the first description of an experimental attempt to discover the actual end-organs for contact chemoreception, there is too much uncertainty in the report for the work to be fully accepted. Will (1885) is usually credited with starting the modem experimental approach to the study of contact chemoreception in insects. It is only fair, however, to note that the work of Joseph (1877), if his work be accepted, Forel (1874), and Briant (1884) antedated his work. Further, except for some incomplete tests with removal of palpi and unsuccessful attempts to local- ize the end-organs under a microscope, Will merely showed that wasps, bees, ants, and flies could distinguish acceptable materials from unacceptable on the basis of taste. It is interesting to note that, almost 100 years before, Lehmann</page><page sequence="4">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 605 (1798) had likewise found that a fly would not feed on sugar which had been soaked in bitter medicine. Will's work on the location of the end-organs, using histological techniques and assumed criteria of structure and position for taste-receptors, is no more critical than that of his predecessors. He believed that contact chemoreceptors must have the nerve-ends exposed to direct contact with sapid solutions and that the receptors must be bathed in saliva or some similar fluid. These cri- teria obviously eliminated the paipi and antennae as possible loci. But neither of these criteria is valid. First, so far as we know, there are no openings through the exoskeleton of the insect (Snodgrass, 1935), and thus all chemi- cals must penetrate (if penetration is necessary for stimulation) at least a thin exoskeletal layer to reach the nerve endings. Second, the discovery of tarsal chemoreceptors in insects (Minnich, 1921) showed that these receptors need not be bathed in saliva, if the sapid substances are already in solution. Will's "Geschmacksbecher" at the base of the tongue and the under side of the maxil- lae and his "Geschmackborsten" on the tip of the tongue in Hymenoptera are no more necessarily taste-organs than the supposed receptors described by other insect anatomists. While Will described the distribution and appear- ance of these organs only in the Hymenoptera, he wrote that he had found them in all orders of insects in similar places. The importance of Will's work lies in its summarizing, at least in part, the literature to that time and in indi- cating, even though crudely, the necessity for an experimental approach. Breithaupt (1886), like Will, described pits at the base of the tongue and in the pharynx of the bees, Bombus and Apis, which he claimed to be the organs of taste. To show that the bee did not taste with the tip of the probos- cis, he anaesthetized some bees and touched the tip of the proboscis with honey or sugar-water getting no response. When he touched the antennae, how- ever, an immediate extension of the mouth-parts occurred. He concluded from this that taste-organs were lacking on the proboscis, and that taste and smell are not clearly separable in insects. It is interesting to note that both Breithaupt and Briant (1884) discovered the antennal contact chemoreceptors of the bee some time before their real recognition (Minnich, 1932). Only Briant seems to have realized, however, that these are organs, of taste.3 Leydig (1886) disagreed with Will and Breithaupt with reference to the 3 Forel does not seem to have believed that insects actually taste with the antennae, as Minnich (1932) so credited him. The error lies in the translation of Forel's review (1900) into English (1908). The translation, as correctly quoted by Minnich, reads (p. 96): "But in other insects they (the antennae) are mobile and serve them at once to smell at a distance and taste what they can touch" (parentheses ours). Forel's words, however, are "Mais chez d'autres insectes elles sont mobiles et leur servent a la fois 'a flairer de loin et a tater ce qu'il; peuvent atteindre." Since nowhere else does Forel use the verb, "tater," to mean taste, and in two other places at least speaks of "odorat au con- tact" in connection with the antennae, it seems certain that he did not believe that insects actually taste with these appendages. This is further supported by the statement of Lub- bock (1888, p. 39) that no one "has suggested that the antennae are organs of sight or taste." Forel's (1886) review, which was simply republished without change in 1900 and translated in 1908, is cited in Lubbock's bibliography and thus had been read by him.</page><page sequence="5">606 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) structure of the taste-organs. He believed that the hair-organs, "Tastborsten," acted for both touch and taste, depending on position, and claimed to have shown previously (1859) that the hairs on the tongue of the bee are the taste- organs, chiding Will for not finding his previous work. Vom Rath (1887, 1888), on the other hand, agreed with Will on Hymen- optera and with Kraepelin on Diptera, coining the term, "Geschmackskegel," fol the organs they had described. He believed that these are the same mor- phologically on the antennae, palpi, labium, maxillae, epipharynx and hypo- pharynx. He further stated that those on the antennae and palpi are for smiell, and those on the other regions of the mouth-parts are for taste, admit- ting freely that he had no experimental data for this belief. Lowne (1890), in a later edition of his book on the blow fly, also accepted Will's work, and redescribed the hairs on the palpi, which he had previously stated were gustatory (1870), and on the labella to meet the new criteria. Thus, he found these hairs grooved on the side. He discarded the inter- pseudotracheal papillae as chemoreceptors, believing that they are the openings of glands. Gazagnaire (1886a and b), also using the criteria laid down by Will, declared that the end-organs in the Dytiscidae (diving beetles) and certain other families of water-beetles are on the posterior surface of the labrum. He performed no experiments to support this. Packard (1889a and b, 1898), likewise, "located" the taste-organ of mandibulate insects on the labrum- epipharynx without experimental support. He coined the word, "taste-cups," for the supposed end-organs and studied their distribution in insects from many orders. At this time, the palpi of the insects reached a new low in the estimation of biologists. Plateau (1885, 1887) studied the feeding behavior of earwigs, roaches, grasshoppers and beetles and declared that, since the insects could feed normally after removal of the palpi, the palpi are useless. According to him, they are merely degenerate cephalic legs, and the insects could get along without them very well. These findings, of course, further strengthened the belief that the taste-organs of insects must be in the mouth, as Will had stated. Wassmann (1889), however, came to tlhe defense of the palpi with a criticism of Plateau's work. He pointed out that proper controls were lacking in the experiments, and he performed some experiments in which he found that the feeding of insects from which he removed the palpi was severely affected. It does not follow, anyway, he pointed out, that the palpi are useless merely because an insect can manage without them. Wassmann believed that the palpi function at least for moving the food to the mouth-parts and probably for touch and taste, since they are well furnished with sense-organs. Forel (1886, 1900, 1901, 1908),4 Lubbock (1888), and Jourdan (1889), 4 Forel's review on taste was written and first published in 1886. It was republished in 1900 and translated into English in 1908. This review, however, contains no references to work after 1886.</page><page sequence="6">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 607 in their reviews of the subject, summarized the work. They noted the many gaps and the great amount of controversy in the field, but generally agreed that the taste-organs of insects must be looked for in or near the mouth (phar- ynx, epipharynx, "palate," maxillae, etc.) and not on the palpi. The end- organs, they thought, are probably modified hairs, or the cups described by \X7oLff and Will, or both. All agreed, however, that the situation left much to be desired. By far the most important contribution to the field of location of contact chemoreceptors in insects during the nineteenth century was that of Nagel (1892, 1894). He reviewed the previous literature in the field, and, on the basis of that and his own experiments, he propounded some generalizations which still have pertinence. He believed that the olfactory and gustatory organs are closely similar in function and structure, and indeed that one might function for the other. He stated that it was not necessary to have the exo- skeleton perforated for stimulation, thus stating a generalization which has olily recently become generally accepted. He further classified the organs of taste into inner and outer types, the inner organs inside the mouth and outer elsewhere. He believed that inner taste-organs are present in all insects, being the only ones present in mandibulate insects. Outer taste-organs, how- ever, he stated, are found in sucking insects, and in aquatic forms, taking the place of the sense of smell. The most constant position for the inner taste- organs, Nagel wrote, was the mouth and "Gaurtien," the "Kegel" or "Zapf- chen" of these regions being the end-organs. The outer taste-organs, he wrote, are usually at the bases of the palpi, tip of the hypopharynx and tip of the labium. Nagel performed physiological experiments on Dystiscus larvae and adults, offering them balls of absorbent material soaked in food and food to which quinine and the like were added. The reactions of the beetles were noted before and after removal of the antennae, palpi, labrum, and other parts. From these experiments he concluded that the taste-organs of the adult Dytiscus are on the "Gaumenplatte" and at the bases of the labial and maxillary palpi. He believed that the larvae, however, have taste-organs on the tips of the palpi, and no inner organs. Unfortunately, all his operations were gross removals of parts, and his decisions as to the end-organs on the parts he found to bear chemoreceptors were dictated by the preconceived notion that the receptors were the type of end-organ he selected before the experiments. Nagel performed similar, though far less thorough, experiments on other beetles and concluded that the situation was like that in Dytiscus. For other mandibulate insects he believed that the taste-organs are in the mouth, as in beetles, though he admitted he could find no inner taste-organs in some of these (Periplaneta americana, for example). For the Hymenoptera, he accepted the work of Will and Forel, redescribing their organs as "Gesch- mrackskegel" or "Gesmackszapfchen" and showing that these were not per- forated, as Will had assumed. For the Diptera, he accepted Kraepelin's work, describing the interpseudotracheal papillae as "Geschmackskegel," and, in this</page><page sequence="7">608 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) order, he found no inner receptors at all. He noted that blow flies with the antennae removed would drop the proboscis when walking over droplets of honey as soon as the feet touched the liquid. He failed to interpret this observation of tarsal chemoreception correctly, however, stating that the fly probably smells with the proboscis. For the Lepidoptera, he found no inner organs present, and noted that the "Zapfchen" on the surface of the proboscis are probably for touch, but could be for taste, possibly being dual purpose receptors. Later (1897), after reading Kirbach's paper (1883) on butterflies, he reexamined the ventral wall of the pharynx and found there the rudimen- tary inner taste-organ which, from his hypothesis, he had postulated would exist. The work of Nagel is a combination of astute experimentation and good anatomical work. Unfortunately, his experiments were often carried just short of that necessary for the attainment of his goal, and he occasionally inter- preted his results to suit preconceived ideas. He did admit, though, that his experiments did not prove unequivocally the gustatory function of his sup- posed receptors. His experiments, however, showed more than just the fact that insects can select their food by means of a chemical sense. He further showed the futility of attempting broad generalizations from studies on one species, stating clearly that many of the arguments of earlier workers were due to their using different species, often even from different orders, without regard for the differences one should expect among animals with such widely varied food-habits as insects have. In spite of the fact that Nagel's work clearly showed the value of the experimental approach, some workers still continued to describe parts as gus- tatory without experimental evidence. Thus Wesche (1904) stated that the taste-organs of Vespa, Blatta, Apis, and Panorpa are blunt hairs or pegs, in pits or on bases, on the mouth-parts. He believed that the interpseudo- tracheal papillae of Diptera are actually modified taste-hairs, and that the palpi of Diptera are for touch, smell, and taste. These statements were made with- out experimental support. Hewitt (1907, 1910, 1914) regarded the bristles at the margins of the labella and the interpseudotracheal papillae of the house fly, Musca domestica, as the end-organs for taste. He described a channel along the side of the bristles which communicated, according to him, with a nerve-cell at the base, and found at the tip of the papillae an opening leading into a "fine duct which ends in a pyriform sensory bulb." These organs he believed to be for taste, but he had no experiments, and his discoveries with respect to the channels and ducts seem questionable now. R6hler (1906), after reviewing the German work on the subject, described the "Borsten" on the labium of the grasshopper, Tryxalis, as taste-organs. He believed that there are probably other taste-organs in the mouth, which he felt could not be differentiated from ordinary tactile hairs. Berlese (1909), like- wise on purely morphological bases, assigned a gustatory function, or, rather, a combined gustatory-olfactory function, to various types of innervated hairs for insects in general. He designated trichoid, basiconic, and coeloconic sen-</page><page sequence="8">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 609 silla as probably chemoreceptive, assigning a contact chemoreceptive function to those on the mouth-parts and in the mouth. Actually he simply described the possible receptors and did not show that any specific one or all are chemo- receptive. Wheeler (1910), likewise on morphological grounds, supported by the experiments of Forel already discussed, decided that the taste-organs of ants are on the galeae of the maxillae, the tongue, and possibly the palpal tips. Forel (1921) himself later restated his beliefs, and redescribed his experiments and those of Will to back them up. Hochreuther (1912) made a detailed morphological study of the sense- organs of the diving beetle, Dytiscus marginalis, and his results were later incorporated into the monograph on this species by Korschelt (1923). In general he agreed with Nagel, describing the organs which he regarded as gus- tatory as "Geschmackszapfchen." In the larva, he "found" taste-organs on the tips of the antennae and palpi, the mandibles, and the maxillae. In the adult, he did not differentiate between taste and smell and described pit-pegs widely scattered over the body as possibly chemoreceptive. Near the mouth, he regarded the epipharyngeal "Zapfchen" as most important, with similar organs on the palpal tips, and the mandibles and maxillae. These observations wrere not supported by any experimental work. Bugnion and Popoff (1911), Awati (1914), and Davidson (1914) on equally anatomical grounds, described, for certain Hemiptera and Homoptera, supposed taste-organs on the hypopharynx, epipharynx, or wall of the phar- nyx. These statements were based on the fact that these parts seemed to them to be correctly located for taste-organs and are equipped with structures which seemed suitable for taste. In 1916, McIndoo performed experiments like those of Will, using the honey bee as the subject. He fed the bees honey candy, contaminated with salt, quinine, acids, peppermint oil, whisky, etc. Most of the contaminated samples were refused by the bees, and from this work he concluded that the bees possess, on the mouth-parts, a chemical sense which enables them to dis- tinguish between acceptable and unacceptable items of diet. He then studied the sense-organs on the mouth-parts to find a possible receptor. There were only three types present-spine-like hairs, peg-like hairs, and "olfactory pores" (campanifoi:m sensilla). He stated that, since the hairs have chitinous walls, they cannot function as chemoreceptors, for the sense-cells of chemoreceptors must be exposed directly to the stimulating substance. Therefore, he decided, there must be no sense of taste in the bee, the selection being due to an extremely fine sense of smell, mediated through the campaniform sensilla which he believed he had shown to be "olfactory pores" (McIndoo, 1914). This idea he later restated in his review (1920) on the senses of insects. His experiments, however, merely proved that the bee can select its food through some chemical sense, and only the experiments in which non-odorous sub- stances were used are applicable so far as taste is concerned. As Snodgrass</page><page sequence="9">610 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) (1925, p. 63) puts it: "Most entomologists, probably, will not be convinced by this form of reasoning that insects do not taste, since it places too much reliance on a personal interpretation of the functional possibilities of an observed anatomical structure." The modern experimental period of study on contact chemoreceptors of insects dates from the work of Minnich (1921, 1922a and b), in which he demonstrated the presence of tarsal contact chemoreceptors in the butterflies, Vanessa atalanta and Aglais antiopa. Through a series of ingenious experi- ments with butterflies which were immobilized by having the wings clipped together, and using the extension of the proboscis as an index of reception, he established the presence of contact chemoreceptors on the distal part of the first segment and the distal four segments of the tarsi. His work is the first study on the location of gustatory receptors in insects in which exact observa- tion of the reactions of the animals was possible and in which there was con- trol of stimulation by odors and water vapor. The tarsal receptors of butterflies, he found, enable the insects to distinguish sugar solutions and other solutions from water. They, therefore, seem to be common chemical receptors at least, and probably truly gustatory. Here, at last, the search for the taste-organs of insects was broadened and put on a firm experimental basis. The stultifying hypotheses of the earlier anatomists with respect to location and structure were obviously disproved. This does not mean that all attempts to designate specific sensilla as gus- tatory after this were supported by experimental work. There was, however, an increased caution on the part of insect anatomists, and most admitted that they were actually describing only possible receptors, the true nature of which would have to be determined experimentally. Typical of this cautious approach are the papers of Taylor (1931) on Tenthredinids, Henig (1931) on lepidopterous larvae, McIndoo (1931) on the Mexican bean beetle, Hertweck (1931) and Strasburger (1935) on Dros- ophila melanogaster, Welsh (1937) on dipterous larvae, and MacGill (1947) on the bug, Dysdercus, all of whom described sensilla on the mouth-parts which they declared could function as gustatory receptors. They admitted, however, that these were merely possibilities, not proved. Graham-Smith (1930), on the other hand, designated the interpseudo- tracheal papillae on the labella of the blow fly as "gustatory papillae," with no experimental evidence. He did not fully accept Hewitt's designation of the labellar setae as gustatory, even though Minnich (1926b), apparently unknown tc Graham-Smith, had already demonstrated that the hairs on the labellar margins are taste-organs in Phormia regina. Similarly, Weber (1928) declared, without experimental data, that an organ on the inner wall of the labrum and the pharyrnx of Hemiptera is the taste-organ. Later, Weber (1933) repeated this and stated that sensilla, like those found to be gustatory in other insects, at the tip of the proboscis of bugs are for smell at close range and not for taste. Elson (1937) likewise, described on the dorsal</page><page sequence="10">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 611 wall of the pharynx of various species of Hemiptera a "group of sensory cells or glands which lead into the pharynx and function as organs of taste (the gustatory organs)." Since these workers did not support their off-hand assignations of gustatory functions to organs by experimental proof, their work cannot be accepted as indicating more than possible receptors. Demoll (1917), Snodgrass (1926, 1935) and Deegener (1928) have pub- lished reviews on the morphology of insect sense-organs (sensilla). These reports are strictly morphological and, as such, are valuable as indicating the range of forms and positions of the types of sensilla. The authors did not claim to have established any general chemoreceptive type of sensillum, but suggested that the thin-walled trichoid and basiconic sensilla may be the con- tact chemoreceptors. Snodgrass further noted that the sensilla which are possibly chemoreceptive are innervated by a group of nerve-cells instead of by a single cell, as in the types which are probably tactile. All these reviews stated clearly the difficulty encountered in separating insect sensilla into clearly limited structural groups. From the standpoint of experimental work on the location of taste-organs in mandibulate insects, the Coleoptera have been best studied in recent years. Schaller (1926) observed the behavior of dytiscid beetles, before and after removal of various organs and combination of organs, after training the ani- mals to respond to sapid substances. He concluded, from this work, that inner taste-organs are present in the mouth and outer taste-organs on the maxil- lary and labial palpi. Ritter (1936) and Bauer (1938), likewise using critical experimental methods, concluded that, in the water-beetle, Hydrous, inner taste-organs are present in the mouth and outer organs on the tips of the labial and maxillary palpi, though Ritter found the organs on the labial palpi respon- sive only to acids, when the maxillary palpi were removed. Warnke (1931), also using the method of removal of suspected organs, concluded that the taste-organs of two species of scarabeid beetles of the genus, Geotrupes, are on the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi, beilng either the "Kegel" or the "Zapfchen" located there. Other taste-organs, he decided, are probably present, since abolition of the palpi did not completely abolish feeding, though the food had to be held for some time against the mouth-parts to bring about biting after the palpi were removed. Valentine (1931) likewise concluded for the beetle, Tenebrio molitor, that the peg-like sensilla at the distal ends of the palpi have a gustatory function. He reached this conclusion as a result of an experimental study of feeding before and after removal of the palpi. Crombie (1941, 1944), on the other hand, stated that his experiments on the beetle, Rhizopertha dominica, showed that the palpi do not bear chemo- receptors. Since, however, he stated that these beetles do not find food by taste, and he studied their ability to find food, he apparently restricted the term, "chemoreceptors," to distance receptors. In the second paper of this series (1944), he described the tips of the labial and maxillary palpi, figuring sensilla like those found to be contact chemoreceptors by Schaller (1926), Ritter (1936), Bauer (1938), Warnke (1931), and Valentine (1931), but</page><page sequence="11">612 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) stated that they are probably tactile, since his experiments failed to show that they were "chemoreceptive." His experiments definitely did not show that these sensilla may not be tactochemical organs, and his use of the term, "chemoreceptive," in this restricted sense is somewhat confusing. A later study by Crombie and Darrah (1947) on the chemoreceptors of the wireworm showed that the biting response of this animal, which would most likely be the response elicited by contact chemical stimulation, requires receptors on the ligula and galeae. Their statement that "the minute projec- tions on the tips of the labial and maxillary palps are not necessary for this response" is confusing, for, in none of the reported experiments, were the ligula and galeae alone removed. The palpi were removed in all cases with the ligula and galeae, and thus their experiments actually leave the role of the paipi undecided. The conclusion that the palpi bear contact chemoreceptors is, therefore, as justifiable as their indirect suggestion that they do not. Criti- cal extirpation experiments or local stimulation tests like those to be described herein should easily settle this point. Kunze (1933), after a careful study of the antennal contact chemoreceptors of the honey bee, found antennal receptors absent in a cerambycid beetle, Rhagium sp., and the cricket, Liogryllus campestris. While these animals showed no feeding reactions at all when the.antennae were touched, touching the tips of the palpi brought about chewing movements. Frings (1946), in incidental observations made during a study of the sense of taste of the roach, Periplaneta americana, found that the tips of the palpi are sensitive to sapid substances, but other receptors seemed to be present either elsewhere on the mouth-parts or in the mouth or pharynx. In the Lepidoptera, Minnich's work on tarsal chemoreceptors of butter- flies did not go unchallenged. Verlaine (1927) first attacked it on the basis of experiments he performed with the cabbage butterfly, Pieris, rapae. He believed that the proboscis extensions obtained by Minnich were responses to water vapor, viscosity of the solutions, or mechanical stimulation. Minnich (1929b), and Weis (1930), however, have answered these objections very cogently. Minnich noted that, in Verlaine's work, the nutritional state of the animals, particularly with respect to water, was not controlled. This is, of course, of first importance. Weis (1930) and Anderson (1932) showed that cabbage butterflies are difficult experimental subjects, because of their erratic responses to water vapor. Even after being given all the water that they will drink, some individuals give proboscis responses when brought near water. It now seems that Verlaine's objections have been well answered, and indeed he has not pressed them further. It is fair to conclude with Minnich (1921, 1922a), Anderson (1932) and Weis (1930) that tarsal contact chemoreceptors are present in various butter- flies-the nymphalids, Vanessa atalanta, Aglais antiopa, Cercyonis alope, Phyciodes tharos, Basilarchia archippus, Danaus plexippus, the papilionids, Papilio ajax, Papilio machaon, the lycaenid, Heodes thoe, and the pierid,</page><page sequence="12">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 613 Peris rapae Weis reported the following species of moths as unresponsive to tarsal stimulation-Macroglossum 5tellatarum, Acherontia atropos, Sphinx pinastri, and Aglia tau. Both Minnich (1929b) and Weis (1930) agreed with Verlaine that the proboscis, or the mouth itself, or both bear other taste- organs which are important in acceptance or rejection of solutions by the animals, but neither located these further. McIndoo (1929) also challenged Minnich's work on the basis of his pre- vious studies on the honey bee (1914, 1916). He found no organs suitable for reception on the tarsi of butterflies, since he excluded hairs as possible receptors. He did, however, find "olfactory pores" on the tarsi, and concluded that the tarsal chemoreceptors were these, and that taste was not involved, since these pores were olfactory. Once again he stated that the sensilla for chemoreception must have pores through which the nerve endings could reach the outside. Eltringham (1933b), on the other hand, accepting Minnich's and Weis's work, described some possible end-organs on the tarsi of Vanessa atalanta. These are thin-walled hairs found ventrally near the distal ends of the tarsal segments of the middle and hind tarsi. They have terminal threads entering them from sensory cells and running to the tips. He found them in other species, as well, even in one which did not feed in the adult state. For lepidopterous larvae, (Isia isabella, Euchaetias egle), which are man- dibulate, Dethier (1937) reported that gustatory receptors are on the epiphar- ynx and hypopharynx. These he found by stimulating the individual mouth-parts with sucrose and salt solutions on needles, following control tests with dry and moistened needles. He also studied feeding behavior before and after removal of parts. Dethier did not manage to decide on the end- organs involved in this, suggesting that the sinus organs on the epipharynx nmight function but he could find only long and short spines on the hypo- pharynx. The discovery by Minnich of tarsal contact chemoreceptors in Lepidoptera led naturally to a search for these in other haustellate forms. Minnich (1926a) first reported them for three species of blow flies, Phormia regina, P. terrae-novae, and Phaenicia sericata. He showed that the tarsi of these fcrms are sensitive to water and to sucrose solutions, and that receptors are present on the labella as well. The reaction used as an index of reception was the proboscis response. It is interesting to note that Nagel (1894), and Barrows (1907) had both earlier observed the dropping of the proboscis of flies when the tarsi contacted sugar solutions, but neither interpreted the observations correctly nor made any study of these receptors. Abbott (1928) extended the observations on tarsal chemoreceptors in Diptera to include the screw-worm fly, Callitroga macellaria, and showed by his experiments that urea was avoided on tarsal contact by the flies, thus indi- cating that the organs are capable of distingushing between acceptable and Linacceptable substances.</page><page sequence="13">614 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) Minnich (1929b) later published a report of extensive work on the tarsal receptors of the blow fly, Calliphora vomitoria. He used flies which, as in his previous work, were mounted alive by being fastened on wax blocks on the ends of wires. Thus the animals were under careful control, and their nutri- tional states could be accurately controlled. By means of operations, he located the receptors on the fore leg, finding them "present throughout the tarsus and at least the distal portion of the tibia," apparently confined to the ventral surfaces. He made no effort to describe the possible end-organs, but did study the physiology of reception by these organs in some detail. Soon tarsal receptors were reported for other species of flies. Krijgsman (1930) observed that stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans, when sated with water, would drop the proboscis when the tarsi touched horse serum on filter paper, though the odor alone elicited no reaction. Hertweck (1931) mounted Dros- ophila melanogaster and tested like Minnich for tarsal receptors. He found them present and found that the flies could distinguish between sugar-water and sugar-water to which he added poisons. Crow (1932), using methods exactly like those of Minnich, studied the tarsal receptors in Calliphora vicina (C. erythrocephala), Cynomyopsis cadaverina, and two other species of blow flies previously studied by Minnich. Haslinger (1935) also made a detailed physiological study of these receptors in Calliphora vicina for which their presence had already been reported. Dethier and Chadwick (1947) and Chad- wick and Dethier (1947) did likewise for Phorm:za regina. Deonier and Richardson (1935) and Deonier (1938, 1939a, b, and c) extended observa- tions on tarsal receptors to include another species of screw-worm fly, Calli- troga americana, and the house fly, Musca domestica, and they studied the physiology of reception by these organs. Frings and O'Neal (1946) reported tne presence of tarsal receptors in female horse flies, Tabanus sulcifrons, find- ing them on the "ventral sides of the four terminal segments and distal half or two-thirds of the first segment of the three pairs of tarsi." They believed that the receptors are medium-sized hairs found among the longer hairs on the tarsi. This was checked by touching individual hairs. That tarsal receptors may not be present in all Diptera is suggested by the work of Middlekauf (1941) with the fruit flies, Rhagoletis pomonella, R. fausta, and 1R. cingulata. He found that these were unresponsive to tarsal contact with a "10% honey solution," though they responded when this was touched to the mouth-parts. Since, however, he did not use solutions of known concentration, and since he did not test the flies throughout starvation, h-is work cannot be considered as conclusive. The presence of tarsal receptors in Diptera has not gone without challenge. McIndoo (1934, 1938), after his criticism of Minnich's work on butterflies, turned to a study of blow flies. He claimed (1934) to show that the "olfac- tory pores" distributed widely over the body of the blow fly, and not organs oli the antennae and palpi, are the olfactory receptors. He then stated that these pores on the tarsi are the organs studied by Minnich and others, and that the insects distinguish the solutions by the sense of smell and not taste.</page><page sequence="14">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 615 He performed some experiments which he thought showed that the probos- cis response obtained on tarsal stimulation resulted from combined tactile and olfactory stimulation. He touched the tarsi with a needle or placed them on a piece of screening, while sugar-water was held either on a brush or in a watch glass about 3 mm. below, and not in contact with, the tarsi. These stimuli yielded a reaction about half of the time they were applied to the tarsi. Thus, he concluded, the proboscis response was due to combined olfictory and tactile stimuli, the olfactory stimuli being received through the "olfactory pores" on the tarsi, the tactile through the tarsal hairs. As previously, he declared that the tarsal hairs would be impermeable-even possibly unwettable -and that only the "olfactory pores" had the nerve-ends exposed to the out- side. This criticism, however, has been set aside by further studies. Deonier (1938), using Musca domestica, could not duplicate McIndoo's results at all and concluded that the tarsal receptors are really contact chemoreceptors. We, too, without formally reporting it, have tried these experiments with Phormia regina without checking McIndoo's work. Frings (1941) showed, through experiments in which blow flies were trained to respond to odors, that the olfac- tory end-organs of this form are on the antennae and labella. This eliminates the campaniform sensilla as "olfactory pores" in this form. Dethier and Chad- wick (1947) later checked this with Phormia regina. Frisch (1921), Marshall (1935a) and Frings (1944) also showed that the olfactory organs of the honey bee, on which McIndoo's (1914) most extensive work was done, are on the antennae only. This eliminates the "pores" from consideration as "olfactory" in this species. Further, Pringle (1937a and b) has demonstrated, through electrophysiological studies, that the campaniform sensilla are really proprioceptive. McIndoo's experimental results seem probably to be due to lack of control of the state of water satiety of the insects he tested. It seems fair to conclude that his criticism is unjustified, and that the original interpre- tations of Minnich are correct. Hayes and Liu (1947) have recently described hairs on the second to fifth segments of the tarsi of Musca domestica which, by their innervation and their position, seem well suited to be the receptors involved in tarsal chemorecep- tion. Morphological work of the type illustrated by this study which follows and complements physiological work is a fruitful combination of the two dis- ciplines. There has been less done on the receptors of the mouth-parts of flies than on those of the tarsi. Minnich (1926b, 1931), Haslinger (1935) and Deon- ier (1939c) found these on the oral lobes, or labella, of blow flies and the house fly. Minnich (1926b) further attempted to locate the end-organs in- volved in labellar reception. He found that the long hairs at the margins of the labella were sensitive, that touching even one of these with a fine brush dipped in sugar-water elicited an immediate proboscis response from a fly which was unresponsive to contact with a similar brush moistened with water.</page><page sequence="15">616 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) This, he correctly stated, was the first successful demonstration of a particular organ acting as a chemoreceptor. Frings and O'Neal (1946), by touching individual hairs on the labella of female horse flies, Tabanus sulcifrons, witlh fine glass needles moistened with sugar solution, following control tests with moistened needles, showed that the medium-sized hairs among the long hairs on the labella are the contact clhemoreceptors, the long hairs being tactile. The discrepancy between their results and those of Minnich (1926b, 1931) they thought to be due either to species differences or to the possibility that Minnich may have inadvertently moistenied the medium-sized hairs as well as the long hairs. For the horse fly, Frings and O'Neal stated that the tarsal hairs and the labellar hairs may be the only contact chemoreceptors; at least, the tarsi and labella seem to be the sole loci of the end-organs. The only other possible end-organs in this fly would seem to be the interpseudotracheal papillae so favored by the earlier workers. Neither their work nor that of Minnich rules these out as possible gustatory receptors, but neither gives any experimental support to the belief that they are. In the Hymenoptera, Schmidt (1938) has shown, through training experi- ments, that the ant, Myrmica rubra, has contact chemoreceptors on the anten- nae and mouth-parts, but probably not on the fore tarsi. She did not localize the receptors on the mouth-parts further, however. Wasps (Polistes, Vespa), according to Kunze (1933), along with receptors on the mouth-parts, have receptors also on the antennae. Minnich (1932), using honey bees mounted as described before and with adequate nutritional controls, was the first to discover tarsal and antennal con- tact chemoreceptors in this form. The work of Briant (1884) and Breithaupt (1886) has been noted previously, but these workers failed to indicate clearly the nature of reception by the antennae, and they did not follow up their leads. Minnich noted that the tips of the antennae of the bee are sensitive, but there are so many different types of sensilla on the terminal segments of the antennae that he was not able to designate a particular type as the end- organ. He made no attempt to localize the receptors on the tarsi, except to note that he established their presence only on the fore tarsi, the middle tarsi being unsuitable for testing by his method and the hind tarsi giving question- able results. Kunze (1933) further studied antennal contact chemoreception by the hon-ey bee, using methods similar to those used by Minnich. He found, through removal of segments of the antennae, that the receptors are on the eight terminal segments of the flagellum. Frisch (1921) had earlier shown that these segments bear the olfactory organs of the bee, and Kunze believed that the pore-plate organs (sensilla placodea) on the antennae, which Frisch believed are olfactory, might also be gustatory. At least, he pointed out, the trichoid sensilla of the antennae are not the receptors, for drones have none of</page><page sequence="16">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 617 these and their antennae are sensitive to solutions. The later work of Melin (1941) on the pore-plates puts this earlier work in a new light, but does not contribute toward the solution of the problem of exact localization of the taste organs. Marshall (1935a) also studied the tarsal and antennal receptors of the bee, but did not localize them further. In his review (1935b) on olfac- tion in insects, he suggested that thc presence of contact and distance receptors on the antennae of the honey bee might mean that there is no separation between the chemical senses of insects, the chemoreceptors having low thresh- olds being usually olfactory and those having high thresholds being usually gustatory, but each capable of both functions. An entirely new set of possibilities for loci of contact chemoreceptors in insects seems to be opened by the work of Dethier (1947), who has shown that the ovipositors of the hymenopterous parasites, Rhyssa lineolata, Bracon sp. and Nemeritis canescens, possess these organs. He was unable to decide on the exact end-organs involved, but did show that the thresholds of reaction of isolated abdomens of these forms to stimulation of the ovipositor by solu- tions formed series which were like those described for contact chemoreceptive responses of other insects. He concluded, therefore, that the ovipositors of these insects bear similar receptors. During the period from 1922 to the present, the physiological work on contact chemoreception in insects and its importance for insect physiology, and comparative psychology as well, has been reviewed by Frisch (1926), Minnich (1929a), Weber (1933), Eltringham (1933a), Imms (1937), Wigglesworth (1939), Warden, Jenkins and Warner (1940), and Dethier and Chadwick (1948). These give valuable reviews on chemoreception in insects, but little on the location and nature of the receptors, since obviously little is known for sure. The following conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing survey of the literature in this field: 1. The earlier morphological studies, where supported by no experimental wotk or by experiments showing merely the ability of an insect to select its food, simply indicate the possible end-organs for contact chemoreception on the insect body. They contribute little to our knowledge of the actual loci of these organs. 2. Apparently the exoskeleton of the insect is either permeable to sub- stances in solution, or stimulation of contact chemoreceptors does not require a perforated exoskeleton, for the sensilla which have been shown experimentally to be chemoreceptive are not perforated. 3. In some Coleoptera and Orthoptera, it seems probable that thl tips of the maxillary and labial palpi bear contact chemoreceptors, the basiconic sen- silla found at these points being the end-organs. These are not, however, the only receptors. The galeae and ligula, at least, may bear some also, and</page><page sequence="17">618 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) probably other regionis of the mouth-parts as well. The antennae of the man- dibulate forms may lack these receptors. 4. In some species of butterflies, contact chemoreceptors are present on the ventral sides of the tarsi; the end-organs are probably thin-walled hairs. Gus- tatory receptors are present also on the proboscis or in the mouth, the exact loci and sensilla involved beinig unknown. The larvae have contact chemo- receptors on the epipharynx and hypopharynx, but their nature is unknown. 5. In the muscoid Diptera, contact chemoreceptors are present on the ventral sides of the tarsi, the sensilla probably being thin-walled hairs. Similar trichoid gustatory receptors are present on the labella of at least two species of flies, but these may not be the only receptors on the labella. The receptors on the tarsi and labella may be the only receptors in these flies. 6. In the honey bee, besides contact chemoreceptors on the mouth-parts which have not yet been located, tarsal and antennal receptors are also present. Those on the antennae are restricted to the eight terminal segments, but their nature is unknown. Antennal receptors are also present in wasps and ants. Receptors with properties similar to those of the tarsi and mouth-parts are present on the ovipositors of some hymenopterous parasites. 7. Future attempts to find the loci of contact chemoreceptors and to locate the specific end-organs involved must take into account -the possibility that these may be found, at least, on the antennae, mouth-parts including the palpi, tarsi, and ovipositor. The experimental and morphological studies described in the following report have as their object the discovery of the loci of contact chemoreceptors in insects from all the larger orders. In some cases, the studies are incomplete, in others they merely show the difficulties involved in developing critical exper- imental procedures. In others, however, they are complete enough to allow us to decide on probable end-organs for contact chemoreception. It is hoped that this report will stimulate much further experimental work in this field, where so much is needed, and that insect histologists, starting with the knowl- edge that certain sensilla are chemoreceptive, will be able to discover the finer structure of these organs. This will immeasurably aid both the morphologists and the physiologists in their future work. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three species from nine orders were studied in the present work.

Where it was simple to determine the sex, the animals were selected so as to be about half males and half females. Where sex deter- mination was difficult or impossible, relatively large numbers and random collection usually insured approximately half males and half females in the test groups. Where only small numbers of individuals were used, it is obvi- ously possible that members of only one sex were tested, but, except in the Hymenoptera, there was no conscious selection of one sex. For convenience in testing, most of the insects were mounted alive, for the butterflies by fastening the wings together with a spring clothes-pin, and for all others by fastening the dorsal side of the thorax and the wings to a wax-block on the end of a glass rod. This method has been described in detail elsewhere (Frings, 1947) and will not be further discussed here. Lon- gevity was good, if the insects were supplied with water and food regularly. Most insects lived for at least a week and many for two weeks or more. American roaches lived up to seven months thus mounted. There was no evidence that mounting them in this way rendered them abnormal in any respect. The solutions used in the following tests were of two types-acceptable and unacceptable to the insects. As a universally acceptable solution, 1 M sucrose solution was used. As unacceptable solutions, either 2 N NaCI or 2 N NH4CI were used. Normal insects, when starved for a day or two, would accept the sugar solution readily, after being given all the water they would take. They would not accept the salt solutions, however, whether sated with water or not. The usual period of inanition before testing in the following work was one or two days, but, for most species, some individuals were allowed to starve to death and were tested throughout.</page><page sequence="20">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 621 The matter of water satiety in tests on contact chemoreception is of first importance. Most insects, when "thirsty" exhibit active seeking movements or proboscis extensions when moist objects are brought near them. It is abso- lutely essential, therefore, that the insects have all the water they will take before testing with sugar-water. This alone is not enough, however, for an insect which has drunk all it will at the beginning of a series of tests often becomes responsive to water during the tests. It is necessary also that control tests) using water under the same conditions as the sugar solution is to be used, be interspersed-at irregular intervals to avoid any possible conditioning- among the taste tests. Some spzcies-Oncopeltus fcaiciatus, and Pieris rapae, for instance-are quite erratic at all times in their responses to water, even when they will not drink any when offered. Obviously if a positive feeding or other response is obtained when water alone is used, it is necessary to dis- continue testing with the individual that thus responds, offer it water, and then later retest for a negative water reaction. The reactions used as indices of reception of the contact chemical stimuli varied with the insects used. In the mandibulate insects these were usually movements of the mouth-parts along with active extension of the head and seeking movements. Often these were difficult to interpret, and control tests were necessary to discover the reactions to simple contact, so that these could be distinguished, if possible, from reactions to chemical stimulation. With some species of insects-caterpillars for instance-almost anything touching the mouth-parts is sufficient to initiate vigorous chewing movements. In the haustellate insects, the proboscis, which is kept in a position of rest against the body or curled up, is extended on stimulation of contact chemoreceptors. This clean-cut proboscis response makes the haustellate forms particularly apt subjects for these tests. Usually the first tests were for the purpose of establishing the general location of the contact chemoreceptors. For these, fine artist's brushes dipped in water and in the solutions were touched to various parts of the insect's body while the insect was observed under a binocular microscope. In many species the tarsi and antennae were also dipped in liquids in watch-glasses. These tests allowed the experimenter to determine the approximate location of the receptors, and the nature of further work cdepended upon the results of these tests. For exact location, two methods of testing were used: local stimulation, and removal of suspected loci. For the local stimulation tests the insect was left intact, though some appendages might be immobilized by being fastened in the wax or drawn against the insect's body by means of a strip of paper fastened in the wax block on each side (further information about these "dresses" may be found in Frings and O'Neal, 1946). Water and solutions were brought to the parts of the insect on very fine glass needles made by drawing out narrow bore glass tubing or glass rod. The parts of the insects to be tested were touched first with a dry glass needle, followed by a glass needle moistened with distilled water. The reactions to these mechanical stimuli were noted. After that, the parts were touched with a needle moist-</page><page sequence="21">622 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) ened with sucrose solution. If the parts bore receptors and if the animal were hungry, this ordinarily elicited the typical feeding reaction. The routine was varied widely, according to the circumstances, so that repeated tests were some- times made with the control needles, before a test was made with the sugar solution, and many other similar variations. All these tests were carried out with the insect under the highest practical power of the binocular microscope. For the removal experiments, various parts were cut off and the insects were tested before and after the operations. These operations were performed under a dissecting microscope with microscalpels made from small pieces of razor-blades. Usually the insects were anaesthetized for the operation, but not always. The extent of the operation was checked with the binocular micro- scope and usually later by mounting the part on a microslide and examining under the compound microscope. The animals were not tested until their re- actions showed them to be completely recovered from the anaesthesia. The interpretation of local stimulation studies is often difficult. As a general rule, it seems safe to say that negative results (i.e., lack of distinctive feeding behavior following contact with sugar solutions) do not constitute proof of lack of reception, unless backed up by other data. It is possible, especially when using small volumes of fluid, as with glass needles, that an insufficient stimulus occurred. It is also possible that the reaction selected as an index of response, while elicited by contact with a galaxy of taste-organs, is not elicited by contact with a few organs: On the other hand, positive results (i.e., evocation of distinctive feeding behavior following contact with sugar solutions), if care is taken to avoid touching other parts, is an excellent indication of reception. Either of these general statements, obviously, depends on having the animals sated with respect to water and having adequate controls. Removal experiments also are often difficult to interpret, and, indeed have often been misinterpreted, even by careful workers. Forel (1900, as trans- lated by Yearsley, 1908 p. 104) thus described an experiment he performed: "I therefore amputated both antennae and the four palpi in several wasps. Then I gave them honey mixed with quinine. It was naturally necessary to bring them so that their mouth touched the honey, for they were not in a condition to find it alone. They then tasted it, but abandoned it each time immediately after. On the contrary, when I put pure honey without quinine or morphine, they ate it greedily. This shows that the gustatory faculty is independent of the antennae and the palpi, and that it resides in the mouth." Obviously it shows nothing of the sort with respect to the antennae and palpi. It does show that, with the antennae and palpi removed, these insects could still distinguish acceptable from unacceptable foods, presumably on the basis of a contact chemical sense in or near the mouth. The palpi and antennae, however, so far as can be decided on the basis of these experiments, may or may not bear end-organs. Similarly, Crombie and Darrah (1947), after showing nicely that the an- tennae are not the loci of end-organs which are necessary for the biting re- sponse of wireworms, found that removal of the labial palpi, maxillary palpi, ligula, and galeae abolished the response. Removal of the maxillary and labial palpi and the ligula, leaving the galeae, did not abolish the response. They</page><page sequence="22">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 623 concluded: "Normal biting occurs when only the galeae are present, showing that the minute projections on the tips of the labial and maxillary palps are not necessary for this response." Actually, these experiments do not show that the palpi are unnecessary for this response, for the palpi were removed in all their tests. All that is indicated is that the galeae are sensitive and that, if the palpi bear end-organs, these are not the only ones present. Many examples of similar misinterpretation could be selected, but these two examples from the work of competent and careful research biologists show how easy it is to misinterpret extirpation experiments. As a general rule, if removal of a part does not abolish the response being used as an index of reception, the part either does not bear the end-organs or it is not the sole locus of the end-organs. On the other hand, if removal of a part does abolish the response it is possible that it does bear the end-organs. If this is sup- ported by other experimental results, final conclusions may be possible. When, in our experiments, it was suspected that all the contact chemo- receptors were removed by the operations, thirsty animals were given salt solutions, varied in presentation with distilled water. Normal animals, of course, took the water and refused the salt solutions. Indiscriminate accept- ance of salt solutions and water was taken as indicative of lack of contact chemoreceptive capacity. For these tests, moistened artists' brushes were used instead of glass needles, so that sizeable droplets could be presented to the thirsty animals. A further difficulty in the study of the location of contact chemoreceptors is that they seem to be present on the mouth-parts of all insects, and move- ments of the mouth-parts are the most usual innate reaction to contact chemical stimulation. It is thus often difficult to remove parts suspected of bearing chemoreceptors without also seriously affecting the ability of the insects to respond. In testing any of the appendages for contact chemoreceptors by local stimulation, difficulty was occasionally experienced with the insects' bringing the parts to which the solutions were applied to the mouth-parts. With many insects this touching of the mouth-parts with moveable appendages is a source of considerable trouble. The precautions taken to avoid this varied with the species, the most usual being the use of small amounts of liquid and careful observation. When tarsal receptors were present, the movements of the legs by the insects often interfered with the testing of parts lying closer to the body. In these cases, the tarsi were usually immobilized by being fastened to the insect or were removed. In the honey bee, where the antennae bear re- ceptors, it was necessary to remove these from the field of action in testing other parts. The collar described by Marshall (1935a) was found to be quite satisfactory for this purpose. Tests were also made on free animals, especially in testing for tarsal receptors. The insects were placed in finger-bowls or Petri dishes with filter paper on the floor. Here they were supplied with distilled water but not food, and, in a few days, they were naturally quite hungry. It was easy to show that these animals, while not taking water and therefore unresponsive to water vapor, would eagerly take sugar-water when brought to the mouth-</page><page sequence="23">624 HTIE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATIJRALIST 41 (3) parts. The testing for tarsal receptors was accomplished either by placing drops of sugar-water on the tarsi of the animals, as they stood in the dishes, or by placing drops on the filter paper thus allowing them to move by capil- larity to the tarsi of the insects. As a control, distilled water droplets were similarly applied. The solutions used in this method, if they were applied as drops to the tarsi, were maintained at the same temperature as the room. If this was not done, thermal stimulation of the tarsi caused the insect either to bring the tarsi to the mouth-parts or to bring the palpi or other regions of the mouth-parts to the drops and thus to discover them without true tarsal reception. For microscopic study of the sensilla found on the mouth-parts, tarsi, and so on, these parts were mounted whole in Diaphane on microstides. Some of these were stained with alcoholic methylene blue or with hematoxylin before mounting. No histological sections of the parts have been prepared. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXPERIMENTS The most extensive series of experiments were made with Periplaneta americana. These will be presented first in some detail to show the general methods and controls used. The other forms were similarly treated, and detailed data will, therefore, be omitted and the results of the experiments summarized. Periplaneta americana, American Cockroach.-Touching either antenna with a dry glass needle elicits withdrawal, if the antenna is touched at a distance of more than about 1 cm. from the head. Often this is accompanied by general activity, such as kicking. If the antenna is touched at a distance of less than 1 cm. from the head, the animals reach with the maxillary palpi toward the source of stimulation. Exactly the same reactions are obtained with needles dipped in water, sugar-water, or salt solutions. Continued stimu- lation abolishes the response through habituation, and stimulation of the an- tennae of roaches which are cleaning or "sleeping" results in no observable reaction. From many replications of these observations, using artist's brushes as well as needles, it seems fair to conclude that the antennae bear no con- tact chemoreceptors. Touching the fore tarsi with a dry glass needle elicits either withdrawal, or more usually reaching for the needle with the maxillary palpi. With the needle moistened with water, sugar-water, or salt solutions, no observable dif- ferences are found. Often the roach tries to draw the needle to the palpi. If this is prevented, there are no feeding movements. If the animal succeeds, chewing movements start as soon as a needle moistened with sugar-water touches the palpal tips. With the middle and hind tarsi, the typical reaction to contact is withdrawal of the appendages; there are no observable differences in reaction with sugar-water or salt solutions. When other segments of the legs are touched, the palpi are moved toward the stimulated part. Contact chemoreceptors are thus probably not present on the legs. Touching the cerci elicits only withdrawal or no reaction at all, depending on the degree of stimulation afforded, with no differences between control and test needles. Contact of the needles with other parts of the body results in</page><page sequence="24">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 625 no reactions which can be interpreted as indicative of contact chemoreception. The contact chemoreceptors involved in feeding behavior, therefore, seem to be limited to the region near the mouth. When the tip of a maxillary palpus is touched with a dry needle or one moistened with water, the palpus is withdrawn, and often the roach exhibits slight bouncing movements of the body, with movements of the legs. When the tip of this palpus is touched with a needle moistened with sugar-water, on the other hand, the roach's head is immediately extended, the palpi are waved eagerly around, and chewing movements occur. This typical reaction pattern, which is followed by feeding, if that is permitted, is useful as an index of response. It is obvious that the tips of the maxillary palpi bear gustatory receptors. These can be more precisely located by local stimulation under a binocular microscope. Only the terminal segment of the palpus is sensitive, and that only along the ventral side of the segment near the tip. Along this side there is a special field of sensilla, ovoid in shape. This area can easily be shown to be the receptor field. Fig. 1 is a photomicrograph of a maxillary palpus of P. americana showing this sensory field. With the maxillary palpi excised, it is possible to touch the labial palpi. Unless the maxillary palpi are excised, the roach brings their tips into contact with the needle as soon as it touches a labial palpus. When the tips of the labial palpi are touched with sugar-water there is an immediate feeding reac- tion. Local stimulation experiments showed that the receptors here were con- fined to the tips, in a well defined sensory field (Fig. 1). Other parts of the labial palpi, while obviously well supplied with tactile receptors, apparently do not bear contact chemoreceptors. Fig. 1.-(Left) Right half of labium of Periplaneta americana (X22) showing the light colored sensory field at the tip of the palpus. (Right) Maxillary palpus of P. amer- icana (X17) showing the light colored sensory field along the ventral side of the terminal segment.</page><page sequence="25">626 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) With the palpal tips removed, roaches are not able to distinguish sugar- water from distilled water until it is brought into contact with the mouth- parts. Then, however, they can easily distinguish between the two, taking sugar-water eagerly, when sated with water. They can also distinguish salt solutions from water, taking the water, when thirsty, but not the salt solu- tions. Thus, there are contact chemoreceptors present on the mouth-parts other than on the palpal tips. Using very fine needles, it is possible to touch specific points on the mouth- parts of a roach without touching the palpi, or the palpi may be excised and other regions thus stimulated. These experiments showed that the tip of the labium and the hypopharynx are sensitive to chemicals. To test this further, the palpi were removed and then various combinations of excisions were per- formed. With the palpi removed, and either the ligula or hypopharynx re- moved, the roaches can still distinguish sugar and salt solutions from distilled water, when brought to their mouth-parts either on a glass needle, an artists' brush or as a droplet on a small piece of glass microslide fastened to the end of a short glass rod (see Frings, 1946, for description of this piece of ap- paratus). With the palpal tips excised and with both the hypopharynx and the ligula removed, however, the roaches indiscriminately refuse all fluids or take all fluids, depending on their nutritional state. It would seem, therefore, that the sole loci of contact chemoreceptors in or near the mouth of the roach, are the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi, the hypopharynx, and the ligula. Animals with these parts removed take salt solutions when thirsty just as they do water, something which no normal roach does. When hungry, but sated with water, they exhibit no feeding response, even when rather large droplets of sugar solution are brought to the mouth-parts. This is true even when a long enough time is given (up to 3 minutes) for the sugar solution to reach any receptors on the epipharynx or in the mouth cavity. There seem to be no effective receptors at these places. To test this quantitatively, thresholds for sucrose were determined with TABLE I.-Thresholds for sucrose for the American cockroach with excisions of the parts listed.

The data are pre- sented in Table I. The slight discrepancy between the threshold reported here for normal roaches and the threshold reported previously (Frings, 1946) is undoubtedly due to the small number used here and to the fact that these were from a different group of roaches than those used in the previous work. The rise in threshold following removal of the palpal tips and hypopharynx suggests that the labial tip alone is less sensitive than the hypopharynx. It has been suggested earlier (Frings, 1946) that the palpal tips are not as sensi- tive as the "inner" organs. Unfortunately, roaches with the "inner" organs removed and with only the palpal tips have not been tested. These results show plainly that, so far as the mouth-parts are concerned, the receptors for contact chemical stimulation are on the tips of the palpi, the hypopharynx, and the ligula. So far as can be determined, no other con- tact chemoreceptors exist on the mouth-parts or in the mouth or pharynx. The presence or absence of tarsal or antennal receptors were also tested for by observations on unmounted roaches confined in fingerbowls, and given no food, but all the water they wanted. As the roaches moved about, the maxillary palpi were kept in active motion touching the floor of the bowl with the sensory fields at the tips. If these touched a drop of sugar-water, the roach immediately sucked it up. Merely walking through the drop of sugar- water did not bring about feeding. Drops of water and sugar-water were placed on the tarsi as the animals stood quietly in the dishes. In a few cases the roaches lifted the tarsi from the drops and brought them to the mouth- parts. These responses, however, apparently were due to, differences in tem- perature between the fluids and the dishes, for when these were the same, it was possible to flood the feet of starving roaches with sugar-water without any sign of recognition on their part. If, however, the maxillary palpi touched the fluid, the roaches immediately began active feeding. The antennae and cerci, tested similarly seemed equally to lack contact chemoreceptors. Free roaches with the maxillary palpi removed, after a short period of ad- justment, brought the body lower so that the tips of the labial palpi touched the substrate as they walked. Sugar-water was recognized on contact with the palpi and feeding commenced. With both labial and maxillary palpi removed, the roaches seemed almost incapable of finding sugar solutions, walking through droplets indiscriminately. If thirsty, they recognized water, however, apparently through some water-vapor sense. But, if not thirsty, removal of the palpi seriously affected their finding of food droplets, provided these, as in the present experiments, were without food odor. However, if the mouth- parts of a palpectomized roach touched a droplet accidentally, feeding oc- curred immediately. With all the suspected loci of contact chemoreceptors removed (palpal tips, ligular tip, hypopharynx), the roaches easily found and imbibed water when thirsty, though they also took salt solutions too, which no normal or palpectomized roach did. These roaches, however, seemed incapable of dis- tinguishing drops of sugar-water from plain water, and thus, if sated with water, starved without feeding on drops of sucrose solution lying all around. They did, however, seem able to recognize dog-biscuit, moving the antennae actively when it was brought near them, and, if it were placed against the</page><page sequence="27">628 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) mouth-parts, chewing slowly (cf. also Glaser, 1927). The recognition here apparently depends on olfactory stimuli, mediated probably through the antennae. From the results cited above, it is obvious that the contact chemoreceptors involved in feeding behavior in the American cockroach are located on the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi, the tip of the hypopharynx, and the ligula. Blattella germanica, German Cockroach.-All the experiments which were done with the American cockroach, except the determination of thresholds, were done with this species. The results were exactly the same. The contact chemoreceptors of this insect, therefore, are also located on the tips of the palpi, the hypopharynx, and the ligula. Gryllus assimilis, Field Cricket.-Only experiments utilizing brushes for general location were done with this species. These showed that the antennae, legs, and cerci lack receptors, while the palpal tips and some other regions of the mouth-parts bear them. These results check those of Kunze (1933). Since excisions of the palpi were not performed, the loci of the end-organs on the mouth-parts were not determined accurately. Melanoplus differentialis, Differential Grasshopper.-A11 the experiments which were performed with P. americana, except t he determination of thresholds, were done with this species. There was no evidence that the ligula bears receptors, otherwise the situation was similar. Removal of the palpal tips, on which there are clearly delimited sensory fields, and the hypo- pharynx apparently abolished reception. The only contact chemoreceptors of this species seem to be on the palpal tips and the hypopharynx. It is in- teresting to compare this with the case of the roaches and to relate this to the differences in food habits between these two types of insect. Also, this differ- ence in the loci of receptors between two species from closely related groups shows clearly the impossibility of using data obtained in a study on one species to postulate conditions in another. Tenodera a. sinensis, Chinese Mantis.-The tests with this organism were incomplete, omitting excisions and determinations of thresholds. All observa- tions were on free animals. The results showed that the antennae, tarsi, and cerci probably do not bear receptors, while the palpal tips are sensitive. Other receptors are also present, as indicated by the chewing movements resulting when the mouth-parts were touched with sugar-water, without touching the palpi. The loci of contact chemoreceptors are thus the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi and some other points on the mouth-parts. Thermobia domestica, Firebrat.-This insect proved to be an exasperating experimental animal. Some of the individuals responded to almost any stimu- lation near the mouth-parts, and many more responded to sugar-water very poorly. Because of the erratic nature of the responses, results were not clear- cut, and, while many individuals were used in these tests, the interpretations are not as definite here as in the other insects tested. All the experiments done with P. americana, except determinations of thresholds, were tried. It is</page><page sequence="28">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RFCEPTORS IN INSECTS 629 almost certain that the antennae, tarsi and posterior bristles do not have con- tact chemoreceptors. The maxillary palpi are relatively long and filiform, and the labial palpi short and thick (Fig. 2). The maxillary palpi are carried extended, the labial palpi folded against the labium. Local stimulation of these showed that the maxillary palpi almost certainly do not bear contact chemoreceptors, while the tips of the labial palpi are definitely loci of such receptors. Local stimulation of the tip of the labium showed that this too was sensitive. Excisions have failed so far to elicit further information as to these receptors. Chrysopa sp., Golden-Eyed Lacewing. Only local contact experiments with glass needles were performed with this species. The antennae and tarsi Fig. 2.-(Above) Maxilla of Thermobia domestica (X55). (Below) Labium of T. domestica (X80). Both specimens from prepared slides stained with methylene blue.</page><page sequence="29">630 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) apparently do not bear receptors, while the tips of the palpi are very sensitive. Libellula sp., Dragon-Fly.-This animal proved even more uncooperative than the firebrat. All the experiments tried with P. americana were done with these, except for the determination of thresholds and tests with free animals. The insects are very tight-mouthed and difficult to test locally. When sated with water, they would sometimes take sugar-water, with chewing movements. This reaction seemed at first to be a good index of reception, but it failed miserably. Often it seemed as if the dragon-fly had no receptors at all, for they would take almost anything offered to them, even 2 N NH4CI solution. Feeling that the presentation of droplets was not adequate, tiny balls of cotton soaked in water, sugar-water, and 2 N NH4CI were offered. When sated with water, some individuals rejected the NH4CI and water soaked balls and accepted the ones soaked in sugar-water, but others took all indiscriminately. While mounted, dragon-flies were fed on small bits of meat. If these were soaked in 2 N NH4CI solution, they were often taken just as readily as untreated meat. The most that can be said so far is that the antennae and legs do not seem to bear any receptors, and the mouth-parts probably do, but the exact location on the mouth-parts remains to be determined. Galeritd janus, Ground Beetle.-All the experiments tried with P. amerl- cana except the determination of thresholds and attempts to remove all contact chemoreceptors, were tried with these animals. The antennae and legs obvi- ously lack receptors. The tips of the maxillary palpi (Fig. 4) and labial palpi bear contact chemoreceptors in definite fields. The tips of the maxillae and the mandibles bear no receptors, but the tip of the labium is quite sensitive. The receptors discovered thus far, then, are on the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi and the tip of the labium, but others may be present. Epicauta pennsylvanica, Black Blister Beetle.-The results here were exactly like those with G. janus above. The contact chemoreceptors are on the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi, the labial tip, and possibly elsewhere on the mouth-parts. Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus, Soldier Beetle.-A very detailed set of ex- periments was performed with these animals. The results will be only briefly summarized. The feeding reaction is clear-cut and quite easy to observe. It consists of opening of the mandibles and extension of the maxillae, as a proboscis-like structure. The extension occurs in two phases-1. extension of the lateral pieces, and 2. extension of the long tongue-like central parts. Reaction 1 occurs on stimulation of the palpal tips with sugar-water, but reac- tion 2 only occurs after some of the sugar-water has been imbibed. Touching the tips of the extended maxillae with sugar-water, water, or salt solutions elicits sucking, but water and salt solutions are rejected when a little of the material has been taken up. The receptors, obviously are not on the tips of the maxillae, but lie deeper. The antennae and tarsi bear no receptors. It seems, therefore, that the loci of contact chemoreceptors for this species are the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi and elsewhere on the mouth-parts.</page><page sequence="30">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 631 TABLE II.-Summary of results of experiments on the location of the contact chemoreceptors in mandibulate insects.

Receptors are on the palpal tips and the tip of the labium, but these may not be all that the animal has. Summary of Results on the Mandibulate Orders.-The results of the ex- periments on the mandibulate insects are summarized in Table II. These show that, where the loci of end-organs could be determined accurately, the maxillary palpi (except probably for the firebrat) and the labial palpi bear them at their tips. For the beetles, these results check those of Schaller (1926), Ritter (1936), Bauer (1938), Warnke (1931), Valentine (1931). and Kunze (1933). Other receptors are present on the mouth-parts in all. Where located accurately, these were found on the labial tip, except in the grasshopper, and on the hypopharynx. The mandibles probably do not bear contact chemoreceptors and the labrum possibly not. In those insects in which complete removal of all receptors was attempted no evidence was found to indicate that receptors exist in the mouth or pharynx. The antennae, tarsi, and cerci where present, of these forms, seem not to bear contact chemore- ceptors. Oncopeltus fasciatus, Large Milkweed Bug.-The loci of contact chemo- receptors were determined by local stimulation methods, using both brushes and needles, and by removal followed by exposure of parts to solutions in watch-glasses. This animal is not an easy experimental subject with which to work. The reactions to water are erratic and often confusing. To render the bugs negative to water, it is necessary to allow them to have all the water they wish over a period of some time, usually for more than an hour. The animals were suspended for this period over a dish full of water, and a sur- prising number of them kept the proboscis lowered for most of that time. Control tests with water were necessary in a ratio of three or four to one application of sucrose solution. The milkweed bug does not become reactive to sucrose solutions until after 2 or 3 days of inanition and then not all indi- viduals respond. The reactions are slow, and consequently up to 30 seconds' periods of exposure were used. With intact animals, it is simple to discover, by dipping the tarsi into solutions in watch-glasses, that receptors are present either on the antennae, or tarsi or both. The difficulty with using intact animals is that the fore tarsi can reach as far as the antennae and vice versa. Thus the bug almost invari- ably brings the fore tarsi and antennae simultaneously into contact with solu- tions. With the antennae removed, however, the insects can distinguish sucrose solutions from distilled water with the tarsi. Local stimulation and removal of legs, followed by dipping the remaining legs in water and solutions in watch-glasses, showed that all the tarsi are capable of reception. The seg- ments of the tarsi which are active have l1ot so far been discovered. With the fore legs, or fore and middle legs removed, the insects seem incapable of dis- tinguishing sugar solution from distilled water by means of the antennae. Unfortunately, animals with these legs removed tend to hold the antennae up above the body in such a way as to make it difficult to touch them to sugar-</page><page sequence="32">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 633 water in a watch-glass. Touching with a brush moistened with sucrose solu- tion, following distilled water controls, however, elicits no proboscis response. In view of the possibility that a higher concentration of sucrose might be effective, all the experiments were repeated using 2 M sucrose solution. The results were the same. The antennae, thus, seem to bear no contact chemo- receptors. Using glass needles, under a binocular microscope, it is possible to bring water and solutions to the tip of the proboscis without touching the tarsal receptors. At the tip of the proboscis there is visible a group of sense-organs. If these are touched with water, after the animal has had its fill of water, no reaction occurs. If, however, they are touched with sugar-water, sucking starts immediately and there are visible movements of the end of the proboscis and possibly the stylets. If they are touched with salt solutions, the proboscis is withdrawn and the animals regurgitate. It thus seems certain that the tip of the proboscis bears contact chemoreceptors. Other receptors may be present, and thus the organs described by Weber (1928), Elson (1937), and MacGill (1947) on the epipharynx or wall of the pharynx may be gustatory. Weber's (1933) statement, however, that the sense-organs at the tip of the proboscis of bugs are not taste-organs is incorrect, at least so far as Oncopeltus fasciatus is concerned. Pieris rapae, Imported Cabbageworm Butterflies.-The insects were mount- ed by clipping the wings together with spring clothes-pins, and were tested only by dipping the tarsi and proboscis in watch-glasses containing water and sucrose solution. Operations were performed to locate the segments of the tarsi involved. The receptors were thus found to be on all the tarsal segments of the fore tarsi, on the middle tarsi, probably at the same places, and at the tip of the proboscis. The reactions of this animal to water-vapor complicate the testing greatly. As noted by Minnich (1929b) and Anderson (1932), this butterfly is difficult to bring to zero response to water and is not always consistent in reactions. With this word of caution, the following seem to bear no receptors: the antennae, parts of the legs other than the tarsi, and the tarsi of the hind legs. The results with the hind tarsi were quite spotty; occasion- ally the insects seemed to give a little evidence of reception, when the fore and middle legs were removed, but more often not. The occasional positives could have been caused by accidentally touching the proboscis to the solution in the watch-glass. In some cases, also, the animals drank water, after giving what seemed a positive response to sucrose solution, and were later entirely negative to the solution. The situation with respect to the hind legs, there- fore, needs further clarification. Colias philodice, Clouded Sulfur Butterfly.-The results were almost iden- tical with those in P. rapae. The tarsi of the fore and middle legs and tip of the proboscis bear contact chemoreceptors, the antennae not. This species, as P. rapae, is difficult to work with, because of the irregular responses to water and water-vapor. Danaus plexippus, Monarch Butterflies.-The larvae were tested by fasten-</page><page sequence="33">634 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) ing them dorsal side down on wax blocks, holding the animals in place with strings fastened in the wax. All the experiments were done by local stimula- tion. The criterion used for reception was, as in the experiments of Dethier (1937), feeding movements to sucrose solution, following neutral responses to water. Unfortunately, the insects have the habit of moving the mouth- parts at all sort of provocations-touching, applying water, etc. The experi- ments indicated, however, that the maxillary palpi, especially the medially directed papillae, and the tip of the hypopharynx bear receptors. Results with the epipharynx and other regions were unsatisfactory, because of the movements noted above. An interesting observation was made with the tarsi. If these were moistened with water, the insects gave no indication of a response to this, but, if moistened with sucrose solution, the tarsi were brought to the mouth-parts and the material removed. Does this mean that the tarsi of the caterpillars of this form bear contact chemoreceptors? Our experiments so far do not allow us to answer this unequivocally either way. The larvae of Lepidoptera are, of course, inandibulate, and the present results and those of Dethier (1937) are fully concordant with the results obtained with other mandibulate forms. The palpi, and hypopharynx bear gustatory end-organs, and the epipharynx (Dethier, 1937) probably does also. The adults were tested with all the methods used with P. americana, except determination of thresholds, and with the addition of gross stimulation of the tarsi with solutions in watch-glasses. The results were quite clear-cut, since the reactions of this butterfly are clear and unmistakable, and the water response is easy to control. In tests for receptors on the proboscis the tarsi were either removed or the legs were held against the bodies of the insects by strips of paper fastened in the wax blocks. All the individuals used in these tests were reared from larvae collected in the field, and were mounted, the day after emergence from the pupa, by fastening the wings together with spring clothes-pins. The antennae, palpi, and rudimentary fore-legs do not bear gustatory receptors. Segments 2 to 5 and the distal end of segment 1 of the tarsi of the middle and hind legs bear receptors. All other parts of the legs do not. The proboscis bears receptors at the tip and for at least 20 mm. back. With the terminal 20 mm. of the proboscis removed the animals cannot distinguish sugar-water from distilled water, but they do not take salt solutions. This may, however, be due to stimulation by the salts of the cut ends of nerves. At least, the terminal portion of the proboscis bears these receptors, and others may be present either on the proboscis or in the mouth itself. The present experiments add one new species of butterfly, C. philodice, to the list of those known to have tarsal receptors and check previous work of Minnich (1921, 1922a and b) and Anderson (1932) on two others. It would seem, therefore, that tarsal chemoreceptors are widely distributed in the butterflies, but so far only negative findings have been reported for moths (Weis, 1930). Eristalis sp., Drone Fly.-Using local stimulation and extirpation methods,</page><page sequence="34">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 635 the end-organs were found to be on the labella and on the tarsi of all the legs, thc fore tarsi secming most sensitive. The labellar receptors are relatively short hairs at the margins, particularly at the anterior end of the labella. At the posterior angle of the labella there are also long hairs present, but these seem to be only tactile. Touching them with a dry grass needle, or one mois- tened with distilled water, causes only a rippling movement of the labella, and touching them with a needle moistened with sugar-water causes no different response. With the anteriorly located, shorter hairs, touching with a glass needle with sucrose solution brings about an immediate proboscis response. The antennae and palpi seem to lack gustatory receptors. Phormia regina, Black Blow Fly.-The experiments were similar to those already discussed at length in the paper on the horse fly (Frings and O'Neal, 1946), consisting of local stimulation and extirpation tests. The tarsi and possibly the distal ends of the tibiae of the fore, middle, and hind legs bear receptors. All other parts of the legs lack them. The labella also have recep- tors, and local stimulation experiments showed these to be the slightly curved shorter hairs lying among the longer tactile hairs. Since this conclusion differs from that of Minnich (1926b) with the same species, it might be worthwhile to suggest a possible explanation. Minnich used fine brushes in his work, and with these he touched individual hairs, that is the long hairs at the margins. It is our experience that, unless a brush is trimmed until the point consists of single hair (and that would have to be extremely fine), it is impossible to touch just one of the tactile hairs without concomitantly touching one of the shorter hairs as well. With a fine glass needle, it is possible to bend an individual tactile hair and thus to note that, when the needie is moistened with sugar solution, the reaction obtained is the same as that obtained with a dry needle. Reaching in nearer the proboscis with the needle, however, so as to touch the shorter hairs, brings about an immediate response. The experiments are complicated by occasional responses on the part of some of the flies to contact alone, especially if very hungry, and by the limits of stability of the human hand when working under a micro- scope. It seems, therefore, that Minnich, in his work, may have unwittingly touched the shorter hairs lying so thickly among the longer ones, and thus obtained the responses he reports. The antennae and palpi apparently do not bear contact chemoreceptors. In fact, removal of the tarsi and terminal portions of the tibiae of all the legs with the labella, so far as could be told by these experiments, rendered the insects unable to taste. Insects thus treated accepted water, sugar-water, and salt solutions indiscriminately. The tarsi and labella, therefore, may be the sole loci of contact chemoreceptors in this species. Phaenicia sericata, Green-bottle Fly.-The results were similar to those for P. regina, as might be expected, but not so complete a series of experiments was performed.

The four terminal segments of the tarsi of the legs bear contact chemoreceptors. The shorter hairs on the labella are contact chemoreceptors, while the longer ones seem to be tactile, as in P. regina. The hairs on the labella of this species seem even more clearly visible than those of P. regina, and thus the results were very distinct. The antennae and palpi do not bear receptors. Thus the statements by Wesche (1904) and Lowne (1870, 1890) that the palpi bear taste-organs are inc&amp;orrect so far as can be determined now. These experi- ments fully check the work of Deonier (1938, 1939c) and Deonier and Richardson (1935) on this species. Thus, for the Diptera, these experiments add one new species, Eristalis sp., to those already known to have tarsal receptors and check the previous work on two other species. They further show that hairs, usually not the longest hairs, on the labella are the gustatory end-organs. The tarsal organs and these hairs on the labella, with the possibility that the interpseudotracheal papillae may be active, may be the only contact chemoreceptors in the flies tested so far. Polistes sp., Polistes Wasp.-The "proboscis response" used as an index of reception is quite distinctive, consisting of extension of the labium. The palpal tips, the fore tarsi and the antennae bear receptors. The middle and hind tarsi seem relatively insensitive, and may lack receptors entirely. Receptors on the antennae are located on all the segments except possibly the basal one (scape). The tip of the labium (glossae and paraglossae) also bears recep- tors, and there are probably others, but these have so far not been located. Vespula maculata, Bald-Faced Hornet.-Only an incomplete series of tests was made with this species. The palpi definitely have end-organs on their tips. The antennae and tarsi, however, seem not to bear receptors, but the evidence is inconclusive. Kunze (1933) found the antennae of both Vespa and Polistes bearing receptors. This study confirms that fact for Polistes, but possibly not for Vespa. Our results, however, for the latter were not conclusive. Apis mellifera, Honey Bee.-The experiments with this animal were like those performed on other haustellate types. The tarsi of the fore legs bear receptors, as Minnich (1932) and Marshall (1935a) found. The 8 terminal segments of the antennae also have receptors, as Kunze (1933) discovered. The tarsi of the middle and hind legs do not seem to bear contact chemore- ceptors. When the fore tarsi are removed and care is taken to avoid touching the antennae with the needles or brushes used to touch the middle and hind tarsi, no responses are obtained. With the thought in mind that the middle and hind tarsi would be less sensitive than the fore tarsi, solutions of sucrose up to 2 M in strength were used witllout clear-cut evidence of reception by these parts. Contact chemoreceptors are present on the mouth-parts, probably on the glossa (tongue), but so far these have not been located. Operations on the tongue are difficult, and they interfere critically with the proboscis response whiich is the index of reception. The labial palpi may or may not bear recep-</page><page sequence="36">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 637 TABLE III.-Summary of results of experiments on the location of the contact chemoreceptors in haustellate insects.

The evidence is inconclusive. Touching the palpi with sugar water usually elicits no response. This might be interpreted as meaning that the labial palpi bear no receptors for taste. The fact that the tip of the proboscis ordinarily is not stimulated previous to proboscis extension, however, suggests that stimulation of the palpi may not be the adequate stimulus for this reflex. Summary of Results on the Haustellate Orders.-The results of the exper- iments on the haustellate orders are presented in brief in Table III. In the adults of these orders, tarsal organs are usually present, but antennal receptors seem to be restricted to Hymenoptera. The receptors on the mouth-parts are u.sually found at or near the tip of the proboscis. In species in which prob- ably all the receptors were located, these receptors were the only ones found. MORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES Periplaneta americana.-Photomicrographs of the labium and maxillary palpus are presented in Fig. 1. The regions at the tips of the palpi found to be sensitive in the experimental studies are easily visible. The sensory field on the maxillary palpus, when examined with higher magnification (Fig. 4), can be seen to bear two types of sensilla-a few long trichoid sensilla (about 45 to 55 ,u long) and a large number of basiconic sensilla (about 15 ,u long). Since the trichoid type is found all' along the palpus, but the whole extent of the palpus is not sensitive to chemical stimulation, it seems reasonable to assume that the basiconic sensilla are the end-organs. This is further supported by the fact that, in the sensory patch itself, the basiconic type is by far more numerous. These are very thin-walled and delicate, the entire exoskeleton, as a matter of fact, being quite thin on the whole sensory patch. Fig. 3.-Ligula of P. americana (X200). Note the hair-like exoskeletal covering and the basiconic sensilla, best seen at the tip of the paraglossa at left.</page><page sequence="38">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 639 Fig. 4.-(Above, left) Sensilla in the sensory field of the maxillary palpus of P. americana (X350).

(Below, right) Sensilla from the sensory field of the maxillary palpus of G. janus (X700).</page><page sequence="39">640 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) The sensory field at the tip of the labial palpus (Fig. 4) bears two types of sensilla also-long trichoid sensilla (about 55 /u long) and shorter trichoid sensilla (about 15 /u long) which are almost basiconic in type. The long trichoid type are the more numerous, and they are much thinner-walled and a little shorter than the other trichoids on the rest of the palpus. It is impos- sible, at present, to say whether the end-organs involved in contact chemore- ception are the long or the short trichoid type, or both. The exoskeleton on the sensory patch seems to be quite thin in this case, as in the case of the maxillary palpus. The delicate nature of the sensory patches on the labial and maxillary palpi is clearly shown by the fact that, in the preparation of whole mounts witn Diaphane, these may be drawn inward to form concave invaginationls, if the specimens are placed in high concentrations of alcohol without first being brought through gradual intermediate steps. On the ligula of the labium (Fig. 3) there are patches of a hairlike out- growth of the exoskeleton. These "hairs" do not seem to be sensilla. Mixed with this mass of "hair," however, are two kinds of sensilla-trichoid sensilla (about 140-175 u long), like those found widely distributed over the mouth- parts, and sensilla resembling those found on the tips of the labial palpi which could be called either short trichoid or long basiconic sensilla (about 20-25 ,u long). Since the latter are restricted to the regions shown by this study to be sensitive to chemicals-i.e., the tips of the glossae and paraglossae-it is prob- able that they are the end-organs. The tip of the hypopharynx is clothed with a mass of "hairs" exactly like those found on the ligula, but there seem to be no sensilla present. Trichoid, coeloconic, and basiconic sensilla are found along the lateral edges. Either one or both of the latter two types are possibly the end-organs. It seems probable, therefore, that the receptors are the basiconic sensilla, which may be long enough to resemble short trichoid types, found in the regions shown to be chemoreceptive experimentally. This view is further supported by the fact that regions of the mouth-parts other than those shown to be sensitive do not bear these organs, nor do the legs or antennae. The possibility remains that the thin-walled trichoid sensilla of the labial palpi and the coeloconic or trichoid sensilla on the hypopharynx may also serve as con- tact chemoreceptors. Blattella germanica.-The appearance and distribution of sensilla on the mouth-parts of this species are almost exactly the same as in the preceding species. The organs are about the same size, though the mouth-parts, as a whole, are smaller. Gryllus assimilis.-The sensitive regions on the tips of the palpi are clearly delimited in this species. The tips of the maxillary palpi, instead of the sides as in the roaches, bear the sensory fields. The organs found on the fields of the maxillary palpi are all of one type-basiconic sensilla (about 18 /u long) with thin walls and well developed bases (Fig. 4). Since there are no other types of sensilla present within the sensory field, it is almost certain that the basiconic sensilla are the end-organs. On the tips of the labial palpi there are</page><page sequence="40">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 641 two types of sensilla-long tricnoid (about 75 /u long) and short trichoid types (about 25 /u long). Since the shorter type is thinner-walled and more like the sensilla on the maxillary palpus, it is reasonable to assume that these are the end-organs on the labial palpus, but there is no direct evidence for this. Melanoplus difjerentialis.-The maxillary and labial palpi of the grasshop- per bear sensory fields at the tips. The only sensilla present on both the maxillary and labial palpal tips (Fig. 4) are the peg-like basiconic type (about 20 [u long). It is thus almost certain that this is the type involved in contact chemoreception. Since no sensilla other than a heavy trichoid type are pres- ent on the ligula and since the ligula has been shown not to bear receptors, the belief that the basiconic sensilla are the end-organs is given further substantia- tion. Other regions of the mouth-parts have not been studied so far. Tenodera a. sinensis.-The tips of the palpi bear only trichoid sensilla. These are distinguishable from the ordinary trichoid type found all over the palpi by being rather shorter (long type about 100-105 /u long, shorter type about 30 /u long on the maxillary palpus and about 70 [u long on the labial palpus). They also appear thinncr walled, but they cannot, by any stretching of the term, be called basiconic. There are only five or six of the shorter type on each palpus; indeed, the palpi bear relatively few sensilla of any kind. A few of the shorter trichoid type, resembling those on the palpal tips, are found also on the paraglossae and glossae, and these may be receptors on those parts, but experimental proof is lacking. Thermobia domestica.-The maxillary palpi (Fig. 2) bear only trichoid sensilla, which are seemingly the same all along their extent. The maxillary palpi, however, were found not to bear contact chemoreceptors. The tips of the labial palpi, which were found to be chemoreceptive, bear numerous thin- waIled trichoid sensilla of various lengths, and a group of five tuft-like struc- tures, the nature of which we have not determined. So far, these morphologi- cal studies have not given any clue as to the nature of the end-organs involved. Chrysopa sp.-The basiconic sensilla in sensory patches on the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi are quite small (about 5 tu long over all), but quite definitely visible. There are also present on the palpi longer trichoid sensilla (about 65 to 75 tu long), but these are wide-spread over the palpi and other regions of the mouth-parts. It seems probable that the small basiconic sen sUila, restricted to the sensory patches at the tips, are the palpat receptors involved. Libellula sp.-Since the experiments did not enable us to determine the loci of the end-organs, if any, involved in contact chemoreception, morphological studies would be without experimental roots, and none are reported. Galerita janus.-The maxillary palpus and the organs found on the sen- sory patch at its tip are shown in Fig. 4. These basiconic sensilla are about 10 y long from the base to the tip. Since no other sensilla are present on the</page><page sequence="41">642 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) sensory patch, it is certain that these are the contact chemoreceptors. Studies of other regions of the mouth-parts have not so far been made. Epicauta pennsylvanica.-On the tips of the maxillary and labial palpi are well-defined sensory fields containing only basiconic sensilla (about 10- 12 ,u long), which, therefore, are probably the contact chemoreceptors. These are quite like those of G. janus in appearance, and thus no photomicrograph is presented. Since the other loci of receptors on the mouth-parts were not deter- mined, no further morphological studies are reported. Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus.-The maxillary palpus has a sensory patch aiong the inner edge of the tip. The labial palpus has a distinct patch at the outer edge. In each case, the only type of sensillum in the patch is a basi- conic type (about 15 ju long on the maxillary palpus and about 25 /u long on the labial palpus). Around the patches are longer trichoid sensilla and these extend all over the palpus. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the basiconic type is the contact chemoreceptor in this form. This type of sensil- lum, found for G. janus, E. pennsylvanica, and C. pennsylvanicus, is the same morphologically as those found on the palpal tips by the German workers on beetles and by Valentine (1931). Crombie (1944) and McIndoo (1929) described similar organs from the palpal tips of Rhizopertha and Epilachna, and these are probably contact chemoreceptors in these forms. Tetraopes tetraophthalmus.-We have so far made no morphologic studies on this form. Oncopeltus fasciatus.-At the tip of the proboscis there is a small field of peg-like organs, each about 10 [u long, and a few delicate thin-walled trichoid sensilla, about 25 p, long. There are also present two long trichoid sensilla, about 75 ,u long. The smaller trichoid type is found all along the proboscis, Fig. 5.-Terminal segments of the fore tarsus of Pieris rapae (XI00). The fine trichoid sensilla on the ventral side may be contact chemoreceptors.</page><page sequence="42">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 643 and thus may probably be eliminated as th e chemoreceptor, since the tip of the proboscis alone seems to bear the receptors. This leaves the two long trichoid sensilla and the field of basiconic sensilla as possibilities. The resem- blance of the long trichoid type to hairs spread widely over the bodies of the insects, suggests that the true chemoreceptors are the basiconic sensilla, but direct proof is lacking. On the tarsi there are many types of sensilla, and we are unable, at present, to assign a gustatory function to any one of these. Pieris rapae.-On the proboscis of this form there are two types of sensilla -short, thin, trichoid sensilla (about 8 ,u long) distributed all along the out- side of the proboscis and also found on the inner surface of the proboscis, and very short, blunt, thin-walled pegs in pits (extending about 4 tu above the surface), restricted to the outside of the proboscis near the tip, especially numerous at the tip. Which if these may be the contact chemoreceptors, we are not prepared to say. F Fig. 6.-(Above) Portion of the ventral surface of the terminal segment of the middle tarsus of Danaus plexippus (X100). The thin-walled trichoid sensilla found among the scales and long spines may be chemoreceptive. (Below) Tip of the proboscis of D. plexip- pus (X100) showing the pit-peg (coeloconic) organs.</page><page sequence="43">644 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) On the tarsi of the fore and middle legs, along with heavy spines and long trichoid sensilIa, are shorter thin-walled sensilIa, about 40 /u long (Fig. 5) These are on the ventral sides of the tarsi on all the segments. They are present also on the hind tarsi, but very sparsely scattered, not in groups as on the fore and middle tarsi. While there is no direct evidence that these are the tarsal receptors, they are admirably suited in position and structure to be the tarsal receptors experimentally demonstrated in this form. Colias philodice.-We have prepared no slides of this form, and conse- quently report no morphological studies. Danaus plexippus.-No studies have been made of the larval parts. On thc proboscis of the adult, there are present the two types of sensilla described above for P. rapae, but the trichoid sensilla are far fewer. The peg-like organs in pits on the outside of the proboscis (Fig. 6), extend about 7 [u above the surface. The tiny hairs extend about 8[k above the surface. The pit pegs are present only at the tip and for about 400 tu back on the outside of the proboscis. The tiny hairs are not found at the tip, the first one which could be found on the outside being about 175 tu back from the tip. Inside the proboscis there are trichoid sensilla like those outside, but a little longer. The internal hairs are found in a neat line on the lateral walls about 100 ,u apart. Which of these organs may be the end-organs, it is impossible to say at present, but the fact that removal of the terminal 20 mm. of the proboscis did not destroy the ability to taste, makes it seem probable that the trichoid type is the receptor. Whether both the sensilla inside the proboscis and those outside are involved or not, these experiments do not allow us to decide. The tarsi are heavily clothed with scales and spines, and this renders a study of them difficult. There are present among the heavy spines and scales, however, thin clear hairs about 85 tu long, which are found on all the segments of the tarsi, but not elsewhere on the legs. These are shown in Fig. 6. It is possible that these may be the receptors involved in tarsal reception in this form. Eristalis sp.-On the front edge of the labella there are trichoid sensilla of three lengths which are not clearly separable (Fig. 7). One type averages about 55 to 70 tt long, the second about 35 to 40 p, long and the third about 18 , long. There is present also a pelage-like outgrowth of the exoskeleton, about 4 tt thick. At the rear of the labella, the long hairs are longer than at the front (about 85 to 100 tu long), and long tactile hairs (about 175 tu long) are also present. Between the pseudotracheae are the interpseudotracheal papillae. Since the labella were stimulated when the inner surfaces were pressed together and therefore the interpseudotracheal papillae were not ex- posed, it is obvious that one or more of the trichoid sensilla described above are contact chemoreceptors, but further differentiation is not possible at pres- ent. The tarsi are heavily clothed with trichoid sensilla and spines. We have not succeeded so far in seeing single sensilla clearly enough to postulate any possible receptors on the tarsi.</page><page sequence="44">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 645 Phormia regina.-The labella closely resemble the labella of M. domestica, shown in Fig. 8. The long hairs were shown experimentally to be tactile. Near the anterior tip they are about 180 /u long, and near the posterior tip about 300 ,u long. The shorter hairs, about 70-80 ,1 long, were found to be contact chemoreceptors. There are no other sensilla present in the regions found by local stimulation to be receptive of contact chemical stimuli. On the upper surface of the labella there are very small hairs (about 15 [u long) in small groups, but their location rules them out as having been touched by the needles in our experiments. The "pelage" on the labella is about 7 tu deep and cleary visible. It is the presence of this presumably non-sensory "pelage" that gave rise to the use of the term, "medium sized hairs" in the previous report on Tabanus (Frings and O'Neal, 1946). The interpseudotracheal papillae are about 10 ,t high. Since the labella are kept closed when at rest, the inter- pseudotracheal papillae were not touched by the needles used in the experi- ments. There is no evidence from this study that these may not be contact chemoreceptors, but at least the shorter trichoid sensilla at the rim of the Fig. 7.-(Above) Anterior tip of the labella of Eristalis sp. (X400). (Below) An- terior tip of the labella of Musca domestica (X400).</page><page sequence="45">646 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) labella are definitely such receptors. Since the blow fly possesses olfactory receptors on the labella (Frings, 1941) and since the long trichoid type have been shown to be tactile in this study while the shorter ones are contact chemo- receptors, it may not be amiss to suggest that the interpseudotracheal papillae may be the distance chemoreceptors. We have not succeeded so far in finding possible receptors on the tarsi of biow flies. Phaenicia sericata.-No studies have been made on the end-organs on the labella and tarsi of this species. Musca domestica.-The expanded labella of this species are shown in Fig. 8. The long trichoid sensilla (about 180-200 , long at the anterior margin and about 300 /u long behind) shown to be tactile are clearly visible, and lying among them the shorter trichoids (about 45-60 ,u long) which are contact cliemoreceptors. The only other possible receptors on the labella are the inter- pseudotracheal papillae. The surface of the exoskeieton is covered with the pelage-like outgrowth found in the other species of flies, about 7 ,u deep in this species. As suggested for P. regina, the interpseudotracheal papillae may not be gustatory receptors at all, but possibly olfactory, though both direct and Fig. 8.-Labella of Musca domestica (X80). The long trichoid sensilla were found to be tactile, the shorter trichoid sensilla are contact chemoreceptors.</page><page sequence="46">o~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- C=C I- .| 5 C . iHHIIIIIIII +?++?++IJ+fI ,E _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C- 4.J~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C- 4i ~ ~ ii f i S .

The tarsi have been studied histo- logically by Hayes and Liu (1947), and the thin-walled hairs found by them on the terminal four segments are easily seen in whole mounts. These thin- walled hairs are replaced on the basal segment by heavy spines, correlating well with the lack of receptive capacity on the basal segment. Polistes sp.-A photomicrograph of the labium of this species is presented in Fig. 9. This shows the organs on the tips of the labial palpi, glossae and paraglossae which are possibly the contact chemoreceptors, since these points were shown experimentally to be the loci of the end-organs. They are trichoid in type, curved at the tips, about 40 ju long on the labial palpi and the glossae and about 50 pt long on the paraglossae. Sensilla exactly like these are found on the tips of the maxillary palpi also and are there about 35 tu long. That these are the actual end-organs seems probable, since they are characteristic in size and shape, as against other trichoid sensilla on the mouth-parts, and found on the spots shown to be receptive experimentally. The tarsi and anten- nae bear a confusing array of possible end-organs, and it is impossible at present to decide which ones might be the actual contact chemoreceptors. Vespula maculata.-So far no morphological studies on this form have been made. Apis mellifera.-To return to a discussion of the possible end-organs on the eight terminal segments of the antenna of this species would be, as Forel Fig. 9.-Ligula and labial palpi of Polistes. (X100).</page><page sequence="48">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 649 (1900) says about the sense of smell in insects, "gilding refined gold." These possibilities have been discussed thoroughly by Frisch (1921), Minnich (1932), and by many workers on the morphology of the antennae of Apis. Since our experiments do not allow us to designate any particular end-organ as the one involved, we shall essay no discussion of possibilities. The fore tarsi are clothed with hairs of more than one type; which would be the recep- tors we are unable to say. Since the experiments did not determine the exact loci of the gustatory organs on the mouth-parts, no detailed description of these parts is presented. Summary of Morphological Studies.-From these studies it seems obvious that the actual end-organs on the palpal tips of the mandibulate insects are basiconic sensilla, often being long enough, however, to be classed possibly as short trichoid sensilla. The sensilla on other regions of the mouth-parts may be either basiconic, trichoid, or coeloconic. Where accurately determined, as for the palpi of the roach, cricket and grasshopper, the basiconic sensilla are definitely contact chemoreceptors. This checks well with the discoveries of previous workers on beetles. In the haustellate orders, on the other hand, the sensilla which have been shown to be the actual end-organs for contact chemoreception are definitely trichoid. These trichoid sensilla, however, are often blunt rather than pointed, and thus give some indication of having possibly been derived from a basi- conic ancestral type (cf. for instance, Oncopeltus and Eristalis). For all insects there is need for much further experimental work to deter- inine exactly the loci of contact chemoreceptors, so that morphological studies can be interpreted unequivocally. DISCUSSION To give some general over-all picture of the loci of contact chemoreceptors in the orders of insects studied herein, Table IV is presented. From this it is obvious that the most constant loci for contact chemoreceptors in all forms are the tips of the labial palpi (assuming that the labella of the Diptera actually correspond to the labial palpi). The only group in which labial palpi are present without these receptors is the Lepidoptera. The maxillary palpi, where present, also are apt to bear contact chemoreceptors. The only groups in which they were found lacking were the Thysanura and Diptera. The ligula, also, and the hypopharynx, where present, are likely to bear these receptors. Tarsal receptors are restricted to the haustellate orders, even possibly to haus- tellate stages in the life cycle of insects with mandibulate larvae, such as the Lepidoptera, or to haustellate species in orders which have both haustellate and mandibulate types, such as the Hymenoptera. Antennal receptors have been found so far only in some of the Hymenoptera, thus being quite restricted in distribution. It is worth noting that the papei by Dethier (1947) was published after these experiments were completed, and therefore the presence or absence of contact chemoreceptors on the ovipositor was not tested for. Actually the</page><page sequence="49">650 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) receptors located by our experiments are those involved in feeding reactions. It is certainly possible that contact chemoreceptors, resembling perhaps the common chemical receptors of Vertebrates, may be found on other parts of the bodies of ilsects. It is interesting to note, from Table IV, that the insects which have tarsal and antennal ceceptors are those whose habits are such as to "require" them, as Nagel (1894) postulated. Thus predaceous, omnivorous, and phytopha- gcus mandibulate forms lack these, while the flower-frequenting haustellate types have them. It would seem that Minnich's (1932) suggestion that the ancestral insect had contact chemoreceptors distributed widely on all the ap- pendages may not be true. The ancestral insect was probably mandibulate. W(hile it is, of course, impossible to state with certainty the distribution of the contact chemoreceptors in this insect type, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution would probably be most like that of recent thysanuroid or orthop- teroid insects. This would mean that the contact chemoreceptors, with the possible exception of those on the ovipositor, would be found on the palpi and other regions of the mouth-parts. The occurrence of these receptors on the antennae and tarsi of the higher insects would, therefore, seem to be a case of secondary specialization. The claim of Mclndoo (1934) that tarsal chemoreception was really tarsal tacto-olfaction has already been discussed. There is really an iimportant point at issue here. Are the distance and contact chemical senses of insects really separate? A complete discussion of this matter would lead us too far afield from the present matter, and will not be attempted. Marshall (1935b) stated that it is possible that insects have only chemoreceptors, and that these are of different sensitivities, those on the antennae being most sensitive and therefore usually acting as distance receptors, those on the mouth-parts being less sensitive and usually acting as contact receptors but sometimes as distance chemoreceptors, and those on the tarsi being least sensitive and acting only as contact receptors. The present state of our knowledge of chemosensitivity of insects does not allow us to decide this issue definitely. It may be, thus, that contact chemoreceptors, as defined in this paper, tested for by the use of com- pounds non-odorous to man, may be only one type in a galaxy of general chemoreceptors on the insect body. This method of testing, however, at least enables us to find chemoreceptors which have the common property of being stimulated by non-volatile, water-soluble substances which in higher animals stimulate gustatory receptors. The experiments of Frisch (1934), Schaller (1926), Ritter (1936), and Bauer (1938) on various insects, however, show- ing that they can distinguish the different modalities of taste by means of the receptors on the mouth-parts, strengthens our belief that the receptors thus discovered are true gustatory receptors.5 5 It will be noted that, throughout this paper, the terms, gustatory, taste, contact chemoreceptive, and tactochemical, have been used synonymously. With the present state of our knowledge in this field, these terms, if used without perceptual implications, are impossible to separate.</page><page sequence="50">1949 FRINGS ET AL.: CONTACT RECEPTORS IN INSECTS 651 From the morphological studies, it is obvious that there is no such thing as an anatomically differentiatable contact chemoreceptor. Two types of sen- sila have been shown to be contact chemoreceptors-basiconic and trichoid- and there has been shown to be a loose relationship between the type of recep- tor and the feeding habits of insects, whatever this may mean. But this separa- tion is not clear-cut, and with the further possibility that other types of sensilla may also be involved, it is clear that anatomical studies are not sufficient to prove that a particular sensillum is a contact chemoreceptor, unless backed up bv critical experiments. It may be that it will be possible, with histological methods, to distinguish between chemoreceptive and non-chemoreceptive sensilla by the absence or presence of a tenninal strand or a group of basal nerve-cells (Snodgrass, 1935). It is now possible for histological studies to be made of organs shown definitely to be contact chemoreceptors-the pegs on the palpi of the grass- hopper or cricket, for instance, or the hairs on the labella of the house fly or blow fly. These studies, backed up by experimental demonstrations of the functions of the sensilla, may enable histologists to determine the true struc- ture of a contact chemoreceptor and thus make possible histological identifica- tion with some certainty. Finally, as pointed out earlier, these experiments must be considered as only a beginning. They should indicate the future course which will give us information as to the location and nature of the contact chemorecep- tors of insects. First, there must be experimental determination of the loci of the receptors and, where possible, of the exact end-organs. Then there can follow morphological and histological studies. Such combined work should yield the raw data from which fruitful generalizations concerning the location and nature of these receptors in insects can be formulated. SUMMARY A review of the published work on the location of the contact chemorecep- tors of insects reveals that these have been found on the mouth-parts (particu- larly the palpi of mandibulate insects and the labella of flies), the tarsi of but- terflies, flies and bees, the antennae of bees, and the ovipositors of a few hymenopterous parasites. The actual end-organs on these parts are in most cases unknown, but may be thin-walled basiconic, coeloconic or trichoid sen- silla. In view of the many parts of the body which may bear these receptors and the differences in form of the suspected end-organs, morphological studies based on criteria of location or structure, without experimental support, are of little value. In the present work, 23 species from the orders, Thysanura, Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Odonata, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera were studied. The insects were mounted alive on wax blocks for exact observations, though some tests were also made with free animals. The loci of contact chemoreceptors were found by: 1. local stimulation experi- ments, in which particular organs or even sensilla were touched with fine</page><page sequence="51">652 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 41 (3) needles bearing sapid solutions, following control tests, and 2. extirpation experiments, in which organs were removed and the reactions of the animals to sapid solutions before and after the removal were observed. Nutritional and water controls were provided in all experiments. In the mandibulate insects, where loci could be determined accurately, the tips of the maxillary palpi (except for possibly the firebrat) and the labial palpi were found to bear contact chemoreceptors. The probable end-organs are either basiconic or trichoid in shape and usually found in definite sensory fields. Other receptors were found to be present on the mouth-parts in the insects tested. In two species of roaches, they were located on the hypophar- ynx and the tip of the labium (ligula). In one species of grasshopper, they were found only on the hypopharynx. In these three species there was no evi- dence that receptors existed at other places on the mouth-parts or in the mouth or pharynx. The antennae, tarsi, and cerci, where present, of mandibulate insects seem not to bear contact chemoreceptors. In the haustellate insects, tarsal chemoreceptors are present in many species. These may be only on the fore tarsi, as in the honey bee, or on all the tarsi, as in the house fly. They are generally on the four terminal tarsal segments and, in some species, on the proximal tarsal segment and even possibly the distal end of the tibia. Where the sensilla were located, they were found to be thin-walled and trichoid in type. Antennal receptors were found only in the honey bee and the Polistes wasp, of the species tested. In. the bee, they are on the eight terminal segments of the antenna, and in the wasp on all segments except the basal one. The antennal end-organs were not determined. The receptors on the mouth-parts of haustellate insects are usually at or near the tip of the proboscis. These were located accurately in certain Diptera, and were found to be trichoid in type. In the species of Diptera where all the end-organs were probably located, the tarsal and labellar receptors were the only ones found. Neither the experimental nor the morphological studies made so far allow unequivocal generalizations with respect to either position or structure of the contact chemoreceptors of insects. Differences in the loci and appearance have been found even in insects from the same order, such as the roach and the grasshopper. The differences among insects in the distribution and structure of contact chemoreceptors seem to be related to food habits, but the relation- ships are obscure at present. Much further experimental work is necessary, followed by morphological and histological studies of organs shown experi- mentally to be contact chemoreceptors, before fruitful generalizations will be possible.
