<plain_text><page sequence="1">When Does Translation Become Exegesis? Exodus 24:9-1 1 in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint ERIC JOHN WYCKOFF, S.D.B. Studium Theologicum Salesianum Jerusalem 91072, Israel Emanuel Tov has written that exegesis motivated by theological concerns is practically unavoidable in any translation of a work dealing with a deity or deities.1 Even a translation of Homer must take positions in matters relating to the world of the gods that he describes. In the LXX, such exegesis can take the form of addi- tions and omissions in the text or changes in grammar or vocabulary by which the theological world of ancient scribes and/or translators has become embedded in the biblical text.2 In the closing scene of the Sinai narrative, Moses and a group of priests and elders experience a visio Dei and eat and drink on the mountaintop (Exod 24:9-1 1). The MT indicates twice that they actually "see God" (vv. 10, 11), with no further explanation. Along with several other departures from a strictly literal translation, the LXX reports instead that they see God's "place." How did these variations find their way into the Greek, and which among them constitute theological exegesis embedded in the text? What concerns do they reflect, and by what criteria could they have been justified? Do they modify the passage's literary function and the- ological claims? In the present article, I seek to answer these questions and to offer For their invaluable feedback and suggestions, I sincerely thank Jean Louis Ska, S.J., and the anonymous CBQ reviewers; I accept sole responsibility for all remaining flaws. 1 Emanuel Tov, "Theologically Motivated Exegesis Embedded in the Septuagint," in idem, The Greek and Hebrew Bible: Collected Essays on the Septuagint (VTSup 72; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 257-69, esp. 257. 2 1 use "LXX" as convenient shorthand for the Old Greek version. 675</page><page sequence="2">676 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QU ARTERLY | 74,2012 one example of how language, context, and theology played a role in the trans- mission of the sacred text. I. Methodological Considerations Recent scholarly discussion of theological exegesis in the LXX has in great part been divided between "maximalists," who see such exegesis as a conscious and systematic practice in the translation process (e.g., Joachim Schaper and Martin Rosei), and "minimalists," who tend to attribute disagreements between the MT and the LXX to linguistic matters or to textual variants in the Hebrew Vor- lage (e.g., Anneli Aejmelaeus, Raija Sollamo, and other members of the "Helsinki school").3 Other scholars such as Albert Pietersma, Johann Cook, and Jan Joosten have advocated steering a middle course by examining potential theological changes according to a scientific analysis of the text's translation character rather than Tendenzkritik .4 Joosten observes, "When a divergence is observed between the Hebrew source text and its Greek translation, theologians are tempted to attrib- ute it to theological reasons before envisaging any other type of explanation. This is poor method. The theological interpretation should not be the first one we reach for, but the last one, when more down-to-earth explanations fail."5 In order, therefore, to distinguish genuine theological exegesis embedded in Exod 24:9-11 from modifications introduced for more mundane reasons, 1 will apply Tov's criteria for classifying conscious emendations in the LXX into four categories: linguistic exegesis, contextual exegesis, theological exegesis, and 3 Joachim Schaper, Eschatology in the Greek Psalter (WUNT 2/76; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1995) esp. 16-30; Martin Rosei, "Towards a Theology of the Septuagint," in Septuagint Research : Issues and Challenges in the Study of the Greek Jewish Scriptures (ed.

These choices are considered exegesis because they involve an interpretation of the text, but if it cannot be demonstrated that they were motivated by theology or conces- sions to the contemporary context of the LXX, this exegesis is simply linguistic. Other variants seem to have arisen out of concerns about the translation's comprehensibility to its intended listeners and readers. Tov calls this second cate- gory "contextual exegesis."8 Not all Hebrew idioms made sense when translated word for word into Greek, and the translator sometimes opted to render these according to their meaning by adding or omitting words or by paraphrasing. This, too, is exegesis because it involves an interpretation of the Hebrew phrase's mean- ing, but it is contextual because its primary criterion is the context in which the LXX was meant to be used. Theological exegesis is the third classification. It can be defined as any the- ological element that has been intentionally introduced, accentuated, modified, attenuated, or eliminated in relation to its source text for reasons that demonstrably go beyond linguistic or contextual exegesis. As Tov writes, "Theological exegesis may relate to the description of God and his acts, the Messiah, Zion, the exile, as well as various ideas, such as that of repentance. Such exegesis may be expressed through theologically motivated choices of translation equivalents, in changes in words and verses (either slight or great) or in expansions or omissions of ideas considered offensive."9 Unlike the previous two categories, which are by definition linked to the translation process, these elements may have been incorporated during translation or art some point in the textual history of the Vorlage .10 Tov identifies examples of theological exegesis in the MT, the Samaritan Pentateuch and various Qumran scrolls, as well as in the LXX and other ancient translations, dividing them into the subcategories of antipolytheistic alterations, harmonizations with the surrounding text, euphemisms, modifications to conform to Torah commands, and the toning down of potentially offensive elements.11 6 Emanuel Tov, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2nd ed.; Minneapolis: Fortress, 2001 ) 124-28; see also idem, The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (2nd ed.; Jerusalem Biblical Studies 8; Jerusalem: Simor, 1997) 45-50. 7 Tov, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible , 124-25. 8 Ibid., 125-27; see also idem, "Theologically Motivated Exegesis," 260-69. 9 Tov, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible, 127. 10 Ibid., 262. 11 Ibid., 264-75.</page><page sequence="4">678 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QU ARTERLY | 74,2012 Tov's final category comprises embedded exegesis similar in style and func- tion to the midrash of later rabbinic literature. "By definition such midrashic ele- ments add a dimension to the plain meaning of Scripture." Though most common in the Aramaic targums, this type of exegesis can also be found in the LXX and the Vg.12 Like theological exegesis, to which it is closely related, this type of exe- gesis could theoretically have originated in translation or the Vorlage. Some basic facts about the LXX as a translation must underlie the application of Tov's criteria. In the first place, manuscript evidence leaves no doubt that a number of Hebrew texts were in circulation in the period before the turn of the era. Unfortunately, no fragment from the Judean desert preserves Exod 24:9-11, nor has any "proto-LXX" Hebrew textual witness for these verses ever been recov- ered anywhere. Therefore, rather than building an argument dependent on a hypo- thetical reconstruction of the Vorlage, I will employ the MT as a concrete point of comparison with LXX Exodus and the largely unknown textual tradition behind it. Second, the books of the LXX were not all translated in the same time and place as part of the same project, and much about their origins remains unclear. For this reason, the text of these verses will be analyzed primarily according to evidence from within LXX Exodus itself. II. The Text The first step in responding to the questions posed here about Exod 24:9-1 1 is to identify the elements in the MT and the LXX that do not correspond to one another literally. The table on the following page presents the two readings in par- allel, with the points of divergence underlined.13 The table illustrates that the read- ings differ on eight points: 1 . The plural MpT ("elders") in the MT is translated by the collective noun yepouaia ("council of elders") in the LXX (v. 9b). 2. In the MT, Moses and the others see the God of Israel, while a plus text in the LXX indicates that they only see "the place where the God of Israel stood" (v. 10a). 3. The relative pronoun tú in the LXX has no direct counterpart in the MT (v. 10b). 4. What is under God's feet is "like the sky itself' in the MT, while in the LXX it is "like the appearance of the firmament of the sky" (v. 10b).14 12 Ibid., 128. 13 The Hebrew text is taken from BHS' the Greek is from John William Wevers and Udo Quast, eds., Exodus (Septuaginta: Vetus Testamentům Graecum Auctoritate Academiae Scientiarum Gottingensis editum 2. 1 ; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1991 ) 278-79. Here and throughout the present article, my own literal English translation of the biblical text is used. 14 Regarding the MT's use in v. 10 of DX57 (literally "bone"), see Paul Joüon and Takamitsu</page><page sequence="5">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 679 Table 1 MT LXX pnxi nrâ 9Kal aveßq Miūuoiļc; Kal Aapòv XirPSXI 373 Kal Naöaß Kal Äßiouö *?X-|W'' Kal ¿ßöopr)KOVTa rfjc; ;y££oyaig£'Iapar)' 1 XT'! 10 10Kal eïôov Vx-lfr1 Tï^K nx TÒv TÓ7IQV. ou eloTiļKei ekeī ó 0eòç Toö'IapariX' nnm Kai tà ùnò toùç nóòac; aÙToù tdoh ran1? rtoQS iogeI Ěpyov 7tXív0ou oa^Eípou, D'ötfn DXVDI Kal ¿üGTTEp eIôoc GTspEcbpatoc toū oùpavoù nnü1?

Israelites he did not raise his hand: not one perished: they beheld God, they appeared in the place of God, and they ate and drank, and they ate and drank. 5. The lexeme ^SX is rare in the MT, and only in this verse has it been con- strued to mean "chief' or "noble." The LXX renders it as E7TÍXekto&lt;;, "cho- sen" (v. 11a).15 6. Both texts describe how all those present live, despite their proximity to God. The MT says that God "did not send his hand against them," using Muraoka, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew (rev. Eng. ed.; Subsidia Biblica 27; Rome: Pontifical Bib- lical Institute, 2006) §147a. 1 5 BDB, 69; HALOT, 1:81; John William Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus (SBLSCS 30; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990) 385.</page><page sequence="6">680 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QU ARTERLY | 74,2012 a well-known turn of phrase, while the LXX makes use of a paraphrase, "not one perished" (v. 1 la). 7. As they eat and drink, Moses and the others actually look upon God in the MT, but in the LXX they "appear" (c^Oqaav), indicating that IT m must have been read as niphal instead of qal (v. lib). 8. In the same phrase, a plus text in the LXX specifies that they appear "in the place of' God (v. 1 lb). Three minor points are not included in this discussion because they represent frequently encountered phenomena with negligible grammatical or theological impact. Personal names are often rendered differently in the LXX than in the MT, as in the case of Abihu (NIPPON) versus Abioud ('AßiouS) in v. 9b. This simply reflects diversity in how the ancients pronounced and transcribed Hebrew and Greek.16 There are also countless discrepancies in the presence or absence of the conjunction "and" as denoted by the Greek xai or the Hebrew 1, such as between the names of Aaron and Nadab in v. 9b. These may have originated either in the Vorlage or in the translation process as the result of scribal error or conscious lit- erary preference.17 Similarly, the variation between "Israelites" or "sons of Israel" (^tCliZT ^3) and "Israel" (laparjX) in v. 11a may represent an accidental omission of the word ^2 ("sons") or a stylistic choice to harmonize with two nearby occur- rences of "of Israel" (vv. 4, 1 1) on the part of either the Greek translator or a pre- vious Hebrew copyist. III. Analysis of the Points of Divergence The next task is to analyze each of the eight variations from a linguistic stand- point, classify them according to Tov's criteria, and weigh possible explanations for their origin. All are treated as conscious decisions, since none can be explained by accidental scribal errors such as haplography, dittography, parablepsis, and the like. They are grouped according to the literary nature of the change: lexical choice, paraphrase, Hebrew interpretation, and expansion of the text. A. Lexical Choices Points 1, 4, and 5 derive from lexical choices. None presents evidence sug- gesting a variant in the Vorlage, so it can be assumed that these represent choices made by the translator. In point 1 (v. 9b), the elders 03pT) of Israel are designated by the collective noun yepouoia, as they are in Exod 3:16, 18; 4:29; and 12:21. In 16 See Toy, Text-Critical LJse of the Septuagint, 136. 17 Ibid., 157-58.</page><page sequence="7">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 68 1 two nearby references to the same group of seventy (24:1, 14), however, ^pT is translated by Ttpeaßirrepoc; (its direct lexical equivalent) in the plural, as also in Exod 17:5; 18:12; and 19:7. Thus, the instances are evenly split. There appears to be no differentiation in the use of these two lexemes in LXX Exodus, so according to Tov's categorization, this is nothing more than linguistic exegesis. The word DXy in point 4 (v. 10b) literally means "bone" but reflects a partic- ular usage in Hebrew. It carries a reflexive force, which gives emphasis to the noun that follows, in this case meaning "the sky itself' or "the heavens themselves."18 The Greek translation, eîôoç aTepeúpaToç, is something quite different, meaning "the appearance of the firmament." John William Wevers considers this a conscious effort to clarify for the reader that v. 10 is referring to the sky and not heaven.19 Although this would be consistent with a tendency of LXX Exodus to expand and clarify, it is not the only explanation.20 The verse is speaking about what the bricks under God's feet look like, so elôoç is not entirely out of place to describe what they "saw" (eíôov, v. 10a). It is also possible that the grammatical use of DXtf was not clear to the translator. Out of four instances of this usage in LXX Exodus (12:17, 41, 51; 24:10), not one is translated in a way that accurately reflects the original, raising doubt as to whether the idiom was correctly understood.21 The translator may have taken it to mean something hard that gives structure like human bone, which with reference to the sky could only mean the firmament. Wevers 's suggestion is plausible, but it cannot be proven that this is anything more than an attempt at making sense of a Hebrew idiom with an unobvious meaning, and hence linguistic and/or contextual exegesis according to Tov's classifications. Point 5 (v. 11a) represents the sole use of V'SX in this sense in the entire MT.22 Modern léxica use comparisons from Arabic to place it in the semantic field of nobility, hence translations such as "nobles" or "chiefs." The choice of èníAeicToc; 18 Joüon and Muraoka, §147a. This use of DXH later becomes the normal way of expressing the reflexive pronoun in Mishnaic Hebrew. 19 Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus, 385. 20 For further explanation and examples of this tendency in LXX Exodus, see John William Wevers, Text History of the Greek Exodus (Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen: Philologisch-Historische Klasse 3.192; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1992) 148. 21 In 12:17, 41, 51, DXy appears in the phrase "on that very day" (ntn DVn DXSn). In 12:17, 5 1 the emphasis added by GXy is not evident in the LXX (respectively, èv [ydp] tp řjfiépqi raÚTfj, and év tfj i^pépçi émvr|), while in 12:41 the entire phrase is left untranslated. Compare these exam- ples with Lev 23: 14, where "until that very day" (nm GITI GXy~iy) is translated literally (presumably by a different scribe) as êtoç eie; aťrrrjv rjpépav Tairrrļv. On the other hand, LXX Exodus translates the root G^y correctly when used as the noun "bone" ( 1 2:46; 13:1 9ab) or the verb "to be numerous" (1:17, 20). 22 This Hebrew lexeme appears four other times in the MT, where it is taken to mean "corner" (Isa 41 : 19) or "joint" (Jer 38:12 and Ezek 13:18 in the anatomical sense, and Ezek 41:8 in an archi- tectural sense). See BDB, 69; HALOT , 1:81.</page><page sequence="8">682 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 74,2012 ("chosen") moves to a different semantic field, but it still conveys the elite nature of the group of three priests and seventy elders accompanying Moses. It cannot be known whether this Hebrew word presented the ancient translator with difficulties akin to those encountered by modern scholars. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to propose any theological motive for this choice, and point 5 is best categorized as linguistic exegesis. B. Paraphrase The only paraphrase in Exod 24:9-1 1 occurs in point 6 (v. 11a), where in the MT the understood subject of the verb is God, who "against the chiefs of the Israelites he did not send his hand." The LXX says that "of the chosen of Israel, not one perished" (où ôi£9&lt;óvr|a£v oùôè eie;), correctly interpreting the Hebrew expression but changing the grammatical subject of the clause. Unfortunately for comparison's sake, T is not to be found anywhere else in MT Exodus in the sense of raising one's hand against persons to do them harm.23 Outside of this verse, T n*7W appears in 22:7, 10 (Eng. 22:8, 11) but with a different preposition (3, "in" or "into"), meaning to lay one's hand on something in the sense of stealing or coveting it. In the LXX Pentateuch, there is only one other occurrence of the Greek verb ôiacptovéio ("to be missing" or "to perish"): Table 2 MT LXX Num tzř»N UBO *7pD3 řól Kai où ôia7t£(pcí)vr|K£v aiť aÙTcov oùÔè £Îç 3 1 :49b And not a man among And not one among them has perished us is missing As the table shows, the Greek of Num 3 1 :49b differs from Exod 24: 1 la only in its use of the perfect tense rather than the aorist. It is therefore theoretically possible that point 6 represents a Vorlage akin to UŤN ìpD3 N*7 as in Num 3 1 :49b, but the fact remains that the Greek accurately communicates the meaning of the MT read- ing while avoiding a Hebraism, as do other paraphrases in LXX Exodus.24 23 In two other occurrences in the MT (Gen 22: 1 2; 2 Sam 18:12), the LXX renders the Hebrew literally or semiliterally. Elsewhere in the MT similar turns of phrase occur, but with a different verb or preposition (e.g., 1 Sam 22:17; 24:7, 11 [Eng. 24:6, 10]; 26:23; Isa 19:16; 49:22; Zech 13:7). Here also the LXX translates literally or semiliterally. 24 These include "uncircumcised of lips1' (DTlDitf Vii?) being rendered as "lacking in word" (aXoyoc;) in 6:12 and "weak-voiced" or "speech impeded" (ìoxvó&lt;po)voc;) in 6:30, and "they asked each other of their welfare" (insnVtthN in 1 8:7 appearing in Greek as "they greeted one another" (kqí i1a7ráoavio àXÀr|Àou&lt;;). See Tov, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible, 126.</page><page sequence="9">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 683 The next logical question is why the translator would have chosen to para- phrase instead of rendering literally. Wevers sees this as an effort to avoid making God the subject of fatally violent action - and hence theological exegesis.25 This conclusion is difficult to sustain, however, in light of the fact that V TÒVÌ is para- phrased also in the other two times it occurs in LXX Exodus (as nenoví] peuaOat, "to act wickedly"). In order to avoid confusion, the translator may simply have chosen to paraphrase all three occurrences of a Hebrew expression that had dif- ferent meanings when used with different prepositions. In the case of 24: 11a, this was done in biblical language consciously or unconsciously patterned on that of Num 3 1 :49b.26 If theology played a role in the textual history of point 6, it cannot be proven from evidence in the text. The LXX reading is best explained as a para- phrase adopted by the translator to aid the comprehension of listeners and readers, therefore an example of contextual exegesis.27 C. Hebrew Interpretation Point 7 (v. lib) reads DVlbKnTlX ITITI in the MT. The verb ITITI is vocalized as qal, and modern translations render it accordingly as "they beheld God" ( NRSV, NJPSV) or similarly. The LXX instead reads Kal &lt;ïxp0r|aav ("they were seen" or "they appeared"), which could only mean that the ancient translator interpreted ITITI in the unvocalized text as niphal. This raises suspicions, since not only is the LXX reading connected with a plus text (to be examined below), but the root HTn is unattested in the niphal in the entire MT.28 The normal way of expressing "appear" in MT Exodus is the niphal of HiCl, which the LXX also usually translates with passive forms of ópáco ("to see").29 It is not uncommon for the LXX to render active Hebrew verbs as passive and vice versa.30 In this case, however, a theological element is at stake. Even in the MT, some occurrences of ¡HO seem to be forms originally intended as qal ("to see") but later vocalized as niphal ("to appear") to attenuate the idea of humans seeing God.31 Point 7 not only tones down the idea of seeing God, but also avoids 25 Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus, 385. 26 The verb ôiecpcíw10Ev may also have been suggested by (point 5) because another meaning of the Hebrew root *7XN is to take or be taken away, as noted by Tov ("The Rabbinic Tra- dition Concerning the 'Alterations' Inserted into the Greek Translation of the Torah and Their Rela- tion to the Original Text of the Septuagint," in idem, Greek and Hebrew Bible, 14). 27 For an argument in favor of origin in the Vorlage, see Daniel O. McClellan, "Anti- Anthropomorphism and the Vorlage of LXX Exodus" (master's thesis, Oxford, 2010; available online, http://dl.dropbox.eom/u/6259597/Master%27s%20Thesis.pdf [accessed July 21, 201 1]) 27-28. 28 BDB, 302; HALOT, 1:301. 29 See 3:2, 16; 4:1, 5; 6:3; 13:7; 16:10; 23:15, 17; 34:3,20, 23,24. 30 For examples, see Tov, Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint. 1 60-61 . 31 Tov (Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible, 274-75) limits these to Ps 42:3 and Isa 1:12; other scholars include more examples. For a more detailed discussion, see Carmel McCarthy, The</page><page sequence="10">684 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 74,2012 any possible contradiction with Torah commands and harmonizes 24:1 lb with its literary context. Earlier in the Sinai narrative, Moses is told that he must warn the people not to try to look (HřCl) at God, or else many will perish (19:21). After the Decalogue, the people themselves ask Moses to be their mediator rather than listen directly to God, lest they die (20:19). In 33:18-20, when Moses boldly asks God to show him God's glory (TnDTlR KJ "'JKin), the response is clear: "You cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live" ("^KT"^ "O ^JSTIK TIR"!1? R*7 TEI DìKn). This last command is subsequently repeated in 33:23b. Thus, the LXX reading in point 7 resolves three theological issues, placing it squarely in the cat- egory of theological exegesis. Interpreting ITm as niphal in an unvocalized manuscript may have been the translator's innovation, or it may reflect a scribal tradition that already existed. Tov refers to a category of changes in the LXX that are neither text-critical "vari- ants" from the Hebrew Vorlage nor "non-variants" produced by the translation process. He calls them "pseudo-variants" in that they reflect readings or interpre- tations of the Vorlage that existed in the translator's mind rather than in written form.32 Taking into consideration that point 7 represents a tendency found even in the MT, it is at least possible if not probable that it is a pseudo-variant in which the translator was faithful to an interpretation of the Hebrew that was customary at the time. D. Expansion Points 2, 3, and 8 indicate three instances in Exod 24:9-11 where the LXX contains plus texts in comparison to the MT. Two of these, points 2 and 8 (vv. 10a, lib), surface frequently in discussions of theological exegesis in the LXX and are widely regarded as such.33 Israel's leaders see God's "place" (tóttoc;) rather than God in point 2, while in point 8 they appear in God's "place" instead of gazing upon the deity. These instances clearly constitute theological exegesis in that the idea of seeing God is considerably attenuated in v. 10 and eliminated altogether from v. 1 1, avoiding a contradiction of the Torah command in 33:20 and harmo- nizing 24:9-1 1 with its literary context. Tiqqune Sopherim and Other Theological Corrections in the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament (OBO 36; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1981 ) 197-204. Exodus includes one possible case in 34:24, where the text reads "prfrx mrp "»39 JïliTi1?. In the qal, this would be "to see the face of Yhwh your God," but the MT vocalizes it as niphal, "to appear before Yhwh your God."

Albert Pietersma</page><page sequence="11">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 685 A text-critical analysis confirms that points 2 and 8 are secondary expansions of the original. In Hebrew, the two references to seeing God read abruptly and seem rather unnuanced, given the import of their content. Yet there are no problems of syntax or narrative flow; they are sound independent clauses. The problem they raise is that they seem to contradict the divine command in 33:20, as noted in the discussion of point 7 above. The LXX reading is also grammatically sound, but its plus texts correspond precisely to the problematic phrases in the MT. The LXX presents no contradictions regarding seeing God, but this is due to the longer cir- cumlocutions it adopts. Traditional text-critical criteria point out that the scribal retouching of a passage will by nature often produce a reading that is longer and/or less problematic.34 Thus, internal literary criteria favor the MT reading as being prior because it is the shorter and the more difficult of the two. This conclusion is supported by external evidence: other ancient witnesses nuance the references to seeing God, which confirms that the text was perceived as problematic, but their solutions differ from that of the LXX.35 Why, though, was the word tcmoq ("place") introduced into the text when no element in the MT could have conceivably been taken for its Hebrew counterpart □Ipft? One explanation would be that the scribe or translator responsible for these insertions believed God to be invisible, and hence all that could be seen was the place where God was - but there is no way to prove that from the text. A more plausible solution is suggested by other examples in Exodus where LXX expan- sions preserve the distance between God and humans (see table 3 on the following page).36 The modifications that are shown in the table have been made with a cer- and Benjamin G.

The preference for the more difficult reading (lectio difficilior praeferenda/praevelet/praestat) and for the shorter reading ( lectio brevior/brevis potior ) seems to hold true here. It is entirely plausible that an ancient scribe would be willing to sacrifice some literary smoothness in order to remove a contradiction to a divine com- mand, while the reverse process would be difficult to imagine. 35 Aquila, the Vg, and the Peshitta all follow the MT. Some manuscripts of the Samaritan Pen- tateuch read ITntn instead of um in v. lib, hence, "they held fast to God" instead of "they beheld God." Symmachus reports that in v. 10a Moses and the others see God "in a vision" (ópápaTi), while Targum Neofiti I, Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, and Targum Onkelos state in both verses that the group sees God's "majesty" (*V). No evidence from Qumran is applicable here, since no fragments preserve these verses.

The expansions are as small as possible - a single noun - and they introduce lexemes already attested many times in Exodus.37 The insertion of "place" into 24: 10a, 1 lb would seem to follow similar crite- ria. Just a few words are added, and Dlpö occurs nine times in Exodus.38 One of these occurrences is in 33:21, immediately after the prohibition in 33:20 about being able to see God and live. God says to Moses, "Behold, there is a place near me" (TIN Dlpö run). If the purpose of the expansions in points 2 and 8 is to avoid contradicting 33:20, then the very next verse provides a God-given solution: do not look at God, but at the place near God, the place where God is. Following this line of reasoning, the direct object marker DN in 24: 10a, 1 lb could have been read like the preposition fiN in 33:21, meaning "near," "with," or "beside." This rather forced reading would mean that Israel's leaders obeyed the divine command in 33:20-21 to look not at God but at the place near God. They "saw (what was) near the God of Israel" (24:10a) and "appeared beside God" (v. lib). The narrative discourse in this passage can be construed to support this, since v. 10 describes only what is under God's feet, that is, the place where God is standing. The divine appearance is not depicted for the reader. This was apparently taken to mean that the group did not dare raise their eyes and thus saw only what was near God (v. 10a) or beneath God's feet (v. 10b), an interpretation that is not without logic.

While this could be taken as evidence of an origin in the Vorlage, it may simply show that a phrase from Gen 19:27 was interpolated into this verse at some point:40 Table 4 MT LXX □pan npnn Drrnx dduh u&gt;p6iaev ôè Aßpaap tò Ttpan eiç ròv Qen mm nx dw nay mffx tótiov ou slcrnÍKei èvavríov xupíou 1 9:27 And Abraham started off And Abraham started off early in early in the morning toward morning toward the place where he the place where he stood stood before the Lord, before Yhwh. The Hebrew of Gen 19:27 matches the retroversion of point 2 word for word, while the Greek avoids the Hebraism by not translating ("there") with èxel. This suggests that the interpolation into Exod 24:10a was made either from the Hebrew text or with the Hebrew in mind, but it offers no clues to whether it took place in the Vorlage or during translation. Although point 7 (treated above under "Hebrew interpretation") and point 8 both occur in v. lib, they may represent two separate modifications. The clause reads coherently with the reinterpretation only ("and they appeared beside God") or the expansion only ("and they gazed upon the place of God"). It is more likely that point 2, rather than point 7, was expanded at the same time as point 8, since both introduce "place." This may have taken place already in the Vorlage, but the evidence weighs slightly in favor of an origin in translation. Not only is there no external evidence of a Hebrew variant, but both points could conceivably pass as paraphrases of the Hebrew, especially if JIN was read as "beside" and the narrative discourse was construed as outlined above. Like the paraphrase in point 6, these expansions seem to be patterned on another pentateuchal verse, and, like the Hebrew interpretation in point 7, they seem to follow a rather forced reading of the Hebrew that may have already been in vogue. Point 3 (v. 10b), on the other hand, is probably a result of points 2 and 8. In this tiny expansion, the neuter plural form of the relative pronoun (tá) appears in the Greek although there is no corresponding element in the Hebrew such as 40 Such an argument in favor of point 2's origin in the Vorlage is advanced by McClellan ("Anti-Anthropomorphism," 26-27), who analyzes the Hebraism citing Bénédicte Lemmelijn ("Free and Yet Faithful: On the Translation Technique of LXX Exod 7:14-1 1:10," JNSL 33 [2007] 1-32, here 8) and Tov ( Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint, 84) on the retroversion of syntactical Hebraisms.</page><page sequence="14">688 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 74,2012 JIN, which LXX Exodus renders using the relative pronoun in 16:5 and 33:19ab.41 The result is that, instead of seeing beneath God's feet (MT), Moses and the others see "that which was beneath his feet" (LXX). This slight nuance removes any possibility that part of God was seen, and also functions together with points 2 and 8 to make God's place and not God the visual reference in these verses. Consequently, point 3 can be considered this passage's fourth demonstrable example of theological exegesis. While its Vorlage may have included "IttfN TIN or something similar, it is more easily explained as a consequence of points 2 and 8 in translation. If 24:9-1 1 was read as a passage about God's place, it is natural that the translator would understand "beneath his feet" as a reference to that place and make the motif present by using the relative pronoun tcl IV. Literary Function and Theological Claims A close examination of the text of Exod 24:9-1 1 has revealed that among eight points where the LXX differs from the MT, four are demonstrable examples of embedded theological exegesis. Points 2, 3, 7, and 8 tone down the idea of see- ing God, avoid the contradiction of a Torah command, and harmonize these verses with their context. But what effect do these changes have on the passage as a whole? The next task is to compare the MT and LXX readings in terms of their literary function in Exodus and the theological claims they make. A. Function and Theology in the Masoretic Text Critical scholarship on the Hebrew text of Exod 24:9-11 has traditionally identified three possible literary functions: as an encounter and meal that solemnly conclude the covenant (cf. Gen 26:26-30; 3 1 :44-54), as a cultic action culminating in a banquet (cf. Exod 18:12; Deut 12:7, 18; 14:26; 27:7), or as an occasion when humans survive an encounter with God and share a meal in the divine presence (cf. Gen 16:13; 32:31 [Eng. 32:30]; Exod3:6).42 41 An expansion similar to point 3 occurs in 33:23a, where the MT reads, "And I will remove my hand, and you will see my back" ("nnNTlN rPřCn ""MVIN Tnom). The LXX inserts xá, so that it reads, "And I will remove my hand, and then you will see what is behind me" (kcù àcpeXd) xqv x£ĪPa Kal tòte ovļ/rļ xà òtiíoco pou), employing a somewhat forced reading of "HIIN as the preposition "behind" ("lnN) plus an objective suffix instead of the noun "back" (Tinx) plus a possessive suffix. 42 See Jean Louis Ska, "Vision and Meal in Exodus 24: 1 1 ," in idem, The Exegesis of the Pen- tateuch: Exegetical Studies and Basic Questions (FAT 66; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2009) 165-83, esp. 165-70. A notable proponent of the "covenant meal" interpretation is Brevard S. Childs (The Book of Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster John Knox, 2004] 507-8). The "cultic meal" proposal has been advanced by, among others, Erhard Blum (Stu- dien zur Komposition des Pentateuch [BZAW 189; Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1990] 53) and Bernard Renaud (La théophanie du Sinaï: Ex 19-24. Exégèse et théologie [CahRB 30; Paris:</page><page sequence="15">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 689 Jean Louis Ska points out that a number of objections can be raised to each of these suggestions.43 As regards a covenant meal, the word "covenant" (IVO) does not appear in the text, nor does the meal take place immediately upon the conclusion of the covenant terms at the foot of the mountain in 24:8. The pre- requisite sacrifice is present only in material generally identified as belonging to another redactional stratum (vv. 3-8), and neither God nor the people participate in the eating and drinking in v. 11, which is limited to a select group.44 Similar objections can be raised against the cultic motif. The cultic meals cited above involve partaking in sacrifices that have just been offered, but in Exodus 24 the meal on the top of the mountain in vv. 9- 1 1 seems to be literarily independent of the sacrifice at the bottom of the mountain in v. 5, as mentioned. Finally, the sug- gestion about surviving in God's presence depends on a parallelism between seeing God and not perishing, on one hand, and contemplating God while eating and drinking, on the other, which leaves no purpose for the other elements in vv. 9-11. The reaction of fear and surprise that one would expect (as in the cases of Hagar, Jacob, and Moses in the passages cited above) is also conspicuously absent. Ska identifies another way to look at this passage's function: "In Exod 24:9- 1 1, the 'vision of God' and the 'meal' in the presence of the divinity confirm and legitimate the authority of the priests and elders, the two groups who are respon- sible for the community."45 In these verses, "seeing" and "eating with" God are the two elements that confer the right to exercise authority in God's name. Earlier in Exodus, the fact that God has appeared to Moses is what legitimates his mission to the Israelites (3:16) and to Pharaoh (4:1). This evokes the prophetic tradition, in which the prophet's credentials are typically established in an inaugural vision and the prophet's access to God is characterized by the same two verbs for "seeing" that are used in Exod 24:10a, lib (HN""1 and HTn).46 Sharing a meal in the divine Gabalda, 1 99 1 ] 1 77). "Surviving and eating" has been developed by Ernest W. Nicholson (God and His People: Covenant and Theology in the Old Testament [Oxford: Clarendon, 1986] 131-32; and idem, "The Origin of the Tradition in Exodus XXIV 9-11," K726[1976] 148-60, esp. 149-50). 43 Ska, "Vision and Meal," 165-70. See also Lothar Perlitt, Bundestheologie im Alten Testa- ment (WM ANT 36; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1969) 187-88. 44 Verses 3-8 interrupt the logical sequence of the narrative. God commands Moses to climb the mountain with the priests and elders in order to worship God (w.1-2); this is carried out (v. 9), resulting in the vision and meal (vv. 10-11). Verses 3-8 treat another matter entirely, involving dif- ferent characters and making no mention of the order given in w. 1 -2 or of the group to which it was directed. A great deal of activity takes place during w. 3-8, including at least one overnight (v. 4), introducing an incongruous delay in the execution of a divine command.

Pascal Dominique; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006) 228. 46 Isaiah (Isa 6:1-13) and Micaiah son of Imlah ( 1 Kgs 22: 1 9-22) invoke their inaugural visions as proof of prophetic authority; see Ska, "Vision and Meal," 1 70-72.</page><page sequence="16">690 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 74,2012 presence, on the other hand, evokes royal imagery, in which the privilege of "eating from the king's table" confers power and prestige while exacting the utmost loy- alty.47 Taken together, the motifs of "seeing" and "eating with" God set this episode apart as a unique and unrepeatable experience from Israel's distant formative era, endowing priests and elders with a singular authority. This last proposal best explains the content of these verses and situates Exod 24:9-1 1 among other OT passages where God designates leaders by inviting them to draw near.48 Yhwh designates a ruler in Jer 30:21 (37:21 LXX) by bringing him near, since no one would dare approach otherwise. Isaiah 24:23 proclaims that the divine glory will be revealed to God's elders. In the prophet's vision in Zech 3:7, Joshua the high priest is given the right not only to rule the temple and watch over its courtyards, but even to walk among the angels who attend God. The MT reading of Exod 24:9-11 also carries with it certain theological claims. God provides leaders for Israel in the form of a governing body that traces its origin to the seminal Sinai experience. These verses bring together several of Israel's core institutions: law and covenant (by the presence of Moses), cult and priesthood (by the presence of Aaron and his sons), the elders of the people (by the presence of the seventy), and prophecy (by their "seeing" God, HNI and ntn).49 Moses is upheld as a legitimizing authority of the highest order, and the Sinai covenant as fundamental and normative. Priests and elders discharge offices that are divinely instituted. Their depiction together as a single body implies commun- ion and coresponsibility, which in turn manifests the complementarity between the diverse theological traditions they evoke. B. Function and Theology in the Septuagint Any discussion of literary function and theological claims in the LXX read- ing of Exod 24:9-1 1 must begin with the recognition that these aspects are sub- ordinated to an overriding concern regarding the ambiguities and contradictions in the text. Seeing God, or even just God's feet, contradicts the divine pronounce- ment in 33:20 that human beings cannot see God and live, so this offensive idea is omitted. The adjustments made by the LXX, however, modify the passage's principal motifs. Some elements remain constant: the ascent to the top of Mount Sinai, the presence of Moses with the three priests and seventy elders, and the meal they share there. Nevertheless, the God who is "seen" and "beheld" in the MT is per- 47 See ibid., 175-76. For example, David's exploits earn him the right to eat at Saul's table (see 1 Sam 20:25, 27). As king, David uses this privilege both to reward the loyal members of Saul's household and to oblige them to ongoing loyalty (2 Sam 9:1-13). 48 See ibid., 180-82. 49 Ibid., 178-79.</page><page sequence="17">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 69 1 ceived only indirectly in the LXX. In a style that borders on Tov's midrashic cat- egory, the expansions in points 2 and 8 introduce a new element, God's "place," which supplants God's person as the primary point of reference. The passage reads as an encounter with a divine place rather than a divine being. The leaders see this place (v. 10a) and even appear in it themselves (v. 1 lb), but they never see the God of Israel. This is why the sapphire brickwork of the place is described (v. 10b), but not the divine appearance. How could such a reorientation have been justified? What could have prompted the interpretation of the un vocalized Hebrew and of the passage's nar- rative discourse that seems to have occasioned the expansions in the text? Perhaps the Hebrew original was understood in a manner not unlike Thomas B. Dozeman's recent proposal.50 He maintains that vv. 9-11 offer a vision of the heavenly temple that provides the model for an earthly sanctuary. In his view, the earlier theophany in 19:16-19 lacks rituals for the people's sanctification and a sanctuary to contain God's holiness. The redactionally complex text of Exodus 24 addresses both of these issues, with vv. 3-8 providing the former and vv. 9-11 the latter. Dozeman points out that the lapis lazuli stone mentioned in v. 1 Ob was used in temple con- struction in the ancient Near East, and that God's throne in the visions of Ezek 1:26 and 10:1 is made of the same material. The blue color of this stone and the text's reference to the clarity of the sky, he suggests, give the impression that the veil between heaven and earth has momentarily been lifted. In this way, the vision and meal atop Sinai connect the covenant narrative in Exodus with the instructions for building the sanctuary that follow. There are elements in the text that can be construed to support Dozeman's suggestion, increasing the likelihood that the ancients may have read these verses in a similar vein. God directs Moses, the priests, and the elders to climb Sinai in order to "worship from afar" (24: 1). An earthly sanctuary would indeed provide a "place" where God could be worshiped from afar. There it would be possible for humans to draw near to the divine presence and not perish (24: 11a). Moreover, the place revealed to Israel's leaders (vv. 10a, 1 lb) is described as being beneath God's feet (v. 10b). Elsewhere in the OT, the dwelling place of God and of the ark is described as "his footstool" (Ps 132:7 MT) or "the place where his feet stood" (Ps 131:7 LXX), and as "a place for the feet of our God" (1 Chr 28:2). Lamentations 2:1 similarly equates "daughter Zion" with "God's footstool." It is noteworthy that the three texts cited by Ska in support of interpreting 24:9-11 as an endorsement of Israel's leaders also make reference to Jerusalem, Mount Zion, and the temple. Jeremiah 30:21 comes as part of an oracle that pro- claims the rebuilding of Zion and its citadel. The scene envisioned in Isa 24:23 50 See Thomas B. Dozeman, Commentary on Exodus (Eerdmans Critical Commentary; Grand Rapids/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2009) 567-68.</page><page sequence="18">692 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 74,2012 takes place "on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem," while Zech 3:7 refers to God's house and God's courtyards. Thus, the insertion of "place" into Exod 24:9-1 1 has a theological explanation that goes beyond simply eliminating a contradiction of the command in 33:20 not to look at the deity. God's subsequent indication that there is a "place" nearby (33:21) provides the solution not only because of its proximity in the text but because of a connotation with Israel's earthly sanctuary. In 29:31, the sacred precinct in the tent of meeting where Aaron and his sons prepare and offer sacri- fices is referred to as the holy "place." Elsewhere in the Torah, Deuteronomy con- sistently uses "place" to refer to the future cultic site that Yhwh will designate (Deut 12:5, 11; 16:16; 17:8, 10; 18:6; 31:11). In Leviticus, the holy "place" is where the priests offer sacrifice (Lev 6:20 [Eng. 6:27]; 16:24) and apropos of Exod 24:11b, eat their portion (Lev 6:9, 19[Eng. 6:16, 26]; 7:6; 10:13, 17; 14:13; 24:9).51 Therefore, when the word "place" is inserted into 24:9-11, it combines with ele- ments already present in the text and their intertextual associations to become the passage's primary motif.52 The result is that the LXX makes explicit a préfiguration of Mount Zion and the Jerusalem temple that is only implicit in the Hebrew orig- inal. In this way, the passage's literary function is somewhat altered. In the MT, these verses read as a legitimation of Israel's leaders that leads into the preparation of a sanctuary. In the LXX, however, they read as a revelation of Israel's sanctuary to its leaders, a privilege that confers authority and prestige on the priesthood and the council of elders. "Seeing" and "eating" still serve as credentials, but in this case it is seeing God's sanctuary and eating in its precincts. Consequently, the theological claims of the LXX reading are slightly different from those of the MT. The divine institution of the priests' and elders' leadership roles still comes across clearly, but for a different reason. God grants them the privilege of being the first to see, in a vision, the future sanctuary and share a meal there. The communion and coresponsibility among them are signified by the fact that they appear together in God's place (v. lib). The council of elders is still pres- ent, but the prophetic dimension all but disappears, since Moses and the others do not see God. Israel's priesthood, instead, becomes more prominent. The references to Aaron's sons, God's place, that which is under God's feet, the precious stone, survival in God's presence, and eating and drinking in the sacred precincts all con- tribute to the cultic imagery that evokes Mount Zion as much as, if not more than, Mount Sinai. Thus, Moses and the Sinai covenant remain present as legitimating authorities but alongside an equally important Jerusalem-Zion-temple theology. 51 See also the use of "place" to refer to the temple or its sanctuary in the narrative of the transfer of the ark and the inauguration of the temple by Solomon (1 Kgs 8:6, 7, 21, 29ab, 30ab). ^ Joosten ("To See God, 287) writes, "Many [LXX] renderings reveal the more or less unconscious working of an enormous web of intertextuality."</page><page sequence="19">WHEN DOES TRANSLATION BECOME EXEGESIS? 693 In these verses, God's place is the point of encounter between the divine and the human, that which mediates the meeting between God and divinely appointed lead- ers. In the LXX reading, therefore, it is the Jerusalem temple and the theology sur- rounding it that provide the common locus for the diverse theological claims and traditions present in these verses. V. Conclusion When does translation become exegesis? It happened in Exod 24:9-1 1 when the decision was made to fulfill an agenda external to the text itself. The LXX reading succeeds in resolving contradictions, ambiguities, and elements that could have been misunderstood, but only by reaccommodating the passage's principal motifs according to a tendentious interpretation of the Hebrew original. Not sur- prisingly, the result is a text that contains no fewer than four instances of theolog- ically motivated exegesis in just three verses. The manner in which these are incorporated bespeaks a certain cleverness in devising solutions that could be defended but also an undeniable respect for the sacred text and familiarity with it. It is a tribute to the resourcefulness of the anonymous ancient scribes and/or trans- lators that the LXX reading does not transmute the passage's literary function or theological claims into something completely unrelated to those of the Hebrew original. Rather, it modifies them, inviting the reader to make a connection between two holy mountains, Sinai and Zion.</page></plain_text>
