<plain_text><page sequence="1">The World and God: A Study of Prayer, Providence and Miracle in Christian Experience. By H. H. FARMER, M.A., Professor of Systematic Theology at Westminster College, Cambridge. London: Nisbet &amp; Co., Ltd., 1935. Pp. xvi + 315. lOs. 6d. THE series of which this volume is a member presents an apologetic based otherwise than on authority, against which revolt is rife to-day, and of the same type as the endeavour of Schleiermacher to find a new foundation for theology as an autonomous science. Religious experience, in other words, is the starting-point adopted for the approach to Christian theism and for the construction of theology. Mr. Farmer's contribution to the series is intended to meet especially the factor in the present situation which consists in the diminished sense of personality, characterising current estimates of human nature and conceptions of deity, and which he attributes partly to the prevalence of mechanistic and of monistic types of philosophy and partly to economic and political conditions. Hence his book is an exposition of what is involved in divine and human personality, of religion as consisting in personal relations between God and individual men, and of theology concerning revelation, providence, etc., based on religious experience. Inasmuch as in his chapters dealing with these subjects it is insisted that philoso- phical approaches, from knowledge of the world and man, to theism involve substitution of the abstractions of thought for the realities of religious experience to which they are irrelevant, and that religion, because of the certainty of its own awarenesses, is not perturbed by facts apparently contradicting it, by the indemonstrableness of some of its convictions, or by impenetrable mysteries encompassing it about, it is plain that the validity of his theology, in so far as its distinctive features are concerned, depends on the validity of his fundamental tenet that in religious experience is contained know- ledge, non-inferential in nature, of a personal God and of His action on the world and individual souls. As this issue, together with such questions as are closely connected with it, is the one among the many raised in Mr. Farmer's work that is of chief importance</page><page sequence="2">242 CRITICAL NOTICES: and interest to philosophers, it may fittingly be accorded more atten- tion here than such topics as belong as much to the sphere of religious as to that of philosophical literature. I will therefore devote my space to an examination of the view, as it is set forth in this volume, that religious experience involves direct apprehension of a real realm, as distinct either from ideal objects or from abstract validities, and is sufficient of itself, or without presuppositions derived else- where, to vouch for the reality of that realm. This view receives partial expression when, in the opening sentence of Chapter i. it is proposed to inquire as to what is involved in " the living awareness of God as personal ". By ' living ' is here meant an awareness quite other than the merely theoretical ascription of personality to the ultimate ground of the world based on philoso- phical reasoning, and an awareness which, in that it " includes feeling and will as well as ideas ", has determinative influence on personal life. Fuller descriptions of the 'living awareness ' shall be cited presently, but here already emerge two points as to which the author's thought may be further indicatea at this stage. One of these is the relation of interest to cognition. Inclusion of feeling and will is an ambiguous predicate to apply to awareness; and in other passages as well as in this, in which Mr. Farmer alludes to the relation in question, he does not make it quite plain whether he merely implies that feeling and will may be instrumental to cog- nitive seeking and finding, and be accompaniments or consequents of cognitions-in which case everyone would agree with him-or he holds (as some members of the 'experience-school' do) that feeling, besides being a subjective state, is also a cognitive function -an apprehension of 'feelables ', so to say. Statements such as that " knowledge " of God is not "given" through the merely intellectual processes (p. 86), may naturally cause misunderstanding as to what his meaning is, in the absence of any definite repudiation of the one of these possible senses of the ambiguous word 'includes '. Elsewhere he affirms the awareness of God to be " rooted in " the human interest of self-fulfilment, and observes (p. 37) that such "rootedness " does not impugn the veracity of the intuition as a report of the real world. One may agree as to that; but is it enough, as is said further on, " to guard against the error . . of thinking that where interest and valuation enter, genuine knowledge of necessity departs" ? Is it not as necessary to guard against the converse error of thinking that where interest enters genuine know- ledge arrives ? That belief as to a given proposition is or is not motivated by interest is irrelevant to whether that proposition is a trte report of reality; and the question whether a given pro- position is known to be true is one which involves consideration only of its logical grounds. As regards the other point which has already emerged, the dis- tinction between living awareness and philosophically reasoned belief, the author's thought receives further expression in the</page><page sequence="3">H. H. FARMER, The World and God. 243 following passage (p. 158): " Our interest is in the Christian experience of God as personal, which in the nature of the case must be self-authenticating and able to shine in its own light independently of the abstract reflections of philosophy, for if it were not, it could hardly be a living experience of God as personal ". Philosophical argument, it is said (p. 234), can never do more than attempt to show that the theistic hypothesis is a reasonably probable one; and it is added that philosophies do not go far when looked at from the angle of living religious conviction. Convincedness, however, is a matter of personal biography, while philosophies are concerned with public truth; and- sanguine convincedness as to credenda is compatible-as in the case of Bishop Butler-with recognition that, in respect of logical grounding, they are but probable. Lastly, it may be mentioned that, when Mr. Farmer attributes abstractness to philosophy and its methods, he refers especially to its omission to take into account the unique situations which evoke religious response or '-awareness' in individuals singly. Another characteristic of the living awaretess is that it is an outcome of intuition, in the sense of synthesis issuing in synopsis, or involuntary fusion of 'awarenesses' in a sort of intuitional flash. There is no doubt that immediacy, in the temporal sense of rapidity of intake, attaches to such intuition; but that, of course, does not guarantee the truth of the synoptic judgement, since it may rest on faulty presuppositions or be a synthesis of unverified or erroneous opinions. Mr. Farmer, however, seems to have more confidence as to the veracity of such judgements, in so far as the sphere of religion is concerned, than in such as are furnished by the analytical method as used in the sciences. In particular, he asserts (p. 25 and neighbouring pp.) that the resistance to man's will, set up by values which are unconditional in the sense that they " are appre- hended as calling for obedience literally at any cost ", and pointing the way of man's final succour, "is immediately known as the approach of the personal ultimate i .e., God, to the soul.. If this truth-claim for the ' living awareness' could be established we should indeed be put in possession of a short cut to a theistic conclusion, and of a 'short way' with philosophical probabilities and academic doubt. But- I can discover no vindication of the author's right to use the all-important words " immediately known " in the foregoing citation. In the first place there are passages in this book which cause me to wonder whether Mr. Farmer is always sufficiently alive to the difference between certainty in the sense of personal convincedness and certainty in the sense of an objective and logical characteristic of some propositions-which sense alone is involved when knowledge is being discussed. This remark may not be relevant to the particular statement with which we are now concerned, but one could wish that throughout this work there were a more explicit recognition of the distinction between these different senses of the</page><page sequence="4">244 CRITICAL NOTICES: one word: sometimes the one is used, sometimes the other, and sometimes they seem to be used as if they were identical. But the important question here is whether immediate knowledge, rather than personal convincedness, can justly be asserted with regard to the alleged identity between unconditional values and the 'approach of God'. One notices that in several places such knowledge is expressly said to be property of the religious mind, i.e., of the theist; but in that case the demonstrandum is presupposed. Another presupposition involved is that the forthcomingness of unconditional values necessarily bespeaks their imposition by some will; or, if that be not presupposed, it must be apprehended as self-evident: in which case it should leap to the eyes of those who have no religious prepossessions, and certainly should not have escaped the anxious search of Kant 'who, like others who have constructed moral arguments, would have rejoiced to be able to substitute a self-evident apprehension for a postulate. The immediacy of the apprehension of personality in the case of God does not receive proof from Mr. Farmer independently of his endeavour to prove it in the case of human personality; but transi- tion from the one to the other and very different case is apparently deemed to be effected by the remark that " the experience of our fellows and the experience of God as personal are intimately bound up with one another ", so that to treat of the case which is " more easily susceptible of analysis " is sufficient. His argument that knowledge of other selves is immediate consists in a repudiation of the alternative view, the case for which does not seem to have received the careful attention that, considering the importance of the issue involved, is called for. The genetic theory proceeds on the presumption that, before we can attribute selfhood to certain physical objects resembling and behaving like our own body, we must have some notion of our own bodily self, for the origination of which notion the somatic sensations and other psychological happenings are -appealed to. Such data being absent in the case of our coming to know other selves, and other persons' mental acts and states not being directly apprehensible by us-it would be an appalling world if they were-it would seem that knowledge of other selves can only arise through a process of ejection or analogising. This genetic theory does not assume that the individual is at first " shut up within the circle of his own private sense-impressions ", which is Mr. Farmer's first charge against it, but eschews such pure sen- sationism. Nor does it invoke an innate, yet fully developed, capacity for explicit reasoning by analogy-his second charge- but rather a capacity for germinal, crude, or implicit analogising, such as needs to be postulated also in a genetic explanation of the developed perception of things. When Mr. Farmer says that we have no experience elsewhere of analogical inference producing full assurance such as we have as to other selves, does he not over- look anthropomorphic mythologies and theologies, and the primitive</page><page sequence="5">H. H. FARMER, The World and God. 245 notion of efficient causality ? And is not the assurance accounted for by the unfailing pragmatic verification which the analogising venture receives ? The only other criticism that is passed on the view that he rejects, while examining what is somewhat of a parody of it, is that it presupposes Cartesian dualism. But here again he seems to miss the point: for, if matter and spirit were one sub- stance and not two, it would remain a fact that mental acts differ from material events, and that the means and ways of their being cognised respectively are different. I thus conclude that Mr. Farmer has not refuted the view that knowledge of selfhood and of personality is of the mediated and inferential kind. It only remains, in connection with the truth-claim of the 'living awareness ', to observe that the immediateness which is said to characterise that awareness is not the kind of immediateness which imparts what is called self-evidence to propositions such as we have no option but to accept and which have no dependence on other propositions. This latter kind of immediacy is unmediatedness, or indiscernibility of any mediation. We encounter it here and there, as in sensation, apprehension of some simple relations such as likeness, relations between ideas in the spheres of mathematics, logic and ethics, and probably in int-nitive inductions: but certainly not in synoptic judgements about the world. Independence, logical or psychological as the case may be, is thus what 'immediateness ' in this sense, means, or is defined as. When, therefore, Mr. Farmer says " there is a tendency to confuse immediacy with independence ", he is not really laying claim to the immediacy which is involved when we credit some judgements with objective or logical certainty; and the other kind of immediacy, that in which 'instantaneousness' becomes the essential characteristic, is of itself not determinative of the truth of a synoptic judgement that may possess it. If the foregoing criticism of the view that religious experience is self-authenticating as to its certainty be sound, religious belief -which is all that ' awareness ' can then mean-must find its ultimate grounds elsewhere, and such experience cannot be made the basis of an apologetic such as would convince the unconvinced. I have represented that the unique data, so called, of religious experience are not the pure data for which they have been taken-4.e., are not pure in the qualified sense in which data which are also recepta ever can be pure-but are data overlaid with explicated interpreta- tive ideas. These ideas are concealed by usage of the word ' im- mediate' in the one of its senses when the other sense is requisite and it is by their importation into experience that such experience is constituted religious, and sui generis. They are derived, it seems to me, from without-from ordinary knowledge of the world and man. If so, we are brought back to philosophy, and to the probable and reasonable as contrasted with the certain. If that basis of apolo- getic be eschewed, as in the work before us, it seems to me that the apologist shuts himself in the realm of private convincedness</page><page sequence="6">246 CRITICAL NOTICES: and psychological causes of belief, which has not necessarily any connection with the realm- of communicable knowledge or reason- able grounds. Indeed, it may be remarked in conclusion, when Mr. Farmer proceeds to the discussion of revelation, providence and miracle, and substitutes for the received denotations of the names of those things others for which he has a preference, he confines himself in very large measure to the consideration of the deliverances of individual convincedness and its personal conditionings. As an exposition of theistic and Christian conviction throughout a wide range of reference and application, his work will be found impressive by those who share such conviction. The religion which he describes and interprets is of the exalted and pure kind, free from the dilutions of its essence, and from the infiltrations of extraneous elements, incidental to some presentations of Christianity.
