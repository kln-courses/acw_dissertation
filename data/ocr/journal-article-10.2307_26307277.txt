McCafferty Department of Anthropology, Brown University, Providence, Rl 02912, USA Abstract The Great Pyramid of Cholula is both the largest and oldest continuously occupied building in Mesoamerica. Initial occupation of the ceremonial precinct began in the Late Formative period, and the first building stage of the pyramid dates to the Terminal Formative. The Great Pyramid was built in four major construction stages and at least nine minor modifications. Early stages shared stylistic similarities with Teotihuacan, but toward the end of its construction history external contacts shifted to the Gulf Coast, particularly El Tajin, and probably relate to occupation by ethnic Olmeca Xicallanca. The fourth and final stage was contemporary with extensive construction on the south side at the Patio of the Altars, and dates to the Early Postclassic period. This period ended, however, with the partial abandonment of the pyramid when ethnic Tolteca-Chichimeca constructed a ceremonial center around their "new" Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl. The Great Pyramid continued as an important shrine dedicated to mountain worship and a rain deity until the Spanish Conquest. It remains one of the most important religious sites in Mexico, where the shrine of the Virgin of the Remedies attracts pilgrims to the church atop the pyramid mound during the annual festival. This paper summarizes the archaeological and ethnohistorical information available to reinterpret the construction history and ideological content of the pyramid throughout its long existence. Despite an extensive archaeological and ethnohistorical record, the religious center of Cholula remains one of the great enigmas of ancient Mesoamerica. Yet because of the confused and often contradictory nature of these accounts, Cholula has tended to drop out of historical syntheses of central Mexico except for general comments about its overall importance and dismay over gaps ip the site's history (e.g., Adams 1991:224; Weaver 1993: 206). As the dominant archaeological feature of Cholula, and the focus of most of the archaeological investigations, the Great Pyramid is a valuable key to understanding Cholula's culture history (Figure 1). The purpose of this paper is to address the confusion, synthesizing information from previous studies with recent observations to reinterpret the construction history and meaning content of the ceremonial center. A variety of obstacles hinder interpretation of pre-Columbian Cholula, including the "tunnel vision" of the early excavators who concentrated on architectural features of the Great Pyra mid via a maze of excavated tunnels used to explore buried facades of the multistage mound. A related problem with the Cholula data is the incomplete publication of results, often in obscure venues, with few attempts to summarize the informa tion (but see Mountjoy and Peterson 1973; Paddock 1987; Peterson 1987; Suárez C. and Martinez A. 1993). Archaeolog ically, excavations have frequently focused on construction fill without consideration of formation processes, resulting in min imal control over the depositional context of the recovered arti facts. As a consequence, site chronology remains poorly understood, and relies almost exclusively on relative chronol ogy rather than archaeometric dates (but see McCafferty 1996). Cholula's historical sequence has often been "borrowed" uncrit ically from the Valley of Mexico without consideration of its dis tinct cultural development (McCafferty 1992:230-241). Frustration over the site's chronology is heightened by dis crepancies in culture-historical reconstructions for the site be tween ethnohistorical accounts of continuous occupation during the Classic-Postclassic transition, and archaeological interpre tations of a break in the cultural sequence representing Late Classic abandonment. Ethnohistorical accounts suggest a series of ethnic "invasions" beginning at the end of the Classic period, when the "giants," or quinametin, were supplanted first by Olmeca-Xicallanca, and later by Tolteca-Chichimeca popula tions (Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca 1976 [1547-1560]; Ixtlilxo chitl 1975-1977 [ 1625]: 1:529-530; also Davies 1977:106-120; Jiménez Moreno 1966:63). Under this interpretation the Great Pyramid was abandoned at the end of the age of the Olmeca Xicallanca when the Tolteca-Chichimeca built the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl at what is now the zócalo of San Pedro Cholula. This historical scenario was adopted in early archaeological syn theses of Cholula (e.g., Marquina 1951:115-129; Noguera 1954). In contrast, archaeologists from the Proyecto Cholula argue that the Great Pyramid was abandoned at the end of the Classic period (Dumond 1972; Dumond and Müller 1972; Müller 1970: 142; Marquina 1975). Several possible reasons for the hiatus have been suggested, including volcanic eruptions (Marquina 1975:112), flooding (Dumond and Müller 1972:1209-1210), and general social upheaval relating to the "collapse" of other Classic period centers (Suárez C. and Martinez A. 1993:26). Epiclassic period occupation of the nearby fortified hill of Cerro Zapotecas provides evidence that Cholula itself may have been partially abandoned during this period (Mountjoy 1987).</page><page sequence="2">McCafferty This paper focuses on the Great Pyramid and its associated ceremonial precinct, considering construction history, stylistic affinities with other regions of Mesoamerica, and symbolic con tent. In addition to synthesizing all available information, 1 hope to reconcile the archaeological record with the ethnohis torical accounts, specifically by demonstrating that the construc tion history of the Great Pyramid was both more complex and of longer duration than is currently accepted. HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF CHOLULA Cholula is located in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, an alluvial val ley separated from the Valley of Mexico by the Sierra Nevada, including the volcanoes Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl (Figure 2). Dependable rains between June and September and runoff from the nearby snow-covered mountains provide adequate water for intensive farming, making Cholula one of the most productive agricultural regions in central Mexico (Bonfil Batalla 1973:23; Super 1988). The high clay content in the local alluvial soil made pottery manufacturing and brickmaking historically important industries (Bonfil Batalla 1973:80-82). Finally, Cholula lies on trade routes linking the Valley of Mexico with the Gulf Coast and Oaxaca, and consequently it developed into a market cen ter for exotic goods (Durán 1971 [ 1576-1579]: 129, 278). The earliest archaeological remains discovered at Cholula date to the Middle Formative period based on diagnostic kaolin slipped pottery that has been found at several locations (Bara valle and Wheaton 1972; Caskey 1988; McCafferty 1984; Miiller 1978:220-221). Decorated ceramics and figurines include Olme coid motifs, indicating that Cholula's inhabitants shared in a pan-Mesoamerican religious ideology. Monumental architecture has been located in three areas, suggesting that Cholula was already a developing urban center by this time. By the Late For mative period Cholula may already have measured 2 km2 in area based on the discovery of discrete artifact concentrations' (McCafferty 1984, 1996). Although the Cholula region featured several other mounded sites during the Formative period (e.g., Coapa, Acatepec, Coronango, etc.), mound construction ap pears to stop at the end of the period, with Cholula becoming the dominant regional center. During the Classic period Cholula covered an area of about 4 km2 and shared ceramic and architectural styles with Teoti huacan (Dumond and Miiller 1972). Other features were distinc tive, however, including site orientation (Tichy 1981), so it is unlikely that Cholula was simply a satellite of the Teotihuacan Figure 1. Great Pyramid of Cholula from the west, showing reconstructed Stage 3B. empire (Millón 1988). Recent excavation of a Middle Classic period house from the urban zone of Cholula provides evidence for domestic and mortuary practices from the city (McCafferty and Suárez Cruz 1994). Figure 2. Map locating Cholula within central Mexico. 1 Due to the enormous amount of cultural deposition from nearly 3,000 years of occupation, compounded by Cholula's location in an allu vial basin, traditional methods of surface survey are not particularly effective. It is rare for materials predating the Postclassic to occur on the surface unless they are the result of redeposition. As a graduate stu dent at the Universidad de las Américas (1980-1984), I tried to identify diachronic settlement patterns within the urban center of Cholula. A more viable method for identifying subsurface features involves visual inspection of construction trenches, particularly those that reach sev eral meters in depth. Using this strategy I was able to identify a rich Mid dle Formative deposit associated with a cobble platform in San Andrés Cholula (McCafferty 1984). Investigators from the Puebla Regional Center (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia [INAH]) and the Universidad de las Américas conducted surveys and excavations of archaeological features exposed during an extensive drainage project that dug deep trenches throughout the city in the 1980s; unfortunately these materials remain unanalyzed for the most part (but see Fajardo 1985).</page><page sequence="3">The Great Pyramid of Cholula Postclassic Cholula is documented not only by archaeolog ical remains, but also by a rich ethnohistoric record. Unfortu nately, the two data sets are not always consistent, and the culture history of this period has been confusing. A series of eth nic "invasions" resulted in changing settlement patterns, prob ably including the partial abandonment of the Great Pyramid at the end of the Early Postclassic when the ceremonial center shifted to what is now the plaza of San Pedro Cholula. Cholula reached its maximum size during this period, at approximately 8 km2, with a population of 30,000-50,000 persons (Sanders 1971; but see Peterson 1987:71-73). It was at this time that the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl was a religious center for central Mex ico, with foreign nobles visiting the temples for political legiti mation (Rojas 1927 [1581]; Torquemada 1975-1983 [1615]: 1: 385-386). Quetzalcoatl was also patron deity of the pochteca merchants who traveled throughout Mesoamerica acquiring exotic and precious goods for sale in the Cholula market (Durán 1971 [ 1576— 1579]: 129; Pineda 1970 [ 1593]: 180-181). The Spanish Conquest devastated Cholula. Cortés stopped in Cholula en route to Tenochtitlan, and initiated the infamous massacre in which the Spaniards attacked Cholultecas assembled in front of the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl (Cortés 1986 [1519— 1521 ] :73-74; Diáz del Castillo 1963 [1580]: 198-200; Lienzo de Tlaxcala 1979 [1550-1564]: 26-27, lámina 9; Peterson and Green 1987). Furthermore, the colonial city of Puebla was established about 10 km east of Cholula in the 1530s, usurping political and religious authority from the pre-Columbian center (Torque mada 1975-1983 [1615]: 1:426—431). Although Cholula contin ued as a center of traditional culture and religion, its political and economic importance was greatly reduced. ETHNOHISTORIC ACCOUNTS OF THE GREAT PYRAMID The Great Pyramid, or Tlachihualtepetl ("man-made moun tain") in colonial accounts, had been abandoned long before the arrival of the Spanish, to the extent that the conquistadors took it for a natural hill (Marquina 1970:31). The archaeological sig nificance of the pyramid was quickly discovered, however, when "excavations" in 1535 by the Franciscan priest Toribio de Motolinia recovered "idols" and conch shell trumpets from the summit of the Great Pyramid while erecting a cross (Motolinia 1951 [ 1540]: 138-139; Rojas 1927 [1581]). Motolinia describes the earthen mound as resembling a small mountain upon which corn was cultivated and rabbits and snakes roamed (also Tor quemada 1975-1983 [1615]: 1:386). The sixteenth-century Span ish administrator of Cholula, Gabriel de Rojas (1927 [1581]), mentions a pagan shrine on top of the Great Pyramid that was dedicated to Chiconauquiahuitl, or 9 Rain. Durán (1971 [ 1576-1579]:257) also describes the Great Pyr amid in his discussion of mountain worship: In Cholula there was a man-made hill called Tlachihual tepetl. ... It was called thus because it is said that the Giants built it in order to climb up to the heavens; today it stands in ruins. This hill was much hallowed; there were the usual and unceasing adoration, the prayers, the great sacrifices, offerings, and slaying of men. The Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca (1976 [1547—1560]:7v, 9v lOr, 14r) provides Early Colonial period illustrations of the Great Pyramid as a natural hill covered with grass (Figure 3). Figure 3. Depiction of Great Pyramid with water emerging from base, frog and flower glyph at summit, and palace of Aquiach Amapane on platform (after Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca [1976:7v]). Streams of water emerge from a cave at the base of the mound, indicating the spring that still flows out from the east side where a small chapel provides access to the sacred waters. Sitting atop the mound is a frog, and seven flowers are depicted near the summit.2 A palace is depicted on the side of the pyramid, iden tified with the Aquiach Amapane, one of the high priests of the Olmeca-Xicallanca. The Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca (1976 [1547-1560]:26v-27r) also depicts the Cholula ceremonial center after it was reorga nized by the Tolteca-Chichimeca conquerors. Here the new Pyr amid of Quetzalcoatl dominates a plaza that includes several other pyramids (Figure 4). In the upper right is a small repre sentation of the abandoned Great Pyramid, again with the frog glyph on top and a spring at its base. The Great Pyramid is shown on early colonial maps of Chol ula, including one that was part of the Description de Cholula of 1580 (Rojas 1927 [1581]). The Codex of Cholula illustrates the Cholula kingdom at the time of the Conquest and features the pyramid as the central place glyph of the city (Lind 1995; Simons 1968a). ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT THE GREAT PYRAMID During the historic period, numerous travelers described the great earthen mound, recording measurements and observations about artifacts collected in the vicinity (Bandelier 1976 [1884]; Charnay 1887; Tylor 1970 [1861]). Beginning in 1930, two major research programs excavated on, in, and around the Great Pyr amid. The initial work was directed by Ignacio Marquina, assisted by Eduardo Noguera. In 1965, the investigations were 2Two of the images (9v-10r and 14r) depict 7 flowers, but 7v has only 6 flowers, probably because the frog's paw hangs down to where the seventh flower should have been.</page><page sequence="4">McCafferty Figure 4. Urban plan of Cholula with Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl in left center and Great Pyramid in upper right (after Historia Tolteca Chichimeca [1976:26v-27r]). renewed as the "Proyecto Cholula," initially under the direction of Miguel Messmacher, and later Marquina, assisted by Jorge Acosta and Florencia Míiller. Initial excavations focused on the identification of the dif ferent construction phases of the pyramid (Marquina 1939, 1951:115-129), with an additional aim of describing the ceramic sequence for the site (Noguera 1954). During the second phase of investigation, excavations were directed at the south and west sides of the pyramid where extensive architectural complexes were exposed (Marquina, ed. 1970; Messmacher 1967). Preliminary observations indicated that the pyramid was built in multiple stages, and therefore initial investigations sought to identify architectural features on the interior of the pyramid. Because of the immense size of the mound, explora tions were conducted by means of a series of tunnels, ultimately totaling 8 km in length (Marquina 1970:33). Tunnels cut along the north-south and east-west axes exposed facades of the var ious pyramid constructions. Other tunnels followed stairways and identified corners to discover the dimensions of the differ ent structures. Due to the limited scale of explorations of the various construction phases, as well as destruction of earlier stages by successive construction, descriptions of the architec tural features are often sketchy. Marquina identifies five phases of construction in a series of publications (Marquina 1951, 1970, 1975), yet careful reading of the accounts reveals that these phases are not consistent; some phases are dropped while others are added or renamed. For this reason I have found it useful to revise Marquina's des ignations of the different construction phases (Table 1). In my reinterpretation, I have synthesized Marquina's various accounts to identify four main stages of construction when the pyramid was expanded completely, plus nine phases of partial renova tion (Figure 5). This total does not include those separate build ings that were eventually swallowed up by the monumental expansion of the Great Pyramid, or the modern church. THE GREAT PYRAMID Construction techniques featured a nucleus of adobe bricks cov ered over by a veneer of mortared stone that was then finished with a plaster surface.

Revised plan of construction stages of Great Pyramid. differences in the dimensions of the adobe bricks that may relate to different construction phases. Some of the platforms on the south side of the pyramid contain earth fill rather than adobes. Variations in masonry practices are also apparent, with differ ing patterns in the stone courses. The most dramatic differences found are in the forms of the talud-tablero architectural facades (see Gendrop 1984:18-19; Salazar O. 1970a:78, Figure 15). De tailed studies of Cholula architectural elements offer potential for seriation of construction stages as well as identification of foreign influences relating to cultural interaction. The ceremonial precinct was occupied before initial construc tion of the Great Pyramid. Formative-period ceramics were abundant on the surface beneath the Pyramid (Noguera 1954: 199-200). They were also found in construction fill of the inner most stage of the Edificio Rojo (Noguera 1956) and in the archi tectural complex known as the Conejero (Müller 1973; Suárez Cruz and Martinez A. 1993:14). Two cosmological principles apparently structured the loca tion and orientation of the Great Pyramid. First, it was built over a natural spring. Unfortunately, the early stages of the pyr amid are poorly understood, so it is unknown to what extent the presence of the spring was incorporated into the symbolic mean ing of the building. An interior chamber was discovered deep inside the pyramid during explorations in the 1970s (Eduardo Merlo, personal communication 1980) that may relate to an arti ficial "cave" as a symbolic portal to the underworld (Heyden 1981). Sahagún (1950-1982 [1547-1585]:Introductory Vol ume:48) also recorded the presence of "mines or caves" within the Great Pyramid. The second characteristic of the pyramid that probably relates to its cosmological meaning is its orientation at 24-26° north of west (Marquina 1970:36; Tichy 1981:223). At this ori entation the western staircase of the Great Pyramid would face the sunset on the summer solstice (Tichy 1981:221), with atern ple on top of the pyramid illuminated by the last rays of light on the longest day of the year. Stage 1A was the innermost of the construction phases iden tified for the Great Pyramid. This pyramid was square, 120 m</page><page sequence="6">McCafferty on each side, and it stood about 17 m tall (Marquina 1970:36). This was the only construction phase with architectural remains preserved on the top platform, which measured 43 m square. Remains of a square building were found, with low walls mea suring 19 m on a side (Marquina 1970:39). Ceramics associated with this construction phase were identified as "Teotihuacan II," dating to the Terminal Formative period. The initial structure was covered over by a preserved facade (Stage IB) on the north side and the northwest and northeast corners. The architecture included Teotihuacan-style talud tablero features. In this case, the tableros were decorated with painted frescos using vivid colors to depict an insect-like body with a skeletal head, perhaps a butterfly in the process of meta morphosis (Marquina 1970:39, lámina 1). Stage 2A covered the previous structure, increasing its di mensions to 180 m on a side, with the height estimated at 35 m (Marquina 1970:39). The top platform measured 90 m square. The sides of this structure were composed of nine levels of slightly varying dimensions. The entire length of each side was made up of steps, so that access to the top was possible from any direction. This architectural plan is not duplicated elsewhere in Mesoamerica (Margain 1971:69). A wide staircase on the north side included a prominent set of 52 steps surrounded by smaller groups of 11 steps. The use of such significant numbers —nine levels as in the pre-Columbian underworld, 52 as in the num ber of years in the calendrical round —as architectural units implies yet another level of cosmological significance for this stage of the Great Pyramid. A series of five building facades (Stages 2B-2F) was inter sected by the central north tunnel, leading in from the present entrance to the archaeological zone. Little is known about these construction phases other than their relative positions after Stage 2A. It is unclear if these represent extensive rebuildings of the north facade of the pyramid or simply sequential enlarge ments of the north staircase. The facade of Stage 2G was exposed during road construc tion along the north side of the Great Pyramid. Marquina (1951: 122-123) speculated that Stage 2G resembled a series of broad platforms about 30 m above the original surface, surrounding a central pyramid that reached 66 m in height. The architectural style differs from the talud-tablero form typical of Teotihuacan in that the talud is larger than the vertical face. A tablero on a northeastern facade was painted with black rectangles outlined in white that resemble the pattern from the Temple of the Niches at El Tajin (Marquina 1970:40-41). An identical motif was found on Structure 4-A' in the Patio of the Altars south of the pyramid (Acosta 1970a:50). Stage 3A was perhaps the final complete rebuilding of the Great Pyramid, in which a new layer of adobe and stone fac ing covered all previous construction, with base dimensions of about 350 m to a side (Marquina 1970:41; 1975). Although it may not have increased in total height, the structure became a massive series of platforms surrounding the central peak. Little of the original facade of this structure has been found. Tunnels into the western extreme of the mound located well-built talud tablero architecture similar to that of Teotihuacan (Marquina 1970:41-43), and these facades were later exposed by the Pro yecto Cholula (Figure 6). Additional sections of Stage 3A were found on the south side of the pyramid (Salazar O. 1970b:68). Protruding from the western face of Stage 3A was a large platform (Stage 3B) constructed of cut and fitted stone, again in the talud-tablero style. This structure was partially disman tled in antiquity for later construction, so that only the south east and northeast portions remained intact where they attached to the exterior of the previous structure (Marquina 1970:41-44, Photos 1 and 3). The platform measured 70 m in length and 13 m in height. Whereas the talud was built of tightly fitted but plain rectangular blocks, the tablero consisted of a bordered panel of carved stone to form a woven mat motif3 (Figure 7). Stage 3C was partially removed in the process of reconstruct ing Stage 3B (Marquina 1970:41). It was a rounded structure, consisting of two steep talud units made of rough stone covered Figure 6. Stage 3A ta\ud-tab!ero architecture with Stage 3B on left and Stage 3C on right. 3 The mat motif as an architectural facade appears in the Maya area, most notably at Copan Structure 10L-22A, where it is identified as the popol na, or "mat house," and is interpreted as a place of politi cal council (Fash 1991:130-134). Mat motifs are also associated with concepts of nobility and political authority among the Mixtee and Aztec (Smith 1973:29, 109).</page><page sequence="7">The Great Pyramid of Cholula Figure 7. Mat motif on Stage 3B. with stucco and punctuated with jaggedly protruding pieces of black basalt. Ironically, while Stage 3B has been called the "Pir ámide Tolteca" because of the use of "Cemento Tolteca" con crete in its reconstruction, Stage 3C closely resembles Structure B at the Toltec capitol of Tula in its use of black stones embed ded in the steep sides of the pyramid. These stones may have supported the stucco on the steep slope of the pyramid, while providing a visual impression of obsidian blades protruding from the structure (e.g., the White Hill of Flints in the Codex Nuttall 1975:196). Capping the architectural remains described above is yet an other layer of adobe construction (Stage 4), with base measure ments of approximately 400 m on a side. Finished architectural surfaces were not recovered, indicating that this final construc tion phase was either never completed or that the stone facing was removed for subsequent construction, perhaps for the Late Postclassic Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl. The Patio of the Carved Skulls located on the northeast plat form of the Great Pyramid, is associated with this final con struction stage. This location corresponds with the palace of the Aquiach priest Amapane that is depicted in the Historia Tolteca Chichimeca (1976:7v). The archaeological remains are of an elite residential compound with a miniature pyramid-shaped tomb covered with stucco and originally decorated with sculpted plas ter skulls (Noguera 1937; Figure 8). The "altar" covered the skel etal remains of two adult individuals, a male and a female, and contained grave goods including diagnostic Early Postclassic ceramics. Recent excavations explored adjacent sections of the Patio of the Carved Skulls, recovering detailed information about its construction sequence and cultural identities of the inhabitants (McCafferty and Suárez Cruz 1995). Ceramics from the different deposits of construction fill include a combination of Classic-period types (e.g., Tepontla Burnished Gray) with Early Postclassic diagnostics (e.g., Cocoyotla Black on Natural). The blending of the two ceramic complexes suggests a gradual transition between the two periods rather than abrupt popula tion change. THE CEREMONIAL PRECINCT In addition to the Great Pyramid itself, the surrounding ceremo nial precinct provides important evidence for interpreting the historical development of the center (Table 2). Large mounds located on the north and west sides of the pyramid probably represent plaza groups, though the specific orientation of rit ual activities seems to have shifted through time. A series of pla zas with large platforms and stela and altar groups are located on the south side of the pyramid. An extensive platform located on the east side of the pyramid is partially covered by modern construction and has never been excavated. The main plaza to the west of the Great Pyramid has re ceived very little archaeological attention, and the large mound, Cerro Cocoyo (also called Acozac and Cerro de la Cruz4), on the west side of the plaza is almost completely unexplored (Fig ure 9). Cerro Cocoyo measures about 160 m in length and 15 m in height (Bandelier 1976 [ 1884]:229—230). It features a large raised platform on the west side that may have been a ritual/ residential area. Ceramics from the surface of this platform indicate that it was in use during the Early Postclassic period, but the mound itself was probably built during the Classic period. Architectural elements exposed in roadcuts into the sides of the mound indicate that it was built in several construction stages. The spatial arrangement of the Great Pyramid, plaza, and Cerro Cocoyo would have created a major forum for public rit ual. Unfortunately, the urban growth of modern Cholula has severely impacted these archaeological resources, with the rail road crosscutting the plaza, modern buildings covering the north and south sides of the plaza, and houses encroaching on the platform behind Cerro Cocoyo. An adobe nucleus located about 200 m south of Cerro Cocoyo represents yet another significant pyramid mound, but it has been "mined" on all sides so that only the core remains with no evidence for its original dimen sions (Bandelier 1976 [ 1884]:228-229). The Edificio Rojo is another large pyramidal mound, located northeast of the Great Pyramid (Noguera 1956). The southern face of this structure features a broad staircase and two levels of talud-tablero architecture (Figure 10). Although this pyra mid was originally separate from the Great Pyramid, it was 4Bandelier (1976:230) notes that the name derives from a small chapel that was located on the summit (the foundation is still visible on the northern end of the mound), and he recorded the legend that it was here that the first mass was said in Cholula in 1519.</page><page sequence="8">McCafferty Figure 8.

Tunnels into the Edificio Rojo identified at least two earlier phases of con struction, including one with preserved structural remains on the top (Noguera 1956). The most extensive archaeological investigations at the cer emonial precinct have been conducted on the south side of the pyramid, including the Patio of the Altars, the Southeast Patio, and the Southwest Plaza. The Patio of the Altars is a large plaza located at the base of the south stairway of the Great Pyramid. It is arranged symmetrically along the principal north-south axis of the mound and originally measured more than 80 m in width (Acosta 1970a). The plaza is bounded on the west and east by large buildings (Structures 3 and 4, respectively), on the north by the pyramid itself, and is open to the south. A succession of at least six building episodes elevated the plaza to 9 m above the original surface. A large staircase leads up from the patio to a platform of the pyramid. On either side of this staircase, and continuing around the patio on Structures 3 and 4 is a shallow talud decorated with interlaced "T"-shaped grecas. This motif is representative of a "greca tradition" found in the Late Classic and Early Postclas sic at sites in Oaxaca, the Gulf Coast, and in the Maya area (Sharp 1978), and are common architectural features depicted in Mixtee codices. On the east side of the Patio of the Altars is a platform des ignated Structure 4 (Acosta 1970a). A tunnel discovered the ear liest phase of Structure 4 (4A'), which differs in architectural style from the later facades in that it lacks the greca frieze. Instead, it has a high talud with a simple cornice decorated with large black painted squares outlined in white, in a pattern iden tical to that found on Stage 2G of the Great Pyramid (Acosta 1970a: 50). Polychrome murals on the tableros of subsequent stages of Structure 4 depict diagonal bands and stars (Marquina 1970:lámina 2). On the west side of the Patio of the Altars is another series of superimposed construction phases, designated Structure 3. The earliest phase of this structure was exposed for a distance of 60 m, and included a 12-m-wide stairway (Salazar O. 1970b:67). The facade is decorated with elaborately painted friezes of multicolored diagonal bands similar to those on Structure 4, and with a polychrome woven mat design (Marquina 1970:lámina 3). Structure 3-1-A covered this initial structure and was the first phase of Structure 3 to use the greca motif. The facade also bore painted friezes, including the famous Bebedores ("drinkers") murals, discussed below. Structure 3-2 was only partially explored; a tunnel discovered that it attached to the south face of Stage 3A of the Great Pyramid (Salazar O. 1970b:68). The Bebedores mural is a long sequence of images, about 60 m in length by about 2.5 m in height, arranged on either side of a central staircase (Marquina 1971; Müller 1972). The panel features about 100 anthropomorphic characters shown drink ing what is presumed to be pulque, the alcoholic drink made from fermented maguey. The figures are predominantly male, dressed simply in maxtlatl loincloths but with headdresses, ear plugs, and occasional collars (Figure 11). The scene may rep resent ritualized drunkenness, and is painted in a uniquely sur realistic style (Kubler 1990:64-65; Müller 1972). Numerous carved stone monuments were found in the Patio of the Altars. Altar 1 was found on the east side of the plaza, in front of the Structure 4 stairway (Acosta 1970b). It consisted of fragments of carved stone that, when reconstructed, formed an upright stela (height = 3.85 m, width = 2.0 m) attached to the back of a flat altar (length = 2.89 m, width = 2.59 m, thick ness = 34 cm; Figure 12). Both were decorated with carved, cur vilinear volutes in a 37-cm border that framed a blank center. Altar 2 is located directly across the patio from Altar 1 (Acosta 1970c). Although this 10-ton stone was cracked, it was found in situ about 2 m beneath the surface. Altar 2 measured 4.23 x 3.97 m, and rested on a low platform about 80 cm in height. It is decorated with a border of low relief carving on the north, east, and south edges of its top and sides. The curvilinear volutes on the upper surface are identical to those of Altar 1. On the sides, however, the pattern is a detailed representation of two serpents (Figure 13). Figure 11. Detail of Bebedores mural showing seated Individual with pos sible zoomorphic head (rabbit?) and smaller figure as servant.</page><page sequence="10">McCafferty Figure 12. Altar 1. Excavations at the north end of the Patio of the Altars dis covered another carved stone, designated Altar 3 (Contreras 1970). The large fragment was found lying with its carved face down, on top of a small platform centered in front of the stair way. This stone matched a fragment excavated in the fill behind Altar 2, even though it was found 40 m away. The two pieces were mended, and the complete stela was placed upright on top of the small platform at the north end of the patio. The stela is decorated with a border of carved volutes around an undec orated center, in a style similar to Altars 1 and 2. Because of the original location of the base fragment, it is possible that this stela was originally paired with Altar 2 as part of an altar and stela group and a symmetrical counterpart to Altar 1 (Peterson 1987:89). Several other stone monuments were discovered in the Patio of the Altars, including a "colossal head," a stucco-covered anthropomorphic (?) figure, and a basalt obelisk. The "head" measures over a meter in diameter, with a shallow depression on the top (Figure 14). It is notable for its thick lips and circular eyes that bear a gross resemblance to Olmec colossal heads, though it is not of comparable size, quality, or antiquity. A source for comparison that is closer both temporally and spatially is a large carved head from San Juan Diuxi in the Mixteca Alta that features round eyes, a triangular nose, and fang-like teeth that are characteristic of rain-related supernaturals throughout central Mexico (Byland and Pohl 1994:11-12, Figure 3). The stucco-covered sculpture is difficult to identify because of the figure's contorted position, but the bent legs of the reclin ing figure may relate to a "chac-mool." The basalt obelisk resembles Aztec sacrificial stones, but would have been too tall unless used in association with a scaffold or platform. Excavations to the southeast of the Patio of the Altars exposed a long building facade, designated Structure 5, running along an east-west orientation, and preserved to a height of 4.8 m in two successive taludes (Acosta 1970d). An earlier con struction stage of this structure had talud-tablero architecture very similar to that of Stage 3A of the Great Pyramid (Acosta 1970d:66). The well-preserved tablero retained a polychrome mural of an undulating feathered serpent in red, green, yellow, and blue outlined in black. Covering Structure 5 is yet another platform construction (Structure 6), and in front of this structure is a broad patio con sisting of distinctive mosaic flagstones arranged in decorative squares (Acosta 1970d:66). The patio floor is located about 1.5 m Figure 13. Altar 2.</page><page sequence="11">The Great Pyramid of Cholula 11 Figure 14. Colossal head from Patio of the Altars. above the sterile tepetate subsoil and 5.15 m below the ground surface (Miiller 1970:Figure 22). This distinctive patio was extensive, with remnants found about 300 m away on the south side of the Great Pyramid. It is also exposed by erosion in the dirt road on the north side of the Edificio Rojo (about 700 m to the north) and in a dirt road about 500 m to the east. In an attempt to relate the Patio of the Altars to the Mosaic Patio, a 6-m-wide by 60-m-long trench was dug south from the Patio of the Altars (Acosta 1970a:52). Although the trench was excavated to a depth of 6.4 m, there was no evidence of a stair way descending to the lower patio. In fact, the main feature dis covered was a miniature-pyramid altar (the so-called "Altar Mexica") located at a depth of about 3 m beneath the final level of the Patio of the Altars (Figure 15). This discovery is signifi cant because it provides a stratigraphic context that can be used to link the depositional sequence for the Patio of the Altars to the ceramic sequence. Based on architectural features and ceramics, the "Altar Mexica" dates to the Early Postclassic period (Acosta 1970a:52), and it is stratigraphically associated with an early phase of patio construction. The Southwest Plaza is located to the west of the Patio of the Altars (Salazar O. 1970a). The principal feature is Structure 2, a platform made up of steep taludes that began as a separate structure but eventually became attached to the south face of the pyramid. This area shows evidence of both monumental construction and destruction as earlier building phases were not only covered over but also razed during subsequent renovation. A series of Epiclassic patio groups with miniature altars later covered this plaza complex (Salazar O. 1970a:87). An elaborate burial in this area included a skeleton with distinctive physio logical features (e.g., tabular oblique cranial deformation and inlaid teeth) and grave goods (e.g., greenstone beads and figu rine, and shell ornaments) to suggest that this may have been a "Maya" merchant or priest (Suárez Cruz 1985).

"Altar Mexica" beneath Patio of the Altars.</page><page sequence="12">12 McCafferty DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The Great Pyramid of Cholula is among the largest and most enduring examples of monumental architecture known from the pre-Columbian world. Yet despite a long and often intense his tory of archaeological investigation, many fundamental ques tions still hamper attempts to synthesize a culture history of either the Great Pyramid or Cholula itself. The interpretations presented in this paper are intended as a preliminary step in summarizing what has been done while illuminating problem areas for future research. The most immediate problem for reinterpreting Cholula's culture history is chronology. Previous attempts at establishing the historical sequence have depended on events from the Val ley of Mexico, to the extent that phases were imported directly (Müller 1970, 1978; Noguera 1954). Unfortunately, few con trolled contexts are available to seriate the ceramic sequence, and while a few absolute dates are available to calibrate the sed ation, none exist from the Great Pyramid (McCafferty 1996). Foremost among the chronological problems relating to the Great Pyramid is the question of when and to what extent it was abandoned. Suárez Cruz and Martinez A. (1993:24-26) provide the clearest statement of the traditional interpretation, and con clude that the pyramid was abandoned at the end of the Classic period, with a complete break between Classic and Postclassic ceramic traditions (Müller 1970:131). But recent excavations at the Patio of the Carved Skulls contradict this interpretation, and instead suggest a gradual transition between Classic and Post classic material assemblages (McCafferty and Suárez Cruz 1995). Ceramics from the Patio of the Altars, particularly the "Altar Mexica," indicate extensive occupation during the Early Post classic period. Several additional lines of evidence converge to support an Early Postclassic time frame for construction on the south side of the pyramid. First, the Mosaic Patio was immediately below a level associated with Late Classic ceramics. Thirty-five cen timeters above the mosaic surface was a layer of charcoal and ash mixed with Early Postclassic ceramics, and above that were 3 m of Postclassic deposits. In fact, analysis of stratified ceram ics from the excavation unit where the Mosaic Patio was found indicated that 96% of the pottery (n = 8,214) dates to the Post classic or later (Müller 1970:Figure 22), and therefore represents construction fill associated with the different phases of the Patio of the Altars. Second, an Early Postclassic plate was deposited as an offer ing with Burial #203 beneath Altar 2 (López Alonso et al. 1976: 46-48, Table 11). Of the over 500 burials recovered from the ceremonial precinct, over 90% were Postclassic in date (López Alonso et al. 1976:24; Romero 1937). Structure 1, located approximately 200 m south of the Patio of the Altars, featured Early Postclassic ceramics and was cov ered by later plaza construction (Matos Moctezuma and López V. 1967). The "Altar Mexica" is similar in form to the Altar of the Carved Skulls associated with Stage 4 of the Great Pyramid, and also to pyramid altars from the Southwest Plaza. Based on the information available through published sources, personal observations, and recent investigations, the ceremonial precinct has been continuously utilized for nearly 2,500 years, including its current use as an important religious shrine and pilgrimage site (Olivera de V. 1970). The earliest evi dence for occupation comes from small structures that were later covered over by the Great Pyramid (Miiller 1973; Noguera 1956), but that were built during the Late Formative period. Construction of initial stages of the Great Pyramid occurred in the Terminal Formative period, with both architectural similar ities and contrasts to Teotihuacan styles. There were four major construction stages as the Great Pyramid grew in size and trans formed in orientation, function, and meaning. Associations with nearby mounds and plazas hint at ritual practice, while new construction, modification, and wholesale destruction of ear lier structures made the ceremonial center a complex and dynamic landscape. Active construction programs at the Great Pyramid contin ued into the Early Postclassic period, at which time the focus of Cholula's ceremonial activities shifted to the northwest, where a new ceremonial center was established, probably by newly arrived Tolteca-Chichimeca. This partial abandonment may have included intentional destruction of the final phase of the Patio of the Altars, where the stelae were thrown down and shattered either as the result of ethnic hostilities or perhaps as termination rituals. The unfinished facade of Stage 4 may be the result of an interruption in the building process, or the stripping away of the valuable stone facing for subsequent construction. Although the mound became covered with vegetation, it remained an important shrine through the Late Postclassic period (Rojas 1927 [1581]). Following the Spanish Conquest, the mound became associated with the Virgin of the Remedies, and today the Great Pyramid is the focus of religious activities during the annual fair, when as many as 350,000 pilgrims visit the church atop the Pyramid (Olivera de V. 1970:231). This reinterpretation differs markedly from that proposed by investigators associated with the Proyecto Cholula (Dumond and Miiller 1972; Marquina 1975; Miiller 1978), and repeated in recent culture-historical syntheses (Adams 1991; Suárez Cruz and Martinez A. 1993; Weaver 1993). It is, however, more in line with the earlier cultural reconstructions proposed as a result of the initial phase of investigations (Marquina 1951; Noguera 1954). How, then, does this revision of the archaeological record fit with the ethnohistorical accounts of Cholula? Ethnohistoric documents describe a series of ethnic migrations into Cholula, including the arrival of the Tolteca-Chichimeca in a.d. 1168 (Chadwick 1971; Davies 1977; Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca 1976 [1547-1560]; but see Jiménez Moreno 1966). The Toltecs were ethnic Nahuas from northern Mesoamerica, who dispersed after the fall of their capital at Tula. According to legend, they followed their ruler, Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl, to Cholula on his way to the Gulf Coast. When the Tolteca-Chichimeca arrived in Cholula it was a great city dominated by the Olmeca-Xicallanca (Ixtlilxochitl 1975-1977 [1625]: 1:529-530), an ethnic group with ties to the southern Gulf Coast (McVicker 1985). The ceremo nial center of Cholula was synonymous with the Great Pyramid; Tollan Cholollan Tlachihualtepetl was "Cholula, city of the man-made mountain." The Tolteca-Chichimeca overthrew the Olmeca-Xicallanca and established their own center of political and religious authority in what is now San Pedro Cholula, while the original population continued to live in what is now San Andrés Cholula (Olivera de V. and Reyes 1969; also Carrasco 1971). A new pyramid dedicated to Quetzalcoatl was built in the square (Rojas 1927 [1581]), and the cult of Quetzalcoatl became one of the most influential religious organizations in Mesoamerica.</page><page sequence="13">The Great Pyramid of Cholula Other accounts, even more steeped in myth, relate the ear lier arrival of the Olmeca-Xicallanca in Cholula at the end of the Classic period (Ixtlilxochitl 1975-1977 [1625]: 1:529-530). This was after the age of the quinametin, or giants, who are gen erally associated with the builders of Teotihuacan (Davies 1977:46). There were still quinametin living in the Cholula area, and it was only after they were killed that the Olmeca-Xicallanca were able to build the Great Pyramid. They were led by their priest Quetzalcoatl-Huemac, who taught a religious doctrine of penitence. According to the legend, the world was destroyed at the end of this age, and survivors venerated Quetzalcoatl as the god of wind, building a new pyramid in his honor. Extracting history from myth is a precarious undertaking, but several themes are consistent in these two legends. First, Cholula was the scene of successive ethnic "invasions," involving first the Olmeca-Xicallanca, and then the Tolteca-Chichimeca. Second, the respective pyramids were important symbols of these ethnic polities. The Spanish understood this symbolic significance when they demolished the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl and replaced it with the San Gabriel cathedral. But since the true nature of the Great Pyramid was disguised beneath vegetation, it was allowed to remain standing. The Colonial strategy failed when the Great Pyramid regained its importance as the focus of transformed religious rituals and the annual pilgrimage. The distinct ethnic identities can be found in the different stages of the Great Pyramid. Strong affinities with Teotihuacan are apparent in Stages 1-3. Changes in the orientation of the ceremonial precinct, architectural elements, and material cul ture indicate larger cultural changes in the Epiclassic period that may relate to the arrival of the Olmeca-Xicallanca. In contrast to the ethnohistorical accounts, however, recent investigations at the elite residential compound surrounding the Patio of the Carved Skulls indicates that this transition may have been grad ual, with new elements added to the existing Classic artifact assemblage (McCafferty and Suárez Cruz 1995). The arrival of the Tolteca-Chichimeca at the end of the Early Postclassic prob ably corresponds to the destruction and abandonment of the Great Pyramid. What does the archaeology of the Great Pyramid contribute to identifying cultural interaction? The first major stages of con struction probably took place during the Terminal Formative period, when Cholula was a contemporary of Teotihuacan. Architecturally, the pyramid builders occasionally shared sty listic elements with the Valley of Mexico center, but often they used distinctive styles (e.g., Stage 2A). If style is considered a form of visual communication (Conkey 1990), this might be interpreted as a sequence of shifting statements of affinity in which Cholula fluctuated in terms of political and ideological autonomy (cf. Nagao 1989). The R-106 household provides material evidence for cultural interaction on the domestic level in the Middle Classic period, where similarities in ceramics and figurines indicate stylistic similarities with Teotihuacan, though mortuary practices and the architectural orientation were clearly distinct (McCafferty and Suárez Cruz 1994). By the Late Classic period, however, the geopolitical orien tation of the Great Pyramid changed to reflect greater contact with the Gulf Coast, especially with the site of El Tajin. The use of black painted rectangles on Stage 2G has resulted in the nickname "Edificio Totonaco," in reference to the Pyramid of the Niches at El Tajin (Marquina 1970:41). Gulf Coast influ ences are most pronounced in the Patio of the Altars, particu larly in the use of curvilinear borders on the altar and stela groups (Acosta 1970b, 1970c), and miniature pyramid altars as tombs (Izquierdo 1986). Ceramics and hollow figurines found in association with the pyramid altars also indicate Gulf Coast contact (López Alonso et al. 1976:Figure 54), as does the elab orate burial featuring Maya-style cranial and dental mutilation (Suárez Cruz 1985). The archaeological evidence for Gulf Coast presence in Chol ula therefore supports ethnohistoric accounts of occupation by the Olmeca-Xicallanca (Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca 1976 [1547-1560]; Ixtlilxochitl 1975-1977 [1625], Book 1:530-531). The dramatic polychrome murals found at the nearby site of Cacaxtla provide additional evidence for this ethnic presence (McCafferty and McCafferty 1994; McVicker 1985; Quirarte 1983). The murals combine a variety of regional styles in what Kubler (1980) has described as an eclectic synthesis most simi lar to that of the Gulf Coast Maya. Cacaxtla was identified as an Olmeca-Xicallanca stronghold by Muñoz Camargo (1948:37, in Abascal et al. 1976) in a sixteenth-century account. The later architectural stages of the Great Pyramid featured symbolic elements that also appear as architectural motifs in the Mixtee codexes, including woven mat motifs, polychrome diag onal bands, and greca friezes. Shared systems of symbolic com munication among Puebla, northern Oaxaca, and the Gulf Coast are fundamental elements of the Mixteca-Puebla stylis tic tradition (McCafferty 1994; Nicholson 1960, 1982; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980). During the Early Postclassic period decorated ceramics begin to show evidence of the development of techniques and design motifs relating to the Mixteca-Puebla polychrome tradition. The appearance of Mixteca-Puebla glyphic elements at the Great Pyramid during the Early Post classic period supports the possibility that Cholula played an important role in the development of the style (McCafferty 1994; Nicholson 1982). The question of the religious meanings associated with the Great Pyramid is even more problematic, although this was undoubtedly a dynamic characteristic, changing over time. The symbolic significance of the initial stages of the pyramid remain ambiguous, although the cosmo-calendrical aspects of Stage 2A may relate to ritual control over time and creation, as at the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Teotihuacan (López Austin et al. 1991). The placement of the Great Pyramid over a spring may imply control over terrestrial waters, another parallel to the iconography of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. Feathered serpents were represented at the Great Pyramid during the Epi classic and Early Postclassic periods through stylistic elements such as the polychrome mural on Structure 5A', a large balus trade keystone in the shape of a serpent, and the carved serpents on Altar 2. The association of Quetzalcoatl with Postclassic Cholula is clearly established in ethnohistorical accounts (Durán 1971 [1576—1579]: 133; Rojas 1927 [1581]: 160-161; Torquemada 1975-1983 [1615]: 1:387), as well as iconographically on Cholula polychrome ceramics. The orientation of the Great Pyramid (24-26°) toward the setting sun at the summer solstice suggests another dimension of the symbolic landscape. Since the Pyramid is the highest point on the local horizon, a temple on top of the mound would be the last spot illuminated by the dying sun. Further evidence appears in Durán's (1971 [1576— 1579]:259) description of the Great Pyramid in relation to mountain worship, where he re cords that the Pyramid was used to ascend to a level from which</page><page sequence="14">14 McCafferty to pray to the "Lord of Created Things," that is, the solar deity Tonacatecuhtli. This practice compares well with the traditional association of the Great Pyramid as the "Tower of Babel" (Durán 1971 [1576-1579]:257; Torquemada 1975-1983 [1615]: 1:386), and that still exists in oral tradition. According to Motolinia (1951 [ 1540]: 138), "The plan was to make [the Great Pyramid] higher than the highest mountain . . . [but] God con founded them, as He did those who built the Tower of Babel, by allowing a huge stone in the shape of a toad to fall during a terrible tempest that hit that place." It also provides a concep tual link with the Aztec axis mundi of Coatepec, the serpent hill that acted as a portal connecting the mortal world with super natural realms (Gillespie 1989:87; Heyden 1981). As David Car rasco (1982:135) explains: "The [Great P]yramid was believed to be the opening to celestial forces as well as the covering over the primordial waters of the underworld." The Great Pyramid was identified in the Historia Tolteca Chichimeca (1976 [ 1547— 1560]:9v— lOr, 14r) by seven flowers on the side of the mound. It is also identified by the glyph 7 Flower on Map 2 of the Mapas de Cuauhtinchan (Simons 1968b:65-66, lámina 4). Seven Flower was the calendrical name for the Mixtee solar deity analogous to Tonacatecuhtli and Xochipilli, who was associated with artisans (Furst 1978:164). Lord 7 Flower was also depicted as a prominent participant in a pulque ceremony in the Codex Vindobonensis (Furst 1978:202-203), and there fore may be linked to rituals illustrated in the Bebedores murals (Müller 1972). After the ceremonial center shifted to the new Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl, the Great Pyramid became a shrine for 9 Rain Chiconauquiahuitl (Rojas 1927 [ 1581 ]: 162— 163). Children be tween 6 and 10 years of age were sacrificed on an altar atop the Pyramid to bring on the rain, and annual "fiestas" were held there. In the Mixtee pantheon, 9 Rain was the calendrical name for the female consort of the Rain God, equivalent to the Aztec Chalchiutlicue, goddess of earthly waters (Caso 1979:426). Vey tia (in Simons 1968b:29) recorded a legend that a temple dedi cated to a frog deity identified as the "Goddess of Rain" was built at Cholula. In this light, the colossal head from the Patio of the Altars may have been an altar in the form of a rain deity, perhaps even an anthropomorphized frog. The image of a frog on top of the Great Pyramid in the Historia To/teca-Chichimeca may therefore refer to Chiconauquiahuitl, while the colossal frog altar may be the stone described by Motolinia (1951 [1540]: 138) in his Tower of Babel story. With the Spanish Conquest, the Great Pyramid was trans formed into a base for the shrine of the Virgin of the Remedies, now one of the major pilgrimages of Mexico. This "virgin" was a European icon carried by the Spanish conquistadors, in con trast to the more indigenous Virgin of Guadalupe. Yet the Virgin of the Remedies was quickly adopted into more traditional prac tices, with icons of the virgin emerging from a maguey plant (Durán 1971:230, note 2). This image parallels the Aztec god dess Mayahuel who was often depicted emerging from the maguey plant as the embodiment of female productivity (Sul livan 1982). As the deity associated with pulque rituals, Maya huel may also relate to themes embedded in the Bebedores murals. The Great Pyramid of Cholula is a complex conglomeration of architectural facades and symbolic meanings. By sorting out the archaeological features of the Pyramid it has been possible to reinterpret the construction history of the ceremonial precinct, and thereby revise the cultural sequence for Cholula. Reinter preting the construction sequence enables consideration of the religious meanings and cultural identities associated with the Pyramid at different stages of its history. The interpretations presented can best be considered a tenta tive framework awaiting additional research to fill in important gaps and clarify ambiguities. Future excavations at the Great Pyramid and the ceremonial precinct, as well as within the urban zone of Cholula, will add many significant details and necessi tate subsequent revisions. The goal of this reinterpretation has been to summarize and synthesize the scattered information on the ceremonial center to facilitate further investigations. The rapid urban development of Cholula includes immediate threats to the ceremonial precinct despite ongoing attempts to preserve the archaeological zone, underscoring the urgent need for addi tional research. RESUMEN La Pirámide Mayor de Cholula es la más grande de Mesoamérica y con tinúa siendo un sitio religioso muy importante desde su fundación hace 2,500 años. Pero a pesar de más de un siglo de exploraciones arqueoló gicas, varios problemas fundamentales continúan existiendo en relación a su historia de construcción, funciones religiosas y contextos culturales. Contradicciones entre las interpretaciones arqueológicas y etnohistóricas del montículo han aumentado la confusión sobre la historia cultural de Cholula, y como consecuencia el sitio casi ha desaparecido de las síntesis generales de Mesoamérica. Este artículo reúne información publicada e inédita sobre la Pirámide Mayor para reinterpretar la secuencia de con strucción y el significado del tlachihualtepetl, o "montaña hecho a mano." Los primeros exploradores describieron la Pirámide en el siglo XIX; excavaciones científicas continuaron desde 1930 hasta el presente. Fuentes etnohistóricas de la época colonial describen una serie de "invasiones" étnicas prehispánicas en Cholula, primero por los Olmecas Xicalancas, y después por los Toltecas-Chichimecas. La evidencia arqueológica del Proyecto Cholula fue interpretada como indicación de un abandono del centro ceremonial correspondiente al "colapso" al fin del período clásico. Sin embargo, en la presente reinterpretación de la historia de construcción, la transición clásico-postclásico fue gradual, sin abandono de la Pirámide Mayor hasta fines del postclásico temprano. La Pirámide Mayor fue construida en cuatro etapas mayores, más nueve modificaciones menores. La fase inicial de construcción occurió en el preclásico terminal con Etapa 1A, con medidas de 120 m por lado y 17 m de alto. Esta estructura fue cubierta por Etapa 2A, aumentando a 180 m por lado y con nueve niveles de escaleras en cada fachada. La Etapa 3A probablemente fue la última etapa mayor completada, aun que tiene dos modificaciones (3B y 3C) en el lado oeste. La Pirámide expandió a 350 m por lado, con una altura de 66 m; las fachadas son de estilo talud-tablero muy parecido a la arquitectura teotihuacana. Una etapa final, Etapa 4, cubrió esta estructura previa con bloques de adobe, pero no se encontró ninguna fachada, posiblemente porque esta etapa nunca se terminó de construir, ó porque fue desarmada para reusar las piedras en construcción subsiguiente. La etapa final es del postclásico temprano, y corresponde también con un conjunto residencial en la plataforma noreste de la Pirámide Mayor. El recinto ceremonial que rodea la Pirámide incluye varias otras pirá mides, además de complejos de patios con plataformas, murales, y monumentos grabados. Pirámides al norte y al oeste indican plazuelas,</page><page sequence="15">The Great Pyramid of Cholula 15 aunque muy poca investigación se ha llevado a cabo en estos lugares. La mayoría de exploración occurió al sur de la Pirámide Mayor, especialmente en el Patio de los Altares, donde un serie de estelas y altares grabados están asociados con depósitos del postclásico temprano. La iconografía de la arquitectura, murales, y monumentos grabados indica una secuencia de transformaciones en afiliación política y/o étnica, con etapas tempranas mostrando semejanzas estilísticas con Teotihuacán, mientras que las etapas más tardías tienen razgos del Golfo, como por ejemplo El Tajín. Este modelo, que también ocurrió en la cerámica y las figurillas, corresponde bien con descripciones etno históricas de la dominación de Cholula por los Olmecas-Xicalancas en el postclásico temprano. Los temas religiosos de la Pirámide Mayor son más complicados e incluyen elementos simbólicos del culto solar, lluvia/agua terrestre, pul que, y la serpiente emplumada. La Pirámide Mayor está orientada hacia el poniente en el solsticio de verano (24-26° al norte del oeste), y los glifos caléndricos y documentos etnohistóricos relacionan la Pirámide con dioses solares como 7 Flor (Mixteco) y Tonacatecuhtli (Mexica). La Pirámide está construida sobre un manantial que todavía fue ilustrado en representaciones coloniales cuando la cima del montículo estuvo asociado con la diosa de la lluvia Chiconauhquiahuitl. El mural llamado "Los Bebedores" ilustra una ceremonia de más de 100 individuos en estado de embriaguez ritual probablemente con pulque; el tema del pul que continua con la imagen de la Virgen de los Remedios (patrona de la iglesia cristiana encima de la Pirámide), quien está representada saliendo de un maguey de manera casi idéntica a las ilustraciones precolombinas de Mayahuel, diosa de maguey y pulque. Finalmente, varios monu mentos grabados y un mural representan serpientes emplumadas, que en el postclásico fueron caracterizadas como Quetzalcoatl, el dios patrón de Cholula. La Pirámide Mayor de Cholula es una de las estructuras religiosas más importantes de la Mesoamérica antigua. Este análisis de la arqueo logía, etnohistoria e iconografía ha reinterpretado la historia de construcción y significado simbólico de la Pirámide. El proceso de re interpretación no está completo; en cambio, la necesidad de investiga ciones adicionales es urgente, particularmente en los lugares donde la zona arqueológica está en peligro de desarrollo urbano en Cholula. Cholula debe ser reconocida como uno de los sitios claves de Meso américa, y debe ser reintegrada en los síntesis generales de su evolución cultural. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Support during the preparation of this study was provided by the Mellon Foundation through their Post-Doctoral Fellowship program. This re search has been encouraged by a number of teachers, friends, and colleagues, including Charles Caskey, Carlos Cedillo, Marty Dudek, Ruth Edelstein, Zee Green, Wigberto Jiménez Moreno, Zaíd Lagunas, Michael Lind, Silvia Martínez, Sharisse McCafferty, Eduardo Merlo, John Paddock, David Peterson, Sergio Suárez Cruz, Geraldina Ter cero, and Daniel Wolfman. All have made significant contributions to Cholula's culture history, and the critical mix of perspectives that they provide has generated fresh interpretations for the long-troubled archaeology of Cholula. I am confident that ongoing collaboration with Sergio Suárez Cruz and Mickey Lind will enable further elaborations of the cultural sequence at the Great Pyramid. Sharisse McCafferty pre pared illustrations for this study and provided an invaluable sounding board for ideas and frustrations regarding Cholula. An earlier version of this paper was commented on by John Hoopes, Bill Isbell, Mickey Lind, Randy McGuire, and Ann Stahl. Richard Diehl, Bill Fowler, Joseph Mountjoy, and Barbara Stark provided useful criticism during the review process for Ancient Mesoamerica. Adriana Zavala helped translate the resumen into Spanish. 1 must also acknowledge the impor tant role of Gregorio and the corner table at La Lunita in the reinter pretation of the Great Pyramid. This article is dedicated to the memory of Professor David A. Peterson. REFERENCES Abascal, Rafael, Patricio Dávila, Peter J.
