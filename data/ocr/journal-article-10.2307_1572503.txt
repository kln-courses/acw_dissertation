Printed in Great Britain FURNITURE-INSPIRED SCULPTURE Mike Nevelson* Abstract-The author describes how he came to make sculpture inspired by furniture, in particular, furniture of the American Colonial period. He discusses his psychologicalpreparation for a work and the techniques he used in constructing several of the pieces illustrated. His conceptions of sculptured furniture and furniture-inspired sculpture are presented. I. Some people have called me a sculptor since 1945, when I exhibited wood carvings [1]. I will point out later why I make this statement. I live to make things. Since childhood, making things has been my greatest satisfaction, their plan- ning much less so. The physical act of construction is what pleases me. Therefore, I have never been interested in doing 'conceptual' art, or hiring assistants to do the labour or having my sculpture built in a commercial shop. The sculpture seems to grow under my hand and it is altered by subjective moods, often losing contact with my original vision. I am less interested in the intellectually contrived piece and more interested in the one that comes from my subconscious mind. In this sense, I am not 'making art' but, rather, extend- ing my personality. And what does this personality consist of? My extended personality consists of everything I have experienced in art and in life and, perhaps, atavistic recollections. About twenty-five years ago, I picked up a piece of marble and carved a simplified figure of a pelican, with the belly, head and beak as simple segments of spheres. After it was finished, I looked at its back and it was no longer a pelican but a portrait of a rabbit. The bird's beak became the rabbit's ears, the back of its head the rabbit's face, its back the rabbit's belly and its feet the rabbit's tail. Two things in one has been well explored in art in the past. But I am content to casually accept the phenomenon when it quite frequently occurs in my sculpture as an un- planned happening. I am prone to accept certain things as 'mysteries'. I have always felt that an artist puts himself into his work in the form of crystallized energy and the viewer senses this. Intellectual concepts are for me a minor consideration. For this reason, I have resisted projects that involved hands other than my own (bronze casting and factory-made sculpture) as well as collaborative efforts, for I believe that too many cooks spoil the broth. * Artist living at 3 Milltown Road, New Fairfield, Con- necticut 06810, U.S.A. (Received 10 December 1970.) Direct work in stone and wood seemed right to me. My early respect for the character of a material gave way to purposefully ignoring subtleties of grain for more concentration on total form. I was not a botanist, or a naturalist or a geologist presenting rare species of wood and stone. When a person looks at a sculpture and admires the nature of its material, he does not see the sculpture, for he seeks refuge in talk about the grain of the wood or colour of the stone. What sort of person can view a man-made thing that has a life of its own and not be swept into a flight of emotion ? II. In the late 1950's, I noticed that when I visited a museum my feet took me to the antique furniture section before I got to contemporary painting and sculpture. Gradually, furniture forms started creep- ing into the abstract wooden constructions I was then making. But I did not use found objects or rejects from furniture factories. Rather, I learned to make the forms myself and took pride in my interpretation of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century furniture forms and in the tool skills I acquired. I realize that the fine art of sculpture is not con- stricted by any utilitarian considerations. It has the sole objective of affecting the mind and emotions of the beholder. A sculptor in making a work is only limited by the possibilities of the medium he has chosen. Although I draw on the craft of furniture-making for inspiration, I consider works of this kind fine art objects rather than in the domain of industrial or craft design. The furniture that interested me most was the formal and informal work produced in the American Colonies prior to the Revolution. It was conveniently close at hand and, like a river, I tend to take the path of least resistance. My comments below are based on interviews of old people in Knox county, Maine. They might be called folkloric history. At the time of the English colonization of America, England was a great maritime power. The finest craftsmen built and decorated the ships of the Royal Navy. The carving and gilt on the naval vessels were specified in the construction contract as a percentage 323</page><page sequence="2">Mike Nevelson of the total cost. The decoration was considered vital to maintaining the image of the Empire wherever the flag was shown. Wood was the material for building ships and furnishings, and it was in short supply. Stone homes were popularly considered inferior to wood construction because of the common belief that a stone dwelling induced lung disease. Creative design, at this time, was particularly focused on architecture and furniture. Increased trade with the Orient was influential in Chippendale's adaption of Chinese household furniture designs to British usage. The skilled craftsmen who emigrated to the New World were confronted with virgin forests. Diverse species of wood were available in great quantity. The political revolution, which added to a craftsmen's personal dignity, resulted in a high point in the history of design and technology. This historical period of 1620 to 1845 became the source of my sculptural concepts. The emphasis on utilitarian or functional art like furniture and architecture, and new tool design rather than on fine art, like easel painting and sculpture, was related to the Protestant work ethic and, particularly, the influence of Puritan values on artists, craftsmen and the rising middle class that encouraged them. By the time the Puritans had established them- selves in the New England Colonies, their wilful affiliation to the culture of the ancient Hebrews induced a further denial of figurative painting and sculpture in favour of functional art. The Puritan dogma was carried over into the numerous Shaker communities that were active in producing functional articles of unique design and construction until the beginning of the twentieth century. Few people today realize the diverse influence of the Puritans. The Puritans introduced the Thanks- giving holiday but did not support the celebration of Christmas and, in fact, Christmas was not a national holiday in the United States until just before the start of the American Civil War. The decline of Puritan influence coincided chronologically with the low point in American creative design between 1850 and 1905. I fantasied about the Puritans and partially identified with them. I mentally pictured these stern and pious people in Colonial times, living in thrift and self-denial. They denied decoration of their clothes and their homes. Paint could be used to preserve the structure of their homes but never for the joy of colour. They denied art in the form of painting and sculpture, not only because it seemed frivolous to them, but because figurative art remind- ed them of forbidden graven images and of the pomp of Roman Catholicism. Yet I know that few stable communities from the time of the caveman had existed without some kind of art. True, some nomadic groups lived without temples and sculptures but they had decorated swords and prayer rugs, donkey beads, and decorated canoe paddles and harpoons. The Puritans denied the need for art. How long could this denial con- tinue ? Not long. Art sneaked in the back door. One can imagine that one day a pedlar from Boston came to someone's kitchen door and sold a tall case clock, a 'Grandfather's Clock'-the Puritan dike had sprung a leak. A functional sculpture had penetrated the Puritan stronghold? The Elders might say, 'What do you need it for ? To tell time ? What's wrong with a sun dial or a simple shelf clock ?' But to no avail, for the Grandfather's Clock was kept. The Grandfather's Clock was as tall as a man. It told time in a bellowing announcement of chimes and sometimes played a simple tune. This clock in the abstract shape of a man or of a man in the shape of a clock, had a shining face with a changing expression as the hands moved around and some- times told the phases of the moon-the times to plant and times to harvest. The face was in a head crowned by a bonnet, often with finials like thorns, a long thin waist proper to an ascetic and solid feet placed well apart, determined not to be moved. Almost all furniture has been anthropomorphic, with design based on human or animal shapes and even utilizing a terminology common to both. We use terms like the leg of a table, the knee of a Queen Anne chair, the cabriole leg named and shaped after a goat, the head and foot of a bed, the face and waist of a clock, the skirts of a table, the arm and back and leg and seat of a chair. The mechanical principles of the weight-driven tall clock were excellent but, in fact, in the Puritan community the clocks failed to work well due to lack of lubrication, extreme variations in ambient temperature and humidity, ash and dust clogging the movement and lack of clock repairers. The Grand- father's Clock filled a human need for sculpture- functional enough to pass into the Puritan enclave but since the clock rarely worked, it can be considered a fine art sculpture. It was in the subconscious a male figure, a God figure, a Christ figure. It was the most frivolous, elegant article of furniture in the sparse house. In a short time, another need was filled in the form of a shorter case clock, with perhaps a curve or two, dubbed 'Grandmother's Clock' and, subconsciously, identified with the Virgin Mary. And so unintended idolatry was introduced and the ancient human hunger for sculpture triumphed! III. Although I began furniture-inspired sculpture in 1958, I will first mention three pieces I made later, for they are related to my study of the Puritans I outlined above. My 'Six Secret Puritan Gods' (cf. Fig. 1), over life size, contain battery-driven clocks and music boxes with nostalgic tunes that are activated by opening the drawers. The only varia- tions in the six figures are the grain of wood and the hardware pulls on the drawers. Figure 2 shows 'Head and Shoulders-Secret Puritan God', which is a continuation of my interest in making the functional object the subject matter of my sculpture. 324</page><page sequence="3">Furniture-Inspired Sculpture Fig. 1.

One of my first furniture-inspired pieces was 'Little Fig. 2. 'H wood, , 23 325</page><page sequence="4">Mike Nevelson Fig. 3.

This piece was one of a group called 'The Family' and was shown in 1960 [2]. Here, the rectangular form is relieved by the round, the head and legs having been turned on a lathe. The head is turned from a glued up 'sandwich' block of hardwood core and pine board exterior, pegged and glued to reveal a specific colour and grain pattern when the excess is chiseled away. (This technique is similar to the one described by Mortimer Borne [3].) The shelf-compartmented torso is joined like the traditional 'six board chest' or sea chest, with hand- cut dovetails for structural stability and visual interest. The door, or lid, is stiffened with two cross battens at the ends like a kitchen bread board. The cubic base is likewise pine and dovetailed with top rabbeted into the sides and reminiscent of the bases used to support nineteenth-century Store Indians, bilikins and other store trade signs. I like these references to folk art of the past and feel that work such as this ties in with American history. I would like to point out that I am not working within an art form necessarily confined to this moment in history. I am not concerned with fashion. Fig. 4. 'Little Brother', wood, height 64 in., 1959. What I am doing now might have been done in the distant past, or hopefully it might also be done in the future. I am striving for a sense of timelessness and a type of sculpture that expresses my own personality, rather than the spirit of my time. I do not make furniture, or sculptured furniture or furniture sculpture. I am a sculptor who makes sculptures whose shape comes from interpretations of memories of furniture that originally had an anthropomorphic basis. Figure 5, 'Metamorphosed Cobbler's Bench', illustrates this. The sculpture is made of wood, then painted to erase the identity of the wood, then coated with a mixture of epoxy resin and asbestos fibres and grained to resemble a new species of wood. This procedure is related to the veneering tech- nique of building with a common wood and applying 326</page><page sequence="5">Furniture-Inspired Sculpture Fig. 5.

King, New York, N.Y.). Fig. 7. 'Portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Collector', wood, height 66 in., 1965. with glue a thin layer (standard usage: one twenty- eighth of an inch) of more costly wood or the grain- ing technique of covering a common wood with paint applied to resemble a more costly wood. The uninformed viewer, discovering that the surface is different from the sub-surface, feels victimized by a fraud. Actually, the veneering technique has made something else possible-a more stable structure over wide flat areas and the possibility of using burl and delicatecrotchveneers that could not be success- fully utilized in solid construction. But most interesting is the emotional response the technique arouses in the viewer and its ability to project him into a defensive posture. This is similar to the reaction to the 'gloss over' effect of varnish, as if varnish had the potential to cover a multitude of defects. While there are some who cannot see structure because they are blinded by the shine, surfacing materials like varnish protect and reveal more than they conceal. By giving the wood a 'wet look', grain and colour are revealed and the viewer does not look at the surface but rather into it. The wood cells are seen in three dimensions. The secondary level of interest in the sculpture shown in Figure 5 is its form. This is a sculpture of a cobbler's bench that was formerly a Henry Moore reclining figure that was formerly a cobbler's bench. Furniture historically designed to suit the needs of a particular profession might be considered a tool of 327 ? : .... R .</page><page sequence="6">Mike Nevelson Fig. 8. 'Three Boys', wood and metalparts, height 58 in., 1962. the trade, of which the Cobbler's bench or Shoe- maker's Bench is a classic eighteenth-century example. The shoemakers of that time prefered to sit on a low bench, bringing their knees up and supporting their workpiece in their laps. Many small drawers were desired at the bench in which to keep assorted nails, hammer, skiving knives, sharpening stones, leather scraps, linen threads and beeswax lumps. As the cobbler sat and tended to his cobbling, so also sat the bench on which he sat and, anthropomorphically, it assumed the shape of the sited figure of the cobbler, extremely similar in positioning to Mayan seated figures and to those of Henry Moore. Another type of furniture associated with a profession was the Apothecary Chest. A doctor or pharmacist might be conceived as holding a ware- house of informational tidbits within his body's as does the Apothecary's Chest, whose framed, roomy, deep drawers hold medicinal herbs, glass containers, measuring beakers and other assorted paraphernalia. Figure 6 illustrates one of a series of sculptures I made on this theme, entitled 'Mr. Apothecary'. Since the drawers in the head and 328</page><page sequence="7">Furniture-Inspired Sculpture torso are workable and roomy, it can be considered sculptured furniture. Once I had a dream of building an enormous cabinet with an infinite number of drawers and compartments that would contain a miniaturized history of art from the beginning to the present and, perhaps, predictions of the future also. The dream has not yet become a reality but in the interim I made the sculpture shown in Figure 7, 'Portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Collector'. The meaning of the two heads on the single body is not clear to me. Since I make almost no plans for a work, the result reveals some- thing of my own unconscious to me. I do not like to make complete drawings because I find that creative energy goes into the drawing, leaving the making of the sculpture anti-climactic and pedes- trian and boring. When pulled out, the drawers in 'Portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Collector' reveal nine separate abstract sculptures formed from sawdust and wood shavings molded with plastic resin glue on a wooden armature or core. Most of these sculptures are mounted on rubber wheels to facilitate movement. Since I work alone, I do not like things around me that I cannot handle easily. My sculptures are usually of a shape, size and weight that I can carry and, if larger, are made of separating sections bolted together. As the drawers in Figure 7 are pre-filled with smaller sculptures, they cannot be used for storage. Thus the piece functions only as sculpture and can- not be catagorized as functional sculpture or furniture sculpture. 'Three Boys' (cf. Fig. 8) have characteristics common to American pine furniture and also to wooden boat construction, being a pine board 'skin' screwed to spruce ribs. But beyond this resemblance, they are purely sculpture. The faucets do not work, the boys contain no beer. Their only function is to bring a faint smile to the face of the viewer. REFERENCES 1.
