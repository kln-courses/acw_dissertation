Christianity, Mr. Cupitt believes, is undergoing a moral crisis more far-reaching than any crisis of doctrine.

The main charges are as follows. Christianity is morbid in its asceticism, fundamentally anti-feminist, intolerant in its dogmas and its institutions, destructively authoritarian, and intellectually dishonest. Cupitt is discriminating and judicious in his appraisals. Most, though not all, of the charges strike home, and many Christians have themselves come to confess their validity. Not only, therefore, must they rid themselves of outdated cultural lumber, such as the belief that the created order is hierarchically structured, but they must also rethink their fundamental beliefs from the ground upwards. The morally unsatisfactory and anthropomorphic story of salvation-history must go. So, too, must a two-worlds doctrine, with its sharp distinction between church and world. So, too, must the illusory dream of a single theological orthodoxy. Religion must be morally purged before its proper function can be recognized as the flowering and transformation of our ordinary moral insights. Only then can its true significance be realized, and only then can theological thinking be given its rightful, though limited, place. Peter Baelz Peter Baelz</page></plain_text>
