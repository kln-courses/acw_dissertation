Pos?q: ALBERTI'S THEORY OF PRIMITIVE SCULPTURE "Those [who were inclined to express and represent... the bodies brought forth by nature] would at times observe in tree trunks, clumps of earth or other objects of this sort, certain outlines [lineamentd\ which through some light changes could be made to resemble a natural shape." L.B. Alberti, De Statua1 Art historians sometimes follow trends in contemporary art. Modern artists' interest in spontaneously created images and objets trouv?s for instance, has attracted the attention to the antecedents of this practice. Gombrich has shown that the practice of cloud painting based on amorphous inkblots can be traced to various antique authors' observations of the shapes of clouds and to Leonardo's practical advice on the inspiration which a painter may draw not only from clouds and muddy waters but also from damp stains on a wall.2 The late Professor Janson associated these precetti with Alberti's introduction to his treatise on sculpture, where he sug gests that its mimetic tendency (i.e., the pursuit of human likeness) originated in the primitive sculptors' disco very of seemingly anthropomorphic shapes in tree trunks and clods of earth.3 Although this remarkable theory had some repercussions in contemporary painting, most notably in the forms of ancient trees among which Piero di Cosimo set his scenes from the "early history of man"4, the parallel between the essentially flat acci dental images referred to by Leonardo and Alberti's objets trouv?s is by no means evident, since in fact they involve different kinds of perceptual phenomena. The visual perception of imaginary shapes in clouds and stained walls is basically a mental illusion that may be explained as a Gestalt effect5 while Alberti's observation on the anthropomorphic shapes of trees and clods of earth anticipates the theory of the beholder's empathy with three-dimensional objects. The hap tic experience which may be reinforced by a "set" of intentions and expectations, is described as a spontaneous enrichment of cognitive impressions by subjective data drawn from the repertory of the beholder's earlier physical sensa tions.6 The effect, said to be especially noticeable in sculpture, also occurs in non-artistic contexts. The con cept of empathy, originally defined as intuitive projection of the beholder's inner sensations upon an inanimate object (Einf?hlung or "feeling into"), was in fact proposed by the German philosopher Theodor Lipps as an explanation of the spectator's animistic apprehension of non-representational forms.7 The emphaty-like perception of human appearances in stones and tree trunks is so common an experience that one can easily suppose that it was familiar to Alberti. The haptic suggestiveness of natural rock formations seems already to have been exploited by prehistoric cave artists8 while the evolution of the so-called primitive art styles, especially in African sculpture, is intimately related to the inherent form of tree trunks. This influen ce is most strongly evident in the ancestral posts that were normally carved out of freshly felled trees (before the wood hardenes)9, but the fact that such sculptures were sometimes found in groves implies the use of li ving trees. Though the wooden memorials are seldom more than a few decades old, their adherence to a venera ble tradition is confirmed by much older stone fetishes whose trunk-like forms imply that they follow ancient wooden prototypes.10 Alberti's theory of the role played by trees in the history of sculpture is also supported by the stylistic analysis of early Greek statuary, suggesting that as with the African fetishes, figures carved in marble were copied from earlier models carved in wood (xoana).11 However, since Alberti's knowledge of antique sculpture was presumably restricted to Roman art (or Roman copies of Hellenistic statues)12 one must infer that his concept of the earliest representational sculpture evolving from tree trunks was not derived from Archaic or other types of primitive wooden sculpture. Like all humanists Alberti relied on classical literature to broaden his perspective of antique art, but the seminal role that he attributes to natural objets trouv?s diverges from the more rationalistic opinions of the classic authors. Quintilian and Pliny ascribed the evolution of artistic mimicry to the copying of cast shadows, a procedure that according to Pliny was also the source of sculptorial realism (N.H.35:151-152). Alberti's con cept of the wooden origins of sculpture may however be related to another text in Pliny, who in discussing of the various kinds of trees, says that in primitive country places a tree of exceptional height may be dedicated to a god, and that the oldest images of the deities were carved from trees (N.H. 12:1). Janson suggested that Alberti's theory was the result of an arbitrary association of Pliny's information about the antiquity of wooden sculpture with the same writer's remark on the suggestiveness of clouds (N.H. 2:61).13 He also pointed out that the humanistic interest in chance images is reflected in some clouds painted by Mantegna14, while a more direct reference to suggestive tree trunks may be seen in an anthropomorphic tree, perhaps representing Daphne in the role of Mater Virtutum in the same artist's "Expulsion of Vices from the Grove of Virtue".15 The arbo real personification of Virtue is also related to a Hypnerotomachia Poliphili woodcut ascribed to the school of</page><page sequence="2">A.W.G. Pos?q /Alberti's Theory of Primitive Sculpture A. Mantegna (?), Monster Roughly Car ved in Wood. Woodcut, in: Hypnerto machia Poliphili, Venice 1499. Mantegna, showing classical nymphs metamorphosed into trees.16 The famous humanistic textbook, which ac cording to some scholars, is the final version of an earlier draft inspired by Albert! and presumably composed at the time when he was writing his treatise on sculpture17, may therefore provide some additional insight into the origins of Alberti's concept of the evolution of primitive statuary. The strong impact of Alberti's enthusiastic study of the Antique is very obvious in the Hypnerotomachia illustrations, many of which depict imaginary classical monuments.18 One of these is a woodcut showing a squared shaft with an "ithyphallic sign" supporting a three headed bust adorned with acanthus leaves which, according to the text, represents "a gilt monster roughly carved in wood" (Fig. I).19 Although the term mon ster (monstro), means a fantastic or irrational apparition, in the Renaissance it was frequently used as a synonym for a primitive pagan idol. As such it recalls prophet Isaiah's passionate diatribe against idolatry, where he describes a "carpenter" who having carefully selected a cedar, a cypress or an oak, fashions it into "a graven image after a figure of man" which he then beseeches as his protector (Is. 44:33ff.). A humanist would no doubt associate Isaiah's description with the criticism of idolatry in one of Horace's Satires where a sacred statue declares: "Once upon a time I was a fig-wood stem, a worthless log, when a carpenter doubtful whether to make me [into] a stool or a Priapus, chose that I be god."20 The fashioning of a priapic idol out of a fig tree, a traditional emblem of fecundity, whose soft wood is easy to carve, suggests a primitive type of sculpture. The god who in remote antiquity was worshipped in tree trunks roughly hewn into a body21 was even believed to have the capacity of transforming human beings into trees. According to Ovid, he exercised his power turning nymph Lotis into a tree (Met. 9:355ff.). The "archaic" character of the Hypnerotomachia "monster" is implied by the three heads, which probably allude to its apotropaeic intent22, but its composite structure recalls the memorials which the Romans erected to commemorate famous writers and philosophers, setting their effigies, sometimes with two faces facing in opposite directions, on vertical shafts that seem like incomplete human bodies lacking arms and feet. The shafts</page><page sequence="3">382 A.W. G. Pos?q I Alberti's Theory of Primitive Sculpture commemorating male personages sprouted in the middle, a male member which in antiquity was considered a vestige of a pre-classical (i.e., primitive) phallic cult. The author of the Hypnerotomachia alludes (on the same page) to a Greek herm dedicated to Mercury (Hermes), who according to classical writers was associated with Priapus and venerated by phallic monuments called hermae in his honour.23 The tapering shaft in the Hypne rotomachia illustration even suggests familiarity with a distinctive type of marble herm which in the Renaissance was sometimes represented as the focus of priapic rites24, but the fact that the description explicitly states that the "monster" was carved in wood shows that Alberti, or the later writer who used his draft, must have been aware that before their adoption in honorific Roman portraiture primitive wooden herms vaguely remini scent of the human body were worshipped as idols. This idea is to some extent supported by the fact that in Italian the truncated body of a herm would be called tronco (trunk) which means both a human torso and a tree trunk.25 Wooden columns were also erected to Dionysus, whose myth features various phallic allusions, including a fig tree phallus that the god consecrated to mark his resurrection.26 The legend was later evoked in Dionysian rites by decorating his herms with branches and greenery. Representations of such herms in Greek vase painting (Fig. 2)27 have some affinity with the Hypnerotomachia illustration where the "antique" foliage presumably alludes to the ithyphallic statue's association with the cult of anthropomorphic trees. All this allows one to contend that the author of the Hypnerotomachia not only recognized in the hybrid form of Roman herms a vestige of a pre-classical tree cult but also that he perceived in the seemingly incomplete bodies of the marble monuments a suggestion of a hypothetical transformation of trees into human figures. Thus when Alberti wrote about primitive statues being fashioned from tree trunks he had the antique herms in mind ? in the hybrid form of the Roman portraits he recognized not only a vestige of the primordial tree cult but also an artistic formula that preserves a vestige of a suggestive natural form from which it evolved. Since the role which Alberti ascribed to the evocativeness of tree trunks arose from his observation of surviv ing Roman herms together with a careful study of the classical writers, his aethiological theory of the origins of sculpture may be recognized as a case of penetrating art historical insight, or rather as creative empathy motivated not by the chance suggestiveness of natural objects but by the cognitive "set" of intellectual curiosity about an unusual type of antique statuary. Alberti's concept of the "chance image" was therefore essentially different from Leonardo's practical precetti ? not only is the perception of imaginary forms in tree trunks an emphaty-like experience rather than a merely visual one, but the reference to tree trunks was itself inspired by works of art. Further, since Alberti's observation was not meant to be used in actual artistic practice, it also differs from the modern artists' effective use of spontaneously created images and objets trouv?s. 2 Villa Giulia Painter, Dionysian Cult Scene.

Pos?q I Alberti's Theory of Primitive Sculpture 17 Francesco Colonna is said to have been responsible only for the 1499 editio princeps published in Venice by Aldus Mantius. The Hypnerotomachia authorship has been questioned by various scholars, who have suggested that the text was originally written by somebody else. The names which have been mentioned in this context include, besides Alberti, also Eliseo Giani, Giovanni Campano, Pico della Mir?ndola, Lorenzo de' Medici and another Francesco Colonna who was the Roman prince of Palestrina and Zagarolo; cf. Pozzi, in Pozzi/Ciapponi (n. 16), vol. II, p. 3. One of the hypotheses states that the first, presumably Latin, draft was composed about 1467 by an anonymous humanist, tentatively identified with "Polyphilo", whose work may subsequently have been elaborated by Alberti. According to another version "Polyphilo" is the pseudo nym of Alberti's friend Cardinal Prospero Colonna, but the text itself is a result of a collaboration between three erudite authors: Leon Battista Alberti, Lorenzo de' Medici and Prince Francesco Colonna; cf. E. Kretzulesco-Quaranta, Les Jardins du Songe, Paris 1976, pp. 418-425. Alberti died in 1472, his unfinished treatise on sculpture is now considered as later than his books on painting (written in 1435) and architecture (1452) and is tentatively dated to the middle sixties (1464?). See: M. Picchio-Simmonelli, On Alberti's Trea tises on Art and Their Chronological Relationship, in: Italian Studies Annual, Toronto 1971, quoted by F. Borsi, Leon Battista Alberti, Oxford 1975, p. 304. 18 In addition to Mantegna, or perhaps his workshop, the illustrations have been ascribed to various Renais sance artists including Botticelli, Bertoldo di Giovanni, Leonardo and also Alberti himself, cf. Kretzulesco Quaranta (n. 17), p. 421. 19 "...Uno monstro rudemente exciso in ligno et inaurato, effigiato humano vestito dal tricapo fina alla diaph ragma solamente; il residuo, in quadrato acuminantise alla parte infernate demigrava in una gulatura basiale cum uno lastrello cum una antiqua foliatura nel sito brachiale, cum uno pomo al pecto; et nel medio dil quadrato nella parte piu lata appareva lo ithyphallio signo...", in: Pozzi/Ciapponi (n. 16), vol.

A three-headed personification depict ed by Pisanello on the reverse of his medal of Lionello d'Est? dated to 1440-1444, has been interpreted as an allegory of Prudence, or as "a defender of peace and prosperity", cf. G.F. Hill, G. Pollard, Renaissance Medals, London 1967, p. 8, cat. 6. 23 H. Marwitz, s.v. "Hermae", in: Der Kleine Pauly, Munich 1979, vol. 2, p. 1065; P. Devambez, s.v. "Her mae", A Dictionary of Ancient Greek Civilization, London 1970, p. 235; see also H.J. Rose, CM. Robertson, s.v. "Hermes", in: The Oxford Classical Dictionary. According to Herodotus (2.51) this type of monument was imported into Athens from the Pelasgians. Modern scholars have compared herms with the Babylonian boundary posts (kudurru), cf. W. Buckert, Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth, Berkeley 1983, p. 58. 24 One of the Hypnerotomachia woodcuts depicts a priapic sacrifice of an ass before a phallic herm, described in the text as rude simulacro del hortulano custode, which alludes to Priapus as guardian of gardens, cf. Poz zi/Ciapponi (n. 16), vol. I, pp. 188f. The text refers to the herm as lano (Janus) implying some familarity with two-headed Roman herms, which were known to Renaissance artists, see: E. Mandowsky, C. Mitchell, Pirro Ligorio's Roman Antiquities, London 1963, pp. 87-88, cat. 71-81. A similar herm also appears in Pirro Ligorio's sketches of a pseudo-antique gem with a scene of a priapic cult, cat. 140-140. 25 The association between human and tree trunks and the tronci mentioned in Alberti's treatise on sculp ture, has been proposed as an explanation of Mantegna's allegory of Virtue; cf. Janson (n. 1), pp. 259f. The association between fig trees and ityphallic idols also survives in the Italian fare la fica, an obscene gesture of a closed fist with the tumb tucked between the first and second fingers. On the cognizance of the expression in the Renaissance see: J.A. Phillips, Michelangelo's Eve in the Sistine 'Temptation', in: M.M. Gedo (ed.), Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Art, 3, 1088, pp. 24-27. 26 Although Dionysus himself was never represented as ithyphallic the phallus was carried as his symbol in the "phallophoria", cf.
