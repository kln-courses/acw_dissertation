<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Creed of Abstract Painting LLOYD GOODRICH IN NO OTHER art has there been so revolutionary a change of viewpoint as to its very nature, as in paint ing in the last century. Up to fifty or seventy-five years ago, one of the chief aims of Occidental painting ? al though not by any means the only one ? was representa tion. Art which represented the greatest subjects was generally considered the most worthy of attention. To day a large part of the art world holds the opposite view. The old masters were all to some extent what are now disparagingly called "literary" artists. Whether they told the Christian legends in pictorial form, like the earliest painters, or whether like the Renaissance artists they broadened their horizon to include the re-dis covered classic world, or like the realistic Northerners painted portraits, landscapes, and scenes from the life around them, they were all fulfilling the artist's im memorial function of creating pictorial representations of the religious concepts, the legends, stories, events, peo ple, or things, that were of most interest to themselves and their public. This tradition of "literary" subject matter was continued into the early nineteenth century by David, Gericault, Ingres, Delacroix, even Corot. Not un til the middle of the century was it seriously challenged. The causes behind the change in attitude were too vast and complex to be more than suggested here. Reli gion was yielding to science. Social dominance was pass ing from royalty and aristocracy to the middle class. The dominant ideology was becoming increasingly scientific, materialistic, democratic. The artist's position in society had changed; the Church had long since ceased to be his 42</page><page sequence="2">ABSTRACT PAINTING 43 greatest patron, and now aristocracy was failing him. Their place was taken by a plutocracy and public whose taste was on a far lower level. Hence the genuinely crea tive artist was tending more and more to become an ex treme individualist, without the social function or posi tion of his predecessors. Most of the subject-matter of the past ? religious, classical, romantic, or historical ? was too remote to have a vital meaning for the artist. And modern ideology offered no worthy substitute. Science had shaken religious beliefs and the romantic sense of the importance of the individual, but had substituted no equivalent system of thought or faith. Whereas the Christian and classic leg ends had lent themselves readily to pictorial treatment, being in physical, anthropomorphic form, scientific ideology seemed too abstract and impersonal to be easily expressed in pictorial terms. Moreover, the machine age was beginning. Printing had already taken away some of the artist's literary func tions. Now came photography, which competed with him in the field of representation ? portraiture, the recording of events, descriptive pictures of things for all kinds of useful or sentimental purposes. And eventually the mo tion picture, which could enact a complete visual drama instead of picturing only one phase of it, was to take over his function of popular story-telling. And by the mid-century there was a rising flood of mediocre popular painting, designed for the taste of the new bourgeois public. These works, in which the great themes of the past were reduced to the level of anecdotes, travelogues, costume masquerades, and bar-room nudi ties, filled the salons, rivaling in photographic verisimili tude the camera which was so soon to replace them. The result of all this on the genuinely creative artist</page><page sequence="3">44 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW was to narrow his subject-matter, and make him concen trate on purely esthetic elements, in which neither the printed word nor the camera nor the anecdotal painting, could rival him. The beginnings of this attitude were seen in Courbet. "Painting is an art of sight and should concern itself with things seen," he said. "It is a wholly physical language, and an invisible or abstract thing is not within its province. Our grandiose painting is a con tradiction of our social conditions, our church painting of the spirit of the age. It is an absurdity for painters to trot out subjects in which they have no real interest and which are appropriate to a time and place remote from our own. It is far better to paint railway stations, engine houses, mines, and factories. These are the saints and miracles of the nineteenth century." Since Courbet, the greatest creative artists have seldom painted "literary" subjects in the sense that Delacroix and Ingres did. They have turned for material to the life around them, or to such non-literary themes as landscape and still-life. They have looked at life less for its philo sophical or dramatic or poetical meanings, than for its sensuous qualities of form and color. Their personages have not been actors in dramas, but ends in themselves. Cezanne and Seurat introduced a further stage in the suppression of subject, by considering figures and objects not as images with human associations, but almost purely as forms. With them we have the beginning of the trend towards abstraction, which has been one of the most marked tendencies of our time ? the tendency to elimi nate the associative values of the subject, "purify" paint ing of everything but its intrinsic physical qualities of form, color, line and texture, and to organize these ele ments into design which shall appeal as directly to our senses as does sound in music.</page><page sequence="4">ABSTRACT PAINTING 45 One result of this tendency was the emergence of still life as a major theme. Still-life appeals to the modern artist for many reasons. It has no literary connotations, and few human associations. It is a purely physical sub ject-matter, presenting objects of varying sensuous quali ties. It is completely under the artist's control, unlike the esthetically unruly outer world. And it involves no at tempt to picture the immensely complex life of today. Cubism is in a sense a form of still-life art, for its most frequent subject-matter ? when it can be said to have any ? consists of the physical properties of familiar ob jects, used as motifs for design. It is the abstract school of painting par excellence, with the minimum of associative content, and with little effort to create even an illusion of recession. It is the logical carrying-out of part of Cour bet's philosophy, and in fact some of its proponents look back to Courbet for their origins. The modern "pure" esthetic has been expressed in English most brilliantly and persuasively by the late Roger Fry. Although not an out-and-out abstractionist, Mr. Fry was opposed to any element of "literature" in painting. He believed that not only is there seldom co ordination between literary and formal elements, but often actual conflict, and that too much concern with the subject may injure an artist's formal qualities. He wrote: "Pictures in which representation subserves poetical or dramatic ends are not simple works of art, but are in fact cases of the mixture of two distinct and separate arts." Every age fashions for itself the esthetic best suited to its needs. This purist theory, one can see, is the response of the modern artist to the conditions of his time; it is his attempt to separate the elements in art that seem im portant to him, and to reject the rest. But if we examine it, in a somewhat longer perspective, as a statement of</page><page sequence="5">46 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW objective fact, we will find little in the history of art, or in what we know about artists, or in the works themselves, to justify such a thesis. The supreme masters of the Renaissance achieved a formal completeness which has never been equaled since; and they were also supreme as imaginative artists. No one has pictured the Christian legends more dramatically and forcefully than Giotto. No one has achieved a more majestic fusion of the Christian and classic worlds than Raphael and Michelangelo. No one has painted the earthly paradise more magnificently than Titian and Rubens. No one has portrayed the individual human be ing more profoundly than Rembrandt. Their works will always remain in men's minds as the supreme pictorial embodiments of some of man's highest concepts. In such art there is little evidence of any lack of co ordination, or actual conflict, between subject and form. On the contrary, these artists most frequently achieved formal triumphs when they were handling themes of the most significance for themselves and their public. Great themes in the hands of great men led to great design. Would anyone seriously contend that Michelangelo was not interested in the meaning of the vast epic which he unfolded on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, or that to Rubens his nymphs and satyrs were so much "significant form?" Not until the decadence do we begin to feel a per functory attitude towards subject; and this was paralleled by a loss of vitality in form. This is not to say that the subject is the most important element in painting. Rather it is the raw material out of which the artist creates something which does not exist in the real world, and which, for want of a better term, we can call art form. In the great works of the Renais sance this art form existed in combination with many</page><page sequence="6">ABSTRACT PAINTING 47 other elements, not isolated as in the work of the modern abstractionist. The creation of art form I believe to be the artist5s highest function. But I also believe that the sub ject and its representation have been in the past, and will probably continue to be, the path by which the artist achieves the greatest formal significance. The subject, although an essential factor, is only one of many factors that lead to the creation of art form. The artist must first have the creative gift. The theme must lend itself readily to plastic treatment. And the artist's attitude towards it must be such as to move him to crea tion. In general, subjects that have the greatest associa tive value for the artist are most apt to inspire him to plastic creation. On the other hand a theme may some times be valuable to an artist not so much for itself as for the opportunity it gives him to express his own sense of life. Though it may not enlist all his belief, it may serve as an open door for the entrance of related subject matter that is of vital meaning to him. Such seems to have been the case with religious themes for some of the Renaissance artists. In Rubens' religious works, for example, the dogmas of the Church seem to have served less as subjects than as pretexts. Nor do great themes, unfortunately, always create great art. In the high Renaissance the classic world was a very real and living thing. But since then thousands of academicians have painted the most elevated classical subjects without achieving a spark of the vitality that Rembrandt embodied in the head of a beggar. Rembrandt was discovering for himself themes close to his own inter ests. Subject-matter, like everything else, has its cycles ? periods when it is discovered or re-discovered, when it has a vital meaning and plays a living part in the creative processes of artists; and then periods when it loses this</page><page sequence="7">48 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW vitality and becomes mere empty rhetoric. Thus its cycle parallels that of form, both being aspects of that growth and decay that run through the history of art. An artist's conception of his subject is apt to be of a piece with his formal conceptions. It would be difficult to name an artist who had created great formal art while revealing a banal or sentimental attitude towards his subject. There is after all a distinction between good and bad literature in art. Nobody would defend J. G. Brown's shoe-blacks as literary art, but only the person blinded by prejudice would deny that the Sistine Chapel is among other things great literature. In the minds of too many exponents of modern theory, the great literary art of the old masters has been lumped indiscriminately with the bad literary art of the salons. From the spectator's standpoint there is no reason why the subject-matter of painting should not be considered a legitimate source of its appeal. Far from being a hin drance to the appreciation of form, it would seem to be the natural means of leading the beholder from the emo tions of life into the purer contemplation of art. Instead of an "impurity" it is an enrichment of the total value of the work. To try to exclude it is to run counter to a fundamental human instinct. It is true that subject-matter loses some of its meaning with time, whereas formal qualities remain intact. But here we might make a distinction between specific and generalized subject-matter. The former would be the particular theme ? the story, scene, person, or object, with all its actual details; the latter would be the more universal human elements underlying it. To Rembrandt's sitters and their families the question of likeness must have been of lively concern; but we today are more interested in his revelation of character. The specific details of</page><page sequence="8">ABSTRACT PAINTING 49 classic myths or mediaeval dogmas may have little mean ing for the modern spectator; but they still symbolize profound human experiences and desires. The greatest artistic themes have, beneath their particular aspect, this quality of universal significance, which remains even after their specific meaning fades. The relative importance of specific subject-matter in the various arts might be summed up as follows: in prose literature, all-important; in poetry, a little less so; in painting and sculpture, still less; in music, least of all. Thus the plastic arts could be placed between literature and music in this respect. Comparisons between music and painting, made to justify the theory of abstraction, are misleading. Music is not a purely absolute art; certain forms, such as opera, vocal music, or program-music, have specific subjects; and even in more absolute forms the composer himself by his title often indicates that he had in mind something in the real world. And in all music there is a deeper, more unconscious subject-matter ? all our knowledge and emotion ? a subject-matter far more generalized than that of painting or literature, but nevertheless part of our experience of reality. To say, as Clive Bell does, that "to appreciate a work of art we need bring with us nothing from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no famili arity with its emotions," is not true even of music, the most "abstract" of the arts. Mr. Bell, incidentally, does not tell us how this idiotically blissful ignorance is to be achieved. The comparison between music and painting is mis leading on another account. The real world offers more to the visual artist than to the musical composer. Ob jects by the fact of their existence possess substance, form, and color; but few of them possess voices. The normal</page><page sequence="9">50 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW condition of nature, audibly, is comparative silence. But visually nature offers the artist an infinite variety of form and color. Hence the difference between natural sounds and music is much greater than that between visible reality and art form. It is because nature offers so little specific subject-matter to the musical composer, that he is freer to express his more generalized subject-matter. This does not mean that art form is a copy of natural form; it is something as distinctly creative as musical form. But on the other hand it is not unrelated to nature. It is an outgrowth of natural form, the sum of all the artist's experiences of reality, transformed into esthetic terms. As soon as a line, tone, or color is put on canvas, it creates a sensation of projection or recession. As soon as projection or recession are created, the resultant forms, in so far as they possess body and substance and complexity, suggest those of the real world, and become images. And these images have not only intrinsic values, but associa tive values; so that associations come crowding in, whether we want them or not. This has much to do with the fact that most abstract paintings have been com paratively flat and geometrical, resulting in patterns of superimposed flat planes, like Japanese prints; or at the most, in a species of bas-relief. None of these modes em ploy the deepest and most powerful resources of painting ? the creation of solid forms in deep space. Thus ab stractionism, by excluding the associative values of im ages, denies itself the most profound plastic values. In general it has created magnificent decorative art, among the most vital products of our time; but not art which ap proaches the depth and power of the great masters of the Western tradition. And even in art not stricdy "abstract," the theory of</page><page sequence="10">ABSTRACT PAINTING 51 "pure" esthetics, by limiting the artist's subject-matter, tends to impoverish rather than enrich his formal sense. The human figure as a subject has more to offer the artist than still-life. Quite aside from its associative values, on a strictly plastic plane it offers the most subtle, com plex, and dynamic organism in all of nature's forms, stimulating most powerfully those sympathetic physical sensations out of which vital and moving design is cre ated. To a greater degree than any other kind of subject, it has the power to arouse in the artist the highest formal response. And outside of this physical appeal are all its infinite associative values, not the least of which is the element of sex, one of the motivating forces in all art. The theory of abstract art was a logical result of the artistic conditions of our time, and it made a definite contribution to modern esthetics. It cleared the air. It made us conscious of the diverse elements in a work of art, and of their relative value. It purified art of much that was irrelevant, trivial, and vulgar. It killed the merely story-telling picture, and the merely descriptive picture whose chief purpose was representation. It restored a healthy delight in the purely physical appeal of painting. It liberated the genuinely creative artist for more esthetic ends. We know now that the camera can never compete with the artist in the creation of art form, and that the instinct to create art form is perennial, and cannot die unless all the arts die with it. And it helped to create and make intelligible some of the most original art of today. Most of what it accomplished, however, was due to its value as a fighting creed rather than as a statement of eternal verities. Its contribution has been made, and its present value is less than doubtful. Any modern esthetic to be valid must take into account many more aspects of the human mind.</page></plain_text>
