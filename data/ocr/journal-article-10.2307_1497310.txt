<plain_text><page sequence="1">Further Notes on Snake Yarns SAM HINTON LLOYD N. JEFFREY'S ARTICLE, "Snake Yarns of the West and Southwest," which appeared in the October, 1955, number of Western Folklore (Vol. XIV, pp. 246-258) is an interesting and informative study, bringing together in single compass, as it does, most of the misconceptions about snakes that constitute the bulk of herpetological lore. The discussion of such misconceptions, to be sure, is worth while from the standpoint of folklore, but it is of even more value from the point of view of science; hence my brief extension on Mr. Jeffrey's paper. In his article there were one or two modern misconceptions. I realize that in calling attention to these I run the risk of introducing more "facts" which later research will prove to be superstitions--but it's all part of the game. LocoMOTION Snakes really do move almost exclusively by "winding or twisting," or what Dr. Mosauer has called "lateral undulatory movement."' This movement may be roughly summarized as the passing down the body of a succession of lateral curves which, meeting resistance on a rough substrate, are translated into for- ward motion. The straight line, or "caterpillar" type of locomotion, is limited to heavy-bodied snakes who are not in any hurry. The expression "walking on their ribs" is a pleasant metaphor, but conjures up a false picture of the ribs' being used as movable legs. Actually, the ribs serve as anchors for a wonder- fully complex set of overlapping muscles, and their movement is slight. For- ward travel of the snake is effected by moving the broad scutes of the belly forward and back in successive waves; as they are pulled backward, their sharp rear edges dig in so that the body is pulled forward. Each of these scutes is indirectly connected with two ribs; the inferior costocutaneous muscle ex- tends aft past several scutes to attach near the tip of a rib. The superior cos- tocutaneous is attached near the lateral ends of the scute, and leads forward for some distance, attaching near the center of a rib. As Dr. Clifford Pope has pointed out, snakes may use both methods of loco- motion at one time;2 it appears easy for them to "trot in front and gallop be- hind." But lateral undulatory movement is the most important method used. 1 Walter Mosauer, "On the Locomotion of Snakes," Science, LXXII (1932), 583-585. 2 Clifford H.

A small, warm, and angry rattlesnake, facing downhill on rough ground, may well strike with such force that the impetus will carry him for more than a body length. A fine motion picture of this occurrence was recently taken by Mr. Norman Wake- man of Pasadena City College; a red rattlesnake, Crotalus ruber, is clearly seen to sail completely out of the picture in striking at the photographer's assistant. Such a strike is, of course, without accuracy, and an alert person could dodge it fairly easily. CORAL SNAKES It has long been something of a mystery to me that there are not more coral- snake bites. The species is not rare in parts of East Texas (I caught twenty-one in the summer of 1934, in Houston County). And far from calling "... almost any vividly colored serpent of unknown species a 'coral snake'... ," most of the East Texans that I knew, at least up to 1937, were unaware of the coral snake's existence. Many completely harmless snakes are thought to be deadly, but the deadly coral snake is often thought to be harmless. For example, a friend in high school tossed me a coral snake, right on the front lawn of Crockett High, and I was teased for months because I, the Great Know-it-all Snake Expert, dropped it and backed away; and that snake tosser never did believe me when I insisted the critter was poisonous. In my freshman year at Texas A8cM College I had a lot of snakes at the Science Hall, including a few coral snakes. Dr. Raymond Berry and I were horrified one day to discover that one of the coral snakes had been removed from its jar, and the lid carefully replaced. We feared the snake would be used for a typical Aggie joke, and placed in someone's bed. Apparently, however, our frantic announcements in the Mess Hall and in the daily bulletin worked; at least, no coral-snake bite was ever reported. Another time at A&amp;gM, a senior came into the Science Hall proudly bearing in his hand a small coral snake that he had picked up on the rifle range. He was quite frightened in retro- spect when, after having dropped the snake into a box, he learned what he had captured. One of the few bites on record occurred near Beaumont, Texas, when a group of Boy Scouts failed to recognize a coral snake, and passed it from hand to hand for fifteen minutes before it finally became impatient and bit one of the boys. The boy recovered, but the bite was nearly fatal. I met several Negroes who knew the coral snake as the "thunder snake," and recognized its poisonous qualities. None of my other East Texas friends, however, seemed ever to have heard of such a thing.</page><page sequence="3">170 WESTERN FOLKLORE SUICIDE IN POISONOUS SNAKES A snake, painfully wounded or held down with a stick, may bite savagely at the stick or at the site of the wound. Of course, the anthropomorphic notion of "suicide" is not to be considered; but it is not correct to say that a snake is immune to its own poison. Snakes in general are more resistant to injec- tions of snake poison than are warm-blooded animals, but they are neverthe- less susceptible. Pound for pound, it takes about ten times as much rattlesnake poison to kill a snake as it does a man; but even a big rattler is a lot smaller than a man, and an average rattlesnake bite will contain an effective lethal dose for another rattlesnake. And it makes no difference whether a snake bites himself or another snake, the poison works just as well." TWO-HEADED SNAKES Mr. Jeffrey's explanation of the possible origin of tales about this monster is a logical one. There are also a couple of other possibilities. In the western United States, the rubber boa (Charina bottae) has been called the two-headed snake. The same is true of the old-world boas of the genus Eryx, and for the same reason; these snakes have such blunt tails that both ends look alike. While neither is found in Texas, it raises the possibility that a snake with an amputated and healed-over tail might have started the story. Another possibility is that a genuine two-headed freak snake might have been seen. One of the most popular exhibits in the San Diego Zoo at present is a two-headed California king snake named Duplex, who has lived at the zoo for more than two years. It is very doubtful, however, that Duplex or any other snake like him could have survived for very long in the wild. Erroneous beliefs about snakes and other things are sometimes incorpo- rated into frank tall tales, and it is hard to tell just how much of his own tale a speaker may believe. For instance, the glass "snake" ("j'int snake" in Houston County) has figured repeatedly in the story of a man who experi- mentally hid a piece of the broken snake in his pocket. The snake, true to his reputation, tried to join together again, and cast about for the missing section; not finding it, he finally hitched up to a corncob and went on off. The latter part of this story is never believed, and I don't know how much of the first part is. The hoop-snake tale has fared the same way, with some of the stories end- ing when the rolling snake crashes into an innocent tree, impaling it with its deadly tail; the tree promptly curls up and dies. Mr. Jeffrey mentions the erroneous belief that rattlesnakes can puncture automobile tires; in East Texas, this feat has been elevated from a mere 3 A. A. Nichol, Volney Davis, and Llewellyn Peck, "On the Immunity of Rattlesnakes to Their Venom," Copeia, 1933, No. 4, pp. 211-213.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON SNAKE YARNS 171 fallacy to a full-fledged tall tale. A run-over rattlesnake bit the offending tire in anger; the stream of air issuing from the puncture thus produced and blowing into the snake's face made him madder still, and he began to hiss. The hiss, of course, re-inflated the tire past its capacity, and it exploded with such force as to blow pieces of that snake's rattles clean through a corrugated iron barn door 150 yards away.... There is in Texas a serious (that is to say, believed) version of the story of the lethal fang imbedded in the boot and poisoning several wearers; it has the fang imbedded in an automobile tire and killing a filling-station attendant as he checks the air pressure. One more very interesting belief should be added to Mr. Jeffrey's lore con- cerning the rattlesnake's rattle. This is the notion, widespread throughout the south, that a set of rattles tied to the sound post inside a fiddle will improve the tone of the instrument. I once had a fiddle, made somewhere near Beau- mont, which was so equipped; if the rattle is really efficacious, I shudder to think how that violin would have sounded without it! Recently, here in La Jolla, I saw a guitar with a set of rattles tied inside the body (a guitar has no sound post). This guitar was obtained in Spain by Mrs. Peter Nicoloff, and it was not originally provided with rattles; they were placed there later by a Mexican guitar teacher in Los Angeles, who assured Mrs. Nicoloff that all good musicians in Mexico are aware of the improvement thus effected.
