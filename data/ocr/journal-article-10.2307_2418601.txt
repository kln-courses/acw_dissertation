In the last decade, research interest in the areas of plant reproductive ecology and evolution have bur- geoned. Some of this growth is a logical outcome of the extension of biosystematic investigations to in- clude examination of the breeding systems, pollina- tion biology, and dispersal of related taxa. Some of the interest has also been sparked by explorative re- search in the tropics and by the conjunction of the fields of population ecology and genetics. Many zo- ologists have discovered also that plants provide an appropriate group in which to test concepts that have been more extensively studied in animals. Both of the books reviewed below reflect the application of sexual selection theory to plant evolution as well as current interest in the ecology of reproduction in plants. Plant Reproductive Ecology is intended as an introduction to this field for advanced undergradu- ates and graduate students. Mate Choice in Plants ex- plores the adaptive significance of reproductive events and attributes that relate to mating in plants. It is a theoretical treatise that will be of interest to bota- nists, sociobiologists, and evolutionary ecologists in general. Both books are decidedly speculative by in- tent (i.e., see quote from T. H. Huxley in Willson and Burley and both preface statements) providing an ex- cellent source of ideas for future research and stim- ulating the reader to look beyond traditional ap- proaches and interpretations. After all, we all need a bit of "shaking up" from time to time to avoid en- trenchment. In both texts, the authors have combined current ecological concepts with information from a broad array of specialized subfields, such as embryology and genetics. Included are discussions of polyem- bryony in gymnosperms, the genetic basis of self- incompatibility and the genetic determination of sex expression. In addition, I found only a very few ty- pographical or spelling errors despite the broad in- formation base and the frequent use of scientific names for documentation purposes. Use of "Amen- tiferae" as an order in plants is unusual since this taxon is no longer considered to be a cohesive phy- logenetic unit. Plant Reproductive Ecology is divided into four chap- ters that treat, respectively, the life history ecology, sexual expression and breeding systems, pollination biology and sexual selection, and the seed biology of plants. The subdivisions within each chapter are use- ful, enabling the reader to pick and choose among topics of interest and to locate appropriate informa- tion quickly. Both a general and a taxonomic index are included; each chapter has a separate literature cited section. However, students unfamiliar with the terminology will find it important to read the chap- ters sequentially. Definitions are generally given only as a concept is introduced and no glossary is provid- ed. The author sometimes refers the reader to fuller discussions of a concept but "below" is often many pages later. I did not encounter parenthetical state- ments that would refer a reader back to an earlier definition (though the index works well when need- ed). A few terms (e.g., geitonogamy) were neither defined nor indexed. The first chapter on life histories begins with an excellent introduction that not only outlines the im- portance of life history patterns but also details the difficulties inherent in studies of their adaptive fea- tures. It emphasizes that natural selection acts on in- dividuals that allocate resources so as to maximize fitness. This fitness is discussed as a function of age at first reproduction, "clutch size," and frequency of offspring production in semelparous and iteroparous species. Readers will appreciate periodic footnotes relating terms to Greek mythology as well as the oc- casional use of clever vernacular phrases in other sec- tions of the book. Except for the consistent and in- tentional use of behavioral or anthropomorphic terms, these early sections are well written and logically organized to facilitate comprehension. I question, however the argument that the use of "clutch size," "mother," and "parental care" is necessary to avoid complicated verbiage as the author has argued. A typical undergraduate, for example, would readily comprehend a statement that fitness (as described above) is determined by the age of first reproduction, offspring number, and the frequency of offspring re- production. By contrast, "clutch size" has to be de- fined (p. 7) in the paragraph following the statement and is readily understandable only to those familiar with avian or vertebrate ecology. Similarly, "seed- ling" is a very adequate one word substitute for "ju- venile" and is part of the vocabulary of most biology undergraduates. Also, "parental care" should be de- fined for plants when it is used. Perhaps one should argue instead that the use of teleological terms facil- itates comprehension by sociobiologists and verte- brate ecologists who may choose to read the books reviewed here! The costs and scheduling of reproductive effort are explored early in the text using mathematical as well 375</page><page sequence="2">376 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 10 as written constructs. (Graduate students may want to consult other sources for comprehensive mathe- matical treatments.) Willson also makes some very good points about the importance of using appropri- ate measures of reproductive allocation. The chapter closes with sections on some controversial aspects of the evolution of senescence and on plant life cycles. However, life cycle diagrams are highly simplified though the intent was to treat complex life cycles; interestingly, the life cycles of seed plants are not even included. There is also little or no discussion of the relative adaptation of sporophytes and gameto- phytes to terrestrial environments even though near- ly half a page is expended on the question of why plants lack a larval stage. The question itself seems unnecessary and the explanations given are simplis- tic from a botanical viewpoint. One must admit, though, it falls within the stated domain of specu- lation! Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the possible evolution of sexual gametes and the adaptive advan- tages of sexual reproduction. The sections on sexual expression and sex ratios are useful in bringing to- gether as a readily accessible unit some recent liter- ature examples. Two tables provide summaries of def- initions or literature sources. Some definitions differ from traditional practice, however, and this section as a whole needs more careful explanation and elab- oration for students who may be unfamiliar with both the concepts and terminology used. Also, the sug- gestion that dioecy is prevalent in insect pollinated species is frustrating when the evidence cited in ta- bles and text simply demonstrates that many tropical dioecious plants are in fact insect pollinated. (Most insect pollinated plants are hermaphroditic.) Some readers will undoubtedly find the information on fern antheridogens of interest. It is unfortunate however that only Willson's review is cited, with no credit given to original investigators or to pteridologists who have published earlier reviews (e.g., Naf). The sec- tion on selfing versus outcrossing is brief and devot- ed primarily to a discussion of chasmogamy versus cleistogamy. Incompatibility systems are treated but with insufficient attention to differences in the tim- ing of action of typical gametophytic and sporo- phytic systems and to the possibility of interspecific incompatibility between related species. The initial sections of chapter three treat pollina- tion and fertilization from the standpoint of sexual selection involving male (pollen) competition and female (ovule/embryo sac/ovary) choice. Though evidence for the occurrence of some aspects of sexual selection in plants is meager, recent studies (e.g., Bookman) indicate the potential is clearly there. Much of the information provided is a distillation of the content found in Willson and Burley, resulting in a nice complementation between the two books. Many readers will find certain concepts and terms confus- ing (e.g., the distinction between genetic quality and complementarity, "investment in zygotes," parage- netic). Remaining portions of chapter three provide a very useful summary of recent literature in the area of pollination ecology. Many of the topics should interest students who will appreciate the omission and reworking of technical jargon into a more read- able form than is available elsewhere. For botanists these sections are a useful introduction to literature studies of the more unusual forms of vertebrate pol- lination. Coverage of topics is not always equivalent to the amount of information available (e.g., only one case of extrafloral nectaries is cited) or to the impor- tance of the topic (e.g., minimal discussion of the relationship of pollination biology to reproductive isolation). The effect of herbivory on floral biology is only briefly mentioned in other contexts. How- ever, the overall approach in this chapter is a refresh- ing change from the usual pattern. The last chapter is comprehensive, including treat- ment of seed size in relation to germination, estab- lishment, predation, and dispersal. Seed composition and the protective mechanisms developed by plants to avoid herbivory are discussed extensively as are the varied adaptations of seeds and fruits for dis- persal. In many ways, this chapter is the most read- able segment of the entire book. It also provides a wealth of ideas for students looking for projects of interest in areas that need further study. Despite some of the criticisms levied above, I high- ly recommend Willson's book to those interested in plant population or community ecology, sexual se- lection, or the reproductive or evolutionary biology of plants. As is apparent from my comments above, the level of the book is clearly geared primarily to graduate students and botanists with some prior knowledge of plant reproduction and evolutionary ecology. Undergraduates will have difficulty with many sections, making the book unsuitable as a text at that level. Plant reproductive ecology in relation to hybridization and apomixis are also not included though certainly other books are already available on these topics. I think most readers will find the book provocative, interesting, and very informative as a reference on many topics. Readers should find ave- nues suitable for additional investigation but should be aware that a variety of alternative explanations exist for some phenomena other than those provid- ed. Many of the interpretations throughout the book are biased toward sexual selection and, understand- ably, toward the importance of adaptation in re- sponse to natural selection as opposed to chance or random events. It is also unfortunate, though not surprising, that there seems to be a bias toward orig- inal literature by Willson and her close colleagues and students. Though much of her work and that of her students is impressive, other important pub- lished papers have sometimes been ignored (e.g., re-</page><page sequence="3">1985] REVIEWS 377 search on fern antheridogens) or heavily criticized, while sometimes controversial papers or unpub- lished papers and comments by Willson and others are included or incorporated in a less rigorous man- ner. As an example, the pollen donor hypothesis in Asclepias has been questioned by several investi- gators. More recently, pollen limitation has been suggested by Morse and Fritz for Asclepias syriaca as opposed to nutrient limitation presented as fact in chapter 1 by Willson. Also, at times the distinction between animal and plant examples and between theoretical and empirical studies cited as evidence is not clear. Still, the attention to important details that have sometimes been ignored and the assimilation of information from a variety of disciplines is evi- dent throughout the text. I suspect few would be courageous enough to attempt discussion of some of the topics included, particularly with advance knowledge that certain viewpoints would not be popular. As stated earlier, the book as a whole is well worth reading. Mate Choice in Plants by Willson and Burley ex- plores in depth the possible arguments and evidence for sexual selection in plants, including possible pre- zygotic and postzygotic mechanisms. It approaches the events surrounding pollination, fertilization, and embryo development with a view towards demon- strating that even segments of hermaphroditic plants may function as "males" or "females," exercising forms of sexual selection similar to that originally described by Darwin for animal populations. The success of the staminate function (i.e., "males") in terms of the contribution to future generations is considered to be limited primarily by the number of successful matings whereas fitness of the "female," or pistillate function, is argued to be limited by nu- trient resources. Thus, males may compete for fertil- ization sites within ovules and females may exercise choice over pollen nuclei and or embryos of different genetic constitution. In cases where the supply of pollen limits seed production, these processes would not generally be operable. Though the evidence for some of the processes described by the authors is by admission virtually nonexistent, I found the book stimulating as an exploratory thesis. In addition, some points made in earlier papers on sexual selection in plants by Willson and other authors were explained in enough detail that the logic and potential validity of their assertions were clarified. However, some as- pects of sociobiological theory as applied to plants remain enigmatic and/or problematic. In addition, I yearn for the day when someone will take the initia- tive to tackle the entire issue of "mate choice" in plants and write a clear, well-documented paper that also uses the traditionally accepted botanical termi- nology for the processes described. I find the anthro- pomorphic language confusing and at times very misleading. For example, "female" can refer to a pis- tillate plant, an individual carpel or ovule, the atten- dant embryo sac, or only the egg cell. That's quite a mix of gametophytic and sporophytic components! Similar problems surround the use of the terms par- ent and mother, in particular. Willson and Burley have organized the informa- tion and arguments for their thesis by first providing an introduction to concepts of sexual selection, sib- ling competition, parental versus mating investment, and gene versus individual selection. The term "mate" is clearly, though broadly defined in terms of part- nership and shared parenthood, but a more straight- forward definition of mate choice would be useful. Kin selection, parent-offspring conflict, and parental manipulation are also described with appropriate at- tention to considerations of fitness and genetic relat- edness. Even so, most botanists will find the discus- sion muddied somewhat by the terminology and by the necessary reliance on examples and concepts based on zoological literature. Inclusion of some of the equations that relate the variables discussed for the- oretical constructs might have also clarified the re- lationships described for kin selection and sexual se- lection. Later chapters discuss the limitations to male and female reproductive success as described above, the mechanisms by which pollen competition and fe- male choice are effected in plants, and the potential implications of prezygotic and postzygotic choice in gymnosperms and angiosperms. Evidence for re- source limitation of seed production is gleaned from the forestry literature and focuses on the effects of nutrient addition, competitive release, and defolia- tion or withholding of nutrients on reproduction. Shifts in resource allocation as a result of prior re- production were also discussed. Cases of possible pollen limitation of seed production, however, are treated as exceptions to the rule even though the summary table lists 14 cases of clearly positive incre- ments in seed set (+) and a slightly smaller number of cases (13) where seed set was reduced or unaffect- ed. The importance of determining whether or not increased seed set affects seed production in subse- quent years is stressed. The authors also recognize that pollen limitation is possible during some sea- sons or in some populations, even though the gen- eral condition is one of resource limitation. How- ever, it seems likely that the combination of extensive genetic variation and environmental modification of expression are likely to preclude any kind of general observation for plant species. Selective fertilization on portions of a plant might also be possible even though the plant or population as a whole might be pollen limited. With respect to mechanisms, "females" could po- tentially choose among available male gametes/ga- metophytes based on genetic quality or complemen- tarity or on the basis of mating investment by males,</page><page sequence="4">378 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 10 i.e., the amount of energetic, nutrient, or other re- sources contributed by the male gametophyte to the resulting zygote or seed. Differences in pollen com- position and size are cited as supportive evidence that the latter mechanism is at least possible. Both prezygotic and postzygotic detection mechanisms might be used, though effective prezygotic mecha- nisms are considered to be limited primarily to an- giosperms. In addition, rates of zygotic abortion might be different in years of high quality versus low qual- ity pollen. Clearly, most of the discussions are highly speculative and the authors can expect some strong criticism of the arguments included in this section and in subsequent sections that argue for nuclear and cytoplasmic control of zygote development by both male and female gametophytic components. Evi- dence for nuclear control is largely limited to studies of animal cells, but Willson and Burley note that RNA blockage by zygotes occurs in Gossypium; that ribo- somal RNA, microtubules, and plastids from male ga- metes enter the egg during zygote formation in some plants; and that destruction of egg cytoplasm occurs in at least one gymnosperm. The consequences and implications of alternate pathways of sporogenesis and gametogenesis are contrasted and interpreted in relation to the evolutionary origin of double fertil- ization and the function of endosperm. Kin selection is thought to have had a possible role in the evolu- tion of double fertilization. Other mechanisms for female choice include de- lays between pollination and fertilization and poly- embryony, both of which are especially prevalent in gymnosperms. Delayed fertilization might also re- flect male control, particularly if the zygotes of late- fertilized ovules are aborted less frequently than those with early fertilization dates. The contrasts provided in comparisons of life cycle events for gymnosperms and angiosperms are particularly interesting and are developed further in a later chapter. A flow chart model summarizes the mechanisms and conse- quences of mate choice in these two plant groups. In gymnosperms, postzygotic mechanisms prevail, in- volving comparisons by females of the "quality" of embryos developed by simple polyembryony. The production of multiple sperm by single pollen ga- metophytes might enhance male fitness in such gym- nosperms. In contrast, Willson and Burley contend that prezygotic detection is more common in flow- ering plants. Postzygotic mechanisms, including abortion of zygotes are also likely under conditions of environmental uncertainty, permitting adjust- ments based on resource availability. The final chapter of Mate Choice in Plants develops a "map" that groups related hypotheses on the basis of their centrality to the thesis of sexual selection in plants. Evolutionary ecologists should find this sec- tion useful in developing research projects that could be used to test a cluster of similar hypotheses. Aster- isks are used by Willson and Burley to denote test- able hypotheses. Unfortunately, some of these are not clearly testable. For example, it would be difficult to demonstrate whether resource or pollen limitation of female reproductive success is more common in natural populations of plants (H4) because one can- not feasibly sample a sufficient number of species or populations within a species at enough points in time and in the absence of confounding variables. To be testable, the hypotheses need to be more specifically defined and constrained. However, such restrictions might limit their usefulness as springboard sugges- tions for those who wish to further explore mate choice in plants. In addition, the authors provide a very well-written set of concluding paragraphs that highlight experimental needs in problematic areas. This section is very readable and not confounded by the usual jargon used in discussing sexual selection. We botanists thank you! In conclusion, I would recommend Mate Choice in Plants to all biologists with an interest in the evolu- tionary basis of the events surrounding pollination, fertilization, and embryo abortion in plants. Willson and Burley have generated a thought-provoking compendium of information and ideas that should stimulate future research in the years ahead. The preponderance of sociobiological language limits readability and comprehension and the absence of substantial supporting evidence will restrict the gen- erality and ultimate usefulness of the ideas proposed, but both of these problems were anticipated by the authors and should not prevent incorporation of the book as part of the personal libraries of many bota- nists. If nothing else, one can appreciate the home- work involved in researching the topic. Some will undoubtedly make use of the summary of the repro- ductive traits of gymnosperms provided as an appen- dix.-SUSAN R.
