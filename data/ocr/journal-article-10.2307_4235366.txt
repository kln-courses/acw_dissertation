<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Chimpanzee Politics Albert Somit Office of the President Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Illinois 62901 First, some preliminary remarks. Many readers of this journal will be concerned, for purely scientific reasons, with the extent to which the second topic mentioned in the subtitle, "Power and Sex Among Apes," receives sufficient treatment. Out of a coll?- gial regard for that concern, I paid careful attention to this question as I went through the book. I can report that there is a full chapter entitled "Sexual Privileges," as well as smatterings elsewhere. I can also report that de Waal does not cater to the prurient: the discussion of chimpanzee love life, and certainly the accompanying pictures, will more than satisfy any normal scholarly interest in the subject. Second, I should mention that I already had some previous knowledge of de Waal's work. Glendon Schubert and I organized a colloquium, while we were at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Research, at which Jan van Hooff, de Waal's senior research associate, described his project and his initial findings (Schubert and Somit, 1982; Somit and Peterson, 1980). We subsequently visited the Arn- hem Zoo, where the chimpanzee colony was housed, during the early spring of 1979. That visit, as will be seen, has admittedly colored my views. Third, I am not altogether comfortable with the summary of the book provided the reviewers and the readers of this journal. The summary is excellent as far as it goes but it is deficient, I feel, in one important respect. It does not convey the remark- able extent to which de Waal regards chimpanzee behavior as purposive, premeditated, and planned. Some flavor of this is seen in such observations as "whole passages of Machiavelli seem to be directly applicable to chimpanzee behavior" (p. 19); "... endless series of unobtrusive social maneuvers leading up to the dethronement of the leader" (p. 23); and "chimpanzees never make an uncalculated move" (p. 42). Before I offer any critical remarks, I would like to make it perfectly clear, as a formerly dominant Great Ape was wont to say, that de Waal has written an excellent book. This is a first-rate piece of work. In fact, it may well be, as another reviewer has said, "the best book ever written on the social life of apes in captivity" (McGrew, 1983). But it is precisely the limitations implicit in the last three words which give me pause and to which I would first like to address myself. My remaining comments will deal, as might be expected, with the implications for human ethol- ogy of de Waal's findings (or, more precisely, of his interpretations of his data). Since other contributors to this discussion will likely make some of these same points, I will be as brief as possible. My major reservations are methodological in na- ture. They are inherent in what I would call the unnatural (or artificial) aspects of the research de- sign and the setting in which the study was con- ducted. Zoo-based animal research apparently has some inescapable limitations. To begin, the areas in which the chimpanzees lived, and in which their behavior was so meticu- lously observed, were several magnitudes smaller than would have been the case in the wild. During the winter, the apes were confined to indoor quarters, totaling less than 5,000 square feet. The rest of the year they lived out-of-doors in a two-acre enclosure. The behavioral consequences of this forced contact and intimacy hardly need comment. As de Waal writes (p. 26): The day the chimpanzees leave their winter quarters is the most festive day of the year. In the morning the keeper opens the trapdoor lead- ing to the open-air enclosure. The apes cannot see what is going on from their sleeping quarters, but they can distinguish all the trap- doors in the building by ear. Within a second the whole colony reacts with a deafening scream. They are let out into the open air in small groups. The screaming and hooting continues. All over the enclosure apes can be seen embracing and kissing each other. Sometimes they stand in groups of three or more jumping and thumping each other excitedly on the back. The apes' delight in regaining their freedom is obvious. Their black coats, which have grown thin during winter, will become thick and shiny again within a few months. Pale faces will regain their colour in the sun. And, most important of all, the tension, which has been bottled up all winter, will dissolve again in the open air. I find it difficult to believe that the unrelenting intimacy compelled by these constrained quarters did not significantly affect the chimpanzees' social</page><page sequence="2">212 behavior. My own impression, when I observed the colony indoors, was that of a pervasive morbid tension and apprehension, punctuated by wild screaming outbursts and displays. Assuredly, the tensions mentioned by de Waal lessened once the apes were out of doors; that they "dissolved" and left no lasting impact strikes me as most unlikely. Even the outdoor quarters do not permit the type of withdrawal, let alone escape, possible in the wild. This undoubtedly explains why, as de Waal writes of a period of conflict which occurred in the summer of 1976, "three or four times a day all hell broke loose" (p. 106). Overall, he calculates, male-male conflicts occurred once every five hours (p. 185), with aggres- sive incidents twice as common indoors as out (p. 26). Comparable data for free-living chimpanzees are apparently not available. A second "contaminating" factor, no less ines- capable, was that apes were provided with food. Here, I simply quote the author (p. 25): In order to get enough to eat, wild chimpanzees have to spend more than half their time foraging. Since they do not need to do this in a zoo, they will inevitably be slightly bored. The result is that their social life becomes intensified. They have more than enough time to "socialize." In addi- tion, their quarters are limited, so they can never completely isolate themselves from the group. The results are especially marked during the winter months. To avoid the problems experienced at the Holloman Airforce Base chimpanzee colony?which spreads over twenty-five acres?the Arnhem apes were split into ten small groups, each fed in its sleeping cage (the chimpanzees slept indoors throughout the year). A necessary measure?but with what behav- ioral consequences? The size and composition of the colony also differed considerably from that found among free- living chimpanzees. The Arnhem group, de Waal notes, is small "compared to chimpanzee communi- ties in the wild" (p. 82) although it does fall within the range other students have reported. There is some ambiguity about the male-female mix. At one point it is compared favorably with a wild group (p. 82); at another, de Waal suggests an initial shortage of adult males, commenting that it took three to four years before the Arnhem "colony came to resemble groups of chimpanzees in their natural state, where males form separate bands and spend a great deal of time in one another's company" (p. 120). I am troubled, further, by the deliberate "interven- tions" which had far-reaching behavioral conse- quences. On at least two occasions, the researchers removed the dominant chimpanzee?in one in- stance, a female, in the other, a male (see, for example, pp. 58-59, 138-139)?actions which re- suited in profound, long-term changes in the group's power structure and relationships. Finally, there is the manner, noted earlier, in which the data are interpreted. The author is unabashedly anthropomorphic. Many of his explanations and con- clusions, he declares, "are anthropomorphism in its purest form" (p. 54; see also pp. 29-32 and espe- cially the chapter on "Chimpanzee Personalities"), i appreciate his frankness?but that does not lessen my reluctance completely to accept his interpreta- tions of chimpanzee behavior and motivation. None of this, let me hasten to say, means that de Waal is far off the mark when he insists that male? and perhaps female?chimpanzees play politics in a deliberately calculated and consciously self-serving fashion. In fact, he is probably more right than he is wrong. Nonetheless, given the methodological prob- lems and?e Waal's readiness to see the worst?i.e., to believe that chimps act much as we do?I think his findings are best viewed as tentative and prelimi- nary, subject to subsequent testing and corrobora- ron. Let me now turn to some of the implications for human ethology generally, and for "biopolitics" in particular, of de Waal's research. To keep this section tolerably brief, I will deal only with a half dozen of these findings and, for the same reason, only mention, rather than discuss, conclusions I find particularly significant. Here, I will accept his inter- pretation of the data as valid and simply warn the reader that the points made below carry the unwrit- ten prefatory clause "according to de Waal." 1. "The roots of politics are older than humanity" (pp. 211-212). In his foreword, Desmond Morris interprets this to mean that "we are closer to our hairy relatives than was previously held to be possi- ble" (p. 14). No doubt. But I believe that de Waal is saying something quite different?i.e., that our hairy relatives are closer to us. 2. Females play an active and, compared to most treatments of life among our evolutionary forebears, a surprisingly significant political role. At Arnhem, for one phase of the group's existence, the dominant chimpanzee was a female. Even when she was replaced by a male, the females (a) held the balance of power, determining which male was to be domi- nant; (b) often intervened to lessen the intensity of conflict between the contenders; (c) served as peacemakers and mediators; and (d) attesting again to the small distance between that species and our own, deliberately instigated strife among the males. 3. Chimpanzees, and males in particular, display a constant striving for higher status. This "... hanker- ing for power itself is almost certainly inborn" (p. 190). One consequence of this perpetual quest is</page><page sequence="3">213 that chimpanzee social structure has an inherent tendency toward instability and destabilization. 4. Coalition formation is probably the manifesta- tion of a "political instinct." Similar behavior has also been observed among baboons and gorillas. 5. Despite the free-wheeling nature of their ama- tory life and the obvious fact that male chimpanzees have no knowledge of their progeny, "there are strong indications that chimpanzees avoid incest of their own accord" (p. 165). (This topic provides one of the rare instances where de Waal treats his material in "sociobiological" terms.) 6. During episodes of tension, challenge, and intimidation, chimpanzee males avoid looking at each other; during periods of reconciliation?and they show a great need for this, no matter how intense the rivalry?"they look each other straight and deep in the eyes" (p. 113). Perhaps the most important implication of all, however, is methodological. This volume distills data gained by several years of carefully planned re- search and a systematic recording of what was seen, when, and under what circumstances. Etholo- gists, de Waal emphasizes, must be "first and foremost patient observers" (p. 31). But observation alone is not sufficient: It is necessary to be completely familar with the many individuals, their respective friendships and rivalries, all their gestures, characteristic sounds, facial expressions and other kinds of behaviour. Only then do the wild scenes we see actually begin to make sense (p. 32). This is clearly the strength of his method; it is also, as I have noted previously, one of its major dangers.

Wilson Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983. Pr?cis Written for a lay audience as well as the specialist, this book discusses Lumsden and Wilson's posited evolutionary process of gene-culture coevolution. This process "is a complicated, fascinating interac- tion in which culture is generated and shaped by biological imperatives while biological traits are si- multaneously altered by genetic evolution in re- sponse to cultural innovation" (p. 19). The authors* main postulate is that "certain unique and remark- able properties of the human mind result in a tight linkage between genetic evolution and cultural his- tory" (p. 20). Chapter 1, "The Fourth Step of Evolution," presents the basic theories to be elaborated later in the volume. It also discusses evolution, primarily the evolution of the human mind. Chapter 2 introduces sociobiology and outlines the controversy which has surrounded that approach to the analysis of social behavior. Chapter 3, "The Rules of Mental Develop- ment," explores the development and potential of the mind with an emphasis on epigenetic rules, those regularities of perception and information processing which stem from the particularities of human biology. The following chapter traces the development of the human mind from Homo habilis to Homo sapiens. Finally, there is a lengthy discus- sion of the relationship between heredity and cul- ture, followed by a call for "the deep scientific study of the epigenetic rules" (p. 184). ?Carol Barner-Barry</page></plain_text>
