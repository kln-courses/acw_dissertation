<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXVI, No. 7 MARCH 28, 1929 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY NATURE AND CONVENTION D ISTINCTIONS recognized abstractly are often forgotten in the presence of a living subject-matter, or what is perhaps worse, erected into radical oppositions so that the existence of nature as well as of successful inquiry is made a mystery. The history of thought is replete with attempts to lay the universe on the procrustean bed of one of several elements of analysis. Whether nature is a unity or a plurality, a flux or an unchanging whole, temporally complete or un- finished, whether haphazard or whether there is determination in her manifestations, are a few of the more obvious themes upon which speculative thought has played its variations. But the striking reso- lutions of problems of this genre have usually pointed to the false antitheses or exclusiveness of the premises, and have attempted to render justice to the complexity of the subject-matter as well as to its unity, by softening the oppositions of dialectic dissonances. For a philosophy which renounces every claim to dictate the characters nature should possess, and which pretends to nothing more than the description of discovered traits, it is a sound maxim to renounce as well habits of analysis which convert distinctions that are the achieve- ment of an inquiry into "necessary conditions," for the existence of the subject of inquiry, or which interpret such distinctions as imper- meable walls by means of which a plurality of traits are irrevocably separated. Recent work in the sciences has brought into prominence the im- portance of initial agreements, particularly as to measurement, for the subsequent formulation of physical theories. Indeed, not the least important of the morals to be drawn from the recent scientific revolution, is the fundamental role of definition.' There have not been lacking the most radical interpretations for this condition. For some, the inescapable function of the "human foreground" and an abhorrence of anthropomorphism in science, has been made the ground for waving aside individual perspectives on nature as illusion, and for inviting a dumb adoration of her incomprehensible processes. For others, the dependence of the generality of physical theories upon ' Cf. excerpt from letter from Einstein, in Logos, X, 1921, p. 354. 169</page><page sequence="2">170 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY particular modes of investigation has fortified a sensationalistie em- piricism, and the disruptive alternative between nature and conven- tion has been invoked with as mueh vigor as in antiquity. "Die Tatsachen sind das 'Naturliche,' die Theorien die 'Kunst,' " writes Petzoldt. And, of course, the ease with which "mind" has always been called upon to account for whatever needed explanation, has found its echo in the theory which makes the creative activity of mind the source of the diversity of nature. Flailure to hold on to the distinction between what is particular and what is relational, between what is taken for granted and what is to be demonstrated in a given context, is bound to produce diffi- culties. Fuilure to remember that categories like individuality and continuity are distinctions in analysis, and that 'in rerum natura each demands the other, is sure to cause confusion. It is the object of this paper to show that some difficulties may be escaped by a recognition (1) that agreement upon the matter of inquiry, that is, some form of specificity, enters into all cases of knowledge, (2) that arbitrariness of approach has a restricted scope and reduces itself to the recogni- tion of an ultimate diversity in the nature of things, (3) that knowl- edge of nature is possible precisely because there are more or less isolable fields for inquiry, and (4) that particularity or specificity, and generality or connectiveness, are distinctions within a subject- matter, not irreconcilable oppositions. I Attempts to arrive at first principles have been too often exercises in proof by reductio ad absurdusm when for logical analysis a genetic psychology has been substituted, and when in the course of analysis logical primitives have been introduced which are tantamount to a repudiation of the subject-matter of the inquiry. The history of epistemological theories, which in the last century culminated in a widely accepted agnosticism as to the reality of the external world, is the record of fallacies of this order. In much contemporary thought, too, the quest for a doctrine which would make "valid" the procedure of science has led to the impasse of a dualism of "hard," psychologically primitive sense data utterly disconnected and un- attached, on the one hand; and a relational complex known inde- pendently of the conceptually impoverished perceptual elements, on the other. The difficulties experienced in "building up " the external world, which presumably was the source of the problem, ought to indicate that to use wholesale scepticism as a method for discovering the truth, is hopelessly vain. As a matter of fact, of course, whenever an inquiry is going on there is taken for granted a large body of knowledge, which in that</page><page sequence="3">NATURE AND CONVENTION 171 inquiry must remain unquestioned. One of the early methods of determining the elementary electric charge, for example, assumed among other things a relation known as Stoke's Law connecting the velocity and size of a falling liquid drop, a law which was subse- quently shown to be invalid for the circumstances of the experiment. It need scarcely be said that the modifications introduced to correct the law took for granted other relations unquestioned in the new context. Indeed, when one takes a definite case of the acquisition of knowledge as the starting point for an epistemology, the usual dis- tinctions involved in discovering how valid knowledge (in general) is possible, are recognized as artificial, extraneous to the demands of the actual process of inquiry. The attempt to derive knowledge from sensation, or the converse foLly of trying to foist an a priori relational structure upon sensations, results from a failure to realize that no inquiry is significant unless framed in a wider realm of ac- credited knowledge. Laws taken for granted at one stage of investi- gation are, of course, not sacrosanct, and may be revised; but the revision can be performed only if other uniformities are used with some confidence. The road to truth is not a marble stair where security of position is guaranteed by a single well-laid foundation. It is a treacherous, unblazed path where security of step is never guaranteed, and where whatever assurance is obtained is secured by the interplay of m-any elements, independently founded, seldom linearly dependent. Wihat are the logical elements in scientific inquiry ? In a relatively complete science, such as mechanics, it is possible to set up a formal list of definitions and axioms, and to elaborate these without any ap- peal to experiment more geometrico. It is too readily overlooked that apart from a reference to existent physical objects ultimately defined denotatively, such an axiomatic is a branch of pure mathe- matics, and becomes mathematical physics only by virtue of an "in- terpretation" which assigns empirical objects and empirical asso- ciations between them to the terms and operations of the formal scheme. From the point of view of the completed deductive system, the assignment of certain objects rather than others to the terms of the theory is arbitrary, while from the point of view of objects di- vorced from any relational scheme the fact that objects do "satisfy" any scheme seems a mystery. The connection between empirical objects and terms of a physical theory rests, of course, in the fact that in so far as we think of objects it is not in their brute immediacy that they are objects of knowledge, and that in constructing physical theories the relations which physical objects bear to one another are the models for an analogy.2 2 Campbell, Physics, p. 129. Cf. also Gonseth, Les Fondements des Mathe- mnatiques, Chap. 7.</page><page sequence="4">172 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY MIany years ago Peirce made clear that our ideas are to mean all the experimentally verifiable consequences which follow our acting upon them. Since Peirce was bred in the laboratory and since his philosophy was largely a crystallization of scientific method, it is not surprising that critically conscious scientists should have, independ- ently, voiced a full-throated endorsement of many of his positions.8 In great detail N. R. Campbell has shown that terms in common usage as names for objects, depend for their significance upon veri- fiable uniform associations between certain qualities, and that apart from the existence of such associations or laws within the domain where these terms find their application, we court error and talk nonsense.4 The extension of terms to new situations involve the ex- perimental determination of the existence of corresponding laws. Vagueness of meaning is removed when measure-numbers can be introduced with a complete specification what operations are in- volved with each number assigned. Qualities that do not permit of precise measurement can not play a leading role in physical inquiry, while qualities that do are replaced by the methods of their numeri- cal determination. That qualities which can not be easily and directly distinguished are associated with qualities which are more easily manipulated and capable of sensitive discrimination, is an important fact about nature: it makes science as a project for obtaining knowl- edge and control possible. But this fact should not be converted into a denial of qualitative differences, or used to impoverish the quali- tative wealth of nature by reducing it to three or four measurable characters. However, it is sufficient for the purposes of scientific inquiry to identify terms with the methods of determining them. With Bridgman we may say that "the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations."" When a quality is operationally defined, not all of the conditions of the experiment are stated explicitly, and no a priori reason can be given for excluding the particular time, locality, or experimenter from the list of controlling factors. That not the entire state of the universe need be taken into account in performing experiments, that several experiments may be judged to be the "same" in spite of certain other differences, that there are relative constancies in terms of which changes may be predicated, is a condition for all discourse. So also, it may be urged, the "weight" we determine with a beam balance is not the same (since by definition the operations involved are different) as the "weight" determined with a spring balance. Nor is the "charge" of an electron the same when determined by 3 Cf. Eddington, Mathematical Theory of Belativity, pp. 3-4. 4 Physics, Chap. 2. 5 Logic of Modern Physics, p. 5.</page><page sequence="5">NATURE AND CONVENTION 173 means of the study of Brownian movements as when it is determined with the "balanced drop" method: and yet we believe we are meas- uring the same thing. It is not difficult to raise such objections, but only by neglecting to note (1) that operations selected must be cap- able of indefinite repetition and that hence it is a series of operations which is the defimiens, (2) that objects which enter into the set of operations have a qualitative nature not exhausted by the rela- tional structure of which they become parts, (3) that the funda- mental magnitudes, in terms of which all other measurables are de- termined, are characterized not only by certain transitive assymetric relations, but must be capable of submitting to a definite operation of "addition," and (4) that it is the qualitative homogeneity in the latter which is the basis for identifying magnitudes not identically defined." It is certainly the ideal of science to make the explicit formula- tion of its results in the form of theories exclude any reference to human associations. The nature of particular inquirers, the motives wlhich led them to make discoveries, are completely irrelevant. Yet the desire so to state the outcome of inquiry that would make that outcome independent of its processes and rules, is vain. Were the fabled Martian, innocent of earthly ways, to be confronted with the formulated doctrines of earth-bound men, his understanding and recognition of the validity of science would be miraculous unless the specific physical operations which constitute the meaning of the terms of discourse would also be revealed. A view of nature which defines that to be real which is constant and invariable for all ob- servers,7 is as legitimate as any, but apart from reference to specific qualitative differences, to specific human ways of behavior, the struc- ture of science is a ghostly thing, an empty play of symbols. That definitions in the form of a series of physical operations can be made, betrays something about nature as well as about ourselves. It discloses individualized, denumerable processes, capable of indefi- nite repetition, capable of quantitative analysis. It discloses that we are capable of turning away from the poignancy of the qualitative immediacy of nature, and that by interacting with those processes we can discover linkages in the interest of perpetuating these quali- ties. That these linkages are in a sense subterranean and not obviously connected with the surface play of qualities, and that, as a consequence, science is not a photographic reduplication of nature, has raised the objection that it is to the intervention of human agency the outstanding uniformities of nature are attributable, that our knowledge of nature is "conventional." We turn to an examination of what conventions are.

The most obvious and primitive of such meanings is the act of com- ing together for purposes of deliberation, instruction, amusement, or recreation. The nature of such meetings is as diverse as the reasons for their existence. In every case, however, conventions in this sense are responses to particular human needs. What the consequences of conventions are, are functions not only of those needs, but of the exigencies of the subject-matter through which they are satisfied. They may result in the coordination of activities, the destruction of barriers to communication, or the realization of hitherto unemployed potencies. It is not customary to designate conventions as arbitrary. But if they are to be so considered, arbitrariness devolves upon them either because of the particular field within which their concern lies (and then arbitrariness is identical with the diversity of existential traits), or because of the particular course of action in which they issue. Now action entered upon with an eye toward removing a prior need is the result of deliberation, and whether the act selected ful fills the need which prompted its choice is not the result of a fiat. The role of deliberate choice is the r6le of any hypothesis, and in so far as conventions exist to solve particular difficulties, their arbitrari- ness is that implied in the existence of thought. Conventions as general agreement, contract, customary rule, are an outstanding feature of every civilization. Indeed, they have been identified as the agents of a liberating morality.8 It is difficult to draw clear lines of demarcation between activities purely physiologi- cal and those of conventional origin. And yet the very existence of such customs or habits becomes inexplicable if divorced from the com- pulsion which the nature of the things exercises upon the agreements of men. The well-known example of the traffic rule is much to the point. The rule, it is said, is arbitrary, since there is nothing in the nature of things apart from human purposes to prevent vehicles from using the left side of the road. It is relevant to point out that the very form of the objection implies a sharp separation of human activity from the rest of nature and that consequently any instance of volition is a deus ex machina involving the usual mystery attending a super- natural event. Now rules arise out of specific discontinuities in human affairs, and serve as compromises or devices to bridge such gaps. Subject-matter must be recognized if rules are to be effective. It may be retorted that, granting all this, it is still arbitrary that we designate the right side of the road rather than the left in our 8Dupr6el, "Convention et Raison," Rev. de Met. et Morale, 1925.</page><page sequence="7">NATURE AND CONVENTION 175 prescription; there is nothing in roads, or automobiles, or desires to avoid congestions and accidents, which point uniquely to one side rather than the other; they point to alternatives, but do not dictate the choice between them. To this the following answer seems con- clusive: Whether alternative solutions are possible depends upon how closely we define the set problem. Thus the equation x3 + X2 + X +- 1 = 0, for example, has three roots if we admit nega- tive and imaginary solutions, one if our domain is that of real num- bers and no roots if we restrict ourselves to positive integers. A problem loosely defined may present alternatives in terms of which we may redefine the initial situation to eliminate one or more of the suggested alternatives. Alternatives which do not modify the significance of the problem to which they are solutions, are only verbally different as far as that problem is concerned. Conse- quently, the alleged arbitrariness in the existence of rules which in- volve a choice between alternatives, is the arbitrariness involved in having specific ends-in-view. Now that there are such specific ends- in-view is a fact about nature, and althougrh the fact is local, the metaphysical status of ends-in-view is the same as the status of any specific characters whatsoever. One may always raise the question why (not how) a certain quality is present rather than another; but since no matter what the quality would be, the question may be put, it has the form, but not the significance, of a query. It is a safe rule that an inquiry which does not set the standards for its answers is sheer verbalism. (b) These observations are too commonplace, although too often neglected, to require further elaboration. They have been introduced to point out traits present in all inquiry, and to ask recognition for the obvious fact that the universe can be approached only piecemeal, that subject-matter must be at least tentatively delimited before it can be studied, and that resolutions to pursue some one rather than another mode of inquiry must be made. This, indeed, is the one way in which "conventional" elements appear in science. Much confusion has resulted from Poineare's analysis of the role of hypotheses, in particular of the so-called "un- verifiable" hypotheses in scientific method. His characterization of the choice of geometry as conventional has persuaded many that pronouncements in physics are either tautologous or capricious. Now Poineare 's point was that, essentially, a geometry is a hypothesis as to our measuring appliances, a resolution to operate upon our subject-matter in a certain manner. To ask whether -a geometry is true or false of nature has no meaning, unless the entities and opera- tions of "pure " geometry (i.e., certain symbols) are identified how- ever arbitrarily with a series of empirical objects; lengths, angles,</page><page sequence="8">176 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY congruence, etc., must be defined in terms of very carefully pre- scribed physical operations. If our geometry (really physics) now involves us in contradictions, that is if we discover that the theorems are not verified experimentally when we substitute natural objects for the symbolic scheme, and if we resolve to hold on to our original empirically defined elements, it is always possible to introduce sub- sidiary hypotheses, e.g., forces deforming our apparatus, and so save the consistency of our procedure. But the consistency has been won at the price of recognizing new factors, in our case deforming forces. Whether we separate "geometry" (the study of the rela- tions bodies bear to one another when certain forces are not opera- tive) and "physics" is a matter for the classification of our knowl- edge. We may, of course, redefine our geometrical elements to avoid the need for subsequent modification or complexity in our physics. This is just the procedure adopted in the general relativity theory. Instead of recognizing fields of force which introduce modifications into our measuring devices and appear therefore as something ex- traneous to the geometry originally proposed, the fields of force are initially introduced into the geometry by so defining its elements that throughout the domain of its relevance fields of force shall vanish.9 It is therefore something less than the whole story to maintain that conditions of symmetry "may be entirely created by conventions as to measurement." 10 The formulation of symmetry is conventional, but, like simplicity, if not a "property of the real world" can be won only at the expense of subsequent complexity, or by a disregard of factors which ultimately compel our attention. (c) Conventions are Janus-faced. For in addition to the unique nature that they possess as particular operations, they are conven- tions for a certain field of inquiry, that is, they look toward subject- matter; and at the same time they are directed to a group of in- quirers, defining the point of approach in terms of which the objects of inquiry can be initially fixed. Because conventions are for a cer- tain subject-matter, structure independent of human volition is im- plied. Because conventions refer to beings endowed with purpose, they are a way of considering subject-matter, a set of operations, a selection from the rich bosom of nature. Conventions for something are conventions for someone. Conventions, like concepts, are not mere psychological affairs, impositions of order on an amorphous flux, whose significance is ex- hausted by their human reference. It is true that science is, in an obvious sense, a mental product, and that the objects of our knowl- 9 For a detailed account, c.f.

In spite of the popularity of Baconian theories of science, students of scientic method recognize that no investigation starts with complete ignorance, but with funded knowledge in terms of which the investigation is defined and carried on. What is at our disposal at the beginning of inquiry, is a func- tioni both of the subject-matter and of the skill and imagination of the investigator. What elements may serve as data for the resolu- tion of the set problem requires insight and experience to discover. But that the data are sufficient for the task is not a matter of choice or agreement, it is determined by the subject-matter as inference and experiment disclose. As against Vaihinger and his school, who find in the alleged self-contradictory nature of "fictions" a proof of their impotence to come to grips with reality in spite of their useful- ness, it may be pointed out that "usefulness" as an explanatory category has been demonstrated to have metaphysical bearings as loncr ago as Plato of the Cratylus. The data of science are defined by certain operations, are modified on further inquiry, and indeed may well be said to be manufactured and would lose their meaning if separated from the inquiry for which they are designed. But the data are given certain functions because the subject-matter can be ianipulated to yield them. It is a common practice to generalize a relation experimentally determined in a certain domain by defining a similar type of uni- formity witlhin a more comprehensive region so that when conditions of verifiability obtain, the relation will hold. This can be seen in the history of the doctrine of energy." The definition then functions as a hypothesis with which we survey and correlate events having a more extensive scope than we are capable of confirming experi- mentally. Such hypotheses take the form of guiding principles which may prove fertile or not in suggesting verifiable relations, but which can not be overthrown by any crucial experiment. The prin- ciple involved in the creation of such hypotheses is the same as that involved in the choice of a geometry. This shows clearly the shallow- niess of a philosophy of scientific method that gives central import- ance to crucial experiments. The distinction between fact and hypothesis is a shifting one, shifting with the context in which it operates, and with the stage of inquiry reached. The determination of certain data for points of departure does not imply the determination of all discoverable connections. We may virtually select some rather than others by selecting one point of departure instead of another. But the connections we do so virtually select, only the subject-matter can decide. The presence of conventional elements does not therefore vitiate 11 Cf. Planck, Prinzip der Erhaltung der Energie, 5. ed., pp. 90, 111.</page><page sequence="10">178 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the procedure of science, at least not on any theory which recognizes that one may have valid knowledge without knowing everything. Knowledge may be called absolute in the sense that definite answers are discoverable to definite problems. But knowledge that is abso- lute in the sense of having no bearing on specific issues, although it may be the despair of a romantic pessimism, is no provocative to lamentation for those who understand what we do when we know. III Much has been made of the relational nature of scientific subject- matter. Science is not history, it does not accumulate facts to distil their unique flavor, it concerns itself not with particulars in their concreteness. Its professed and performed task is to show linkages, discover unsuspected correlations between things diversely quali- fied; its concern is to exhibit the form events possess as functions of other events. Consequently, it is never content to leave fields of in- quiry disconnected, but aims to find general methods in order to unify them. Although subject-matter is delimited when studied, the ultimate goal is to push back the limits indefinitely by coordinating diverse fields. In physics this synthesizing process finds many illustrations. Not only is its theoretical structure transformed from time to time by the "reduction" of an independent domain to a branch of an- other, e.g., electromagnetism to a branch of mechanics, but within some one field of inquiry a fertile generalization is introduced through the elimination of special conditions of observation and special points of approach, from the form of the discovered uni- formities. In the study of dynamical systems, for example, we ask that the equations of motion be true not only when referred, say, to the sun, but that irrespective of our orientation, our velocity, or even acceleration relative to the objects considered, the laws which express their behavior preserve a certain form. This demand has been formulated as the principle that the equations of dynamics shall be covariant under every continuous transformation of the co6rdinates. The most powerful mathematical instrument invented so far to eliminate the particularity of approach is the tensor calculus. It has been repeatedly hailed as the means by which we may escape from a provincial physics to a knowledge of the truly universal laws of nature. In its mathematical aspect it is the study of certain differ- ential invariants: by its help any set of coordinates may be trans- lated into any other set so that certain functions of the coordinates shall remain unchanged under the transformation. The calculus is therefore a kind of universal language, attempting to eliminate what</page><page sequence="11">NATURE AND CONVENTION 179 is parochial in any one selection of measure-numbers, and to con- centrate upon what is common to all. In assigning measure-numbers in physics we make use of operations which do not enter explicitly into the equations of theory. It is advantageous to avoid connec- tions between co6rdinates which issue solely from the way they are manufactured. The importance of tensors is that they attune us to a universality which escapes us so long as the accent of one set of measure-numbers is permitted, so to speak, to drown out the gram- mar common to all. "That which is common to all, and which is equally in a part and in the whole, does not constitute the essence of any particular thing." 12 It is a curious turn of events, which one might suppose could occur only in a realm of fancy, did not the history of thought and contemporary discussion give other evidence, that on attaining a comprehensive outlook men are led to deny the validity of a more restricted generalization. It is by a strange irony that a method which attempts to remove a dogmatic priority for any one approach should persuade some that no one approach has validity because all are equally valid. It is a surprising reading of the outcome of science, but not an unusual one, that concludes by converting laws of physics whose derivation and meaning imply the existence of less comprehensive formulations, into hypostatic entities with a superior claim to reality than the latter. The discovery that bodies have be- havior patterns should not be perverted by making those patterns the conditions for the existence of bodies, or by imagining those patterns to stand over against the bodies whose behavior gives to those pat- terns meaning; to do so is to invest the outcome of an inquiry for causal factors with an importance it does not possess outside of that inquiry. For the truth is, bodies are found in relational contexts, and relational contexts are relations between bodies. That there always is a reference to the individualized behavior of bodies even in an invariant formulation of physics, is evident if we examine carefully, for example, the derivation of the equations of motion for a given "free particle" from the tensor form of the law of gravitation. Comparison of the terms of that law with co- ordinates having an ascertained empirical foundation is constantly made.'3 For without such matching of the terms of the general theory with experimentally well-founded concepts, no light is thrown upon what we are to expect in actual cases. If the equations of motion retain their form in all co6rdinate systems, it is at the ex- pense of disregarding a host of observable features in actual mo- tions, and while formally the equations retain a certain simplicity, 12 Spinoza, Ethics, Part 11, Prop. 37. is Eddington, Mathematical Theory of Relativity, ?? 38, 47.</page><page sequence="12">180 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY when their significance is sought in special cases a parochial view has to be reintroduced.14 The symbolic expression of the law requires no restricted point of view, although restricted points of view are indispensable to the law. It can lead only to confusion, therefore, to maintain that the external world is a synthesis of appearances from all points of view. For if the external world is this synthesis, then any one of the elements of the synthesis, any one of the par- ticular space-time frames of reference, is not that world. And if this synthesis acquires significance only by virtue of interpreta- tions from particular points of view, then a quest for that synthesis is a quest for a hypostatic external world which forever eludes us. Because the "colorless" patterns of science are after all patterns of a "colored" content, there have not been lacking resigned but melancholy sighs that science can tell us nothing of the "true nature" of things since that content is not itself a pattern. But the heroic remedy of dissolving things into relations, of displacing "sub- stance" by "function," repeatedly proposed to give comfort against such reflections, is not certain to produce relief if we remember that invariants without a field of variables are nonsense, and that to substitute for the fulness of events a selected aspect of them is con- fusion. Eddington has a tale of the discovery of a volume contain- ing the rules of chess, supposedly forgotten and no longer culti- vated, but giving no indication of the shape or size of pieces, or the color of the board. "It is obvious," he remarks, "that no amount of study of the volume will reveal the true nature either of the par- ticipants in the game-the chessmen, or the field of the game-the chessboard' '.15 Analogically, we are told that by no study of experi- ments can the absolute nature of the participants-the electrons, point-events-be revealed. What does the assumption that things have true natures not disclosed by experiment mean? It may mean that they are unknowable, or that they are not yet known, or that they are not matters for knowledge at all. If the first is meant, it is difficult to see why anyone should concern himself with unknowable true natures, or even know that there are any such; if the second, there is no reason for despair. If, thirdly,' it is meant that true natures are unique qualities, non-communicable, to be directly pos- sessed, it is well to remember that it is not the function of knowledge to reduplicate its subject-matter nor to devour it, that one can be in love without knowing what it means to be so, or (perhaps) acquire a knowledge of its significance (e.g., by reading Plato) without ever being wounded by the arrows of the god. An untenable separation of theory from its application has led 14 Cf. Silberstein, Theory of Relativity, 2. ed., pp. 366-370. 15 Space, Time, and Gravitation, p. 184.</page><page sequence="13">NATURE AND CONVENTION 181 many physicists to formulate what might be called a "phenomenalism of the instrument," and to maintain that physics knows nothing of the world but pointer-readings. "The physicist's knowledge bears upon the nature of matter, but it is a knowledge of pointer-readings only." Although this manner of viewing the subject-matter of science is associated with some of the greatest names, it seems never- theless to be based upon a misunderstanding or a gross neglect of the theory of physical measurement. Scale readings are calibrations which involve, and are taken as signs of, properties of matter estab- lished independently of many theories subsequently elaborated. Pointer-readings function like any signs; they are discriminated only after much labor, and used for safeguarding inference. To take them as primitive, and thereby generate problems concerning the reality of the flux of qualities, is on the level of a philosophy which takes cases of perception as cases of knowledge and then finds the existence of knowledge and error a problem. The introduction of the term "reality" into physics produces nothing but confusion. Eddington writes: "He who doubts the reality of the four-dimensional world can only be compared to a man who doubts the reality of the penny, and prefers to regard one of its innumerable appearances as the real object." 16 But the point at issue is never a matter of reality, it is one of discovering what prob- lems are involved and what conditions are necessary to solve them satisfactorily. Advances in science do not consist in progressively unveiling reality in the sense that layers of appearance are dis- covered; they consist in making our knowledge more inclusive, more unified. The success of a new theory does not relegate the old to a realm of appearance, nor does it by an act of miracle transform the truth of the old into a falsehood. A physical theory is always hypothetically entertained to explain and coordinate information already obtained, to guide further exploration. In so far as a theory is thus successfully exploited, its truth is never impugned within the field which was its original province. A new theory may be more comprehensive, assert connections of which the one discarded did not take cognizance. But on pain of committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent, within the domain that both theories are successful neither can be supposed to disclose reality to the ex- clusion of the reality disclosed by the other. The world contains more than science affirms it to contain. Poetry, music, love, and friendship, teach us much never to be dis- covered in the laboratory or the study of the mathematician. But if we ask what minimum features of the world science can reveal, the answer that must be given is that nature is a realm of continuity or 16 Loc. cit., p. 182.</page><page sequence="14">182 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY necessity, and a realm of individualized events. The world is much more than this, and any survey of it which reports these features to be all there is, is arrogant in its claims. But because science does itot exhaust the wealth which is nature, and pays for the enlighten- ment it brings by illuminating only a segment of that wealth, does not make it partially false.
