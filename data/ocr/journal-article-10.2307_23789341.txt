<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sound and Shapes of Noise: Measuring Disturbances in Early Twentieth-Century Telephone and Radio Engineering Chen-Pang Yeang In this paper; I examine efforts of telephone and radio engineers and researchers from 1910 to 1940 to measure noise as unwanted signals. Two approaches were adopted, one aural, the other visual. The staff of American Telephone and Telegraph Company employed an ear-balancing method, in which a measurer determined the intensity of noise by comparing it with a standard referential tone. This method relied on assumptions about the human measurers aural perception. It had a close relationship with the research at Bell Laboratories on speech recogni tion and hearing physiology. Also, it was used to measure the electrical noise in telephone transmission lines and atmospheric electromagnetic static that interfered with radio communications for the purpose of gauging and improving the per formance of the telecommunication systems. On the other hand, physicists at the U.K. Radio Research Board applied the oscilloscope to record the waveforms of atmospheric static. Built upon work on cathode-ray displays, this method inherited a long visual tradition of curve tracing. The choice of this method was associated with their aim of measurement: to reveal the detailed processes of meteorological events that incurred electric discharge and, more importantly, to determine the exact locations of such events. These attempts to measure noise indicated a trend of conceiving concrete acoustic noise in terms of abstract, informational noise. In 1948, Claude Shannon, a young researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories, proposed a mathematical characterisation of communication.

As the medium to deliver signals, the channel is often contaminated with noise. Noise, in Shannon's view, 'is considered to be a chance variable', and 'may be represented by a suitable stochastic process.'1 Subsequently, this abstract, generic and statistical notion of noise has been highly influential in a number of fields. Today, the term refers to any apparently random change of quantities from stock prices and seismographic records to chemical concentrations in a cell and populations in a country. In other words, noise is an informational attribute. Yet, the identification of noise with irregular fluctuations was not gener ally taken for granted before the second half of the twentieth century. For hundreds of years, the term noise had always referred to a specific type of sound. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, noise is primarily 'senses relating to sound or the disturbance caused by this.'2 Throughout his tory, noise was thought of in terms of a din, a roar, cacophony, disharmony - a sensory attribute connected to hearing and listening. How the notion of noise extended from unpleasant sound to abstract dis turbances of information is a much bigger question than etymology. Its answer would take us on a long journey, traversing the electromechanical reproduction of sounds, Einstein's and Smoluchowski's works on Brownian motions, the mathematical theories of stochastic processes, the birth of elec tronics and the beginning of cybernetics and information theory. My aim is to examine a small but important episode of this journey: the attempts in the early twentieth century to treat some channel fluctuations in radio and tele phone systems as quantitative physical effects by measuring them with elaborate scientific instruments. Emily Thompson and Jonathan Sterne have argued that the introduction of electro-acoustic technologies during this period contributed to change the 'soundscape' of the modern world, as those technologies helped create conditions that shaped the habits of hearing, aesthetics of music, quests of fidelity and sensibilities to new environmental sound.3 To this we can add that such technologies also helped cultivate the quantifiable and mathematical notions of noise. As the two most prominent electro-acoustic technologies, radio and telephone were also the immediate material prototypes of Shannon's information theory. The 'noise' in radio and telephone channels represented both annoying sound and irregular disturb ances to signals, and thus cut across the sonic and informational aspects of the term.4 Among various radio and telephone channel disturbances, we will focus on those that engineers and scientists believed to be the results of electro magnetic radiation from the atmosphere - known as 'atmospheric noise' or 'atmospherics' - and fluctuating motions of electrons in electric circuits - known as electronic noise. There is a reason for this choice: although</page><page sequence="3">Chen-Pang Yeang 65 engineers had tackled telephonic cross-talk, effects of power lines, street cars and electric appliances, as well as interferences between wireless links, atmospheric noise and electronic noise were arguably the first two kinds of channel disturbances that attracted researchers' attention because of both their practical and their scientific implications. Unlike those man-made interferences, which were mere plights that degraded technological systems' performance, atmospherics and electronic noise represented physical effects that could be interesting for their own sake. Consequently, researchers devoted more efforts to exploring them; they believed that reducing the harm of such noise involved not only the design of noise-insensitive systems, but also more understanding of the noise's characteristics. A primary aspect of exploring atmospherics and electronic noise was to measure them. In this paper, we study two major methods - one aural and one visual - which engineers and scientists used in the 1920s to measure these types of noise: the ear-balancing method and the oscilloscopic display. Although both methods aimed to quantify noise, they differed greatly con cerning what features of noise should be quantified. The ear-balancing scheme measured the average intensity of noise at distinct frequencies; by contrast, the oscilloscope displayed noise's waveforms and accordingly offered temporal information about the fluctuations. Moreover, the roles of the human measurer and, consequently, the meanings of conducting measurement in these two methods were different. The visual method boasted 'objectivity' and independence from observers, but the aural method implicitly relied on certain assumptions concerning human perception. These differences reflected engineers' and scientists' different purposes for char acterising noise; the aural method was designed to gauge the effects of noise on the performance of wired and wireless telegraphy and telephony, whereas the visual method aimed to identify the electric discharging processes and locations of meteorological events that generated atmospherics. The story of the attempts to obtain the sound and shapes of noise thus confirm historians' findings that quantification was not a homogeneous process, but rather a collection of ambivalent pursuits with multiple meanings, values and assumptions.5 THE AURAL APPROACH Measure Atmospherics Atmospheric noise has haunted radio technology since its beginning. As early as the 1890s, pioneers of wireless communications, such as Alexander Popov in Russia and Albert Turpain in France, had noted that thunderstorms usually accompanied hissing or cracking sound at the receiver, which</page><page sequence="4">66 The Sound and Shapes of Noise interfered or even interrupted the reception of telegraphic signals.6 But thunderstorms were not the exclusive factor for this background noise; it could appear, albeit with weaker intensity, without obvious weather disturbances. In 1902, the British radio experimenter Captain Henry Jackson found that the background noise was more severe during the daytime than during the night time; it was also more serious in the summer than in the winter.7 Thus, the noise seemed to have a close geophysical connection. By the first decade of the twentieth century, radio engineers, operators and amateurs widely believed that fluctuations of this kind were due to erratic electromagnetic radiation from the atmosphere, and they had developed a few rules of thumb about the effects of such atmospheric noise (also known as 'static' or 'stray wave'): winter was the best season, night was quieter, regions at higher lati tudes suffered less noise and the intensity of static decreased with radio frequency. In the U.S., the first systematic observations of the atmospherics took place during World War I. When the country entered the war in 1917, the trans-Atlantic wireless between the American Navy's high-power radio sta tion in Arlington, Virginia, and the French Army's counterpart on top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris became a critical communication link for both militaries. Atmospherics were a persistent problem of this trans-Atlantic connexion. To find solutions to the problem, the Naval Radio-Telegraphic Laboratory, led by physicist Louis Austin, conducted a long-term project to monitor atmospherics from August 1917 to May 1918 at the National Bureau of Standards' building in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Navy's observation campaign was designed foremost to explore atmospherics' qualitative features. Austin recognised that atmospherics incurred four kinds of sonic effects at a receiver earphone: (i) rattling or grinding noise (which was the most common sonic effect), (ii) hissing tone, (iii) sharp snap and (iv) noise somewhat like the first, but accompanied by more crashing. These types of noise, he pointed out, were associated with dif ferent meteorological occurrences: (i) snow or rain, (ii) lightning flashes and (iii) thunderstorms.8 Here he treated atmospherics as noise in its literal sense. Austin did, however, undertake quantitative measurement of atmospheric noise. He was interested in measuring the intensity of atmospherics at a receiver under different radio frequencies. This seemed to be a straight forward task: the intensity of atmospherics was the strength of the atmos phere's electromagnetic radiation at the receiver; thus a good antenna and a proper electromagnetic detector would be able to measure it. But the task was not that simple, for static noise was usually too fluctuating, transient and fast changing to measure directly with a detector. Austin's solution was to employ an indirect measuring procedure, using a so-called 'audibility metre'. The</page><page sequence="5">Chen-Pang Yeang 6^7 audibility meter was an electrolytic detector connected in parallel to a circuit comprising an earphone, a battery and a variable resistor. When a radio wave entered the receiver, the detector responded to the electromagnetic radiation with change of resistance, which, in turn, changed the electric current flow ing through the earphone and hence created a sound on the earphone. To measure the intensity of the radiation, the radio operator adjusted the vari able resistor until the sound was 'barely audible' and read the resistor's value. In Austin's procedure, the 'bare audibility' of atmospherics was defined as the condition 'at which an average of three pulses of disturbances could be heard in telephone in ten seconds.'9 Following this procedure, Austin performed atmospherics intensity measurement at radio frequencies between 16.6 and 100 kHz. His results confirmed radio operators' folk wisdom that atmos pherics intensity decreased with frequency. Austin's audibility meter marked the first attempt to turn atmospheric noise into a measurable quantity. This meter appealed to engineers' prefer ence to quantification, but it had several problems. Austin's method offered a relative instead of absolute measure, as the reading was in the unit of resist ance, not in the electromagnetic field strength. In addition, the proportion ality between the reading at the variable resistor and the electromagnetic field intensity at the receiver was contingent upon the quantitative behaviour of the electrolytic detector, which had not been totally determined at the time. Moreover, the condition of 'three pulses in ten seconds' was arbitrary; it implicitly conflated the category of signal amplitude with the signal rate of repetition. Understandably, Austin's method did not dominate the metrol ogy of atmospheric noise. Enter the Ear-Balancing Method The more popular approach to measuring atmospherics in the 1920s came from American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), as a product of the com pany's expansion of wireless telephonic services. Like the U.S. Navy's audibility meter, AT&amp;T's ear-balancing method also included human audit ory skills as part of the measuring instrumentation. Both methods sought to gauge noise intensity. But, in contrast to the audibility meter's reliance on the mediation of the detector's changing resistance, the ear-balancing scheme resorted more directly to the observer's aural perception: s/he balanced the sound of atmospheric noise and that of a local signal until the two seemed to have the same strength and then took the local signal intensity as the noise intensity. The ear-balancing method originated during the heyday of (wire) tele phone in the 1900s and 1910s. As the envelope of telephone coverage was pushing to engulf all of North America, engineers confronted an increasing</page><page sequence="6">68 The Sound and Shapes of Noise challenge to long-distance signal transmission. To ensure the quality of com munication, they needed a scheme to gauge the performance of telephone links. The earliest way to do this was to get the relative gauge by comparing two links at the same time: testers just talked over two circuits alternatively and subjectively judged which one was better. Engineers used this means to compare copper with iron wire, open lines with cables, etc. But as telephone engineering became more sophisticated, a more rigorous approach was necessary. By the early twentieth century, AT&amp;T replaced the simple com parison between two circuits by a comparison between a targeted circuit and a 'reference' circuit. The reference circuit comprised a telephone station and an artificial line simulating the ordinary cable. This artificial line had both a standard-attenuation-per-unit length and a variable length. Thus, testers could adjust the length of the reference circuit until its voice appeared the same as the targeted circuit's voice. That length, or the equivalent overall attenuation, then represented a gauge of the targeted circuit's signal intensity. But, as the arbitrariness of the reference circuits became more obvious, the measuring method evolved again. In the 1910s, AT&amp;T engineers introduced an adjustable local oscillator at the measuring instrument to replace the refer ence circuit and compared the voice from the tested telephone circuit with the sound from this local signal generator.10 AT&amp;T quickly extended the use of this ear-balancing scheme from wire telephone to radio as the company introduced its trans-Atlantic wireless tele phonic systems. In 1921, AT&amp;T planned to launch a full-time commercial telephone service between America and Britain. The transmitters and receivers for this system were designated at a radio station of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in Rocky Point, Long Island, and at a branch office of AT&amp;T's manufacturing wing, Western Electric, in Southgate near London. The transmitting power was 100 kW, and the oper ating frequency was 57 kHz. On 15 January 1923, 60 people from AT&amp;T, RCA, Western Electric and the British Post Office gathered in a testing room in London to listen to voices sent from AT&amp;T headquarters in New York. The success of this test started a four-month measuring program.11 A central purpose of the measuring program was to acquire systematic, long-term data on trans-Atlantic radio-wave propagation and atmospherics, particularly their diurnal and seasonal variations. Western Electric engineer H.D. Arnold and AT&amp;T engineer Lloyd Espenschied were responsible for the program.12 Key to the program was the development of effective methods to measure radio signals and noise. Here the AT&amp;T engineers encountered the same problem as Louis Austin did, especially with atmospherics: the noise was too irregular, transient and fast changing for its electromagnetic field to register on an off-the-shelf detector. To deal with this problem, AT&amp;T's Ralph Bown and Western Electrics' C.R. Englund and H.T. Friis</page><page sequence="7">Chen-Pang Yeang 6 9 Local ¡ &amp; Signal S Producer ! ï Shield-'" Loop Filter Amplifier Detector Amplifier 23,000~ Supply Oscillator Local i &amp; Signal 3 Producer ! i Loop Shield-'" Filter Amplifier Detector Amplifier 23,000~ Supply Oscillator Figure 1. The block diagram of Bown's et al. comparative method for radio-signal measurement. From R.Bown, C.R. Englund, and H.T. Friis, 'Radio transmission measurements', Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, 11:2 (1923): 119-153, Figure 2. developed a measuring instrument in 1923 at Western Electric's receiver laboratory in Cliffwood, New Jersey. Their set was based on the idea of ear balancing that had prevailed in the company's cable telephone engineering: a receiver with an earphone was connected via a switch to both an ordinary antenna and a local signal generator. When the switch connected the receiver to the antenna, the operator heard the radio signal or atmospherics. When the switch connected the receiver to the local-signal generator, the operator heard the local signal. The local signal's intensity was adjustable and easily determined. In a measurement, therefore, the operator switched between the antenna and the local signal generator and adjusted the local-signal intensity until the local signal's sound volume at the output earphone appeared identical to the radio signal's or atmospherics' sound volume. The local sig nal's intensity was taken to be equal to the radio signal's or noise's intensity (Figure 1). The core of this method was the local-signal generator with which the incoming radio input compared. What signals were comparable to the test ing radio signals and atmospheric noise? For the testing radio signals, the answer was easy: since the actual signals were telegraphic dots and dashes with a monotonie carrier frequency, choosing the local signals as monotonie waves would make the intensity comparison straightforward. And the signal intensity obtained from such a comparison, the AT&amp;T engineers believed, would represent a good measure of the radio signal's real, physical strength (i.e., the strength of its electric field).13 Measuring atmospheric noise was trickier, for it could not be properly emulated by the single-tone local signals. Yet, maybe it was not that relevant</page><page sequence="8">70 The Sound and Shapes of Noise to measure the physical strength of noise, Bown et al. argued. Rather, they 'approached noise from the telephone standpoint'. In other words, they were more concerned with the disturbing effect of noise on telephone users' hear ing of normal speech and voices than with the absolute intensity of noise. Consequently, they asserted, 'a good way of measuring noise should be to express it in terms of a volume of speech upon which it produces a certain standard interfering effect.' Defining standard speech for such measurements was no less difficult, but the engineers found a pragmatic way to circumvent the challenge. Instead of trying to determine standard speech, they set the local signal for noise measurement to be 'artificial speech', which had a single audio frequency tone that was changing uniformly between 600 and 1400 cycles at a rate of ten times per second. They justified this arrangement by noting that the audio tones in ordinary human voices approximately fol lowed that change on average. When measuring atmospherics, an operator adjusted the volume of the local artificial speech until his or her ear was 'just about to recognise its presence'. That threshold volume was then taken as the effective strength of atmospheric noise. The measurements done in this man ner were inevitably 'subjective' and might suffer inaccuracy, as Bown et al. recognised, but they contended that the data obtained from different unskilled observers using this method had a variation of less than 50%, which was small compared to the actual variation of atmospherics. Thus, the method was stable enough to generate precise results.14 Bown's et al. ear-balancing method served Arnold and Espenschied's measuring program well in 1923. It is beyond the scope of this paper to dis cuss the results from this program. Suffice to point out that the data exhib ited important patterns of atmospherics' diurnal and seasonal variations, which helped improve the noise resisting performance of AT&amp;T's trans Atlantic wireless telephony. Also, Arnold and Espenschied presented the data in terms of not only signal and noise, but also in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, which marked the first time - as far as I know - that this term appeared in engineering literature.15 This ear-balancing method dominated AT&amp;T's radio atmospherics measurements throughout the 1920s. During the remainder of 1923, Arnold collaborated with two of his colleagues, C.N. Anderson and Austin Bailey, in an effort to extend the trans-Atlantic measuring program. Their new observations revealed the variation of atmospherics with radio frequency between 15 and 60 kHz, confirming Austin's earlier conclusion that atmos pheric noise diminished with frequency, while reaching that conclusion with more accurate and abundant data. After the company switched focus to long distance wireless telephony at shorter wavelengths (frequencies above 1 MHz), engineers employed the same method to measure atmospherics at higher frequencies. Between 1930 and 1931, Ralph Potter employed the</page><page sequence="9">Chen-Pang Yeang 71 ear-balancing instrument to monitor the variation of atmospherics between 5 and 18.4 MHz.16 The ear-balancing method was used to gauge not only radio atmospherics, but also other kinds of noise. In the early 1920s, AT&amp;T engineers cooper ated with members of the League for the Hard of Hearing to develop a vacuum-tube audiometer that measured the hearing capacity (the minimum audible volume) of individual subjects at different frequencies. In 1926, a science editor of Forum magazine took a Western Electric audiometer to measure the level of urban acoustic noise in various parts of New York City, based precisely on the principle of ear balancing (i.e., adjusting the intensity of the local oscillator until the local signal appeared to have the same volume as that of the ambient noise). Three years later, the Noise Abatement Commission of New York embarked on a more systematic investigation by dispatching a mobile noise measuring truck, using the same kind of ear balancing audiometer.17 Measure Electronic Noise with the Ear-Balancing Method It is worth noting that the human body played a central part in the ear balancing measurement of noise. The apparently non-anthropomorphic expression of atmospherics in terms of local signal intensity was actually a surrogate for a procedure involving the measurer's judgment and operation. In fact, the instrument did not measure the physical intensity of noise as such, but rather gauged the noise's effect of masking the hearing of sound. In other words, what the ear-balancing method quantified was not atmospheric noise's magnitude of disturbance, but instead the degrees of perception the noise caused in specific communication systems. Thus, the ear-balancing device required the measurer's aural perception and discretion concerning the equal volume between noise and a reference sound, as well as his manual intervention in tuning the reference sound to match the noise. As Graeme Gooday has found, this dependence on human sensitivity and action has a long tradition in the history of metrology that can be traced back to technical practices in electrical science and engineering during Victorian Britain.18 Unlike Gooday's historical actors, the aforementioned protagonists of the ear-balancing method did not mention explicitly the moral virtues, author ship and accountability of measurement. But, in spite of their endeavours in the 1920s to improve the ear-balancing method, the AT&amp;T researchers never attempted to reduce it to a fully automatic indicator from which the measurer could take directly numerical outcomes. Humans were always con sidered as part of the measurement. This human-centred character of the ear-balancing method made sense, for it was designed for use in telephone and telegraph engineering. The</page><page sequence="10">72 The Sound and Shapes of Noise impact of atmospherics or other types of noise on masking hearing (of telecommunicated sound) was exactly what the engineers at AT&amp;T tried to gauge. Therefore, the method's dependence on aural perception did not introduce a distortion, but actually constituted a sine qua non to measure ment. Nonetheless, problems ensued as researchers employed the same method to determine the energy level or strength of electromotive force of noise rather than its physiological effects. As we will see, when German physicists around the same time used the ear-balancing method to measure electronic noise, the ignorance of the method's physiological context in the initial experimental design led to a controversy that nearly terminated the first statistical theory of noise. Engineers and scientists had been familiar with the performance fluctu ations of electrical circuits and systems caused by defective components. But at the turn of the twentieth century, they started to worry about the more 'fundamental' limit of electrical circuits resulting from fluctuations associated not with the imperfection of devices, but with the properties of electrons. The statistical mechanical works on Brownian motions in the 1900s pro vided a conceptual ground for this thinking about electronic noise. Yet, the significant technological progress in vacuum-tube amplifiers in the 1910s, which enabled the amplification of very weak signals and hence rendered them more vulnerable to electronic noise, gave researchers stronger in centives to inspect its practical implications. The German physicist Walter Schottky was one of the first individuals to pay attention to electronic noise. A former student of Planck and Einstein and a director of Siemens's communication electronics laboratory in Berlin during World War I, he had both the intellectual background and pragmatic motivation to study the issue. In 1918, he proposed a theory about the intrin sic electronic noise in a vacuum-tube circuit. Schottky acknowledged the presence of electric-current fluctuations caused by electrons' Brownian-like thermal agitations (an effect Einstein had predicted in the 1900s). But, he thought that, in a vacuum tube, this 'thermal noise' was much smaller than the fluctuations resulting from random shots of discrete electrons, known as 'shot noise'. Schottky then derived a mathematical formula for the average current intensity of shot noise, based on Einstein's statistical-mechanical doctrine and Planck's work on black-body radiation.19 Schottky's shot noise remained a physical effect on paper for two years, as it was difficult to conduct scientific research in chaotic post-war Germany. In 1920, a Siemens researcher, C.A. Hartmann, made the first attempt to empirically corroborate Schottky's theory. At the company's communication electronics laboratory, Hartmann conducted an experiment to measure a vacuum tube's shot noise.20 His basic setup consisted of a vacuum tube</page><page sequence="11">Chen-Pang Yeang 73 connected in parallel to a capacitor and an inductor. The goals of his experi ment were to verify (i) whether this circuit indeed had a noisy tube current, and (ii), if so, whether the noise intensity was consistent with Schottky's prediction. Hartmann proposed a procedure to address the second goal based on the fact that Schottky's quantitative prediction involved the charge of the electron e. He expressed Schottky's formula as a relation of e with other variables. This relation indicated that the ratio involving the measured shot current, the tube's bias current and the circuit's resonance frequency should be a fundamental physical constant e=1.6 X 10~19 coulomb. Though simple in concept, Hartmann's experiment was challenging in several senses. One of these challenges was to make precise measurements of the shot current. Similar to radio atmospherics, shot noise was irregular and difficult to measure with ordinary detectors. Hartmann adopted the ear balancing method similar to that used by AT&amp;T engineers. In his design, the tube oscillator and a reference monotone generator tuned at the oscillator's resonance frequency were connected to a high-gain amplifier with a switch. Hartmann then switched between the tube oscillator and the monotonie sig nal generator and adjusted the latter until the intensity from both sounds appeared the same at the output earphone. The monotonie signal intensity, easily measured by a galvanometer, was taken as the effective intensity of the shot noise.21 Hartmann's experimental results were qualitatively satisfactory yet quan titatively problematic. The apparatus indeed produced hissing tones at the output earphone, suggesting the presence of shot noise. He measured the effective shot-noise intensity for resonance frequencies from 238.73 to 2387.33 Hz, and used the measured results to calculate the charge of the electron e. To his disappointment, however, the results deviated signifi cantly from Schottky's prediction. The value of e from the shot-noise measurements changed with frequency, instead of remaining at a constant, as it should have. Hartmann's data was difficult to explain if Schottky's theory was accurate. In the following years, physicists working on shot noise tried a variety of approaches to figure out the nature of the discrepancy between Schottky's theory and Hartmann's experiment. Some corrected Schottky's mathematics, some blamed his physical assumptions and some attempted to redo the experiment with different setups. For our purpose, we only need to concen trate on a critique of Hartmann's measuring scheme. According to that critique, Hartmann made a serious mistake when using the ear-balancing method, as he ignored its dependence on human perception. In 1922, a Czech physicist, Reinhold Fürth at the University of Prague, explained the variation of Hartmann's e value with frequency in terms of the</page><page sequence="12">74 The Sound and Shapes of Noise 'physiological' nature of the experimental method.22 Fiirth argued that one could not take the results of Hartmann's noise measurement from the ear balancing method at face value, for the method relied on the mediation of the experimenters aural cognition, a frequency-dependent feature. The problem with the German experimenter was that he did not choose the reference local signals according to such aural cognition (unlike the AT&amp;T engineers' 'artificial speech'), but naively set them to be monotonie oscillations. Consequently, the ear-balancing method required the experimenter to iden tify when the noise sound intensity equalled the monotonie sound intensity and to take the monotonie current as the measure of the noise current. Yet the two signals causing the same degree of aural perception in human ears had equal intensity if, and only if, the strength of human aural perception was proportional to the signal intensity (or, the strength of stimulation), and if the signals were at the same frequency. Both Hartmann's assumptions turned out to be incorrect, The Weber Fechner law in psychology proved the first assumption incorrect, and the spectral character of the broad-band shot noise differed significantly from that of the monotonie reference signal. By making a more elaborate use of the Weber-Fechner Law and removing the incorrect assumptions, Fiirth reinterpreted Hartmann's data and produced a new estimate for the value of e with a much slighter variation with frequency - his values deviated from 1.6 X 10~19 coulomb within one-hundred percent. Incorporating the physi ological context saved Schottky's theory. The ear-balancing method in the 1920s epitomised a particular route toward quantifying noise. Although both atmospherics and electronic noise were treated as genuine physical effects, the method nonetheless sought to measure the degrees of human perceptive responses (in this case hearing) to those effects, and not to the effects themselves. The human measurer was thus a crucial part of the measuring instrument, and the whole metrological agenda was not separated from the technological contexts of telephone and radio. In addition, among all possible quantitative measures of noise, the method only focused on its average magnitude. Moreover, although the ear balancing measuring set was by no means the spectral analyser that became popular decades later, engineers did find it a handy instrument to determine the frequency response of noise. This route was by no means unique. Around the time when the American and German engineers and scientists used the ear-balancing method to measure noise, a few British researchers approached the same metrological problems with an alternative means. In contrast to the ear-balancing method's aural characteristics, the latter scheme replied on the visual display of noise waveforms.</page><page sequence="13">Chen-Pang Yeang 75 THE VISUAL APPROACH As Louis Austin's team measured atmospheric noise in the 1910s, a group of British researchers also conducted research on radio disturbances from the atmosphere. However, unlike the members of Austins team, who were pre occupied with the implications of atmospherics to wireless communication, the second group was more concerned with studying atmospherics as meteorological effects and exploring their use in weather forecasting. The head of the British group was an electrical engineer, Robert Watson Watt (later Watson-Watt). In 1915, he joined the Meteorological Office of the British Air Ministry (the predecessor of the Royal Air Force). A military engineering agency, the office aimed to provide weather forecast for the ministry to determine flight schedules. The weather phenomenon that brought the most serious risk to pilots' safety was a thunderstorm. Thus, Watson Watt's first task was to predict the locations and times of thunder storms. Knowing the connection between atmospheric noise and disturbing weather conditions, he proposed in 1915 to experiment on thunderstorm forecasting with radio direction finders and led a group to conduct such experiments at the ministry's radio station in Aldershot, England.23 Throughout the second half of the 1910s, Watson Watt and his colleagues at the Meteorological Office used the most updated direction finders to tri angulate the locations of atmospherics sources, and compared them with the locations of thunderstorms. They enacted twelve receiving stations represent ing distinct regions of the British Isles, obtained thousands of records from measurements at these stations and conducted statistical analysis to find regu lar patterns that could be helpful to forecasting. In doing so, the unwanted noise to radio engineers became wanted signals to meteorologists.24 Initially, the Meteorological Office was interested only in thunderstorms. But Watson Watt found that the thunderstorm was not the only possible meteorological cause of atmospherics, which also often correlated with other types of weather phenomena. After 1916, the meteorological events under consideration comprised six kinds: thunderstorms within 250 kilometres, thunderstorms within 1000 kilometres, hail showers within 200 kilometres, passing showers within a similar distance, squalls and rainfall.25 Watson Watt compared the atmospherics' directional data with the weather reports in the British Isles, Southern and Western Europe and North Africa. The statist ical analysis of the data obtained from April 1916 to April 1918 showed that the 36 percent of atmospherics sources geographically overlapped with thunderstorms, suggesting that thunderstorms were indeed a major source of atmospherics. Yet the analysis also showed that rain without thunder and lightning also had a strong correlation with atmospherics. More than 70 per cent of atmospherics sources located in rainy regions - with or without</page><page sequence="14">7 6 The Sound and Shapes of Noise thunder. Rainfall rather than lightning seemed to be the dominant factor inducing atmospheric electric disturbances at radio frequencies.26 Up to this point, because of his preoccupation with weather forecasting, Watson Watt's program focused on measuring the locations of atmospheric noise sources. Yet, he broadened the scope of his atmospherics investigation after World War I, as the whole research program was transferred from the Meteorological Office to the newly established British Radio Research Board and moved from Aldershot to the board's research station in Ditton Park near Oxford.27 Although Watson Watt continued to study atmos pherics' meteorological correlations from direction-finding data, under the new institutional affiliation he started to investigate the waveforms of the radio noise using a cutting-edge visual-display instrument: the cathode-ray oscilloscope. As early as the eighteenth century, savants and engineers introduced apparatuses to trace the temporal changes of air temperature and pressure in steam engines. Throughout the nineteenth century, a plethora of similar instruments were developed to represent the 'waveforms' of measured results in a graphic manner via electrical, magnetic, mechanical or optical means. A lot of these curve-tracing apparatuses had the function of recording the dis played waveforms, which Anson Rabinbach dubbed 'devices of mechanical inscription'.28 The curve-tracing apparatuses found extensive use in electrical engineering, acoustics and physiology. In electrical engineering, Charles Wheatstone's rotating mirror first demonstrated the oscillatory character of electric spark, while Jules Joubert s rotating-contact method facilitated moni toring the transient fluctuations of an electric power system. In acoustics, Rudolph Kônig's vibrograph and Alexander Graham Bell's phoneautograph translated sound vibration into curves. In physiology, the boom of measuring graphs - including Karl Ludwig's kymograph, Hermann Helmholtz's myo graph and Etienne-Jules Marey's geometric chronograph - revolutionised the field.29 Two inventions in the last years of the nineteenth century afterwards dominated the art of curve tracers. The oscillograph, developed during the 1890s by William Duddell in England and André Eugène Blondel in France, tracked rapidly oscillating signals. The occilograph's input signal controlled a rotating mirror, which projected a fixed beam of light onto a photographic film. The trace of the light's spot on the film indicated the temporal variation of the signal. German Karl Ferdinand Braun's develop ment of the oscilloscope in 1896, in which the input signal deflected a beam of cathode rays projected on a florescent screen, thus forming a bright curve on the screen.30 Braun's invention was made possible by two earlier German physicists who identified the cathode ray - an invisible beam of radiation in an electrically biased glass tube - as early as the 1850s, and which, in turn,</page><page sequence="15">Chen-Pang Yeang 7 7 inspired Englishman William Crookes's invention in 1878 of the 'Crookes tube' for experimenting with the cathode ray. Studying the history of the curve tracers from the steam-engine indicator to the oscilloscope would be a book-length project. For my purpose, only two points about such graphical apparatuses need to be mentioned. First, the visual characteristic of the method indicates its membership in a longstanding 'image' or 'homo morphic' tradition - using Peter Galison's term - in experimental science; it aimed at 'representation of natural processes in all their fullness and com plexity.'31 In this tradition, the visual evidence produced from the graphical method was supposed to be 'direct', free of inference and comprehensive. Second, compared with other visual measuring instruments, the curve tracers were particularly good at demonstrating, qualitatively and quantitatively, the time relations of the measured effects. In other words, the waveform dis players were the right instruments to measure the elapsed times, periods of oscillation or durations between events in observable physical or biological phenomena. Watson Watt first considered the cathode-ray oscilloscope when he pro posed using it as the visual display of atmospherics direction-finding output in 1919. The Meteorological Office did not succeed in replacing the mechanical mechanical oscillograph with a cathode-ray oscilloscope, for it lacked a cathode-ray tube fast enough to capture instantaneous atmos pherics. As he broadened his focus to atmospherics' waveforms, a fast cathode-ray tube more essential. In November 1922, he knew from O. Webb of the Institution of Electrical Engineers that F. Gill from Western Electric had brought two newly developed fast cathode-ray tubes to the Institution. He rushed to the Institution's building at Savoy Place, London, and found that Edward Appleton at Cavendish Laboratory had borrowed one. He bor rowed the other, and started to collaborate with Appleton on the study of atmospherics' waveforms.32 Watson Watt and Appleton proceeded to develop a method to measure atmospheric noise waveforms using the high-speed cathode-ray tubes. They coupled the received atmospherics signal from the antenna to a vacuum-tube amplifier and then to the cathode-ray oscilloscope's vertical electrodes. The oscilloscope's horizontal electrodes were connected to a triode oscillator with a scan frequency between 100 and 15000 Hz. The cathode-ray oscilloscope displayed curves tracing the variation of the atmospherics' field intensity with time. The oscilloscope's refreshing period determined by the oscillating fre quency 100-15000 Hz was 66.6 to 10000 microseconds, enough to accom modate an atmospheric pulse (~1000 microseconds) (Figure 2).33 Watson Watt, Appleton, and their colleagues made a preliminary test on 22 November, 1922, and conducted the actual experiment from 22 December to 12 February, 1923. They collected hundreds of atmospherics</page><page sequence="16">78 The Sound and Shapes of Noise waveform records and _ L J n classified them into two Cathode Ray. \Oscillograph types; the 'aperiodic' (A) type, in which the field change in the cathode ray tube's vertical plates was in one direction only; and the 'quasi periodic' (Q) type, in which the field change was first in one direction and then in the other direction. The A type was further classified Figure 2. Watson-Watt and Appleton's oscilloscopic recorder. From into A+/A- groups in R.A. Watson-Watt and E.V.

Plate of the condenser connected to the an tenna became more positive at first, and the Q_type was similarly classified into Q+/Qr groups. They also classified the atmospherics waveforms in terms of the rate of field change: those with convex waveforms were distinct from those with wedged concave waveforms.34 They measured the principal constants of every atmospheric waveform, including the peak value(s), the mean value, the mean duration and the ratio of the positive duration to the negative duration. They also performed statistical analysis for each waveform type and gave average values for the principal constants (Figure 3).35 Watson Watt and Appleton's cathode-ray oscilloscope provided a new way to measure atmospherics. In contrast to the ear-balancing method, which relied on a measurer's aural perception, the curves displayed on the screen of the tube were a visual representation of atmospherics radiation. Their classes of atmospherics were associated with visual attributes of waveforms (periodic, aperiodic, positive, negative, round and peaked, plus the tilting angle), rather than aural attributes of noise (grinding, hissing, snapping and crashing). Note that Watson Watt's et al. cathode-ray oscilloscope was not yet a mechanical inscriber in the 1920s. The atmospherics waveforms displayed on the screen as florescent, bright curves lasted for only a very short period of time and left no record or trace. The British researchers had to copy down those curves quickly on paper while they were still visible on the screen. This practice certainly introduced the measurer's perceptive factors and depended upon his craft skills of image recognition and drawing, and to rectify this problem, in the early 1930s, Watson Watt and his collaborators succeeded in .Cathode Ray Oscillograph Figure 2.

By the latter part of the decade, photography had replaced drawing to record data in Watson Watt's atmospherics research.36 The assistance of photography had turned the oscilloscope into a device also of mechanical inscription.</page><page sequence="18">80 The Sound and Shapes of Noise To Watson Watt's contemporaries, the visual display had a clear advantage over the ear-balancing method in atmospherics analysis, for it possessed a presumed directness, objectivity and freedom from personal equations. While scientists and engineers were well aware of the perceptive factors of the ear-balancing scheme and discussed their effects on the precision of measurement, there were no such discussions among researchers of atmos pheric noise regarding the possible physiological bias in oscilloscopic measurement. Even though the oscilloscopic display also relied on one of the human measurer's senses, the researchers simply did not find any optical illu sions in the displayed waveforms that should be incorporated to calibrate data. This did not mean that visual display was a naturally superior method to ear balancing. In fact, it had a problem that was absent in ear balancing. Simply put, the visual display seemed to produce more information than was necessary for noise measurement. While the aural comparison only yielded the average intensity of noise, the oscilloscope demonstrated the entire wave form of the noise's supposedly instantaneous variation over time. Why should engineers or scientists need to know details of noise such as the amplitudes, durations and the shapes of its peaks, troughs and plateaus? Even though it might be a virtue to represent a measurable process in its fullness and complexity and honour a tradition in image experimentation, those details nonetheless seemed to have had neither scientific nor practical im plications to physicists or engineers. In radio and telephone engineering, measuring the average intensity of noise was adequate for gauging system performance and designing interference-robust systems. In atmospheric science and electronic physics, no theories yet required more empirical in formation about noise than its average intensity. Given this condition, then, why should the researchers bother using the more expensive and delicate oscilloscope, instead of staying with the simpler and cheaper ear-balancing instrument? Watson Watt thought about this question, and one of his answers was that the extra information the visual approach provided had an implication to the physical study of atmospherics. Specifically, the waveforms of atmospheric noise pulses resembled those of electric discharge. This indicated that one might be able to understand the discharge processes in thunderclouds or the upper atmosphere by studying atmospherics' waveforms. With the participa tion of John F. Herd, an old colleague of his from the Meteorological Office, Watson Watt's research on the waveforms of atmospherics continued until 1926. He, Appleton and Herd obtained an abundance of measured data and explained some results with Scottish meteorogist Charles Thompson Rees Wilson's nascent theory of thunder cloud electricity.37</page><page sequence="19">Chen-Pang Yeang This concentration on atmospheric waveforms later evolved into a detailed examination of waveform components' time relations. Facilitated by the photographic recording of oscilloscopic traces, Watson Watt, Herd and F.E. Lutkin collected more data on atmospherics in the Middle East and Northern Africa during the 1930s. From these records, they identified two components in a typical atmospherics waveform: a faster pulse with higher oscillating frequencies followed by a slower pulse with lower oscillating fre quencies. To Watson Watt, et al., the major quantitative information obtained from the waveforms comprised the difference of the arriving times between the two pulses, their frequency components and the ratio of their amplitudes.38 Another answer to the question regarding the need for the additional information about waveforms gained by using the oscilloscope had to do with Watson Watt's et al. original mission of locating the meteorological sources of atmospherics. The oscilloscope turned out to be a powerful tool for direction finding. The use of the high-speed cathode-ray tube enabled not only the visual display of atmospherics' waveforms, but also the determina tion of the direction from which it arrived. In 1923, Watson Watt and his colleagues succeeded in an experiment in Aldershot on oscilloscopic direc tion finding of atmospherics. In his setup, he connected two mutually orthogonal antennas (the so-called Belini-Tosi direction finder) to the oscilloscope's horizontal and vertical electrodes. As a result, the incoming atmospherics incurred a somewhat tilted oscillatory waveform on the cathode-ray screen; the tilting angle indicated the atmospherics' angle of arriving direction.39 Three years later, they applied the same principle, albeit with a mechanical-optical oscillograph rather than a cathode-ray oscillo scope, to develop an automatic direction recorder for atmospheric noise.40 All these considerations about the additional information retrieved from visual display in noise measurement played an important role in the begin ning of Britain's World War II era radar project. Anticipating war with Nazi Germany and a significant role for air battles in such a conflict, the U.K. Air Ministry consulted Watson Watt in 1935 about the possibility of producing a certain 'death ray' - strong electromagnetic pulses that could shoot down airplanes. Watson Watt denied the possibility after making calculations and, instead, proposed that electromagnetic waves could be used to detect and locate enemy aircraft. In the same year, he presented a memorandum to the Air Ministry on 'radio ranging and detection' (later, radar). Watson Watt's idea of radar was based on the principle of bouncing electromagnetic waves off a target, not detecting the electromagnetic radiation from the source of interest, as did the atmospherics measurement. But the cathode-ray tube used in the latter could provide a precise means for the former to determine the target location. In his memorandum, Watson Watt claimed that the</page><page sequence="20">82 The Sound and Shapes ofNoise oscilloscopic direction finder in his atmospherics research could be used to measure the direction of radar's echo pulse. Moreover, the range of a target could be determined by gauging the returning time of the echo pulse on the screen of the cathode-ray tube. The target's angle of elevation could also be estimated via an arrangement similar to direction finding. Watson Watt's proposed combination of pulse-echo sensing, direction finding, range find ing and elevation finding became the technological backbone of Chain Home, the U.K.'s first working early-warning radar system that helped deter the German air attacks during the Battle of Britain.41 CONCLUSION In this paper, I have examined two approaches to the empirical investigation of noise during the interwar years. Both approaches aimed to quantify noise, and both involved measurement. But their routes to quantification and measurement were quite different. In the ear-balancing method, noise still appeared as disharmonious sound - grinding, hissing, crashing and snapping. In the visual display method, noise shook off its residual sonic attributions and appeared as fluctuating curves on the screen or film. Inheriting the rationale and sensibility of telephone engineering, the ear-balancing method gauged the effects of noise on the output audibility of telecommunication systems, placed humans at the centre of measurement, and took physiology of senses into account. Coming from the longstanding tradition of curve tracing and attaching closely to the meteorological investigations in weather forecasting and geophysics, the visual display method gauged directly the physical effects of noise and boasted its 'objectivity' and freedom from per sonal equations by not assigning an explicit role for humans in the measur ing process. Moreover, the ear-balancing method measured the average intensity of noise, and its users often employed radio or telephone receivers as variable filters to obtain the average noise intensity at different fre quencies. By contrast, the visual display method promised to offer richer information from the noise traces, even though the quantitative details of these curves were not used until researchers' focus turned to the measure ment of time relations, a task in which the graphical method had specialised. In brief, these two approaches represented quite different attitudes toward the ontology of noise and the right way to quantify it as well as the part which humans played in measuring noise. Neither of the two methods survived long in noise measurement. As the technology of detectors and vacuum tubes progressed, the ear-balancing method gradually yielded to more automatic schemes. By the late 1920s, many engineers undertaking electronic and atmospheric noise measurements replaced the local signal generator and the earphone comparator with the</page><page sequence="21">Chen-Pang Yeang 83 high-gain tube amplifier and sensitive galvanometer. Powerful amplifiers intensified the originally weak noise so it was strong enough for the galvan ometer to detect. With the new instruments, the magnitude of noise was now 'directly' measurable through electrical means without having to appeal to its effects on human hearing. The oscilloscopic and oscillographic display did not fare better, either, as the methods did not really disseminate beyond the British Radio Research Board. The increasingly popular statistical theory of noise was indeed consistent with the visual methods implication that noise was abstract variations of certain quantities over time and representable by fluctuating curves. But this theory of informational noise did not need the information the curves' detailed shapes; instead, it only needed some statis tical quantities associated with those curves. The metrology of noise since the 1940s was thus preoccupied with measurables stipulated by statistical theory, such as the power spectral density and correlation function, and the instruments for measuring them, such as the spectrum analyser. However, both the ear-balancing method and the visual display method left important legacies for informational science and engineering. The ear balancing method continued to play a significant part in AT&amp;T's research on speech analysis and synthesis, phonetics and psychoacoustics before and dur ing World War II.42 Watson Watt's atmospherics oscilloscope led him to conceive and build the world's first functioning radar in the 1930s, which opened up an electronic frontier during the war. Both set the stage for a cybernetic worldview in which the sounds and shapes of noise were nothing but indices of mathematically modelled random processes. NOTES 1 C.
