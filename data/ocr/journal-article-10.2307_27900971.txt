<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS 635 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM HE abundance of expert literature on the Theory of Relativity JL has much contributed to clear the fog away from most of the fundamental principles of the theory. But while mathematicians and physicists tend more and more towards a general accord con cerning Relativity, philosophers widely diverge in their interpreta tions of the metaphysical aspect of the new physics. A very strong position seems to have been secured by idealism through the remark able essays of Prof. Wildow Carr.1 But if the rational synthesis he has prescribed appeals to imagination and is philosophically pos sible, the mathematics of Relativity seems to offer little ground for such an interpretation. The Principle of Relativity is not a unique crucial fact to decide between idealism and realism, and in no respect whatever is it idealistic or realistic in any sense in which any other physical principle is not. But a close examination of Einstein's theory will rather show that idealism can only give a particular meaning to the Principle of Relativity, or try to determine the epistemological implications of it, without attempting an adequate discusson of the significance of the mathematical counterpart on which Einstein bases his comments and verbal enunciations. Consequently, the period of philosophical misinterpretation of the Principle of Rela tivity, as stated in pure science, will continue as long as philosophers refuse to consider a few simple mathematical expressions whose quantitative invariance is all-important in the problems at issue. In the first place, the meaning of a four-dimensional continuum and of the distance-interval between two points, must thoroughly be grasped, for otherwise, the statement of the theory to the philoso pher would resolve itself into a disquieting account of changes, according to position and motions, of things which are usually regarded as invariant, such as the length of the standard metre rod 1 Cf.

There is nothing occult about the four-dimensional continuum. When we consider the universe of events that happen to particles of matter, these events form a continuum in both space and time, and everyone of them has to be characterized by four numbers, three of which give its position in space, while the remaining one denotes the time of the event. But the distance-intervals of the space continuum and the instant-intervals of the time continuum are not absolute in them selves and independent of one another, as it was universally assumed before the advent of Einstein's theory. Space and time are relative to each other, and only when their elements are so combined as to form invariants, their amalgamation constitutes a unique and neces sary world, a universe more absolute than that of the classical phys ics, because of the essential duality of the latter. The space that we see then, is only a three-dimensional facet of this four-dimen sional universe; we see different facets as we change our motion, and the mathematical theory of Relativity shows us how to join them together in the four-dimensional whole, just as we join men tally in a three-dimensional picture the various two-dimensional aspects of the same mountains seen on the horizon from different parts of a country. There is, of course, the important distinction that the four-dimensional universe as apprehended by us, is an intellec tual synthesis with no imaginary counterpart. The absoluteness of the four-dimensional continuum is empha sized by the uniqueness of the distance-interval between two events. To make this idea clear, let us consider first a euclidean three-dimen sional continuum: between any two points in space there lies a necessary and unique path, the distance-interval, expressed by three coordinates independent of time. The absoluteness of that unique path is claimed only when the three coordinates, or their equivalent, are taken together. The possible variation of each of the coordi nates taken separately, necessarily changes the value of the distance element ; so that the coordinates are not absolute in themselves, but relative to one another. It is their combination which is absolute, and whatever be the variation of the one or the other, it is always possible to compensate these variations betwen themselves, so as to leave invariant the value of the group of coordinates taken as one whole. Then we may change the three coordinates of a distance interval by changing the orientation or the position of the axes of</page><page sequence="3">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS 637 reference, but the distance-interval remains unchangeable and con stant. The same thing happens in a four-dimensional space-time con tinuum, be it euclidean as Minkowskis universe, which is nothing but rays of light and small elastic bodies, moving freely or colliding, but without gravitational force, or non-euclidean like Einstein's Riemannian Universe where gravitation is accounted for. In such a space-time world of events, the free tracks of material particles are again necessary and unique tracks ; and this is symbolized by their mathematical counterpart, where the distance-intervals joining any two events are invariant in each case. Such a distance-interval is therefore the absolute standard-measure taken by all observers, whatever be the motion of their particular frame of reference. What differs in the methods of measuring time and space for two or more observers moving relatively to one another, is their particular length unit and their particular time-unit, because there is no such a thing as an absolute space and an absolute time. But when we are discuss ing space and time with regard to the theory of Relativity, we are not allowed to consider them separately, but take them as a univer sal and absolute whole. As in the case of the euclidean three-dimen sional continuum, the variations in the particular space-co?rdinates and time-coordinates of different observers moving relatively to one another, compensate in such a way as to make possible the expres sion of the distance-interval between two events, in terms of a unique space-time continuum and by means of a unique world-line represented mathematically by a unique formula, then, whatever be the degree of dimensionality of the continuum to which the distance between two events is referred, no amount of reasoning will get us away from having to postulate the absoluteness of the interval be tween those two events. On the basis of the interpretations of the mathematical expres sion of the space-time continuum and the distance element, one fails to see on what grounds it can behold that there is no absolute space time system, and that every space-time system is absolute for those attached to it. Indeed, every spatial system is relative to a degree of freedom indeterminable from within, whence the absoluteness of that system from the standpoint of those attached to it ; but, there is no meaning at all in the statement that every space-time system is absolute for those attached to it. What is absolute for all the observ ers belonging to the same system is their particular space and their</page><page sequence="4">638 THE MONIST. particular time : a detached space-time continuum is meaningless for them. Thus, we must imagine each star carrying its own appro priate space and time according to its motion through the ether. The space and time of one star will not fit the experience of individuals on another star. But, 20 ro? essor Eddington says, space-time is the same universally, it is only the orientation, i. e., the resolution into space and time separately, which depends on the motions of the individual, experiencing it, just as the resolution of space into horizontal and vertical depends on his situation. But all this comes to the affirmation of an existence independent of sense experience, to which the subject of experience refers his sensations. There is I:~tlc ground then in saying that the Principle of Relativity accept ^ensation an * perceptions as themselves the Reality, and as the only Reality wk^ which science is concerned. What Einstein set himself to discover by mathematical reasoning was not the systematizations of general uniformities whereby one individual would be able to refer to an object in his experience which corresponds point to point with the object in another individual's experience, but the kind of laws of nature which could regulate a four-dimensional continuum where all natural forces are accounted for. If every individual, every monad is a center of perceptive activ ity coordinating from the standpoint of itself as absolute, the uni verse mirrored in it, then, as Stuart Mill said, the ultimate laws of nature would refer to the qualitative sensations of every monad, and their number would consequently be at least equal to the number of these sensations. But this view is quite the reverse of the actual method of physical science. As Professor Planck remarked it, the characteristic of the evolu tions of physics is, that it digresses more and more from what he calls "anthropomorphic considerations/' that is to say, from the "ego" of the observer. In fact, when a professor delivers a series of lectures on physics, he never makes the slightest reference to the particular sensations and perceptions of the subject of the obser vations and experiments ; on the contrary, every one of his affirma tions conveys an unshaken faith in the existence of things independ ently of sense-perception. And it is a well-known fact in method ology, that a necessary condition of the exactness of experimental methods in the deduction of what is called "the personal equation observations and experiments. With reference to space and time,</page><page sequence="5">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS 639 these categories are to Einstein only convenient ways of fitting observed phenomena into a systematic theory, and the method of measurement is simply the comparison of two such phenomena. The consciousness of space and time is eliminated in conducting exact measurements; so that the measures of space and time are condi tioned by the phenomena which they are used to describe. The human factor arises only in the suggestion and selection of the phe nomena coordinated and in the suggestion of the qualitative distinc tion between space and time. These considerations do not mean, however, that it is possible to describe nature when the mind is gone. The existence only and not the conception of nature exists independently of the mind. Existence as such is an absolute indefinable; because a definition gives only the essence of a thing, and not its existence, for otherwise, anything which we could think of would necessarily exist. What exists in its actual form is not the general, which is only fundamen talste in re, but the particular, which is infinitely diverse. And because the object of knowledge is always general in judgment, no fact ever is just that which it means, or can mean what it is; we never assert the fact in our head, but something else which that fact stands for. While that which is perceived by the senses is paralled out in a series of particular sensations, that which is conceived by the intellect takes the form of unity, of a general idea. Although there is a fundamental duality between the process of thought and nature, there is, however, a certain conformity between our reason and the external world ; not only because the mind itself is a part of Reality but also because it would be an imperfection in the plan of Creation if we were not adapted to the world in which we live in such a way as to make possible not only our material living, but also our intellectual development. The conformity of the order in nature and the order in mind, however, does not take the shape of a geometrical congruence, of a biunivocal point to point correspondence between mind and nature. The finitude of our intel lect, the materialty of our means of knowing, hinder us from pene trating adequately the plan of the world. As knowledge requires the mind as one of its terms, we can understand the relations be tween things and the things themselves only in relation to our sensa tions and our intellect. We know the order in mind, because we are concerned here with possibilities, with formal truth alone; but the ultimate nature of things is an absolute limit towards which we draw</page><page sequence="6">640 TUE MONIST. nearer and nearer asymtotically. And this Reality-Asymptote is not a mere appearance, a refracted image of a higher reality, but Reality itself. Science, therefore, does not give a perfect picture of the Universe; but it expresses true relations between real objects, as in every physical theory there is a certain invariant, which gives its value to science. That invariant, whatever be the nominalistic formalities with which we clothe it, is a part of the Reality-asymptote itself, a segment of it, the length of which increases every day. We do not create that invariant, we create only its expression.2 I am not in a position to give an estimate of the absolute distance between the actual point of our science-curve and its reality-asymp tote because our knowledge is only a particle of that curve which is gradually generating as the world goes on. But even if our science is hopelessly condemned to keep at an insuperable distance from Reality, we must not lose courage in trying to further our knowl edge. Because science has not only a static aim, to-wit, the contem plations of truth as such, but also a dynamic purpose, which is the embetterment and perfection of our material living as well as of our moral life.
