Stucki U.S. DOT NHTSA ABSTRACT The National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis- tration (NHTSA) conducted a program to evaluate improved impact protection for unrestrained drivers. This program was separated into the fol- lowing phases: an initial problem determination phase; an analytical phase to evaluate potential safety concepts; and a hardware development and testing phase to evaluate safety designs in sled and crash tests. The main objective of this program was the development of steering assembly designs which reduce injury measures for unrestrained drivers in crash impact simulations and which are production feasible. The program was initiated prior to implementation of FMVSS 208 by NHTSA and does not reflect the injury and fatality savings afforded restrained occupants. This paper specifically addresses the hardware development and testing phase of this program that was performed under NHTSA Contract by the Calspan Corporation Advanced Technology Center in Buffalo, NY. For continuity, a description of the problem determination and the analytical modelling phases of the program are provided below. THE PROBLEM DETERMINATION phase compiled accident data on injuries and |atalities from impact with the steering assembly (1) . Several conclusions were reached through this analysis: • The steering assembly is the source of nearly 60% of the economic cost associated with unrestrained drivers in frontal accidents. Injuries to the thorax and abdomen make up over 80% of this cost (NCSS file). • Most cars with column energy absorber (EA) units experience little or no column compression in frontal accidents above 20 mph (32 km/hr) velocity change (Collision Performance and Injury Report, CPIR, File). • Cars are able to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 203, "Impact Protection for the Driver from the Steering Control System", in many cases, with little or no column compression (2). ANALYTICAL MODELLING OF STEERING ASSEMBLY IMPROVEMENTS The procedure for the analytical evaluation of steering assembly safety concepts was: 1) select a baseline "fleet" of cars comprised of high production make/models for 1975 to 1981 model years; 2) develop computer model input sets for this baseline population of cars; 3) conduct computer simulations of unrestrained drivers in frontal accidents for the baseline car fleet; 4) compare modelling results with accident statistics to give credence to the analysis; and 5) introduce steering assembly safety concepts into the baseline car population and predict potential reductions in injuries and fatalities. BASELINE CAR "FLEET" - Retail sales figures were compiled along with groupings of different makes/models with common dimensions and physical properties, e.g., General Motors "X" body cars is a group. From this a vehicle "fleet" consisting of 27 car groups was established, 23 which represented about 60 percent of the 1975 through 1981 car sales and four 1983 cars of interest (Table 1). MODEL DESCRIPTION - The PADS (Passenger And Driver Simulation) computer model was selected for simulating the unrestrained driver in frontal impacts, because of its detailed steering assembly description but otherwise modest input requirements (3). PADS is a two-dimensional model with a four mass (head/neck, torso, lower body, and sternum) occupant and compartment geometry defined by seven contact planes and steering ♦Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. 691</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 - List of Baseline Cars Group Model No. Year(s) Make/Model Chrysler 1 76-80 Aspen/ Volare 2 77-81 Lebaron/Cordoba/Imperial 3 75-76 Dart/Valiant 4 78-81 Omni/Horizon Ford 5 75-80 Pinto /Bobcat 6 78-81 Fairmont/Zephyr 7 79-81 Mustang/Capri 8 79-81 Ford/Mercury 9 81 Granada/Monarch 10 80-81 Thunderbird/Cougar General Motors 11 78-81 Malibu/Cutlass 12 77-81 Chevrolet 13 80-81 Citation/etc. 14 77-81 LeSabre/etc. 15 75-80 Monza/etc. 16 75-79 Nova/etc. 17 76-81 Chevette/TlOOO 18 75-81 Camaro/Firebird Imports 19 75-81 Honda Civic 20 75-81 Toyota Corolla 21 75-81 Subaru 22 75-81 Datsun 23 79-81 Volkswagen Rabbit New Models 24 83 Renault Fuego 25 83 AMC Concord 26 83 Chevrolet Celebrity 27 83 Honda Accord assembly (Figure 1). In addition to geometry, mechanical properties for contact planes include force-deflection, damping and friction. The steering assembly geometry, dimensions and physical properties are defined to closely simulate load application during driver impact. Force- deflection properties are input for the column energy absorber and for various impact locations on the steering wheel including upper rim for head, mid and upper rim for shoulder, lower rim for abdomen, entire rim for whole thorax, and hub for chest. Wheel torque-rotation at the column attach- ment point is also required as input. The user must also define the occupant segment masses, lengths and contact circle radii. A validation of the PADS model with sled test results was conducted and showed reasonable correlation (3). DEVELOPMENT OF MODEL INPUT - Input data sets for PADS simulations were developed for all 27 vehicles. Mechanical properties and geometry of the vehicle compartment were collected by the Transportation Systems Center (TSC) in Boston. Occupant properties were provided by NHTSATs Biomechanics Division. Crash pulses were extra- polated from New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and other NHTSA tests. TSC conducted static force-deflection testing on steering wheels and columns at the Army Material and Mechanics Research Center near 7 Contact Planes 1 - Seat Back 2 - Seat Bottom 3 - Lower IP 4 - Middle IP 5 - Upper IP 6 - Windshield 7 - Header hub, ^^,^^Shear Capsule ' Lfw _ v' '' Firewall °c Rbf^J^ Lbf Fa, Fn , M o = Applied Forces and Moment R ge » Rba» Rbf = Rea°tlon Forces; |jl = Friction Coefficient Figure 1 PADS occupant, compartment and steering assembly Boston (4). The following tests were conducted to define the PADS required mechanical properties: - Steering column axial loading with and without a 250 pound (1112 newtons) force normal to column. - Steering wheel bottom tangential loading (normal to wheel plane). - Steering wheel top tangential loading. - Steering wheel bottom radial loading (in the wheel plane toward center). - Steering wheel hub tangential loading. - Whole steering wheel tangential loading. - Steering wheel torque-rotation. PADS steering assembly force-deflection properties which were not tested were extrapolated from these results. Force-deflection data for the wheel top radial loading were assumed to have the same as the wheel bottom radial loading. In addi- tion, the tangential and radial properties from shoulder loadings were assumed to have the same 692</page><page sequence="3">characteristics as those of the wheel top. Informa- tion on physical properties of the lower instrument panel, windshield, header, seat bottom and back was gleaned from various NHTSA test results, but was limited and had to be applied to the entire vehicle fleet. Compartment geometry for the 27 cars was also measured and recorded for input by TSC. Anthropometry measurements were provided by NHTSA!s Biomechanics division from the advanced dummy program for three occupant sizes: 5th percentile female, 50th and 95th percentile males (5). These data were then extrapolated to fit the simplified geometry and mass descriptions of the PADS model. Additional mechanical properties of the occupant were taken from research by Kroell, et al., (6,7) and Hybrid HI dummy characteristics developed from this research (8). Crash pulses for each vehicle were extrapolated from NCAP 35 mph (56 km/hr) barrier tests to other test speeds and conditions. Routines were developed by TSC to simulate 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mph (16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 km/hr) barrier tests in addition to the standard 35 mph (56 km/hr) NCAP test. These routines also produced pulses for full frontal, offset and narrow (pole type) impacts in the. 15 to 35 mph (24 to 56 km/hr) impact speed range. The complete injury assessment of the fleet included simulations of the 27 vehicles with three occupant sizes and 18 crash pulses (six velocities X three configurations) for a total of 1458 runs. This analyses was conducted for baseline properties and for two sets of improvements to estimate potential benefits. A complete discussion of this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, but may be found in Reference (9). EVALUATION OF PROPERTIES - The main objective in this program was mitigation of chest and abdominal injuries to unrestrained drivers from steering assembly impact. The effect of steering assembly characteristics on driver injury was examined by varying the properties of the column, steering wheel, and instrument panel. Properties of the column which lead to injury mitigation include maximized energy absorption (EA) at force levels below injury thresholds. In this study, injury mitigation properties included column designs with long stroking EA units and square wave response to maximize EA, low friction, binding or velocity dependent forces, and low mass to reduce inertia effects. The optimum steering wheel design is one which reduces both chest and abdominal loadings, requirements which may be contradictory. In deter- mining safer designs, it is assumed that a wheel with a deep dished hub and a stiff rim will reduce chest impact at the expense of higher loads and deeper penetration of the abdomen. Since the abdo- men is the softest body region, priority must be given to a rim which deforms at fairly low force levels. Also, it was assumed that chest protection should be provided by hub recession and padding, increased wheel contact area and low wheel mass. The knee contact panel also plays an important role in controlling occupant kinematics and energy absorption. Based on measured fleet force-deflection properties, a parameter was developed in an attempt to quantify the injury influencing properties of the column and each body region/contract area, i.e., head/upper rim, chest/hub, abdomen/lower rim, and femurs/knee panel. The individual parameters were then combined into a total parameter for the steering assembly and overall compartment. The parameter does not include energy management from the vehicle structure or surfaces other than those given above. This parameter, computed for each of the 27 vehicles, accounted for EA poten- tial, maximum force, and EA efficiency (9) (a measure of "closeness" to a square wave force- deflection response). Simulations were conducted on the vehicles from Table 1 using the PADS model, with a 50th percentile male occupant, and full frontal crash pulses for all velocities. Chest and abdominal de- flection (the selected injury criteria for analytical modelling) and steering assembly and compartment parameters were compared for correlation, along with other properties including column friction, damping, and angle, wheel/column weight, and hub recess. There was no strong correlation with injury measures for any of the parameters or properties in the 27 vehicles. There was some correlation between chest deflection and the steering assembly parameter with the lowest injury occurring in the highest ranked car and vice versa for the other extreme. Apparently, the combined influence of all properties outweighs individual effects for the selected properties. In order to isolate the contributions of single parameters and combinations of parameters, simulations were conducted on a single make/model vehicle. Properties which produced reductions in injury measures included a four pound (18 newton) wheel/column weight, four inches (10 centimeters) of hub recess, zero column friction and damping, and improved force-deflection properties for the wheel, column, and knee restraint (Figure 2). These properties were combined into an improved steering assembly hereafter referred to as Benefit 1. A steering assembly, composed of a production column and wheel from cars with the highest parameter rankings for these components, was also assessed. This steering assembly, termed Benefit 2, also included zero friction and damping and a 4-inch (10 cm) hub recess. Originally, Benefit 2 consisted of a late 70Ts Toyota Corolla column and a Volkswagen Rabbit steering wheel. Subsequent information from the testing program resulted in selecting a 1979 Ford Granada as the preferred column. The Benefit 1 wheel also replaced the Rabbit wheel since the properties after modification for hub recess were almost identical. The final Benefit 2 steering assemblies system was a Bene- fit 1 wheel and a Granada column with no other changes. PADS modelling was conducted on the Ford Granada and Chevrolet Citation in baseline configurations and with Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 steering assemblies replacing the production components. The simulations used a 50th percentile male in full frontal crashes at 25 and 30 mph (40 and 48 km/hr).

Deflection Figure 2 Benefit 1 properties produced significant reductions in all chest and abdominal injury measurements (chest deflection and gTs, and abdominal deflections) for the Citation at both speeds (Figure 3). The Granada simulation at 25 mph (40 km/hr) encountered a fatal run error prior to significant contact and loading and, therefore, is not included. The Benefit 1 and 2 systems in the Granada showed some improvement in chest and abdominal deflection, but a slight increase in chest głs over the baseline configuration. Based on the encouraging results of the modelling, the next phase of the steering assembly protection program was to develop the Benefit 1 and 2 systems in the laboratory. Sled testing was then conducted to assess the performance in a more realistic representation of an actual crash. A program flow chart, presented in Figure 4, indicates the various tasks that are discussed in the following Phase IE sections. As shown, the program begins with the development and static component testing of Benefit 1 and 2 systems and the modified systems, followed by the fabrication of sled bucks and assembling of all the steering system parts. The final tasks were the sled testing of baseline steering assemblies and of Benefit 1 and 2 systems, and finally the testing of the modified steering Figure 3 Occupant responses in PADS simulation assemblies. A complete description of the Phase in work addressed in this paper, performed by the Calspan Corporation Advanced Technology Center, is presented in Reference (10). HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT FOR IMPROVED STEERING ASSEMBLIES The two special steering system designs, designated Benefit 1 and Benefit 2, were developed and statically tested in this phase of work.

Benefit 1 was designed to meet specific perfor- mance criteria while being constructed of the lightest material possible. The Benefit 2 system was similar to Benefit 1 in that it utilized a Benefit 1 steering wheel attached to a high performance production steering column. THE BENEFIT 1 STEERING SYSTEM - The Benefit 1 steering wheel was constructed from a production 1976 Plymouth Valiant wheel. The 6 oTclock spoke and entire hub assembly were removed from the basic wheel, leaving the rim and the 2 and 10 o'clock position spokes. Both production spokes and a substitute modified spoke having the same geometry as its original counterpart were then welded to the top surface of a 5-inch (12.7 cm) diameter steel plate. The final design, shown in Figure 5, used a 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) diameter steel rod for the 6 oTclock spoke, which contained an ultimate tensile strength of 100,000 psi (689,500 kPa). This wheel configuration measured approximately 463 inches (11.7 cm) from the top hub surface to the top plane of the unpadded rim. The dish effect of the final wheel design, including hub load cell and padding, measured 3.25 inches (8.3 cm) from top of hub to rim. The 695 weight of the wheel was 4.27 lbs (1.94 kg) including pads. Quasi-static steering wheel compression tests were conducted in both the tangential direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of the rim) and radial direction (i.e., in the plane of the rim). Force exerted by a hydraulic cylinder was applied to the rim at the 6 oTclock postion and the resulting force-deflection graphs are presented in Figure 5 along with the required curves. The tangential test result was a fair approximation to the requirement. The radial test showed an even closer performance level to the specification curve. Figure 5 Radial and tangential force-deflection response of Benefit 1 steering wheel</page><page sequence="6">The Benefit 1 column design was based on theoretical maximum loadings of 1200 lbs (5.34 kN) axial load and an end moment of 10,000 in-lbs. (1,130 N-m). To accommodate these assumed loads, a straight thin-walled steel tube was selected. In the case of a tube with an outside diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and a wall thickness of 0.065 inches (1.65 mm), the maximum tensile stress was calculated to be approximately 99,400 psi (685,360 kPa). For sufficient strength of the steering column to absorb these loads and not yield during testing, an alloy steel seamless tubing was selected. The tube was then heat-treated to a hardness level of Rockwell Rc 30-40 so that it possessed a higher yield stress of approximately 117,000 psi (806,700 kPa) but still contained some ductility. Two four-inch (10.2 cm) long linear bearings were selected to guide the Benefit 1 column in an axial direction. The arrangement of the column and bearings is shown in the sketch of the Benefit 1 system in Figure 6. The weight of the finished steel column, 22 in. (55.9 cm) long, was 1.69 lbs (0.77 kg). As shown in the layout of the Benefit 1 system in Figure 6, the lower end contained an aluminum honeycomb energy absorber. System energy was absorbed via aluminum honeycomb crush by a stepped cylinder-shaped aluminum cutter attached to the lower end of the column. The cutter had a maximum diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm) followed by three succeedingly smaller diameter cylinders. Progressive stroking over the first three inches of column displacement permitted larger cutter areas to engage the honeycomb top surface, producing a gradual increase in force up to 1200 lbs (5.34 kN). After three inches of stroke, the force remained constant at the desired 1200 lb level. The Benefit 1 steering system final design con- tained component weights of 3.57 lbs (1.62 kg) for the column, 3.13 lbs (1.42 kg) for the steering wheel and 1.14 lbs (0.52 kg) for the rim pads, horn button disc and horn pad. The total system weight without instrumentation was 7.84 lbs (3.56 kg). Static crush tests with a simulated dummy knee form were performed to develop knee restraints for the Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 systems. The selected material, which produced acceptable constant force levels of approximately 1500 lbs (6.67 kN) at deflections of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm), was an aluminum honeycomb, type 3/8-5052-.002. THE BENEFIT 2 STEERING SYSTEM - The final design of the Benefit 2 steering system was composed of a Benefit 1 steering wheel bolted to the top of a 1979 Ford Granada energy absorbing column, shown to exhibit good energy absorbing properties from previous tests. The Granada column was essentially a steel tube with an upper slip joint support and a lower tube support incorporating energy-absorbing tube deformers. The energy- absorbing mechanism contained a maximum stroke distance of approximately 7 in. (17.8 cm). The weight of the total Benefit 2 system, including the steering rim and horn disc and pads, but without instrumentation, was 9.13 lbs (4.14 kg). STATIC TESTS OF STANDARD SYSTEM COMPONENTS - The two basic production vehicles that were employed in this program were the 1981 Chevrolet Citation and the 1979 Ford Granada, selected on the basis of the NHTSA Phase n work (9). The first task was to statically test several steering components from both cars to establish baseline data. The Citation steering wheel and energy- absorbing column are shown in Figure 7 and the Granada steering components are pictured in Figure 8. The upper collapsible (moveable) section of the energy-absorbing (EA) Citation column weighed 10.46 lbs (4.74 kg), the lower nonmoveable tube weighed 2.35 lbs (1.07 kg), and the steering wheel was 5.60 lbs (2.54 kg). These components added to a total steering assembly weight of 18.41 lbs (8.35 kg). The EA column itself, stripped of all the wires and plastic sections, weighed 4.76 lbs (2.16 kg) (Figure 7). This lightened configuration was the unit that was tested in the majority of the dynamic sled tests. The Citation steering wheel was a two-spoke design with an outside rim diameter of 15.1 inches REACTION PLATE A1MAil / ALUM.

Static loading tests were performed on the Citation rim to obtain baseline force-deflection data. Rim force- deflection characteristics in the tangential loading direction indicated a peak force of approximately 420 lbs (1.87 kN) at 3.2 inches (8.1 cm) of deflection. Loaded in the radial direction, the rim was much stiff er showing a peak load of 1000 lbs (4.45 kN) at about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of deformation. The Granada steering wheel in Figure 8 was not tested at this point in the program. A Citation column EA unit was axially compressed to determine its stiffness characteris- tics. The column demonstrated considerable variation in loads, from 1450 lbs (6.45 kN) at 1.3 inches (3.3 cm) to about 900 lbs (4.00 kN) at 4.0 inches (10.2 cm) of displacement. Total available stroke was 4.1 inches (10.4 cm). A Granada EA column was tested in the same manner which showed much more consistent forces at a level of approximately 1850 lbs (8.23 kN) over a stroke distance of 6.5 inches (16.5 cm). DESIGN AND TEST OF MODIFIED SYSTEM COMPONENTS - Variations of Standard System Properties - Seven properties of the Citation steering system components were varied during the dynamic sled testing phase. These variables are presented below, showing the approximate values for each of the properties, representing the preferred and the less desirable characteristics based on injury measure mitigation from the previous computer modelling work. Both sets of properties were tested on the sled to determine the characteristics that were actually beneficial. Rim Stiffness - To meet the stiff rim requirements for a basic geometry wheel, a standard Citation wheel was disassembled to obtain the rim portion only. The original spokes and hub assembly were removed and replaced with components fabricated from 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) thick steel plate. A 3.63 inch (9.2 cm) diameter hub was employed along with 1.75 inch (4.4 cm) wide spokes.

Correlation between the force-deflection data generated during the static crush tests in the tangential and radial directions and the stiff rim requirement curves was only fair, as presented in Figure 9. This wheel design was highly unusual in the sense that the radial resistance greatly exceeded the specification force-deflection criteria. The standard geometry Citation wheel incorporating a soft rim was designed from the above noted stiff rim wheel. Spoke widths were reduced to 0.75 inch (1.9 cm) wide units and the gussets were omitted. This design is presented in Figure 10. Tangential direction loading produced the force-deflection response depicted in the upper graph which indicated that the experimental data were close to the theoretical "soft" specification curve. The results of the radial loading test indicated that the rim was somewhat stiffer than the required force level over the first two inches of deflection, followed by a rapid reduction in resistance. Steering Column Stiffness - The low level characteristic for the column stiffness property was set at 1200 lbs (5.34 kN) constant force. Since the standard Citation column stroking force was not consistent with this requirement, the Benefit 1 column EA mechanism, designed to collapse at 1200 lbs force, was employed in its place. The steering column high limit property of being rigid was accomplished by welding two small steel blocks on each side of the Citation column to prevent the upper tube from moving relative to the lower tube. Knee Restraint - In order to match the required force-deflection properties for the soft/production knee restraint, a number of crush tests were performed with a dummy knee form pressed into various materials. The material which produced characteristics closest to the required force- deflection properties was a polystyrene foam of density 1.0 lb/ft ^ (16 kg/m^). At a 3.0 inch (7.6 cm) displacement of the knee form into this material, the resisting force measured 520 lbs (2.31 kN) compared to the required 500 lbs (2.22 kN). Based on these tests, the polystyrene foam was used for all soft or production lower dash panels. The knee restraint possessing the stiff characteristics of 1500 lbs (6.67 kN) constant force was already designed and tested for the Benefit 1 steering system (noted above). This aluminum honeycomb knee restraint was employed whenever the stiff properties were required in the sled testing phase. Hub Recession - The steering wheel having a deep-dish hub recession (nominal 6 inches (15.2 cm) including load cell and padding) was developed with baseline Citation wheel stiffness characteristics. The final version of this wheel is shown in Figure 11. Crush test force-deflection data for the tangen- tial and radial direction loadings on the wheel are also presented in Figure 11. As indicated, the modified wheel results in the tangential direction displayed good correlation with the baseline data, but the radial force-deflection data indicated low force levels. As is the case with all modified rim designs, the stiffness of the rim in the radial direction was of much less importance than the tangential direction because of the direction of impact by the driver where the force was almost normal to the plane of the rim. The radial rim Figure 9 Radial and tangential loadings of modified Citation wheel, standard geometry, stiff rim 698</page><page sequence="9">Figure 10 Radial and tangential loadings of modified Citation wheel, standard geometry, soft rim resistance, therefore, was judged sufficient for this design case. To construct a wheel with a low limit hub recession of approximately zero inches, a hub extension structure was used with the wheel design discussed above as presented in the typical test setup of Figure 12. The hub extension was a welded aluminum tube, with a diameter of two inches (5.1 cm) and a length of 5.88 inches (14.9 cm). This configuration was employed for the "shallow dish" wheel having the stiffness properties of the basic Citation steering wheel. Wheel/Column Mass - The low mass version of the Citation column (a stripped production unit) contained a moveable EA section of 3.76 lbs (1.71 kg) and a total column weight of 4.76 lbs (2.16 kg). The high mass version was obtained by adding weights to the upper EA moving tube, increasing its weight to 10.75 lbs (4.88 kg) for a total column weight of 11.75 lbs (5.33 kg).

These aluminum disks were bolted to the central hub of a production wheel and padded with 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) thick Ensolite material. The larger area disk added approximately 13% to the weight of the steering system which was not sufficiently large to warrant lightening of the steering wheel or column. Steering Column Angle - The angle that the steering column subtends with the local horizontal was considered to be an important parameter in this research. The minimum angle that could be obtained in the Citation buck was 13° because the steering rim (the 6 o!clock rim point) also had to be maintained at an established position relative to the dummy. In the same manner, the column angle was increased to a maximum of 29° while holding the lower rim at a constant position in space. Combinations of Steering System Properties - Following the work of design, fabrication, and testing of components for the basic seven properties, several combinations of these parameters were also constructed and tested as shown in the following tables. Combination Series No. 1 Rim Stiffness Hub Recession Column Angle Stiff Deep 13° Soft Deep 13° Stiff Shallow 13° Soft Shallow 13° Stiff Deep 29° Soft Deep 29° Stiff Shallow 29° Soft Shallow 29° Combination Series No. 2 Wheel/Column Mass Column Stiffness Light 1200 lb const. F Light Rigid Heavy 1200 lb const. F Heavy Rigid The Combination Series No. 1 consisted of three variables: rim stiffness, hub recession, and column angle. All possible combinations of these three parameters were tested, which resulted in a series of eight sled tests. The first steering wheel to be modified contained a deep-dish hub recession with stiff rim properties. The final design utilizing two 1.38 inch (3.5 cm) wide spokes with 34° bends is depicted in Figure 13. The tangential and radial crush characteristics of the deep-dish, stiff rim design are also presented in Figure 13. The properties of the tangential loading were deemed acceptable, since actual rim resistance compared well with the required stiff properties and deflections up to approximately two inches (5.1 cm). As with all of these modified wheel designs, it was difficult to achieve both the tangential and radial required force-deflection properties in the same design. Therefore, most wheel modifications were made with the intent of satisfying mostly the tangential-direction specifica- tion crush properties, since this mode was most important. 700 Figure 13 Radial and tangential loadings of modified Citation wheel, deep-dish, stiff rim The shallow dish steering wheel design, incorporating stiff rim properties, was constructed with the same wheel design as discussed above, but used the previously described aluminum hub extension tube, as shown in Figure 12. The third wheel design in the combination test series was the deep-recession, soft rim wheel, depicted in Figure 14, along with the results of the tangential and radial crush tests. Comparing the stiffness characteristics of this wheel design with the required curves show excellent agreement in the tangential test mode and good results in the</page><page sequence="11">radial mode over the first two inches (5 cm) of deflection. The fourth steering wheel in this series was the shallow-dish, soft rim wheel. In the same manner as employed for previous designs, the extended aluminum tube was used with the soft rim design, discussed above, to produce the zero hub recession wheel. Figure 14 Radial and tangential loadings of modified Citation wheel, deep-dish, soft rim The Combination Series No. 2 of steering wheel properties consisted of two parameters- column mass and column stiffness. Testing all combinations of these two variables would yield four runs, that is, a light column would be tested with a 1200 lb (4.35 kN) constant force design and a rigid column design. It addition, the heavy column would be tested with the same two column stiffness properties. In was decided that after a number of Citation columns had been run, a rigid column would not be tested because it could lead to Hybrid III dummy damage. Consequently, the two remaining tests contained a light column with a 1200 lb constant collapse force and a heavy column with the same compression characteristics. For the case of the light column, the Benefit 1 column was employed because it contained a light stroking section of 3.6 lbs (1.6 kg). The second test employed the Benefit 1 crush mechanism of 1200 lbs. (5.34 kN) but also used a heavy tube of 10.9 lbs (49 kg). This heavy column approximated the weight of the standard Citation EA column stroking section. At this point in the program, all development and testing effort on the modified steering assembly components was completed. This included the designs of the seven single variations in steering system characteristics and the combinations of these various properties. In addition, the Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 special systems were developed, fabricated and ready to be tested. The next task was to dynamically test each of the steering assembly modifications in simulated crash tests on the accelerator sled with 50th percentile Hybrid III dummies. SLED TESTS OF BASELINE AND MODIFIED STEERING ASSEMBLIES BASELINE SLED TESTS - In preparation for the accelerator sled tests, the Chevrolet Citation and Ford Granada vehicles were both stripped, cut in half, and reinforced around their peripheries. These body bucks were then painted inside and outside to enhance the viewing of the dummies and steering assemblies by the high-speed movie cameras. The sled acceleration-time pulse employed for the Citation tests approximated the vehicle crash pulse at the required velocities of 20, 25, and 30 mph (32, 40, and 48 km/h). The pulse contained a peak acceleration of approximately 19.8 głs and a duration of 0.117 seconds for the 30 mph case. In the same manner for the Granada vehicle, the sled pulses were set up to match the vehicle crash pulses. All hardware and parts in the Citation and Granada bucks were standard production units, such as windshields, steering systems, and dash panels. Figure 15 shows the dummy and steering assembly measurements that were recorded for each test. Dummy abdominal deflections were derived from measured peak pressure data recorded from an abdominal pressure sac in the Hybrid in dummy (11). The results from six baseline sled tests are presented in Table 2 for the three test velocities; three runs were performed in the Citation buck and three in the Granada. Dummy sternal deflections (as measured internally in the chest cavity) are related to total chest deflections by adding 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) to the sternal measurements (12). An inspection of the Citation test results indicated that dummy sternal deflections increased with impact velocities, showing peaks of 0.9, 1.5, and 2.5 inches (2.3, 3.8, and 6.4 cm) for speeds of 20, 25, and 30 mph (32, 40, and 48 km/h), respectively. Chest accelerations were below 60 głs. Abdominal displacements were somewhat inconsistent over the velocity range of these tests, showing a maximum of 4.2 inches (10.7 cm) in the 30 mph (48 km/h) test. The EA (energy absorbing) column data showed that in the two highest velocity runs, the columns had exhibited full strokes and had bottomed out at 4.1 inches (10.4 cm). 701</page><page sequence="12">In comparison with the Citation test results, the Granada data indicated dummy sternal deflections that were somewhat lower in comparable tests, but chest accelerations were significantly higher showing 96 gTs compared to 52 gTs at 30 mph (48 km/h). /head' NOTES: i m ' - •• Ay I /] I ALL DIRECTIONS SHOWN ARE POSITIVE (+) X ļ A 3 A = acceleration * ' A i D = DISPLACEMENT Ay ' rvT - F = FORCE NECKf/i ^ Fx P = PRESSURE / Fz 1 'STERNUM i CHEST V ^ Ax Upper 'A D_' Ax LOWER Ay yAz ?

Twelve tests were performed with the basic steering system changes and another nine runs investigated combinations of system parameters. A summary of the results of the modified steering assembly tests is presented in Table 3. Examination of results from the first twelve tests, where a single parameter was varied in each test, indicated no outstanding reduction in driver injury levels. In addition, when comparing these performance results with comparable baseline test data, they showed minimal changes in dummy performance, that is, several results were better than baseline data and some were poorer. The only exception was the test of the column stiffness parameter in Test No. 4728, which employed a modified 1200 lbs. (5.34 kN) constant force EA steering column. When these data are compared to baseline results, they showed that the chest acceleration was reduced by 27% (38.1 gTs versus 52.0 gTs), the sternal deflection reduced by 8% (2.3 inches (5.8 cm) versus 2.5 inches (6.4 cm)), and the abdominal deflection was marginally reduced by 2% (4.1 inch (10.4 cm) versus 4.2 inches (10.7 cm)). The relatively long stroke distance of the modified column of 5.8 inches (14.7 cm) was probably the major cause of these reductions in dummy injury measurements. An analysis of the results of the next eight tests employing the combinations of system variables, shown in Table 3, indicated that none of the designs produced outstanding performance when compared to the baseline system. The only design that performed somewhat better was the deep-dish stiff rim wheel in combination with the 29° steering column. However, this steering column bottomed Table 2 SUMMARY OF BASELINE SLED TEST DATA Hybrid III Dummy NOMINAL SLED STERNAL CHEST ABDOMINAL COLUMN COLUMN TEST NO. VELOCITY HIC DEFLECTION* ACCEL.

The second combination of steering system variables investigated was the series employing steering column mass and column stiffness properties. Out of the four tests scheduled for this series, one test was performed at this point- a heavy steering column in combination with a 1200 lb. (5.34 kN) constant force stroking mechan- ism (Test No. 4859), shown at the bottom of Table 3. These results indicated a small increase in performance over the baseline test data in that the dummy sternal deflection was approximately the same, the chest acceleration was decreased 13%, and the abdominal deflection was less by 24%. This performance improvement was due mainly to the 1200 lb. (5.34 kN) constant force stroking mechanism of the column. The second test to be performed in this combination series, a light column with a 1200 lb. constant force mechanism, had already been tested in a previous series, Test No. 4728. The two remaining tests with rigid steering columns were not performed. SLED TESTS OF BENEFIT 1 and BENEFIT 2 SYSTEMS - The Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 steering systems were tested in both the Citation and Granada sled bucks. The performance results are presented in Table 4 for nominal impact speeds of 25 mph (40 km/h) and 30 mph (48 km/h). The Benefit 1 test results (Citation, 30 mph) indicated a dummy maximum sternal deflection 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) and a chest acceleration of 44.2 gTs. Similarly, the Benefit 2 system, using a Granada EA column and a Benefit 1 wheel, recorded 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) and 44.1 gTs for sternal deflection and chest acceleration, respectively. The maximum abdominal penetration recorded in the Citation test series was 3.0 inches (7.6 cm) in Test No. 4727. The Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 test results in the Granada buck indicated very good performance considering the dummy was totally unrestrained. For example, the Benefit 1 system in the Granada at 30 mph indicated 39.1 g!s in chest acceleration compared to the established injury level of 60 głs. Also the sternal deflection was low at 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) and the abdominal deflection was average at 2.3 inches (5.8 cm). When the Benefit 1 and Benefit 2 test results are matched with comparable baseline data, it is apparent that these steering systems performed exceptionally well (Figure 16). Comparing Benefit 1 Test No. 4727 (Citation, 30 mph) with baseline data showed chest accelerations of 44.2 gTs versus 52.0 gTs or a decrease of 15%. Dummy sternal deflections were reduced from 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) Table 3 SUMMARY OF SLED TEST DATA FOR VARIATIONS IN STEERING SYSTEM PROPERTIES CITATION BODY BUCK, VELOCITY = 30 MPH TEST STERNAL CHEST ABDOMINAL COLUMN COLUMN PROPERTIES NO HIC DEFLECTION* ACCEL.

' i ! i * Dummy chest deflection = sternal deflection + 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) for the baseline run to 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) - a decrease of 68%. Abdominal deflections went from 4.2 inches (10.7 cm) to 3.0 inches (7.6 cm) or a reduction of 29%. Finally, peak femur loads of the Benefit 1 test were roughly comparable to the baseline results in a range of 1300 (5.78) to 1600 lbs (7.12 kN). CONCLUSIONS • The Benefit 1 steering assembly with improved safety features based on designs developed from computer modelling significantly reduced thora- cic injury measures on the Hybrid III dummy in sled tests. Injury reductions, over baseline Citation and Granada, were 50% and more for chest deflection, from about 15% to 60% for chest acceleration in all but two tests, and from 10% to 40% for abdominal deflection. The two chest acceleration readings, which increased slightly over baseline, were acceptably low in the mid-30s range. • The Benefit 2 steering assembly, which was constructed from production and near production components, provided injury reduction levels similar, and in some cases superior, to the more research oriented Benefit 1 steering assembly. • The modified Citation steering system components consisting of variations of 1, 2, or 3 parameters produced performance levels that were less desirable than a system composed of a complete set of tuned parameters, such as the Benefit systems.
