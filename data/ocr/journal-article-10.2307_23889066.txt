<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Role of Science in Behavioral Disorders James M. Kauffman University of Virginia ABSTRACT: A scientific, rule-governed approach to solving problems suggests assumptions that (a) we need different rules for different purposes, (b) all rules are grounded In values, (ç) the origins and appropriate application of particular rules are often misunderstood, (d) personal experience and the popularity of ideas are often unreliable, and (e) all truths are tentative. Each assumption is related to behavioral disorders, and a rule-governed approach to problems of living is contrasted to the approach of mules. I Special education as a concept and as a field of study is often misunderstood and mis represented by those who propose radical re form or restructuring (Hockenbury, Kauffman, &amp; Hallahan, in press). Special education for students with emotional or behavioral disor ders is at particularly high risk of being misun derstood and poorly implemented, in part because many individuals today neglect or undermine its scientific foundations (Walker et al., 1998). Hence, we need to address directly the crucial role of science in providing more effective education for the students we serve. I am a special educator, not a philosopher, and I was not trained in the natural sciences. Therefore, I write as a layperson about ab stract philosophical and scientific issues, but also as a professional educator concerned about the implications of these issues for spe cial education. Science, in this article, refers to the methodologies of testing disconfirmable hypotheses and proofs through publicly verifi able data to which scientists and philosophers of science such as Diamond (1997), Gould (1997), Gross (1998), Kuhn (1996), and Wil son (I998) refer. The importance of the topic is underscored by the burgeoning antiscience sentiment among the public and among spe cial educators, which has been discussed elsewhere (e.g., Kauffman, 1999a, 1999b; Walker, in press; Walker et al., 1998). Rules and Mules: Contrasting Worlds of Rule-Making The basic issue at hand is how we will choose to live in a rule-governed world. That is, what rules should we choose to govern our behav ior, particularly our professional behavior? Humans make rules for living, and these rules may be constructed or reconstructed to form various belief systems and to govern personal behavior and interpersonal interaction. Such rules may lead people to cling stubbornly to a belief or pattern of behavior simply because a religious authority figure told them to or be cause it fits their preferences or construction of reality, regardless of evidence to the con trary. Prejudice, blind loyalty, and corrupted logic are neither exclusive to religion nor ex cluded from the lives of those who claim to work outside the realm of religious faith. Ei ther religious or secular rules may demand or justify the killing of other human beings who disagree with a rule, which is perhaps the ulti mate in the rule-corrupted conduct that we call "mulish." During my reflection on the topic of this article, a verse by Ogden Nash that accompa nies Camille Saint-Saens's Carnival of the Ani mals came to mind: "In the world of mules, there are no rules." An anthropomorphic view might lead us to conclude that language means nothing other than what the mule con structs from it; reality is determined by how the mule sees things, not by anything external to the mule. A mule lives blissfully ad hoc—is idiosyncratically deconstructive, coercive, un predictable, and oppositional. Nash's verse suggests an alternative to the world of mules—a different, rule-governed world that, presumably, humans may choose or decline to inhabit at particular times. Behavioral Disorders, 24(4), 265-272 August 1999 / 265</page><page sequence="2">Five Assumptions Regarding Rules Actually, in the world of mules, there is one rule: "The world is as I see (or construct or in vent) it or believe it to be." Humans might best choose an alternative rule-governed world in which they assume that (a) we need different rules for different purposes, since no single set of rules is a fully satisfactory guide to all aspects of living; (b) all rules are grounded in values, and we must specify the values of our rules; (c) the origins and appro priate application of particular rules are often misunderstood; (d) personal experience and the popularity of ideas are often unreliable guides to rule making; and (e) all truths are tentative, but some truths are more tentative than others, and science provides a set of rules for revising what is accepted as truth. Each of these points applies to the value of science in behavioral disorders. Each also has a counterpoint that humans adopt when they enter the world of mules. Different Rules Serve Different Purposes Science has particular purposes, and these purposes are not exhaustive. Some purposes are best served by a scientific approach (e.g., finding and altering the causes of a particular category of an individual's behavior), but other purposes are not answerable directly by the rules of science (e.g., answering the ques tion "Should we change this behavior?"). Nev ertheless, scientific evidence may play a role in our thinking about nonscientific as well as scientific matters. Anyone who tries to approach behavioral disorders strictly within the framework of only one set of rules (e.g., science or a particular religion) is certain to get into very troubled waters quickly. Both science and all alterna tive sets of rules for constructing reality have limitations in explaining behavioral disorders and remedies. Science is our best first ap proach to problems, as it is a peerless tool for establishing common knowledge, but there are aspects of living for which it provides very weak answers or no answers at all. Science may tell us unequivocally what is, but it does not tell is what is morally right or best. In the world of mules, however, there is no need to match rules to problems. There are no rules other than the one that may fit the mule's fancy at the moment. Post hoc, the mule may bray "I did it my way" without fear of contradiction. Rules Are Grounded in Values We cannot approach the problem of behav ioral disorders without values, regardless of whether our orientation is scientific or some alternative. Science, like religion and other al ternatives, can be used in devastating ways. Science, like alternative sets of rules, is merely a tool, and it is the worker using it, not the tool itself, that bears blame for misfortune. Science is the most admirable tool we have for solving many or most of the problems we encounter in behavioral disorders, but it is not corruption proof, nor is any alternative. Un like guns and other weapons of destruction, science is not a tool to which we might best limit access, but a tool in the use of which we might best provide better training and in creased access. Special education teachers and scholars are best armed against igno rance, failure, fraud, and abuse with greater knowledge of scientific practices. As special educators, we must be explicit in stating the values we hold and act responsi bly in choosing the rules that lead us most di rectly and reliably to outcomes that honor those values. In fact, one of the values we should hold as special educators is that we must not waste our time and effort or the lives of those we serve by acting in ways that in crease the cost of or delay or deny the benefits of effective instruction or the benefits of learn ing prosocial conduct. Unwillingness to embrace values other than satisfying our own preferences, or refus ing to clarify our values, reduces us to the world of mules—a world made to personal order. All that matters is the mule's own con struction of reality, a deeply held but unchecked value. Mules embrace one value: immediate self-interest. They are shamelessly egocentric. 266 / August 1999 Behavioral Disorders, 24(A), 265-272</page><page sequence="3">Origins of and Application of Rules Are Often Misunderstood The origins, progress, and proper applications of science are poorly understood by many— especially by the general public and some times by scientists (cf. Gross, 1998; Kuhn, 1996; Wilson, 1998). Likewise, many people may misapprehend the origins and historical purposes of certain religious teachings and rules (cf. Pagels, 1995; Saramago, 1994). As a consequence, the sciences and many religions are often practiced poorly or with undesirable or even disastrous results. Indeed, the relationship or coexistence of scientific understanding and religious belief is sometimes an odd juxtaposition. To some, it is anathema to apply the rules of science to the study of history. Witness the oxymoron "cre ation science" used by those who reject scien tific evidence in favor of religious faith while ostensibly reconciling the two. ("Creation" here refers to the assumption that scientific ev idence of geological and biological evolution is false and that the earth and human beings were made thousands of years ago to be much as they are today.) Yet applying the sci entific method to the study of history is the most reliable process we have of discovering the origins of and reasons for rules and the causes of particular phenomena (Diamond, 1997, 1999). Questions in many fields of study, including many questions in education, cannot be answered by controlled scientific experiments, but that does not mean that sci ence is irrelevant or marginal in finding the most reliable answers. Thus the difficulties historians face in establishing cause-and-effect relations in the history of human societies are broadly similar to the difficulties facing astronomers, climatologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, ge ologists, and paleontologists. To vary ing degrees, each of these fields is plagued by the impossibility of per forming replicated, controlled experi mental interventions, the complexity arising from enormous variables, the resulting uniqueness of each system, the consequent impossibility of formu lating universal laws, and the difficul ties of predicting emergent properties and future behavior. (Diamond, 1997, p. 424) As Diamond (1997, 1999) explained, these observations do not demote the role of science in understanding historical events and their causes but call for greater understanding of how scientific evidence is used when direct replication is not possible or when events are very complex or unique. Certainly, as Ellis (1999) argued, science cannot answer all of the questions we might pose about history (or, I might add, about anything else). Neverthe less, a choice not to use science as a tool for finding out what we can about historical events (or behavior) or not to use scientific ev idence in weighing hypotheses about history (or interpersonal relationships) is a mulish dereliction of intelligence. In special education, controlled experi ments are possible for finding answers to some questions; for others, methods more like those that Diamond (1997) described for his tory and other nonexperimental sciences must be used. Diamond also noted the value of predicting large-scale effects that are a conse quence of small-scale events averaged out. This is a mathematical and scientific principle of enormous consequence for understanding such phenomena as the role of reinforcement (both positive and negative, and for specific forms of conduct) and punishment in school wide discipline and the acting-out behavior of children and youths in schools, homes, and communities. The source of rules is sometimes held to be more important than the rationality or util ity of rules themselves. In fact, this is the crux of certain religions and all forms of totalitari anism. Truth is assumed to be revealed by the personal authority of a deity or saint or cult or political leader, whose word may be difficult to understand but, nevertheless, must be left unchallenged. The Bible, the Koran, Chair man Mao, Reverend Jim Jones, the party line—these are examples of the writings, indi viduals, or organizations that are taken as the final authority or source of truth for those who govern by religious or totalitarian rules. Of course, when one accepts truth derived from authority, then contradictions of that authority are judged to be in error. Moreover, truth and falsity are sometimes judged on the basis of the genetic ancestry of those who make rules, Behavioral Disorders, 24(4), 265-272 August 1999 / 267</page><page sequence="4">as in the case of religious or secular dynasties or gender-based or race-based judgments. Science is sometimes said to be merely another party line, a way of thinking no less confining than religion and one highly suspect because it represents the cultural and gender biases of white males of European genetic her itage. First, science is a way of thinking that does have rules, but these are self-correcting rules that leave open the possibility of the re vision of knowledge, as I note later. Second, rejection of science because of the genetic heritage of its proponents represents sexism or racism or tribalism at its worst. Science can not be arrogated to a gender or race or tribe except by the authoritarian or totalitarian de mands of individuals who abuse it. It behooves special educators to reject rules that give priority to the genetic heritage of those who make rules and to embrace rule making that places highest value on veracity obtained without reference to the genetic her itage of the investigator. Particularly in the field of emotional and behavioral disorders, we should embrace the rules of science that, as Gross (1998) has pointed out, have ex posed sexism, racism, and other assumptions of the genetic superiority of monarchs, na tions, or tribes as lies. Again, it is possible for individuals to make false claims of scientific evidence for the superiority of a race or gen der, but such misapplications of science are corrected not by abandonment of scientific in quiry but by better science (see Gross, 1998). In the world of mules, valid rules originate with mules. Other rules are judged to be dis criminatory by nature of origin and assumed not to fit mules. Humans in the world of mules similarly reject rules not originating in their clan (e.g., gender, ethnic group, religion). Personal Experience and Popularity Are Often Unreliable What an individual believes to be true and what is true may be different, a concept held in all or nearly all cultures and a principle so fundamental to judgments of fairness that it need not be belabored (e.g., see King, 1999, for comments on the evil consequences of ar bitrary construction of the meaning of "nig gardly"). For good reason, scientists are skeptical of personal experience that can not be replicated or that is at variance with the objective historical record; it is usually found to be untrustworthy. Thus, in special educa tion we are wise to find out what is through the method of science, which requires the dis confirmation of rival hypotheses in explaining phenomena. Personal testimony to the value of educa tional methods without scientific scrutiny and confirmation has led many into harm's way, or at least into ineffective efforts. Moreover, science provides a vehicle for communicating reliable findings to others, saving most the burden of personal discovery of principles and practices that only the greatest sages of a generation may uncover. Were every individ ual required to recreate the cognitive and me chanical experiments of the most brilliant individuals, written language (perhaps oral language as well), science, and organized so cieties would not exist. It is only through ob servation, imitation, and especially written language and scientific method that the ad vantages of contemporary life have been at tained. As Carnine (1998) noted, special education will become a mature profession only when it rejects idiosyncratic knowledge for a common knowledge based on what can be verified objectively through methods of sci entific inquiry. Popular beliefs often have been disproved by science. The list of such misinformation is long, and every reader will know at least a few commonly held views that have been de bunked by scientific investigation and now seem oddly at variance with reality. How is veracity best tested, history most reliably cor rected, or reality most consistently and benefi cially constructed? One response is that a cultural consensus is the critical discriminator of truth, history, and reality. Another is that an actual world exists independent of individual or group perceptions, significant parts of which can be apprehended by scientific in vestigation. Gould (1997) said about the way things are versus the way they may be per ceived in a given culture: Some things in nature just are—even though we can parse and interpret such real items in wildly various ways. A lion is a lion is a lion—and lions are more closely tied by genealogy to tigers than to earthworms. (Of course, I recognize that some system of human thought might base its central 268 / August 1999 Behavioral Disorders, 24(4), 265-272</page><page sequence="5">principle upon a spiritual or metaphorical tie between lion and earthworm—but nature's genealogies would not be changed thereby, even though the evolutionary tree of life might be utterly ignored or actively denied.) (p. 17) As special educators, we should most value finding out what just is, the truths that transcend cultural boundaries. Some may complain that the scientific community itself is a culture and that it should not be held above others, that science is no better than other ways of thinking and, therefore, should not be given "privilege" in drawing conclu sions. The proof is in the pudding, and in this case the pudding is the consequences for cul tures. The debate of this issue is complex, consuming many volumes and going far be yond the possibility of adequate treatment in this article. However, some things, regardless of cultural bias, just are, as Gould (1997) sug gested. Moreover, about some things we can say with considerable confidence, "that is the way the real world works" (Wilson, 1998, p. 47). For example, a culture may have no writ ten language and rely on oral tradition to dis seminate information and to pass knowledge from one generation to the next. Diamond (1997) concluded that a culture with written language has overwhelming advantages over a culture depending on the oral tradition, ex plaining in part why some cultures have come to dominate others. I wager that the culture with the greatest chance of surviving and maintaining the greatest degree of human dig nity and freedom is the one in which scientific evidence is held to be the common knowl edge. The implication for special educators is that science is an invaluable tool for achiev ing understanding of emotional and behav ioral disorders and for devising effective and humane treatment of these disorders. We will reject personal experience and popular no tions that conflict with scientific evidence if we have regard for bettering the quality of stu dents' lives and advising our successors about how best to teach. In the world of mules, personal experi ence is all that counts. Mules use personal participation as the sole basis for constructing their rules and drawing their conclusions. They scorn the very idea of objectivity; the ac tual world is what a mule construes it to be. All Truth Is Tentative In the sciences, what is assumed to be true often is revised or radically overturned by new evidence or better solutions to old problems (Kuhn, 1996). Some revolutions of thought have overturned older, commonly held ideas but, in turn, seem unlikely ever to be replaced by new evidence. For example, in the 16th century, Copernicus overturned the idea that the sun orbits the earth and provided evi dence that it is the other way around—the earth orbits the sun. However, it seems ex tremely unlikely that the "new" truth that the earth orbits the sun will ever be overturned by evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, sci ence is an open, self-correcting way of think ing, and it allows evidence that the earth does not orbit the sun (or that the earth is flat—in deed, any hypothesis, regardless of how silly it may seem) to be tested again. A common misunderstanding is that sci ence is a process of arriving at certainties. However, science is really a matter of estimat ing probabilities. As previously noted, scien tific work has lowered the probability that some hypotheses are true to an extremely low level, very close to zero (e.g., that the sun or bits the earth, the earth is flat, insects are spontaneously generated by rotting meat, hu mans exist in miniature form in eggs or in sperm). The real work of science is at the mar gins of knowledge where ambiguity is great. Ambiguity sustains scientists, whose system atic investigations reduce ambiguities by bringing order to seeming disorder. But ambi guity is poison to politicians, whose work is assertion and persuasion, and, if necessary, the creation of disorder and imposition of a new order by fiat, not by systematic empirical inquiry (see Wilson, 1998). In the end, science demands that some one's assertion, personal belief, cultural bias, or authoritative statement must yield to replic able evidence. Old scientific evidence must yield to newer if and only if the newer evi dence is verified independently and provides a fuller explanation of phenomena or a better solution to problems than the older data (Kuhn, 1996). Furthermore, scientific truths are understood by scientists to be conditional; certain truths may apply only under certain Behavioral Disorders, 24(4), 265-272 August 1999 / 269</page><page sequence="6">conditions, having little or no application to everyday living or to hypothetical circum stances or to phenomena not typically per ceived. For example, "old" (Newtonian) physics may apply to everyday problems, even very complex problems, regardless of the "new" (quantum) physics. The new physics may have virtually no implications at all for building homes and cars, exercising, and solv ing the vast majority of problems of dealing with the physical world as we perceive it without highly sophisticated instruments. Speculations have been made about the im plications of discoveries in atomic physics for interpersonal relationships, but these reflect a profound misunderstanding of both science (specifically, of physics) and interpersonal re lationships. Perhaps a more frequent and fundamental misunderstanding, however, is the notion that science is not corrective because it is corrupt ible, because its supposed "truths" have sometimes been proved wrong or used for evil purposes. Gross (1998) and Toison (1998) ar gued that these observations do not diminish the value of science in moving us toward more reliable common knowledge that can better serve the cause of social justice. How did they [liberal politicians since the 18th century] accomplish that [re alize the goals of greater social jus tice]? Why, by identifying true (or nearly true) universals, such as the common origins, physiologies, aspira tions, and feelings of all humankind, and refuting the false ones, such as the divine right of kings, natural slavery, and the general inferiority of women. Yes, by some scientists, and at various times, science has offered false univer sals, but those have been overthrown only by better science. And without reaching for true, or better-approach ing-true commonalities, we would have only the idiosyncrasies of tribes, including those of whatever tribe you or I happen to belong to. (Gross, 1998, p. 48) The history of humankind is not, as sev eral eminent scientists have noted, a record of progress without regression. Diamond (1997, 1999) noted that there have been periods of regression in the history of human societies, or the devolution of technologies and their ad vantages, due to choices of powerful individ ual leaders or factions or cultural biases. For example, the abandonment of ocean-going fleets of ships by the Chinese in the mid 15th century, a decision of a powerful political fac tion, yielded advantage to European explor ers, whose sailing technologies then allowed them to dominate the world. China's so-called Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, a movement in which political power was used to suppress science and other intellectual pursuits, is now widely recognized to have plunged China into an anti-intellectual morass from which it will take many decades to recover. "It was only a few mad Chinese leaders who destroyed the educational system of China's 1 billion people during the Great Cultural Revolution of the 1960s" (Diamond, 1999, p. B3). Any people may create its own dark age by allowing a few powerful individuals or a revolutionary fac tion mulishly to disavow common (scientific) knowledge and dictate what is true and what is not. The implication is that what we assume to be true about emotional and behavioral disor ders is tentative. But our best option is to look to present scientific understanding for best practices and to scientific study for the revi sion of most of our truths. We are not called upon to know absolutely, but to put our most reliable knowledge to work in the interests of children and to continue to test our ideas by the methods that provide greatest benefit— which is to say, I believe, that the best inter ests of children are served when we use science skillfully as our first approach to solv ing problems in our field. Mules define truth ad hoc—for a particu lar purpose and without concern for wider ap plication. This means that truth may indeed be tentative, but that it is defined to fit the mule's immediate need, not to fit the wider context of an external world. Conclusion The reaction of most of the children and youths we serve in special education, and their families, to philosophical and theoretical issues is likely to be "So what?" Those we serve may implicitly be demanding, in com mon parlance, "Show me the money!" This is entirely understandable, as many of our philo sophical and theoretical debates go nowhere 270 / August 1999 Behavioral Disorders, 24(4), 265-272</page><page sequence="7">and solve nothing. Our philosophical discus sions and theorizing typically do not ad dress—at least not pragmatically—the problems society wants solved (Walker et al., 1998). Those we serve want us to demonstrate that our work produces reliable benefits. Our best response is to show them the science supporting our recommendations, not merely our philosophical or personal predilections. True, showing scientific evidence reveals a predilection, but it is a preference for reliable, publicly verifiable data, for common knowl edge. This is what we are asked for most often by parents and policymakers, either directly or by inference. Perhaps philosophical or theoretical con flict is inevitable in an open society, since people in such societies are free to hold and advance any views they wish. This does not mean that all ideas are of equal merit or that all should be viewed as acceptable or equally useful choices. In fact, it is the failure to con front ideas that allows evil to triumph, as illus trated most vividly in the 20th century by the rise of Stalinism, Nazism, Maoism, and other forms of totalitarianism, including racism and regimes based on religious laws that demean and subjugate women and minorities. As spe cial educators, we should be particularly keen to point out the predictable consequences for individuals and societies of choices in rule making and to warn against the disavowal of common knowledge. The competition of ideas is, for the most part, a sign of societal well-being, and in the long run it is the most useful or pragmatic ideas that typically win, although in the short term they can be suppressed. Nevertheless, in dividuals and societies can make bad choices among ideas—choices that seem to some in nocuous but that ultimately put them at a dis tinct disadvantage among other human beings. Societies may be disadvantaged by ge ography (Diamond, 1997), and individuals may be disadvantaged by life circumstances within a given society (Katz, 1997). The disad vantages of geography and personal circum stances may be played well or be compounded by poor choices. Our responsi bilities as special educators include helping people overcome obstacles of personal cir cumstance. The question is "How do we best do that?" The children, youths, families, and soci eties we serve are confronted by many diffi cult problems, and we are derelict in our duty as special educators if we do not declare the rules by which we will pursue and evaluate solutions to these problems. Those who pro pose alternatives to science must be held to account—required to demonstrate how their conceptualizations offer superior problem solving in our field. Unfortunately, scientific conceptualization is sometimes rejected in favor of an assertion without evaluation of its problem-solving merits. Some special educa tors appear to reject one view, perhaps the tra ditional or dominant one, without demonstrating that another is a better way of solving a problem. They seem to say, in effect, "I think your idea is flawed, and it is not my responsibility to show you how mine is better; I just don't like yours, and I like mine." The world of mules allows this. In the world of sci ence, however, a challenger to what is tenta tively believed must state how an alternative conceptualization or method is superior— and, ultimately, must bring forward reliable data to show that it is or abandon the claim (Kuhn, 1996). Special educators should make best use of and continue to add to the already consider able scientific basis for our work and look to science whenever possible for better solutions to problems. Ideally, those we serve will say of us that we are not mules, that we know the rules of science and work within them. We should neither be coy about stating the rules by which we do our work nor reject the sci ence we have inherited without strong evi dence that an alternative conceptualization or methodology is more helpful in achieving the values we say we hold.
