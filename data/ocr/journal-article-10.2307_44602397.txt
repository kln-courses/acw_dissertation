<plain_text><page sequence="1">LLAGOSTERA CUENCA, E., Estudio radiologico de las momias egipcias del Museo arqueológico nacional de Mad- rid / Radiological Examination of the Egyptian Mummies of the Archaeologi- cal Museum of Madrid, Madrid 1978, 107 pp., plenty fies . The prominent Spanish X-ray specia- list and Kodak representative undertook a radiographic examination of 5 human mummies and 10 small mummified ob- jects (called packets), published in a well printed volume with excellent colour photographs and perfect radiographs pre- sented in a well legible large reproduc- tions. The human mummies were labelled Madrid I- V. Mummy M. I belonged to a 25-year-old anonymous woman; ac- cording to visceral parcels the authors dated the mummy 23rd - 26th Dynasties, not taking into account that divided po- lychromie cartonages, which are lying on the mummy, are more often dated starting the latest dynasties. Mummy M. II with the same kind of cartonages was found empty; the author favors a rela- tively modern falsification. This should be the mummy of priest Nesmin; I won- der if his mummy could have been re- moved out of the wrappings; to prove it, radiocarbon test on wrappings and technological examination of the tex- tiles would be of help. Mummy M. Ill was lying in a coffin dated New King- dòm till 21st Dynasty belonging to a i certain Bak. The radiologic examination revealed, however, that it is a female who 1 died at age 60-65 years, ill with arte- riosclerosis, teeth ailments, and arthritis, and it is believed by the author to date [ Ptolemaic period (crossed arms on the [ breast). Mummy M. IV is covered with ' divided guilded cartonages dated Ptole- maic period bearing the name of Nespa- medu. It was found to belong to a 55- year-old male afflicted with arterioscle- rosis. By the X-rays an interesting ton- gue plate and a small anthropomorphic figurine (Imsety?) was revealed. In spite » of the fact, that 4 visceral parcels and subcutaneous filling have been found, the . aüthor retained the dating of the carto- ņage allowing for survival of earlier pe- riods embalging techniques. Such cases } were reported in the British Museum L mummies by Dawson and Gray (1968) as well as in mummies from Czechoslo- val collections by Strouhal and Vyhná- nek (1976). The almost decomposed mummy M. V with a 25th Dynasty an- thropoid coffin should belong to Tareme- tenbastet. The sex could not been de- termined, but I would guess according to the skull rather for a male. It was dated by the author "between the end of the 23rd Dynasty and the 26th Dynasty" without pointing out the reasons for this conclusion. Two of the 10 packets were found completely empty suggesting a fake (B, G), in some others only a portion of the contents was present - two long bones of a bird (A), group of bird bones without a distinguishable head (C), and a crocodile without extremities, clavicles, omoplates and pelvis (I). One packet with an undeterminable animal was arti- ficially prolonged (D). Another packet showed a "formulées labyrinth of bones of a bird" with a head of a small cro- codile (F). Only the remaining 3 packets were complete animal mummies with decently wrapped bodies - of a cat (E), an ibis (H) and a falcon (Falco pereg- rinus L.) (.1). The study is complemented by a chap- ter on the origin of the Egyptian mum- mies in the National Archaeological Mu- seum, by a survey on mummification in Egypt, and by technical notes, suggest- ing interesting new methods for the X- ray examination of mummies. The big advantage of the book is its bilingual Spanish-English text which will surely enlarge the circle of interested readers. Only some prining errors dis- turb the reading of the English version. In spite of the somewhat disappointing fact, that one of the five mummies and the majority of the packets proved to be fakes and one mummy badly dis- turbed, the author did an excellent pro- fessional job and one has to felicitate him to such a nice volume.
