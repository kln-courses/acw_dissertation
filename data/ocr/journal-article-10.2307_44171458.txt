<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism* An Attempt at Understanding Early Medieval Shinto 1 Iyanaga Nobumi iSížKísli Le présent article propose une nouvelle manière de concevoir ce que l'on appelle le « shinto médiéval » ou, plutôt , certains courants de la pensée « bouddho-shintoïste » de la première moitié du Moyen Age, comme « une forme japonaise de l' "hindouisme" ». En partant d'un passage du Yamato Katsuragi hözanki (milieu du xnf siècle ?), qui reproduit un mythe cosmogonique hindou à travers un texte du Dazhidu-lun M, on essayera de remonter à Annen (841-889 ou 898) et à Seison M (1012-1074) pour retrouver les inspirations premières sur lesquelles ces courants semblent s'être formés. La pensée mystique immanentiste d'Annen, qui sera l'un des plus importants précurseurs de la « Pensée de l'Eveil Ońginel » (hongaku shisõ du Moyen Age, et surtout ses spéculations sur les soumissions des divinités hindoues par les Vénérés bouddhiques, auront pu servir de base pour le développement d'une certaine tendance théiste dans la pensée du « bouddho-shintoïsme ». D'autre part, Seison, qui s'est appuyé lui-même sur une exégèse mythologique d'Annen, a écrit vers la fin d'un ouvrage intitulé Shingon fiihõ sanyõshõ (1060) quelques lignes qui auront une influence décisive sur la pensée shintoïste naissante à la fin du xif siècle et au xiif siècle : il y identifie virtuellement le Japon au « pays d'origine du Buddha Mahãvairocana ». C'est de là que sont parties bien des théories universalistes plaçant le Japon à une position primordiale dans le monde. Les différentes versions du mythe du roi Māra du Sixième Ciel semblent également liées à ces lignes de Seison. Dans la seconde partie de l'article, on tentera de jeter une nouvelle lumière sur les résultats de cet examen de différents discours de la première moitié du Moyen Age, en considérant l'ouvrage du savant « nativiste » de l'époque Edo, HirataAtsutane¥-'BMM&gt; (1776-1843), intitulé Indo zõshi Hirata, qui développe des critiques virulentes contre le bouddhisme, essaie de retrouver des fragments de mythes originels hindous dans les Ecritures bouddhiques, et déclare qu'ils sont en réalité des traces de la mythologie japonaise, qui est la vérité universelle. Dans ses analyses de textes bouddhiques, il avance que le contenu des ouvrages ésotériques représente la pensée hindoue à peine déguisée sous une apparence bouddhique. Et la théologie qui résulte de ses enquêtes est étonnamment proche de la théologie des courants médiévaux qui ont été examinés dans la première partie. Ainsi, malgré l'étrange impression que peut produire la notion de «forme japonaise de l' " hindouisme " » à première vue, il semble que cette manière de concevoir la pensée shintoïste naissante à l'époque médiévale puisse avoir une certaine valeur heuristique pour comprendre ses caractères fondamentaux. 1.

The suggestion that Shintõ is a form of "Japanese Hinduism" may appear odd at first, but it is precisely this sentiment of "oddity" that I would like to stress, in order to use it as a "heuristic guide" to assist us in articulating a new perspective on the ideological background against which Shintõ thought developed. To begin with, I would like to call attention to a passage that struck me when I first read it. It is the beginning of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki ÀfPlPÍSLilfE, a Shinto text that can roughly be situated in the mid- or late thirteenth century.4 Thus we heard: When Heaven and Earth were about to be realized, the pneuma of water changed into Heaven and Earth. The winds of the ten directions came each against other, touching each other and were able to bear (ji-su W) the great water. On the water, a sacred being (jinshõ/kami #Ü) was born through transformation. It had a thousand heads and two thousand hands and feet: its name was Ikõ, the Permanently Compassionate Divine King (Jojū jihijinnõ to nazuke Ikõ to nasu From the navel of this human god ( nin-jin ÀW) blossomed a lotus flower of a thousand marvelous treasure petals of gold; the lotus emitted a great light, similar to ten thousand suns shining all together. It is from this flower that [another] human god was born: he sat in the lotus position and shone with unlimited light also; his name was the Deva-king Brahmā (Bon-tennõ 2. The term "Hinduism" has been object of critical discussion by some scholars, as a "con- structed concept," resulting from the dialectical encounter between India and Europe (see Richard King, Orientalism and Religion : Postcolonial Theory, India and ' the Mystic East', London and New York, Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 1999, pp. 98-1 11; Gregory Price Grieve, "Staking Out the Field: A Henotheistic Review of Supplemental Readers for the Study of Hinduism," Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 76, No. 3 (2008), pp. 716-747; Brian Kemble Pennington, Was Hinduism invented ?: Britons, Indians, and Colonial Construction of Religion, Oxford University Press 2005. - I owe these references to Charles D. Orzech. We can argue that the category "Shinto" is also a constructed concept (see Mark Teeuwen, "From Jindõ to Shintõ: A Concept Takes Shape," Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, 29/3-4, 2002, pp. 233-263). See also my remark in the conclusion on the "neo-paganism" (below, p. 299). 3.

I use the text edited by Itõ Satoshi {FUIS in Ise Shintöshü (coll.

If the arguments presented by Abe Yasurõ in his article in this volume can be confirmed, we should think that many of them, including the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki, were created much earlier than commonly believed.</page><page sequence="3">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 265 ī). He gave birth to eight children, who in turn gave birth to all the people in Heaven and on Earth ( tenchi ninmin He was named Heavenly God, and also called the Heavenly Emperor Ancestor-God ( tentei no so-jin ^rfrÂiâfà). This text is almost a literal quotation from the Dazhidulun We can presume from this quotation that the author of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki was familiar with the Dazhidu-lun. More striking still is the fact that this account of creation is a famous Hindu myth which explains that the cosmos originated from the navel of Visņu-Nārāyaņa who was lying at the bottom of the ocean, sleeping on Sesa, the cosmic serpent.6 This myth is quoted in several Buddhist texts as an example 5. Dazhidulun , T. XXV 1509: 116a5-ll (see E. Lamotte, Le Traité de la grande vertu de sagesse de Nāgārjuna (Mahāprajnāpāramitāšāstra) , I, Louvain, 1966, p. 466); there is a very similar passage in another Chinese Buddhist text, the Zapiyujing% tlfnM, T. IV 207: 529b9-14. Compar- ing the passages from the Yamato Katsuragi hõzankiy the Dazhidulun and the Zapiyujing , we can be sure that the author of the Shintõ work used the Dazhidulun (see also Agatsuma Matashirõ "Chùsei Bukkyõ-shintõ ni okeru Bon-tennõ shisõ" Terakoya gogaku-bunka kenkyü jo ronsõ 1982, p. 47 and n. 8). The dif- ference between the two Buddhist texts being minimal, it may seem unimportant to determine the exact source of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki. However, another passage from the latter work clearly refers to a passage in the Dazhidulun : we find in the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki the following statement: "The tradition says: At the beginning of the kalpa, there existed a sacred being named Permanently Compassionate Divine King (he is called 'Deva king Mahābrahmā Sikhin [Shiki daibon tennõ in the language of the Law [hõgo îÉi§], and Ame no minakanushi no mikoto in the language of gods [jingo #!§]). He resides in the Deva Palace of Mahābrahmā and has a wide and great thought of Compassion and Sincerity for the beings. Thus, he created one hundred billion suns and moons, and one hundred billion Deva Brahmā (hyakuoku nichigachi oyobi hyakuoku Bonten to save ( watasu St) an unlimited number of beings. This is why he is the great ancestor of all the devaputras , and he is the original master of the Trichilio-megachiliocosm" ( Yamato Katsuragi hõzankiy Itõ ed., p. 619). - Now, there is a passage from the Dazhidulun where we can read: "The Deva king Brahma who is the sovereign of the Trichilio-megachiliocosm is Sikhin (Shiki ÄÜ)" (T. XXV 1509: 58a26; see Lamotte, op. cit.f I, p. 13). The transliteration of the name "Sikhin" used in the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki is different from the one found in the Dazhidulun. Agatsuma ( ibid ., p. 49 and n. 15, 16) showed that the transliteration P'Ü is based on the introductory chapter of the Lotus Sütra (T. IX 262: 2a 18- 19), where two Mahābrahmā are enumerated, masters of the Saha world Sikhin and Jyotisprabha, J. Shiki daibon and Kõmyõ daibon But the statement according to which Mahābrahmā Sikhin is the "master of the Trichilio-megachilicosm" is certainly based on the Dazhidulun. - We can also note that the impressive cosmic vision of "one hundred billion suns and moons, and one hundred billion Deva Brahma" has its counterpart in the Dazhidulun , T. 1509: 113c26 We find the phrase in the Fahua yishu mmmm by Jizang tsM (T. XXXIV 1721: 464c21), and the Hokke kaijishõ by Jõkei ñU (1155-1213) (T. LVI 2195: 274b3), or in the Konkõmyõ saishõõ-kyõ gensü by Gangyõ WÊ (835-871) (T. LVI 2196: 539cll), or another similar phrase in the Shingonshü kyõjigi ÄUth &amp;mm by Annen (841 - between 889 to 898) (T. LXXV 2396: 435b2). 6. This myth is known in many Hindu texts, such as the Mahãbhãrata and the Bhãgavata Purāņa. See for example R. G. Bhandarkar, Vaisņavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems , Strasbourg, 1913, pp.30-32; Madeleine Biardeau, Etudes de mythologie hindoue , I, Cosmogonies purãniques, Publications de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient, vol. 128, Paris: Adrien Maison-</page><page sequence="4">266 Iyanaga Nobumi of heterodox (or non-Buddhist) teaching (gedõ In the Dazhidulun itself, it is mentioned as a story of the "secular world" ( sezoku (T. 1509: 116al5). Indeed, creationism, as it appears in this Indian myth and others, was consistently criticized in Buddhist texts until the rise of Tantrism. The parallels that this narrative shares with the classical Japanese myth of cosmogony as it is found in the Nihon shoki 0 probably contributed to its inclusion in the Yamato Katsuragi hõzankiy but it is surprising that the authors of the Shintõ work went so far as to find it in the great corpus of Buddhist texts, without noting its heterodox character - because it is clear that they did not mean to advocate a doctrine contrary to Buddhism. A close comparison of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki passage with its source in the Dazhidulun reveals some interesting details. First, the name of the primordial deity "Ikõ" MM8 in the Shintõ work is rendered "Bichū" the usual translitera- tion of the name Visņu, in the Buddhist text. The character "f" M was certainly chosen because its form is similar to that of it means "reed" ( ashi W). In the Nihon shoki version of the myth, a "reed sprout," "ashi-kabi" ÜiSF, is the "first thing" that appeared "between Heaven and Earth" {ame tsuchi no naka ni hitotsu no mono nareri. Katachi ashi-kabi nogotoshi ( NKBT 67, pp. 76-77). Another difference between the Dazhidulun and the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki is the phrase "on the water was born by transformation a sacred being" (suijõ ni kami keshõ shite ?R_h#SHt£) which appears in the latter text as variation on the formers simpler "on the water, there was a person with a thousand heads [and...]" (shuishang youyiqiantou ren 7jc±#^Ťg|Á). The word "ffffi" which is read as "kami" certainly comes from the first cosmogonie myth of the Nihon shokiy which explains "... After [Heaven and Earth were formed] , a sacred being (kami) came to exist between the two" (shikõ shite nochi kami sono naka ni are masu (NKBT 67, pp. 76-77). 9 The word shensheng is of rather rare usage in Chinese sources; it occurs most often in its adjectival meaning, in conjunction with imperial referents such as tianzi or bixia STF, modifying them as in " sacred Son of Heaven" or " sacred Majesty," and so on.10 A commentary on the Nihon shoki that dates back to the neuve, 1981, pp. 51-52. 7. The Waidao xiaocheng niepan lun (T. XXXII 1640: 157al 1-19) and the commentary on the Madhyamaka-iastra by Jizang the Zbongguan lun shu (T. XLII 1824: 14c4-16), which quotes the former (see Lamotte, op.cit ., I, p. 466 and n. 2). See also an old Indian commentary on the Ekottarãgama , the Fenbie gongdelun (T. XXV 1507: 31a8-13). 8. There are several variants of this name depending on the manuscript: some have AT with "W" as a variant for others have "*$3" with the variant this shows that the copyists had difficulties in understanding the meaning of this name (see Itõ Satoshi OTiflS, "Hokekyõ to chùsei jingi sho: Toku ni Kamakura-ki ryõbu-shintõ sho ni okeru Bon tennõ setsu o megutte" in Kokubungaku : Kaishaku to kanshõ special issue 'Hokekyõ' to chüsei bungei 1997, pp. 50-5 land n. 3). 9. Kadoya Atsushi assisted me with the interpretation of this passage (see the mailing list kuden-ML , messages entitled "Where is the 'shinsei'," dated 2009/03/01). I would like to express my gratitude to him. 10. See for example Xin Tangshu frirļt (Zhonghua shuju Liechuang xci,</page><page sequence="5">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism' 26 7 early tenth century, the Nihon shoki shiki teihon quotes a Chinese work entitled Sanwu liji fB with regard to the above phrase. This lost work, purportedly written in the kingdom of Wu ä during the third century, is credited with recording that "at the beginning of world, there was a sacred [being] (shensheng) named tianhuang with one body with thirteen heads."11 This is an interesting detail: on the one hand, we may assume that the myth from the Nihon shoki was based on this Chinese text; on the other hand, we can conceive that the author(s) of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki knew not only about the Nihon shoki (this can be inferred from the allusion to the reed in the name of the primordial god "Ikõ" M ^), but also about the Sanwu liji (perhaps through the same quotation from the Nihon shoki shiki). If this is true, we may deduce another reason for which they were interested in this cosmogonie fable of Hindu mythology. The mention of a primordial god with "a thousand heads and two thousand hands and feet" can point to the "sacred being with thirteen heads" from the Sanwu liji. The authors of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki could have wanted to posit a more powerful god than the primordial deity of the Nihon shokiy with many more heads, hands and feet. The Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki is a rather special case in the series of early Shintõ texts from the late twelfth- to late thirteenth centuries, in the sense that it is not directly related to Ise shrine, but rather to the Shugendõ of Katsuragi mountains. The Dazhidulun myth from the beginning of this text is rarely quoted in other Shintõ materials - except the Tenchi reiki fu roku which in naming its source as the "Treatise," "row" fra, cites the exact text of the Dazhidulun.12 This p. 3784: " tianzi shensheng" ibid., cxii, p. 4175: "bixia shensheng yongzhť - It is perhaps significant that a little earlier than the compilation of the Nihon shoki (completed in 720), empress Wu Zhao ÄR3 cherished the word shengshen IM and used it in several of her titles, such as shengshen huangdi WWUffi y jinlun shengshen huangdi yuegu jinlun shengshen huangdi Tiance jinlun dasheng huangdi 11.

[Dominic Steavu, who kindly reviewed and corrected the English of this paper, points out that in the Daoist work entitled Badi miaojingjing Afiîl&amp;ifëM (CT 640, 7a), there is the following passage: The coincidence is surprising, and worth noting.] This phrase from the Sanwu liji might have been one of the sources of for the title. - Lone Takeuchi called my attention to the word " shensheng/ shinsei" fäÜ; Kanazawa Hideyuki pointed out both this quotation from the Nihon shoki shiki and the article by Kõnoshi ftlīāS that follows.

Annen and Buddhist Devas in early medieval Shintõ There are several trends in the early medieval Shintõ discourse on Buddhist Devas. It is possible to trace some of these back to Annen's thought. Among the most important of these are: different when the Buddhist source is identified: in the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki , the myth is presented as a genuine revelation, while in the Tenchi reiki furoku quotation, the reader knows that it is a Buddhist perspective. 13. All of these works belong to the Ise shrine lineage. See Ruiju fingi hongen Korenshū ST, Ise Shintõ, jõ -±, p. 407, pp. 572-573; Gengenshü ŤtŤtM, Masamune Atsuo ed., Nihon koten bungaku zenshù 39, 1934, p.5. 14. Jinnõ keizu in Ise Shintöshü p. 630, p. 631: - Note that the phrase "people in Heaven and on Earth (^i&amp;AK)," which may seem rather common, is in fact very rare: there are only eleven occurrences in all eighty- five volumes of the Taishõ Canon; all of them are based on the Dazhidulun passage quoted above. 15. Another intriguing point common to all these myths is the importance attributed to Ame no minakanushi no mikoto. In the Nihon shoki, this god appears only once, in the quota- tion from "one of the different traditions" ( issho ni iwaku - ' Its) (NKBT 67, pp. 78-79), while in the Kofiki it is the first deity mentioned ( NKBT 1, p. 50). Since the Kofiki was practically unknown during the medieval period, the reason why this god became so important in Ise shrine traditions remains a mystery.</page><page sequence="7">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 269 1.

The discourse on īsāna (Ishana-ten which is associated to Izanagi and Izanami Other than these three traditions, the Shingon fuhõ sanyõshõ by Seison (1012-1074), which had a crucial influence on the formation of medieval Shinto thought, also displays some elements that are evocative of Annen's views on mythology. Since Seison stands at the chronological midpoint between Annen (late ninth century) and the emergence of the medieval Shintö works (late twelfth century), we will first examine his text and consider how it reflects Annen's speculations. Annen and Seisons Shingon fuhõ sanyõshõ In 1060, Seison, disciple of the founder of the Ono-ryù /MřSK, Ningai (951- 1046), dedicated his short work on the history of the transmission of the Shingon School, the Shingon fuhõ sanyõshõ , to the heir prince Takahito Wn - who was to become Emperor Go-Sanjõ (1034-1073, r. 1068-1073) - for whom he acted in the capacity of protector monk (gojisõ Hfêftf).16 Towards the end of this work, we find the following passage:17 To begin with, among the eighty- four thousand cities in Jambudvīpa, it is only in this Sunny Valley (yõkoku W&amp;, Japan) that the secret teaching will be prosper: I explained this already. In olden times, the Bodhisattva Ikõ WLftMW. (Majestic Light) (the deity Marici, a transformation body of Mahāvairocana) always resided in the Sun palace ( nichigū 0 H) and resolved the trouble pertaining to the King of Asuras (ashura-õ no nan MfëfêÎ il). Now, Vajra of Pervasive Light (Henjõ kongõ [the Esoteric name of Kūkai]) eternally lives in the Sun Region (Nichiiki 0i$; Japan) to increase the good fortune of the Saintly King of the Golden Wheel (Konrin jõõ ^ilī, cakravartiny here, the Japanese imperial dynasty). [Our country's] god is named Tenshõ-son [or Amaterasu no mikoto] ^88^ (the Venerated One who Shines in the Sky), and the country is named "Country of the Origin of the Sun" (Nihon-koku 0#IÜ). It is the spontaneous [or self-existing] principle (jinen no ri which gives the spontaneous names (finen no myõ £). All this is truly based on this [spontaneity?] ( makoto ni kore wo moto to suru yue nari IfàlfêWtóÈ^). This is why, [in the same way that] the Iron stūpa of Southern India (Nan-Ten tetto Üí^gfcíg) includes the entire Mind Palace of the Dharma Realm ( hokkai shinden iÊIÊ'hIH!) despite its small size, the Sunny Valley of the Eastern Vehicle (Tõjõ 16.

Thus, we clearly know that [all this] is the effect of the sacramental power ( kajiriki of the Tathāgata Mahāvairocana (Dainichi nyorai Tathāgata Great Sun). How could this be known by foolish, ordinary people? Since this is a text offered to an imperial prince, it is very rhetorical, and con- siderably difficult to penetrate. Nevertheless, the reliance of the passage on solar symbolism is readily discernible (for example, we find expressions like "Sunny Valley," yõkoku , "Sun Palace," nichigū , "Sun Region," nichiiki , "Vajra of Pervasive Light," Henjõ kongõ, "the Venerated One who Shines in the Sky," Tenshõ-son, and so on). The sentence which reveals that "Vajra of Pervasive Light eternally lives in the Sun Region to increase the good fortune of the Saintly King of the Golden Wheel" is a reference to Kùkai's mummy - resting in a meditative state in the Inner Hall (oku no in Ä?)ßt) of Kõyasan until the coming of the next Buddha Maitreya - and the protection it confers on the imperial family. The end of the passage explains that " [in the same way that] the Iron stūpa of Southern India includes the entire Mind Palace of the Dharma Realm despite its small size, the Sunny Valley of the Eastern Vehicle, although it is a remote and provincial region, is [inhabited by] all the great [noble] clans [destined to Enlightenment through the Esoteric teach- ing] ." Although Japan is a small country, far removed from the center of the world which was considered to be at the place of the Buddhas enlightenment (Bodh-gaya in India), it is on the archipelago that Esoteric Buddhism prospers the most. It is an argument to contradict the prevailing pessimistic opinion of the period, which considered Japan as a "remote little land like a scattered grain of millet" ( zokusan - bendo Hifc?S±). We must remember that this era was dominated by the fear of the Last Period of the Buddha's Law. Studies have established that it is against this largely fatalistic background that the ideology of "Japan as Divine Country" (shinkoku shisõ was established. The most important aspect of this excerpt is that it provides for the first time the fundamental idea that Japan is the "Country of the Origin of the Sun." Its principal deity, "the One who Shines in the Sky" [Amaterasu Okami] , is protected by the spirit of a monk named "Vajra of Pervasive Light," who "corresponds" in a mysteri- ous way to the Buddha Mahāvairocana - whose name is translated as "Great Sun" (Dainichi) or the "Pervasive Light" (Henjõ ®fiS). The idea that "it is the sponta- neous [or self-existing] principle which gives the spontaneous names" is based on the primal mantric linguistic philosophy that characterizes Tantric metaphysics.18 18. This important concept of "natural names" seems to be based on a passage from Kūkai's work on siddham characters, the Bonji shittan jimo shakugi T. LXXXIV 2701 36 lal 1-15: "According to the Dai Birushana kyõ it is said that the characters are the creation of the spontaneous principle (jinen dõri they are created neither by Tathāgata, nor by King Brahmā or other Devas.

The document contains a short gloss explaining the phrase " y omo no kuni literally "the country of four directions": it refers to the "Country of Dainihon, that is, the Palace of Dainichi, the World Land" ( Dainihon-shü nari, Dainichi-gū, sekai kokudo nari Thus, Japan is equated with the entire World! The main mythological arguments in Seison's text identify the Bodhisattva Ikõ (Majestic Light) with the Buddha Mahāvairocana; they also identify this same Ikõ with Marici, who is described in turn as "a transformation body of the Buddha Mahāvairocana," residing in Sun palace ( nichigū BK), and who "resolved the trouble pertaining to the King of Asuras." The association of the "Bodhisattva Ikõ," Bodhisattva of Majestic Light, with the "transformation body of Mahāvairocana" certainly relies on a passage from the Jingang dingjing áèBJM®, where the Buddha is said to have taken the Vow of the Great Bodhisattva of the Great Majestic Light (Dai-ikõ dai-bosatsu sanmaya SIHtt®). This produces a light compared to a gathering of many great sun- wheels (shuta dai nichirin ^:#^;Bîra), constituting a shape of the Vajra Sun- wheel (Kongo nichirin á^HIBfw) in the palm of the Buddha; and from this Vajra Sun-wheel is born a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named "Great Majestic Light" (Dai-ikõ bosatsu 369c27-370a3. - Kùkai's quotation cannot be found in the Mahāvairocana-sūtra (.

The text that the Asabashõ cites is a most interesting one: we may divide it into three sections, the first of which defines "the Bodhisattva Marici" as a "Vow of Mahāvairocana" (Dainichi sanmaya The second section is a long sequence of quotations from different authors on the problem of the place of Mahābrahmā in the hierarchy of Buddhist Heavens, and the expanse of worlds corresponding to each stage of the Heavens. Since this concern is characteristic of Annen's other doctrinal works, we may consider it corroboration for the presumption that the Marishiten yõki was extracted from one of his texts. We should notice however that it is very difficult to determine the original texts that are quoted there - this is typical of Annen's quotations. The third and final section relates a very peculiar myth in which Marici plays an important role in the war between Indra s army and the Asuras. Leaving the second section for later discussion, we will first examine the first and third sections. But I must first say a word about Marici himself: the Sanskrit word " marīci ," means "ray of light of Sun or Moon" or "mirage." In Hindu mythology, the deity Marlei is regarded as a son of Svayambhù, or a son of Brahma. In the Japanese tradition, it seems that the deity was appreciated for its name's phantasmagoric connotations: since a mirage cannot be captured or struck, Marici was especially worshipped as a protector god of warriors. The first section in Annen's text is presented as a short quotation from a ritual work on Marici. It says: "According to the Ritual text of the Deity Marīci (Marishi- ten giki 0fU;£;Rftl$l) translated by Amoghavajra, it is said that the bodhisattva Marici is [born from] a Vow of Mahāvairocana (Dainichi sanmaya who has entered the Concentration of the Metaphor of the Sun ( nichi-yu zanmai he is a subordinate of the Deity Sùrya."26 Unfortunately, like many of Annen's references, this passage cannot be located, despite the fact that a ritual text entitled "Molizhi pusa liie niansongfa " ?È, translated by Amoghavajra does exist (T. XXI 1258). Even the expression nichiyu zanmaiy "Concentration of the Metaphor of the Sun" cannot be found in the Indian and Chinese sections of the Taishõ Canon.

According to Annen, the latter is directly related to Mahāvairocana, and to the Sun, just like the Bodhisattva of Majestic Light in the Jingangdingjing. The third section is a long narration of a Marici myth. Surprisingly, and con- trary to his habit, Annen does not mention any references, so we are compelled to look for them ourselves. The result is truly surprising since there appears to be no source for this myth. There are many canonical texts or commentaries that narrate myths related to the war between the Devas and the Asuras, a battle that began with Sakra abducting the daughter of the Asura King Vemacitra.28 But no text, to my knowledge I am aware of, has a story that Annen could have used for the basis of his myth. In addition, I have been unable to find a passage relating the battle between the Devas and the Asuras in which Marici helps the Devas. My reluctant conclusion is that Annen, using many versions of the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, added significant portions, and invented this "Hindu-like" myth:29 [At the beginning of the kalpa,] the Ābhāsvara deities [deities of Radiant Sound] descended onto Jambudvlpa and gave birth to a child. It was Vemacitra, the king of Asuras. This Asura king gave birth to a daughter; her form was like that of a Deva maiden, noble and very delicate. Her name was Sari. [Vemacitra] wanted to give her to the Asura king Rāhu as his consort; but Sakra devendrá abducted her with his supernatural power and brought her to [his] Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods. Summoning Visvakarman, he made him build the city Sudarśana. The latter built a city of ten thousand houses in a time corresponding to seven days in the human world, adorning them with seven jewels 27. Dari jingshu Xmm, T. XXXIX 1796: 618cl8-19: - The same text can be found in the Putixinyi by Haiyun MM, T. XLVI 1953: 988al2-13. 28. The Guanfo sanmei hai jing (T. XV 643: 646cl4-647bll) relates a myth according to which Indra married Sari, daughter of the Asura king Vemacitra; when she saw Indra fornicating with a palace maiden, she became jealous and told her father about the incident. This angered Vemacitra, who declared war against Indra and his Deva army. Indra eventually won the war on account of the protection afforded by a Prajnãpãramitã dhāraņī. Zhiyi in his commentary on the Lotus sūtra, the Miaofa lianhuajing wenju (T. XXXIV 1718: 2 25b2-l 1. b 13-20), adds to this story an episode according to which the Asura Rāhu ate the Sun and Moon. On the other hand, the Zhengfa nianchu jing^fè^WÊ (T XVII 721: 107al0-108a09) tells a long story in which it is said that the Asura Rāhu wanted to see a Deva maiden, but was unable to because he was blinded by the Sun. mm io ä« B$m0 utt&amp;ftgBKraeff mmm ij^±0 su iïo wft (äüs. mm b ñ « mmrn. mm tmxk- nm0 m* mmmm 0 mtmīftto m t¡0 nmmmā «. m&amp;Pëo a jfcfilSSKEHiiHth&amp;Âgtto m + A B HHUKB. t¡0 símaos««</page><page sequence="12">274 Iyanaga Nobumi and covering them all with Indras net. On each node of this net, there were ten or a hundred thousand rings, and their glitter together with their sound were [extremely beautiful] . Saci was a prisoner [of this city] , and slept there. Then, the two Asura kings raised the four armies and lined them up on the Ocean. Other Asura Kings, with their armies of millions and tens of millions of soldiers, appeared at the bottom of sea. Unfathomable in their numbers, they all ascended up to the Heavenly palace to get Sací back. At that time, the Sun and Moon gods (Sùrya and Candra) emitted a pure light to strike the Asura kings' pupils. The Asura king Rāhu tried to capture the two gods, but the Bodhisattva Marici, with his great powers of skillful means manifested in the form of a three-year old boy and obscured the palaces of Sun and Moon, so that the raging Asura kings were blinded. It is also [said that] with the Method for Concealing the Form, he could hinder Asura kings from knowing [the place where the deities Sun and Moon were] , so that Sakra devendrá would always obtain victory over Asura armies. (According to another account, it is said that the deity Marici always helped and protected the King of Gods [Sakra] and the Sun and Moon; he always hid them with a cloak akin to a delicate bird cage that presents a [delusional?] aspect to the world). On the sixteenth day of every month, Sakra devendrá organizes the ceremony of the Great Prajnãpãramitã preaching, and brings seventy thousand million subordinates under the order of the sixteen divine kings of the Prajnãpãramitã (hannya jüroku jinnõ Jtë ^-h/N#ī)30 and the Great King Deep Sands (Jinja daiõ He [Sakra devendrá] goes to war carrying his sword of wisdom. He instantaneously defeats and cuts down all the Asura armies, then deploys a number of his subordinates [to prepare for new battles] . The bodies of the Asura kings and other Asuras fall into the sea, and are broken into innumerable pieces. However, the Asura kings and their soldiers have a medicine of immortality between their teeth, and despite being scattered into pieces, each of them collect the pieces of their disintegrated bodies and with their resuscitarne powers bring themselves back to life; then all the Asura kings return to their original palace. They always suffer this way, and because they have a strong desire to vanquish others (?), they start over the battle on the sixteenth day of every month. This is the reason why the King of Gods [Sakra] longs for the power o f prajnãpãramitã. All buddhas and provisional beings are on the King of Gods' side. This is why the Bodhisattva Marici helps him with his great supernatural power of skillful means. We can be certain that Seison was referring to Annen's work when writing that "the Bodhisattva Ikõ ĀtĒStŪ (Majestic Light) [identified with the deity Marici, a transformation body of Mahāvairocana] always resided in the Sun palace ( nichigū B HO and resolved the trouble pertaining to the King of Asuras ( ashura-õ no nan M{&amp; ūžEū)." Indras immortality is well-known in Hindu mythology, but in this Bud- dhist context, it becomes more intriguing, especially in light of the statement that "the buddhas and provisional beings [bodhisattvas] are on the King of Gods' side." This ethical distortion results from the narrative conventions of the myth whereby the Asura kings embody the archetypal villain while Sakra devendrá incarnates the quintessential hero figure. The Asura kings were in possession of a beautiful woman named Saci, but Sakra makes away with her, and a battle ensues. In this battle, 30.

This distortion recalls the medieval Shintõ myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven. All of its variant forms roughly tell the same story: The existing world, and all the beings in it, belonged to Māra. When Amaterasu was about to create Japan, Māra foresaw that Buddhism would prosper in this new country. This would permit people to escape his realm, and so he descended from his Sixth Heaven to hinder her. Amaterasu deceived him, promising that she would never tolerate Bud- dhism. Under these conditions, she was permitted to create Japan, and because of this promise, Buddhism is taboo in Ise Shrine in spite of the fact that Amaterasu was actually a staunch protector of Buddhism.31 Annen's myth is certainly more complicated, but the essential features are very similar. In the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven, the latter embodies the villain while Amaterasu is the heroin. The disputed item is the country of Japan. This item, which was originally King Māras possession, is re-appropriated in a sense by Amaterasu, a solar symbol, who employs fraudulent means to achieve her end. Thus, we may suppose some relation between Annen's myth on the battle between the Devas and the Asuras, and the medieval myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven. Annen and the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven Granted, the relation between Annen's Marici myth and the medieval myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven may not be explicit. Seison's text on the "solar character" of Japan on the other hand, displays comparatively clearer similarities with the Shintõ legend:32 both sources mention Amaterasu (the latter unequivo- cally associates her with Marici); the Asura K ing assumes the role of the villain in Annen's myth, while Māra inherit this role in the Shintõ version. On the other hand, in many variants of the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven, we encounter the famous motif of "Japan as the Original Country of Dainichi," which manifestly derives from the Seison's texte. 31. There are many studies on this myth. I will mention only some of them: Ito Satoshi &amp; "Dairokuten Maõ setsu no seiritsu: Tokuni ' Nakatomi no harae kunge no shosetsu o chùshin toshite" Nihon bungaku 447, 1995; Id., "Shasekishü to chùsei shintõ-setsu: Bõtõ-wa 'Daijingù no koto' o megutte" ìilfó Setsuwa bungaku kenkyü 35, 2000; Id.

See Abe Yasurõ, "Maõ tono keiyaku," pp. 109-110.</page><page sequence="14">276 Iyanaga Nobumi There is one particular version of that myth in the first chapter of the Keiranshüyöshü that is of special interest because of its close relation with Seisons text:33 Concerning our country's name, "Dainihon-koku," it is recorded that in a secret conversation, it was said: "Someone (Chùkai [b. 1 160; an important master of Tendai esotericism, active until the early thirteenth century]) said that Mahāvairocana, after realizing the enlightenment at the pinnacle of the Form Realm, threw down the heavenly spear into the ocean of Jambudvîpa. A foam was produced on the ocean's surface when the spear entered it, and it coagulated to become a country. This is the country of Japan." [...] Personally, I think that [the Deity of] the Great shrine of Ise is the Trace Left by Mahāvairocana. Then, some lines further:34 Concerning three kinds of numinous Jewels ( reihõ S W):35 The Divine Seal (shinji WS) [is] the Figure [or Chart] of the Country ( kokuzu mm)36, the anthropomorphic [mandala] 33. Keiranshüyöshü (T. LXXVI 2410: 511a4-10): 34. Keiranshüyöshü , (T. LXXVI 2410: 511b5-15): »as, wmmîmfàm&amp;imss) " 35. The following lines present the different correspondences of the three imperial regalia with regard to different aspects of reality: 1. categories of mandala ( mahā-maņdala , samaya- maņdala , and btja-maņdala ); 2. categories of sütras (Susiddhikara-sütra, Vajraiekhara-sütra , and Mahävairocana-sütra ); 3. categories of Buddha's body ( nirmãna-kãyay sambhoga-kãya and dharma-kãya) . 36. It seems that for the medieval Japanese, the reality of the Divine Seal ( shinshi or shinji #11) was particularly difficult to represent. Thus, we find different understandings of what it was. Some of these are found in other versions of the myth of King Māra. In the Taiheiki IB (NKBT., 35, p. 167), for instance, we read: "... Then, King Māra of the Sixth Heaven calmed his anger and made his blood spew from the five parts of his body (gotai yori chi wo ayashi 5 and [with this blood] wrote a contract of firm promise, in which it said: 'Until the end of times, let the descendants of the Great Deity Amaterasu be the sovereigns of this country! If there are those who, disobeying the King's order, throw disturbance in the country and cause the people to suffer, then one hundred eighty thousand subordinates of mine will rush up from morning until night to punish and kill them.' And he gave this contract to the Great Deity Amaterasu. This is one of the views [explaining the origin of] the current Divine Seal." Another version of the same myth in the Shinto sanshu no inju a manuscript of the Hõbodai-in of Tõji writes: "... According to another view, it is said that the Divine Seal is Amaterasu oonkami's written oath ( kishõ sho fëlSit) to King Māra, promising to not protect Buddhism. It is on the basis of this written oath that the country could be realized, and the Four Seas could be governed. This is the Jewel of Regal Longevity (? e õi no juhõ nari fôîfëûîïte). Yet another view propounds that it is the plan [or chart] of the Country ( kuni no sashizu mJüíSI)." I owe this information to a personal communication with Itõ Satoshi, to whom I am deeply grateful. - The word " sashizu " usually refers to a building plan or a map. - See also Tanaka Takako BWjtŤ, "' Keiranshüyöshü ni okeru õken to jingi" Mí in Imatani Akira ed., Õken to jingi 3LfêLWffày Kyoto, Shibunkaku shuppan /K, 2002, pp. 183-190.</page><page sequence="15">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism' 277 in Venerable form (songyõ OT2);37 it is the Susiddhikara[-sūtra' , the Transformation Body [of the Buddha] .

You should ponder on [the fact that our country is] called Dainihon-koku. Concerning the interdiction for monks to make the pilgrimage to [Ise] Shrine: In olden times, the Great Deity Amaterasu was in the Sun palace; she made a promise to the king of Asuras. This is the reason. Speculations on the three "numinous Jewels," that is to say, the three regalia, are typically convoluted. Nonetheless, the authors attempts to associate these spe- cifically Japanese regalia to universal Buddhist values are fairly clear; the passage contains the characteristic expression "the Seal of the Buddha Mahāvairocana at the bottom of the Ocean" which is encountered in the first story of the Shasekishū one of the classic versions of the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven, and an early repository of the idea of Japan as the "Original Country of Dainichi." The last short sentences, addressing the origin of the taboo on Buddhism at Ise, is of particular interest since it states that Amaterasu resided in the Sun Palace. Recall that another resident of the Sun Palace in Seison's text is the Bodhisattva of Majestic Light, who is a transformation of the Buddha Mahāvairocana, identified with Marici. The passage also mentions Amaterasus dealings with the Asura king, who is featured in Seison's and Annen's works. Although this version of the myth of Māra is not the earliest one (the Shasekishū version is earlier, and the allusion in the Nakatomi no harae kunge is much earlier; see below), I would venture to say that this version of the Keiranshüyöshü might represent the original form, of the myth from the logical or narrative standpoint. We have noted above that the Nakatomi no harae kunge is one of the oldest texts to present the notion of "Japan as the Original Country of Dainichi." This same text is also the earliest to contain an allusion to the myth of King Māra: in it, we can read that at the beginning of the time "when Heaven and Earth opened up, and the Divine Jewel Sun manifested, the Buddha Mahāvairocana of the Dharma Realm and Dharma Body, the king of mind ( hokkai hosshin shinnõ Dainichi ffilřííJNiLJcB), 37.

[...] The Great Deity [Amaterasu] manifested in a cult superficially different from the Buddhist teaching, but on the inside [in his or her mind] , he [or she] became a divine protector and soldier of the Buddhas Law."39 This excerpt contains rather oblique references, which seem to presuppose the reader s familiarity with the myth. This allows us to assume that it was widely disseminated even earlier than the Nakatomi no harae kunge s date of composition (before 1191).40 The influence of Annen's speculation is more apparent in another allusion to the same myth. It is found in the Tenchi Reikiki chapter of the Reikiki a very curious medieval Shintõ cycle of texts dating back to the end of the Kamakura period.41 [In the beginning,] the Two Great Deities [Izanagi and Izanami] married and governed forever the world under Heaven. [...] They created Heaven from Yang and purity and the Earth from the heavy and the impure. Afterwards, Heaven and Earth were fixed in a mild brilliance, and they made kamis in Heaven and men on Earth. Then, for a period of one hundred billion kalpas , there was no master among the nine mountains and eight seas (kusen hakkai AlUAfà; the Sumeru world). At that time, Īsāna-Mahesvara of the Sixth Heaven, the Pisāca-Mahesvara ( dairokuten no Izana-Makeshura, Bishaja-Makeishura i was trembling and rumbling in anger ( meidõfunnu lliü and there was no soul under Heaven. Then, the Son of the Deva Moon, one of the Three Lights of Pervasive Shinning ( henjõsanmyõ nogattenshi descended and became the Deity of the Firm Earth (kenrõ-chi-jin Ü^i&amp;fá)...42 Here, the curious deity name "dairokuten no Izana-Makeshura, Bishaja- Makeishura" cannot be understood without considering Annen's theory of the two kinds of Mahesvara that will be examined in the next section.

It is difficult to understand the reason why Annen inserted these quotations in his text on Marici; perhaps it was to introduce the myth of the cosmic war between the Devas and the Asuras, which begins with a brief descrip- tion of the origins of the kalpa. At any rate, similar discussions on the hierarchy of Buddhist Heavens can be found in other works by the same author, such as the first chapter of his treatise on siddham , the Shittan zõ (T. LXXXIV 2702), and more especially, his two main doctrinal treatises, the Shingonshū kyõjigi ÂlÎTKÉfcNfli (T. LXXV 2396) [hereafter abbreviated as Kyõjigi] and the Taizõ Kongo Bodaishingi ryakumondõshõ (T. LXXV 2397) [hereafter abbreviated as Bodaishingi-shõ' . In these two treatises, the passages on the hierarchy of Buddhist Heavens appear in the same context:45 Annen raises the question of the subjugation of hindering gods in different Tantric sources, and attempts to reconcile apparent discrepancies between various narrations. He quotes a number of texts that present the subjugation of different forms of gods by Buddhist agents at each stage of the cosmos, from the pinnacle of the Form Realm, which was the original place of the Buddha Mahāvairocana's enlightenment, to the top of Mount Sumeru, where the Buddha Sakyamuni subjugated Māra (who is identified with īsāna). Furthermore, in the Bodaishingi-shõ , this theoretical framework is combined with the esoteric doctrine of the Buddhas four or five bodies, namely the Self-Nature Body (jishõ-shin Ětt#), the Self-Enjoyment Body ( jijuyü-shin the Enjoyment Body for Others ( tajuyü-shin íteSfflJj'), the Transformation Body ( henge-shin SÜHbUO and the Natural Outflow Body ( tõru-shin UMt#).46 These bodies are in turn associated with 43.

In the middle of this discussion, Annen refers to a passage from the Mahãyãna- avatãra sastra (Nyü daijõ-ron AA^Iw), a work by a certain Sāramati of the late fourth century. Here is how he cites it:47 [According to] the Mahãyãna-avatãra sastra , there are two kinds of Mahesvara: one is Pisāca-Mahesvara who is the sovereign of the Fourth Meditation [Heaven] , and the other is Īšāna-Mahesvara who is the sovereign of the Sixth Heaven. Unfortunately, this quotation is erroneous. The original text of the Mahãyãna- avatãra sastra discusses the ten ascending "grounds" (jūji daía-bhümi ) of the bodhisattva in Mahãyãna doctrine; each bodhisattva "ground" corresponds to a status in a Buddhist cosmological stage, the so-called "Fruits of Merit" (fukka punya-phala ).48 Thus, the Fruit of Merit of the first ground is the kingship of Jambdvīpa, that of the second ground is to become cakravartin , that of the third ground is to become Sakra devendrá, that of the fourth ground is to become king of the Heaven of Yama, that of the fifth ground is to become king of the Heaven of Tusita, that of the sixth ground is to become king of the Heaven of Nirmāņarati, that of the seventh ground is to become king of the Heaven of Paranirmita-vasavartin (which is none other than King Māra of the Sixth Heaven), that of the eighth ground is to become Brahmā of a single chiliocosm, that of the ninth ground is to become Brahmā of a Duochiliocosm, and that of the tenth ground is to become the Deva-king of the Trichiliomegachiliocosm in the Heaven of Suddhāvāsa, which corresponds to the pinnacle of the Fourth Meditation Heaven and the Form Realm. What is of interest for our purpose in this enumeration is that this last king of the Suddhāvāsa Heaven is identified with Mahesvara in a number of Mahãyãna works, most notably the Mahãyãna-avatãra sastra. This raises an important question: since Mahesvara is the name of Siva, is it possible that the bodhisattva of the tenth ground is identified with a Hindu god that was reputed to be a violent, wrathful deity? This is the subject of a "Question and Answer," which goes as follows:49 Question: This Mahesvara of which you talk, is it the same as the Mahesvara of the Mundane speech? Answer: It is īsvara of the [Heaven of] Suddhāvāsa, it is not the īšvara of the Mundane speech. Although the Mahesvara of which you talk has the same name, they are not the same. There is Mahesvara of the [Heaven of] Suddhāvāsa, and there is Pisāca-Mahesvara 47. Bodaishingi-shõ , T. LXXV 2397: 547cl5-17: 48. Mahãyãna-avatãra íãstra , T.

The one of the [Heaven of] Suddhāvāsa is a bodhisattva, so close to the Buddha ground that he is separated from it as if only by gauze. He is able to completely know all the numberless dharmas of all the worlds of the ten directions in an instant. This is the text that Annen claims to quote in his Bodaishingi-shõ that we trans- lated above. We can see how Annen mistakenly identified "Pisāca-Mahesvara," the demonic Hindu god, with the sovereign of the Fourth Meditation Heaven - that is the bodhisattva of the tenth ground - and posited Īsāna-Mahesvara as "the sovereign of the Sixth Heaven," a position normally identified with King Māra (of the Sixth Heaven). This sovereign of the Sixth Heaven, the Paranirmita-vasavartin Heaven, is usually named Vasavartin, which is translated into Chinese as Zizai tian (J. Jizai-ten) ĚÍE;^; the fact that "īsvara," another name for Mahesvara, was also translated by the same word was a major cause of confusion.50 On the other hand, īsāna, which is another name for Siva, usually designates the guardian deity of the Northeast in the group of twelve guardian deities of directions. In a passage from the Chishengguang fading yigui the name īsāna is rendered as Zizai tian in the expression "Zizai tian of the North-eastern Realm of Desire" #ê£3^).51 However, in most cases the name is transliterated as typically pronounced "Ishana" in Japanese. However, Odas Bukkyö daijiten proposes another pronunciation, namely "Izana." This variant is interesting for our topic, as we will see later. At any rate, the twelve directional deities, among which figures īsāna seem rather close to the earthly plane (except for Brahmā "of the above"), so it appears understandable that Annen placed īsāna in the Realm of Desire. In the aforementioned Shittan zõ , Annens doctrine is even more complicated. He writes:52 There are three kinds of Mahesvara: the first is the sovereign of the Heaven of the Fourth Meditation, and he is called Pisāca; he is the great arrogant [deity] , sovereign of the Trichiliocosm. It is he who was subjugated by Fudõ [Myõõ] when the Buddha first attained enlightenment as it is taught in the Sūtra of the Diamond Sinciput. The second is the sovereign of the Heaven of the First Meditation, and he is named Samkara; the Commentary on the Mahāvairocana-sūtra writes that he has the great sovereign power over the single [chilio]cosm, but not in the Trichiliocosm. The third is the sovereign of the Sixth Heaven, and he is named īsāna; as seen in the Jingang shouming tuoluoni jing [&amp;H!l]Hfà[Ptïll/E]fê£, the Buddha, upon his descent from Mount Sumeru, ordered Trailokyavijaya to subjugate this deity along with his consort for they were obstinate and difficult to convert. Here, "Samkara" is yet another name for Siva-Mahesvara; it occurs much less frequently in the Chinese Buddhist Canon; the quotation from the Commentary 50. On this problem, see my "Le Roi Māra du Sixième Ciel et le mythe médiéval de la création du Japon," p. 336, pp. 339-340; "Dairokuten Maõ to chùsei Nihon no sõzõ shinwa," I, pp. 47-49. 5 1 .

In light of these passages, it is now possible to understand the curious name "Īsāna-Mahesvara of the Sixth Heaven, [that is] Pisāca-Mahesvara ( dairokuten no Izana-Makeshura, Bishaja-Makeishura II)" mentioned in the Tenchi Reikikis allusion to the myth of Māra of the Sixth Heaven who, "for a period of one hundred milliards of kalpas ," was "trembling and rum- bling in anger." But what is more important for our purpose is the central idea that Annen forwards in these passages: we notice a constant preoccupation with Buddhist cosmological doctrines, especially the beginning of a kalpa - or, more specifically, the creation of the world. This is particularly evident in the first chapter of the Shittan zõ which extensively deals with the question of cosmogony by addressing the different theories about the origins of writing. We read for example a quotation from Zhanrans Hongjue !&amp;$: commentary on the Mohe zhiguan JSIHlhlS:54 The Hongjue by Zhanran says: The king of Devas Mahābrahmā gave birth to Eight Devas sons; these Eight Devas sons gave birth to the beings of the Four clans (shishõ P3 [the four varņas ]), the ksatriyay the brāhmaņa , the vaiiya and the íüdra. This is why these Eight Devas sons are the fathers of all the beings. The original passage in the Zhiguan fuxingchuan hongjue ihłStBirflS3Łifc is of a particular interest55 since it is an indirect reference to the text of the Dazhidulun that was quoted in the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki. Another important doctrinal feature of the above selections from Annens works is a very clear inclination - especially apparent in the Kyõjigi and the Bodaishingi- shõ - towards ideas that would later form the core of medieval Tendai's "Original Enlightenment" thought ( hongaku shisõ In his discussion of subjugation theories in the Tantric sources of the Bodaishingi-shõ , Annen writes:56 Thus, the subjugation of Māra is different in each of the four grounds [Annen refers here to the theory of the four bodies of the Buddha corresponding to four "grounds"] . According to the Vimalakīrti [nirdeša sūtra] and others, it is said that the domain of Māra is thusness, and the domain of the Buddha is thusness; this is the subjugation of Māra on the ground of Self-Nature, by [the Buddha of] the Self-Nature Body. Here again, Annen's quotation of the Vimalakīrtinirdesa-sūtra contains an error; the phrase stating that "the domain of Māra is thusness, and the domain of 53.

On the ground of the Self-Nature [Body] , Māra is originally subjugated [this corresponds with the above doctrine, according to which the domain of Māra and that of the Buddha are equally "thusness"] ; on that of the Enjoyment Body, the Buddha first realizes the enlightenment and then subjugates [Māra] ; on the ground of the Transformation Body, he first subjugates [Māra] then realizes [enlightenment] ; on the ground of the Natural Outflow Body, he never realizes [enlightenment] and always subjugates [Māra]. The domain of Māra is thusness; that of the Buddha is thusness. There is unique thusness, and no two thusnesses. This is the True Thusness that subjugates Māra on the ground of the Self-Nature [Body] . In such a perspective, where all is simultaneously Buddha and Māra, where all opposites are dissolved in the Unique Thusness ( ichinyo ^#P), the mythical distinc- tion between Māra and Mahesvara is no longer of real importance. In the erroneous quotation of the Mahãyãna-avatãra-sãstra , Annen had replaced the "Mahesvara of the [Heaven] Suddhāvāsa," that is to say the bodhisattva of the tenth ground, with "Mahesvara-Pisāca," the demonic Mahesvara. That would imply that the bodhisattvas of the tenth ground are demonic beings. But if Māra is a bodhisattva "established in the inconceivable liberation" as stated in the Vimalakirtinirdesay then, this anomaly may be significant: all the subjugations that are narrated in different texts would simply be a play on transcendental powers, with the unique aim of converting the beings through skillful means - but in the ultimate truth, these beings are already converted and reside in the original and eternal nirvāna from the beginning. It is possible, in these conditions, that the "error" of Annen's quotation is perhaps a deliberate modification of the texťs original meaning. Such radical non-dualist metaphysics, characteristic of "Original Enlightenment" ideology, can lead toward a latent antinomianism in which the distinction between Good (the Buddha) and Evil (Māra, demonic beings) tends to "dissolve into the Unique Thusness." It is possible to suppose that such non-dualistic metaphysics was the underlying principle for the different versions of the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven that were narrated in the Middle Ages, and more generally, in sources of early medieval Shintõ thought. 57.

But since "the domain of Māra is thusness [and] that of the Buddha is thusness," Māra is identical with the Buddha himself. There is a passage in the Keiranshüyöshü which seems to draw this very conclusion, adding to it an interesting Shintõ development. In a discussion of the identity between the "Brilliant Deity" {shinmei #0^, that is Amaterasu) and the Buddha Mahāvairocana, the author explains:59 Moreover, our country is a divine country ( waga kuni wa shinkoku narif%M/sWWŮ i); if we seek its primordial deity (ganjin 7 tW)y it is Tenshõ daijin who is the same as Mahesvara. Now, the master of the Shingon teaching (. shingon kyõshu Älfifci) is also Maheśvara who realized the Path in the Akanistha Heaven [the pinnacle of the Form Realm] . This is why it is said that the Brilliant Deity is Mahāvairocana. A little further, the same text associates Mahesvara with Amaterasu more directly:60 At the time of our country's creation, Tenshõ daijin alone descended from the heaven. Her divine descendants gradually spread and filled up our country. There is no being, even ourselves, who is not her descendant. From the point of view of ritual (jisõ ni kore wo ronzureba the Brilliant Deity is truly our parent, [and we are her] grandchildren. Moreover, Mahesvara considers all the beings of the Three Planes as his own children, and pondering his role in fostering living beings, he [developed] compassion for them. [This is why] our Tenshõ daijin is Mahešvara [himself]. You should profoundly consider this. Such a direct association of Mahesvara with Mahāvairocana and/or Amaterasu is not habitual; a much more frequent association is the one between the Deva Brahmā and the primordial Shintõ god, Amaterasu or Ame no minakanushi no mikoto.61 Moreover, in the Ise Shintõ tradition, where the dual nature of the Outer Shrine (gekü and the Inner Shrine ( naikü ÑíS) is essential, this Brahma is divided into two Brahmas, Sikhin and Jyotisprabha (Shiki daibon P and Kõmyõ daibon This pair also appears in the introduction to the Lotus Sūtra (see above n. 5).

What is important to note here is that these "Two Great Imperial Deities" are "the primordial gods {ganjin 7É#) of the creation of Heaven and Earth" and there- fore, are "the Seat of the Master(s) of one Great Trichiliocosmos." This means that the said deities are the sovereigns of all the world; if one looks for such deities in Buddhist scriptures, it is not difficult to find them in the above mentioned passages from Annen's works.63 There are many early Shintõ texts that identify Shiki Daibon and Kõmyõ Dai- bon with Ame no minakanushi and/or Amaterasu.64 An interesting example can be found in one of the works belonging to the Reikiki cycle, the Isuzugawa Yamadahara Toyouke kõtaijin chinza shidai There, King Brahma Sikhin, associated with a water jewel (suiju zR^fć), is said to be Mahāvairocana of the Vajra Realm. He is also identified with Ame no minakanushi no mikoto and Toyouke kõtaijin on the other hand, King Brahmā Jyotisprabha, associ- ated with a fire jewel (kaju ^C^), is said to be Mahāvairocana of the Womb Realm. He is further identified with Ame no minakanushi, Tenshõ kõtaijin Paranirmita-vasavartin, and Mahesvara (Makeishura MIS If Si). The text continues:65 63. Annen's references to these deities usually occur in the context of citations from com- mentaries on the Lotus Sūtra. One of the most important of these was Jizang's commentary, quoted in the Kyõjigi: T. LXXV 2396: 435a26-b3; the passage in question is found in Jizang's commentary: T. XXXIV 1721: 464c2-25. I translate Annen's summary here: "According to the Sanlun HU school, it is said: The Suvraņaprabhāsa says that king Brahma [sovereign of] one hundred billion of [suns and moons] is king Brahma of the First Meditation [Heaven] . [This Heaven constitutes the] lowest category. The Daiahhūmika-sūtra says that Mahesvara sovereign of one Chiliocosm is king Brahmā of the Second Meditation [Heaven] ; this is the middle category. The Bodhisattva of the ninth ground becomes king Brahmā sovereign of two Chiliocosms. This is king Brahmā of the Third Meditation [Heaven] : it is the superior category. The sovereign of the Trichiliocosm resides at the center of one hundred billion suns and moons; it is the king Brahmā of the Fourth Meditation [Heaven] . It is the highest among superior categories." - Note the characteristic mention of the "one hundred billion suns and moons." 64. See relevant examples in Agatsuma Matashirõ, art. cit.

In one text associating King Brahma with Amaterasu (Tenshõ daijin the very peculiar Bikisho JIB® written by the Vinaya master Chien in 1324, we may find another clear reference to Annen. The Bikisho is a commen- tary on the various interpretations of "Tenshõ daijin"; these are divided into two main parts, the "intra-doctrinal" ( kyõnai ifcñ ) and "extra-doctrinal" ( kyõge The "intra-doctrinal" part is divided into two "meanings" (gi ü ) : the first "corre- sponds to what is explained in [texts] such as the Chronicle of Japan ( Nihonki 0 ;£fE)."66 This "probably refers to traditional myths and kami lineages."67 The sec- ond "meaning" is much more developed: it is "made clear by the two teachings of Sakyamuni and Mahāvairocana" (we should perhaps understand this as the exo- teric and esoteric teachings of Buddhism). This second "meaning" is sub-divided into five further "meanings," as Fabio Rambelli and Mark Teeuwen explain:68 In a Buddhist context, the divinity "Amaterasu" refers to the following [five "meanings"] : (i) Mahāvairocana of the two realms (ryõbu Dainichi ^pP^:0); (ii) Fudõ Myõõ and Aizen Myõõ; (iii) Mahābrahmā (Daibonten (iv) King Enma; and (v) Kõbõ Daishi. This series of associations is hierarchically structured, from the cosmic Buddha of esoteric Buddhism in its two fundamental modalities, to two of its more powerful emanations (Fudõ and Aizen), to the Deva king of the Realm of Forms, Brahmā, to the embodiment of negativity, King Enma, the ruler of hell and suffering, and finally to a human manifestation, Kõbõ Daishi. If we concentrate on the first part of the third of these different "meanings," namely the association of Amaterasu (including both the naikü and the gekü of the Shrine of Ise) with the Deva Mahābrahmā, we may turn our attention to the following excerpt:69 ...In the third place, we learn that [Amaterasu is associated with] Mahābrahmā.

As I have shown in a previous article,71 the curious theory that is recorded here about the origins of three kinds of scripts is certainly based on the introductory chapter of the Shittanzõ. We may note here again the loose identification of Māra of the Sixth Heaven with King Brahmā, who, in turn, is associated with the curious "Harama" (which could be pronounced "Barama" as well, since the voiced consonant was not noted in medieval Japanese) and Visņu. The following passage from the Shittanzõ contains what is probably the original source of the strange name "Harama:"72 In the Commentary to the Treatise on the Lotus Sütra ( Hokke-ron chü Jõtõ S il writes: At the beginning of the kalpa, Mahesvara had intercourse with Visņī (?

He had four faces and taught the four Vedas (shi Hada HiSPß); he also had another face on the top [of his head] , which taught another Veda. The four Vedas taught by the four faces are those of the Law of the World ( sebo ļĒīŽ, Sk. loka-dharma ?). The one taught by the face of the top is profound and difficult to understand. Only the four Vedas are current in the world... Jõtõ was a monk of the Hossõ school ÍÔÊth from the Nara period (741-815 [or 816]).

As we have already noted, īsāna is another of Siva's names, a special designation of his form as the guardian deity of the north-east in 71.

Thus, we may surmise that the work was written around the middle of the thirteenth century. The passage in question is found in the third fascicle of the work, which was considered lost until Abe Yasurõ reconstituted it from a very fragmented Daigoji manuscript in 1988. It is yet another version of the myth of King Māra, tentatively translated below:75 There is also a certain tradition which says that when our country did not yet exist, King Māra of the Sixth Heaven foresaw that on this island, the Buddha's Law would certainly spread; then, [he thought:] "There will be many people in this country who will leave my Realm and reach the land of the Unconditioned ( mui no tsuchi that is the nirvāna)" As he was grieving over this, the Tathāgata Mahāvairocana peered into King Māra's mind and realized that if King Māra, foreseeing the situation, would hinder [the creation of this country] , then it would be difficult for the Buddha's Law to spread. Having reflected on this, the Tathāgata transformed himself into a child of King Māra and became the sovereign of our country. He then uttered to King Māra: " [Oh Father,] do not be sad! I become this country's sovereign and in the future, I will make my progeny its kings. In this country, the Buddha's Law will be taboo, and if there are people who worship it, calamity will befall them so that the Buddha's Law will not spread." [On these words,] King Māra was satisfied, and leaving the country to his care, he ascended back to the Heaven. Afterwards, [... when the country was created] kings and ministers were all firm believers in the Law, and people had no wrong view. However, in worshiping at the Great Sanctuary [of Ise] , Shintõ [or the jindõ] is the principle [the text has a lacuna at this point, and the meaning is not clear] ( Daijingū o hõji hajime, mune tono jindõ 75.

This is because of the mind's fear of King Māra; [the Deity of the Great Sanctuary?] is mindful about its reputation. At the outset, it is because Mahāvairocana [in Japanese, Dainichi] bestowed his legacy of conversion [upon our country] ( he wo tare tamau that the country is called "Dainihon-koku" [The "Original Country of Dainichi," which means "Great Sun"] and its sovereign is named "Amaterasu oonkami" [or Tenshõ-daijin] ["Great Deity Shining in the Sky"] . The name "Amaterasu" [Shining in the Sky] appears to have the same meaning ( kokoro as Dainichi [Great Sun] . And [the meaning of] "Great Deity" (oonkami or daijin ;*:#) is no different from the meaning of "Great Enlightened One" (&lt; daikaku [another name for "Buddha"]). If we understand this and ponder the name of Amaterasu oonkami, are Izanagi and Izanami not the same as īsāna and his consort? īsāna is the name of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven. This matter is truly revealing; it is so gracious and wonderful. The fact that the Sanskrit name of King Māra and our ancient word [Izanagi] are no different, what a marvel this is! (fiishigi ni koso habere^Ffà ťayfiřu) This text is replete with interesting details. In this version of the myth of King Māra, the child into whom the Buddha Mahāvairocana transforms is very prob- ably Amaterasu herself; she does not fulfill the role of creator in a strict sense, but is said to be the "sovereign of this country" from the beginning. There is an unfortunate lacuna in the sentence explaining the taboo of Buddhist things at Ise shrine; since we find there the word "mune" ü, which may mean "principle," and the word "jindõ (or shintõ )" #*Ë, I have tentatively translated this as "in worshiping at the Great Sanctuary [of Ise], Shintõ [or the jindõ] is the principle", but this may be a misinterpretation. The last part of the text, in which the name of Mahāvairocana surprisingly coincides with that of Japan and Amaterasu, and the name of Izanagi coincides with that of Īsāna-Māra, may be considered as the conclusion to the passage. The matching of Mahāvairocanas name with "Japan" and "Amaterasu" recalls Seison's Shingonfuhõ sanyõ-shõ once more. The phrase " Dainichi no he wo taretamau" ;*;EI p7 translated as "Dainichi bestowed his legacy of conversion [upon our country]" can be understood as an allusion to the theory of honji suijaku ì&amp; (Original Ground, Left Trace), because we encounter the characteristic word " tareru , tarasu " - which is the Japanese reading of the character "suť S used in the compound "honji suijaku ." Thus, Amaterasu in a sense is the "Trace Left" by the "Original Ground," Mahāvairocana. Considering the "wonder," and the feel- ing of great "mystery" the author expresses when pointing out the coincidence of Izanagi's and īsāna's names, one might be inclined to think it was his first discovery of corresponding "sameness." For the author, it appears that the value of the passage lies in directly relating Japan to India, the transcendental homeland of the cosmic Buddha, through this correspondence in names. He probably did not pay much attention to the implication of this "sameness," namely that Izanami, the creator god of Japan would be identified with Māra, the enemy of Buddhism... The fact that Dõhõ identifies "King Māra of the Sixth Heaven" with īsāna appears to be founded on Annens classificatory scheme of Heavens, in which "īsāna- Mahesvara" is identified with "the sovereign of the Sixth Heaven" (see above, p. 280).</page><page sequence="28">290 Iyanaga Nobumi Moreover, in Annen's discussion on different accounts of the subjugation myth of hindering gods, we find two interesting passages which might have influenced this identification between Izanagi/Izanami and īsāna. In one long "question," Annen writes that according to some accounts of the subjugation myth, it is said that "Mahesvara, sovereign of the Three Realms (sangai tenshu was subdued together with his consort; that would mean that this Deva was married to a female. But since "the impurity of husband and wife" (fitfufujõ is limited to the Desire Realm, Annen asks whether this Deva is not the sovereign of the Desire Realm, that is "Mahesvara of the Sixth Heaven {dairokuten Makeishura MP)."76 Then, one page further in the Taishõ edition, Annen states that "according to the Shingon-shù, the wrathful body of īsāna is called Rudra; he is also named Mahesvara: it is King Māra of the Palace of the Sixth Heaven."77 - Combining these two passages, we may understand how for Annen, īsāna was considered a sexualized deity, associated with his female consort; īsāna was therefore identified with Māra at the pinnacle of the Desire Realm, since the latter was typically rep- resented as a god of love (Kama Deva). These characteristics fit particularly well with the Japanese creator gods, or rather "procreator" gods Izanagi and Izanami. H irata Atsutane and early medieval Shinto In the second section of the Marishiten yõki analyzed above, there is a curious passage which recounts the following: "The king of Devas Mahābrahmā, who is the sovereign of Trichiliocosm, and foremost the sovereign of the Saha World, is [also] the sovereign of the Fourth Meditation [Heaven] . He is Mahesvara-Mahābrahmā (Makeishura Daibon 0B11ÍÍI;*CÍE), father of all sentient beings."78 This "heretical" doctrine is well-known from the time of the Dîrghâgama (T. 1 1: 145al0-14) and can be found in a number of texts. But to name this deity "Mahesvara-Mahābrahmā" is extremely odd; there is no occurrence of such a name in the entire Taishõ. However, this anomaly can be explained in the following way: for Annen, deities are different only inasmuch as they manifest themselves in various dimensions of heavens; but in essence, they are all hindering powers of Buddhist Law, and, at the same time , identical with the Buddha in the ultimate truth. In this sense, the individuality of deities fuses into a unique cosmic force. 76. Kyõjigi, T.

As it can be expected from a nativist, Hirata was a decided critic of Buddhism. He began to study Buddhism around 1803, especially concentrating on the Shutsujõ kõgo ttíãííâip of Tominaga Nakamoto líácřťžÉ (1715-1 746) ;80 his first writing about Buddhism, entitled Butsudõ taii (or Shutsujõ shõgo was a transcription of a series of lectures he had delivered on Buddhism. He continued his study and also wrote several other books on the topic. The Indozõshi is the most important one among them: Hirata began to write it around 1820, but could not finish it until his death in 1843. Hiratas buddhology had a very peculiar feature: he began his study from read- ing Tominagas work, then some basic works such as the Hasshū kõyõ AtkÜS by Gyõnen (1240-1321) or the Genkõ shakusho by Kokan Shiren M (1278-1346); he continued the curriculum by picking up and reading by himself as many canonical Buddhist works as possible. He seems to have almost completely ignored Japanese Buddhist schools. This is probably related to the circulation of Buddhist texts in his time: the Ming edition of the Buddhist Canon was re-edited in Japan in the later seventeenth century as the Obaku edition and was rela- tively accessible in Hiratas time; but the works of Japanese schools were probably more difficult to obtain. It appears from Hiratas writings on Buddhism that he had no special interest in Japanese Buddhist doctrines, and did not take the trouble of reading them. This is a great weakness of his Buddhist learning. Nevertheless, it is certain that Hiratas works on Buddhism were the most significant, both in quantity and quality, of any composed by a non-Buddhist author before Meiji. Comparing his first work, the Butsudõ taii , with the Indo zõshiy we may notice an important difference. While the Butsudõ taii is a criticism of Buddhism from the first page to the last, in the Indo zõshi , Hirata attempts to prove the validity of his own ideas through the examination of Buddhist sources. The theory that he expounded was that Japanese mythology as he reconstituted it is the "universal truth"; in order to demonstrate this, he attempted to demonstrate that the same mythological principles were known by all the people of the world. In this context Hirata analyzed Buddhist literature in order to extract from it Indian myths, and compared them with Japanese ones. 79.

Honolulu: Uni- versity of Hawaii Press, 1990. - There exists a notebook of his studies on this topic, entitled "Shutsujõ shõgo genpon" edited in Hirata Atsutane zenshü 10, Tokyo, 1977.</page><page sequence="30">292 Iyanaga Nobumi For Hirata, theories and doctrines proper to Buddhism are of no intrinsic interest; in his thought, Buddhism is nothing other than a system of doctrines artificially forged by the Buddha Sakyamuni and his followers, and as such, it is something to reject. However, he finds in Buddhist literature several ancient traditions that their authors were unable to disguise. Thus, he proceeds to "excavate" from this mass of human production traces of genuine, authentic and natural (indigenous) mythology. The Indo zõshi is the end result of this effort in "textual archeology." The Indo zõshi consists of a considerable number of quotations from Buddhist materials. Because the authors interest is centered on the "ancient brahmanic tra- ditions" {bar amon no kosetsu he makes copious use of Āgama texts (whose antiquity was proven by Tominaga), but also historical data documented in Chinese pilgrims' records such as those of Xuanzang or Yijing. Hirata virtually ignores Mahâyana sùtras because for him, they contained nothing more than fabri- cated nonsense. Interestingly, however, he does attach great importance to esoteric texts. For example he writes the following:81 Magical spells and practices can be found in [a category of] works known as secret rituals ( himitsu giki i); most of these are presented as having been taught by the Buddhist Ancestor ( busso #&amp;Āiā; Hirata uses this expression to pejoratively designate the Buddha Sakyamuni), but they are all forged attributions; in fact, these were the practices of brâhmans and [alleged] "heretics" {kano gedõ 1) that [Buddhists] had stolen; there is no single practice that can be traced back to the Buddhist Ancestor. [...] Although it is difficult to find genuine traditions in the form that they were known in these rituals, there are still some scattered, yet interesting spells, amulets or practices that can be traced back to King Mahābrahmā or gods of other names. A text entitled "Ichiji shinju kyõ" contains a spell named "Spell in one word of the Great King turning the Wheel" which is almost certainly a true spell of the Great King Brahmā transmitted by the Deva Brahmā. Thus, for Hirata, the significance of esoteric Buddhism rested in the fact that it was not really "Buddhist." Another expression of this idea can be found in a passage in which Hirata deals with the esoteric work entitled "Kuyöjüni daiitoku ten hõon-bon " (T. XXI 1297, that he designates by the title "Jūniten senki He writes:82 At the beginning, [this work] is entitled "Kuyõ jüni daiitoku ten hõon-bon" and at the end, it is named "Jūniten senki " -hn^üfi It is a translation by the tripitaka Amoghavajra of the Tang. Upon reading it, one can discern that it is an ancient book authored by brâhmans, but it was rewritten in a Buddhist tone as if it had been taught by the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra with the accord of the Buddhist Ancestor. Although this is clear for those who read it with a critical eye ( katsugan féî II), let me say that the Buddhist Ancestor usually despises King Brahmā and refutes the old tradition, stating that 'the creation of this world is not something of which he [that is, 81. Zenshüy XI, pp.65b-66a, pp.67b-68a. 82. Ibid., XI, p. 62a.</page><page sequence="31">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 293 King Brahma] would be capable of.'83 But the sentence that I quote here is contrary to this.84 From this single example, we can deduce everything... From the historical point of view, it is true that esoteric Buddhist doctrines are often very different from classical Buddhist theories, and in many cases, they are closer to Brahmanic or Hindu thought. Hirata quotes many "creationist" myths from the Buddhist Canon and associates them with Japanese mythology85. The most frequently mentioned deity in the first eight scrolls of the Indo zõshi is probably the Deva Brahma, whom Hirata terms "the heavenly deity Mahābrahmā-īsvara (Dai- bon Jizai tenjin ^CÍEÊIÍE;^#)." For the nativist, the name of the supreme creator god, whether it is Brahmā, Mahesvara or Visņu, does not matter much. The first scroll of his work contains many of these cosmogonie myths of Brahmanic origin (pp. 9b- 16a). To introduce them, Hirata presents beforehand a synthetic summary in the following terms (p. 9b) : To understand this [the origins of brāhmans] , we must first inquire about the ancient traditions of their country [India] , namely those related to King Mahābrahmā. First of all, to expound their general outline, [it is said that in the beginning] there was a [single] deity-world ( tenkai ^l?-) in empty space, without beginning or end, named either Deva Mahābrahmā, Brahmā-īsvara (Bon-Jizaiten or Mahesvara (Daijizaiten In that world, there existed a heavenly deity of great sovereignty ( daishusai no tenjin called either King Mahābrahmā, Nārāyaņa or Mahesvara (Makeishura-ten 0 who was also without beginning or end. He produced existence from nothing, and produced this world. Therefore, it is told that he is the Ancestor Deity (. sojin Ü#) who created not only humans, but all the beings in the world by transformation ( keshõ seru ib£-tź*£). The nature of this "King Mahābrahmā" is only revealed in the eighth scroll. Hirata writes (pp. 272b-273b) (in the following translation, sentences between the braces "{" and "}" are notes by Hirata himself) : Now, what do people think of the heavenly deity by the name of Mahābrahmā-īšvara? He is nothing more than a [god of] the ancient tradition which confounded in a single [deity] myths narrating [the exploits of] the imperial ancestor of the [Japanese] emperor (sumeragi no mi-oya ^JĒOJĒĀfi), [that is] the Great Deity Musuhi /Ü!!^#86 83. See the Dīrghāgama, T. I 1: 69b21-22: 84. Hirata cites the following passage from the Kuyöjüni daiitoku ten hõon-bony T. XXI 1297: 384a21-23: "The Deva Brahma is the sovereign of Upper Heavens; he is the father of sentient beings. When this Deva is pleased, the entire Receptacle World is calm and without trouble. Why? This is because at the beginning of the kalpa, this Deva realized the Receptacle World." 85. Although he does not quote the Dazhidulun passage that was used in the beginning of the Yamato Katsuragi hõzanki , he cites other versions of the same myth several times; these are found in the Zapiyujing (see above, n. 5), the Waidao xiaocheng niepanlun and the Zhongguan lun shu (see above, n. 7): see Indo zõshi. Zenshū , 11, p. 10b, 15b, 45b, 59b, etc. 86. The word "musuhi" (noted with various kanji such as MiHEI, i0 or ËL%1) is com- posed of two elements, "musu" meaning "generate, procreate" and " hi" (which can be pronounced " bi " as well) meaning "spiritual" or "mysterious power." At the beginning of the Kojiki , there is a list of three cosmogonie deities, Ame no minakanushi, Takami-musuhi (or musubi) MļHĒH</page><page sequence="32">294 Iyanaga Nobumi and the Great Deity Izanagi. This can be deduced from the fact that according to that tradition, that deity created Heaven and Earth and all things. [In Japanese tradition, it is said that] when Heaven and Earth first came to be separated, the Great Deity Musuhi created the one thing whose form is difficult to be expressed {sono katachi iigataki ichimotsu Äfeiälfü#- 1 ^).87 {Pondering the form of this "thing," I believe it is of female reproductive organs. This is why it is said that its form cannot be expressed. I developed this point in my Koshi-den .88 Thus, this should be named "the dark female {genpin )."} This deity bestowed a heavenly pike with jade ornament (ame no nuhoko ) on the two deities Izanagi and Izanami and ordered them to stir this thing whose form could not be expressed; when they withdrew the pike a drop trickled down the tip of the pike and created the island Onogoro . They then descended on this island, and having generated a [common] thought, they set up for the first time the path of husband and wife (fūfu no michi o okoshi coílÝP* L ) and they produced all eighty kingdoms in [our] country and the myriad things, including the green human grass (ao-hito-kusa ļfA^). [...] Moreover, [they] stuck the august pike in the ground of Onogoro island, and made it the august pillar of the center of the country ( kuni-naka no mi-hashira )• This pillar later became a hill; looking at its true form, it looks very much like what is called the heavenly root (tenkon [i.e. the divine phallus or linga]). This is not without reason, for it is clear that the bestowed pike with jade ornaments was a thing of that kind. [...] The passage from the commentary on the Madhyamakaíãstra that I quoted in a previous chapter on the topic of Four Castes, states: "the Deva Visņu grasped a disk-halberd ( ringeki tfc), and has a great power. All beings came to be born from it."89 This is also related to the august pike, and we should reflect on this [correspondence] too. {As I have already explained in detail, Visņu is another name for Mahesvara.90 In the sentence "All beings came to be born from it," "it" seems to indicate Visņu, but if we consider the matter it is clear that "it" indicates the halberd.} Here, Hirata slyly attempts to establish an equivalence between Mahābrahmā- īsvara, the Great Deity of Musuhi, and the Great Deity Izanagi. But a few pages further, he postulates more clearly that "the Deva Mahābrahmā-īsvara is the Great Deity of Kami-musuhi (pp.279b-280b). Thus, it can be said with relative certainty that in Hiratas theology, there existed the following scheme: and Kami-musuhi (or musubi) These are the most abstract deities of classical Japanese mythology; they are without sexual character, but in some cases, Kami-musuhi has feminine features. In Edo period nativist ideology, these deities were considered as the supreme/ primordial gods of Japan. 87. The beginning of the Nihon shoki B^INS (NKBT 67, p. 76 [77]) notes that according to one record ( issho "when Heaven and Earth first came to be separated, there existed one thing in the emptiness of space. Its form was difficult to express. In it, there was a self-generated deity: it was called Kuni-tokotachi no mikoto 88. Koshi-den is the main work by Hirata; it is a commentary to his own version of Japanese mythology. See Zenshüy I (Tõkyõ, 1977), pp. 119-b-120a (but here, Hirata says that this "thing whose form was difficult to describe" represents sexual intercourse between male and female (which he equates more directly to female genitalia on p. 170a). 89. Zhongguan lun shu T. XLII 1824: 14cl5-16: This passage is quoted in the Indo-zõshi p. 12b. 90. See for example Indo zõshi, pp. lib- 12b.</page><page sequence="33">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 295 i - Takami-musuhi (identified with Mahābrahmā-īsvara) Ame no minakanushi no kami - ' - Kami-musuhi (identified with Mahābrahmā-īsvara) It is astonishing to notice the similarity between this scheme and the theological structure of some of the early medieval Shinto texts that we have seen. Consider for example that of the Sengū himony which could be represented as follows (see above, p. 285): ( gekü ) Toyouke kõtaijin = Ame no minakanushi no kami = Emperor Mahābrahmā Sikhin (naikü) Tenshõ kõtaijin = Tenshõ daijin = Emperor Mahābrahmā Jyotisprabha Or perhaps the theological structure of the Toyouke kõtaijin chinza shidai is even closer to Hiratas scheme (see above, pp. 285-286): King Brahma Sikhin (associated with a jewel of water) = Mahāvairocana of the Vajra Realm = Ame no minakanushi no mikoto = Toyouke kõtaijin (male) King Brahmā Jyotisprabha (associated with a jewel of fire) = Mahāvairocana of the Womb Realm = Ame no minakanushi = Tenshõ kõtaijin (female)91 From what we have seen above, the notion of "Shintõ as a form of 'Japanese Hinduism/" which at first appears very odd, may now sound more appropriate: to clearly outline the logic behind this statement, let us recapitulate: 1 . Hirata Atsutane extracted Indian myths - and especially Indian cosmogonie myths - from Buddhist texts, and postulated that they are essentially the same as Japanese myths; 2. He also thought that Buddhist esoteric texts are only superficially "Bud- dhist" while their actual contents are not different from those of Indian mythical thought; 3. Early medieval Shintõ thought can be understood as an attempt to reinterpret Japanese deities and related myths (especially those of the Outer and Inner shrines of Ise) by using the structural patterns of esoteric Buddhist thought. The chief concern of early medieval Shintõ is cosmogony. 4. If it is true, as Hirata believes, that the esoteric Buddhist structural patterns that were used as the basic interprative grid in medieval Shintõ thought were only superficially Buddhist, and that they essentially belonged to Brahmanic or Hindu thought, the statement that "medieval Shintõ was a form of 'Japanese Hinduism'" would not be nonsensical. 91. Note that for Hirata, Ame no minakanushi is the supreme deity who has no attributes and is almost completely inactive (except his "quiescent" generating power) ( Indo zõshi , p. 277b); in this sense, this deity is beyond the actual action of creation. In these conditions, it is possible to think that Ame no minakanushi of the Toyouke kõtaijin chinza shidai is equivalent to the two "musuhi" deities of Hiratas theology.</page><page sequence="34">296 Iyanaga Nobumi If we consider the issue under this light, the surprising similarity between some forms of early medieval Shinto theology and Hiratas views from the Indo zõshi (similarity which is very likely the result of a pure coincidence92) would be of considerable significance. What was at stake in both medieval Shintõ theology and Hiratas thought was the absolute origin of the world; for this purpose, they both sought to investigate the most abstract deity (or deities) in Japanese mythology. It was thus a logical consequence that Ame no minakanushi (in the thought of both of them) and the "Musuhi" deities (in Hiratas theology) were considered as the highest gods. Early medieval Shintõ authors looked for these cosmogonie myths in Buddhist texts because they were under profound Buddhist influence; in Hiratas case, it was because he wanted to find proof of his theories in Indian mythology that he investigated Buddhist texts. Conclusion At the end of this study, I would like to present a larger vision that could serve as the background for all the developments that we have examined so far. In India, from the seventh or eighth century onward, a very important religious upheaval occurred; this "Tantric revolution" was a transformation that concerned all the major Indian religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. Until recently, this movement was explained by theories invoking, for example, a rise of Dravidian irrationality at the expense of "âryan" rationalism; Buddhism, considered as a rather "rational" religion, would have been submerged by the Tantric Hindu flood. But such theories have become objects of criticism and other types of expla- nations have been proposed. I personally think that one of the main drives which led to the "Tantric revolution" of Indian religion was an internal movement within Buddhism itself:93 from the time of the early Mahãyãna, Buddhism developed a kind of paradoxical logic, such as the one represented by the phrase "Form is nothing other than Emptiness." The mechanics of this logic could lead to the reversal of socially received values, producing concepts including "defilement is identical with enlightenment" or "samsara is identical with nirvāna ." Along the same lines, there were also more markedly "Tantric notions" expressed in maxims like "Great anger subjugates ordinary anger," "Great craving cures ordinary craving" or even "since everything is equally Thusness (or Emptiness) in ultimate truth, one should not fear that which is considered 'evil' or 'impure/" This kind of reasoning could be very similar to a certain Saiva philosophy and practice by which one sought "the impure 92. Hiratas theory is so similar to medieval Shinto thought that we could doubt as to some cryptic influence of the latter on him, even though he is ostensibly against medieval Shinto. But even if it is true that he read some medieval Shinto texts (see Mori Mizue "Kinsei ni okeru Reikiki" in Köchü kaisetsu gendaigo yaku Reikiki , pp. 528-536), he seems to have almost not known at all its theory about Mahābrahmā. 93. On what follows in the text, see my "Tantrism and Reactionary Ideology in Eastern Asia: Some Hypothesis and Questions," Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie 13, pp. 20-22.</page><page sequence="35">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 297 in order to attain ultimate purity." The rise of this ontological tendency, which could be labeled both Buddhist and Saiva at the same time, along with the fall of the Gupta dynasty and the emergence of small military states that were constantly at war with each other, set the stage for the development of Tantric currents in all Indian religions.94 It would appear that the "tantricization" of Indian religion was triggered by the mutual stimulation of radical elements in Buddhist and Saiva movements. As a consequence of this evolution, Buddhism was submerged in a new Hindu religiosity that was to a great extent the result of its own transformation. In this sense, one could forward the hypothesis that the disappearance of Bud- dhism in India was caused by the traditions "self-implosion" or internal auto-collapse. One could also propose that a similar process occurred in Japanese Buddhism during the Middle Ages, resulting, notably, in the advent of medieval Shinto. Among the different causes for the "implosion" of Japanese Buddhism, we may cite esoteric trends, especially "Original Enlightenment thought," of which Annen was one of the most far-reaching founders. It seems that the brand of Buddhism conceived by his successors was almost no different from a kind of theism or panthe- ism; in this context, we may understand how the Buddha Mahāvairocana, Tenshõ daijin, and the Deva Mahesvara for example, were considered manifestations of the same fundamental and supreme deity at different levels of truth (this was what was stated in the passage from the Keiranshüyöshü above, p. 284). In this line of thought, we may also comprehend how the opposition between "the universal" ( hon #) and "the particular" (jaku S) was dissolved by an identity (soku SP), and "the particular" was put above "the universal" in the ontological hierarchy. The idea of "Japan as the original country of the Buddha Mahāvairocana" is an example of the dissolution of opposition between "the particular" ("Japan" in this case) and "the universal" ("the Buddha Mahāvairocana"); the reverse notion that "the kami is the Original, the Buddha is the Trace" (jin-pon butsu-jaku #^{#I1) is an expression of the posi- tion of "the particular" above "the universal.". From this perspective, it is natural that individual deities (even King Māra of the Sixth Heaven, who is the enemy of Buddhism par excellence) are considered aspects of a vaguely defined universal- ity of absolute divine power. Thus, the demonic Siva (the "Pisāca-Mahesvara" of the Mahãyãna-avatãra-sãstra ), "the king Deva of the Fourth Meditation Heaven" (the Mahesvara identified with the bodhisattva of the tenth ground), and even "Vairocana-Mahesvara" (the name of a deity in the Rishu Makaen [see above, p. 279]) are the same in essence. In its true form, the universal and absolute divine power is represented as the Buddha Mahāvairocana, but in mundane reality, it necessarily manifests itself in different particular deities; and these deities take the appearance of awesome, awful, and amazing magical power. Early medieval Shintõ - or rather "jindõ" - is constituted of such deities. Thus, when the logical structure of Buddhist philosophy was "diluted" by the massive introduction of "Original Enlightenment thought," what resulted was a 94. On this point, see Ronald Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism : A Social History of the Tantric Movement, New York: Columbia University Press, 2003.</page><page sequence="36">298 Iyanaga Nobumi movement of "poetisation" of the world, by which mythical images from Buddhist, Japanese, or even Daoist (and Onmyõdõ) mythologies were freely combined, in order to create a new mythical representation of the world. What is known today as "early medieval Shintõ" could have been one product of this movement; and the astonishing development of esoteric rituals from the Insei period onward could have been another. The world after the Insei period, in which more and more sub-lineages of esoteric branches were created, was a world where everybody could be at the highest level of intellectual production, and full of intellectual stimulation. At the same time, it was a world in which the foundation of authority and sacredness of the ancient world was in ruin, and each person had to be confronted with a profound existential crisis. We can imagine that the number of people constituting a blood-lineage or a trend generally was very limited; and in many of these small groups, seeds of new, bold ideas could be generated (in the modern world, they could have become the core of what is usually called "new religions"). In this rich environment of intellectual ferment, new movements of esoteric thought that would later evolve into medieval Shintõ were born. Revolutionary ideas spread through texts, on the one hand in the aristocratic milieu, and on the other hand in that of shrine priests, giving birth to successive layers of new systems. A good example of this phenomenon can be found in the extraordinary development given to the ideas expressed in the short text by Seison: not only did they give birth to the notion of "Japan as the Original country of the Buddha Mahāvairocana," they were also the basis on which the myth of King Māra of the Sixth Heaven was founded. This text served also as a "filter" through which older texts, such as those of Annen, or even more classical texts such as the Dazhidulun or Chinese commentaries on the Lotus sūtra, could be examined again, providing"seeds" for other new mythical speculations. It is thus possible to think of Tantric Buddhism as a "specifically Hindu form of Buddhism" - and conceive of Hinduism (or perhaps a certain, "tantricized" form of Hinduism) much in the same way, as a "specifically Hindu form of Buddhism." On the other hand, early medieval Shintõ may also be understood as a "specifically Japanese (or 'Japanized'?) interpretation of (Japanese) Tantric Buddhism." If we were to combine these statements, would it not be possible to think of Japanese medieval Shintõ as "a form of 'Japanese Hinduism'"? Hinduism and Shintõ (or classical Japanese mythology) seem to share the label of "indigenous religion." But this "indigenousness" is itself a constantly re-invented ideology; there is no "essential indigenousness." The expression "indigenous religion" reminds us of another word, "paganism." It would be interesting to compare early medieval Shintõ with the "neo-pagan" movement of our time: like early medieval Shintõ, neo-paganism would have evoked feelings of suspicion (at least for people of traditional learning) or renewal, and a certain intellectual thrill as well. Early "medieval Shintõ as a form of 'Japanese Hinduism' " could also be a kind of "neo- paganism" of the early medieval period... To conclude this essay, I would like to present some questions and issues that might profitably be pursued in the future. As we have seen above, there existed rather obvious connections between Annen and Seison, and between Seison and</page><page sequence="37">Medieval Shintõ as a Form of 'Japanese Hinduism ' 299 early medieval Shintõ thought, or more directly, between Annen and early medieval Shintõ thought. However, Annen's death came at the end of the ninth century, while Seison's activity ceased in the later half of the eleventh century, and early medieval Shintõ texts only emerged during the later part of the twelfth century. The chronological gaps between these events have yet to be filled, but due to the paucity of data, it has proven to be a difficult undertaking. Another important issue is that of when and how the people who were producing early medieval Shintõ discourse became (or did not become) aware of the fact that their doctrines were not really "Buddhist." It is my suspicion that many of them were Buddhist monks, more or less sincere believers that were well-acquainted with the materials of their tradition. Any novice with a minimum amount of exegetical training would know that Buddhism always opposed the notion of creationism.95 Were they ever aware of the discrepancy between their novel theology and the old tenets of Buddhism? If so, how did they attempt to reconcile this difference? Finally, and related to this question, it would be interesting to obtain more insight about the relationship between medieval Shintõ thought and what could be termed "heresies." In the Kõya monogatari that we have quoted above, there are a few interesting lines about the ethical issues surrounding "shintõ" (or jindo) deities and practices. The Kõya monogatari presents itself as a dialogue between a "boy" (shõdõ who raises questions, and an "old monk" ( rõsõ ÍHÜ), who answers them. In one exchange, the "boy" says:96 "Incidentally, I have another doubt and would like to ask you a question about it. I heard that the Original Grounds of the bright deities ( shinmei of our country are indeed buddhas and bodhisattvas. Now, [I know that] the buddhas' and bodhisattvas' mind is full of compassion. They bestow blessings to men, and do not harm them. But when I observe our country's bright deities, they often possess male and female shrine servants, and if one worships them, they kill people or harm things. On the other hand, while Buddhist Law does not abhor ( imi haberanu the impurity [related to] birth and death, I often hear that if they [the Japanese kamis] come to be in contact with it, [they] lay a curse ( tatari o nashi 9 &gt; and harm people. Moreover, it often happens that vile men and women are said to be possessed by them and act variously like insane people. All this is far from what one would expect of Buddhist behavior. While [the buddhas and the bodhisattvas that are their] Original Grounds are such Great Saints (daishõ Ali), why are the Traces so shallow and why do they cause people misfortune? This is what I wonder..." 95. This is true even in esotericism: see for example the Mahāvairocana sūtra or the Jū-jūshin ron T. XVIII 848 i 2a29; T. XXXIX 1796 i 593al3-25; T. 2217 676a26-b27; T.

The "old monk" answers this question by putting forward the argument of "wakõ dõjin" tfãit mm. He explains that this is similar to four kinds of esoteric rituals, among which the subjugation rituals are intended to harm people - but these are intended as a kind of skillful means to incite "foolish, ordinary people" to believe in Buddhism.97 Whether this explanation is convincing or not does not matter much. What is important here is that as early as the mid-thirteenth century, kami worship could be felt as something different from normal Buddhist practice. Thus, I believe that it is possible to understand early medieval Shintõ cults and theories as something other than entirely "orthodox." It would be interesting to further investigate this issue. 97.
