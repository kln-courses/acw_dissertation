The size and quality of the sample allow the dataset to be approached quantitatively, to determine both normative and anomalous funerary practices, and to detect distinct patterns of burial treatment for different segments of the population represented in the cemetery. Despite the small size of the community (ca 100-130 people), the results suggest a rather complex picture, in which the choice of specific burial containers, the relative wealth of grave assemblages and the selection of particular sets of items were dependent on differences in the age, gender, occupation and achieved status of the deceased. Comparison with other contemporary funerary assemblages helps to place Demircihöyük-Sarıket and these community-scale observations within their wider cultural context in central Anatolia. Özet Bu makale, Anadolu'da bugüne kadar yayınlanan en büyük Erken Tunç Çağı mezar verilerine sahip olan Demircihöyük Sarıket mezarlığına ait bir analiz üzerinde durmaktadır. Demircihöyük-Sarıket örneğinin boyutu ve kalitesi, bilinen ve alışılmışın dışında olan ölü gömme uygulamalarını belirlemek ve mezarlıkta temsil edilen toplumun farklı kesimleri için gömme yöntemlerindeki farklı kalıpları tespit etmek için bu verilere niceliksel bir yaklaşıma izin vermektedir. Topluluğun küçük boyutuna rağmen (yaklaşık 100-130 kişi), belirli mezar yapılarının tercih edilmesi, mezar buluntularının birbirinden farklılık gösteren zenginlikleri ve ölen kişinin yaşı, cinsiyeti, mesleği ve statüsüne göre mezara konulacak malzemenin seçilmesi gibi ulaşılan sonuçlar, oldukça karmaşık bir tablo ortaya koymaktadır. Çağdaşı olan diğer mezar topluluklarıyla karşılaştırılması, Demircihöyük-Sarıket ve bu toplum-ölçekli örnekleri Orta Anadolu'nun daha geniş kültürel bağlamı içinde yerleştirmeye yardımcı olmaktadır. Since the investigation of the Alacahöyük 'royal' cemetery in the early 1930s (Koşay 1937), a substan tial number of Early Bronze Age (henceforward EBA) funerary contexts in western and central Anatolia has been unearthed. This trend has intensified particularly in the last 30 years, when large burial datasets have been excavated with modern excavation techniques; Demircihöyük Sarıket, Küçükhöyük, Bakla Tepe, Harmanören/Göndürle, İkiztepe and Resuloğlu are only the best-known examples (Alkım et al. 1988; 2003; Gürkan, Seeher 1991; Seeher 2000; Özsait 2003; Yıldırım 2006; Şahoğlu forthcoming). Despite this wealth of data, surprisingly little research has been done to incorporate the available evidence into a coherent framework of analysis (for recent critique on the topic, cf. Zimmermann 2008: 509-10; Bachhuber 2008: 3-18). Apart from sporadic early research that was focused on a very limited number of contexts (Özgüç 1948; Battel 1974; Stech-Wheeler 1974), only recently has there been an effort to offer synthetic reassessments of EBA burial practices in western and central Anatolia (Uhri 2010; Massa, Şahoğlu 2011; forthcoming). However, over four decades of research elsewhere have shown that detailed analysis of funerary data is an essential tool in understanding the social organisation of past communities. Archaeological and ethnographic research indicate that there are systematic relationships between the overall configuration and complexity of funerary practices and the configuration and complexity of the society at large, 73</page><page sequence="2">Anatolian Studies 2014 and that the treatment of the deceased is consistent with the social roles they played in life (Binford 1971; Saxe 1971; O'Shea 1996; Parker Pearson 1999). In particular, the society of the dead can be simpler, but inherently not more complex than the society of the living since it cannot generate traits or categories that are unknown to its community (Morris 1987: 138). When analysing funerary data, three main caveats arise. First, the archaeological record is by nature incomplete and, in particular, items of perishable materials (for example flowers, basketry, wood, clothing, small bone implements, unbaked clay) are generally invisible to the analyst but might have been present to some degree in the archaeological context. Second, our ability to perceive meaning in the visible patterns is limited at a deeper cultural level, since past societies may have held systems of value that we are not necessarily able to recognise (Voutsaki 1993: 24). Third, the burial ceremony is often an arena for the living to readjust the social ties that have been altered by the death of a society member and the result of the needs of the mourners as much as of the position of the deceased in life (Pearson 1998: 33; Parker Pearson 1999; Iacono 2010: 82 83). While these biases are unavoidable, recognising them is the first step in reducing their impact on any interpretative model. The use of a multi-scalar approach, where at each scale of analysis (the grave, the cemetery, the site, contem porary sites in the region) data are correlated and compared within their context in order to confirm and strengthen observed patterns, is a further step towards increasing the accuracy of the model (O'Shea 1996; Iacono 2010). The aim of this paper is to apply this conceptual framework to the necropolis of Demircihöyük-Sarıket (Eskişehir), a site which has produced one of the largest and best-documented sets of funerary evidence for EBA Anatolia (Seeher 2000) and one of the few burial grounds whose settlement has also been thoroughly excavated and extensively published (Korfmann 1983; 1987; Seeher 1987; Kull 1988; Efe 1988; Baykal-Seeher, Obladen Kauder 1996). The level of detail attained by the investi gation of both funerary and domestic contexts at Demircihöyük thus offers the ideal case study to attempt an in-depth analysis of the social organisation of a small EBA hamlet and to highlight broad patterns of burial practices at the site. Simple statistical analyses have been employed to formalise differences in the record, to determine normative and anomalous behaviours and to evaluate patterns of horizontal and vertical differentiation within the graveyard, in line with previous studies on prehistoric southeastern Europe (Shennan 1975; O'Shea 1996; Rega 1997; Stratton, Boric 2012). The results of the intra-site analysis have, in tum, been contextualised within the panorama of western and central Anatolian funerary traditions of the third millennium BC. Such an exercise has rarely been attempted for prehis toric Anatolia, and the broader goal of this article is therefore to show that a quantitative and comparative approach can indeed considerably improve our under standing of the social dynamics of past communities. In this light, the results presented in this article seem to complement and further elaborate on Seeher's (2000) high-profile publication of the cemetery, the focus of which is to provide typological and chronological parallels for pottery and other find categories and to integrate the excavation data with supplementary analyses on geophysics, metallurgy and physical anthropology, rather than an analytical approach to social organisation. As such, despite some comments on the possible dynamics of the Demircihöyük community, he did not perform quantitative or comparative analyses on the dataset and so does not put forward conclusive hypotheses on the possible social differences within the settlement, which he perceives essentially as an undifferentiated community (Seeher 2000: 221-22). The archaeological background Demircihöyük lies at the western fringes of the central Anatolian plateau at one of the narrowest points of the Eskişehir valley (figs 1 and 2) on a major natural route connecting the central plateau with the Sea of Marmara (Efe 2007). The fortified site may possibly have exercised some form of control over access to the plain, but it should be noted that it is also one of the smallest investigated mounds of the EBA (originally 70m in diameter or ca 0.35ha); the majority of nearby settlements known from survey range from lha to 3ha and a few major EBA sites reach 5ha to 15ha (Efe 1990; 1995). The southern fringes of the settlement have been destroyed by the construction of a road in recent times and phases K—P in the western part of the excavated area have been severely eroded, as well as significantly disturbed by later Middle Bronze Age activity. As a result, a full picture of the settlement contem porary with the necropolis is unavailable. Nonetheless, the preserved middle EBA II houses were rebuilt on the foun dations of previous structures, and the whole settlement maintained an astonishing architectural continuity throughout its occupation (Korfmann 1983: 242); thus we may rely, if tentatively, on the early EBA II (phase H) architectural plans to infer some general data (fig. 3). The settlement has a peculiar radial plan with aggluti nated megaroid houses opening onto a central yard that hosted a series of underground silos for cereal storage. The backs of the buildings abut the defensive wall. This wall was up to 2m thick and 7m high at some points, and possibly surrounded by a ditch and interrupted by entrance gates. Twelve houses are known from excavation, and the peculiar radial plan allows us to reconstruct the unexca 74</page><page sequence="3">Massa Horoztcpe Hacılartçne/ • Ilıpıııar Aktoprı -«Küçük Höyük* • Demirdlıövük Kumtepe Alişar* Höyük'1 Bahaköy Bergama • # • Yortan Ballıca * ^ Linıaıı liluc^k^^V^J Tepe* * Höyük, (^avurtenc Kusu Bakla Tepe* &lt; 0 „ ?, 1 , Bcycesultaıı Kphesus . ™kjL il Gordion KUllüoba Çavdarlı • Hni Kiiltepı 4# i Aeemhövü «•V Aphrodisiqs Gcdiklt Höviik Konya j ırahöyük Miletus Karata» Jsnf ir Tarsus llaeftn Fig. I.

Skeletal remains of numerous foeti and newborns were found in the settlement, without any indication that they were accorded a formal burial and without accompanying grave goods (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 262). The study of the pottery provides secure chronological parallels with Troy: phases D-P run parallel to Troy I and phase Q is contemporary to Troy IIa (Seeher 1987; Efe 1988). A set of 64 short- and long-lived radiocarbon samples coming from phases Ei, E2, Fı, H, K2, L and M was analysed, and produced a sequence very tightly dated from 2850 to 2630 cal. BC (Weninger 1987; Manning 1995: 156). In order to estimate approximately the date of the phases not covered by the radiocarbon samples, a simple calculation can be performed: 230 years of occu pation spread across 12 architectural reconstructions (from Ei to M) = approximately 20 years per phase, with the end of the occupation of Demircihöyük (phase Q) somewhere around 2550 BC and an overall span of EBA settlement occupation of ca 300 years from phase D to phase Q (table 1). During the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age, the surrounding plain and the slopes of the mound were reoccupied, as witnessed by the presence of contemporary graves at Sänket (Kull 1988). The Late Iron Age (fourth-century BC) phase is only attested in the cemetery (Seeher 2000: 10). The cemetery of Demircihöyük-Sarıket is located on the slope of a nearby hill overlooking the settlement mound, roughly 370m southwest of it (fig. 4). The excava tions have brought to light some 500 Early Bronze Age tombs, ca 80 Middle Bronze Age burials, two Late Iron Age tumuli and 25 Late Iron Age graves. The magnetic prospec tion which first identified most of the tombs also suggests that the excavation trenches uncovered the great majority of the surviving burial area (Jansen 2000: 13). However, the excavator points out that recent agricultural activities and natural erosion may have obliterated as much as the top 50-60cm of the ancient soil surface in the western and highest portion of the cemetery, with the loss of an unde termined number of burials (Seeher 2000: 7). The size of this burial dataset, at present one of the largest for EBA Anatolia, should not induce the belief that the cemetery itself was larger than any of its contemporary counterparts. In fact, with a size of 0.2ha, it seems rather small when compared to necropoleis like those of Harmanören (approximately 4ha) and Karataş (at least 2ha); these would probably yield several thousand graves if fully excavated (Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming). The Sänket necropolis, with more than 300 complete vessels and pithoi, can be directly linked to the settlement sequence and belongs to phases K/L-Q (Seeher 2000: 32-46), ca 2700-2550 BC. Only the Early Bronze Age interments will be investigated here, but it is worth mentioning that despite a gap of over 800-900 years between the EBA II and the MBA use of the necropolis, the overall grave types and burial assem blages are strikingly similar (see discussion below). Analytical methodology The analyses presented below incorporate simple statistical methods that have been employed to investigate the corre lation between different categories of data and to test the significance of these associations. Association between variables has been assessed through simple frequency analysis, with the strength of correlation expressed as a percentage of the total of the sample (for example 'weapons are present in 12% of the total adult male graves'). More sophisticated measures of correlation, such as phi or Cramer's V, have not been employed in order to simplify the readability of the results. One- and two-sample chi square tests have been used to assess the statistical signifi cance of the analytical outcomes, by comparing the observed pattern with one that would be expected in a random distribution.

For example, p value&lt;0.001 means one chance out of 1,000 to be a product of randomness (Shennan 1997: 104-20). Throughout the analytical section, information about sample size, the variables involved and the p-value will be given. An ArcGIS 10.2 platform was set up to handle the large quantity of data with spatial extent and to produce the maps. General trends in burial practices At Sänket there is very little, if any, positive evidence for ritual practices associated with the burial ceremony itself. There are very few vessels that can be attributed with confidence to deposits outside the graves or among the stone piles covering them, and there is overall little indi cation that communal feasting might have occurred in the graveyard (there are no animal bones, no recognisable refuse pits for drinking/eating vessels, no hearths and only a single stray fire stand). One exception could be repre sented by an in situ podium-like structure made of burnt clay set beside the richest tomb, 243 (Seeher 2000: 94), which may have been used for offerings during or after the burial. Interments are not arranged in an orderly fashion and newer graves often disturbed or destroyed earlier ones, contrary to other burial grounds such as Babaköy, Yortan and Küçükhöyük (Bittel et al. 1939/1941; Kamil 1982; Gürkan, Seeher 1991). This might be explained by the lack of archaeologically-recognisable tomb markers that have been found in other contemporary cemeteries (for example the small stone circles at Karataş; cf. Mellink 1969: 319— 20). Patterns of differential access/segregation of age/ gender groups, types of burial containers and artefacts in specific areas of the necropolis were observed, but the results are not sufficiently strong to be proven statistically (cf. also Seeher 2000: 222; Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 270 71). A statistical analysis performed on the orientation of the bodies, however, indicates that over 90% (311 out of 340 analysed cases) lay with the head towards the east or southeast, with most outliers at the borders of this distri bution (fig. 5); notably, the interments are almost never oriented toward the settlement, located to the northeast of the cemetery. The necropolis shows the contemporary presence of interments in a variety of burial containers; while there is a detectable variability in the range of forms and materials, several different types can be recognised, as detailed below (see also table 2). (a) Jar burials (fig. 6a-b) can be composed of one vessel closed with a small heap of stones (single jar) or by two vessels facing each other (double jars), and represent the main form of burial present in the necropolis. Unlike western Anatolian necropoleis such as Bakla Tepe and Karataş where the pithoi used for burial are often over 2m in height and lm in width, at Sänket vessels never exceed 1,3m in height and 0.6m in width (i.e. three times smaller in volume than at other western Anatolian necropoleis). Vessels of similar size and shape are found throughout the settlement's phases, suggesting that burial jars were often, if not always, reused after their primary employment in domestic contexts (Seeher 2000: 48).

Grave types present in the Sänket necropolis: (a) single jar burial; (b) double jar burial; (c) simple pit burial; (d) stone-lined pit burial; (e) stone cist burial; (J) clay tub burial (after Seeher 2000). (b) Simple pit burials (fig. 6c) are basic dug-out features, normally oval in shape; these were often not recognised as graves during excavation unless bones and/ or associated grave goods were present (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 243). Even though wooden features were not preserved in the pit graves, the occurrence of wooden planks and coffins at several other sites, such as Alişar Höyük, Alacahöyük and Barçın Höyük (von der Osten 1937: 44; Gürsan-Salzmann 1992: 69; Roodenberg, Alpaslan-Roodenberg 2008: 57), suggest that the Sänket specimens may have been similarly equipped. (c) Stone-lined pit burials (fig. 6d) are dug-out features with a perimeter of unworked stones, sometimes oval but more often square in shape and generally larger than simple pits and more spacious than jar burials. Only one course of stones is normally preserved, but it is possible that a simple wooden frame might have been placed on the sides and/or as a cover, in a fashion similar to the more 79</page><page sequence="8">Anatolian Studies 2014 elaborate and more lavishly-equipped Alacahöyük 'royal' graves (cf. Gürsan-Salzmann 1992: 62). In some cases, large stone slabs were used to seal the top of the structure. (d) Stone cist burials (fig. 6e) are entirely built with flat slabs and tend to be shaped in the form of rectangular boxes, although in several instances the structure is not regular and is built with unshaped or smaller stones. In at least one case (G.390) wooden planks were identified under the body. (e) The single clay tub burial (G.100; fig. 6f) has parallels neither within the cemetery nor across the region, and is composed of a 15cm-thick layer of in situ burnt clay in the shape of a tub. The occupant of the grave was an adult male buried with rich grave goods, among which was an imported fenestrated axe (Seeher 2000: 55-56). While the time and energy employed in the construc tion of individual graves cannot be estimated with precision, it still seems reasonable to conclude that there were significant differences in time and energy expendi ture related to the different burial types. Arguably, the preparation of jar (the jars being brought from the settle ment) and simple pit burials were the less demanding and might have required the labour of two or three individuals at most. On the other hand, the construction of the larger stone-lined pits and stone cists would have been signifi cantly more challenging, not only because the most likely stone source for these slabs is located 5km away from the settlement, but also because a larger workforce would have been needed to handle the stone blocks; grave G.117 (one of the 'chiefly' burials, see below) was built with slabs so large that it took six workers to lift each of them out of the pit during excavation (Seeher 2000: 22, 29). With regards to interment practices, each grave normally yielded a single inhumation laid on its side in a foetal position; multiple burials in anatomical connection are much rarer and almost invariably involve a combina tion of adult and child. In some cases, burial containers were reused for later depositions; this practice can be seen in 43 out of 474 analysed burials (9%), but seems to have been more common in stone cist burials; 16 out of 33 (48%) contained from two to four consecutive interments. Analysis of the sequence of different burial events within each grave ascertained at least 557 distinct episodes of interment in 497 tombs. Whilst there is a general absence of positive evidence for extensive reburial of bodies into new graves, the disarticulated remains of seven adults contained within small pottery vessels suggest that in some cases a more careful selection and conservation of earlier interments may have occurred (Seeher 2000: 27). In most instances, however, bones and grave goods were simply cleared away and put outside the container prior to its reuse, where often only long bones and skulls survived decomposition. It has been suggested to me that pithoi might have been used as containers for primary interments only and that stone cists/pits were used for secondary inter ments (see Bachhuber 2008: 162-63 for a similar hypoth esis), however, this idea does not stand up to close scrutiny. First, interments in anatomical connection occur in all grave types, for example in simple pits G.83, G.151, G.270 and G.325, stone-lined pit G.131 and cists G.340 and G.350 among others. Second, all container types are targeted for reuse, albeit in different proportions (see above); while it is true that stone cists are statistically more affected than other grave types, this might be explained by the fact that their sturdier construction would have allowed for easier reopening. Third, the absence or scarcity of human remains in all grave forms (there is a lack of human remains in ca 30% of the graves) can be explained by a range of post-depositional factors such as the acidic nature of the soil, ancient disturbance, recent agricultural activi ties and modern looting, rather than the common practice of secondary interments (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 240 41). Finally, most of the empty graves seem to belong to children, whose remains are more prone to bone decay (see further below); in these instances, decay seems a more plausible explanation for the lack of bones than secondary interment elsewhere. Indeed, with the exception of two individuals interred in tumuli at Karataş and Harmanören/ Göndürle - possibly community leaders - proven examples of secondary bone manipulation are very rare in EBA Anatolia (Mellink 1969: 324-27; Özsait 2004: 24 25; Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming), in contrast, for example, to contemporary sites on mainland Greece and Cyprus where a range of secondary treatments can be observed (Cultraro 2007; Keswani 2013). Grave goods (565 objects in total) normally comprise pottery vessels, small items of metal jewellery and weapons (fig. 7). Thirty two small lead bottles (8-20cm in height) possibly contained perfume or other valuable (cosmetic?) liquids. Other personal belongings include rattles and feeding bottles in child tombs and several types of working tools, such as spindle whorls, needles, awls, stone hammers, stone axes and copper hatchets. Of partic ular interest are the numerous 'diadems', small metal strips found on the foreheads of ca 10% of all interments; in some cases (as in the adult male from grave G.243) a second metal strip was applied on the mouth, a practice also recog nised at Kültepe during the later EBA (Özgüç 1986: 25). The diadems may have been especially produced for the burial ceremony, since their thinness would have led them to break very easily and thus be inpractical for other uses; furthermore, one diadem is clearly reworked from a gold ear stud and others show signs of hasty and approximate manufacture (Seeher 2000: 62). Other items may have been produced especially for public display; the copper mace in grave G.334 was broken during production and 80</page><page sequence="9">Massa Fig. 7. Selection of grave goods from Sänket, to scale: (a) fenestrated axe from G.100; (b) spearhead from G.243; (c) hammer-axe from G.494; (d) lead bottle from G.160; (e) dagger from G.266; (J) flat axe from G. 117/132; (g) razor from G.350; (h) spatulafrom G.213; (i) bracelet from G.37; (j) marble figurine from G.213; (k) mace from G.160; (I) knobbed mace from G.316; (m) rattle from G. 71; (n) diadem from G.350; (o) axe from G.250 (after Seeher 2000: figs 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 33, 34, 41, 49). restored with lead infilling, but the surface was not polished and remained irregular, suggesting that it was never used. The daggers, too, were most probably not fit for battle given their extreme thinness and absence of midrib; they were thus perhaps made for display only and were not used as weapons. The osteological data A large portion of the following analysis relies on the detailed osteological report on all identifiable individuals produced by the excavation's physical anthropologist (Wittwer-Backofen 2000). However, ancient and recent disturbance, the acidic nature of the soil and looting have affected the state of preservation of large numbers of remains, particularly those of females and children whose bones are generally more prone to deterioration than those of adult males; bone decay was particularly pronounced in jar burials, much less so in cist burials (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 240-41, fig. 76). As a result, only 363 individuals from 497 tombs could be identified; 28% of intact graves yielded no recognisable human remains. From this dataset, only 180 individuals could be sexed, with varying degrees of precision, while age attribution could be produced for 346 individuals (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: appendix 1). In order to perform statistical comparisons between age/ gender classes of the deceased and their associated burial Containers and grave goods (see below), two analyses have been used to expand considerably the number of aged and gendered individuals. With regards to gender attribution, the physical anthro pologist noted that the vast majority of females are inhumed on the left side (95%) and most of the males on the right side (94%), a pattern that is statistically significant at p value &lt;0.01 (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 245). While most other Anatolian funerary contexts are devoid of detailed osteological analysis and thus do not provide further proof of this trend, the same pattern has been reported at Hacilartepe near the Sea of Marmara (Alpaslan-Roodenberg 2002: 95). It is therefore possible to assume that at Sänket this was the normative behavioural pattern in the necropolis. This assumption allows us to extend gender determination to a further 51 individuals whose burial position is known but whose sex is unknown through osteological analysis, bringing the total number of gendered (adult) interments to 231. Since individuals that have not reached puberty do not normally present sufficient markers to establish a determi nation of biological sex, in the following analysis all sub adult individuals are grouped together. With regards to age attribution, it has been noted previ ously that small graves consistently contain children up to eight years old only (Wittwer-Backofen 2000: 242). This hypothesis was tested using aged interments in intact jars 81</page><page sequence="10">Anatolian Studies 2014 for which the size could be measured (208 in total). While the lack of published measurements prevents the employ ment of volume as an index of size, preliminary analysis proves that grave area (calculated from published plans) can be used successfully. The results (summarised in fig. 8) show that burials smaller than 0.4m2 (approximate height = 75cm, width = 50cm) are exclusively occupied by children, a pattern statistically significant at p-value &lt;0.05. We are able, therefore, to extend the age attribution to a further 87 graves, raising the total number of aged inter ments to 433. Incidentally, this analysis also shows that most of the graves without any recognisable human remains tend to be smaller than 0.4m2 (over 60%), suggesting that they belong to children (fig. 9). The empty nature of many of the graves at Demircihöyük-Sanket is thus, in all likeli hood, the result of poor preservation of the bones (affecting those of younger individuals more severely) rather than them being structures purposefully left devoid of a body (cenotaphs), as has been suggested by others (for example Özsait 2003: 88; Bachhuber 2008: 318). Correlation between age/gender classes and grave forms All aged individuals associated with a recognisable grave type (259 specimens) were analysed; interments that had been removed from their original grave or whose age was inferred only from statistical analysis were excluded from this dataset. Figure 10 shows a clear correlation between burial container and age class, with an almost total absence of children in simple pits, stone-lined pits and cists; in all cases where children were buried in a pit or cist grave, they are coupled with an adult. Juveniles are found in all container types except for stone cists, whilst older adults 100% 90"!'. 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% II □ adult (59) ojuvenilc(8) □ child (59) 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 + arca (sqm) Fig. 8.

It therefore seems that age was a decisive element in the choice of burial container. Children started to be treated differently in the funerary ceremony at around 10-12 years of age, at which stage they were sometimes put in grave types normally reserved for adults; burial in cists was reserved for adults and, in particular, older adults. Furthermore, all gendered individuals (173 adults) associated with a recognisable grave type were analysed. Figure 11 shows that adult females tend to be more closely associated with single jar burials, while adult males are more tightly correlated with stone-lined pits and stone cists (p-value &lt;0.05). 82</page><page sequence="11">Massa Correlation between age/gender classes and object types The aim of this analysis is to understand whether specific items can be associated with interments of a specific age or gender group. Only interments with no positive evidence of disturbance (including reuse) were consid ered, in combination with information on gender and age gathered from previous analyses and on recognisable grave types. To simplify the analytical procedures and to make the sample more statistically robust, the age/gender classes were grouped into three categories, namely sub adults (under 11 years), adult males and adult females (above 11 years of age). To highlight the statistical asso ciation between age/gender class and different object types a cross-tabulation was compiled, employing 321 interments for which age and gender determinations were available and 391 objects associated with these interments (table 3). The results show that most common grave good types, such as pottery, diadems and pins, are associated with all age/gender groups, although to different degrees. Some rarer types are exclusive to one age/gender class, as detailed below, although the small number of specimens for each makes the correlation statistically not significant. (a) Arm-rings, ear studs, necklaces, the spatula, rattles, marble/ceramic 'idols' and 'feeding bottles' are associated only with sub-adults. (b) Copper maceheads, axes, the spearhead, the silver 'idol', the whetstone, razors, lead diadems and gold rings are found exclusively with adult males. (c) Females do not seem to have gender-specific grave goods (on the shaft-hole axe noted in table 3, see below). Two find categories include items found primarily associated with adult males. (a) Weapons are associated with 12.4% of male burials, against 3.4% of female interments and 1.6% of sub-adult graves. However, in all cases where weapons are found with non-male individuals, they do not seem to have been Single jar Double jar IB ■ male □ female II Simple pit St-lined pit Stone cist Fig. 11.

In graves G.305 (a woman) and G.517 (a child), daggers were deposited on top of small jars which were also part of the grave assemblage, while in grave G.479 a dagger was bent on the forehead of the child in the form of a diadem. Finally, the osteological analysis identifies the individuals in graves G.494 and G.434, asso ciated with a metal shaft-hole axe and a stone macehead respectively, as biologically female, but they were laid on their right sides (in other words, their burial position is normally associated with males). (b) Metal objects in general seem to be slightly more associated with males; however, precious metals (silver and gold) and lead bottles are more closely associated with men (19% of male graves contained at least one such artefact, against 11.5% of female and 7% of sub-adult). Correlation between wealth and interments The first step of the analysis of the correlation between wealth and interments aimed at understanding the distri bution of wealth within the necropolis; the dataset consisted of 327 burials with no positive evidence of disturbance (including reuse) and 491 items associated with them. What appears evident from table 4 is that while 28% of intact graves do not have any recognisable associ ated item, ca 10% of the wealthier tombs (those containing four or more objects) contain 35% of all grave goods (172 items out of 491), suggesting a concentration of wealth in a small number of burials. However, despite several attempts using different analytical procedures, spatial clus tering of these wealthier burials can not be observed within the necropolis area, and, particularly, they are not associ ated with the 'chiefly' burials discussed below. The second step of the analysis looked at the correla tion between age/gender classes and the number of objects within the grave; this was performed on a smaller dataset that included only interments with known age/gender determination (242 specimens). Figure 12 shows that ca 45% of interments under 11 years of age have no recog nisable grave goods and that these burials tend to have fewer items than the average adult burial; nonetheless, there are a few rich child burials. Women tend to have less goods than men buried with them, but, again, there are some exceptions. Burials of older adults have, in general, more grave goods than all other age/gender classes (p value &lt;0.0001). The correlation between the number of objects associ ated with each interment and burial container types was also tested; the dataset was composed of 307 burials with no signs of disturbance. Figure 13 shows that jar burials are more likely to be devoid of artefacts or to yield interments with fewer artefacts than stone-lined pits and cists (p-value 83</page><page sequence="12">Anatolian Studies 2014 Object types Object count/ (burials) Adult females (87) Adult males (105) Sub adults (129) Adult females % Adult males % Sub adults % Shaft-hole axe (Cu alloy) Macehead (Cu alloy) Macehead (stone) Spearhead (Cu alloy) Fenestrated axe (Cu alloy) Axe (stone) Razor (Cu alloy) Whetstone Dagger (Cu alloy) Diadem (Cu alloy) Diadem (gold) Diadem (lead) Diadem (silver) Arm-ring (Cu alloy) Spatula (Cu alloy) Ear studs (gold) Pin (Cu alloy) Pin (silver) Hair-ring (Cu alloy) Ring (gold) Ring (silver) Idol (silver) Idol (marble/ceramic) Perfume bottle (lead) Necklace (various) Spindle whorl Shroud with whorls Rattle Feeding bottle Bowl Jar Jug Miniature vessel All pottery Silver/gold/lead diadems All weapons No. of graves with metal No. of graves with silver/gold/lead 1 2 10 6 22 22/(20) 2/(1) 6 7/(4) 1 2/(1) 73/(68) 4 10/(8) 3 3 1 8/(4) 29/(28) 8 55/(31) 2 2 2 36/(29) 30/(27) 181/(137) 4 247/(193) 29/(28) 26/(24) 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 5 0 1 0 0 0 18 1 I 0 1 0 0 6 4 II 1 0 0 10 8 36 0 54 6 3 26 10 0 1 5 10 1 4 0 0 0 28 2 0 2 0 1 0 12 2 11 1 0 0 8 9 44 1 61 15 13 34 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7 5 0 0 2 1 1 16 1 5 0 2 0 4 4 1 5 0 1 2 5 7 46 3 58 5 2 29 9 1.1 0.0 1.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.1 5.7 5.7 0.0 1.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.7 1.1 1.1 0.0 1.1 0.0 0.0 6.9 4.6 12.6 1.1 0.0 0.0 11.5 9.2 41.4 0.0 62.1 6.9 3.4 29.9 11.5 0.0 1.0 1.0 3.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 26.7 1.9 0.0 1.9 0.0 1.0 0.0 11.4 1.9 10.5 1.0 0.0 0.0 7.6 8.6 41.9 1.0 58.1 14.3 12.4 32.4 19.0 3.9 5.4 35.7 2.3 45.0 3.9 1.6 22.5 7.0 Table 3.

Considering the hypothesis that the lower score for jar burials might have been influenced by the presence of child interments, the analysis was repeated on adult burials only; the results did not alter significantly. The presence of lead, silver and gold artefacts was also tested against burial type, and figure 14 shows that stone-lined pits and cists tend to have higher percentages of artefacts made of precious metals than the other container types. Anomalous burials The presence of eight pairs of cattle burials is one of the most striking features of the necropolis; while several of these were disturbed by later activity, the best-preserved examples were found still articulated and complete, thus excluding the possibility that they had been consumed during the burial ceremony (Seeher 2000: 31). These animal interments were in all likelihood connected with seven nearby stone cists or stone-lined pits (G. 117, G. 125, G.316, G.321, G.335, G.367B and G.376), some of the largest graves of the whole necropolis; the eighth twin cattle burial was close to an Iron Age tumulus that probably destroyed the associated EBA grave. The presumed asso ciation of the cattle burials with these graves is directly proved in one case (G. 117), where the pit dug for the tomb also contained the animal remains. Furthermore, in six cases the cattle were placed directly in front of the interred individual's head, 1.5-2m outside the grave, and with their heads oriented in the same direction as that of the grave occupant (figs 15-16; Seeher 2000: 31).

Furthermore, due to this disturbance the identity of the original occupants of these burials cannot be determined with certainty. Finally, three unique knobbed maces/sceptres (fig. 71) were found in disturbed contexts inside or very close by three of these stone graves. Comparison with other necropoleis may be helpful in determining the possible identity of the interred individuals (fig. 17). Knobbed maces of very similar manufacture are recorded across central Anatolia, although most of them are known from museum collections only and are uncon textualised (Zimmermann 2006). The only find with a precisely known context, and a perfect match with the Sänket examples, is the gold specimen from tomb B at the Alacahöyük 'royal' cemetery, which was recently redated on the basis of new radiocarbon samples to between ca 2800 and 2450 cal. BC (Yalçın, Yalçın 2013: 38), i.e. over lapping the period of use of Demircihöyük-Sariket. In addition to the golden knobbed mace, tomb B contained cattle, sheep and dog remains, many gold items and six ceremonial standards that were decorated with depictions Grave G.335 A 1m Cattle burial RB 5 » o,» Ik Fig. 16. Plan of grave G.335 and the associated twin cattle burial RB5 (after Seeher 2000: fig. 10). of knobbed maces (Zimmerman 2006: 342). The context of the piece, therefore, suggests that these maces may have been displayed as symbols of authority. Cattle burials are also attested in various central Anatolian necropoleis, always in connection with human interments: at Alacahöyük itself (Gürsan-Salzmann 1992), at the EBA III site of Resuloğlu (Yıldırım 2006: 449), at Çavdarlı Höyük (Seeher 2000: 31) and at the EBA II/III cemetery of Gedikli Höyük (Alkım, Alkım 1969: 54). With very little contextual information provided for most of these examples (in particular the age/gender of the interred individual and details of the associated grave goods), the Alacahöyük example is again the most striking evidence for the association of this ritual with high-status individuals. It thus seems possible to surmise that the original occupants of these burials might have been indi viduals with a special social status within the Demirci höyük community, possibly its leaders. In addition to these 'chiefly' burials, there are two other burials that stand out from the rest of the analysed graves. The first (G.100) belongs to an older adult male buried in what appears to be a unique 'clay tub', burnt in situ. The body was interred with a fenestrated axe of arsenical bronze (fig. 7a) - a probable import from south-central Anatolia - a lead bottle, a silver diadem, two metal pins and ajar. The 86</page><page sequence="15">Massa grave's position at the northern outskirts of the necropolis, its anomalous burial container and its exotic panoply of grave goods suggest that the individual may have been external to the Demircihöyük community, although this is only a conjecture. The second (G.243) is the most varied tomb in the cemetery and contained the remains of an adult male buried inside a stone cist grave, with a spearhead in tin bronze (fig. 7b) - a probable import from Cilicia or Upper Mesopotamia - a copper mace, two gold diadems, a pin, a needle, two spindle whorls, one jug and a miniature vessel. Just outside the grave there was a burnt in situ clay structure interpreted as a 'podium' (Seeher 2000: 94). The individual interred in the grave exhibits evidence of a healed slash injury to the cranium. The anomalous features of these graves (unique burial container/unique podium structure), coupled with rich assemblages containing possibly imported objects, point to them being the burials of high-status individuals; their association with weapons might indicate that the interred individuals played prominent roles during violent episodes of the settlement's life, although this suggestion remains speculative. Finally in this discussion of anomalous burials, the presence of five child burials (G.37, G.79, G.213, G.295 and G.309) that yielded some of the wealthiest assemblages in the necropolis (including gold diadems, gold necklaces, gold ear studs, marble figurines and other copper/bronze implements) should be noted. Child graves are in most cases among the less-furnished of the necropolis. Newborns in the settlement were not even accorded a formal grave, whilst ca 45% of child burials in the necropolis did not contain any accompanying objects. It is not clear, however, why certain children were accorded such wealthy burials; the practice may have been associated with special events surrounding the moment of death or simply a higher emotional attachment of the parents, rather than being related to wealth/status dynamics (Parker Pearson 1999: 103-04; Robb 2007: 63-65). Nonetheless, it is tempting to suggest, albeit difficult to prove, that these rich child graves are an expression of a small segment of the community with preferential access to luxury goods (one family?). Demircihöyük-Sarıket within the context of EBA Anatolian funerary practices There are several funerary features that can be traced across western and central Anatolian necropoleis during the third millennium BC; one of the most obvious is the practice of depositing the deceased in a foetal position on the left or right side. Another shared trait is the general similarity in the composition of the grave assemblages. While specific object types differ from region to region, closed and open vessels, spindle whorls, small items of jewellery, weapons and tools characterise most of the 7Oymanğ«ç İ Resııloğlıı Ankara Demircihöyük Gedikli SW Anatolia Alaçam/ ^"kç&lt;ım v (Black-Sea region; ■s,&lt; iASEc""'' ■■ i ıı^rı •.

Map offinds of cattle burials and knobbed maces across Anatolia. 87</page><page sequence="16">Anatolian Studies 2014 published grave assemblages (Massa, Şahoğlu forth coming). Throughout the region there is also a striking uniformity in the treatment of babies (up to one year of age); they are normally buried under house floors with no goods even when extramural cemeteries are present (Massa, Şahoğlu 2011: 165). Similarly, the burial of children is in most cases matched by a general poverty of grave goods, though a few very rich assemblages display striking similarities across the area and are normally composed of small items of jewellery (gold ear studs, necklaces with metal or semi-precious stone beads, metal rings) and/or items pertinent to the age of the interred indi viduals (feeding bottles, marble figurines, spatulas, rattles). This is best seen at Karataş, Gavurtepe, Küçükhöyük and Kalinkaya (Alpers-Bordaz 1978: 262-79; Gürkan, Seeher 1991; Meriç 1993; Zimmermann 2007). The practice of either intramural (under house floors or between buildings) or extramural (in areas beyond settlements) burial of individuals older than one year is a clear regional marker in EBA Anatolian funerary customs. While intramural burials are characteristic of most Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements, the earliest formal graveyards seem to occur along the coasts of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea between 5000 and 3500 BC at the sites of Kumtepe IA, Aktoprakhk, Ilıpınar and İkiztepe (Korfmann 1996: 50-51; Roodenberg 2008; Welton 2010; Alpaslan-Roodenberg 2011). The custom did not spread to western Anatolia until the late fourth millen nium BC, the earliest well-stratified contexts being found at Kusura A and Bakla Tepe (Lamb 1937; Şahoğlu forth coming). Across most of the central plateau, an area that encompasses Konya-Karahöyük, Gordion, Alişar Höyük and Kültepe, however, intramural burials continued to be the exclusive form of interment throughout the third and second millennia BC (Akyurt 1998; Massa, Şahoğlu forth coming: fig. 3). Thus, the extramural cemetery of Sänket (the earliest of its kind on the central plateau) indicates strong cultural affiliations with communities further west. Another important divide is the orientation of the deceased's head. Well-investigated western Anatolian necropoleis such as Yortan, Harmanören, Karataş and Küçükhöyük (Stech-Wheeler 1974: 416; Kamil 1982; Gürkan, Seeher 1991; Özsait 2003) demonstrate that an east-southeast direction is the standard orientation during the EBA II—III (ca 2800-1950 BC) in western Anatolia; this pattern may be related to the position of the rising sun in different seasons. Contemporary graves on the central plateau, however, do not display any consistency in the orientation of the deceased (Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming: fig. 5). The fact that 90% of the individuals interred at Sänket were oriented east-southeast again suggests signif icant cultural borrowing from inland western Anatolian communities. On the other hand, during the EBA II—II period the predominance of single-interment graves seems typical of central Anatolian cemeteries, while western Anatolian necropoleis normally display collective inhumations. Furthermore, the use of different grave types is a hallmark of central Anatolian burial practices throughout the whole EBA, while western Anatolian practices essentially revolve around interment in large 'family' pithoi (Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming: figs 7-8). With regards to these elements, the practices noted at Demircihöyük-Sarıket are clearly closer to those of the neighbouring communities to the east. Regarding the treatment of elite community members, we unfortunately have only a limited picture for western Anatolian, where none of the cemeteries belonging to major excavated settlements has so far been investigated. Nonetheless, it has been suggested recently that the apparent absence of elite burials might be related to different mechanisms of prestige display, with lowland sites investing more on monumental architecture and highland sites investing more on lavish funerary cere monies (Bachhuber 2008: 242^18). However, the lack of known rich western Anatolian funerary contexts is in all likelihood the result of post-depositional factors rather than a real pattern. For instance, there is plentiful evidence that in western Anatolia formal extramural burials were the standard custom for body disposal; intramural adult remains are in all cases connected with destruction levels and should thus be considered the remains of unretrieved victims of accidental death rather than intentional deposi tions (Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming). It is therefore unlikely that the whole population of the major centres would have been buried inside the settlement or disposed of with archaeologically-invisible rituals. Furthermore, most of the main EBA centres (Troy, Liman Tepe, Beyce sultan, Ayasuluk/Ephesus, Miletus, Bergama, Smyrna and Hacimusalar, among others) have a very long and uninter rupted history of occupation. Given that the size of later settlements is invariably larger than those of the EBA and that EBA cemeteries are in general situated quite close to residential areas (within 50-300m), it is very probable that subsequent urban expansion may have obliterated the prehistoric necropoleis. All of these sites are located in the middle of substantial alluvial/colluvial plains, and an EBA graveyard on the valley floor would now be under several metres of sediment, with little chance of discovery. When we do have evidence of elite burials in medium/ small-sized western Anatolian communities, they seem rather different from those on the central plateau which are characterised by animal burials and a range of symbolic paraphernalia such as knobbed maces, sistra and zoomor phic/abstract standards (Zimmermann 2008). For example, at the sites of Karataş and Harmanören/Göndürle (EBA II</page><page sequence="17">Massa late) in southwestern Anatolia a single stone-built chamber surmounted by a small earth-and-stone tumulus was in both cases found in a large cemetery otherwise charac terised by the exclusive presence of jar burials. Both bodies were disarticulated and secondary depositions, and the individual at Karataş was an adult male associated with a metal razor and many silver and gold appliques and casings, possibly relating to several pieces of cloth orna mentation or an inlayed wooden box (Mellink 1969: 324 27; Özsait 2004: 24-25). At Bakla Tepe (EBA III) near the eastern Aegean coast, the richest grave in the necropolis is that of an adult woman(?) laid on the right side within a very large pithos and associated with a metal shaft-hole axe, a razor, a cloak pin, three fine-ware vessels and a bird shaped bone seal (Şahoğlu forthcoming). The single grave of Ballıca (EBA II late) in Manisa, a chance find, includes two fine marble bowls of Cycladic origin, a silver 'mirror', a fenestrated axe, a dagger, a spear, a knife, a flat axe and an awl (Takaoğlu 2004). Thus, again, the elite burials of Demircihöyük-Sarıket immediately recall practices found at sites further east on the central plateau. Finally, the cemetery of Sänket is one of the few contexts where it is possible to observe the evolution of burial practices from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age (MBA). Despite the 800-900 years that intervene between the two phases of the cemetery, a striking continuity in burial types, assemblages and funerary rites can be observed. During the second millennium BC use of the burial ground, the only exceptions to this continuity are the presence of cremations and the absence of cattle inter ments (Seeher2000: 224-25). Strong similarities between EBA and MBA practices can also be contextually followed at the sites of Ulucak Höyük, Harmanören/Göndürle and Salur Höyük (Özsait 2003; Çilingiroğlu et al. 2005; İbiş, Durmuş 2010), and can be appreciated further by comparing the present analysis with that of MBA funerary customs published elsewhere (Akyurt 1998). Discussion of the results Estimates based on pre-industrial societies (Robb 2007) show that in a prehistoric community around 40% of the population would have been under 15 years of age; therefore, we can assume that at Demircihöyük between 60 and 80 adults were present at any one time. It was a small community, especially when compared to other sites in the area, and the settlement record does not show any evidence of extreme social inequalities such as treasure hoards or public buildings, as is the case at Troy and nearby Küllüoba. What is most striking about Demirci höyük, known mostly from the better-preserved late EBA I and early EBA II levels (phases F and H), is the sense of strong communality that emerges from an analysis of the dataset. Despite the fact that most households seem to have been self-sufficient in their primary needs - for example with regards to pottery production, knapping, spinning, weaving and the manufacture of ground-stone and harvesting tools - most activities were performed in the central courtyard or in the front rooms, visible to everybody (Baykal-Seeher, Obladen-Kauder 1996). The common central space was also where the large storage facilities were located, suggesting shared control of (agri cultural?) wealth. As noted by the excavator, the party walls between the houses meant that repair and reconstruc tion works probably had to take place simultaneously and communally, at least within the same block of houses; this is a hypothesis suggested also by the striking continuity in plan, size and location of the buildings throughout the 16 architectural phases and 8m of stratigraphy (Korfmann 1983: 243). In phase H (early EBAII), all but two of the 12 buildings shared similar areas (around 55m2) and were separated into two spaces. The two houses on either side of the northeastern gate, on the contrary, had three rooms each and were significantly larger than the other dwellings (95m2 and 120m2). Their size, position and number of rooms may indicate a special function, either as communal buildings or as signifiers of the higher status of the occupants (Korfmann 1983: 243; Çevik 2007: 136), but this supposition cannot be confirmed by differences in terms of the archaeological finds. The results of the analysis of the necropolis, while agreeing with the generally accepted picture of the settle ment, allow for a deeper insight of some of the social dynamics present in the settlement. In particular, they allow the exploration of issues of horizontal variability (i.e. differences in treatment dependent on characteristics that cannot be voluntary changed, such as age and gender) and vertical variability (i.e. differences in treatment dependent on characteristics that can be achieved through personal advancement or inheritance, such as attaining a position of leadership or practising specialised craftsmanship; Parker Pearson 1999). In this regard, it is important to stress that the social identity of an individual is composed of various coexisting elements (for example an adult male can be a potter and a warrior and a husband and a father and a carpenter and a farmer) which do not necessarily have the same degree of visibility in the archaeological record of funerary material. Indeed, one of the limits of this analysis is the inability to assess items made of perish able materials that are not visible in the archaeological record and which, if they had survived, might have provided a different picture of the individuals buried in the necropolis. Also, the smaller the individual grave assem blage, the less we can say about the social identity of the deceased; thus we risk skewing our interpretation towards the (archaeologically) more visible segments of the community. 89</page><page sequence="18">Anatolian Studies 2014 With these issues in mind, it still seems clear that there are indeed some important differences in how different members of the community were treated in their funerary ceremony. In particular, substantial horizontal variations (i.e. related to ascribed status) can be detected with regard to age classes. At the lowest end of the spectrum, stillborns and babies were rarely if ever accorded burial in the extra mural necropolis and were instead interred under the floors of the houses without any grave goods or containers. Children (from one to 11 years of age) were always buried in small jars and 45% of them had no archaeologically recoverable grave goods. Juveniles (11-17 years) were sometimes interred in jars, sometimes in simple pits. On the other hand, adults and particularly older adults were much more likely to be buried in stone cists, stone-lined pits or large pithoi (arguably more energy expensive) and tend to have more grave goods, especially silver/gold artefacts. While gender seems, overall, to be a less important variable for differentiation in the cemetery, it is by no means wholly unimportant, with the wealthiest graves being predomi nantly those of adult males and a tighter association of men with stone-lined pits and cists. Furthermore, specific sets of objects can be associated exclusively or predominantly with certain age or gender categories. Small children (one to six years of age) are significantly associated with rattles, feeding bottles, clay or marble figurines and certain types of jewellery. Adult males have overall associations with weaponry and razors, while adult females are - at least from the surviving archaeological evidence - not exclusively associated with a specific set of items. As previously suggested by J.L. Angel with regards to the Karataş necropolis, it is possible to surmise that major variations in how individuals were buried may reflect specific rites of passage that defined the position of a person within the larger community; these were apparently set at ca one year of age and at ca 11-12 years of age (Angel 1976: 387). Furthermore, in the general absence of research on gender differentiation in EBA Anatolian societies, Demircihöyük-Sarıket represents the first case study in which it is possible to observe that males and females were treated differently in the burial ceremony. This is detectable, for example, in the position in which the body was interred (on the right side for males; on the left side for females), in the higher proportion of men interred in more energy-expensive graves and with larger quantities of grave goods, and in the association of partic ular artefacts exclusively or predominantly with males (for example weapons and gold/silver items). On a smaller scale, some vertical differences (i.e. those related to achieved status) can also be identified. For instance, the so-called 'chiefly' burials are characterised by some of the largest stone cists or stone-lined pits in the necropolis, are associated with twin cattle burials and are, in three cases, associated with unusual knobbed maces. The funerary treatment of these individuals seems to point to an intentional formalisation of social differences, at least during the burial ceremony, and the presence of high-status individuals in the cemetery is possibly mirrored in the settlement record, where two of the excavated houses are much larger than the others and might have been occupied by important members of the community. Such peculiar ritual clearly reflects a familiarity with funerary ceremonies of elite groups located further east in central Anatolia, and may further be read as an attempt to emulate behaviours of elite display performed at larger sites such as Alacahöyük. At Sänket, however, the absence of extreme social inequal ities (at least in the surviving archaeological record) indicates that the scale of social stratification is less marked than at other EBA cemeteries, probably because of the much smaller size of the community. This is further confirmed by the absence of a clearly definable nucleus of richer graves spatially separated from the others, an obser vation that contrasts with the burial pattern seen at the contemporary necropolis of Karataş, a small settlement in the Lycian highlands with an estimated 500-600 inhabi tants, i.e. four or five times larger than Demircihöyük (Warner 1994: 175-77). Here, the majority of the gold and silver objects as well as all the most elaborate jewellery items was concentrated in the child and adult graves around AQ 367, a tumulus identified as the burial site of the community leader (Mellink 1969: 327; Alpers-Bordaz 1978: 262-78; Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming: fig. 9). Another group of graves that might shed light on vertical differentiations is those associated with weapons (ca 12% of the total adult male burials). While generally not differing from other interments in terms of wealth and grave types, the fact that the community chose to bury them with weapons suggests that the deceased's participa tion in warfare was important enough to be a prominent characteristic in the funerary display. The retrieval of the remains of five adult males with weapon injuries on their skulls and arms (three of which were buried with weapons; Wittwer-Backofen 200: 272) further indicates that spears, maces and axes were not simply symbolic but were actually used in battle. The weapons and weapon injuries in the necropolis are complementary with clear signs of a sudden destruction of the settlement (at the end of phase L), possibly due to a violent conflict and involving the whole excavated area (Korfmann 1983: 189). This picture reflects that drawn by the substantial archaeological evidence of fortifications, settlement destructions, deposi tions of weaponry in graves and weapon injuries across Anatolia during the later part of the EBA; it would seem that warfare was an increasingly frequent medium of inter action and dispute-resolution between neighbouring communities (Massa, Şahoğlu 2011: 166; Massa 2014). 90</page><page sequence="19">Massa Other forms of vertical variability, for instance the presence of at least two other rich graves with weapons, silver/gold objects and peculiar burial features (G. 100 and G.243) and the 'rich' child burials (G.37, G.79, G.213, G.295 and G.309), are less clear, especially in the absence of similar contexts with comparable analysis. It is, however, important to stress that the presence of tools in the funerary assemblage (for example stone hammers, hatchets, spindle whorls and copper needles) shows that the social identity of the deceased might also have been conveyed by their occupation in life, hinting that some degree of craft specialisation may have been in place. The presence of tools in the funerary assemblage seems to be an EBA innovation and they are present in several other cemeteries in western Anatolia and the Aegean (Massa, Şahoğlu forthcoming). Overall, the results of these analyses challenge the conclusion offered by Seeher that no significant differences could be discerned between different age/gender groups in terms of grave wealth, association with specific objects or choice of burial containers (Seeher 2000: 222). They also suggest that it would be incorrect to regard Demircihöyük and other small EBA Anatolian communities as 'egali tarian societies'; the analysis of the funerary assemblages has indeed revealed a complex network of social relations that were regulated, at least in the community of the dead, by differences in age, gender, occupation, participation in warfare and achieved high status. Finally, Demircihöyük and its necropolis sit at the interface between western and central Anatolia, a position which is reflected in the mixed nature of the material culture at the site. While pottery manufacture, several object types and some funerary customs (extramural burials, the orientation of the deceased) point to traditions shared with in inland western Anatolia, other object types and funerary traits (including single inhumations, the co occurrence of pits, jars and cists and the 'chiefly' burials) point to strong connections with communities further east. Conclusions This paper has hopefully demonstrated that the quantita tive analysis of funerary datasets is a powerful tool with which to handle large quantities of data and to identify patterns that are, by their nature, not as clear-cut as we would like them to be. It also allows for the direct compar ison of similar archaeological contexts, and case studies like that of Demircihöyük-Sarıket, where a large and well published dataset is available, can be used as touchstones to integrate into the analysis situations where a similar data quality cannot be achieved, such as sites known only from old publications, sites with small excavated areas or sites with scarce archaeological recovery. The approach employed in this paper has shown that contextual analysis of funerary assemblages can produce good results in terms of understanding basic trends in the social organisation of past communities and can help develop an archaeological narrative, especially when integrated with data from nearby sites. And, lastly, even though burial contexts have their own peculiar biases, the analysis presented here further suggests they may in fact be able to provide a much more detailed picture of the social relations of a community than their respective settlements.
