Entered as second-class matter, October 2, at the Post Office at New Haven, Connecticut, under the Act of March 3, 1879. Twenty-two centuries ago a large number of Jews were living in Egypt, especially in Alexandria, where the Greek language was in common use. For purposes of religious instruction it was decided to translate the Hebrew Bible into Greek, the first translation of that Bible which had ever been made. Our information about the matter comes mainly from a letter written by an Alexandrian who called himself Aristeas, addressed to his brother Philocrates. Some scholars have asserted that Aristeas was a Greek who was interested in the antiquities of the Jewish people and who was a courtier in the service of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt from 285 to 246 B. C. That he was a Greek, however, is completely a matter of conjecture; and while he may have been an important employee of the king, there is no direct evidence that this was the case. All that we know is that he had access to the court. In any event, the letter tells of an embassy of which he was an important member. At the suggestion of Demetrius, the head of the famous library in Alexandria, this delegation had been sent by the king to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem with the request that six elders be appointed from each of the twelve tribes for the purpose of translating the Torah or Pentateuch into Greek. The translation, when completed, was to be deposited in the library. Eleazar complied with the request and appointed seventy-two elders, who proceeded to Egypt with "the parchments on which was inscribed the Torah in gold in Jewish characters."' After a royal banquet which lasted seven days and a quiz program of seventy-two wise questions and answers, the elders departed for a building specially prepared for them on the island of Pharos. There in precisely seventy-two days they completed the Greek translation. De- metrius then "assembled the Jewish people on the spot where the translation had been made and read it through to the whole assembly in the presence of the translators, who received another great ovation from the people ..." The work was then read to the king who "made obeisance and ordered that great care should be taken of the Books .. ."2 2Work on the remainder of the Hebrew Bible was completed at a somewhat later date. For some reason this translation came to be called "Seventy" or Septuagint (Latin Septuagintfa, often designated simply as LXX) rather than "Seventy-two" (Septuaginta et duo). Perhaps it was because of some popular association with the "seventy elders" of Exod. 24:1,9; or with the Sanhedrin of seventy; or with seventy apostles of Jesus (Lk. 10:1); or with some other such association." Here then is an authorized translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, the work of Jewish scholars. Furthermore, it was popular and widely used in Jewish circles until after the loss of the sovereign state in Palestine in</page><page sequence="3">1946, 2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 23 70-135 A. D. Then the unique translation into Greek by Aquila, in keeping with the exegesis current in the second century, replaced it among the Jews, until its use in the Synagogue was forbidden by the code of Justinian (555 A. D.). Its preservation was due to its widespread use in Christian commun- ities. By the end of the first century A. D. the Christian Church was largely composed of Gentiles, and a Greek translation of the Old Testament was imperative. Small wonder, then, that the Septuagint became the Bible of the Early Church, sometimes considered an even more inspired text than the original Hebrew! In the east it is still the official Bible of the Greek Orthodox Church, but among western Christians it was replaced after the fifth century by the Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome. As Professor Gehman pointed out in the December, 1945 number of this journal, it is an interesting fact that the oldest manuscripts of the Old Testament now extant are not in Hebrew, but are copies of the Septuagint. The two best known are both from the fourth century A. D.: Codex Vaticanus preserved in the Vatican Library in Rome, and Codex Sinaiticus which was found by Tischendorf in a monastery of Mt. Sinai nearly a century ago, and which is now in the British Museum. Within the last decade scholars have been agreeably surprised no less than three times by the appearance of important collections of earlier Greek manuscripts. The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri (ed. Kenyon) and The John H. Scheide Biblical Papyri. Ezek. (ed. Johnson, Gehman and Kase), all from one codex, date from the second or third centuries A. D. Two Biblical Papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester (ed. Roberts) are from the second century B. C., and from about the same time is the Fouad papyrus.4 This is important archaeological news, and one wonders what next will turn up! Now what is the importance of these discoveries? Obviously, since the Septuagint manuscripts are so much older than those we have of the Hebrew text, they should be of great value in the determination of the original text of the Hebrew Bible. But how is the Septuagint to be used? The average Biblical commentary of three or four decades ago was filled with a wealth of changes of the Hebrew text which were believed to be indicated and even demanded by the Septuagint. Yet archaeology, as the reader of The Biblical Archaeologist has learned, has helped considerably in revolu- tionizing our attitude toward the Bible. We are now less inclined to be skeptical of something merely because extra-Biblical data supporting it 1. On the problem of the characters in gold, see Jacob Leveen, The Hebrew Bible in Art, The Schweich Lectures for 1939 (London 1944), pp. 2 ff. The entire volume, dealing with a neglected subject, is well worth reading. 2. This was the traditional Jewish procedure in announcing an official and authoritative document, or in renewing its authority. So, for example, Moses and the Law (Ex. 24:1,7), Joshua and the Law (Josh. 8:34-5), Josiah and the Law (2 Kgs. 22:10, 23:1-2), Ezra and the Law (Neh. 8). The same procedure is evident, for example, in Jer. 36, 51:60-64. 3. It is commonly asserted that Septuaginta is but a shorter form of Septuaginta et duo, the latter being too long an expression for popular oral usage. There are a number of reasons why it is difficult to accept this explanation. I have been unable to discover other instances, either in Hellenistic-Roman or Jewish circles, where such a number as seventy-two was shortened simply because of oral convenience. It should also be noted that there is no evidence that this change occurred prior to the 2nd-3rd centuries A. D. (when the "seventy" of the Sanhedrin and of the Apostles, etc., were well known and in common oral usage). 4. See Journal of Theological Studies, 1945, pp. 159 f. For other important, though less sen- sational LXX finds, see Jewish Quarterly Review 32 (1941-2), pp. 89-90.</page><page sequence="4">24 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. IX, are lacking. Until demonstrated otherwise, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the credit side of the Biblical ledger. The same attitude is now being taken toward the reliability of the text of the Hebrew Bible in relation to that of the Septuagint. THE SEPTUAGINT AS A JEWISH WORK One difficulty in the past has been the failure to bear in mind the fact that the LXX is a Jewish work, with the result that an enormous amount of time and effort has been wasted in its unscientific use for the "elucida- tion" and "restoration" of the Hebrew text. We limit ourselves here to two examples: 1. The Hebrew Bible was read, studied and interpreted by the Jews during the Maccabean, Mishnic and Talmudic periods no less than it was before the second century B. C. and after the sixth century A. D. It is only reasonable to assume that where the LXX points, or appears to point, to a Hebrew reading which differs from that preserved in the Hebrew text currently in use, there may be involved, not two variants of which only one can be original, but one reading of which the LXX is simply an interpre- tation. And parallels to this interpretation should be sought in the vast literature which the Jews produced from the second century B. C. through the sixth century A. D., a literature which is a mine of information for the discerning scholar. It is the great contribution of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel of Dresden (1801-75) to one phase of correct LXX study that he collected and classified material of this kind, demonstrating the manner in which the LXX exhibits the kind of exegesis found in the Targumim, Mishnah, Tosefta, Midrashim, and Gemara. Had this important approach been kept in mind, many of the best known critics of the past generations would never have emended the preserved Hebrew text so recklessly and indiscriminately. 2. The Hebrew Bible was to the Jews a collection of sacred books. The Bible was translated into Greek precisely because the sacred Scriptures had to be made accessible to those Jews who no longer knew enough Hebrew to read the original. The Aramaic Targums, Saadia's Arabic translation, and the modern English version sponsored by the Jewish Publication Society were made for the same reasons. Is it reasonable to suppose that these same Jews willfully or negligently altered and corrupted their Hebrew Bible between the third century B. C. and the second century A. D. to the extent that the footnotes in the second and third editions of the most widely used critical edition today, Kittel's Biblia Hebraica, would indicate ?5 Should not scholars first have made an independent and thorough study, not only of the preserved Hebrew text of whatever book in the Bible they were commenting on, but also of the LXX ? Had they done so, they would not have abused the LXX so frequently and unjusti- fiably as to create from it a Hebrew text (Vorlage) which never existed outside their own imagination. There is surely something wrong with an approach to the LXX which has resulted in such far-reaching divergence between the preserved Hebrew text on the one hand and, on the other, the Hebrew text which is thought to be derived from the LXX.</page><page sequence="5">1946, 2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 25 THE CORRECT USE OF THE SEPTUAGINT The important question frequently heard is: But what is the correct way to handle the LXX in relation to the preserved Hebrew text? A brief answer will be attempted here, based upon the works of such important scholars as Lagarde, Rahlfs, Margolis, and Montgomery.6 There are available for study today hundreds of manuscripts of such relatively early translations as the Slavonic, Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Gothic, Greek, Latin, Bohairic, Sahidic, Syriac. From various sources we are well informed on the circumstances under which these translations came into being.7 From the chart presented in Fig. 6 it will -ioit; a:::::::::ii'l:'"':"?: ~a::: n::i:::j::::I::. :`i::::::: ::?:-::?:: ::??~:?- I %:::i:::r:~; i: ::::::::::::i:::i: :::a:: ?I:'i:_:::::;:: Fig. 2. Paul de Lagarde (1827-1891), the first scholar to have presented (in 1880) a scientific analysis of the problems involved in the attempt to recover the original LXX translation of the Hebrew Bible. be seen that some translations derive directly from the LXX while others, secondarily or directly, derive from a Hebrew text virtually identical with that preserved in hundreds of manuscripts of the Bible and in the printed editions in use the past four and one-half centuries. The Hebrew text 5. It is no exaggeration to assert that the critical apparatus in this edition of the Bible has become for some more sacred and authoritative than the Hebrew text itself. As S. R. Driver, the master textual critic, once wrote: "The best collection both of variants from the versions and conjectural emendations is that contained in Kittel's Biblia Hebraica. But in the acceptance of both variants and emendations, considerable discrimination must be exercised." Though the third edition is generally less misleading than the second, the student cannot be warned too strongly against accepting at its face value any variant or emendation in the critical apparatus (cf. the remarks in Jour. of Biblical Lit. 63, 1944, p. 33 and the references listed in note 18). 6.

The divergences between the two are in actuality comparatively few, and most of them are the obvious and usual kind of corruptions. For this reason it is impossible to assume that we are dealing with two independent Hebrew texts rather than with two offsprings of one parent text. The problems facing the textual critic become apparent when he finds that for the LXX he possesses not one Greek manuscript, but scores of Greek manuscripts each of which differs from the others to a greater or lesser extent. He is thus confronted at once by the task of determining which manuscript, or group of manuscripts, has preserved the original. Fig. 3.

Sketch by Richard C. Snyder, McCormick Seminary. Only after this has been determined is he ready to reconstruct the Hebrew original from which the LXX was translated and to compare it with the received Masoretic text. Let me describe briefly the way in which Margolis went about this exceedingly complex task in his important and monumental The Book of Joshua in Greek (Paris 1931-). 1. First he obtained photostatic copies, wherever possible, of all manu- scripts of all primary and secondary versions.8 2. He compared the secondary versions or translations of the LXX with the many Greek manuscripts representing the LXX. He compared the Greek manuscripts with each other and with the citations from these manuscripts in the writings of the Church Fathers. He chose Joshua of all the books in the Bible because it lent itself admirably to textual and</page><page sequence="7">1946, 2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 27 exegetical analysis and, what is of supreme importance, because it contained hundreds of proper names, the history of which in context could readily be traced. 3. Margolis described his method and results as follows:9 "The sum of the witnesses yield four principal recensions, P C S E, and in addition a number of MSS. variously mixed which I name M. At the outset it must be remarked that all of our witnes- ses are more or less mixed; the classification has in mind the basic character of a text, which alone is the determinant. P is the Pales- tinian recension spoken of by Jerome, that is the Eusebian edition of the Septuagint column in Origen's Hexapla-Tetrapla'O . . . C is a recension which was at home in Constantinople and Asia Minor.

By this means he was able to correct a number of mistakes in the generally accurate Brooke-McLean, Larger Cambridge Septuagint on Joshua: see his article in Jour. Biblical Lit. 49 (1930), pp. 234-64. 9. Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams (New York, 1927), pp. 307-23. 10. The Church Father Origen (185-254 A. D.), often called the first great scholar of the Early Church, undertook the task of recovering the original text of the LXX. He arranged the texts which hie wished to compare in six (and sometimes more) parallel columns. Column I contained the unvocalized Hebrew. Column 2 contained the vocalization of the Hebrew text of Column 1 in Greek letters. Column 3 contained Aquila's new translation of the Hebrew into Greek. Aquila was a Jewish proselyte of Pontus in Asia Minor; his translation was almost slavishly literal. In the fourth Column was a new Greek translation made by Symmachus, who was a member of the Ebionite Christian sect. In the fifth was the text of the LXX as revised by Origen to conform to Column 2. The sixth contained the version of Theodotion, an earlier revision of the LXX rather than a new translation. On the proposition that Origen meant this many columned Bible to serve as a textbook wherewith to learn Hebrew, see Orlinsky, Jewish Quart. Review 27 (1936-37), pp. 137-49. It is my own considered opinion, based on the use of the terms involved in the early patristic literature and marginal notes in manuscripts, that the Tetrapla was not a separate four- column work but only another term for the many columned "Hexapla" in which the four Greek columns of Aquila, Symmachus, Origen's revision of the LXX, and Theodotion were the all-important ones.</page><page sequence="8">28 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST Vol. IX, fourth recension; but then he is by no means exact, or the recension was at his time just in the process of formation ...

The critically restored text, as it appears on the top of the page in Margolis' edition of the Greek Joshua, "is the nearest approach to the Greek original as it left the hands of the translator(s)," and it is the trans- lation which the so-called Aristeas had in mind when he wrote his famous Letter. But what, it may be asked, is the student of the Bible to do in the absence of such a monumental work as that of Margolis on Joshua for other books in the Bible? The procedure is not easy, but, summarily put, it is as follows: 1. When the student finds himself disturbed by something in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible, be it a problem in grammar or meaning or interpretation or word or sentence order, he turns to the LXX, the oldest primary version. 2. As matters stand today, the student turns to the LXX as it is published in the convenient editions of Swete and Rahlfs. This means that he is turning to Codex Vaticanus (B) with an "apparatus" at the bottom of the page consisting of a very few select variants culled from a few other uncial manuscripts (that is, written in capital letters). The latter are most usually Codex Sinaiticus (S or Aleph) and Codex Alexandrinus (A). 3. Between 1798 and 1827 the Oxford Press published for the scholarly world an edition of the Greek Bible with variant readings by Holmes and Parsons (Vetus Testamentum Graecum cum Variis Lectionibus). Generally speaking this is quite reliable and it is still the greatest collection of variant readings from no less than three hundred eleven manuscripts and, in</page><page sequence="9">1946, 2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 29 Latin dress, from some secondary versions, including Old Latin, Coptic (Memphitic and Sahidic), Arabic, Slavonic, Armenian, and Georgian. Since 1906 the Cambridge Press has been publishing The Old Testament in Greek, by Brooke-McLean (Thackeray). This is popularly known as The Larger Cambridge Septuagint so as to distinguish it from Swete's edition of Codex Vaticanus published by the same Press. This work has a more select and reliable collection of variants, but it does not supplant the older work of Holmes and Parsons. The latter contains considerable material which is not accessible elsewhere and which should be republished so as to make it available. The student must examine carefully, not only Codex Vaticanus and the other main uncials, but also whatever variants there may be as recorded in the apparatus of Holmes-Parsons and Brooke-McLean, whether in the LXX manuscripts or in the daughter versions.12 .: ? ? : . -? ... ...?.- ? ...-?

This, one of our greatest uncial manuscripts, was found by Tischendorf in the monastery on Mt. Sinai in 1844 (the first leafs) and in 1859 (the remainder). It was a Bible used by Christians, as it contains both the Old and New Testaments. It is dated c. 350 B. C. (From Milne and Skeat, Scribes and Correctors of the Codex Sinaiticus, London, British Museum, 1938, Fig. 1 upper.) 4. Before it is possible to determine the original LXX reading, the student must make a careful analysis of the character of the LXX transla- tion of the entire book of which his troublesome reading is a part. Only after he has learned to know and to "feel" the stylistic, lexical, exegetical, 11. It is of the greatest significance that Prof. Montgomery, working independently on the Book of Daniel, found that Margolis' conclusions regarding Joshua hold true for this book also. For the important work of Prof. Gehman in this field see reference listed in n. 6, p. 84 (n.9). 12. This is a very important matter, and no one has been emphasizing it more frequently and emphatically in recent years than Prof. Montgomery. In his Daniel (p. 40) he wrote: ".. scholars have perpetrated the mistake of baldly citing B (Codex Vaticanus) as though it were ultimate, with no attempt to criticise it apart from its group and to recover the original text." He points to a number of manuscripts which aid in correcting Codex Vaticanus. See also Jour. Bib. Lit. 55 (1936), pp. 309 ff. and Jour. Am. Or. Soc. 59 (1939), pp. 262 ff. where he criticises Kenyon (editor of the Chester Beatty Papyri), Roberts (who edited the Rylands Papyri), and some of the editors of the Scheide Papyri, because they compared their newly discovered material with only two or three selected uncials. Prof. Gehman deserves our thanks for the basic work he has been doing in analyzing such daughter versions as the Arabic, Armenian and Ethiopic.</page><page sequence="10">3( -,- &gt;w.

If the student finds it impossible to explain the LXX reading in the light of the reading preserved in the Hebrew text,13 then he must try to find a solution which at one and the same time explains both the LXX reading and that preserved in the Hebrew text. Unless a proposed emendation satisfies these requirements, it may exhibit nothing more than the ingenuity of the critic.14 Incidentally, there is an importance in LXX study which has long been noted but which, for lack of proper method, has not yet been worked out satisfactorily in detail. That is the determination of the kind of alphabet in which the Hebrew manuscripts used by the various LXX translators were written. This is important, not only for textual criticism, but also for the history of the Hebrew alphabet. There are two ways of attacking the problem, and they may be combined or also used separately as a check on one another. The first consists in a careful study of the scripts used in and around Palestine during, or not too far removed, from the time when the LXX translation was made. The second consists of a careful analysis of the LXX, especially of its points of disagreement with the Masoretic text, in order to determine from the character of the letters involved the kind of script which must have been employed. If this script resembles one which we know to have been in use between the fourth and first centuries B. C. in the region of Palestine-Egypt, then we are on fairly safe ground. Both of these approaches have been attempted in the past, though rather sporadically. When the attempts ended with no positive results or with obviously incorrect conclusions, we may probably infer that the failures were occasioned (1) by an insufficient number of inscriptions which could be used as a basis of comparison, and (2) by an improper methodology which reconstructed a Hebrew alphabet behind the LXX composed of an absurd concoction of letters which never existed in one and the same period. Today, with much more information available, there is good reason to believe that the alphabet of the Hebrew manuscripts used by the LXX translators was somewhere between that of the Lachish letters (written just before the fall of that city in 587 B. C.) and that of the Nash papyrus of the second or first century B. C.15 My own studies have convinced me that while many of the letters in the alphabet of the Hebrew manuscripts behind the LXX have nothing in common in appearance, yet they could more easily be confused in the square script which came into use after the LXX translation had been made (virtually identical with the script now used in Hebrew Bibles). It need scarcely be pointed out that the 13. Or in the light of variant readings preserved in such great collections of variants in Hebrew manuscripts as those of Kennicott, Vetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum Variis Lectionibus (2 vols., Oxford 1776, 1780) and de Rossi, Variae Lectiones Veteris Testamenti (4 vols. and Supplement, Parma 1784-98). 14. Since this section is of necessity only general in character, its usefulness may perhaps be enhanced by referring directly to some articles where the method here described is applied to specific texts: Jewish Quart.

As implied in what has already been written, even the most cursory reading of the LXX makes it evident that the different books were trans- lated by different scholars or committees of scholars. Thus there are different styles, vocabularies, and degrees of literalness in the Greek version of the first five books, and between them and Job, for example. It needs to be emphasized, therefore, that these differences among the translators make it imperative for the textual critic to study the entire LXX book before he can use some one translation for the purpose of clarifying the Hebrew. Yet it must be admitted that this has not often been done. There are scarcely ten books which can be singled out as models of what LXX study ought to be. One thinks at once of the following: Wellhausen, Der Text der Buecher Samuelis (1871); Cornill, Ezechiel (1886; though his emendations are too often a bit arbitrary) ; S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel (2nd ed. 1913; a work which is un- excelled); Rahlfs, Septuaginta-Studien (1904-11; studies in the Books of Kings and Psalms) and Das Buchl Ruth griechisch (1922); Dhorme, Le Livre de Job (1926); J. A. Montgomery's model Daniel (1927) and his forthcoming Kings in the International Critical Commentary; Margolis, The Book of Joshua in Greek (1931-) : After listing the above, one begins to experience increasing difficulty in calling to mind others of comparable character. Too many commentators have arrived at inadequate textual and exegetical conclusions after a glance at Codex Vaticanus in the editions of Swete or Rahlfs. OTHER PHASES OF SEPTUAGINT STUDY Before closing this brief survey of the study of the LXX, one should call attention to a few other matters of concern to the Biblical scholar. 1. There are hundreds of instances in the Bible where God is described in anthropomorphic terms, as though he had a body with hands, nose, eyes, mouth, etc.; or in anthropopathic terms, as though he had human emotions, became angry, jealous, vengeful, etc.; or as though he were merciless, making man a target for his arrows, etc. (for example, in the Book of Job). The Israelites scarcely thought of their God as having human form or emotions, yet neither did they shrink from using the terminology ordinarily used for human beings to describe and make real the activity of God. Later in a more sophisticated and prudish society people began to avoid this type of language. For the "hand" of God they used the word "power;" for "in the eyes" of God, the phrase "in the presence" of God; for "the mouth" of God, "the word" of God or even "Word"; etc. This is true occasionally in the Hebrew Bible itself, but it is especially evident in the Targums, in early rabbinic literature, and in the writings of the Church Fathers. It has long been assumed that the LXX too modified and even suppressed these anthropomorphisms, and special studies of this subject have been published. Yet my own work has led me to the conclusion that</page><page sequence="13">1946, 2 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 33 the translators of the LXX did far less of this sort of thing than is commonly assumed. The translator of Job, for example, more than all the other LXX translators put together, has been accused of suppressing and skirting around those passages where God is described as though He were a human being, or where it is taken for granted (not argued!) that there is no afterlife for either the just or the wicked apart from the eternal and colorless existence in Sheol. Yet strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that no LXX translator was more careful and faithful in his attempt to reproduce in Greek these concepts of the Hebrew original. The situation is no different in the Pentateuch.16 In other words, whatever theological beliefs the LXX translators of the Pentateuch and Job held, they did not resort to antianthropomorphic or euphemistic tricks, but reproduced their Hebrew manuscripts faithfully. 2. One of the great values of the LXX lies in the aid it furnishes the student of Hebrew grammar, though linguists have only begun to use it for this purpose. In the attempt to reconstruct the grammar of Biblical Hebrew numerous problems arise in phonology, morphology, and syntax. For the last two the LXX, properly used, may be of considerable value. The LXX is also important for the study of Hebrew semantics (the study of the meaning and development of words). Mention should also be made of the value of the second column of Origen's Hexapla (that is, the Hebrew text of the first column vocalized in Greek characters) for the phonology and morphology of Biblical Hebrew in the Intertestamental Period. 3. Of interest and value in the textual criticism of both the Hebrew and Greek texts is the width of the columns in the rolls and codices.17 It is obvious that if we knew how many letters filled the average line we should be in a much better position to apply in our canons of textual criticism the principles of vertical dittography and haplography, which are concerned with words incorrectly introduced or omitted in a line or two above or below the proper line. Similarly, we could the better apply the principles of homoioarkton and homoioteleuton, which are concerned with lines which fall out when the line above or below begins (arkton) or ends (teleuton) with the same (homoio) letter or combination of letters. In the course of an article four years ago I attempted to deal with some textual corruptions which in turn pointed to lines of about 11-14 letters in length and to lines twice this length.1i The general argument and conclusions were the same for both the Hebrew and for the earliest editions of the LXX. Until more work is done along these lines, however, and until earlier manuscripts are discovered, our conclusions can be regarded only as tentative. 16. For some details, see Jewish Quart. Review 28 (1937-8), pp. 63-4 and nn. 26-7; Crozer Quarterly 21 (1944), pp. 156-60. 17. See now the facinating and instructive discussions by C. C. McCown on "Codex and Roll in the new Testament' (Harvard Theological Rev. 34, 1941, pp. 219-50) and "The Earliest Christian Books" (B. A. 6, 1943, pp. 21-31). 18. Jour. Bib.

It was once thought that the Greek language of the LXX never really existed in the mouths of the people, but that it was essentially artificial in origin. We now know better, thanks to the discovery of a large and ever increasing mass of contemporary writings which was brought so vividly to the attention of the older generation of Biblical scholars by Deissman in his Licht von Osten (1908), translated into English with the title, Light from the Ancient East. Unfortunately, the Old Testament scholar has not followed his New Testament colleague in the study of the Greek material uncovered and published during the last few decades in so far as it bears on the LXX. What H. G. Meecham has done for the Greek of The Letter of Aristeas in a book published in 1935 remains to be done for the LXX, though Joseph Ziegler has made an excellent beginning in his study of the LXX of Isaiah. It is The Old Testament scholar who must do this, because the scholar who comes to the task from the field of classical studies lacks the specialized training which is necessary for the proper treatment of Biblical Hebrew and Greek. The treatment of the Chester Beatty and Rylands papyri by their Hellenistic editors is, unfortunately, somewhat misleading in places for this reason. These remarks, it is hoped, may indicate something of the tremendous amount of significant and useful work yet to be done in the analysis of the most important translation of the Old Testament which has ever been made, the Septuagint, together with its daughter versions.</page></plain_text>
