<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biblical Biblical Myth and Rabbinic Mythmaking. By MICHAEL F1SHBANE. Pp. xiv + 459. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. ISBN ο !9 826733 g. £70. ARE the myths about primeval sea monsters, divine warriors, and weather gods, as preserved in the Hebrew Bible, unalterably polytheistic in character and therefore incompatible with Jewish monotheism? Is Jewish religious thought therefore required to view them figuratively or as reflections of linguistic inade quacy? May it justifiably be maintained that their equivalents in rabbinic literature are 'merely faded fragments of non-Jewish antiquity and devoid of any real mythic valence' (p. 9)? Is the vigorous mythic reality of the medieval Zohar a wholly new birth for mother Judaism? The Nathan Cummings Professor of Jewish Studies and Chair of the Committee on Jewish Studies at the University of Chicago is convinced that the responses to such questions have to be in the negative and has devoted many years of thought, research, and discussion to composing a volume in which he offers the documentation and argumentation necessary to support his conviction. With an admirable reputation for studies of quality on the Jewish</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 625 exegesis of the Hebrew Bible through Jewish history, as exemplified in his magisterial Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel Israel (Oxford, 1985), Fishbane is one of those scholars best qualified to tackle a topic that covers nearly two thousand years of religious and literary history and he does not here shirk any aspects of the indomitable challenge that such a task represents. The introduction notes the difference between the Greek terms mythos and logos, accepts broadly established scholarly definitions of the concept of myth, and explains why the author rejects the notion that myth is foreign to monotheism and Judaism. He understands 'Myth' to refer to the accounts of the deeds and personalities of the gods and heroes or the under standing of them in later forms of a given culture and sets the tone for the remainder of the study by arguing that what we have in Jewish tradition is a 'cultural sequence... rooted in the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic imagery of Scripture ... developed and intensified by its midrashic and kabbalistic inheritors, who also received the mythic figures of antiquity and extended them through bold and innovative exegetical strategies' (p. 11). His main contentions are that in the Jewish religious tradition monotheism and myth are not mutually exclusive or incompatible and that myths are a positive and vital feature of its vast monotheistic literature. Also included in his introduction is an explanation of his methodology and a preview of the nature of his treatment of the biblical, rabbinic, and medieval sources. What is promised—a promise that is indeed kept—is no less than a literary, typological, and comparative analysis; an appreciation of religious and historical contexts; an explanation of the process of exegesis and reuse; and an account of the variety of genres and their continuing metamorphosis. The overall themes to be pursued by way of exemplification are divine combat, divine wrath and sorrow, and the sympathetic identification of the divine and human realms. The first part of the study is devoted to the biblical myths, to their Near Eastern context, and to the identification of logos and agon models. Examples are offered of the incorporation of combat myths and divine actions into psalms and prophetic passages, as well as of their personalization and historicization in the characters and events of the Hebrew Bible. Fishbane identifies a fourfold hierarchy of powers ranging from God and his divine host, through the earthly realm, and into the nether world, and explains their relationship with the mythic in biblical Israel's view of the universe. He concludes that the 'relationship between myth and tradition is thus part of the living dynamics</page><page sequence="3">626 REVIEWS of traditum and traditio, as materials are received, revised, revivified, and reformulated' (p. 92). An ongoing and mythic creativity had to await the develop ment of rabbinic Judaism and it is rabbinic myth and myth making, which included material from the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Near East, Graeco-Roman Palestine, Sassanian Babylonia, and oral tradition, that are the subject of the volume's second and most substantial part. The further development of the mythic process was achieved by way of new methods that included aetiological interpretation, theological evaluation, etymology, textual comparison, concretization, and personification. Though grounded in the language of Scripture, rabbinic interpretation was also inventive and fluid, and mythic teachings were elevated to the level of midrash. Among the topics covered are the Egyptian bondage and its aftermath, the Temple's destruction and people's exile to Babylon, and the redemptive restoration to the homeland, as well as their meaning for the Roman conquest, the new diaspora, and the relationship between Israel and God. Among the broader mythic themes that are treated in the texts are God and the primordial waters (such as Tehom and Okeanos), participation and pathos (including the dwelling of the Shekhinah), and manifestations of the divine character and names. What emerges from the rabbinic midrashim is that there is both continuity and innovation. The myths in all their variety are located as elements of tradition, themselves to be studied, understood, and transmitted via the academies and synagogues of the land of Israel and the Babylonian diaspora, through literary innovations and compositions, and by means of the revolutionary religious poetry of the late Roman and early Byzantine periods concerning primeval, historical, and eschato logical times. Although the mythic content may often be based on Scripture, it is commonly the case that the two tiers of language, the scriptural and the midrashic, are dramatically different. Sometimes the linguistic attachment is through exegesis, at other times by way of metaphor. The mythic images of God's manifestations are potentially misleading, the power to imagine God in human terms is itself a God-given facility, and the divine being is not static but dynamically engaged with Israel. With regard to what Fishbane designates as the 'divine pleroma', some midrashic accounts 'attest to a mythic realm above and beyond history, and anticipate theoso phical aspects of the metastatic structure of Divinity found in a host of medieval Jewish texts and tracts' (p. 242).</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 627 It is such texts and tracts, under the heading of 'Jewish Myth and Mythmaking in the Middle Ages', that are the subject of Part III of Fishbane's study. Unlike those who concentrated on the simple sense of Scripture, mystical works such as the SeferSefer Bahir of twelfth-century Provence, and the comments of R. Azriel of thirteenth-century Gerona, affirmed the existence within it of a sacred code of higher mysteries. Fishbane here treats as his central topic the manifestation and mystery of the Zohar in mid-thirteenth-century Castile, 'a vast inventory of mythic themes and topics' (p. 267), with a creative spirit and bold imagination. The themes discussed include the primordial serpent and the secrets of creation, the mystery of evil, and other cosmogonies, and the author points to some remarkable parallels with Gnostic myths from late antiquity preserved by the Church Fathers. There is also a discussion of the dramatic crisis in the celestial realms caused by the loss of the Jerusalem Temple and the Jews' exile from their homeland and the desire 'within the holy hierarchy of the Godhead for the restoration of its desecrated or fragmented unity' (p. 296). The conclusion is that such mystical traditions continue earlier myths and their interpretation but, additionally, attempt to uncover the hidden myths contained in the words of the Torah, especially as they relate to the nature of the divinity and its relationship with Israel. They thus go very much beyond the earlier biblical and midrashic interpretations in attempting to understand the full diversity of existence and thus to understand the very nature of divinity. In the final chapter, Fishbane summarizes his conclusions and one of his statements amounts to a useful and far-reaching precis of a central part of his overall thesis: 'The three literary corpora that have been investigated provide different accounts or percep tions of what we may call the theosphere and its relation to the biosphere. The correlations between these divine and earthly dimensions dimensions of reality provide an index to the nature of myth recorded in these cultural strata' (p. 309). This is followed by a first appendix containing translations of passages from talmudic and zoharic sources that are central to the whole discussion and a second that deals with the midrashic term kivyakhol and its uses and that is a study of virtually monographic length. Making use of classical and rabbinic sources in published and critical editions as well as in manuscript codices and Genizah fragments, and offering a detailed identification and analysis of the different usages, Fishbane concludes that the term 'marks a presumptive possibility of meaning ("as in/by the</page><page sequence="5">628 REVIEWS possibility"): when incorporated into the theologoumenon, it qualifies that assertion insofar as it is based upon an exegetical possibility presumed of the cited Scripture; and when it precedes the proof-text, the term indicates that the preceding theological assertion is based upon an exegetical presumption concerning the cited Scripture's plain sense' (p. 399). In sum, this volume provides close and careful examinations of a rich variety of texts, thoughtful summaries of what may be concluded with regard to each type of literature, two innovative appendices, and a number of detailed indexes. The author combines a broad knowledge of religious phenomenology, the theory of myth, and the classical and Christian traditions with a specialized, masterly, and detailed understanding of biblical, rabbinic, and kabbalistic texts and traditions. He presents the reader with a vast amount of text to absorb and an extensive number of interpretations and conclusions on which to reflect. His volume is not recommended for anyone seeking an easy read, simple explanations, and glib conclusions, but is a work of sound and solid scholarship. Its interpretations and conclusions will long remain the subject of much discussion. How central and normative, for instance, is the mythic tradition in the totality of the Jewish religious tradition? Is there a folkloristic as well as a mythic element to the rabbinic use of such sources? What precisely is the link between the mythical and the mystical? Whatever the nature of such debate, there will be broad acknowledgement that it will be unable to proceed without direct reference to this truly outstanding and exceptionally important piece of research. doi: 10.1093/jts/flil 60 Stefan C.
