<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 635 Cartesian Metaphysics: the Scholastic Origins of Modem Philosophy. By JORGE SECADA. (Cambridge UP, 2000. Pp. xii + 333. Price ?37-50.) 'I should like to explain', Descartes wrote to Henricus Regius in January 1642, 'in what way automata are also works of nature and how it is that men, in making them, do nothing other than apply activity to what is passive, as they also do when they sow wheat or when they breed mules - which does not bring about any essential difference, but only such as are laid down by nature'. Art and nature did not stand as far apart as Aristotle had taught. According to Descartes, human artefacts such as watches, or, we might say, computers, are no less 'physical' than works of nature. To put it the other way round, natural bodies are no less 'mechanical' than artefacts. Today we are inclined to explain Descartes' position in different terms. A modern neuroscientist would say that natural bodies are no less 'physical' than automata. This way of expressing it, however, would be out of context in the seventeenth century. The traditional position was that 'mechanics' was the science of artefacts, and that 'physics' dealt with natural objects - with things, that is, which were thought to have an individual essence by nature and a natural 'principle' of self-movement. Descartes' letter to Regius indicates that Descartes was fully aware of the fact that his philosophy denied the common sense distinction between what is natural and what is man-made. It also shows us that he clearly saw the anti-essentialist con- sequences of his new philosophy. With no slight sense of humour, Descartes comes up with the example of the mule - the animal, that is, with which Scholastic authors had always had serious problems. They debated whether mules were 'natural', whether it was legitimate to breed them, and whether God had or had not created them within the first six days. Such problems were soon to evaporate. The 'essence of the mule' was no longer a problem once philosophy accepted a 'mechanical' interpretation of physics. The immediate success of the mechanical philosophy was to a considerable extent due to the immense creativity of Descartes' scientific imagination. Although none of his explanations would ultimately stand the test of time, many Europeans still regarded Principia Philosophiae as the Bible of physics even after Newton had come up with his alternative set of nincipia. Descartes offered a refreshingly new approach to scientific problems. Arguing that every natural process could be ex- plained by the local motion of an inert, continuous, indefinitely extended and infinitely divisible matter, he provided new interpretations of a great variety of phenomena: from sunspots to tides, from raindrops to magnetism. For the first time in history, a detailed account was given of the possible behaviour of matter in pro- cesses which are inaccessible to our senses. The impression it made on the republic of letters was overwhelming. Unlike the average high-school student today, seventeenth-century scholars had never experienced the intellectual fascination of representing nature in corpuscular terms. Although the idea had been implied in Kepler's account of light as rays falling on the retina and Beeckman's and Galileo's explanations of the mechanical propagation of sound and other qualities, it was ?

It was Descartes as well who immediately saw the metaphysical implications of 'mechanism'. If the world is one gigantic machine, our experience of it will have to be something totally different. Descartes' dualism, by which 'the mental' was banished from science, was part and parcel of his natural philosophy. Moreover, if the universe was like a machine, this would mean the end of individual bodily 'substances', 'natures' and 'forms'. The anthropomorphic projection of 'substance' onto the world of individual objects was something Descartes' Aristotelian ad- versaries were most eager to defend. Yet the idea would be abandoned within a few generations. Along with substantial forms, 'essences' of natural things were also abandoned. In his recent book on Cartesian Metaphysics, Jorge Secada has nevertheless pro- posed to recreate Descartes as an 'essentialist'. The main reason for doing so is that in 'the Aristotelian science of the Scholastics', the existence of individual things prefigures their classification into 'essentially defined species' (p. 13). Descartes is said to work the other way round: starting from a diversity of substances (viz the mental and the physical), he deduces what types of things exist. This would make the Aristotelians 'existentialists', and Descartes an 'essentialist'. I do not like this idea. Indeed, I do not believe that such categorizations are helpful to our understanding of authors if they themselves never used these labels. Secada has interesting things to say about Descartes' nominalistic (or Suirezian) view that the distinction between the essence and the existence of an existing thing is merely a distinction of reason (pp. 215ff.). This in itself is enough to show that the notions of 'essence' and 'existence' are too broad to allow for a single issue on which a philosopher could be either an 'existentialist' or an 'essentialist'. Descartes, moreover, does not emerge as an 'essentialist' at all in this particular context. More important, however, is the fact that Secada's distinction between 'existen- tialist' and 'essentialist' types of reasoning obscures the reasons Descartes himself had for distinguishing between the mental and the physical. 'What are the grounds for Cartesian dualism?' Secada asks himself on p. 237. 'And why did Descartes claim that extension and [thought] are, for all we know, the only possible essences of created substance?' Arguing that Descartes was an 'essentialist' will never give us the answer to this, but will only strengthen the idea that he simply decided to be so. Descartes was indeed convinced that through our intellectual faculty we may have ideas which are not to be identified with the abstract images of things formed by the faculty of the imagination. In this sense, Secada rightly argues that 'in forming a universal the intellect relates to many things "an idea which is itself singular"' (p. 125). Descartes accordingly opposed both SuArez' and Gassendi's views on this point. One might call him a 'Platonist' for doing so, rather than an 'essentialist', but what should in any case be clear is that Descartes does not thereby argue for the existence of a stock of innate ideas of essences within the mind. What is 'innate' is our ability to see that the idea of a triangle is not this or that imaginable triangle, and that there are ideas of a variety of 'thoughts' which, contrary to all ideas concerning extension, are not imaginable at all. ?

Cambridge University Press recommends Secada's book as being 'the first book-length study of Descartes' metaphysics to place it in its immediate historical context'. To my mind, however, there is actually too much conceptual analysis in this book and too little historical context. Erasmus University, Rotterdam HAN VAN RULER Problems from Kant. By JAMES VAN CLEVE. (Oxford UP, 1999. Pp. xii + 340. Price ?37.50.) The title of this book is accurate, well judged and directly to the point, like the book itself. Problems from Kant focuses on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, except for discussions of incongruous counterparts and of some recent philosophical work that one might think closely related to Kant's concerns (notably the 'irrealist' views of Putnam and Dummett). Van Cleve has not written a full-blown commentary. Rather he takes up a range of key topics, including the analytic/synthetic distinction, the ideality of space and time, aspects of Kant's argumentation in the Transcendental Deduction and the Paralogisms, and his treatment of arguments for the existence of God. There are also discussions of the First Analogy, the Second Analogy and the Second Antinomy, which supersede some of the author's earlier well known work. In addition, Van Cleve develops a sophisticated 'two-worlds' interpretation of Kant's transcendental idealism, which runs through and unifies the book. A brief characterization of Van Cleve's approach may be useful. Typically he begins the consideration of an issue by marshalling some essential relevant passages from the Critique. He then meticulously distinguishes a range of positions Kant might hold, or a range of arguments he might be deploying. (For example, in ch. 7 Van Cleve considers eight different interpretations of what Kant means by 'experience' and eight ways of understanding what 'transcendental unity of apperception' might be.) The various alternatives are assessed on the basis of their philosophical cogency and their coherence with Kantian doctrine. Van Cleve's treatment of Kant is devoid of pretension, but extraordinary in its clarity and acuity. It would be impossible to summarize his work in any way that could do it justice. In the following, I shall concentrate on what Van Cleve says about transcendental idealism, noting a few points at which one might challenge or diverge from his views. Van Cleve raises some significant difficulties for the 'one-world' interpretation of transcendental idealism, associated with scholars such as Graham Bird, H.E. Matthews, Lewis White Beck, Gerold Prauss and Henry Allison. One variant of this approach takes the distinction between appearances and things-in-themselves to be essentially an epistemological one: there are some aspects of reality that we can experi- ence and know, while there may be others we cannot. Van Cleve claims that this view entails a Leibnizian doctrine Kant rejects, namely, that knowledge of appear- ances is (deficient) knowledge of things-in-themselves (p. 146). But, according to Van Cleve, that is hardly the worst of it. The one-world view is ultimately incoherent; if C The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2002</page></plain_text>
