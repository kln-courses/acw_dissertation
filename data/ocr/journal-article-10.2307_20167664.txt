<plain_text><page sequence="1">The modality of time-maps Quilting in the Pacific from another point of view SUSANNE K?CHLER The association of the quilt with memory, protection, and the sustenance of connections hidden from plain view has inspired generations of scholars and practitioners. Quilting patterns and stitches, such as those of the African American quilts used in the struggle for freedom by enslaved blacks who travelled along the underground railroad, are known to enable people to navigate both time and space as emotionally charged ideas are crafted into absorbent cloth (Tobin and Dobard 1999). This article presents a perspective on Eastern Polynesian quilts that invite us to think about what such patterning may do in contexts where quilts are made as gifts to secure and refashion relationships, enabling us perhaps to move a little closer to understanding how quilts can be maps. Inspired by fiber-based techniques of latticework, the fabric quilts of the Pacific have emerged as key loci of the tacit knowledge of genealogy, mapping temporal relations in ways that do not resonate with cultural meanings as much as with logical reasoning that is applied whenever attachments are made and contested in the real world. Overtly it is the biography of the maker that is traced in the stitched patterns of the large and elaborate appliqu? and piecework quilts known as tivaevae, tifaifai, and kapa lau. Quilts generically known today as tivaivai are produced by women in the Cook Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, the Society Islands, and elsewhere in Eastern Polynesia, where they both substituted for barkcloth and mats and are used in ways deeply invested in the context of Christian domesticity, which arrived in this part of the Pacific with Presbyterian missionaries in the nineteenth century. For the purpose of clarity, the focus will be narrowed to the visual appearance of the Cook Island quilt, for it is here that diasporic demands, a Christian concern with time keeping and domesticity, and an existing tradition of fashioning genealogical markers have created a vibrant visual culture. Stored folded in treasure boxes, quilts here and elsewhere in Eastern Polynesia are the tangible reminders of relationships that are considered integral to a person. Externalized by women who shred and re stitch fabric into patterns, the quilts bring to the fore an understanding of social relationships in which a plurality of relations is transformed into a singular body. Much has been written about 'fractal personhood' in the Pacific where typical "Western" oppositions between individual and society, parts and wholes, singular and plural do not apply, and yet how people navigate themselves through such a complex web of possible worlds has remained a rarely asked question (Strathern 1988; Wagner 1991; Gell 1998). Quilts in the Pacific are pivotal to such matters of navigation as they are stitched to be given away at funerals, weddings, and other events marking stages of loss and severance in the life of a person, only to ultimately return to the grave of the maker. It is a well-known fact that, today in the Pacific, the Eastern Polynesian quilt assumes a central position in gift exchange where it in large part has replaced both mats and barkcloth (cf. Hammond 1986, Weiner 1994). In this article, I propose a perspective that will take us a step forward in understanding the relations quilting patterns make visible in ways that render them more effective than artifacts made of fiber. By turning to the quilt and considering the patterns that appear in non random variations, I show that quilts resonate with "a genealogical theory of mind" that probes for connections where we may expect the distinctive traits of a biography. Like a fractal person, a Polynesian quilt is an entity with relationships integrally implied in the ways motifs are serially enchained, "budding" out of one another in a depiction of human life. Constructed from layers of crisscrossing strips of fabric that are cut and stitched into regular, crystalline patterns on a plane, Polynesian quilts present the temporal equivalent of a spatial map in the form of a lattice of possible worlds. Contrary to the tendency to regard quilts as leftovers of a Pacific colonial past, we may instead understand their enduring popularity in terms of their ability to chart visually and materially a fractal vision of biography, and Research for this paper was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of Great Britain (R000 23 91 98) and was conducted as part of the project "Clothing the Pacific: The Study of the Nature of Innovation."</page><page sequence="2">180 RES 47 SPRING 2005 to make the charting of the path between possible past, present, and future worlds comprehensible in ways that overcome the oppositions laid down by the homogenizing forces of globalization. Indeed, the reexamination of quilting patterns as time-maps may allow us to understand why quilting has emerged as one of the most successful metaphors of nationhood in the Pacific today. Mapping in the Pacific What is represented in a time-map, as Alfred Gell (1992:242) reminded us, is not a unique or fixed complement of states of affairs. Time-maps do not chart single worlds, but networks of possible worlds; for just like spatial cognition, temporal cognition has a logic by which it maps the paths that lead from one possible world to another. Nowhere else may the practical significance of mapping relations be more important to people as in the Pacific where a constellation of island communities are dotted across the ocean expanse, covering over one-third of the world's surface area (Brookfield and Hart 1971), while its total land mass, once Australia is excluded, equals less than one-eighth of Europe. An example of a typical island community in the Pacific is that of the Cook Islands, a group of sixteen tiny islands and atolls, of which thirteen are inhabited, dotted in an area the size of Europe. The islands and atolls are so small that they can generally be crossed on foot in less than two hours, and most of them rise no more than ten meters above the surrounding water. Despite their lack of proximity, the people who inhabit these island communities are culturally and linguistically linked, and are known to have had longstanding and extensive trade and kinship connections with other even more remote island communities, such as the Society Islands some two thousand miles to the northeast. In this environment, water is the predominant feature and resource, and is a pathway along which people, their produce, and ideas can travel. In a world dominated by the ocean, like the Pacific, it is not surprising that spatial mapping and artifacts of navigation have attracted a good deal of attention from anthropology and related disciplines (Gell 1985; Silverman 1998; Ascher 2002). One of the most famous examples of artifacts that serve to map space are the stick-charts of the Marshall Islanders in Micronesia, which depict, with a geometric arrangement of sticks and shells, the interplay of oc?anographie phenomena and land masses. The islanders deploy an idealized version of the map, called mattang, which charts shapes and motions in the sea and at the land/sea interface. This idealized map serves as an explanatory model of the logic of topology which enables one to transfer the understanding derived from the model to the spatial relations between sea and land that are known through experience (Ascher 2002:97) The mattangfs idealized geometry of swell interactions are then translated into other stick-charts, called meddo, the lines and curves of which visualize the actual result of the wind and sea interaction in and around a group of real atolls (which vary in size, shape, and underwater topography). J?rg Wassmann (1994) has pointed to the theoretical significance of similar Pacific artifacts which, like the stick-charts of Micronesian seafarers, direct attention to a topological conception of space that visualizes possible transformations of continuous surfaces rather than mapping an ego-centered, anthropomorphic, and relative spatial conception. Like the stick charts of the Marshall Islanders, ritual artifacts in the Pacific call upon us to revise our conception of time and space within a surface/depth model that takes the anthropomorphic figure of man as its starting point (Kingston 2003). Rather than representing spatial relations from a particular ego centered vantage point, Pacific representations of space and time chart possible transformations in the continuous surface of two quite distinct media: that of cordage and that of lattice. Elsewhere (K?chler 2003) I have argued for the pivotal importance of cordage as a medium for transformational imagery that is uniquely capable of mapping topological conceptions of space and time as links in a chain. The most famous example of the ritual significance of cordage is the Hawaiian sacred cord ('aha) which has also traditionally acted as a reference point for genealogy?representing not only the king's relationship with the gods, but also the connecting force that "binds together all other genealogies," as it is the reference point of genealogical connectedness and the locus of its legitimacy and truth, described by the anthropologist Valerio Valeri (1985) in his now classic Kingship and Sacrifice in Hawaii. The binding of the cord as the core of the Hawaiian body politic resonates across the Pacific, and casts a shadow from the precolonial Pacific into the new world. From the ancient Tahitian knotted staff god (to'o) to the Fijian spirit house (bure kalou) or the woven malanggan figure (warwara), cordage was key to transformational techniques of mapping without being articulated everywhere in the same manner (Babadzan 1993;</page><page sequence="3">K?chler: The modality of time-maps 181 K?chler 2002; Rochette 2003). These examples of cordage-based ritual imagery point to the significance of cordage as a means of linking, through acts of binding and untying, that which is experienced as existing in the separate temporal and spatial domains of the world of the living and the world of the dead. In fact, it is the temporal logic of binding that carried the transformational capacity of spatial thinking. Cordage was thus a key material metaphor across the precolonial Pacific, as it resurfaced at those key moments in body politics when ideas of renewal came to the fore. A great number of images existed, each owned by a family, a bloodline, a clan, a district, or even a whole island. By ordering these images according to size, the correlation between the ranked polity of images and social rank was given regular and formal expression in ritual. Corporate clan unity, in contrast to the abstract idea of kingship and immortality, was represented in the planar surface of containers plaited from plant fiber into latticework designs. While cordage can be extended, in principle infinitely, and requires a prior plan for proper execution, the shape and size of the surface of latticework depends on the constituent plant, such as the size of the leaf, either coconut or pandanus, from which a lattice-frame was produced, and on a distinctive bodily involvement with the product. The precise figuration of a latticework, whether a mat or a basket, thus differed with every product, while retaining its inherent reference to the plant which remains implicit within the materiality of its surface. The contingent nature of lattice and cordage can be seen to have served as an outward sign of the specific connections that were believed to prevail among people. It is their capacity to make visible an understanding of temporal connections that has given fibrous artifacts the status of an idealized model of sociality in today's world, which is more dominated by the materiality of fabric and thread than fiber. While cordage and lattice once carried opposing temporal maps of ancestral continuity and historical time, such an opposition no longer appears valid; for those who are living in the realm of the beyond, once occupied merely by the dead, are now the living, working for stretches at a time in the metropolis of the Pacific. Nothing could perhaps more poignantly underscore the integral part played by diasporic relations in the lives of those who stayed behind in the islands than the thread which now stitches the fabric of biography. In the Cook Islands a so-called "sleeping mat" (meonga) is still plaited from pandanus leaves, the pattern of the interlocking weaving being emphasized in the painted surface of the mat. Such meonga are rare today, both because of the difficulties of obtaining pandanus, and also because of the ubiquity of quilts sewn from imported fiber, which have largely taken the place of the mat in the exchanges of the household. This displacement of the mat by the quilt has led to a translation of the temporal mapping that is salient in the conception of the latticed mat into visually analogous images that are cut and stitched into the surface of quilt fabric. The visual and conceptual relation between the mat and the quilt, and the temporal logic prevailing in both, is not unique to the Cook Islands, but is perhaps most clearly articulated there for reasons that may have to do with the legal implication of tracing connections in a regionally dislocated world dominated by a burgeoning diasporic movement. When attachments to the homeland are contested or simply need to be asserted, fabric and thread have emerged as more versatile, materially and visually, in the mapping of relations than the techniques of latticework would allow. Polynesian quilts The cutting and resewing of new cloth has shaped the development of so called tivaivai or patchwork in the Cook Islands since the nineteenth century. Described mistakenly as quilts, tivaivai in fact are better described as sewing (fig. 1): for it was the imprinting of designs? through sewing, embroidery, and appliqu? techniques using precolored or sometimes even prepatterned material?that led, through the folding and cutting of cloth, to quilt-like, layered garments that were invested with new uses and ideas (Jones 1973; Arkana 1986; Hammond 1986; Pogglioli 1988; Rongokea 1992; Shaw 1996). Sewing of this kind has become increasingly popular, and these creations are a must-have component of exchanges marking the biography of a person from birth to death. There are three distinct types of quilt-like garments that are made and presented at life-cycle events (such as significant birthdays, a boy's first haircut, weddings and funerals). These three quilts carry generic names and are recognizable by the distinctive manner used to link a repeated singular motif on a planar surface: there is one that allows the eye to traverse across the plane in the reverse, through a repetition of a sequential arrangement of a motif that is valid for all successive pairing of the same motif; distinctly asymmetrical, this sewing is distinguished from another generalized type in which the motif is likewise repeated</page><page sequence="4">182 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 1. Seventh Day Adventist tivaivai exhibition in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, showing quilts and painted mats on display. Every year there are numerous such exhibitions organized by women's groups attached to churches in the Cook Islands; all exhibitions are competitive at the village level. Photograph: Susanne K?chler, 2003. across the plane, yet arranged in a distinctly rotational or diagonally offset symmetry; the symmetrical multiplication of a singular motif is also distinctive for the third type of sewing, yet here the symmetry is not circular, but linear, made visible by the central fold of the cloth and the linear unbroken stitching outlining the split motif. Despite these persistent ways of linking a multiplied motif on a planar surface, no sewing is ever the same, varying in color composition, choice of motif, and even chosen symmetry. As women use a multitude of visual reference material (often left behind by tourists or returning family) to come up with new ideas for motifs, the persistence of the manner of linking motifs and the predilection for choosing a single motif to be repeated across the plane is surprising and has prompted me to look more closely at these linkages and at what they are perceived to do in situations in which attachments are made or contested. The most valuable form of quilt is a type of patchwork called taorei (literally handkerchief) (fig. 2), in which several thousand tiny diamond or rectangular pieces of cloth are sewn together. The name derives possibly from second-hand cloth distributed as handkerchiefs by missionaries and reused for the patching of quilts in Polynesian households. Today, new cloth is bought in stores on the islands and graph paper, instead of the painted moenga or sleeping mats, is used to work out the design of the pattern, which can be given varying degrees of complexity without losing its essential logic of composition. Taorei always consist of a single multiply replicated motif (pu) that is connected by trails (tarere), creating an asymmetrical checkerboard pattern. There are two principal variations of this type of quilt: the construction of this tivaivai can involve the fabrication of squares that are repeated across the surface of the quilt in a reflexive, transitive, and yet asymmetric manner (fig. 3); that is, identical squares are linked so that the eye can pass from one to the other without the emerging pattern being reducible to a point symmetry. In the second</page><page sequence="5">K?chler: The modality of time-maps 183 Figure 2. Quilt known under the generic name of taorei. Composed of several thousand shredded cloth pieces, this taorei shows the pineapple as main motif. The quilt was sewn by the late Akaiti Ama, mother of eight children, principal of Ngatangia School, Head of Labour and Transport and Justice of the Peace after retirement. The quilt was sewn around 1960 when Akaiti Ama was pregnant with her fifth child and commemorates days spent on the pineapple plantation at Matavera. Originally it had a green backing which was replaced by an orange one in the 1990s. The quilt was bought by the Rarotongan Hotel in 2000. Photograph: Susanne K?chler, 2003. variation, the checkerboard pattern is simplified by using squares of embroidered cloth that may be fastened together using lace, crocheting, or simply thread. By repeating the motif in the round, rather than along the horizontal plane of the sewing, a new motif may appear which consists of enchained and integrally related fractal components that are repeated in twelve triangles from a central point (see fig. 2). Central to the construction of the pattern in both types are mathematical ideas as tiny colored pieces of shredded cloth are threaded in exact number and sequence onto a string before being re-stitched into a pattern. Ideally, the fractal pieces of the overall pattern are to be sewn by different woman, usually by sisters or, today, work colleagues, though in practice women now find it often less time consuming to carry out the work of sewing themselves. Individual pieces of the taorei can be kept and used as a template for recreating the quilt when the sewing has begun to disintegrate. Taorei are personal possessions that, if they are not wrapped around the owner at death, are gifted as a token of "vertical" succession?usually to a favorite grandchild who is also designated to be the recipient of certain tacit knowledge, such as knowledge of traditional medicine, and of dance or song composition. As tokens of knowledge transmitted across generations, such quilts hardly ever leave the household and tend to be retained in the original owner's treasure box even when gifted to a grandchild. The most popular sewing, which circulates most rapidly between related households in successive gifting occasions, is called ta taura (piecework) (fig. 4). It is an appliqu? work, usually of floral motifs with leaves; the</page><page sequence="6">184 RES 47 SPRING 2005 Figure 3. Quilt known under the generic name of taorei, composed of diamond shaped, shredded pieces of cloth. Quilt was made by the mother of Tungata Boasa of Aeora village in Atiu, Cook Islands, and was originally presented to her at her wedding in 1960. Photograph: Susanne K?chler, 2002. use of multicolored thread in the overstitching of embroidery gives the design the impression of being three-dimensional. Great care is taken to underscore the repetition of a singular motif by repeating the embroidery on each appliqu? piece with exactitude. Pieces of appliqu? are frequently re-sewn onto new backings and may even be altered in their symmetrical composition over time. Distinctive to the ta taura is the manifold replication of identical pu or motifs that usually consist of a single flower with its leaves and flowers positioned on the surface of the quilt with a rotating or diagonally offset symmetry that is both reflexive and transitive in that the pairing of two motives allows the remaining composition to be logically deduced. Such ta taura are the preferred gift at weddings and sons' haircutting ceremonies, where they inspire recollections of "horizontal," that is temporally coexisting genealogical connections formed through marriage, which link islands, villages, and named clans across generations. The third type of quilt pattern is called manu (bird), a cut out that is superimposed upon a background of opposing color (fig. 5). In construction, the material is folded four times before cutting the design into it, taking care to create an even balance of positive and negative space, with the motif unfolding along the central axes in symmetrical fashion. Both the cutting of the material and the sewing has to show a clear line, visible on the back of the quilt, which moves without stopping, with no obvious beginning or end. Tracings of cut-out designs are commonly drawn on tissue paper, and carefully stored for future reference. Such manu are the quickest to make and, as they generally do not involve more than two colors, are less expensive to produce, or arduous to plan, than other sewing. They are the preferred gift for those outside the immediate family, are readily "lent" to friends who need help in acquiring sewing that can be gifted, or are even sold to strangers. Often lost in exchanges, the pattern of this quilt can be remade repeatedly. Such is the presence of sewing in the life of women in the islands and diaspora communities of New Zealand and Australia alike, that the stability of the three generic types of quilts is surprising. If the Cook Island quilting styles were just the result of inter-island borrowing of ideas and a modification of artistic principles in line with regional aesthetics, as Joyce Hammond (1986) has suggested, one would expect a</page><page sequence="7">K?chler: The modality of time-maps 185 Figure 4.

In fact, Cook Island quilting patterns merely differ from those produced in other parts of the Pacific in the choice of motifs and color combinations, yet consistently deploy the same manner of connecting motifs on the planar surface of the quilt as used by other Polynesian communities. Here and elsewhere, the attachment women have to the quilts they have sewn is intense, suggesting that the ideas invested in the making are profound and capable of charging intentional action, and are thus not merely a matter of (disinterested) aesthetic pleasure. As Elizabeth Arkana says, Hawaiian quilts ". . . contain much mana. If one should die and leave much spirit behind, it could be damaging and might never be able to achieve real rest" (1986:5). The intense attachment of person and quilt means that quilts are only separated temporarily from the maker, eventually being returned at death. While Hawaiian quilts were burned, Cook Island quilts are buried with the dead in concrete, tomb-like structures erected next to the entrance of houses. This physical proximity of death, bygone times, and complex genealogical connections that come together in the individual buried in the tomb, gives conceptions of temporality that are expressed in quilts a heightened state of significance. Sewing and the mapping of time As quilt-like sewing works are in effect the burial shrouds of their maker, anticipating a future state of being where all possible past and present temporal</page><page sequence="9">K?chler: The modality of time-maps 187 worlds coalesce, a deep association?which traverses the production, circulation, and "style" of the quilt? exists between biographical time and quilting. The quilt in fact resonates with temporal logic in generic ways that go beyond individual recollections of biographical time to the non-causal, but modalized, that is logically describable, an enchainment of events in what Alfred Gell called "B-series time" (Gell 1992:238-241). B-series time, according to Gell, reflects the temporal relationships between events as they really are, out there, while the A-series provides subjective and tensed perceptions of events that happen in the B-series temporal territory. In order to know how to act in a "timely" manner, to plan and anticipate what might happen, but also to defend claims about the past, we have to construct representations of B-series time, so called time-maps, that allow us to "navigate" in time based on an understanding of how possible worlds are connected with one another (Ibid.: 235-236). Time maps, like maps we use to navigate in space, rely on images to be generated that correspond to how the world appears to us; these images would be useless for navigation, however, unless they are visualized in a map-like manner. This translation of non-indexical space-time beliefs into images and back into maps creates what Gell called "indexical fixes" or perceptual beliefs that give rise to our inward sense of time (Ibid.: 236-237). Image-based maps of B-series time are not the "real thing," but as no experience is possible of "real" four-dimensional space-time we are forced to rely on reconstructions in mastering time. The mastering of time as genealogical knowledge is of fundamental importance in the Cook Islands where space is at a premium and where locating oneself in a time-map of social relations is the prerequisite for being granted the right to land. Where sometimes more than forty-eight generations can be recounted as coming together in one person, a fractal map that depicts the enchainment of social relations serves as a model of relationality that can be used to make decisions whenever matters of attachment are at stake. Quilts as time-maps thus evoke both a world of images, which are derived from subject-centered time awareness (in that they are in and of a specific place and time), and which match these images against invariant templates derived from the underlying cognitive maps of the B-series (lbid.:254). As maps, image-based representations such as the quilts of the Cook Islands draw out as temporal beliefs the logic of our internal, template-like representation of time. Quilts seen as time-maps are thus ordered in a highly standardized and systemic manner, depicting a modal logic that tells us about all possibilities that are deemed feasible to connect events so that one may think about them as being before or after, necessary or possible. The symmetry specific to each of the three Cook Island quilts displays precisely such a modal time-map: the quilts do not reflect subjective and tensed perceptions of events or culturally specific beliefs of how events in past, present, and future are disposed toward one another, but rather a generalized temporal logic; and it is because the mapping of time is logical, rather than culturally relative, that Cook Island style quilts are found across Eastern Polynesia and beyond. The linear arrangement of the cut-out quilt (manu) recalls the linear enchainment of possible worlds in which specific paths that connect past, present, and future are singled out. The cognitive activity of "projecting" that is involved in giving time-maps linearity in this manner is fundamental to the production of the cut-out, which, when folded, requires one to envision the cut lines projected symmetrically across the missing planes in order to arrive at a recognizable image of a flower or plant when the fabric is unfolded. In contrast to the cut-out, no unique past, present, and future is represented in the appliqu? quilt (ta taura): here repeated, identical images, usually of flowers, are arranged, usually in rotational or diagonally offset symmetry, to depict the reflexive, transitive, but symmetrical relation between possible and coexisting worlds; by visualizing equivalences between images as a singular, repeated motif arranged in a precise symmetrical manner on the quilt, no significant relational structure emerges. In contrast to the relational symmetry of the appliqu? quilt, images are arranged in an asymmetric manner in the patchwork quilt (taorei): here interconnecting paths (tiare) mirror the before and after relation between successive images (pu) of possible worlds that, as in the appliqu? quilt, are identical to each other. Past, present, and future are depicted as relational, but not unique, and as reflexive, transitive, and progressive. Rather than assuming that women project their personal biographies into the quilts they are stitching, the quilt as time-map enables women to project an understanding of their lives in ways that speak to others. One could even go further and say that it is because quilts comprehend time by locating subjective images,</page><page sequence="10">188 RES 47 SPRING 2005 sometimes recalling specific datable events, in a logical and non-indexical map, that they can figure as the quintessential inalienable exchange object that enables one to keep while giving (Weiner 1992). We can now begin to imagine how quilting may enable women to manage time, and relations unfolding in time, in ways that are made effective in the performativity of exchange, when quilts not only connect persons but enchain past, present, and future in ways that resonate with temporal beliefs. As they navigate time, quilts have real consequences for people's lives and are not just decorative implements of households. Quilts thus participate in the management of temporal beliefs that are perceived vital to health, wealth, progeny, and salvation. It is thus also for ultimately practical reasons that time-maps are logically conceived, rather than being merely richly symbolic or indexical. It would merely be stating the obvious to say that every quilt is valued with respect to the time it took to be sewn. It is true that women, when asked, are able to give a very exact estimate of how long it would take to finish a quilt just started, or how long they have indeed spent on a quilt. Much of what can be said about the temporal logic underlying quilting could be extended to mats, but the visual and material differentiation facilitated by the sewing techniques of quilting amplify some of the more salient practical reasoning. Sewing has enabled time-maps to be shared and modal ized, describing that which we have no access to in human experience in ways that allow temporal worlds to be charted predictably. By mapping the otherwise inaccessible territory of four-dimensional space-time, which once was thought as the sphere of the ancestral, quilting took over where ritual stopped. With the introduction of Christianity, and the demise of ritual, cordage-based imagery has given way to new thread-based techniques of image making, such as sewing and embroidery. Central to pre-Christian ritual were so called stick-gods carved from wood, with knobbly protruding figures repeated down the front of the figure. Wrapped in barkcloth and cordage, such stick-gods were only unwrapped at the height of the ritual. Touching the protruding knobbly extensions of the carved rakau whakapapa of the Maori today still aids memory in the recitation of genealogy (Mead 1984:218). Yet just as the touching of the stick-god was restricted to the momentary ritual "undressing" of the gods so brilliantly described by Babadzan (1993) for ancient Tahiti, so the quilts are today taken out of their storage boxes only once a year, to be shaken out, cleaned, inspected, and, if need be, mended by being given a new backing that covers the quilt when it is folded up again and returned to the box for another year (like the dressing of the staff-god with a new layer of cloth). Genealogies, sometimes extending over forty generations, are similarly recited whenever tivaivai are gifted. With this new-found appeal of sewing thread-based ?mages, the once quite distinct logic of mapping evident in latticed things became blurred with that of cordage in the fashioning of patched and embroidered quilt-like sewing and the overstitching of plaited mats. What emerged in the conflation of cordage and lattice-based techniques of mapping were unique time-maps that elicit a temporal logic in which ideas of continuity through acts of renewal merged with empowerment through acts of containment. There are no historical data that document the taking up of sewing and the fashioning of tivaivai across the island nations of Eastern Polynesia, from Tonga and the Cook Islands to Tahiti and Hawaii. For the Cook Islands we do know that cotton cloth was a sought-after trade item, and that cotton planting and printing were well established on the main island around 1850, barely twenty-five years after the London Missionary Society had arrived on the islands (Gilson 1980:44^47).1 Although many have derived from the value ascribed to cotton fabric in the heyday of missionary activity, the conclusion that sewing quilt-like fabrics was learned from missionary wives, an alternative and interesting hypothesis, was advanced by Robert Shaw (1996). Writing about the history of the Hawaiian quilt, he questioned the link between patching, which was indeed taught by missionary wives to foster domestic attitudes and time management, and quilt making, which in Hawaii resulted in a block-style quilt that involved the cutting of cloth into snowflake patterns (Arkana 1986). Noting the absence of this type of quilting in America during the early part of the nineteenth century, with the exception of Pennsylvanian missions who taught German paper-cut techniques at mission schools and only set foot in Hawaii in 1860, Shaw points out that Hawaiians may already have been introduced to western sewing, clothing, and even quilts by sailors on the trading ships that preceded missionary 1. The relation between the introduction of Christianity and the taking up and transformation of cotton fabric in the Pacific has been described in detail in the introduction to Chloe Colchester's Clothing the Pacific (2003) and in the introduction to K?chler and Were's The Art of Clothing (in press).</page><page sequence="11">K?chler: The modality of time-maps 189 influence in the Pacific. In 1800 you could already buy almost everything on the shores of Hawaii, as the booming trade in sandalwood had brought Chinese silks, cotton, and costumes, transported by scores of Russian ships. The association of quilting with materials imported from foreign places gave it a lasting value that in many places outstripped the prestige value associated with pandanus fiber. The emphasis on the exchange value of the quilt explains why in Polynesia they are hardly ever displayed on a bed, although they are measured according to a standard bed size, but are folded and kept in treasure trunks as tokens of connections that often radiate far beyond the shores of an island. We can now also see that what enables quilts to possess such an exchange value is grounded in their style's lack of cultural specificity, and in a generic temporal logic.
