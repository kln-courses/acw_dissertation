<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALYSON CALLAN University College London Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh ABSTRACT Unlike the saintly power of her male counterpart, which is conceived as an attribute of the individual, the spiritual power of the female saint in Sylhet, Bangladesh, is attributed to a supernatural entity that is temporarily affiliated with her. This difference cannot simply be regarded as an example of gendered domains of religious practice, in which men study the Qu'ran and women traffic with spirits, as in Sylhet, male healers practice with the aid of spirits. I describe how one woman's saintly status allowed her to resist the virilocal rule of residence, a patriarchal structure that is said to underpin women's subordinate position in Bangladesh. Her story demonstrates that Islam cannot be conflated with patriarchy and that it may support women's emancipation from structures of male authority. The meaning of Islam is context dependent and revised through practice. [Islam, gender, agency, sainthood, Bangladesh, spirit possession, healing] uring my fieldwork in Sylhet, Bangladesh, I came across a hand Dful of female healers known locally asfiranis (female saints; fir is Sylheti for pir, an Islamic saint).1 I was surprised by the discov ery: I had read that, although women may practice healing on an informal basis, giving foo (holy words whispered then "blown" in the direction of the patient) and bonesetting, no female healers operated on a professional basis in Bangladesh (Gardner 1995; Wilce 1998).2 There is nothing informal about Nadira Firani's practice. Like the spe cialist doctors in Sylhet town, she operates a ticket system for consulta tions, which take place at her home in a village 15 kilometers from the town. The purchase of a ticket guarantees a place in the queue (but not necessarily a consultation, as Nadira's spiritual power may leave her at any time). Such is her popularity that my research assistant, Shoma, and I were advised to get to her home before 9 a.m. to secure an early place in the queue. Nadira starts seeing clients at 10 a.m. and finishes before the midday prayer, having seen up to 50 clients. I observed equal numbers of men and women waiting to see her.3 As is the case in other professional healers' waiting areas, at Nadira's home the men's area is segregated from the women's. Men sit on benches outside her small consulting chamber, and women sit inside a separate wooden building. Refreshments are avail able for purchase, and a stall sells bottles of oil and rosewater, the basic materials for Nadira's treatment methods. About a kilometer down the road from Nadira's house and on the same bus route to Sylhet is the home of Shuli Firani. At 24, Shuli is a few years older than Nadira and is slightly longer established as a healer.4 Like Nadira, Shuli sees patients in the mornings until the midday prayer, when her spiritual power leaves her. Unlike Nadira's, Shuli's visitors are predom inantly female; Shuli forbids men to visit her, unless accompanied by a woman. Shuli sees roughly the same number of patients that Nadira does, around 40 a day. In terms of reputation, Nadira may have a slight edge over Shuli: A couple of times, when Shoma and I told the bus conductor where we were heading on our visits to see these two firanis, someone on the bus AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST, Vol. 35, No. 3, pp. 396-412, ISSN 0094-0496, online ISSN 1548-1425. ? 2008 by the American Anthropological Association.

It seemed testament to their standing that both their homes had become official stopping points for the bus. In this article, I explore the phenomenon of female saints in Bangladesh.5 Given women's subordinate position and polluted status in Bangladesh (Blanchet 1984:62), I ad dress how it is possible for female saints to be not only tolerated but also actively patronized. After giving a brief overview of local Islam and women's status in Bangladesh, I consider the role of the fir and outline the status of the fe male saint in the history of Islam. I then discuss the ways in which contemporary Sylheti firanis' authority is legitimized compared to the ways their male counterparts achieve le gitimacy. Finally, I discuss the extent to which the firanis represent a counterhegemonic force. Although Islam is of ten portrayed as working in tandem with patriarchy to op press women (Mohanty 2003), I show that, in the case of the firanis, Islam cannot be conflated with local modes of patriarchy. This article is based on fieldwork I carried out in Sylhet between 1999 and 2005.6 Altogether I met and interviewed seven women attracting the appellation of firani, but I have chosen to concentrate on Nadira and Shuli because they were by far the most popular. Unlike Nadira and Shuli, who saw scores of people every day,7 each of my two town fi ranis saw small but steady streams of clients two days a week; the three remaining rural firanis had very few clients. One was semiretired because of ill health. Nadira and Shuli were much younger than the other firanis, who were in their fifties or older. Despite their youth, narratives mythologiz ing their power could be collected throughout the Sylhet region. Local Islam Sylhet came to be known as the land of the saints after Shah lalal and his 360 olis (or walis: friends [of Allah], saints) settled there.8 The saints' shrines that dot the towns and countryside are everyday reminders of this legacy. Although traditionally associated with heterodox folk Islam, today's shrine leaders are undergoing increasing Islamization, and the mystical elements of some saints' cults are being re placed by orthodox ritual (Bertocci 2006; Gardner 1993). As elsewhere in the Muslim world, a plurality of Islamic groups compete to define what constitutes Islamic orthodoxy (Ahamed 2006; Hefner 1998). Bangladeshi fundamentalist organizations encompass both nonpolitical proselytizing groups and political parties. The shrine leaders have taken an oppositional stance to the Islamist political parties. Af ter a series of bomb blasts in August 2005, the shrine leaders threatened to withdraw their support from the ruling party, the Bangladeshi National Party, because of its association with Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party accused of masterminding the bomb attacks {Daily Star, 2005). Since the mid-1970s, successive governments have supported the Islamization of social and political life. This support has been partly in response to popular sentiment in favor of Islam but has also been aimed at attracting funding from oil-rich Middle East countries. The shift toward ortho dox Islam has also been facilitated by two global trends. The first is mass education. Contrary to scholarly predictions, Western-style mass education has not reduced the signifi cance of religion but has supported the growth of religious fundamentalism. The heterodox teachings of the tradi tional, often illiterate, Islamic leaders are being questioned by a new generation of literate, college-educated students who have direct access to the religious texts (Bowen 1993; Horvatich 1994). In Bangladesh, Jamaat-e-Islami's support base is largely urban and middle class. The party is par ticularly popular with students, consistently winning over 55 percent of student-union elections since 1980 (Ahmad 1991). A second trend is overseas migration. "Deterritori alization" (Appadurai 1990:301), the process by which reli gions, ethnicities, and economies span nation-states, pro motes the appeal of fundamentalisms: The discourse of core elements is able to transcend national boundaries, uniting dispersed religious groups settled throughout the world. Sylhet is the area of Bangladesh that has become most associated with overseas migration. It is the return mi grants to Sylhet who are most likely to support the "ortho dox" shrine leaders (Gardner 1995). The status of women and the virilocal rule of residence Bangladesh is one of only five countries in the world in which women have a shorter life expectancy than men (Khan 2001:255). The virilocal rule of residence is said to un derpin women's low status. Because daughters leave their natal home to live with their husbands' families at the time of marriage, nurturing them can be regarded as a rela tive waste of resources compared with nurturing sons, who stay within and contribute to the wealth of the household. Daughters can be seen as a burden, as great care must be taken to ensure that they do not get "spoiled" before mar riage (Kabeer 1988). After marriage, a woman is an outsider in her husband's household and may be feared by his kin as a sorcerer. Her husband's household is rarely located in the same village as, and may be a long distance from, her natal home. Marriage is recognized as a stressful time for women, and new brides have been known to go mad shortly after marriage. However, women's oppression is not experienced in a uniform way. Social class may transcend gender: Middle class women oppress poor men. Older women achieve a 397</page><page sequence="3">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 higher status as mothers and, as mothers-in-law, may op press their sons' wives (cf. Kandiyoti 1988). Whereas over seas migration has led to an increase in the power of mothers?in the absence of men, mothers are left to run households?the trend of husbands working abroad has led to an increase in the social isolation and vulnerability of wives (Callan 2007; Gardner 1995). Can women be saints in Islam? The term pir refers to a Sufi saint,9 but few of the reli gious specialists in Sylhet who were called "firs" claimed to have any connection with Sufism.10 Rather, the term fir referred to a diverse body of holy men who were Islamic teachers, healers, and spiritual guides and whose spiritual power placed them above mullahs but below olis in the con tinuum of superhuman potencies possessed by mortal be ings;11 many of the firs that I met were renowned for per forming miracles. Those that were called "fir" ranged from religious leaders who had their own publishing houses and madrassahs to lengtafirs (lit. naked firs): "mad" men, intox icated by their divine love for Allah. Partly because of this diversity, the concept of "pir" has been seen as a marker for Bengali Muslim identity, drawing and redrawing "the fluc tuating line between what is considered acceptable for Ben gali Muslims and what is not" (Landell-Mills 1992:401). Does this line stretch to include women firs? Not in present-day Bangladesh, according to Samuel Landell Mills: The Pir role is explicitly male, and in many ways Pir serve as masculine emblems of a spiritual order which is reproduced by the transmission between men. The power granted by initiation passes down through per fected souls in male bodies.... Women do not have the capacity to become Pir. This may be ascribed to an all pervasive pollution ideology which designates women as inherently different to men and as physically trapped within the biological entity, which is also seen as the emotional entity. [1992:315]12 Although Nadira and Shuli Firanis' client group covered a wide range of social classes, a few dissenting voices could be heard among local people. Some mullahs and laypeople doubted their authenticity, saying that female saints were not mentioned in the Qur'an. Yet these same informants also doubted the authenticity of some male firs: "Their pupils call them 'fir,' that's all. Real firs do exist but they are very rare in Bangladesh. They have miraculous powers and can vanish and reappear instantly in another part of the country." Historically, theologians have argued about whether women could be prophets, with some proposing that the Virgin Mary, Sara (Abraham's wife), and the mother of Moses attained the status of prophet because angels spoke to them (Stowasser 1994). One of my informants, a female college student, told me that women could not be prophets because being a prophet was a lifelong calling, and during their menstrual years women could not perform their re ligious duties fully. In Islam, menstruation makes women ritually impure, preventing them from performing canon ical prayers and rendering fasting void.13 Another Islamic prohibition that might militate against women taking a full part in religious activities is purdah (Pemberton 2004). This prohibition has been interpreted widely, ranging in expres sion from a requirement that men and women dress mod estly when mixing with each other to a strict spatial segre gation of the sexes. Feminist commentators on Islam have stressed the extent to which purdah has been shaped by so cial, economic, and historical conditions and cite women's high profile in early Islam as evidence that Islam originally carried a feminist message. During the time of the Prophet and shortly after his death, women attended the mosque, acted as imams and religious teachers, and were respected as reliable transmitters of the Hadith, and Aysha, one of the Prophet's wives, gave political speeches at the mosque and led her followers into battle (Ahmed 1992; Mernissi 1991; Roded 1994). Rabia al-Adawiyya and other prominent Sufi women were revered as saints, and their shrines are still visited today in North Africa, the Middle East, and India (Fernea and Bezirgan 1977; Schimmel 1997). However, over the centuries, women's position in Islam has been eroded. As Islam widened its influence, it incorporated the patriar chal gender norms of pre-Islamic cultures (Ahmed 1992). Nevertheless, women do not constitute a unitary category, and today their status is contextually and conceptually de pendent. Whereas Islam constructs young women as sex ually threatening and in need of control (Mernissi 1987), in Bangladesh mothers are revered: A commonly heard ex pression is "Heaven is under the mother's feet," meaning that obedience to the mother is the path to heaven. How, then, do the firanis, as young, unmarried women, get their legitimacy? To explore this, I compare the stories of how the firanis got their saintly power with those of male firs. Legitimacy of saintly authority within Islam The saint in Islam occupies a somewhat contradictory po sition. Although Islam's monotheism and egalitarian ethos militate against worship of mortal beings, some Muslims have argued that the saint's role is necessary in bridging the gap between the people and the sacred. In the absence of a formal system of ordination within Islam, the saint plays a vital intermediary role, serving as the human embodiment of a faceless god (Landell-Mills 1998) and providing exege sis of the Qur'an, the textual embodiment of Allah's mes sage, which, like all holy texts, cannot be fully comprehen sive (Lindholm 1998). One of my fir informants explained 398</page><page sequence="4">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh American Ethnologist the fir's intermediary role in the following way: "If people have a problem in this world, they can't talk directly to the judge in the court, they have to go through a lawyer. The fir is like a lawyer in the spiritual world: First people go to a fir and then the fir prays to Allah." Legitimation of saintly authority occurs both at the level of the individual and at the level of a wider power base. Attribution of supernatural powers to the individual em phasizes the uniqueness of the saint, yet the paradigmatic nature of the stories narrating how that power was achieved derives the saint's authority from globally shared esoteric knowledge (Werbner 1995). As well as possession of super natural powers, followers stress the saint's connection to an existing saintly lineage, usually with the claim to blood ties; often, spiritual genealogies are traced back to Muhammad. By the passing of power from father to son, or from teacher to disciple, the saint's charisma is routinized (Brinner 1987). Of all the firs that I met in Sylhet, Roxmotgong Fir ap peared to have the most resources: He and his sons own a publishing house in Dhaka that publishes a monthly mag azine; the fir runs an orphanage and has established over a hundred madrassahs. He has two wives: one who reportedly prays to Allah all day and all night and one who, presum ably, attends to the fir's earthly needs. His followers stressed that he is a bow ilim {ilim means religious knowledge or a person who has that knowledge; bow means big, impor tant, powerful). His followers also reported that he got his spiritual power from his father-in-law, who one day called him aside and said to him, "A little ilim will become a big one." His transformation did not occur instantaneously but was achieved through years of diligent study (this is echoed in the advice given in a pamphlet published by Roxmot gong: "People don't find Allah's power quickly; you need to be a disciple. One disciple teaches another one."). The Rox motgong literature traces his spiritual genealogy back to Ali bin Talib, son-in-law of Muhammad, via Khwaja Muinud din Chisti, the famous Sufi saint of Ajmer in India. His fol lowers told me that he is such a powerful saint that he has a direct connection with Allah: "like a telephone line." The miracles that he has performed are related to healing: mak ing the paralyzed walk again and curing mad people who had been tied up. Legitimacy of the firanis In contrast to that of the male fir, the spiritual power of the firani is not attributed to the individual herself but, rather, to some supernatural entity that is temporarily affiliated with her. One of my mullah informants dismissed the pos sibility that women could possess saintly power: "There are no firanis in the Qur'an. But," he went on to add, "there are many women upon whom zinn (jinn) have taken shelter or they have spirit sickness ... at that time when they are pos sessed they are able to say a lot about the future which turns out to be true. These they call firanis." Here the mullah lim its women's supernatural power to clairvoyancy; yet the fi ranis in my locality were visited for a range of problems sim ilar to those for which male firs were consulted. Still, like the mullah, local laypeople located their power as residing out side the firanis. Here is the story of how Nadira Firani got her power, as told by a female college student who lives in a village approximately ten kilometers from Nadira's house: Her father dreamt that somebody wanted to stay with his son. At that time the son was going abroad. So her father said in his dream, "No, don't stay with my son, stay with my daughter." So after that the zinn came to stay with his daughter for five years. In the meantime she gives tabiz [amulets] and fani fora [water made holy through having foo blown over it]. They [the zinn] said it will be for the good of her family. You have to go between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., because outside those hours she is not able to say anything?between those hours the zinn-e-mumin [a spirit who follows the Mus lim faith] stays with her. When the zinn leave her, Nadira has no special abil ity; as Nadira herself told us, "Allah has given this power; [he] has made me the medium.14 I have no power; I have no ilim. Those that are with me ... it is their ilim."15 Her mother added, "During her childhood she didn't go to a proper madrassah and she didn't study properly, but when she is possessed she can read and write all the prayers and tabiz." Similarly, people attributed Shuli's saintly power to her affiliation with a supernatural being. Here is the story of how Shuli Firani got her power, as related by Nazima, a woman living in a village about ten kilometers away (two bus rides) from Shuli's house: One day, she suddenly went missing. Her mother and father searched for her, but they were unable to find her. Actually, these parents with whom she lived were not her real parents, but her adoptive ones. When they could not find her they did azir [summoned a zinn] and asked the zinn where she was. They found out from the zinn that she was underwater. So they got a fish ing net and cast it in the pond but were unable to pull her out. They did azir again and asked the zinn what they should do. The zinn replied that the earth next to the pond steps should be covered with a thick layer of soil, and that her mother should not go there. Despite doing this, many days later she still had not emerged so they did azir again and asked the zinn what they should do now. This time the zinn told them that a lot of fruit should be laid next to the pond steps every day. Every day her father left fruit next to the pond steps and every day all the fruit disappeared, but who ate it nobody saw. After 14 days had passed like that a large stone appeared next to the pond steps. Her parents did azir again and asked the zinn what they should do now. 399</page><page sequence="5">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 The zinn told them that a candle should be lit next to the stone. The father lit a candle next to the stone ev ery day for 14 days. After 14 days had passed the firani came out of the pond. She had survived underwater for 14 days; for the following 14 days she had stayed on the pond steps. She asked her parents to build her a mondir [temple] for her on the pond steps.16 Her father built the mondir; the stone, which had been placed inside a casket, is kept in the mondir. Nowadays, the firani goes daily to the mondir and speaks to the stone and prays there, and for the rest of the time she stays inside her house. The police arrested her once, but she was able to walk out of her locked prison cell so now everyone, including the police, believes that she is genuine.17 This narrative shares two of the three features that Pnina Werbner (1995) considers paradigmatic of pir biogra phies: initiation through overcoming a physical ordeal (sur viving underwater for 14 days) and a triumphant encounter with a temporal authority (escaping from police custody).18 Shuli's religiosity is also signaled by her lack of interest in the material world and her attention to purdah: Accord ing to Nazima's account, when Shuli is not praying at the mondir, she stays indoors, keeping herself apart from unre lated male kin. Nazima's paternal aunt, who had consulted Shuli about chest and back pain, emphasized that Shuli al ways wore white clothes and no jewelry (the customary at tire of widows), which is further evidence of her piety.19 But, like Nadira's, Shuli's power is located within a superhuman entity that is temporarily affiliated with her. One informant told me people believe that if Shuli gets married, all her saintly power will go?she has a zinn-e-mumin, a fir, or an oli with her. (In Nazima's account, the reference to a lot of fruit being eaten by something unseen clearly points to the presence of a zinn, as zinn are notorious for having huge appetites for food and they are invisible. Nazima later con firmed that Shuli consulted a zinn, which told her how to manage her patients.) Spirit possession: A gendered domain of religious practice? Do these data simply reiterate the commonly stated anthro pological observation that in the Islamic world spirit pos session and knowledge of the holy scriptures reflect two distinct, gendered domains of religious practice? In Islamic Africa, women traffic with spirits, and men have access to a "universal" Islam based on the holy scriptures (Boddy 1994; Lambek 1993; Lewis 1989). Although men do not deny the existence of spirits, in the context of Islamism they are likely to regard women who appease spirits as un-Islamic: Proper Muslims appeal directly to Allah (Masquelier 2001). Correspondingly, women's participation in spirit cults can be regarded as counterhegemonic to mainstream Islam; the appeasement rituals of the zar spirits offer a parodical commentary on local gender relations (Boddy 1989), and the displays of immodesty observed at the bori spirit cer emony invert the usual Islamic norms of feminine decorum (Masquelier 2001). Although men may be victims of spirit possession, in the Sudan they refrain from joining in the zar spirit ceremonies for fear of ridicule (Boddy 1989).20 The situation in Sylhet is rather different. Many of the male healers I met worked with the assistance of one or more zinn, doing azir: making the zinn appear to give ad vice on treatment, usually after a discussion with the healer. At first glance, this may suggest that the male healers had control over their zinn and were able to summon their su pernatural power whenever they required it. Recalcitrant zinn guilty of disturbing humans are summarily brought to heel by a competent practitioner: A Muslim exorcist told me, "Having got down on the floor and touched your feet he [the zinn] will call you master, he will call you father; having asked for permission he will leave and he won't return." Yet closer inspection reveals a more complex relation ship than a master-servant one. The healer has to make careful preparations for the zinn's arrival: An ashon (sacred seat) may have to be prepared, decked with inducements such as scented candles and enchanted pieces of cloth. The above exorcist is subject to certain restrictions on times he can practice: His zinn, like most, is frightened of the light, so the exorcist has to wait until midnight before he can call it. Except for a loincloth, he has to sit naked so that his body is open to receiving the zinn. He does not like to practice with others present: He cannot be held responsi ble for the actions of his zinn; and his zinn, being a good Muslim one, could strike a person dead if it heard the per son swear. (A fir told me that he did not practice with a zinn because there were children living in his house.) Many of Mufti Huzur's healing sessions ended in disappointment, as the Huzur's mufti {mufti is the term that the Huzur used for his zinn; mufti is Arabic for a legal scholar empowered to issue a fatwa; a huzur is a learned holy man) did not al ways come when the Huzur called him: Sometimes he was busy with work elsewhere or was ill with a fever. When Mufti Huzur was a child, his mufti, whom he had inherited from his paternal grandfather, whisked him away in his sleep to a madrassah in another county, where he remained undis covered by his worried parents for several months. Previous commentators have argued that, for Sylhetis, practicing with zinn is representative of unorthodox Is lam and is frowned on by orthodox Muslims who advo cate control rather than accommodation of zinn (Gardner 1995; Pollen 2001). Delineating what constitutes Islamic or thodoxy and what does not is tricky and runs the risk of reaching tautological conclusions: Practicing with zinn is unorthodox Islamic practice when orthodoxy is defined as refraining from practicing with zinn. If, for the purposes of this article, orthodox Islam is defined as belief and behavior closely affiliated with the holy scriptures, then Roxmotgong 409</page><page sequence="6">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh American Ethnologist Fir and Keramotnogor Fir were the most orthodox of the firs that I came across in Sylhet: Both teach at madrassahs, and their expansive rooms are lined with holy books. I once saw Keramotnogor Fir treat a spirit-possessed young woman by beating her with his stick, a practice that constitutes ortho dox Islamic exorcism (Gardner 1995) .21 I did not have the opportunity to speak directly to Keramotnogor Fir about his views on zinn, but his followers did not give me any evi dence to suggest that Roxmotgong Fir believed that traffick ing with zinn was evil and unlslamic. Mufti Huzur, a disci ple of Keramotnogor Fir, told me that, although the fir did not do azir, zinn were among his disciples and came to be taught by him at his madrassah. But Keramotnogor Fir's relationship with zinn did not seem to be simply a teacher-pupil one. Mufti Huzur told me about a case in which a boy had become ill after catch ing and eating a fish containing a zinn. The offended zinn had led a delegation of fellow zinn who frequented the same pond and told Keramotnogor Fir not to interfere; when the boy's family went to see the fir, they were told by his daugh ter that he could not make the boy better (Mufti Huzur's mufti successfully treated him, instead). Roxmotgong Fir's son told me that his father did not do azir, that it was for bidden by his fir. However, the son recognized that sorcery and spirit sickness existed and came close to acknowledging that a healer more powerful than his father was required to treat them: "Aims can give fani fora, but if it is old [chronic] they need to go to somebody else for todbir [treatment in volving azir]." The firanis, agency, and resistance As well as their participation in spirit cults, women's atten dance at saints' shrines has been regarded as a female ex pression of Islamic religious practice. Women in Arab coun tries, marginalized at or excluded from the mosque, strive for agency and sacralize their own space at the shrine com plex, sharing grievances and a sense of community with other women (Doumato 2000; Mazumdar and Mazumdar 2002; Mernissi 1975). Before discussing how far this behav ior is applicable to the case of Bangladesh, I consider the ex tent to which being a firani led to personal fulfillment and empowerment for each of the two individuals with whom I am concerned. Nadira Firani Nadira is the third eldest of six children. She has an older sister who is married and an older brother who drives an autorickshaw; her two younger brothers and younger sis ter are still at school. Her mother thought that, since early childhood, Nadira had always been a bit unwell; at school she sometimes lost consciousness, and her brother would have to bring her home. In retrospect, her mother thinks that this was because the zinn had started to disturb her, but the zinn did not formally announce their arrival until Nadira had completed the final year of her primary school and was about to be admitted to high school (i.e., around the age of 11). Nadira explained, When they first came they used to teach me in my dreams that there was some prayers that if I read them they would become [my] ashik [lover, fan].... When they first possessed [me], my body was burning a lot and I couldn't bear to see anybody, not even my mother. When I used to be possessed, it used to hap pen suddenly, I used to lose consciousness. The word ashik is often used when referring to spiritual love: In a case of spirit possession that an exorcist treated, the offending zinn came because it had become an ashik of the (female) victim's religious scholarship. Nevertheless, I was curious about Nadira's use of the word ashik, especially as she was an unmarried young woman of marriageable age. Nadira would not be drawn into confirming whether more than one zinn visited her, but she did admit that it was or they were male. What would happen if Nadira got mar ried? Would the zinn be jealous? Sensing her daughter's em barrassment at my prurient line of questioning, her mother answered, "At first, I didn't want those that were with her [the zinn] to stay?I wanted to give a grown-up daughter in marriage. Next Bokra Eid we will try to free her.22 Now, I want to see if there is any way that they can help us to send our son abroad." Her maternal aunt thought that, if the fam ily wanted to, they could say goodbye to the zinn at any time or they could keep them with Nadira, but her mother was less confident: "If marriage happens perhaps they will go ... if she is given in marriage we will need to give her with their [the zinn's] permission. If they say no, we can't give her in marriage?she will be harmed." Marriage is more or less compulsory for women (and men) in Bangladesh: Nadira and Shuli were the only two cases I encountered of women who had a reason for not get ting married that was understandable and acceptable to lo cal people. Apart from avoiding the wrath of the zinn, stay ing unmarried, and therefore asexual, preserved Nadira's holy status. In Sylhet town, love marriages are rare but may be possible, contingent on the parents' liberal outlook. In rural Sylhet, however, love marriages carry great shame. Par ents give their daughters in marriage to another family, vir ilocal residence being the rule. This process can make the daughter feel that a suitable groom has been lovingly and carefully selected for her by her parents or, at the other end of the spectrum, she can be made to feel like a pawn in her parents' bid to achieve wealth and status. For a woman from Nadira's low social class, the norm is to be given in marriage by the age of 15. To suggest that Nadira welcomed postponing the responsibilities of marriage may be ethno centric. Moreover, I wondered if she felt under pressure 481</page><page sequence="7">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 from her family to remain a firani, to work until she had earned enough money for the family to send her brother abroad. Common to the narratives mythologizing Nadira's power was the idea that the zinn's presence would enable her brother to go abroad. Nadira told me that the zinn would not fly him abroad but that the family would have to approach a middleman, somebody who procured immigration papers, I imagined, and the zinn would try to make the middleman effective. I wondered if the family was relying less on the zinn's super natural power and more on the cash that Nadira was earn ing through her work as a firani. Although Nadira did not charge very much?3 taka for a ticket, 10 taka to consult on a problem, plus profits from the sale of oil and rosewater?I calculated that she could earn up to 1,000 taka ($24) a day. There was no visible evidence that this money was being spent: Nadira and her family continued to live in wooden, thatched-roof buildings typical of a poor village family, un like Shuli, whose advancement from such dwellings to a large stone house was taken as evidence of her popularity and, therefore, belief in her saintly power. Yet Nadira has some control. The story I quoted above about how Nadira got her spiritual power credits her fa ther as having made a deal with the zinn, but in her own story, Nadira gives herself greater agency. When the zinn first came, Nadira's father had been mad for seven years: "We used to have another homestead, a bit further away. Af ter selling that house [my father] went mad?his body used to burn.23 They [the zinn] said to me that if I allowed them to take shelter in me, they would make my father better and would make all the people in this world better." Her mother continued, He has been well since then. After they first possessed her we went to a fir and she became a disciple. [The zinn] told her to go to that fir so she could become a dis ciple and he could make her body closed so they could get proper shelter from her. After that, they wanted an ashon [seat] from her. When they took her as their ashon, she became numb, she couldn't speak or move her arms; patients came and got better.24 Nadira's relationship with her zinn is a reciprocal and enmeshed one, rather than one of dominance and submis sion. She can call them when she wants to, provided she has followed their instructions. As I mentioned above, the time when she stops seeing patients is not fixed: The zinn leave at no set time. But how many patients she sees, how long she can give the zinn shelter, Nadira told me, depends on her shoril (body, health), how shokti (strong) it is.25 Possess ing a spirit is uncomfortable for Nadira. Even talking about the zinn made her suffer, Nadira told us, explaining her reti cence to discuss any more about the details of her spirit pos session. The relationship between spirit possession and agency is paradoxical. Whereas being taken over by the spirit in volves a displacement of the host's consciousness, the spirit may expand the host's personal agency by legitimating the host's voice (Lambek 1993, 2000). lames Wilce's (1998, 2000) spirit medium, Shefali, is a case in point. Shefali has a rep utation among local villagers for offering curative advice on Thursday nights when she enters into a trance state. During trance, Shefali becomes the object of the subject spirit, with the spirit-Shefali referring to Shefali in the third person: "They have come for my 'patient' [i.e., Shefali]. No touch ing [or coming] close to my wgi [patient]" (Wilce 1998:54). Shefali refers to her trance states as her "illness rising," a time when she lacks consciousness and is not present. Yet, in a similar fashion to Nadira, who summons her zinn through prayer, Shefali can control when her illness rises: Only after she performs 15 minutes of zikir, rhythmically re peating the name of Allah with every breath, does her trance state-spirit take over. The spirit enables Shefali to behave and speak in ways that normally she could not. Once when she was in a trance, the spirit-Shefali gleefully described how she?the spirit or Shefali?pushed Shefali's husband over in the rice fields because he forgot to perform one of the obligatory five daily prayers (Wilce 2000:19). In the sense that her newly found assertiveness can be regarded as a sign of health, Wilce (1998:56) notes the blurring of the line between illness and health. Shefali's spirit posses sion straddles the dichotomies of health and illness, healer and patient, and being an active agent and being acted on. Note that in the context of Islamic female piety, suffering is not necessarily diametrically opposed to having agency. One submits oneself to the struggle of achieving piety in the same way that the budding virtuoso pianist submits her self to a painful disciplinary regime of practice to play the instrument with mastery, to achieve the requisite agency (Mahmood 2005:29). Unlike Shefali's, Nadira's consciousness is not dis placed during possession: She is present during her "clinic" times. However, I did notice a subtle change in her phys iognomy and mannerisms when she was possessed: She became slightly more animated and robotic. Every day the zinn left dramatically: Nadira's arms made jerky movements and she emitted throaty sounds before slumping in her chair, apparently unconscious. Shuli Firani The dramatic exit of the zinn may have made Nadira the slightly more convincing of the two firanis to local people. As the departure of Nadira's spiritual power was unambigu ous, she did not have the problem of refusing to see patients that Shuli had. It was not uncommon for patients who had been unsuccessful in seeing Nadira to get on the bus and head for Shuli's house. They often arrived after the midday 482</page><page sequence="8">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh American Ethnologist prayer, however, by which time Shuli's power had also left her. After repeatedly explaining this to patients to no avail, an exasperated Shuli, her voice hoarse from a heavy morn ing's work (and feeling, perhaps, insulted if she suspected that she was their second choice of healer), would give in and agree to treat them, with the caveat that the treatment would not be as effective. What follows is Shuli's story of how she started see ing patients. I obtained the material from several interviews with Shuli, carried out over a few weeks. Some details were added by her mother. I have pieced the material together to present in chronological order but have tried to preserve Shuli's style and vocabulary. Shuli's father, a tailor, died in 1978, when Shuli was less than two years old. He had been ill for some time with a swollen abdomen and was vomiting blood, but the family were very poor and could not afford proper medical atten tion. In the same year that he died, her mother married her husband's brother.26 She has one older sister who has been given in marriage, and three half brothers and three half sis ters. The eldest brother lives in Dubai.27 Shuli had been a very good student. Every day after the dusk prayer, she studied her schoolbooks until midnight, when she read ozifa (a condensed version of the Qur'an) until the early hours of the morning. When she went mad around the time of taking her school-leaving exams, every body said it was because she studied so hard. Shuli went mad on Shob-i-Borat night in 1993.28 As usual, she went to the local bathing pond to perform ozu (ritual ablutions before prayer) before the dusk prayer. However, she did not return to the house and was miss ing for several hours. It was not until three o'clock in the morning that her family found her, still in the pond. Having stepped into the pond, she had been unable to get out and had gone completely underwater. It was the wintertime; she was so cold that, after the family had pulled her out of the water, they dressed her in three sets of silwar kameez (loose fitting trousers and tunics). They could not under stand what she was saying: She spoke in Hindi and Arabi. She remained mad for six months: Every day she stayed in the pond; at night, people forced her to come into the house, but if she could open the doors she would return to the pond and swim and submerge herself completely un derwater. During the time underwater, she saw many beau tiful things that she had never before seen in this (mortal) world, including Kwaz Fir, the saint of water.29 She fasted every day, just taking water, and refused to eat a meal. She would lie in the sun for hours and did not dress mod estly. When she was very mad, she would sweep the whole house until the early hours of the morning; on one occa sion, she swept up seven grains of rice and told her mother that she would eat them if her mother cooked them for her. On another occasion, after sweeping up some leaves, she set fire to them; remarkably, the leaves remained burn ing. One day she climbed a thorny tree and fell without hurting herself. During the first few weeks of her madness, her fam ily tried to get her illness treated. They first approached a local doctor, who prescribed sleeping tablets and an injec tion; although Shuli took the medication, it did not make her sleep. Next, they brought a mullah to see her, but she kicked him. At this point, they were going to take her to see a specialist doctor, but her mother's paternal uncle recom mended a fir who lived on the other side of Sylhet town, a 1.5-hour journey away by two buses. The fir, a lengta fir, at first said that nothing had happened to her. But when her family protested that she was doing a lot of mad things, he said that she would get better and that "those things that are with her are bigger than me," implying that a spiritual power was with her that was more powerful than his own. After that, they looked after her at home.30 At times, she was so mad that she had to be tied up. She hit people; she knocked out two of her mother's front teeth, and her mother still has the scar where Shuli bit her on her arm. When she was tied up, she saw all the fish at the Shah Jalal shrine go over her head, and all of Shah Jalal's olis came to see her and told her to pray a lot. One morning at 3 or 4 a.m., when Shuli was sweep ing around the back of the house, she felt that a stone was pressing inside her belly. Then she noticed that a large black stone, about a foot high, was standing in front of her. While she was mad, she often heard the prophets talk to her at night; now it seemed that they were telling her to put the stone into her belly. It felt like the stone was pressing on her belly. She did not know how the stone came to be next to her but remembered that it had been in the pond with her on Shob-i-Borat night. One day, shortly after finding the stone, she ran and fetched her father's large scissors and told her mother that she would cut off all her own hair. She twisted the hair around four matches and left them on a betel-nut tray. A few days' later, she called her mother to look at the hair. The hair had increased in volume and had become matted. Her mother, incredulous, thought that Shuli had added other people's hair to her own. However, Shuli asked her mother to comb her hair (i.e., the hair that was still on Shuli's head) and to keep the hair from the comb in a polythene bag. A few days later, her mother saw that, as before, the hair had increased in volume and had matted. On seeing the hair, Shuli cried out in joy, "I've found good [spiritual] things." From then on, her mother realized that Shuli, indeed, had found something good.31 Then Shuli dreamed that she should bury the hair three hands deep and put the stone on top of it. She also felt she heard the prophets telling her to cut her henna-dyed fingernails and to place them next to the stone.32 She buried her miraculous things?the hair and the fingernails?three hands deep under the stone and planted a coconut tree on 493</page><page sequence="9">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 top of the stone. By this time, a lot of people were coming to the family's house, leaving money and other gifts next to where the stone lay. Shuli found peace in her heart whenever she went near the stone; when people lit candles and made a wish in front of the stone, their wishes were fulfilled. However, some of the local people were jealous and said it was a con. Out of enmity, they dug the stone up (they were unable to find the hair) and threw it back into the pond where Shuli had bathed on Shob-i-Borat night. A lot of people searched for the stone but were unable to find it. She had a dream that, if her spiritual calling were genuine, she would find the stone. Shuli prayed a lot and read the Qur'an; once when she was reading the Qur'an in the early hours of the morning, she felt that there were a lot of white stones around her, but when she finished reading, she looked up and saw only her black stone; she understood then that the stone was charmed. A few days later, her maternal grandfather found the stone, having knocked his foot against it while he was doing ozu in the pond. He had broken a toenail and, not wanting others to injure themselves, fished the stone out and told Shuli's mother that he had left it on the bank. Shuli's mother fetched it and brought it back to the house. Shuli dreamed that the stone should be kept in a beau tiful place: a clean and tidy place where people could pray, fast, and recite the Qur'an. She dreamed that she should build a mukam (tomb, shrine) and place the stone and other miraculous things inside it.33 Accordingly, her mother had the shrine built for her on the original site where she had planted the coconut tree (see Figures 1-3) ,34 (Shuli found the fingernails and hair where she had buried them, but they had gone another eight or nine hands deeper.) Figure 1. Shuli Firani's mukam from the outside. The woman crouching at the door is described locally as fagol (mad). Shuli has not attempted to give her treatment because she thinks the woman's brain is irreversibly damaged. Photo by A. Callan. Figure 2. Shuli's mukam. Her stone and other miraculous things are kept behind the door. Photo by A. Callan. When Shuli was mad, she told her family to look af ter other mad people. At first, they had mad people in to stay with them, and Shuli instructed her mother to do ev erything for them, including cleaning up their urine and fe ces, but this proved to be too arduous, and Shuli no longer has patients living in her house. When she was mad, people visited her and found that her prophecies came true. From that beginning, more people came; some people took leaves and bark from Shuli's grapefruit tree and found them to be beneficial.35 In 1997, Shuli noticed a ricelike plant growing up the wall of the mukam. Miraculously, it was growing from the stone floor. Her maternal aunt wanted to pluck it out and throw it away, but she was unable to. Neither could she stub it out with a smoldering incense stick. Day by day, the flower got bigger and by the 18th day, it was com pletely in flower. It first flowered on the first day of the lu nar month. At night, a light shone from the flower that was so bright that no other light was necessary in the mukam until midnight. During the day, water fell from the flower, but if anybody wanted the water to stop, it would. The night before the plant flowered, Shuli dreamed that somebody re cited the following poem to her: "Nobiye dexiya/nuror bi tre raxiya/shoto dua lexi/dilay shunar Modinay" [Having 484</page><page sequence="10">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet Bangladesh American Ethnologist Figure 3. By 2003, Shuli had extended her mukam, according to a dream. The Bengali writing on the archway refers to the holy fish at the Shah Jalal shrine. Shuli dreamed that people with matted hair should cut their hair off and place it in her mukam. It would then vanish, having been transported to the Shah Jalal shrine. Photo by A. Callan. seen the prophets/Having kept the light inside/I write a hundred prayers/You gave them to golden Medina]. Later, Shuli dreamed that she was the flower; in that dream, she learned that she should not practice healing after the mid day prayer. Shuli had the flower photographed and keeps an enlarged framed copy hung on the wall of her mukam. Discussion Unlike the mythological narratives told by local people, Shuli and her close associates did not attribute Shuli's power to a zinn that had become temporarily affiliated with her. Her mother explained, She has no zinn or deo [type of zinn that frequents ponds] with her. There is nothing bigheaded about her. She is not proud. She has no greed for food. We took her to Dhaka to shop but she had no interest and she didn't buy anything. During the day she is for people; at night she is for Allah. Women can't get saintly power, but those that Allah loves he gives miraculous power to. Denying that her daughter has a zinn, Shuli's mother goes on to imply that Shuli has a more direct connection with Allah: Allah has specially chosen her because of her re ligiosity; Allah has given the miraculous power directly to her, not sent it via a zinn. A male friend of the family, a local high school teacher, who had become Shuli's "guardian" after her father died, had his own explanation. Like her mother, the guardian was quick to emphasize that she had no saintly power or zinn with her. Instead, she had become mad when she had gone to his house and stepped on his family's mukam; his forefathers were firs and one of his in-laws is related to Roxmotgong Fir.36 When I saw Shuli alone, I reminded her of her guardian's explanation, but she dismissed it ("If people want to think that, let them think it"). I wondered if she be lieved that there really was a zinn with her. Once, she spent the night in her mukam, awaking to find that the skin of her fingers had been "eaten." She never slept again in the mukam. She left food in the mukam?a banana and bread? but it remained untouched. I asked her what she thought had eaten her fingers: She smiled enigmatically, nodding thoughtfully, playing for time as she tried to think of a reply that would be both polite and unrevealing. She answered fi nally, "It was another thing, a miraculous thing." Most intriguing of all in Shuli's account is the discov ery of the "miraculous" stone. Shuli's stone reminded me of the famous black stone that is kept in the Ka'ba in Mecca, the black cubic structure toward which all Muslims pray.37 Part of the hoz (hajj) rituals involve circumambulating the Ka'ba and kissing the stone or blowing a kiss toward the stone. According to the Hadith, the black stone had been a white jewel in paradise (cf. Shuli seeing white stones that appeared to turn into her black one) ; when it fell to earth to gether with Adam, it became black with human sin. Adam placed it in the original Ka'ba. When Abraham rebuilt the Ka'ba, the angel Gabriel retrieved the black stone from the Meccan mountains, where it had been hidden at the time of the Flood: "Just as the Black Stone is material symbol of God's covenant with man, so also is the Ka'ba the 'navel', the center of the foundation of the world; it stands on the seventh earth in a direct line below God's throne in seventh heaven, and as angels circumambulate God's throne, so do humans circumambulate the Ka'ba" (Stowasser 1994:48). I wondered to what extent Shuli felt that, by acquiring the stone and building a shrine around it, she was establishing a second sacred center away from Mecca.38 But Shuli did more than simply discover the stone: She felt it pressing in side her belly: She gave birth to it. And it is a sacred center that excludes men. Shuli forbids men from entering her mukam. Nowa days, she told us, men in Bangladesh were not good; she did not trust them. If she allowed them into her room, they might be impolite or want to spoil her (rape her). She would not be able to escape because there is only one door. If men touched her, she would not like it?she would become im pure.39 She used to walk to school because, if she got on the bus, men could pull and push her. Neither do any of her male relatives enter the mukam. Once, a brother-in-law slept in the mukam because the family had many guests to accommodate in the house. He dreamed that somebody threw him out of the mukam by his hair, and he has been too frightened to go in since. Shuli asked him if he had made himself impure by getting up to 415</page><page sequence="11">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 urinate in the night and not performing ozu properly. He confirmed that this had been the case.40 Shuli does not generally receive clients in her mukam; consultations are carried out in her family's house, after which she may send the client to pray at the mukam, a few yards away from her house. I once arrived at her house to hear Shuli loudly reciting?almost shouting?the mid day prayer from her mukam. When she finished praying, she emerged with three other women who lived in Sylhet town (judging from their attire, they were very wealthy). Shuli's vocalization of prayer surprised me: In Bangladesh it is considered sinful for women, but not for men, to vocalize Qur'anic verse, as they may distract men with the beguiling beauty of the female voice.41 Shuli refuses to see men in her house who come un accompanied by a female relative.42 Women sometimes at tend on behalf of their male relatives. When this happens, Shuli encourages them to bring the male relative with them the next time, as she prefers to treat the patient in person. When men do attend, accompanied by a female relative, they seem to require a more complex plan of treatment than the female patients do. Shuli often asks her female patients to bring water, sugar, or another commonly available sub stance (usually from their own homes) with them on the next visit so Shuli can make them holy by doing foo. But she asked a middle-aged man presenting with chronic pain throughout his body to bring water from the Surma River, black pepper, ewe's and sheep's blood ("If it's not available at present, wait for the next Qurbanir Eid"), a scented can dle, materials (a metallic cover and string) to make a tabiz, seven types of plant leaf, and three types of root. In addition, she instructed him to read passages from the holy scrip tures every day ("If it's very long I won't be able to do it, give me a short piece," he pleaded). Her diagnosis was that his rib cage had become impure: "You urinated in a place and became impure." The man retorted that he was not at fault, that it was by Allah's command that he had fallen ill. He sometimes lost consciousness and did not understand anything: This is what had happened when he went to the mosque and urinated there. When I returned to Bangladesh in April 2003,1 found Shuli to be much the same as before: She was still living in the same place and practicing as a firani. I could tell that she had lost a lot of weight. I was astonished to learn that she had got married a few months earlier.43 Her husband is a mullah and madrassah teacher in another county. (See Figure 4.) Shuli's account of her marriage is as follows: Her hus band had been working in Saudi Arabia. He was at Mecca performing the hoz rituals when he had a dream that he would marry an honest and very pious woman. On return ing home, he asked around and finally found Shuli. Mean while, Shuli had also had a dream about him. She saw his face at Mecca and was told not to refuse his marriage offer. Figure 4. Shuli in 2003 with her husband. Shuli usually wears white or pale-colored saris but changed into the one shown here for the purposes of the photograph. Shuli had no objection to her photograph being taken for academic purposes. Photo by A. Callan. On getting Shuli's agreement to marriage, her future hus band approached Shuli's mother and stepfather with a for mal proposal. The marriage was settled. A Muslim mar riage contract was drawn up. According to Shuli's wishes, it specified that, for the first 12 years of marriage, Shuli could remain at her parents' house (this arrangement had been revealed to Shuli in a dream). For 40 days before the wedding, Shuli prayed a lot. The wedding was a low-key affair: Only immediate members of the two families were invited, and Shuli was simply dressed. Shuli had wanted a simple wedding, as she believes that she is liable to go mad at big events. She cried all day until dusk, when she lost consciousness. According to the usual wedding program, she was taken to her husband's house. She remained un conscious for four hours with her teeth tightly clenched. A learned mullah was called. He gave her honey and advised her to always stay at her parents' house. Shuli remained for three days at her husband's house before returning home. During her stay at her husband's house, she lost a lot of blood vaginally, and for this reason, Shuli believes she lost a lot of weight.44 Out of politeness, Shuli had visited her in-laws' again on Qurbanir Eid but did not stay very long 416</page><page sequence="12">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh American Ethnologist because she started to feel ill again. Shuli told me that her in-laws do not mind that she does not live with them: They are young and understanding. Her husband visits her once a month and stays for a day or two.45 To what extent can Shuli's status as a firani be re garded as counterhegemonic? There are several ways in which Shuli's practice inverts patriarchal social norms. First, Shuli's rule prohibiting men from entering her mukam reverses the practice in Bangladesh of prohibiting postpu bertal girls and women from attending the mosque. This rule is partly predicated on the associations Shuli makes be tween men and impurity. Whereas men are admonished not to allow droplets of urine to contaminate their clothing lest they undo ozu (Wilce 2000:11), women are more profoundly associated with impurity in Bangladeshi ideology. Second, Shuli's insistence on seeing male clients only if they are ac companied by a female relative is a reversal of the common (rural) practice of male healers expecting to see female pa tients accompanied by their male guardians.46 Third, Shuli loudly vocalizes Qur'anic verse. Fourth, Shuli does not com ply with the virilocal rule of residence. As mentioned both in her own story of how she ob tained her healing powers and in the local narratives that mythologized her power, Shuli's firani status only met with outside resistance in the early stages of her development as a healer. Her current popularity across all social class and gender groups suggests that she is not considered a threat to the dominant order. Significantly, her family and local people stressed her piety, specifically, her rigorous attention to purdah, expressed in the way she dressed and restricted her movements to the confines of her own courtyard. Un like some of her male counterparts, Shuli did not travel around the country attending, for example, uras celebra tions. When she went to the local bazaar to receive phone calls from her British Bangladeshi clients, she dressed in a white burqa and traveled the two-minute journey in a rick shaw accompanied by her mother. Can Shuli's firani sta tus be regarded as an "accommodating protest" (MacLeod 1992), with her challenges to patriarchal social norms offset by her compliance with purdah? Individuals do simultane ously comply and resist in their negotiations with patriar chal and Islamic ideologies (Huq 2006; Torab 1996). Such heteroglossia may, in itself, be an act of resistance against the monologic discourse of the dominant order (Bakhtin 1981:367; Knauft 1996:188). However, viewing Shuli's piety as an accommodation to patriarchy implies that female Islamic piety reinforces women's subordination. This notion needs to be unpacked. Concealing the whole body with clothing is not, in it self, an act of submission to male authority. Hijab-wearing women in Zanzibar have been compared to ninja, the black-clothed assassins of lapanese films (Parkin 1995:209). Saba Mahmood (2005:16) points out that analysts have of fered a variety of sociological interpretations for the resur gence in veiling while neglecting to attend to informants' view of the practice: that is, engagement in piety for piety's sake. Shuli dresses modestly because it is Allah's command: She told us that women who failed to keep their heads cov ered would be punished on Judgment Day, when scorpi ons and snakes would bite their brains. Explanations that go beyond the conscious statements of informants inter pret the burqa in Bangladesh as conferring high social status and economic security (Gardner 1995:218-219) and making women responsible for the containment of men's sexual passions (Shehabuddin 1999a). Wearing a burqa is polys?mie and cannot be reduced to a single explanation. Critics also commonly argue that another aspect of purdah, restricting women's mobility, limits their economic power, as they are denied access to the public sphere of work. Shuli was more successful than many of the male firs I met: She had a very large number of clients (who brought donations) and enjoyed a widespread reputation. Her economic suc cess was intrinsically bound up with her restricted mobility: Her reputation as a firani was at least partly predicated on her attention to purdah. "Agency" is itself a culturally constructed concept. The assumption that all women desire freedom from structures of male domination may be ethnocentric. In her study of a women's mosque movement in Cairo, Mahmood (2005) shows that, although the women's efforts to achieve piety sometimes brought them into conflict with male authority, they undertook these efforts in the name of Allah and not as resistance against patriarchy. Shuli's resistance to the vir ilocal rule of residence is enacted both in the name of Al lah and as resistance against patriarchy. The significance of Shuli staying at her natal home following marriage cannot be overstated. A new bride in her husband's household is ex pected to defer not only to the authority of her husband and parents-in-law but also to her husband's brothers (and their wives) and to any remaining unmarried sisters. The new bride's status improves with the birth of children, especially sons, and she can expect to wield power over daughters in-law many years later, when her own sons marry. This cyclical nature of women's power has been described as a patriarchal bargain in which women internalize patriarchal values (Kandiyoti 1988). Had Shuli remained in her hus band's home, her firani practice probably would have been overshadowed by her husband's status as a mullah, as the local mullah is often the first port of call for treatment of ill ness and other problems requiring spiritual advice. Shuli's agency in resisting the virilocal rule of residence derived from outside herself: Before marriage, she dreamed that she should remain at her natal home (according to local cos mology, dreams are put there by Allah, especially in the case of saints), and following marriage, the mullah she consulted for ill health told her to stay at her own parents' house. Shuli's resistance to the virilocal rule of residence was le gitimized by Islam. In this case, Islam was not diametrically 407</page><page sequence="13">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 opposed to feminism but supported one woman's emanci pation from structures of male authority. A counterhegemonic healing practice? Fatimi Mernissi likens the role of the saint in Morocco to that of the psychiatrist in a capitalist society "channelling discontent into the therapeutic process and thus depriv ing it of its potential to combat the formal power structure" (1975:112). Although Moroccan saints' shrines offer women a public arena for airing grievances, women's investment in a superhuman force does not affect the formal power structure: In offering the hope of a solution, the saints help women adjust to the oppression of the system. A similar situation exists in Bangladesh. The fir's con sulting chamber and waiting room gives women a space to articulate problems outside the confines of the family that they may not otherwise have. Aysha is a regular client of Ashon Fir. Unhappily married, she felt tricked into marry ing her husband, whom she later discovered already had another wife. Her husband now works abroad. One of her complaints is that her husband does not send any money to her, only to the cowife. (Aysha and the cowife live in the same household but have separate rooms.) The fir's diag nosis is that Aysha's problem is not her husband's fault but that of the cowife, who has done sorcery to spoil his brain. This may be the opinion Aysha wanted to hear, and it offers short-term comfort, but blaming the cowife avoids the issue of gender inequalities. Are the firanis better placed than the male firs to of fer healing that is counterhegemonic to prevailing patriar chal structures? Nadira's approach to her patients' prob lems did not differ greatly from that of the firs. A woman complained to Nadira that her husband stayed away from home most of the time and that, when he did return home, the two of them quarreled all the time: Could Nadira give her something to resolve this problem? Nadira obliged, writ ing a tabiz and instructing the woman to place it under her husband's pillow. Like Nadira, Shuli places her faith in the superhuman healing properties of tabiz and fani fora. However, some of her consultations may have the effect of raising awareness in her patients about local gender inequalities. Shuli told us that one of the commonest problems that people con sult her for is lack of harmony between husband and wife. A wife will come to her for treatment because the husband does not like her and the husband's family has done a tabiz (in this context, a bad magic spell) to get the husband to divorce her. In blaming the husband's family, Shuli is re versing the more common perception in Sylheti culture that the son's wife is to blame for family problems. In doing so, she is flagging a structural problem for women, the virilocal rule of residence, which places the new bride as an outsider and a potential sorcerer. I was once present when a woman whose husband worked abroad complained to Shuli that her husband did not contact her or send her any money. Shuli asked the woman to return in a week's time bringing water from a large vessel and turmeric; in the meantime, she would see if anybody had done anything (i.e., commit ted sorcery) or if the husband had gone bad on his own ac cord. Here, Shuli at least raised the possibility that the hus band might be responsible for failing to support his wife. Conclusion Unlike that of the female south Indian healer described by Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger (2006), Shuli's and Nadira's healing power is not contingent on being married to a pir. Rather, their saintly power is attributed to a supernat ural entity that is temporarily affiliated with them. They differ in this respect from their male counterparts, whose saintly authority is perceived as an attribute of the individ ual, achieved through lifelong scholarship and blood ties to a saintly lineage. It would be misleading to reduce this dif ference to an example of distinct, gendered domains of re ligious practice, with men studying the Qu'ran and women trafficking with spirits, as in Sylhet, male healers also prac tice with the aid of spirits. The meaning of Islam is context dependent and revised through practice. Islam may be put to both radical and re actionary ends. The fatwa has been used to oppress women in Bangladesh (Shehabuddin 1999b). Yet it is not surpris ing that Islamic idioms are drawn on in this?or any other context?as local culture is steeped in Islam. Local Islam has given the firanis careers as spiritual healers. For these poor village women, an Islamic framework is more acces sible than a secular university education. Shuli Firani drew on Islam to resist the virilocal rule of residence, a patriar chal structure that underpins women's subordination. Is lam cannot be reduced to patriarchy. But Islam is never neu tral because it does not exist outside its point of application: It only has meaning through practice. Notes Acknowledgments. This article would not have been possible without the help of Nadira and Shuli, who gave their time so generously and allowed me to observe their healing practices. Thanks also to my research assistant, Tahmida Akther Chowdhury (Shoma), to Roland Littlewood and Mukulika Banerjee for reading draft versions, and to three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. The research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. 1. I represent Sylheti words using Rod Chalmers's (1996) pho netic transliteration conventions, which are derived from Radice 1994. 2. As well as seven firanis, I met two other female professional healers: one Hindu kobiraj (herbalist) and one Muslim hakim (practitioner of Unani medicine). The latter was married to another 408</page><page sequence="14">Female saints and the practice of Islam in Sylhet, Bangladesh American Ethnologist hakim; she worked in her consulting rooms at home either alone or with her husband. 3. Some of the men may have been accompanying their wives, rather than coming with their own problems. Even if the former was more frequently the case, it nevertheless suggested that they sanctioned their wives' visits to see her. 4. Nadira's mother told me that her daughter had been seeing patients for eight years. This seemed to be an overestimate, as ev erybody was clear that Shuli had started practicing first, perhaps one to two years before Nadira. 5. Living female saints may be a phenomenon restricted to the Sylhet district. South of Sylhet, in Chittagong, women seeking help for infertility problems visit the shrine of a woman raped and mur dered by a police officer 50-60 years ago. Saintly power, however, was not attributed to the woman, a cook who worked for the police, until the man who murdered her died the year after the incident took place (FaridAhamed, personal communication 1999). The po etry of a 19th-century Sylheti female saint survives today (James Lloyd-Williams, personal communication 2000). 6. I spent 23 months there in 1999-2001 and two further one month periods, in 2003 and 2005. 7. Nadira, unlike Shuli, took Fridays off. I use pseudonyms throughout to protect informants' confidentiality. 8. Shah Jalal is feted as having brought Islam to the Indian sub continent in the 14th century. His master in Mecca gave him a clump of soil and instructed him to wander throughout the world until he found a place whose soil corresponded to it. Not until he reached Sylhet did he find an exact match (Eaton 1993:212-213). 9. See, for example, Landell-Mills 1998 and other contributions to Werbner and Basu 1998. 10. Asim Roy (1983) notes that the term Sufism was not used in early Bengal Islam. Although, today, they rarely explicitly refer to Sufism, Sylheti Muslims do embrace Sufi theosophy in their belief that the mortally dead saint is still alive but rendered invisible by Al lah, who has placed a veil between the saint and the material world. Firs who are connected to Sufi lodges attend uras celebrations com memorating the death anniversaries of saints. 11. The complete continuum reads, from least to most powerful, as follows: mullah, fir, oli, nobi (prophet), rasul (divine messenger), and, finally, the Prophet Muhammad. See Eaton 1993:303. 12. Landell-Mills (1998) points out that pir is Persian for old man. 13. All body fluids, including blood, semen, and sputum, are re garded as polluting. Hence, men may also be impure, but they have control over their sources of impurity, whereas women do not (Marcus 1984). Note that female ascetics who become amenorrheic through fasting (Elias 1988) also have control. According to a judg ment based on the Hadith (the Prophet's sayings), menstruation that never ceases or a chronic vaginal discharge does not preclude a woman from taking part in Islamic rituals (Glasse 1991:267). 14. When referring to Allah, one uses the third-person polite pro noun, which, in Sylheti (and standard Bengali), is genderless. 15. I wondered if Nadira's and her mother's reluctance to use the term zinn, to always substitute pronouns, was out of deference to the zinn. 16. Nazima was the only informant who used the term mondir when referring to Shuli's mukam (shrine). Mondir always implies a Hindu temple. 17. There is no definitive version of any mythic story; oral nar ratives are reconstructed anew each time. M. M. Bakhtin viewed each articulation of a myth as a rejoinder in an unfinalized di alogue, reflecting the "heteroglossia of ideological possibilities" (Werbner 1990:7). I wondered if Nazima's detail about the firani be ing adopted reflected her own situation. At the time she told the story, she was staying at her employer's house, seeking sanctuary from her parents after her father had been seen searching for her and wielding an ax. She had angered him after she had taken a property case against him to the local village council. 18. Werbner's third feature is instantaneous achievement of eso teric knowledge. That Nadira and Shuli could write Arabi after be coming firanis but not before was taken as evidence of their saintly power. In Sylheti, Arabi refers to either the Arabic language or, in this context, lines from the Qur'an. 19. The aunt's pain improved with the foo, tabiz, and tel fora (oil for massage made holy through foo being done over it) that Shuli gave her; it had not improved after treatment from a university medical graduate. 20. Men's private attitudes toward spirit possession may differ from their public pronouncements. Men may enjoy vicarious par ticipation in spirit cults, paying for their wives to take part (Lewis 1996; Nisula 1999). Vincent Crapanzano's (1980) Tuhami, who was "married" to his female spirit, was marginalized as an outsider in his Moroccan town. 21. Neither Shoma nor I had ever seen this practice before, al though we had heard about it from the family of a spirit-possessed woman. Shoma thought that perhaps the fir had caught sight of the zinn and was trying to beat the zinn out of the patient. The treat ment "worked": The woman, who had been causing a nuisance by rolling around on the floor of the fir's waiting room all morning, her hair disheveled, singing rowdily and incessantly about procur ing a Londoni husband, curled up in a ball after the beating and remained quiet until her husband and father came to reclaim her. Another patient of the fir confirmed that his usual treatment for spirit possession was to touch the sufferer lightly on both shoulders with his stick. 22. Bokra Eid, also known as Qurbanir Eid, is known elsewhere in the Muslim world as the Feast of Sacrifice; it marks Abraham's intention to sacrifice his son. 23. A burning body and a hot head are complaints commonly taken to a psychiatrist but are not necessarily associated with being mad. See Callan 2005. 24. Shelter is a fairly common word for spirit possession. In this context it has the added meaning that Nadira will provide protec tion for the zinn. 25. When a woman's shoril is bad (karaf), it usually means that she is menstruating. I did not get the opportunity to ask Nadira how menstruation affected her spiritual power. 26. The custom that a man marry his brother's widow (levirate) is fairly common but not compulsory in Bangladesh. 27. Shuli added that it cost over 100,000 taka ($2,500) to send him there. The money probably came from Shuli's earnings as a firani. Shuli did not explicitly charge for her services, but all of her clients seemed to leave a gift, usually in the form of money but sometimes biscuits or cakes. 28. This night marks the sighting of the full moon 14 days before the start of Ramadan. As it is the night when destinies are fixed for the coming year, many Muslims pray all day in the hope of being blessed by Allah. 29. Th?r?se Blanchet (1984) questions the orthodox origins of this fir and notes that his role as guardian of the rivers is not one that is attributed to him in the Muslim world outside Bengal. 30. The family remained in contact with the fir. The fir proposed marriage to Shuli, but Shuli declined, saying that he had become like a brother to her; she said she would pray for him. He subse quently got married and now has a son. 31. Matted hair is associated with spiritual-healing powers in Sylhet and elsewhere in South Asia; for the Sri Lankan context, see Obeyesekere 1981. 400</page><page sequence="15">American Ethnologist Volume 35 Number 3 August 2008 32. It was Ramadan, and on the 26th and 27th days of that month, it is customary to apply henna to the fingernails. 33. Shoma asked Shuli why she called the structure a "mukam": Was there a body buried there? Shuli replied that there was not, it was just where she kept her miraculous things. She would be buried there only if she had a dream that indicated that she should be. 34. She learned from the dream the shape and color of the shrine; originally, it was white. Later, one of her clients painted the colors and the flowers on it after he had a dream telling him to do so. Recently, Shuli has had another dream in which the mukam was taller and her miraculous things were buried in the corner, her stone was placed on the ground above them, and a shelf, on which the Qur'an sat, was fixed above the stone. She plans to rebuild the mukam accordingly. 35. The story behind Shuli's grapefruit tree is as follows: When Shuli was still at school, she fasted for 18 days. Instead of break ing her fast at sunset with the usual ifta food, she gave the food to her cat. Her mother was very angry, took off her sandal, and hit her with it. A few days later, the cat fell in the pond and died. Shuli fished the cat's swollen corpse out of the pond and threw it in the sand. A few days later, she saw the cat's body on the steps of the pond. Again, she threw it in the sand, but, again, the cat's body reappeared on the steps of the pond. After this happened for the third time, she told her family that they should make a kobor (grave) for the cat and perform zaniza (a funeral service). A few days later, Shuli's mother found her washing the cat's severed head on the pond's steps with Lux soap. Shuli said that she had found "some very good things." They made a grave for the cat's head under the grapefruit tree. 36. Accidentally stepping on a saint's shrine is commonly given as a reason for going mad: The offended saint punishes the cul prit by sending him or her mad. That Shuli recovered to find herself in possession of healing powers demonstrates the ultimately good natured power of the saint in this case. In putting forward this ex planation, the guardian is making a claim for his personal involve ment in her success. 37. Shuli's stone is roughly the same dimensions and color of the Meccan black stone. 38. When I asked Shuli if there was any connection between her black stone and the one at Mecca, she nodded and said that she had dreamed that the Prophet had given her the stone (she had had this dream before finding the stone). 39. When I asked Shuli about her marriage plans, she said whether she married was up to Allah. 40. Shuli does not enter the mukam when she is menstruating. She dreams when her period will start; it only lasts one or two days. 41. Shoma thought that Shuli was demonstrating her piety to me and making the assumption that I was ignorant about Islamic rules. This explanation did not ring true to me. 42. I was present when an unaccompanied young man turned up complaining of breathing problems. "Bring your mother," Shuli told him. "I've got no mother or elder sister," he replied, "I'm the eldest." "Bring a sasi [paternal uncle's wife] or a xala [mother's sis ter]." After he had said he had nobody to bring, Shuli gave him the following advice: "After breathing, break a leaf in two; throw one piece in the east direction, one piece in the west direction. Now, off you go. I don't want to speak with you about the problem, only with your relative." 43. Shoma was not surprised: "She's a Bangladeshi girl." Shoma had always told me that, although marriage was a scary prospect for a woman, not getting married was even scarier. 44. When Shoma asked Shuli if she wanted to have children, Shuli replied, "No, sister, that hasn't happened yet." 45. This arrangement remained in place when I visited her in September 2005. 46. I am grateful to one of the anonymous reviewers for pointing this out to me. References cited Ahamed, Farid Uddin 2006 Trends and Strategies of Islamization in Chittagong, Bangladesh.
