Introduction The past two decades of cave and open-site archaeology in Western Borneo (Sara- wak, Brunei and Sabah) have produced several interesting or peculiar sorts of prehis- toric pottery. These have been discussed in a series of papers by the present writer and others over the years, largely in the Sarawak Museum Journal, Journal Malaysian Branch Royal Asiatic Society , and elsewhere. Particular attention has been paid to what W.G. Solheim has termed "phallic-tops", first identified in the great Sarawak River delta open-sites of between 700 and 1,350 A.D. (Solheim, 1965; Harrisson and O'Connor, 1969;), and subsequently identified as far afield as Fiji out in the eastern Pacific where they have been associated with a carbon-14 date about 1,290 b.c. (T. Harrisson, 1969). Similarly identified in Borneo and subsequently extended as far East as Fiji, is the so- 35</page><page sequence="2">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 called "turtle-ware", first described from a cave on the Segama Paver in Sabah at the north-east corner of Borneo (T. Harrisson, 1965, 1966, 1969). Another striking form of ware from this sector has been classed as a "three-colour ware" though this may belong more clearly to the wider mainland tradition associated with Sa-huynh pottery (Solheim, B. Harrisson and Wall, 1959)? It is found in quanti- ties at Niah and it has also been located elsewhere in northern Borneo, including in a very small neolithic cave on the little island of Pulau Burong, off Labuan in Brunei Bay (T. and B. Harrisson, 1971: 123, 195). Associated with the three-colour ware are some huge, wide uncoloured jars, some of which have been recovered more or less intact, as from the West Mouth of the Great Cave at Niah which has been under exacavation since 1954, with 166 full burials identified and described in detail (B. Harrisson, 1967). From one such jar, 69.5 cms. high with a maximal diameter of 66.8 cms., the contents have been dated between 1,330 and 1,120 b.c. Dating is of importance not only to the early pottery ceramic tradition of the area, but also to the introduction of the advanced concept of " secondary burial", that is the treatment of the dead body months or years later with reburial of bones or other parts in a vessel or some other special position- in this case in various forms of ceramic or wooden receptacle within the caves. As Barbara Harrisson has put it: The new date is also significant for the diverse range of Niah earthenwares of which our jar is a simple if impressive example. The range, including vessels incised with intricate designs highlighted in three colours, and beautifully burnished or polished double-spouted pots has now to be considered as approximately dated between 1,600 and 400 b.c. with a possible further margin both ways; and as a production incorporating the plain or haematited and paddle- decorated, and the more sophisticated in form or finish, side by side, over this long period of time. (B. Harrisson, 1968: 66; and see further at Section X following). The reference to double-spouted pots in the above quotation is one of the few in the literature so far. For they remain a further and hitherto quite neglected class. Like all the other ware so far mentioned, except the "phallic tops", origins appear to have been exclusively stone-age. The appearance of metal had dramatic technological effects in Borneo. It was associated with large scale import of other and more durable ceramic and metal forms, which replaced earthenware pottery for many purposes. Only the "phallic tops", interestingly, survived: indeed they have survived into very recent times, among the so-called Sea Gypsies, the Bajau people of northern Sabah and the Sulu Sea (Evans, 1955; Harrisson and O'Connor, 1969; cf. Sopher, 1965; Sather, 1971). Previous, only passing reference to the double-spouted vessels of the Borneo neolithic or late-stone age are in T.

Prehistoric Vessels Extracted from Niah Caves, Borneo The present paper will deal more extensively with this rather complicated and quite unexplored group of potteries and their period. Preparation was assisted by the help of Miss Lynn Patterson, then working with the U.S. Peace Corps, in Sarawak. She generously spent vacations from those duties working with me on a special analysis of double-spout problems. She also prepared, in the first stage, some of the excellent and accurate drawings of these vessels which are illustrated here, subsequently in part re- drawn for publication by Mrs. Carla Zainie and later photographed by Mrs. Christine Harrisson. Miss Patterson, who subsequently graduated from the University of Ohio and went on to the University of Washington, Seattle, has lately deserted archaeology for more contemporary fields of social research, alas. I remain grateful to her, not only for assistance at that time, but for continued kindness and interest since. This paper, then, in the first place gives a rather full description of these vessels (Sections II to VIII). In the second place, it will attempt to position them in an archae- ological context within the complex framework of Borneo Caves and associated culture (Sections IX to XI). Thirdly (Section XII) there is always the problem as to what ex- tent such concepts develop, possibly even originate, inside the insular Borneo stone-age itself; or (alternatively) to what extent, if any, they were influenced from outside - and if so, from where? Finally, a summary and bibliography. II. Frequency and Distribution of Double-spouted Vessels at Niah Caves Nearly all our information about prehistoric double-spouted vessels in Southeast Asia comes from the Sarawak Museum excavations which I planned and directed at Niah over many years (cf. also Section XII). All the artifacts from those excavations, including every double-spouted vessel, is now in the Sarawak Museum at Kuching. As already indicated above, double-spouted vessels differ from the other specialized early forms of earthenware pottery so far excavated in Borneo, in this localization. It is partly for this reason, - because they have not been encountered elsewhere, - that they have not hitherto been published or given attention they deserve. There is the added problem that since I retired from curatorship of the Museum in 1967, there have been difficulties in this area, delaying the working out of reports. As far as Niah itself is concerned, however, the major part of the excavations is complete. An abundance of spouted materials has been obtained not only initially from the Great Cave, but subse- quently from eight other caves of more than a dozen studied in the same limestone formation. This is therefore the appropriate moment to present a proper account of double-spouted vessels which by virtue partly of their particularity may give special insights into problems of Niah archaeology and the rich varied culture which grew up there, beginning before 20,000 years ago, continuing dynamically into historical times. These vessels cover only a narrow part of the whole spectrum of Niah life, but include perhaps the richest period for this part of the sub-coastal plain of West Borneo. 37</page><page sequence="4">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 What follows may be read against this brief, initial summary statement for back- ground : (i) double spouts are only known, at present, from nine of the Niah caves in the Subis mountain limestone formation; (ii) to date they have not been located elsewhere despite extensive search in burial caves, some of them undoubtedly late stone-age, in, for example, the Bakong and Baram rivers, 50 or less miles away; И this localization may very well be misleading, and otherwise would be very strange, - but for the moment must be accepted on the available negative data; (iv) such vessels are unknown in historic times ; (v) although no whole double spout or similar vessel in Borneo-made earthenware is known in a historical or ethnological context, related concepts and themes have a continuing value, and themselves originate out of the ancient past, with relevance to the question of why such vessels developed and became so evi- dently important in the Niah Caves (cf. Sections XI-XII later) ; (vi) there is no good evidence that they were "used" in the ordinary or domestic sense; (vii) the vessels are normally polished or burnished with reddish haematite; (viii) they are normally made in two pieces, top and main body. Although conspicuous enough when revealed from a deposit in a nearly complete condition, or with the whole head intact, it remains difficult to determine the exact fre- quency of double-spouted vessels in relation to other types in the total earthenware distribution. The earlier (often larger) examples are nearly always plain, well burnished, like a great many other of the tens of thousands of potsherds recovered in every part of the excavation. The bodies tend to be much fragmented, and can then be confused with parts of other and lesser single-spouted vessels, jars etc. It can be particularly difficult to relate the bodies of vessels to their spouts. In one cave, Jeragan, this was not so difficult, as it is a high, inaccessible cliff cave, almost exclusively devoted to burials over a limited period of time in the late neolithic. A single, perfect, intact specimen, which has told us a deal about the others, comes from Jeragan, with ten others which were comparatively easy to reconstruct. When we turn to reconstruct from the huge West Mouth of the Great Cave, for instance, with so many bits and pieces over long periods of time, the task is formidable. In the Painted Cave, Kain Hitam, a rich but shallow deposit, primarily late stone-age and earlier iron-age, of great intensity and with massive disturbance (partly associated with secondary burial rituals that were performed there) the numerous double spouts are not so difficult to reconstruct in depth, - although scattered all over the place, highly fragmented. In these cave mouths, Jeragan, Kain Hitam and the West Mouth of the 38</page><page sequence="5">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo Great Cave, spouts may be said to be fairly frequent, always in association with burial remains, often (not always) incinerated, charred or otherwise fragmented remains of secondary burials. In the other caves where double spouts have been identified and exam- ined, only one or two examples can be said to be these with certainty. Again, they all seem to be directly associated with burials, though in some of these small caves or grottos the situation is far from clear - largely owing to subsequent disturbance by man and other animals. The following definitely double-spouted pieces have been considered in this review: TABLE I Double-spouted earthenware vessels excavated and studied from Niah Caves (as at i/1972) Number of vessels Cave deposit West Mouth, Great Cave 12 very large and deep Jeragan 11 rather small, deep Kain Hitam I (upper) 16 large but shallow II (lower) 5 smaller Megala 2 medium, shallow Lobang Tulang 1 complex of grottos Gua Samti 1 very small Lobang Kemambang, Sekaloh 1 very small Batu Parang, Sekaloh 1 very small 50 At a conservative estimate those 50 vessels represent hundreds of others not recog- nisable in detail for these particular caves ; perhaps thousands more for the formation as a whole. They indicate, in effect, widespread double spout activity within the immedi- ate vicinity. Evidently, double spouts were common to the whole locality over a con- siderable period. To be more exact, over this considerable period of time some one or more parts of the community were constantly using some sort of double-spouted vessel. III. Broad Prehistoric Cultural Associations The fact that no double-spouted vessel recovered at Niah shows clear signs of domestic "use" is not necessarily proof that such vessels were not used under domestic circumstances elsewhere. But there is no sign that this was so for the examples that were placed, deliberately, in the caves. It would indeed seem a little difficult to use some of the specimens, particularly those in Jeragan and the Great Cave, which have such emphasis on the spout end, a small body with small and in this sense inefficient inflow for filling this body with any form of liquid or other material. 39</page><page sequence="6">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 And although the vessels recovered at Niah have been associated with human skeletal remains rather than with food debris, picnic, shell mound or other deposits, the relationship here need not have always been direct and simple. Thus, one flared-out double spout (only) on the West Mouth of the Great Cave reposed on a rock shelf, closely associated with a separated human skull (Burial 29, see Plate III). Two miles away, high in the cliff at Jeragan, one vessel has been noted as in mint condition, exca- vated out inverted, completely buried in the fine deposit, alongside mixed primary and secondary burials, the whole assemblage purely stone-age here (no later iron or imported stonewares). A mile away again, over in the Painted Cave (Kain Hitam) double spouts are closely associated with the "death-ships" which are a feature there, as also at Samti, on a much smaller scale. These ships may have been used for multiple secondary burials, as ossuaries, where with big feasts the bones of a number of people were placed in one death-ship transported up the cliff for the purpose. The evidence of radio-carbon and of the associated metal, stoneware and glass, indicate that this did not really blossom until well inside the Christian era, some centuries after the main activity in the West Mouth and all activity in Jeragan had closed down (see further at Section X). Although we cannot be certain exactly how the vessels were placed at the time, it is clear that in general they were put with the dead, particularly with relics of the revered dead. They may have been associated with some particular cult of the head or skull also, in the same sort of general cultural setting. The peculiar form of some of the bodies of the vessels may even be taken to represent human heads, crowned by the curious spouting effect which also has anthropomorphic indications. It is not profitable to broaden speculation at this point, but we may return to it with evidence from other and easier ethnological sources at the end of this discussion (Section XII). IV. Basic Characteristics and Style In an important 1959 survey of historic pottery from Borneo, Solheim and his colleagues based their remarks largely on material which has at that time been exca- vated from the West Mouth of the Great Cave at Niah. They subdivided the Great Cave pottery into four main categories: TABLE II First Classification of Niah earthenware (Great Cave only) Type Percentage of total excavated (to 1959 only) Plain 63 Paddle-decorated 29 Polished 5 Painted and incised 3 100 40</page><page sequence="7">Part 2. 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo In considering surface treatment , emphasis was put on the red "slip" found on many polished vessels "associated only with burials". In treating vessel form their study con- cluded (p. 172): "The outstanding form of the polished type is the double-spouted vessels of which there are about half a dozen". Since 1959, eight seasons of intensive and extended excavation have more than quadrupled (see Table I) the number of double spouts available for study, as well as widened their range of variety and cave distribution. These results have also shown that the earlier work was a little premature in suggesting that in caves other than Great Cave the pottery might show "a general deterioration" (p. 167). This is only true in some cave cases and senses. For example, Kain Hitam, the Painted Cave, was only discovered late in 1958, not excavated until 1961-2. It contains an especial wealth of advanced earthenware potteries - and contrary to the belief of the 1959 study, a high proportion of three-colour ware, double spouts, ornamented vessels, etc., considering the relatively small bulk of the deposit (the cave is wide but the deposit shallow). A full report on the Painted Cave is presently being prepared as the third of a series of monographs on West Borneo archae- ology which are being published by the Southeast Asia Program of Cornell University (the previous two are Harrisson and O'Connor, 1969 and 1970;). Some of the "purest" forms of double spouts have been found since 1959 in the Jeragan Cave, not then known, high in its cliff, hidden. The word "deterioration" as used in the 1959 study, must be applied with great caution in discussing techniques of Borneo pottery, as metal technology and imported Chinese stonewares began to im- pinge upon the local craftsmen's mood. We must try and measure these trends by the total output and life of the people themselves rather than by isolating single character- istics in art effects as measured against some outside aesthetic standard for artistic "achievement". Despite these qualifications, nevertheless the early diagnosis remains fundamentally sound. Double-spouted vessels belong to a general tradition highly developed at Niah. Perhaps the most remarkable negative feature of all double-spouted vessels is that none of them have paddle-beater marking anywhere on the body. When there is design, it is nearly always restricted entirely to the top, spouted parts, and usually to a restricted area of that, - as we shall see in following sections. Despite the preponderance of paddle decoration over other forms of surface treatment for the earthenware at Niah (Table II), there is no instance of a paddle-beater having been applied to one of these vessels. 41</page><page sequence="8">Тощ Harrisson JMBRAS, Vol. 44 V. Suggested Typology of Double-spouted Vessels (Niah) Examination not only by the present writer but also by Dr. W.G. Solheim and other ceramic experts, failed to indicate any distinctive differences in the make, clays, materials, tools, techniques within the range of these vessels as a whole. Among the ways in which the group can be approached, clearly the size, general shape of the body is one, form of the spouts another, decoration (if any) a third. Deco- ration, especially, has been very widely used for classifying prehistoric earthenware pottery throughout Southeast Asia. Markings on the exterior of the pots have given rise to a variety of systems, more or less closely related, and largely derived from the tool employed to put on the pattern - such as a paddle-beater, an incising tool, a basket, net or cord. None of these will help us with the double spouts, since many are not decorated at all. As regards size, they have not turned out to be anything like as large as we at first supposed. When we started excavating double spouts, the initial impact was of great strength as well as dynamic. They looked as if they must be associated with big bodies, similar to those with which we were already familiar, such as the 69 cms. high funerary pot, with open mouth, already discussed in the opening section; or the huge, open three-colour ware pots, a fine example of which is on display in the Sarawak Museum from the West Mouth of the Great Cave (Plate I; cf. Solheim, 1959, Plate VI B, and Coloured Plate there). Working from these and other clues, when we first en- countered the double spouts in the Great Cave excavations, 1957 on, we tried to re- construct great vessels from the plain body sherds. Not until well inside 1961, in the high cliff cave at Jeragan, did we find the first whole vessel of this sort, with amazement seeing the body so small in relation to the flaring spouts. That Jeragan vessel (Plate II) came as a surprise. The body height was only 10 inches. In 1964, another from Magala was unusually easy to reconstruct with certainty - and again measured only 11 inches, despite a massive top. This time, we learned that the overall effect could be even "top- heavy", in some cases (T. and B. Harrisson, 1968, Plate 3). As none of the main body sherds (below the spout top section) are surface deco- rated, it was not until we had these new clues in later years of the Niah work, that we were able to proceed with more confidence and with slightly more speed in reconstruct- ing part or all of double-spouted vessels. It became clear, then, that it was never safe to assume the exact shape of the lower body of the vessel from the spouts themselves. With nearly two-thirds of the sherds of earthenware in the total excavation undeco- rated - though not necessarily parts of wholly undecorated pots - the difficulty of attri- buting the correct plain sherds is obvious. When the double-spouted vessel is polished, as is rather often the case, this is a help. But unfortunately, much of the polish or bur- nish wears off after long burial in the deposit, except in the very enclosed and shut-in caves with almost no atmospheric or outside weathering. 42</page><page sequence="9">Plate i.

Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo Of the fifty double-spouted vessels which are the basic study material for the pre- sent discussion (cf. Table I above), half could only be broadly reconstructed. The other half, after more exact reconstruction, provide a basis for reasonable certainty as to the exact shape of the main body, below the spouting. Again, we were surprised to find the variety of forms and their irregularity, as compared with similar experience with other vessels of the same broad categories. This could be due, in part, to the lack of any exactly functional, utility value for the vessels, even as receptacles. If their purpose was to represent some idea or express some feeling, if they were in eifect "symbols" in them- selves, then the emphasis on head and the comparative lack of emphasis on body be- come more readily explicable. Looked at from that point of view, what might then matter to the craftsmen of long ago would have been constructing the body "round" the spouts, to fit into the impressive head, without much regard for anything else. This way, what would not perhaps do for a water-carrying or pouring vessel could ade- quately serve as the body below the essential double spout. The general trend of Niah pottery, as of prehistoric Borneo pottery generally, is towards a rounded body form. There is much less angularity and special shaping of the body here than there is in the Malay Peninsula, for example. Intricacy of form and shape is not, by and large, to the Borneo liking. Double-spouting is, in its own right, an ex- ception, an elaboration at the top which becomes all the more noticeable to the archae- ologist working for weeks and months uncovering and classifying tens of thousands of sherds of all sorts. At this stage, those interested in form should, perhaps, look more closely at the illustrations that accompany this paper, to see what the writer is talking, writing about. There is a tendency, as will be seen, to have either ridge or shoulder running round the pot well below the spouted head. The exact position of this is not regular. On some, it is slight enough barely to reduce the globular effect of the whole. On others it is so pronounced as to make the angle emphatic (e.g. see Figs. 2, 4). On 26 double-spouted vessels, this characteristic of body shape is sufficiently clear to justify definite classification: - 19 are mainly rounded in form; - 7 are pronouncedly angular. Among the double-spouted vessels excavated in a purely neolithic context in the Great Cave and in Jeragan, the proportion of round to angular is less than 2 to 1. At Kain Hitam with the more developed forms associated with metal-age remains, regula- rity becomes scarcer, though never completely absent. A preliminary attempt to classify these double-spouted vessels on the basis of body shape, with particular reference to roundness or angularity, shoulder, center ridge, etc..., gave unsatisfactory results, therefore. 43</page><page sequence="14">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 Similarly, there is a good deal of variety and in a sense inconsistency in the foot of the vessel. This is never separately attached or specially treated, but is handled as part of the continuum of the body downward. No foot is completely rounded, giving a total globularity to the body below the spouts. A few are vaguely convex. In most, the main body either tapers or angles down to a fairly flattened foot, on which the vessel can somewhat precariously be rested. Sometimes there is a slight concavity to the foot. No classification by foot-shape works well. So, in the end the student of these interesting vessels is pushed back on to the double spouts themselves. If, for the time being, we isolate these from the rest of the vessel, assume that in making these there is some special expression of the potter's technique, three rather distinct categories of craftsmanship in completed execution become appa- rent: i. two spouts, nearly always asymmetrical and usually rather markedly angular, rise from a common head which is joined to the body of the pot as a separate piece; sometimes there is a mark like pinching at the base of the neck of the spouted head where it joins the body; the two spouts contain an acute angle between their divide ; ii. two spouts, rounded rather than angular, are each placed directly and separately on the body of the pot, with a domed top ; the two spouts may be bridged or unbridged, - that is with a connecting piece of pottery joining the two spouts together; iii. two more or less rounded spouts, always bridged, are fixed to a flat top which is applied as a complete unit to the body. There is some overlap, particularly between Nos. ii and iii above, as regards detail. But there is a distinction of form here which identifies vessels in more specific ways than any other system of definition. Category i will hereafter be referred to as Type I. Category ii as Type II. Category iii as Type III. Of these three types, II and III overlap most, through the bridging. Al- though it would be possible to put some of the bridged pots of Type II into close asso- ciation with the always, bridged ones of Type III, nevertheless the method of attaching spouts to the body in both the bridged and unbridged examples of II are nearly identical. By contrast, the flat topped pots with spouts of Type III seem to indicate a rather dis- tinct technological innovation. As a whole, Types II and III are more closely related to each other than either of them are to Type I? Yet the transition, particularly from I to II, is not a great one: it would be possible to imagine a single potter making the tran- sition in his own lifetime of potting experience and of that personal experiment which has for so long been part of the Bornean tradition. It would be wrong to think of any of this activity as fossilized and static. The great variety of burial styles, with no two 44</page><page sequence="15">Part 2, 1971.

Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo skeletal treatments identical even within one cave, and with many minor differences from one cave community to another, only underlines this. In view of the bridging overlap, after careful consideration it was decided to sub- divide Type II on the basis of the presence or absence of bridge. A complete typology thus rests at: Type I : with separated unsweeping spouts rising close together from a common head; Type IIA: more rounded spouts, each placed separately on a domed top, with no bridge ; Type IIB: the same as A, but a bridge between the two spouts; Type III: two rounded spouts, bridged, on a flat top. Using this classification, we can now examine the whole excavated material for Niah, cave by cave.

That is, the caves with the purely neolithic or otherwise stone-age deposits are listed at the top, those with no stone-age elements at all are reached at the bottom of the column. This will be discussed again in a moment. Meanwhile, a glance at the table will show a general trend downwards increasingly towards Types IIB and III, away from Type I. This is only a tendency, but it is there. Looked at more broadly, what is really distinc- tive about the Type I vessels is the way the two spouts sweep up from a common base touching or almost touching on their inner sides as they leave the vessel, and sub- tending an angle of less than 100 degrees at that point. These two upsearching spouts are often very closely alike, also. This separation continues into Type IIA, but now there is a significant space between the starting point of the two spouts, as an increasing tendency for them to become dissimilar, in diameter 'one wider and more evenly tubular than the other. In Type IIB, this distinction, separation, is completed and em- phatic. But it is as if the artisan, the potter, felt, in a certain way, that this was going too far, and thus introduced the bridge to bring them back into contact. With Type III, this separation and re-union by bridging becomes completely for- malized, as a set piece on a separate and flat base, plainly attached to the rest of the vessel, instead of the rounded or domed top effects below the spouts in both previous types. These separate flat top units are usually asymmetrical as regards the comparison of the two spouts, but sometimes- and notably the last two specimens on the table - this is not marked ; and the Samti one is conspicuous in that both the spouts are com- pletely rounded and virtually identical (Fig. 12). Indeed, a close examination of the Samti double-spouted top and it's angular, almost industrial effect, leaves some doubt that it has actually been joined on to the main body of any vessel at all. It is if this top was left as a separate spouted disc, in an eventual combination of ritual uses divorced from any pretention at utility effect. Dr. Solheim is only one of several people who has microscopically examined the piece and reached the conclusion that it could have been separately placed in the grotto at Samti, in conjunction with one "death-ship" and a good deal of imported Chinese and Siamese stoneware pottery (see Section X). A heavily haematited piece from Lobang Kemambang, Sekaloh River (surface find, 22.11.65) suggests an ever further development of the Samti style, though it has been impossible to recover enough sherds of this vessel for satisfactory reconstruction. What is distinctive here is that the top of the bridge effect has been pinched up into a nearly pyramidal cone. This cave, on the inland and culturally "poorer" side of the Niah limestone massif, has late ceramic associations, and nothing distinctive before ?I700 ad, so that it is possible this piece was placed, as at Samti, in more recent times. 56</page><page sequence="27">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo Re-examining Table III from this possible developmental point of view, the nine caves detailed there can be grouped, very roughly, into three main time categories. The first two caves have stone-age deposits, on a considerable scale ; the next two, Magala and Parang, are more random and sparse mixed cave associations from elsewhere in the formation, but the double-spouted vessels were found in sectors with a purely stone-age setting there. These four thus make category (a), "early", with a total of 26 double- spouted vessels studied. Kain Hitam at two levels, as Nos. 5 and 6 on the Table III sequence, has the upper cave rich in porcelain-stoneware, glass and metal remains with only a small stone-age element, whereas the lower cave, though much less important in scale, has a stronger early element. Lobang Tulang is a series of cliff grottos on the east side of the Great Cave, which similarly has a neolithic element amongst predominantly early iron-age (and entirely funerary) association (see B. Harrisson, 1958). These three caves make up category (b), with 22 vessels. The last two caves on the Table, Samti and Kemambang, are small burial grottos dating well into the metal period, and on as late as after 1,000 A.D. - though it is always very difficult to fix this terminally at Niah, because of the habit of using mainly old pottery and glass in burials of much later date. These two form category (c), with the two rather special vessels already discussed, and even potentially separable into a Type HIB? Is it possible to group the previous information according to this crude sequence in time, remembering always that there is a much overlap and that no exact comparisons are intended here, least of all quantitatively.

But it also reflects the absence of double spouts in several other purely metallic caves excavated in the complex. In several such, there are no double spouts. Indeed, the single presences at 57</page><page sequence="28">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 Samti and Kemambang, two miles apart, may well be taken as qualitative evidence for the continuation of double-spouted vessels in use - at least in funerary use, though not necessarily manufactured - after the end of the stone-age. This is strongly indicated, al- ready, by the occurrences in Kain Hitam, but is given distinctness by these two addi- tional, isolated records. Further, these two (c) occurrences are both vessels of the only type not found once amongst the 26 double spouts in the purely pre-metal sites of class (a). All three double spout types occur in the intermediately timed class (b), though Type I is the only invariably regular form in all four of the earlier, class (a) caves, - by inference therefore belonging to the pre-metallic, neolithic aspect. The intervening Types II A and II B, commonest in upper Kain Hitam and there closely linked to T'ang and Sung Chinese imported ceramics (from с 8oo A.D.?) bridge again the time-gap, though actually the unbridged rounded spouts (Type IIA) occur at Jeragan in a purely neolithic deposit to indicate their possible ť' 'linkage" to Type I rather more than towards Type III - as already implied on other grounds. VII Bridging Function and Typology A good deal of this discussion tends to come back to the question of "bridging". Half the vessels and nearly all the "later" ones are bridged. This goes with an increased circularity of at least one spout, and in addition a tendency to shorten the height of the spout, as well as cutting out the long upsweep which is such a dynamic feature on some of the Type I pieces. With shorter spouts, the bridge can hardly be seen as having a function to support them; there was no problem with support with the taller and more outsweeping spouts of the Jeragan vessels. It is also striking that the bridge be- comes the center of decoration, as decoration increasingly appears among the vessels (see further in the following section). The bridge could also serve as part of the internal flow system for liquid (or air) in the vessel head (cf. Malleret 1968, figs. 1 and 2). But most of these Niah bridges are solid. A few have weak apertures, and this aspect requires further study with more material. But the basic flow system is expressed in Type I, bridgeless. We cannot, then, assure a strictly functional role for all bridges. On the other hand, the bridge can serve as a useful little handle on the vessels, although sometimes so low that it is awkward for the fingers to carry comfortably in that way. No such handle was found necessary in the Type I vessels, which tend, on average, rather larger than Types II and III. But the importance of the bridges must not be underestimated. In terms of known Borneo pottery art, this was a difficult sort of potting. Indeed, there have been no potters in Borneo in historic times capable of work at this level of intri- cacy. In this sense can the bridges be seen simply as casual developments or stylistic accretion? They must have represented something very positive. And probably some- 58</page><page sequence="29">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo thing then seen to be essential to the object of using double-spouted vessels is the funerary operations at Niah. Once again, one is left, a little unhappily, with few alternatives other than to suggest the bridge - and especially the decorated bridge (see below) - in some way associated with the funerary usage of the vessels themselves. Perhaps it will never be possible to be more definite than this. Little opportunity is likely for recovering more than a few additional, perfect vessels in situ at further excavation anywhere in the Borneo area ; and with the difficulty of open site stone-age excavation in this part of the world, it is equally unlikely that we shall ever be luckily able to know with certainty whether or not similar or identical vessels also had a domestic or any other use away from the caves, in ancient times. Finally, it must be noted that whereas angularity is a rather common incidental feature of the main body of double-spouted vessels, it is infrequent in the bridges themselves. Nearly all are rather elegantly rounded, curving upwards, and continuing in effect the outline of what would be a rounded vessel below. The notable exception, again, is the Type III top from Samti, which is markedly angular. This exception is so conspicuous, in fact, as to add credence to the possible view that the Samti piece is a sort of final evolution of Type III, the beginning of the end of double-spouted vessels and double spouting at Niah - almost meriting a position out at Type IV? VIII. Double-spouted Surface Decoration Decoration is centered on Types IIB and III. With exceptions about to be noted, it does not occur on Types I or IIA. The exceptions for Type I are significant in small- ness, and in the way in which the decoration never occupies a conspicuous part in the pattern of the vessel as a whole. All three types, of course, are completely without patterning of any kind on the main body below the spouted top section. The exceptions with decoration in Type I show it on the narrow band which generally surrounds the neck, below the junction of the two upswept spouts. This neck or ridge may be pinched out or emphasized, in such a way as in itself to give a decorative effect, or at the least an effect of emphasis. Occasionally, this neck has slight impressed pat- terns, as if done with the finger of the potter. And in vessel No. 3 from Jeragan, the well elevated neck is neatly decorated with incised, simple diamond shapes, joined by a double line (see Fig. 3). Finger pinching by the potter, not uncommon on the more elaborate vessels of all sorts at Niah, is also not infrequent among the double-spouted vessels generally. It occurs, inconspicuously, with all types. Another expression is in the single, well reconstructed double-spouted vessel from the Lobang Tulang, with rounded spouts joined by a curved bridge, which is not itself decorated - characteris- tically Type IIB (see Fig. 7). This Tulang pot has quite outstanding knobs on the out- side base of each of the spouts. 59</page><page sequence="30">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 Several Kain Hitam Type III vessels have knobs, up to six and eight around the edge of the separate flat top (cf. below). A rather puzzling single sherd from Kain Hitam has a sharp knob under a row of impressed circle designs ; it has not been possible, yet, to relate this to the spouted section of a vessel. More characteristic, however, is the presence of simple geometrical designs, incised or impressed. It may be possible for the specialist of earthenware pottery to make some classification or distinction between the two methods. But since the use of one technique or the other produces results which are usually very similar, in this particular context not too much importance can be attached to the actual technique of appli- cation. Indeed, it may well be that the same tools were used for both purposes. A bird bone, hollowed at one end and sharpened at the other, could well provide the impressed circles on many of the pots, while if the other end was sharpened this could provide the incised lines. The same could be said of a piece of small bamboo, treated in the same way. Both were certainly tools used for this type of purpose at Niah (Harrisson and Medway, 1962). The designs used on double-spouted vessels at Niah, whether impressed or incised, show narrow variation over the whole range of caves and types involved. But they are sufficiently frequent and insistant to indicate that there was some need for deco- rating in this way, always on the top part of the vessels. Incised or impressed designs comprise only a small fraction of the great number of sherds excavated at Niah over the years - an average of about 3%, often less, in these cave sites; so that this specialisa- tion on double spouts is somewhat conspicuous. The actual patterns of decoration are of three main sorts, intimately inter-related. There are circles, often double circles. There are straight lines, again often doubled or quadrupled, sometimes criss-crossed, more frequently made into triangles (sometimes diamonds). Thirdly, least common, are curved lines, arcs, or other forms where the line is neither straight nor fully circular. Before analysing these simple decorations it may be useful to quote verbatim from the initial decor analysis made by Lynn Patterson (see Section I). In her original summary report, now outdated in some respects but still valid as a lucid approach, she wrote as follows (my italics) : In all pots, the full design is visible only when looking onto the top of the pot. In the flat topped pots, the join of the flat top to the body of the pot serves as a border for the design, and this border is sometimes augmented with molded knobs, spaced evenly around the circle which is the join. The basic decorative elements on the flat tops are incised lines and impressed and/or incised circles. The lines are most commonly arranged in an irregular triangle (or series of triangles), sometimes approaching an isosceles triangle. Each triangle encloses from one to ten or more circles. Other arrangements of the lines: (1) parallelograms to squares enclosing circles: (2) sectors enclosing circles. 60</page><page sequence="31">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo Designs on flat tops are on the whole irregular. Triangles are sometimes stretched, some- times squeezed, seemingly to fill the space. Circles are not evenly spaced within triangles. The bridge decorations make use of the same basic elements: incised lines and incised and/or impressed circles. Ordinarily, designs are centered on the bridge, three inches or less in length and one inch or less in width, running between the spouts in Types IIB and III; or upon the flat top carrying the two spouts in Type III, which go up to eight inches across. This means that with the exceptions noted, any imposed surface design must be con- fined to these last two types, since the other two have no bridge or flat top. It remains striking, however, that in no instance so far examined has there been a trace of deco- ration on the main surface either of the vessel below the spouted top part nor on the spouts themselves. The almost unvarying design pattern on both the bridges and the flat tops below the bridges includes a combination of circle and straight line. In no case do straight lines occur on their own. Occasionally circles occur without lines. Circles may be seen , then, as the basic unit of double spout design in Types IIB and III. Before dis- cussing this further, it will be useful to separate the bridges of Types IIB and III, from the flat tops of Type III only. i) Bridge patterns On the bridges, the most common pattern has two straight lines, single, doubled or quadrupled, intersecting at a centre point with a circle around the point of inter- section, usually not itself shown, lying "invisibly" within the circle. In it's purest form, ' in one direction, there is Kain Hitam No. 15, where median intersecting lines from the corners are augmented by quadruple lines running straight up and down the center line of the bridge, blotted out at the intersection point by the circle ; while on the ter- minal ends (towards the spout at each end of the bridge) there is another set of lines closing in those two parts of the central system to form two triangles. Here, as in every bridge studied, there is no completed surrounding boundary line to form a quadrangle of the whole on the other two sides ; the contours of the bri dge edge form that boundary (Fig. 10). That is to say, where two sides may often be closed to form triangles, the other two are left open. Emphasis on circles rather than lines is well shown in Kain Hitam No. 2, where a lighter arrangement of lines encloses ten circles arranged radiating from the centre, in addition to the central intersection one, where in this instance the lines are shown running across the circle to some extent, unusually. In No. 2, the four angles subtended from the intersection point hold respectively three, two, three and two circles, pairing off in opposite sides (see Fig. 9). Another version, Kain Hitam No. 3, has three double sets of straight lines intercepting the common larger circle, and there are sets of three and five circles with no enclosing lines forming a triangle in any case, and 61</page><page sequence="32">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 the pairing unequal, so that five face three in each case - whereas in the previous exam- ple, No. 2, three face three and two face two. In several examples, such as Kain Hitam No. 2 A, the design at first appears to be incomplete. In this one, only "half" the top pattern has been put on, three paired parallel straight lines running in one direction only, with one circle on one side and two on the other. But at one corner of this bridge, two parallel lines have been started, as if to begin a boundary to a set of triangles on the lateral side ; these run for less than half an inch, and do not connect with anything else. Similarly, Kain Hitam No. 5 has an irregular set of lines, sometimes three double ones in parallel, not closely related to a single large circle and two incomplete half circles - with a thoroughly random effect. However, considering all the circumstances, it is unlikely that such incompleteness is accidental , occurring as it does in each case on an otherwise carefully completed vessel from the original potter's point of view. Completion of extra decoration, at such a level of technology, is a matter of minutes, even seconds in time. Surely, these must have been contrived exercises in visual display, intended to look like they do? This impression is heightened when one passes from the bridges to the flat tops of Type III also (details below). It is as if the potter was sketching or scribbling on the top surfaces. As if, indeed, she or he - more probably she, since in historic times at least all Borneo earthenware has been the work of females only - were putting some sort of message or short-hand on this surface, with the combination of circles and lines. Even with incompleteness, there is a sort of discipline apparent, a routine of relation- ship, not simply a casual thinking and splashing about with a tool to make any sort of pattern that comes into the head. Of the Type III bridges, the commonest, only Kain Hitam No. 13 has no straight lines, instead, four largish circles form a single "line" down the centre of the bridge. These; like most circles, have a double outline, largely or wholly the result of the tool used itself, probably in this case some sort of bone, most likely a bird bone: the wing bones of a hornbill would be particularly suitable, and have been found in the exca- vations. In No. 13, the circles are large, though not the largest. Smaller circles are more numerous, generally occurring in clusters. The larger ones occur singly, as a rule ; and rarely within an enclosed angle or other set of lines - as if there was some deliberate distinction between big circle and small circle presentation (Fig. 11). So far this discussion has centered on Type III bridges from Kain Hitam, where they occur most commonly. Mention has earlier been made of the Lobang Tulang bridge with curious knobs but without surface decoration (Fig. 7). The Samti vessel, already noted for its peculiar angularity and style, has the further distinction of being the most regular, geometrical and in a sense elaborated of all the bridge designs, though it's general decor and style is unmistakably related to the commoner Kain Hitam forms, 62</page><page sequence="33">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo from half a mile away across the gorge. The Samti vessel has five circles inside two sets of double paralleled lines flanking a central intersection of another two sets of double lines, so arranged as to place nine other circles in a separate setting (See Fig. 12). This is distinctly the "tidiest" pattern on any bridge, yet itself not fully symmetrical.... Turning to the rarer decorated bridges in the Type IIB vessels (where the bridge may as well be plain), there is at once a distinction to be made from the geometrical point of view. The straight line is not nearly so apparent. Local emphasis remains, and is extended into the curve or arced line. The important examples are two Type IIB vessels from the West Mouth of the Great Cave. One strong bridge has three large circles, one of them again incomplete; one, as usual, is at the intersection of two long doubled lines, the other two in the subtended angles therefrom. But these lines are not completely straight or even intended to be very straight, but rather faintly curving. This tendency is emphasized in another Great Cave bridge, very strongly made, which shows four large circles, each associated with a pattern of crescentic lines. These cres- cents and arced forms dominate the surface in a way unknown for Type III. The information on Type IIB decoration is not yet sufficient. But in the context of the Great Cave, West Mouth, where there are only tiny fragments of metal and no import ceramics, it is difficult to interpret these two bridges as other than being "earlier" than those numerously associated with imported Chinese stonewares, glass beads and metal remains in Kain Hitam. On the other hand, it cannot be said that these Great Cave bridges are any more especially in the known Borneo tradition, simply because the lines are curving (see Fig. 8). They more clearly belong, as it were, to a parent situation from which the Type III formalization of circles and lines could readily have developed, along with the flat top and two rounded spouts as a separate unit character- izing Type III as a whole. It is neither possible nor desirable to pursue this argument further at the present time ; we must hope for further insight, particularly from related pottery study elsewhere in the area and finds of more vessels, too. ii) Flat-top patterns It is not necessary to repeat for the flat-tops of Type III double-spouted vessels what has already been said for the bridges which equally applies to the tops. In Type III generally, both the bridges and the tops carry decoration of the surface. In addition, several of the Kain Hitam tops have up to eight knobs on the rim joint connecting the flat top to the main body of the vessel - the same sort of knobs as already discussed for the Lobang Tulang vessel of Type IIB, though with varying forms. In some of these Type III vessels a segment of the top, on each side of the spout connections, is decorated leaving an undecorated surface underneath the bridge which joins the spout. It is rare to have a design on the surface directly under the bridge, itself generally decorated. That 63</page><page sequence="34">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 is why, as Miss Patterson early noted, one feels that the full design effect is intended to be seen only when one is looking down on to the top of the pot from above. The join of the flat top to the body of the rest of the vessel serves as a border for the design; and this is where the knobbing comes in also. However the designs of the tops are on the whole more irregular than those on the bridges. The triangles are sometimes stretched and squeezed, as if "to fill the space". Circles are unevenly spaced within the triangles, or other line arrangements - as many as twenty within one enclosure in one instance. Here the curvilinear sweep, as noted in Type IIB above for the bridges, re-occurs round the necessarily circular edge of the flat rim, where it cannot be given quite the same objective "value", since it is the natural way of conforming to the physical shape of this part of the vessel itself. However, there is a distinct reduction in the angularity of design on the tops as compared with the bridges, and several cases where the line is carried irregularly or even into a curve. The lines are also less regularly arranged - though the same general concept and treatment is apparent; there can be little doubt that the metaphor is identical as between tops and bridges (Fig. 9). With the tops, as with the bridges, one is left with the impression of a determined placing of lines and circles, intimately inter-related, with the lines serving as frames or subsidiaries to the circles on which the main emphasis belongs. One is left, also, with the much less clear impression that there is some sort of system or purpose in the ar- rangement, that the individual variation is not just casual but, in a limited sense, "deli- berate" . After looking at a series of these vessels, and handling them for a long time, the viewer is left with an uneasy feeling that there is some language, some alphabet of arrangement spelt out here by an ordinary, honest expression, bafflingly unintelligible these centuries later. We are dealing with something different from the paddle-beater and other set designs which dominate so much of stone-age and later Borneo and South- east Asian earthenware potter/. Here, each free-hand point on each pot is, however narrowly, expressing an individual choice or concept put down in the writing of the bamboo or bone, etched, sketched, impressed or stamped au choix. Rarely, Type III flat-top vessels do not have any design except upon the bridge. The particular case of the Samti vessel has already been adequately underlined. Though rare, this absence, this negative evidence is important. The reverse situation - in which the top is decorated with the bridge plain - is unknown. Always the bridge comes first, design-wise. Where, as in Type IIB, plain bridges do occur, everything is plain as well. Looked at this way, it can be further argued that the bridge itself is an important expression of some concept to do with double spouting. Decorating the bridge is an adjunct (though not an essential) to this concept. Developing and then decorating the flat top below the bridge may then be secondary, subsidiary, by way of aesthetic and intellectual support? 64</page><page sequence="35">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo IX. Decoration in Neolithic and in Historic Times: A Comparative Note Mention has already been made (in connexion with Type IIB bridge designs from the Great Cave) of the relationship between these neolithic patterns and those known in historical and ethnological times on the island of Borneo. In general, it is fair to say that a striking feature of the design on double spouts - striking, anyway, to anyone familiar with living Borneo art in context - is the absence of intricate treatment of line, while nevertheless there remains a certain intricacy of thought in the arrangement of straight line and circle. Patterns on the bridges and tops are not of the sort which would or could be familiar to any Bornean of modern times, even if the thinking be- hind them is not so far distant. Separated straight lines and simple circles, unconnected, seem to be outside the main island tradition in so far as this has survived among the pagan peoples of the interior and even among many of those under strong Islamic influence on the coastal plain. (Around Niah today, there are many hundreds of native people practicing such intricacies in their art forms at this time - though yielding rapidly to new development for purchase, with the advent of a new road from Miri, and much else). Basically, the island peoples of recent generations have been almost obsessed with an interest in continuing, curving, arcing, interlacing lines in inter-connected, intricate patterns. This applies literally wherever patterns are drawn, painted, punctured, threaded, incised, burned, woven, stenciled, cut or carved. The treatment is given on simple utility bamboo containers, woven into basketry, stamped on to body tattoo designs, in depth on sculpture, beadwork and virtually everything else. The result may sometimes be simple, even crude. But it is not simple and crude in any separated, geometrical, yet specific style like that which characterizes the decor of the double-spouted vessels, - and especially those found in the "later" caves (cf. Tables III &amp; IV). It is perhaps relevant that the (probably earlier) Great Cave vessel decorations are less purely geometrical (cf. Section VIII, i, above). It is also relevant to compare double spout decorations with those of the more varied shape range of "three-colour wares" from Niah, indicated in the opening section. These are painted black on red or a red tan base, often with a yellowish green slip of clay of natural colour incorporated as well. Double-spouted vessels are never found in three colours, or in anything approaching that technique, though three colouring is often applied to small and quite elaborate vessels in the later phases, notably at Kain Hitam, as well as more massively on big burial urns in the West Mouth of the Great Cave. Three-colour ware remains to be fully studied. Meanwhile the present writer has handled so much of it in excavation that he ventures to make some distinctions, even though these must remain provisional. Like the double spouts, the three-coloured vessels are almost always decorated with incised or impressed geometrical patterns. But these appear to differ from those on the double-spouted vessel tops, in the following three respects: 65</page><page sequence="36">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 i) there are in effect generally enclosed bands with well defined, incised outlines, enclosing any other form of decor; ii) occasionally as simple as on double spouts, these designs tend, however, to be much more elaborate, less wedded to the circle and angle, frequently following fairly intricate patterns of curvilinear outline, including meanders, scrolls and interlocking arcs (cf. Solheim, 1959, Plate IV), more reminiscent - though not closely so - of the aforementioned historic Borneo styles; iii) whether simple or complex, the decoration comes on to the main body of the vessel, frequently covers a large part of the total surface. The time-scale of three-colour ware remains to be worked out properly. Since the present writer directly supervised the excavation of nearly all the recovered pieces, he can at this stage only suggest that they roughly correspond with the double spouts in time ; that they began a little later ; that they went through a somewhat similar develop- ment of elaboration in detail, probably some reduction in size, and increased ornamenta- tion? The style of the two sorts of pottery, spouted and coloured, different in detailed execution but not fundamentally different, can be well seen in the big show case of Niah Cave neolithic pottery which we put on display in the Sarawak museum from i960 (Plate I). Unlike double spouts, examples of three-colour wares are known from beyond the Niah massif, notably on the tiny islet of Pulau Burong in Brunei Bay (T. and B. Harrisson, 1971 : 123) and with related ware from Gua Sirih, a cave near Kuching, al- most 400 miles to the South (cf. Solheim, 1959, Plate VII). But no exact match is found outside North-West Borneo, as yet. From this point of view, therefore, it seems sound to regard the double-spouted vessels as cousins to the more numerous three-coloured ones, as specialized versions for a particular purpose - which may have contained a built-in limitation on the style and scale of decoration as part of a ritual or other function. At the same time, three-colour wares are equally associated with funerary practices in the caves, particularly with secon- dary burials. No examples have been found away from a cave setting; and no examples into historical times. It is always tempting to theorise different peoples, or waves of migrations, or special cultural impacts, to explain these sorts of differences in pottery or whatever else it may be. But our whole impression from the Niah work does not lead in that direction. Rather, it points towards a high degree of local evolution, beginning well before the neolithic, and closely adjusted to the ecological requirements and particular problems of the area involved. Earthenware pottery is only one expression of a wider activity. It could be very misleading to isolate it, and conclude from bits of it, imperfectly under- stood now, differences we can no longer explain except as due to different people, 66</page><page sequence="37">Part 2, I97ié Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo different cultures, etc. General arguments against this approach are set out in a long paper in press by the writer (T. Harrisson, 1972). For the present, it seems preferable, to suggest that this well-advanced form of pottery, with funerary functions, grew up along several lines with particular strength and duration in the physically and physco- logically rich culture of the protein prosperous Niah complex over two thousand years ago. It began as man there immerged to an increasing technological sophistication in the late stone-age. This neolithic sophistication was undoubtedly connected with out- ward contacts and trade, as well. But it was fundamentally based on an already power- fully established, local, indigenous, native tradition: tradition continued into the radic- ally new technology of metal, notably iron. Iron upset many previous preconceptions and practices. But culturally and artistically it modified, elaborated, added and subtrac- ted, rather than overcame or obliterated. This in the short run at least. In the long run many other factors associated with the rapidly accelerating communication facilities of the iron-age, tended increasingly to reduce purely native, endemic artifacts and pro- ducts where these could be replaced by more durable and more easily made items brought in from outside. This way, for example, there is no doubt that the very large vessels of earthenware, three-colour and other, soon disappeared with the advent of metal technology, which brought also hard, much more durable stoneware urns from China and Siam. These were soon incorporated into burial rituals, along also with brass urns, though the latter remained more difficult to come by and expensive. These imports brought other art forms and motives, fresh decorations and styles. Naturally, the Borneo people reacted most favourably to those which were somewhere near their own way of thinking and of seeing the universe of form. A certain fusion took place, in consequence, in a very complicated way, over centuries of time. Again, the evidence is missing by which we can do anymore than adduce the outlines of this and similar processes. And owing to the destructibility of so many of the materials (especially in open sites away from caves in this climate) it is doubtful whether we shall ever be able to reconstruct completely or at all convincingly the pattern of such trends from the advent of iron into historic times. Ironically enough, we may hope for fuller pictures from the fully neolithic, and before that, when man had much more to do with a protected environment in caves and was more dependant upon them. Later, as his ways of building and shaping the other materials of environment became increasingly complete and satisfactory in the jungle setting, he moved more into the open, where all he left is now lost in jungle roots, termites, damp rot, decay. We do not know, therefore, quite when the intricate, elaborated present design patterns of Borneo evolved into such complexity. Increasing work by art historians, now engaged in research on the subject, may be expected to throw further light. The obvious impact of Hindu and other "Indian" ideas, as well as of the Chinese through 67</page><page sequence="38">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 imported ceramics and more direct intellectual contact, must have had considerable repercussions. But much remains to be explained when we look at the quite distinctive, everywhere recognisable forms in Borneo native art of, say, the last century. To bridge the gap between these, the late neolithic and very early metal (as excavated at Niah) clearly adds to the head-aches. Nevertheless, when all is said and done, decoration of the double-spouted vessels is of high interest, and could eventually also be of considerable value in illuminating such problems, as further evidence becomes available in the future. Evidence, in partic- ular, from the difficult period of about 800 A.D. to approximately 1,600 A.D., when the ethnological record begins to begin. So, it can be said that one is faced here, on the bridges and tops, with a lost tradi- tion, essentially a stone-age tradition which carried on into the metal-age, then slowly faded. As things stand at present, there is no information to override the common sense view that patterns on double spouting, along with double spouting itself, formed an integral part of the Niah intellectual environment. This view may have to be revised (not abandoned) if similar vessels and similar designs are found in relevant context else- where. But until this happens, no other view can be sensibly related to the actual, factual evidence from the ground. This is most markedly so with the double spouts, because we have them in such strength, and over such a considerable time span, at Niah, and nowhere else in the immediate vicinity. To postulate some special trade or separate people bringing them in from outside, in contradiction to the rest of the pottery from another source or route, amounts to special pleading and does not stand up to serious examination when we look at the wider picture. Another definite possibility must be mentioned again: that a special sort of language is written into the decoration of this early Niah pottery. Plenty of precedent exists for this, even into historic Borneo times, with other semi-esoteric forms of signs and sym- bols, ways of conveying information about the living and the dead, some of which can still be interpreted, others not (see Harrisson and Sandin, 1966). In that case, the arrangement of various lines and circles contain coded information on burial status, as with markers in Sabah caves (B. Harrisson, 1966). If the study of decoration, in some detail, takes us into some difficult byways, we must not refuse to face the difficulties for that reason. There is no other way we can ever get behind these problems except through an orderly exact examination of archae- ological information. It is more pronouncedly so in a country like Sarawak, where there is no written native history and none at all pre-European. The gap between the past and the present is so great, frequently, that attempts to explain the present can be grossly misleading without that essential information from the past. Therefore, we must make the best of what we have, even if it is not good enough for anything approaching per- 68</page><page sequence="39">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo fection. Having, then, done the best we can with the design, let us return now in the concluding sections of this analysis, to the vessels as a whole, with particular reference to available information on evolution in time. There is a good deal of information about this aspect for Niah, owing to the considerable number of radio-carbon (C-14) dates obtained from the excavations at many of the caves in the formation there. X. Problems of Age and Supposed Sequence for Double-spouted Vessels Urn burials in the West Mouth of the Great Cave, with double spouts, have been dated between 1,330 and 1,120 b.c. and perhaps earlier (see Section I above). More detailed laboratory work on the West Mouth burials is now in hand, and a series of new carbon dates are expected which may enable us to trace the considerable span of double spouts there, including Types I, IIA and IIB. Nothing to hand so far from this Great Cave mouth, the richest of all, gives any indication of activity inside the Christian era (that is, A.D.). Some late available dates for the West Mouth are: c. 500 b.c. for multiple burial ossuary (cf. В. Harrisson, 1967: 166); с. 745 b.c. for a late neolithic extended primary burial; c. 750 b.c. for the sub-surface "ash seal" at edge of deposit; 1330-1120 b.c. for contents of big earthenware urn (above). The other main source of fully stone-age double-spouted vessels, the Jeragan cave, with Types I and IIA, provided two particularly significant dates which relate to the perfectly intact, complete vessel excavated there: JERAGAN, coffin burial 4,3001^160 years (1965) =c. 2,250 b.c. (primary) JERAGAN, jar burial 3,070^410 years (1965)- c. 1,120 b.c. (secondary) This particular double spout association is almost certainly closer to the second, later date, rather than the first: that is, roughly at around 3,000 years ago. And, as we have already seen, double spouts go particularly with secondary burials, the more re- fined treatment of the deceased. These Jeragan indications are supported by another date from the less simple con- text of Magala Cave with a Type I vessel where the C-14 sample in question is from human bone of a possibly associated burial: MAGALA 3,130^240 years (1965) =c. 1,180 b.c. It is clear, then, at least Type I and almost certainly many of Type II, go back some 2,500 years or more in the Niah context. But none of the Type III, flat top vessels with double spouts, have been found in any setting with comparably early dates. They belong rather to the "Christian era" sequence, which is well documented at Kain Hitam. There, in the Painted Cave, double spouts are closely associated with wooden' death- 69</page><page sequence="40">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 ships, a series of which have been dated. From the much smaller grotto at Samti, with it's single, triangular, conspicuous double-spouted top, there is also a date from a wooden death-ship. These death-ship dates are complicated by the fact that if an old tree is used, the date will be older, accordingly; fairly old trees had to be used for size. Therefore, the given date is likely to be the earliest possible in such cases. It may be well to deduct two centuries, or even more, to get the precise times when the coffin was actually made from the tree trunk. For what they're worth, then, here are the four early death-ship dates: TABLE V KAIN HITAM &amp; GUA SAMTI C-14 dates of four wooden "death-ships" used in secondary burials and probably associated more with Type III double-spouted vessels Cave Mean age of sample (years) Approx. date A.D. or B.c. Kain Hitam 2,300 c. 350 b.c. Gua Samti 2,115 c. 150 b.c. t Kain Hitam 1,180 с. 780 A.D. Kain Hitam 1,045 с. 915 A.D. Note: t The Samti death-ship does not necessarily reflect that particular double spout as regards date; this is a grotto used as a sort of burial dump over years, and including some Siamese stonewares not earlier than 1,300 a.d. Even without allowing for the margin of error with dating old wood, the four death-ship dates in Table V fall outside the range of the Type I dates earlier enume- rated. There is fairly strong evidence to suggest that Type III really is later in time, though the position of Type II, unbridged and bridged, remains rather complicated. Nor is it necessary to make one simple, single evolution for any such item in the Borneo setting ! Material developments were usually much more complicated than that ! Of particular interest is the survival of a death-ship cult after the advent of iron and well into the high growth of the Chinese import trade in ceramics, which reached a crescendo in the Sung dynasty (960-1278 A.D.). It is likely with the great increase of hard and fine stonewares brought in during that dynasty, the more elaborate locally manufactured soft earthenware did gradually perish. But it seems clear that they sur- vived, in Type III form for the double spouts (and in some beautifully made small vessels of three-colour ware also) well after the advent of the Chinese ceramic impact, which really began late in the T'ang (620-906 A.D.). Summing up the date evidence: it looks as if double spouts began in earnest at Niah after 2,000 b.c.; they did not, in any case, become strong, numerous and impor- 70</page><page sequence="41">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo tant until well after that date, and probably not until around or about 1,000 b.c. They continued, in varying form, until about 1,000 A.D. and perhaps later than that, but not in any great strength, though of course specimens might well have survived for a long time as heirlooms or in other use as manufactures of centuries before. Thus, double-spouted vessels span some two millenia. This is a long continuity in terms of any sort of specialized, let alone apparently localized, craftsmanship: nearly 100 generations of potters ! Under such circumstances, what is surprising is not the variation or evolution of the double-spouted vessels, as such, but rather the consistency and the evident sense of purpose that prevailed during this long period in prehistoric thinking. Such pot-forms must have met a lasting Niah need. XI. The Persistent Prehistoric Function of Double-spouted Vessels In one burial in the West Mouth of the Great Cave, a double spout was found placed directly beside a human skull (Plate III), one of the repeated associations with secondary burial. The basic funerary relationship for all types is beyond dispute - even though, as already noted, this does not mean that the double spouts cannot have been used in other ways, outside the caves. My own belief is that the idea of the double spout is connected to the idea of the journey of the dead from this world into another world; and that passage through the body of the pot, or latterly through or over the bridge between the two spouts, could have been a symbolic passage of the spirit of the dead, locking through the skull. To some extent, also, the double spout may have represented the concept of the head itself. If there is anything in this thinking, it may link especially to the hornbill's beak and casque, perhaps the most persistant and prevailing head sym- bol in Borneo, as well as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. A piece of a hornbill casque was actually excavated in the West Mouth in 1965 (Trench Ell). Other pieces have been found in the Gan Kira mouth in a purely stone-age association. To indicate the scope and scale of this thinking, out of the cave half-light of long ago into the living present, I draw attention to a hornbill casque used as a tobacco box by some Kenyahs from Long Nawang, who gave it to me a few years ago (Plate IV). It suggests the 4 'negative" half of the Samti stirrup-like top. Much the same idea is often expressed in bead and mat work carrying human heads spouting hornbill casques, from either side, as in a Kayan bead mat from the upper Rejang river in interior Sarawak, (Plate V). Here the beaks have become "ears". But the whole pattern is reminiscent of the double-spouting, especially in the Type I manner. I have discussed this "hornbill obsession" and the human head, especially as growing out of the skull, in a study of an early metal-age object from the interior of Sarawak, in bronze, (. Artibus Asiae , 1964, with 10 plates). 71</page><page sequence="42">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 There is, of course, the further strong possibility that double spouts were used for special classes of burials or related funerary rites, quite apart from any status variation in the actual design or decoration of the vessel itself from that point of view. Once more, one must refrain from excessive speculation, only hope that further data can be accumulated before it is too late. But it is not possible to set these double-spouted vessels aside as merely other, ordi- nary forms of pottery, casual variations on the potter's art. Moreover, fine double- spouted vessels, of Types I and IIA, injeragan particularly, are more noticeable because the rest of the burial furniture in this crowded clifF cave is relatively crude and poor. Jeragan has very few, very simple pieces of jewelry, a single polished quadrangular stone adze, no three-colour ware and little other special pottery at all. Even allowing for the important distinction between perishable and inperishable things, this seems a low standard of dying on any Borneo account. Jeragan probably was a poor man's cave, as compared (say) with West Mouth of the Great Cave. Yet the method and even the exact lay-out of burials is so similar between the two, as to leave no doubt a common culture and a common people are buried in both places. Despite comparitive poverty in Jeragan, the double-spouted vessels were so important, if not actually essential to certain sorts of burial, that they are strongly present, and within their types as "good" as those in the richer West Mouth of the Great Cave. XII. Wider Relationships? Inevitably, students of double spouts, finding them in this extended, two to three millennium isolation at Niah, must turn with a faint feeling of uneasiness, to search for some point of origin. It is going rather far to suggest that the whole thing simply began in the Niah caves. On the other hand, each thing has to begin somewhere. There has been far too much said on the part of the Western scholars especially, to belittle the potential for creation among local populations in this part of the world, to attribute everything fine or good necessarily to some "outside influence". This can be, has been, misleading. There is enormous capacity for internal creation and artistic exploitation within the communities of island Southeast Asia. Although that capacity has been to some extent blunted and obscured during the centuries of European occupation, it is time, in this field, for a fundamental revaluation. It is equally tiresome, on the other hand, to develop a parochial or local insistence, the kind of excess pride that attributes everything to internal effort. Niah belonged to one great pattern of human achievement in the tropical jungled world. And there are, of course, parallels, even to double spouting, in adjacent lands. But double spouts are so few and far between, that the great French orientalist, Louis Malleret, has lately pub- lished a far-reaching paper on the evolution of such vessels, based on a single bronze 72</page><page sequence="43">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo double spout found by chance in the ground in central Vietnam in 1963, with no sort of archaeological attribution. (This important paper will be discussed further below and quoted at XIII, 18, also). I have not attempted, for this study, to carry the subject of double spouts around the world. Perhaps an opportunity will come to do this in the near future. It will be well worth doing. But working recently in Belgian and Dutch museums, in quite an- other connexion, several not too distantly related vessels have been identified. The nearest relation, at least superficially, is a not so uncommon sort of double- spouted vessel, apparently made in the south of Sumatra into historic times. One of these, examined in the Leiden museum, also attracted the attention of Doctor Malleret, who illustrates it (1968, Plate III). This Sumatran type is nearest to Niah IIB, though the body is entirely different, in a more thoroughly "Malay" tradition of potting, un- like anything from Niah. One of the spouts is well rounded, and (as may be the case at Niah) probably intended for inserting the liquid. The other spout has a small hole, for pouring; and, very interestingly, has been finger "pinched" in the fresh clay, in the same way as earlier noted for some of the Niah double spouts. Similar vessels are known from elsewhere in Java and islands of Indonesia. But so far as I know, none have been found in an archaeological setting, and no great age has been attributed to them? Further study is needed, however. Moving to the mainland, it is necessary to mention the traditional kendi , with both Indian and Chinese associations of origin, a familiar vessel throughout the area. Though in a way the kendi has two "spouts", in fact one is always the top , is simply a funnel into which the liquid is poured, to be projected out of the other aperture, which is narrower and pointing to the side. The Niah Type II and Type III vessels could have been operated in this way, although the spouts are more equal in size and position, approximately. But the kendi bears no relation at all to Type I. Nor is it ever bridged. North, then, to Malleret' s bronze vessel, which has two equal spouts, but sticking out of the side , with an additional large open central funnel as third aperture overhead. Dr. Malleret considers on various grounds that this is probably of Cham origin, but admits the difficulty of giving even an approximate date. Proceeding from this unique Vietnamese specimen, he draws parallels with the Indonesian vessels already mentioned above, but more particularly with others from Peru of pre-Columbian times. The slightest examination of Peruvian and particularly Inca vessels, for instance the fine collection in the Leiden Museum or again in Brussels, does not fail to impress the observer with the superficial similarity as between the bridged double spouts on some of these and on some of the bridged vessels from Kain Hitam specially, though they have no third hole like Mallereťs pot. If we only knew of the Kain Hitam vessels, as might well be the case through hazard fortunes of single cave excavation, it could be 73</page><page sequence="44">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 considerably easier to follow Dr. Malleret in his suggestion that this type of vessel, and specifically his solitary Vietnamese one, implies some trans-Pacific origin (Malleret, 1968: 60; cf. XIII. 18 below). An eye comparison (Т.Н. 1972) in particular with the important series collected by the late King and Queen of the Belgians from the Nasças culture of Peru suggests the parallels, even with Type IIB, are tenuous indeed. For instance, the uniformly tubular spouts from Nascas are always symmetrically bridged, but all the domed top part is plain, whereas the main body is very fully and vigorously decorated. None of these and other Peruvian double spouts ressemble the Niah Type I (cf. della Santa, 1962). In view of the Niah material, it must be emphasized that the sort of double spout compared from Vietnam can as well be related to the kendi as to the double spout in the strict sense of the Peruvian vessels (which date from around 1,500 b.c. or right in the Great Cave period; and onward). It must also be emphasized that, since we do have information from a series of caves at Niah, the Inca and Nascas bridged vessels cannot be considered in isolation, but against the background of the Type I Niah vessel. It would be idle to attribute trans-Pacific impact only to the Type II or III vessels. And if we are going to apply this to the Type I vessels, we shall have to go back further in time than any-one would at present be prepared to assume, let alone accept, for such a scale of cultural movement of craft objects across that or any ocean? This necessarily brief discussion is not intended to dismiss or to simplify the high scholarship of others. On the contrary, Mallereťs paper is both suggestive and stimu- lating. He did not have the advantage of knowing that double-spouted vessels of any sort occurred in Borneo and in numbers in an archaeological setting. And his approach has been handicapped through lack of time-sequence data from the Asian side of the Pacific. But, without being wholly ridiculous, in fairness it must be recognized that this sort of argument could be stretched almost equally to suggest that double spouting spread from Borneo northward and for eastward. Much more research is required in this field. Double-spouted vessels, distinctive and easily identified, provide an excellent net of clues for one line of investigation. So, in fact, do the other types of pottery mentioned in the opening section of this paper such as the turtle- ware, the "phallic tops" and the three-colour ware, all of which are distinctive in appearance. The importance of these pottery artifacts lies in their survival and persistance in archaeological and other human environments, where - in the tropics at least - so many other important things perish or disintegrate. We have so few markers to use right across the Asian and Pacific world. In conclusion, therefore, further study of double-spouted and all related material is strongly urged for the future. This first contribution has many defects. It may be forgiven as a serious attempt to push thinking forward in these diffuse directions. 74</page><page sequence="45">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo XIII. Summary of Conclusions 1) The double-spouted vessels, as here described, are made of earthenware pottery with two separate projections standing out from the top - sometimes so much so as to make the whole vessel top heavy. Each spout is bored - not necessarily symmetrically and sometimes very unevenly - with a hole to take in or let out fluid, air, "spirits", etc. There is no separate central larger hole or funnel for 4 Tilling" the vessel easily. The top is normally made as a separate unit from the main body, which is usually burnished (with haemitite, etc.) and/or polished. 2) Such or similar vessels are not at present known in a historical or ethnological setting in Borneo, but only from the writer's excavations since 1957 at the Niah caves, in north-West Sarawak. 3) These are thus the most topographically restricted and physically specialized pots of their kind, although broadly "related" to other striking forms in the rich Niah neolithic complex, including three-colour ware, "phallic tops" on boxes, and turtle- ware, all of which occur prehistorically at Niah but have been identified over a wider area - minimally a three-four hundred mile radius. 4) All these make up only a small part of the total pot complex at Niah, in which most of the vessels have more familiar forms, largely completed with paddle-beater (Table II). 5) The double-spouted vessels occur in at least nine different caves in the limestone massif within a two mile radius of the Great Cave at Niah. 6) Fifty vessels have been studied for this analysis. Of these, half have been more or less satisfactorily reconstructed to get the whole body shape from sherds, the rest are complete as regards the spout and top section only; one double-spouted vessel, from a purely neolithic burial cave, was recovered intact (Table I). 7) Double-spouted vessels are almost invariably associated, at Niah, with burials, especially "secondary burials". This does not exclude the possibility that they had other uses away from the caves in the past, but there is no evidence of this at present. 8) After discussion, the vessels are divided into three main types, with one sub- type. Body form, decoration and other criteria do not provide a clear basis for classi- fication, as is fully described in Section V. The most satisfactory basis is the treatment of the spouts themselves: Type I asymmetrical, tapered, upswept spouts rising from a common point, subtending an angle; Type IIA spouts rounded rather than angular, each rising directly and separately from the domed top; Type IIB as A, but bridged between the spouts; Type III two rounded and bridged spouts attached to a flat top. 75</page><page sequence="46">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 44 9) Type I vessels only occur in caves which are either wholly or partly with late stone-age content (c. 500 b.c. or earlier). Type III vessels only in caves which are wholly or partly with metal-age content. Type II are more diffusely distributed, but incline in the direction of Type I - to wards the stone rather than metal phases (Tables III and IV). Two Type III vessels may date after 1000 A.D. and possibly deserve further separation on stylistic ground. These and other variations in the vessel forms are discussed in some detail in the text. 10) Bridging is also discussed in some detail. It is important. It appears to have become so with decorative or symbolic function, over and above any possible utility value. 1 1) Similarly, decoration on the vessels is almost invariably either incised or im- pressed with simple tool upon the bridge (especially) and/or on the flat top immediately below it (in the case of Type III). Finger pinching or small knobs occur, too. It is sug- gested that the visual results may be supposed to be looked at mainly from above. 12) The decoration, absent in Type I except for minor patterning on the rim be- low the spout in a few cases, is always geometrical and simple. Straight lines and circles are the essential symbols, with particular emphasis on the latter. Circles sometimes occur alone. The arrangement and significance of these designs is discussed (Sections VIII-IX). 13) Designs, which never occur on the main body of the pot, are believe to have some ritual and perhaps spiritual significance. 14) Double-spouted vessel designs do not conform to the general, presently known standard of Borneo traditional art in historical times (Section IX), though some deco- rated bridges of Type IIB from the Great Cave are a little more in that direction. A special language of symbolism may have developed with the double-spouted vessels, for some specific purpose, now unknown. But when these vessels died out, with the increasing impact of imported ceramics and metal technology, that "language" was lost. 15) The "double-spouted idea" clearly belongs to persistent, significant aspects of local life and death. It is unlikely that these are purely endemic or local. On the other hand, the growth of this potting was evidently highly developed in local terms. 16) As there are no parallels to these vessels from elsewhere in Borneo (so far) and no close ones from elsewhere in the immediate vicinity, it is impracticable to point to any major outside influences, particularly for the probably "earliest" forms, ТуреЛ. 17) There are however some interesting parallels with apparently later pots from Sumatra. There may well be a common ancestor somewhere along the line, at present lost. Caution is urged in too readily explaining the presence of such striking vessels as necessarily due to outside impact in any direct form. Mallereťs recent summarizing of trans-Pacific influêíice to explain a single double-spöuted (but also funnelled) bronze 76</page><page sequence="47">Part 2, 1971. Prehistoric Vessels Excavated from Niah Caves, Borneo vessel from Vietnam is discussed in connection with suggested Peruvian relationships. (Section XII). 18) In view of the new Niah evidence, the present writer is therefore forced to question Mallereťs suggestion: "The presence of the double spout in Central Vietnam where it is represented, we believe, by only this one example, is highly abnormal. Should one think that at a certain period in history exchanges were established by maritime routes in this part of the world and that the prototype of the double spout would (thus) be an American importation ?" (translated from Louis Malleret, 1968: 60) Before 1957, not even one example of double spout was known from Borneo. What erroneous deductions could have been made there in 1956? Or, for that matter, now! 19) These vessels as a class are so distinctive, their tops so readily identified in any excavation or museum collection, that further study of them is urged as likely to be a particular value in tracing up trends, developments and movements in Borneo, South- east Asia. Meanwhile, the present paper must be taken as purely tentative and more widely preliminary. XIV.

APPENDIX; The large class of single-spouted vessels of local earthenware which closely overlap to the im- ported Chinese stoneware kendi, raise other problems, which I hope to discuss in a later paper. These are particularly numerous in Kain Hitam, the "Painted Cave" at Niah, on which a separate mono- graph is now under (gradual) preparation. They are also frequent in the Sarawak River delta sites, and especially at the earliest of these, Tangong Kubor, as discussed in detail by W.G. Solheim, "The Prehistoric Earthenware of Tanjong Kubor", Sarawak Museum Journal , 12, 1965 : 1-70 and more generally in T. Harrisson and S.J. O'Connor, Excavations of Prehistoric Iron Working in West Borneo , Cornell University (Southeast Asia Program), 1969, Volume 2. A new classification of kendi is by Mrs. Eine Moore in Sarawak Museum Journal , 18, 1970: 1-78, especially at pp 14-16 and 39-41, with Text and Plate illustrations; this important paper also discusses the related spouted ewers , usually with ear-lugs or handles - never found on true kendi, nor on double-spouted vessels as so far known.
