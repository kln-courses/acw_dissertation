Critical reflections on state personhood JACOB SCHIFF* Abstract. In a 2004 forum, Alexander Wendt, Patrick Jackson, Colin Wight and Iver Neumann asked two questions about state personhood: Are states real, or merely as-if? Are they people? I question the terms of their debate, which relies upon a problematic distinction between 'real' and 'as if. Drawing largely upon Foucault, I challenge that distinction. This challenge has important theoretical and normative implications. Theoretically, a discourse of state personhood is completely unnecessary to understand world politics. Normatively, by tightly linking personhood and responsibility, some of the authors obscure important dimensions of responsibility to and respect for the non-human world. Introduction As Alexander Wendt notes, IR theorists, policymakers, members of the media, and ordinary citizens often make important assumptions about the kinds of entities that states are. In particular, many assume that states are rational in their pursuit of diverse and shifting interests; that they have identities which can be stable but that can also change; that they have malleable beliefs, desires, fears, and so on.1 In a 1959 article, Arnold Wolfers called for the 'empirical analysis' and clearer theorisation of the importance of the state as an 'actor' in world politics, which is one form that such an analysis might take.2 Since then, a number of IR theorists have questioned the status of many assumptions that scholars frequently make about states.3 The voluminous body of work on such issues has not, however, settled the matter. A different set of questions about these assumptions motivate the contributors to a recent symposium published in the Review of International Studies: Alexander Wendt, * This article was presented as a paper at the International Studies Association Annual Meeting, Honolulu, 2005. I would like to thank Alexander Wendt, Patrick Jackson, David Newstone, and Rafi Youatt for helpful comments on previous drafts.

Their questions, it seems to me, are these: Are postulates about the kinds of entities that states are just that- postulates - or do they refer to something real? Are these assumptions merely useful fictions, as they are for writers like Robert Gilpin, who claims at the end of the day that 'the state does not really exist'?4 Or does the state really exist? And if it does exist, what is it? Is it an actor? Is it a person? Does it matter? How does it matter? Some of the contributors explicitly treat questions about actorhood and questions about personhood as interchangeable. For instance, in his introductory essay Jackson moves without comment from Wolfers' conception of the state as an actor to 'the question about what we might call the person-hood of the state', as though these are obviously one and the same.5 Wendt is more self-conscious about this: he is explicit about the fact that he takes 'actor' and 'person' to be synonymous, since the attributes routinely applied in IR to state actors are those of persons.6 I think that this move decides much at the outset that need not be so decided. In fact, the decision itself may be problematic inasmuch as it may constrain both theoretical analysis and normative theorising in world politics, in ways that I will explore below. In any case, the symposium is a wonderful forum in which to explore this set of questions, and the answers reveal a diversity of views. Wendt leads the pack with his strong claim, on scientific realist grounds, that states are not just 'as if persons, but 'real' ones.7 Wight agrees with Wendt that states are real, but denies that they are people.8 Jackson agrees with Wendt that states are real, and that they are people, but he vigorously rejects the scientific realist premises upon which Wendt makes his argument.9 Finally, Neumann is more difficult to pin down, but he appears to deny that the state is real -on the grounds that language is metaphorical, and so the question is not whether states are real or metaphorical, but rather what metaphors constitute it - and he also denies the usefulness of arguing that states are people inasmuch as such arguments 'seem to constrain rather than to enable our inquiry into what is happening to states and their place in global politics here and now.'10 However, the latter claim seems to reflect agnosticism about state personhood - which I share - rather than a denial of it, since Neumann's objections to Wendt's argument seem to focus on the latter's putative latent Durkheimianism. If one were to argue that states were people in a non-Durkheimian way - whatever form such an argument might take - Neumann's objections on this score might be met. The four very different pieces in this symposium may well collectively represent a significant milestone insofar as they open up a debate that bears directly upon both IR theory and upon the way we think about and live among states. What comes of this debate remains to be seen. However, given its potential significance, it seems especially important that things get off on the right foot, and I'm not sure that the 4 Robert Gilpin, 'The Richness of the Tradition of Political Realism', in Robert Keohane (ed.), Neorealism and its Critics (New York: Columbia University Press), d. 318. 5 Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, 'Forum Introduction: Is the State a Person?

My purpose here is not a wholesale critique of the forum or its authors. Not all of the authors are guilty of all of the argumentative moves that I criticise. Accordingly, my focus shifts at different points from some authors to others, and on occasion I turn to the authors themselves to help me make my case. My unease with the terms of the debate stems initially from a move that several of the authors make either implicitly or explicitly: they seem anxious to draw a line between states being 'real' or merely 'as-if (although Neumann is less clearly guilty of this, and provides a helpful, alternative formulation). This could be a question of instrumentalism: Is an assumption about the reality of the state theoretically useful? But, Wendt, at least, rejects the instrumentalist view, trying to claim instead that the state has 'ontological standing in its own right'.11 In this article, I suggest that we step back for a moment, because the very question of whether states are 'real' or 'as-if is itself a symptom of a deeper problem that Wendt shares with several of the symposium's authors. The question rests upon a problematic emphasis on a particular understanding of the 'real' (as referring to some underlying ontological reality) and a corresponding misunderstanding of discourse as consisting of various forms of 'mere' talk. If, on the other hand, the 'real' is understood as the world to which we do or can have access of some kind, and if discourse is properly understood not as mere talk about an independently existing reality, but as talk and practices that produce the very reality to which they refer, then the distinction between 'real' and 'as if that I just described breaks down. This has at least two important consequences for the debate about state personhood. First, it suggests that one need not understand states as people per se in order to make sense of what goes on in international life. Second, it recasts the normative import of the state-as-person question by under- mining its implicit presumption that there is something intrinsic about human beings that makes them uniquely deserving of moral, ethical, and political consideration.12 The article proceeds as follows: In the first section I show how each author relies to varying degrees on a problematic distinction between 'real' and 'as-if. In the second section, I draw upon the work of Michel Foucault to show how this distinction rests on a misunderstanding of discourse as mere talk about the world, rather than as something that constitutes it in meaningful ways. In the final section, I draw out some normative and theoretical implications of this argument for the state-as-person debate. 11 Wight makes the suggestion about instrumentalism (in 'State Agency'), and Wendt later refers to it ('State as Person', p. 290). In that reference, however, Wendt positions his own, scientific realist position against instrumentalism in order to claim that the state has 'ontological standing in its own right'. 12 Thus I agree with the spirit of Peter Lomas' response to Wendt in which he indicates that there is something ethically suspect at work in the argument for state personhood, even if I think this critique needs to be much more radical. Wendt's reply quite explicitly does not address these issues, which he takes to be in some sense secondary.

In all three cases, the 'as-if /'real' distinction is figured as a distinction between the way we talk or think about the world - between what Wendt seems to mean by 'discourse'13 and the way the world is. Wendt makes this distinction most explicitly; indeed, it appears to be the driving force of his argument for thinking about states as people. He notes at the outset that '[d]espite our state-centric world ... if pressed on whether state persons are "real", in my experience most IR scholars will back away. States are not really persons, only "as if ones.'14 This position is Wendt's primary foil. Against it, he builds on an earlier argument15 in order to claim that 'state persons are real in at least one important sense: they are 'intentional' or purposive actors.'16 It is not just that we talk about states as */ they are real persons - states are real persons. Thus, Wendt seems to draw a very hard line between the 'real' and the 'as-if. Because he renders the distinction between 'real' and 'as-if so starkly, Wendt is the easy and obvious foil for my own argument that this distinction is problematic. But Jackson and Wight also rely on similar kinds of distinction. The main thrust of Jackson's critique of Wendt seems to be that the latter gives ontological priority to things over relations and processes - that he is a 'substantialist' about the constitu- tion of state persons rather than a 'relationalist',17 because he focuses on the constitutive properties of state personhood rather than on processes of 'persona- tion'.18 The problem with being a substantialist, according to Jackson, is that it involves abstracting away from ongoing processes - those of maintaining a house, say, or maintaining the master-slave relationship, or maintaining a state - taking a 'snapshot' of those processes, and treating that one moment as the constitutive essence of the phenomenon (house, master/slave, or state) that we call 'house', or 'state', or whatever.19 Jackson contends, however, that such 'statements are also integrally wrapped up with the production and reproduction of the entities to which they only apparently refer: this is a house [or a state] only because we act as if it were and consequently make it so.'20 This makes it sound as though Jackson is eliding 'real' and 'as if, but his analysis is reductive in a way that suggests otherwise. The real problem for Jackson is the reification (the making-real) involved in constitutive theorising - 'the analyst reifies a series of ongoing processes, treating something that is actually fluid and dynamic as if it were static and fixed.'21 Jackson's assertion that entities are really processes seems to cut against his otherwise useful observation that 'knowledge and reality are not two separate things', insofar as he implicitly maintains the distinction between 'real' and 'as if.22 It also seems to betray the 13 Wendt, 'State as Person', p. 289. 14 Ibid., p. 289. 15 Alexander Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 215-24. 16 Wendt, 'State as Person', p. 291. 17 Patrick Thaddeus Jackson and Daniel H.

Wight argues that '[i]f theoretical posits are not attempts to refer to real entities the theorist has no obligation to give account of them'.24 Here Wight makes reference to two clearly different registers. On one hand, there are 'real entities' that exist, presumably, out there in the world. On the other hand, there are 'theoretical posits' that theorists use in order to talk about, to make reference to, those real entities. By making an account of theoretical posits a matter of an 'obligation' which a theorist may choose to fulfil or not, Wight clearly upholds implicitly a distinction between an underlying reality - those 'real entities' - and an as-if representation of that reality in the form of 'theoretical posits'. Moreover, that distinction is clearly hierarchical: 'real entities' take pride of place over 'theoretical posits'; the 'real' is ultimately more important than the 'as-if. Neumann's position is much more subtle. He seems, at first, to maintain the 'real'/'as-if distinction as do the other authors. He notes at the outset of his remarks that '[m]ost narrativists would indeed disagree with [Wendt's claims that states are real and that they are people], and underline that states are like persons . . . that Wendt is availing himself of an analogy, a comparison, a metaphor'.25 This 'like' functions in the same way as does 'as-if, and it suggests that, for 'most narrativists', there remains a fairly hard distinction between reality and metaphorical or analogical representations of that reality. But Neumann's voice is conspicuously absent from this rendering of the 'narrativist' position. And he later insists, in his own voice this time, that: If one believes, as I do, that thinking depends on the language in which it is couched, and that language cannot help but be metaphorical, then the key question is not whether a certain phenomenon is metaphorical or not, but which metaphors constitute it, with what effects and at what alternative costs (in terms of the relative merits of using other and competing metaphors).26 Neumann hints here, provocatively, at a different relationship between language, or discourse, and the world. Whereas for Wendt, Jackson, and Wight discourse seems to be talk about an independently existing reality, Neumann insists instead that the relationship between discourse and the world is constitutive. For the state-as-person debate, the interesting question thus becomes: By what metaphors do we constitute the state? And how do these metaphors enable or constrain our thinking?27 1 address these questions in the third section. In the next, I want to explore the constitutive function of discourse a little further, and from a perspective different from that of Neumann. 23 Jackson and Nexon, 'Relations Before States', and Burke C.

In this section, I claim that it stems from a shared misunderstanding of the nature of discourse. I should insist right here - by way of pre-emption - against a particular interpretation of my claim, which I have yet to advance but which may nonetheless already be forming in readers' minds. The suggestion that animates this article, that this distinction between the 'real' and the 'as if is problematic, is in no way tantamount to suggesting that there is necessarily no such thing as an 'underlying ontological reality' that may constrain possibilities for action in important ways. It is thus not an outright denial of 'world independence', which some writers attribute - mistakenly, in my view - to 'postmodernists'.28 It is a denial that, should such an underlying reality exist - which will forever remain a question - we do or can have access to it. On what basis do I advance such a claim? I do so on the grounds that, in insisting upon a gap between discourse and the world to which it refers, Wendt, Jackson and Wight misunderstand the nature of discourse itself by construing it as 'mere' talk, over which the reality of the world has some sort of priority. This is a mistake for two reasons: first, because we cannot have access to that underlying reality, so according it any sort of privilege seems unproductive; and second, because discourse is not 'mere' talk. The way we talk, think, and act in the world is what constitutes discourse, is what enables discourse to have the very profound material effects that it does.29 Discourse may not constitute all of reality, but it constitutes the realities that are meaningful for us. What of my claim that, even if there is some underlying ontological reality, we cannot have access to it? This seems to fly directly in the face of the claim that the state is 'real'. My disagreement here, however, has not to do with the reality of the state - indeed, I will insist that the state is real -but rather with how 'reality' is understood. The 'reality' that Wendt, Jackson, Neumann and Wight have in mind seems to be one that exists independently of our experience of it. This is the criterion of 'world independence', and it is the only basis upon which I can imagine a distinction between 'real' and 'as-if being sustainable. However, there are grounds to suppose that if such a reality does in fact exist, we cannot have meaningful access to it. We might draw just that lesson from Michel Foucault's account of the formation of objects, which can fruitfully be applied to all kinds of things, from atoms, to rocks and trees, to human beings, to states (in a manner that I will suggest below). He begins by observing that we are often able to recognise when a group of statements refer to a similar object: 'There are statements . . . that are quite obviously concerned 28 Wendt, Social Theory, p. 52. 29 This implicit distinction between materiality and discourse will, of course, not satisfy everyone, but the scope of this article forbids a lengthier engagement.

But, Foucault goes on to ask, 'what are these unities?'32 In other words, how do we know, when we engage in conversations about something, that we are in fact talking about the same thing? This question prompts Foucault to analyse the regularised ways in which the objects of our knowledge - called 'discur- sive formations' - are produced. Foucault identifies three 'rules of formation' that rule the existence of objects as objects of knowledge.33 First, objects of knowledge have 'surfaces' of 'emergence' that must be mapped. This allows us to 'show where . . . individual differences [among objects] . . . may emerge, and then be designated and analysed.'34 These surfaces of emergence vary across time and depending upon the particular object - they can include the family, the work environment, the setting of a negotiation, and so on. Second, in order to account for the formation of objects 'we must also describe the authorities of delimitation', those who are authorised to '[delimit], [designate], [name], and [establish]' objects. Third, 'we must analyse the grids of specification', which are 'systems' according to which different species of a given object are differentiated - types of madness, for instance, or types of criminality.35 It is easy to see how the state might be understood as a discursive formation in Foucault's terms.36 In the grand scheme of things, the modern state has not been a part of our world for very long. It was born out of the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648 in part by investing European princes with sovereignty in respect of official religion within their territories. This investiture, in effect, produced the modern sovereign state. Thus, we might see the Thirty Years' War, and especially the negotiations that culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia, as constituting important surfaces of emergence for the state as a political subject and object of knowledge. We might also point to various social scientific disciplines, like anthropology, sociology, economics, political science, and international relations as surfaces of emergence for the state as an object of analysis. Finally, there are all sorts of daily practices that also constitute surfaces of 30 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans. A. M. Sheridan Smith (New York: Pantheon Books, 1972), p. 31. 31 Foucault, Archaeology, p. 32. 32 Ibid., p. 32.

They do not, however, attend as systematically to Foucault's account of discursive formation as I do here. While I find this account to be theoretically fruitful in this instance, readers should certainly bear in mind that the accuracy of Foucault's own histories of various institutions - psychiatric and penal - have recently been called into question. See Andrew Scull, 'Michel Foucault, "History of Madness" ", in Times Literary Supplement 23 March 2007. However, damaging this review of Foucault's historical methods is - and I think it is quite damaging - this is not the same as a critique of his theory of discursive formation.</page><page sequence="8">370 Jacob Schiff emergence - those involving the criminal justice system, for example, or the assess- ment and payment of taxes, or those vigorous debates about foreign policy decisions in which we so often engage with colleagues, family, and friends. These surfaces of emergence function, as Foucault describes, to individuate and differentiate objects so that they may be analysed - so that, for example, social scientists can make analytical claims about the state; so that we can make the often politically important distinctions between sovereign and non-sovereign entities in international politics; and so that we can ground our everyday claims about what states should or should not be doing in some understanding of what states are. We can also identify a number of 'authorities of delimitation' with regard to the state. Here too we might include diplomats and other participants in foreign policy practices, and international organisations like the UN (to the extent that recognition by the General Assembly is an important element of statehood). We might also again include scholars in various disciplines, who have developed different kinds of criteria for assessing what entities should and should not be understood as states. In a more democratic moment, we might also grant to people in their role as ordinary citizens a certain authority to delimit the state, insofar as the legitimacy of (at least democratic) states is granted by the demos itself. Finally, 'grids of specification' seem like they have played and continue to play extremely important roles in international politics. They allowed us, for instance, to divide the world into capitalist and communist states during the Cold War; and they allow us to identify so-called 'rogue' states, failed states, developed or developing states, and so on. These kinds of delineations obviously have had crucial implications for foreign policy practices, for the theory and practice of IR and, perhaps most importantly, for the human beings inhabiting states so designated, whose lives tend to be affected in important ways by the kinds of states they are taken to inhabit. Taken together, though obviously without the rigour that a more extended analysis would afford, these observations suggest why it makes sense to understand the state as a discursive formation. For Foucault, then, objects of knowledge like states are not given but arise out of surfaces of emergence, are delimited by authorities, and are differentiated from related objects through specification. These objects, or discursive formations, con- stitute the realities in which we live and with which we are confronted - a reality full of atoms, rocks and trees, dogs and cats, and people and states. It is important to realise that Foucault never denies the existence of an independently existing, underlying reality. Rather, that phrase that is so often attributed to 'postmodernists', that 'there is nothing outside of discourse', draws our attention to the fact that the only reality to which we can have access is the reality that is constituted by discourse and instantiated (and reproduced) in discursive formations. Discursive formations may not be the ultimate reality - whatever that would mean - but they constitute our realities. Our realities may, of course, change as new objects emerge, are delimited by authorities, and their variants specified - this is one of the crucial lessons of Foucault's work on prisons and the emergence of the criminal , and on asylums and the emergence of the insane.37 As I've tried to suggest here, this insight also seems to make sense for thinking about states. But that realities can change does not 37 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, translated by Alan Sheridan (New York: Vintage Books, 1995); Michel Foucault, Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason (New York: Vintage Books, 1988).</page><page sequence="9">Critical reflections on state personhood 371 necessarily mean that such changes bring us any closer to some ultimate, underlying reality. Foucault thus draws our attention to the inaccessibility of an underlying reality and so, without denying the possibility of its existence, I will remain agnostic about its content and leave it aside. The point is that our reality, the reality that has meaning for us, is constituted, according to Foucault, by discursive formations. This begins to illuminate the substance of my claim that Wendt, Jackson, and Wight misunderstand the nature of discourse. As I suggested above, for them discourse seems to be 'mere' talk about some independently existing reality. But discourse, for Foucault and for me, is not just 'talk', and it is not just 'about' reality. Discourse does include speech and thought, in the form of what Foucault calls 'enunciative modalities' such as concepts, statements, and so on.38 But it also includes 'the relation[s] that [are] established' between various elements of a discursive formation 'by discursive practice'. 'To define a system of formation in its specific individuality', according to Foucault, 'is ... to characterise a discourse or a group of statements by the regularity of a practice.'39 Indeed, it is not just in language that objects get formed, but 'objects are differentiated in daily practice, in law' and, we might add, in IR.40 From this perspective, a whole series of practices, including the scholarship undertaken within the discipline of IR, statements made by government officials, practices of diplomacy and negotiation, and media reports and analyses do not merely refer to 'the state' as a pre-existing reality outside of discourse. Rather, such talk and practices produce and reproduce the state as a particular kind of object in relation to which it is possible to speak and to do. Again - because this is so often misunderstood that it bears repeating - none of this is to deny the existence of an independent, underlying reality. It is only to insist that the reality that matters for us, both to understand our world and to explain it - as I shall argue below - is the reality (of the state and of anything else) that is constituted by discourse. What's so special about persons? From the perspective that I have advanced, discourse is not just talk about reality, but talk and practice that constitute the reality in which we live, about which we speak, and in relation to which we act. One crucial implication of this understanding of discourse is that it erodes the sharp line between the 'real' and the 'as-if that seems to animate several contributors to the debate on state personhood. From my perspective, the state is real for us precisely because we think and speak and act as if it is - thus, I agree completely with Jackson that the state is real 'only because we act as if it were and consequently make it so\41 even though I suggested earlier that his analysis does not remain true to this important claim. In thought, speech, and action, we produce and reproduce the state every day and in a variety of ways - by, for instance, paying taxes (or not), by voting (or abstaining), by debating whether or not 38 Foucault, Archaeology, p. 50. 39 Ibid., p. 74. 40 Ibid., p. 33. 41 Jackson, 'Hegel's House', p. 283.</page><page sequence="10">372 Jacob Schiff a particular war is justified, and so on. The state is real precisely because it is a discursive formation. This thesis has important implications for Wendt's arguments, tacitly accepted at least in Jackson's introductory essay,42 about the unique explanatory power and the normative import of understanding states as persons. In one sense, my argument should alleviate anxiety about the reality and the personhood of states. On the explanatory side, it renders moot the question of whether the state is a person or not, and thus answers the 'explanatory question' of 'whether a discourse of state persons is theoretically necessary to explain important aspects of contemporary world politics'43 firmly in the negative. One of the key reasons Wendt advances for conceiving of the state as a person is that attributions to states of 'properties we associate first with human beings - rationality, identities, interests, beliefs, and so on - pervade social science . . . International Relations (IR) scholarship in particular . . . and everyday life as well.'44 Such attributions 'work so well' that, according to Wendt, 'it would be a miracle if [they] did not refer to something real.'45 The problem with this move is that Wendt assumes that there is something essential about or intrinsic to human beings (here again is that appeal to an underlying reality) that makes those attributions work independently of discourse, understood in its robust sense; and, furthermore, that those properties constitute some kind of objective standard in relation to which it makes sense to say whether certain entities are people or not. Wendt makes this point especially clear when he distinguishes between 'inside' and 'outside' constitution to differentiate humans from cats and dogs. Inside constitution 'refers to the role of structures and processes within the body of a person'. Outside constitution 'refers to the role of social recognition in making persons'.46 On the basis of this distinction, Wendt argues that cats and dogs in medieval times might have been persons externally, but they were never persons internally because they lack the necessary insides.47 The previous discussion of the discursive formation of objects may shed some light on where this analysis goes astray. Wendt assumes that what we now know about the difference between the biology of human beings, and that of cats and dogs, might have affected medieval practices of trying animals, if only the medievals had shared that knowledge. But the relative absence of 'sophisticated' knowledge of the internal workings of human beings in medieval times suggests that, had someone tried to explain to people in medieval times that cats and dogs were not people internally, they might have either not understood - since biology and related disciplines lacked a vocabulary for talking about such things - or, more importantly, they would have been indifferent. In medieval times animals were constituted as entities that it made sense to hold responsible for their actions. We don't know if they were considered to be persons or not, legally or otherwise; indeed, answering this question makes no difference for understanding why cats and dogs would have been put on trial. They were constituted as responsible beings and this understanding was instantiated in practices of trial and punishment. 42 Jackson, 'Forum Introduction', p. 258. 43 Wendt, 'State as Person', p. 293. 44 Ibid., p. 289. 45 Ibid., p. 290. 46 Ibid., p. 293. 47 Ibid., p. 293.</page><page sequence="11">Critical reflections on state personhood 373 Similarly, the fact that we attribute rationality, identities, interests, responsibili- ties, and so on, to states, in no way necessitates understanding them as people. Why not continue to understand them as states - states that may act rationally and responsibly (or irrationally and irresponsibly), and may have identities and interests, and perhaps even emotions? Wendt's insistence that states must be seen as people to make such attributions plausible, and that cats and dogs are in an important sense not people because they lack the requisite insides, misses the sense in which 'the person', legal and biological, in no sense precedes or lies outside of the historically contingent discourses which constitute it as such - discourses of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, anatomy, law, criminology and so on. 'Inside' constitution is in this sense no more intrinsic to human beings than is 'outside' constitution. So not only is it unnecessary to see states and animals as people in order to make these kinds of attributions work; more significantly, the fact that they do work on 'persons' itself ought to be seen as a consequence of the ways in which 'persons' are constituted discursively - and not as a consequence of some underlying reality of internal personhood. In sum, we need not care at all whether states are or are not persons. We can, in other words, remain ontological agnostics, at least on this point. States are states - particular discursive formations that are so constituted by us that we can attribute to them rationality, identities, interests, and the like, completely indepen- dently of whether they are or are not persons. States are entirely, luminously real - and they have profound effects - but we need not see them as persons in order for either of those things to be true. If we understand persons and states as discursive formations, then there is no reason to privilege personhood as the requirement for having an identity, or rationality, or emotions, or anything else that we typically attribute to human beings. After all, we say that dogs and cats can be lonely, or scared, and even that plants can be thirsty; and even though loneliness, fear, and thirst are things that we typically attribute to human beings, we have no trouble at all attributing them to dogs and cats without also having to insist that dogs and cats are people either 'internally' or 'externally'. However forcefully I have rendered this claim here, none of this denies the possibility that Wendt is right - maybe states are people; I simply don't know - but it denies absolutely that understanding states as people is necessary for us to make sense of our world. If in one sense I have alleviated some anxiety by dampening Wendt's claim that understanding states as people is 'theoretically necessary to explain important aspects of contemporary world politics',48 in another sense my argument should exacerbate our anxiety about the normative issues illuminated by state personhood. For the symposium contributors, the question of state personhood matters ethically and politically, insofar as it is bound up with the ways in which we live amongst others. As Jackson puts it, '[whether] or not the state is a person . . . has profound moral and ethical consequences, with immediate implications for debates about collective guilt and corporate responsibility. Person-hood is an inescapable component of debates about responsibility.'49 Wendt echoes these concerns in his own suggestions about the normative import of state personhood. First, he argues that the 'as if assumption - his framing of which I have already challenged - 48 Ibid., p. 293. 49 Jackson, 'Forum Introduction', p. 258.</page><page sequence="12">374 Jacob Schiff assumes a subject-object dualism . . . which . . . cannot be sustained . . . [SJtate persons can only be real as long as individuals accept and participate in their existence. Among those individuals are IR scholars, who routinely treat state persons 'as if they were real. Given IR's claim to authoritative knowledge about world politics, the continual performance of this narrative in IR theory contributes importantly to making this 'fantasy' a reality. To that extent, we are not objective observers of a separate reality, but part of that reality, and as such are at least indirectly responsible for its effects.50 An anthropocentric view is implicit in Wendt's position about state personhood. He seems to follow Jackson here in at least one important way - by yoking the concept of responsibility and the practices associated with its assumption quite closely to the status of personhood. There is, of course, nothing at all wrong with claiming that we ought to be responsible for the world in which we live - especially since it is a world that we are, in crucial respects, responsible for creating. I have no quarrel with Wendt on that score. I do, however, want to resist where this first move takes him. Wendt's second suggestion about the normative importance of state personhood follows directly from the first: For even empirically-oriented IR scholars, therefore, there is a question of whether states should be persons. Relative to the alternatives, I believe that a strong argument can be made that they should, notwithstanding its potential costs: states help bring order, and yes, even justice to the world, and if we want to have states then it is better they take the form of persons rather than something more amorphous because this will help make their effects more politically accountable.51 Here, Wendt implicitly recapitulates a version of the claim that I have suggested is so problematic - that there is something intrinsic or essential about personhood. He implies that there is something intrinsic about persons, something that makes it possible to talk about responsibility in relation to them, and that such talk is rendered somehow implausible if we dispense with notions of personhood. I have already suggested that this is unnecessary from the point of view of explanatory power, but privileging personhood also presents a normative problem. Wendt shifts ground here from a potentially plausible, if theoretically unnecessary, anthropomorphism, to a normatively problematic, perhaps even a dangerous, anthropoceÂ«msm52 - or from an analytic to a normative privileging of personhood. While Peter Lomas has recently taken Wendt to task for a 'bloodless' conception of personhood that does a disservice to human beings,53 he shares with Wendt this tendency toward anthropocentrism, which deserves to be examined and challenged. 50 Wendt, 'State as Person', p. 316. Given my argument in this article, it is extremely interesting to note that Wendt himself appears to collapse the hard real/as-if distinction that he earlier appeared to insist upon. This, however, does not necessarily nullify my critique; Wendt's invocation of performativity here seems to me to bespeak an uncomfortable tension in his own thought, one between an understanding of the 'real' as referring to some underlying reality, and one that refers to the realities constituted by discourse. Although tensions can certainly be productive, in my opinion there are good reasons - which I have spelled out above - to resolve this particular tension in favour of the latter conception of the real, but that is not mv concern at the moment. 51 Wendt, 'State as Person', p. 316.

Lomas, 'Anthropomorphism'.</page><page sequence="13">Critical reflections on state personhood 375 The problem does not lie with Wendt's claims about the link between personhood and responsibility, but rather with the tightness of the linkage that he seems to maintain. This actually gives rise to two connected problems, one more obvious than the other. The more obvious problem is that the close link between responsibility and personhood is tied in important ways to our respect for personhood. Because (for instance) we often conceive of ourselves as free, rational agents, with intentionality and consciousness, we want others to respect the choices that we make, and we often feel that, within limits, we ought to respect the choices of others. But these limits are crucial, because we also want to be able to hold individuals responsible for choices that seem to stray beyond those limits - into the realm of criminality, for instance. Thus responsibility and respect seem intimately interwoven. The problem, then, with linking responsibility too tightly to the status of personhood is that it seems to erode the notion that we ought to be respectful of (and responsible to) the non-human world as well. I don't think that these claims - that the non-human world deserves our respect, and that we ought in some be responsible for and to it - are ones with which many people (Wendt and, perhaps, Lomas included) would disagree. But I think that its force is gravely occluded by linking notions of responsibility too tightly to the status of personhood. The less obvious problem with Wendt's formulation is that, if my arguments about discourse and the constitution of reality have been persuasive, then it seems to follow that there is no necessary reason to identify personhood as the sole, or even the privileged, locus of responsibility. Think back to the medieval dog and cat trials in Wendt's example. However wrongheaded they may seem now, these trials served to organise social life around practices of responsibility in particular ways, ways that helped people to make sense of what happened to them in their daily lives. It may seem strange to us now, today, to consider holding dogs and cats (or, even more radically, rocks and trees) responsible for anything, and we might wonder how that would even be possible in practical terms - but that does not mean that if we did so we would be unable to make sense of our world, and to structure our lives in ways that could have profound, material effects. In other words, we can afford to be much more imaginative with respect to responsibility than Wendt's anthropocentrism seems to allow. I will follow up on this suggestion in the next and final section. In lieu of a conclusion: Toward responsible moments in green political theory For the sake of summation, let me briefly state my positions on what seem to be the two key questions animating the contributors to the symposium on state personhood. Is the state real? Yes, absolutely. Is it is a person? I don't know, and it doesn't matter. If state personhood doesn't matter, though, then what does? If questions about state personhood are potentially misplaced, then what questions might we ask? What avenues might we explore? In short, where might we go from here? In lieu of a conclusion, I want to briefly offer two suggestions in this regard. Even if, or perhaps especially because, state personhood doesn't seem to matter, we must devote much more attention to the manifold ways in which states enact their statehood, or what we might call their own being-in-the-world, as subjects and objects of desire, fear, hatred, rage, humiliation, suffering, pride, and so on. Several studies can point us in</page><page sequence="14">376 Jacob Schiff this direction, such as David Campbell's (1998) account of the production of the US as a subject through the articulation of dangerous or threatening Others;54 Meyda Yegenoglu's study of the production of the West through an articulation of its Eastern Other as mysterious and desirable;55 Cynthia Weber's (1999) account of the US' strategic self-production as a powerless subject in its 'intervasion' of Haiti;56 and James Moy's study of how the US has historically constructed Asian sexuality as a form of depravity which was construed as a threat to US sovereignty.57 None of these works relies upon an understanding of states as people. All of them illuminate different aspects of states' being-in-the-world that seem important if we want to understand something about the kinds of beings that states are. We need many, many more stories such as these if we want to begin to come to grips with the many and varied realities of states in international politics. This suggestion seems useful, but it does not go far enough; it only calls, in a sense, for more of the same. Once we strip personhood of its unwarranted privilege, however, we open up much more interesting and radical possibilities. One implication of my argument about discourse and the constitution of reality is that we may lose a great deal, analytically and normatively, by insisting upon privileging personhood. In particular, if we accept my suggestion that privileging personhood is analytically unnecessary and normatively problematic, and that no necessary constitutive link binds the status of personhood so tightly to notions of responsibility, then space is opened up for a politics and a responsibility that goes beyond both 'international' and, more broadly, 'world' politics. Such a politics and responsibility would be global or planetary. Following the intuition that seems to animate Karen Litfin's 'integral perspective',58 such a politics and responsibility would consciously and studiously avoid anthropocentrism, on the plausible grounds that all things on this planet and beyond are, or should be, worthy of respect - and even implicated in relations of responsibility - not because they are people, but simply because they are at least potentially involved in our lives as much as we are potentially involved in theirs. This vision of politics has something in common with several proposals advanced recently by a diverse array of political theorists, although it goes somewhat further. Green political theorists, for instance, have long argued for a more robust and sensitive relationship between human beings and nature.59 In many of those formulations nature, or the non-human more broadly conceived, are figured as passive objects in need of our care and protection. This is certainly true, and laudable, but such formulations also foreclose upon the possibility of a more active, engaged relationship to the non-human. Other theorists have gone further, positing a more active role for the non-human in their relationships with human beings.

Instead, Latour advances a hybrid ontology in which these categories are irremediably blurred. By calling our attention to the inextricability of the human from the non-human in particular, Latour opens us up to a world in which the non-human becomes a more active participant in our lives.61 However, Latour leaves the ethical implications of that relationship rather obscure. Jane Bennett pushes us further in the direction of an ethics of engagement with the non-human. Against Max Weber's famous thesis about the disenchantment of modern life, Jane Bennett has argued for the importance of recognising 'enchanted moments' in our engagements with the non-human and material worlds. The posture of wonderment that she advocates may open us up to new ways of relating to other species and kinds of entities.62 At the same time, however, this position of radical openness comes with its own ethical risks - the stillness provoked by wonder risks anaesthetising us to the sometimes problematic ethics of encounter.63 To be fair, Bennett recognises this danger in her call for 'collectively organized vigilance' about our relationship to the nonhuman.64 But the vision of politics I sketch above presses Bennett to move from enchanted (if vigilant) moments to responsible moments. It is a call for us to view non-humans, not merely as active agents who should evoke wonder, but as agents whose activity, like ours, implicates them in ethical relationships - including relationships of responsibility. 60 See, for example, John Dryzek, 'Green Reason: Communicative Ethics for the Biosphere', in Lori Gruen and Dale Jamieson (eds.), Reflecting on Nature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); John Dryzek, 'Political and Ecological Communication', in Environmental Politics, 4:4 (1995), pp. 13-30; John Dryzek, The Politics of The Earth: Environmental Discourses (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005). 61 Bruno Latour, We Have Never Been Modem (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991). 62 Jane Bennett, The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attachments, Crossings and Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 5.
