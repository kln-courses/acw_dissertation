Niering Connecticut College New London, Connecticut rn he primary emphasis of Restoradon Ecology is on ecological and biological restoration. The journal will publish papers on soils, water, air, and hydrologic functions. The editors encourage JEsubmission of manuscripts that emphasize a holistic approach and that deal with the highest level of biological integration-the human ecosystem. Restoration Ecology will not distinguish between basic and applied research, and will present both the fundamental and practical implica- tions for restoration. Restoration Ecology is published quarterly. Subscription prices for 1993 are as follows: Canada &amp; Mexico Qyerseas Individual $65.00 $75.00 $85.00 Institufional 105.00 115.00 125.00 E YES!

In the fifth edition of this highly successful and well respected textbook, the authors continue to address the fundamental questions of biogeography: why is there such a huge diversity of living things; what determines their distribution; and have they always occupied their current distribution patterns? Two important new themes underline this new edition. Firstly the involvement of mankind in all aspects of biogeography, and secondly, the global viewpoint, introducing more unity than the isolated fragmented biome approach. This new edition is in an enlarged format and as a result of a thorough revision, is 25% larger than the fourth. a highly readable account of biogeography with a strong ecological emphasis... well illustrated and supported by excellent examples ....... this book is a valuable addition to the biogeographic literature".

LESSELLS (Publications) Department of Animal &amp; Plant Sciences, The University, Sheffield SIO 2TN The British Ecological Society was founded in April 1913, when it replaced the British Vegetation Com- mittee (founded in 1904). The objects of the Society are to advance the education of the public and to advance and support research in the subject of ecology as a branch of natural science, and to disseminate the results of such research. It does this by publishing the Journal of Ecology, the Journal of Animal Ecology, the Journal of Applied Ecology, Functional Ecology and a Bulletin for members, and by holding regular meetings and symposia on subjects of current ecological inter- est. At present these are held in December, March or April, and July, in various places. The meeting in March or April is a symposium and that in July is devoted primarily to excursions to places of ecological interest. Additional meetings are organized by six specialist groups. MEMBERSHIP of the Society is open to all, whether or not they reside in the British Isles, who are genuinely and personally interested in Ecology and wish to Honorary Chairmen D. W. H.
