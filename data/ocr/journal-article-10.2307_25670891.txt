<plain_text><page sequence="1">People, Places and Paths: The Cypress Hills and the Niitsitapi1 Landscape of Southern Alberta Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar The landscape of the Blackfoot is a series of named locales linked by paths, movements and narra tives. The places are often outstanding natural features, river crossings, or resource patches perceived as focal points of spiritual energy. Myths and oral traditions explain how these landmarks were created through the actions of Napi who left behind songs, sacred objects, and practices to commemorate his creative acts on earth. This landscape is also created by people through their experience and engage ment with the world around them and through their activities and movements on the ground. As reflec tions of this habitual behavior, paths represent the accumulated imprint of countless journeys as people move from place to place conducting their everyday business. Although created by people, the resultant network ofplaces and paths constrains the patterned movement of groups over the landscape. From this perspective then, the landscape is not only the natural and cultural features of a region but also the names, oral traditions, and ceremonies, which establish the continuity between ancestral beings, social groups and the land. This paper attempts to position the Cypress Hills within the broader Niitsitapi landscape using the place names, paths and traditions of the people. Keywords: oral history, ethnohistory, Niitsitapi geography, place names, landscape archaeology In the study of hunter-gatherers, attempts to understand and explain concepts such as mobility and territoriality rely on constructs developed in evolutionary theory, cultural ecology, and evolu tionary ecology. Concepts such as seasonality and scheduling provide the framework to explain the patterned movement of human groups across the landscape and the arrangement of settlements in space (Flannery 1968). Similarly, constructs such as foragers and collectors assign primacy to the nature, spatial distribution and temporal cluster ing of resources (Binford 1980); they also assume the presence of rational individuals with perfect knowledge of the environment. These same eco logical variables account for the nature and size of the appropriate territory for specific groups (e.g. Cashdan 1983). More recent ecological approaches (Botkin 1990), including environmental archaeol ogy and historical ecology (Crumley 1994; Winterhalder 1994), attempt to incorporate cultural knowledge and human agency but focus primarily on human manipulation of the ecophysical envi ronment. Given their basis in evolutionary theory, the majority of these approaches focus on change and thus emphasize the flexibility or adaptability of the subsistence and settlement strategies of hunter-gatherers. Hunter-gatherer populations across the world have a somewhat different perspective of their re lationship with the ecophysical environment. To them, the landscape is a series of named locales linked by paths, movements and narratives (e.g. Basso 1996; Cruickshank 1990; Morphy 1995; Tilley 1994). The places are often outstanding natu ral features, river crossings, or resource patches perceived as focal points of spiritual energy. Myths and oral traditions explain how these landmarks were created through the actions of ancestral be Gerald A.

Throughout the year, nomadic groups reenact the wanderings of these mythological beings by following the same paths and stopping at specified places to perform activi ties and ceremonies in a prescribed order. During the course of these patterned movements, the prominent features on the landscape serve as mne monic devices which elicit the appropriate narra tives (Cruikshank 1990). In this fashion, the land scape becomes an archive or repository of tradi tional knowledge, and movement across the land scape becomes a journey through the history of the group. More importantly, the network of places connected by paths is created by people, yet serves to constrain their movement over the landscape. Not surprisingly, this perspective of the landscape emphasizes continuity, particularly in terms of the social and ideological connections between people, the land and the resources. To describe and interpret this patterned use of the landscape by indigenous people, it is neces sary to change theoretical orientation, to entertain different conceptions of time and space, and to rely on different types of data. For example, ecological models are based in the theories of Western sci ence while those emphasizing human agency fall under the realm of phenomenology or the under standing and description of things as they are per ceived by subjects (Casey 1996). The subjects, in this case, are the Niitsitapi groups occupying the Plains of southern Alberta and northern Montana at the time of contact. Similarly, the conception of time in Western science is linear?a progression of unique events?whereas that ofNiitsitapi groups is cyclical, occurring in the eternal present, though periodically regenerated through ritual to restore the mythical moment of creation. Finally, research ers based in Western scientific disciplines use re source patches to reconstruct regional settlement systems whereas those adopting phenomenologi cal approaches rely on place names and trails to recreate a cultural landscape, one that incorporates native perceptions and uses of the ecophysical en vironment. In this paper, we describe the phenom enological world of the Niitsitapi and then attempt to position the Cypress Hills within this broader landscape using the place names, paths and tradi tions of the people. THE HOMELAND OF THE NIITSITAPI Oral History Any discussion of the relationship between hunter-gatherer groups and their environments, of necessity, implicates territoriality (Cashdan 1983; Kelly 1996) or a related concept. Territoriality is difficult to define for groups who do not view their environment in the same way as sedentary popu lations and thus do not envision ownership in terms of specific parcels of land. Rather, hunter-gather ers understand their relationship to the environ ment and to neighboring groups in terms of rights of access to resources in an area. To the ecological anthropologist or archaeologist, these rights per tain primarily to the mineral and subsistence re sources in an area but include the social obliga tions associated with these rights of access (Cashdan 1983). To the landscape archaeologist, the rights and obligations extend beyond the ma terial resources to the spiritual powers associated with specific places. Thus, human groups who have access to specific material resources must learn the appropriate narratives, songs, ceremonies and ritu als to ensure the perpetuation of the resources by the spirits and ancestral beings. Failure to main tain this connection with the spirits and ancestors results in ecological disasters. Regardless of the approach one adopts, whether the exploitation of specific resource patches or the ritual movement from place to place, movement occurs within a designated area which, for lack of a better term, we choose to call the homeland of the Niitsitapi. Identifying the homeland of the Niitsitapi pre sents additional difficulties, due in part to poten tial overlap along the margins of contiguous groups and in part to the inconsistencies between histori cal accounts. According to the Elders, for example, the traditional homeland of the Niitsitapi extended from omaka-Ty2 (the North Saskatchewan) in the north to ponokasis- 'ughty (the Yellowstone River) in the south and from mis-takis (the Rocky Moun tains) in the west to the omaxi-spatchikway (the Great Sand Hills) in the east. No doubt, the Elders of neighboring groups such as the Cree, Gros Ven tre, Assiniboine, Crow, Kutenai, and Stoney could, 376</page><page sequence="3">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths and probably would, identify traditional homelands of comparable size with a substantial degree of overlap with the homeland of the Niitsitapi. As noted below, some of the overlap can be explained as a form of time sharing where contiguous groups use specific segments of their respective homelands at different times of the year. Such sequential use of the parkland environment by contemporary groups has been suggested by Losey (1978) and Nicholson (1988), while a comparable scenario for the use of sacred places has been presented by Sundstrom (1997). More importantly, Niitsitapi Elders maintain that the area defined above has been their traditional homeland since time imme morial. Any assertion regarding such continuity of use is often contested by historians, ethnographers and archaeologists who maintain that contact with Eu ropeans and the associated fur trade dramatically changed the political geography of western North America (e.g. Binnema 2001; Brink 1986; Forbis 1963). To a great extent, these studies rely on the earliest sightings of specific groups, most of which occurred during the summer months when these nomadic groups were in specific segments of their respective territories. Further, the people who de fined the traditional territories of the various groups were, for the most part, moving along the margins of the Niitsitapi homeland, using their ethnocen tric perceptions of territories, and often relying on interpreters with imperfect knowledge of and an tagonistic feelings toward the Niitsitapi (Bonnichsen and Baldwin 1978:24-25). We pre fer to assess the Niitsitapi perspective of their tra ditional homeland based on more extensive, albeit more recent, historical documentation. Written History For decades, Anthony Henday's account of his trip inland from York Factory, 1754-1755, has in spired considerable debate, primarily among schol ars who wish to clearly trace his western route on the ground and to conclusively establish which indigenous groups he met along the way. Even his name3 has been a point of contention. Belyea's (2000) recent contribution to these discussions has further complicated, yet greatly enriched, attempts to decipher Henday's journal. Belyea (2000:338) convincingly questions Burpee's (Henday 1908) reconstruction of the route traveled by Henday, leaving us "with no way of determining Henday's route." Not knowing where Henday was on the ground obviously brings into question earlier iden tifications of the Archithinues. Nonetheless, his various descriptions of the Archithinues' lodges, camps, rituals, and dietary preferences are consis tent with Plains bison hunters, including the Blackfoot. Alexander Mackenzie, who explored the lands north and west of Fort Chipewyan between 1789 and 1793, is one of the first to provide an outline of the area occupied by the Nitisitapii. According to his account, the Picaneaux, numbering from twelve to fifteen hundred men, are located on the head-waters of the South Branch of the Saskatchewan River. "Next to them, on the same water, are the Blood-Indians, of the same nation as the last, to the number of about fifty tents, or two hundred and fifty men. From them downwards extend the Black-Feet Indians, of the same nation as the two last tribes: their number may be eight hundred men" (Mackenzie 1971:lxx). During his trek through the northern margin of the Plains in the late 1780s, David Thompson wintered with the Peeagan Indians in the foothills east of the Rocky Mountains along the Bow River. His hosts informed him that their homeland ex tended from the foot of the Rocky Mountains east ward for about 300 miles and from the upper part of the (North) Saskatchewan to the north branches of the Missouri (Thompson 1968:53-54). Less than a decade later, Fidler spent the winter of 1792? 1793 with the Pekanow or Muddy River Indians in southwestern Alberta, traveling along the foot hills from the Highwood River to the Oldman River (Fidler 1991). In late September 1800, Fidler chose the confluence of the Red Deer and the South Saskatchewan Rivers as the site on which to es tablish Chesterfield House (Johnson 1967:268). During its brief operation, this trading post at tracted primarily the Blackfeet, Blood, Muddy River and Fall Indians. In September, 1806, the danger of meeting the numerous tribes of Slave Indians4 inhabiting the upper Battle River kept Alexander Henry and his fellow Nor'westers away from the beaver-rich river (Henry and Thompson 1965:500). However, at Fort Vermillion5 where he wintered, Henry en 377</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 gaged in lively trade with the Blackfeet, Blood Indians, and other tribes, though he notes that, since their lands were near the Rocky Mountains, the Piegans or Picaneaux traded at Fort Augustus6 (Henry and Thompson 1965:509). According to Henry (Henry and Thompson 1965:524), the tract of land the Slave Indians presently called their own "begins on a line due S. from Fort Vermillion to the South Branch of the Saskatchewan and up that stream to the foot of the Rocky mountains; then goes N. along the mountains until it strikes the N. Branch of the Saskatchewan, and down that stream to Vermillion river." During his winter with the Piegans at Rocky Mountain House, 1810-1811, Henry (Henry and Thompson 1965:723) learns a great deal about this tribe of the Slave Indians, and says the country they have inhabited since first en countered by traders on the Saskatchewan lies "along the foot of the Rocky mountains, on Bow river, and even as far S. as the Missouri." On September 27, 1822, Donald Mackenzie and a small party of Hudson's Bay Company men tried to reestablish Chesterfield House as a viable trading post. Within two days, trade began with over 200 tents of Blackfeet and Bloods camped nearby. In less than a month, an encampment of some 6,000 restive Indians circled the post. By spring, it was clear the experiment had failed once again. According to the final report, the Slave In dians (sensu Henry and Thompson 1965) were the primary cause of the venture's dismal output. Their fierce and cunning tactics had sabotaged attempts to hunt and trap, resulting in elevated costs and meager gains (Nelson 1973:66-73). Thereafter, the Plains were largely avoided until John Palliser be gan his expedition in 1857. Initially, Palliser had planned to travel west ward from the Qu'Appelle lakes to the site of the former post in late September 1857. However, the mention of Chesterfield House and the prospect of advancing deeper into Blackfoot territory alarmed both his men and Hudson's Bay Company interpreter, James McKay7. Reluctantly, Palliser abandoned his westward plan at Fort Ellice and headed to Fort Carlton where he wintered (Palliser 1863:55). As the second exploring season was dedicated to finding practical passes in the Rocky Mountains, Palliser had no expectation of explor ing much of the Plains, but he did try to go as far south as the forks of the Red Deer River. It was not to be. Only four days after leaving Fort Carlton on June 15, he learned that the Cree/Blackfoot peace had been violated and Blackfoot warriors were already on their way, thus eliminating any hope that his men would go southward. As the ex pedition moved west passed the Ear Hills, the horses were strictly guarded at night and scouts were kept on duty during the day because they were then in Blackfoot country (Palliser 1863:82-85). In the summer of 1859, Palliser (1863:133-142) finally managed to lead a "motley" crew of some twenty-four men through Blackfoot country, but it was a difficult undertaking, dogged by fear, anxi ety, and mutinies, all of which became more acute the further south they traveled. Along the route, the Blackfoot8 made their presence known with a steady stream of visits by scouts, soldiers and chiefs from encampments near the confluence of the Red Deer and the South Saskatchewan Rivers, along the Bow River, and near the west end of Cypress Hills. A decade later, when fur trader Isaac Cowie (1913:5-6, 244, 302-341, 432-437) worked to establish and maintain a viable Cypress Hills post, the fierce reputation of the Blackfeet had not di minished. In fact, the specter of hostile Blackfeet pervades much of Cowie's account of activities in and around the Cypress Hills from 1868 to 1872. Cowie claimed that his trading party was the first to venture the southwestern route to the Cypress Hills, noting that neither Palliser nor Hind had crossed the Missouri Coteau to the southwest, nor advanced much beyond the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan. These two points, the Coteau and the Elbow, he said, marked the limit of hunting ground controlled by the Cree at that time and go ing beyond these points meant braving the wrath of the dangerous Blackfeet. During his seven years as a trader, the intervening country between the western margin of the Coteau and the Cypress Hills continued to be a battleground. Despite the defen sive measures taken, Cowie and his people were routinely looking towards the Cypress Hills for signs of approaching Blackfeet. Comparable American historic accounts help to clarify the southern portion of the Niitsitapi homeland. On July 26, 18069, members of the Lewis and Clark expedition10 encountered a small 378</page><page sequence="5">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths party of Piegan11 near the forks of the Marias River and the two groups camped together for the evening. The Piegan told Lewis that their band was encamped near the foothills on the main branch of the Marias and that another large band was hunt ing buffalo near "the broken mountains", the Sweet Grass Hills (DeVoto 1953:429, 433-440). At the close of 1808, the Missouri Fur Company at tempted to establish the first organized trade at the Three Forks of the Missouri. According to James Bradley12 (1966a: 188), the post "was in the heart of the country then possessed by the Piegan tribes of the Blackfeet, whose hostility it was hoped might be appeased...". The plan failed miserably. Within months, the Piegans' systematic attacks on the post and the trappers made it impossible to venture out side the garrison except in large numbers. After some twenty deaths and poor returns, the company abandoned the Three Forks Post in the spring. As Bradley dryly notes (1966a: 190), "no further at tempt was made to trade in the Blackfeet coun try...". In early August 1811, a small party of American Fur Company employees, led by Donald McKenzie, left the Three Forks of the Missouri in late August, and began an overland course west ward across the Rocky Mountains to the Company's post in Astoria, Oregon Territory. "Ap prehensive of coming in contact with the Black Feet...they were obliged to proceed as far south as the latitude of 40?, from whence they turned into a north-west course." (Cox 1832:80-81) Undoubt edly, McKenzie did not conceive the limits of Blackfoot country to extend to present day Wyo ming. However, his chosen route does help to situ ate the southern margin. For the next twenty years, the fur trade only operated safely along the south ern and eastern margins, until the Upper Missouri Outfit established a trading post at the confluence of the Marias and the Missouri Rivers in 1831. According to Bradley (1966b:203), it was named Fort Piegan "in honor of the tribe which had con sented to its establishment..." Although Fort Piegan itself was short-lived, trade with the Blackfoot at the mouth of the Marias continued with relatively brief interruptions until the company sold its shares in 1864 (McDonnell 1966:239-240, 268-269). In 1833, Alexander Culbertson began his thirty-year career in the Upper Missouri fur trade at Fort McKenzie, the successor to Fort Piegan. He developed a good working relationship with the Blackfoot Nation, as well as a personal one, having married the engaging Natawista Iksana or Medicine Snake Woman, daughter13 of Blood chief Men-Es-To-Kos or Father of All Children (McDonnell 1966:240-246). In 1835, Culbertson reported on the condition and strength of the Up per Missouri tribes. At that time, the Piegans usu ally summered near Three Forks of the Missouri and sometimes wintered there, most often wintered on the Sun River, and ranged over the country be tween. The Blackfeet and Bloods commonly win tered near each other on the Belly River, summered on the Saskatchewan, and ranged over the inter vening country (Bradley 1966d:153). In 1853, Isaac Stevens (1860:31-34), Governor of Wash ington Territory, was assigned the principal duty of exploring a railroad route from the Upper Mis sissippi to the Pacific Ocean, as well as examining the geography, climatic conditions, and native tribes along the way.14 Stevens was authorized by the Indian department to hold councils and make treaties with those tribes not already under depart mental supervision, especially the Blackfeet. To that end, he secured the services of two highly re garded individuals, Alexander Culbertson and James Doty, to act as special agents among the Blackfeet and began plans to host a Blackfoot coun cil within a year's time (Stevens 1855:28-31; 1860:34-35, 86, 105). Immediately after arrival at Fort Benton in September 1853, Stevens arranged to visit a large Piegan camp in the Cypress Hills15 and instructed Doty to report on the Blackfeet (Stevens 1855:20 31). In his 1853 report, Doty outlined the general location of the areas in which they resided or hunted as follows: "By a line beginning on the north, where the 50th parallel crosses the Rocky mountains; thence east on said parallel to the 106th meridian; thence south to the headwaters of the Milk river, down said river to the Missouri, up the Missouri to the mouth of the Judith; thence up the Judith to its source to the Rocky Mountains, and north along their base to place of beginning" (Doty 1855:443). LANDSCAPE AND HISTORY Although Doty's description of the location 379</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 in which the Blackfeet resided and hunted is generally accurate, his use of parallels and meridians to define the limits of this territory is not consistent with Niitsitapi perceptions of their homeland. Instead, the Niitsitapi and their neighbors use landmarks along well-established trails to delineate the margins of their respective homelands. In this context, mis-takis (Rocky Mountains) identifies a clearly defin able and easily recognizable landmark serving as the western margin of the Niitsitapi homeland. Similarly, the confluences of rivers such as the Milk and the Missouri or the Missouri and the Judith represent recognizable land marks for the Niitsitapi and their neighbors and thus appear to have served as the southern boundary of the Niitsitapi homeland. However, neither some undetermined point 300 miles east of mis-takis (Thompson) nor the 106th meridian (Doty) provide the nec essary reference points to identify the eastern margins of the Niitsitapi home land. Fortunately, several historical accounts, dat ing between 1850 and 1875, identify specific land marks which seem to define places beyond which one was likely to encounter the much dreaded Blackfoot. From south to north they include the Dirt Hills on the Missouri Coteau, the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan River, the Ear Hills, and the Neutral Hills (Figure 1). On the 1874 march west, for example, the Northwest Mounted Police (NWMP)16 identified a formidable upland known among the Metis as the Dirt Hills17 "beyond which they seldom ventured for fear of the Blackfoot" (Turner 1950:1:137). These hills are located on the Missouri Coteau along an established trail between Moose Mountain and Wood Mountain. Similarly, Cowie recognized the danger of venturing into Blackfoot country located beyond the Missouri Coteau and the Elbow of the Saskatchewan River. Several trails converge on the Elbow of the Saskatchewan, obviously an important link be tween the Qu'Appelle and Saskatchewan drain SASKATCHEWAN ^jr ALBERTA y^" ^ \ ^^^^Ca^ ^^^^^^ .^r^- ^ i / &lt;xi Legend MONTANA ; ?_??

Further north, Palliser implemented special security measures against potential Blackfoot at tacks after passing the Ear Hills, a landmark along the trail between Bear's Head (Battleford) and the Bull's Forehead near the junction of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan rivers. Finally, John Sullivan18 identifies the Neutral Hills as "the rec ognized boundary between the Cree and Blackfoot tribes" (Palliser 1863:86). This landmark is also located along an important trail extending from the Blackfoot Hills located near the North Saskatchewan River to Blackfoot Crossing on the Bow River. That this eastern margin was not a recent phe nomenon, even in 1860, is evidenced by a Cree legend about Old Wives Lake. The lake is located just west of the Coteau at the northern end of the rolling plain separating Cypress Hills and Wood Mountain which the Blackfoot called aygh kimikway, 'Gap in the hills'19 According to the leg end, a group of Cree had followed the buffalo far 380</page><page sequence="7">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths ther west than usual20 into the Cypress Hills and thus into Blackfoot country. The hunt went very well, but before the people could return home, they were spotted by Blackfoot scouts. The Cree knew the Blackfoot would return with reinforcements. Burdened with supplies of meat and a large camp, quick flight seemed out of the question. At the urg ing of their old women, the camp was made to ap pear as if occupied, while the men, women and children left during the night, taking the meat with them. When the Blackfoot attacked the following morning, they found only old women tending the camp fires. In their anger at having been tricked, they killed the old women. Thus, the lake where this happened was named in memory of the brave old women. (Turner 1950:1:138; Barry 1998:267). The archaeological evidence tends to corrobo rate the hypothesized extent of the Niitsitapi home land and thus provides additional evidence for his torical continuity in the patterned use of the north ern Plains. For example, Peck and Ives (2001) have used the distribution of projectile point types and pottery to define three archaeological phases dat ing between 1250 B.P. and the time of contact. Of these, the Old Women's phase is assumed to rep resent the ancestors of the Niitsitapi although the ancestors of other groups such as the Gros Ventre and Kutenai could also be represented. The bound aries for the initial stages of the Old Women's phase extend the limits of the Niitsitapi homeland some what to the north and east while simultaneously decreasing the southern extent (Figure 1). By con trast, the boundaries for the later stage of the Old Women's phase define a homeland with a shorter east-west axis but a longer north-south axis. Sig nificantly, the Cypress Hills are included in both of the regions defined as the Old Women's phase. In a later publication, Peck (2002) examined the spatial distribution of iniskim (buffalo stones which figure prominently in various ceremonies and ritu als of the Niitsitapi), noting their strong associa tion with the homeland of the Niitsitapi. Similarly, Vickers (2003) studied anthropomorphic boulder effigies on the northern Plains and identified these as Napi figures based on the presence of specific attributes such as the life line and on the oral tradi tions of the Niitsitapi. Significantly, the geographic distribution of these Napi figures corresponds very well with the homeland of the Niitsitapi as defined above. Finally, in a recent study of rock art sites in Alberta, Klassen (2003) defines a prairie tradition which he attributes to the Niitsitapi. Again, this rock art style occurs within the homeland of the Niitsitapi. Together, these data establish the gen eral congruence between the distribution of iniskim, Napi figures, specific rock art, Cayley series pro jectile points and Saskatchewan Basin pottery, and the homeland of the Niitsitapi as defined by the Elders. Although the historical data provide an assort ment of accounts in which European, Canadian and American travelers encountered or resided with members of the Niitsitapi21, they were not the only occupants of this vast region; that is, these early explorers and travelers also met other groups within the Niitsitapi homeland as defined above. Signifi cantly, the locations of the encounters appear to relate to the season of the expeditions; that is, Eu ropeans who wintered with the Niitsitapi tended to be camped in river valleys, especially those within the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Con versely, encounters during the summer months tended to occur in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills and the lower reaches of the major rivers flowing through Alberta and Montana. To a great extent, these observations are consistent with the histori cally documented seasonal use of the region, as noted by Culbertson in 1835. Sullivan notes that the Blackfoot roam over the great prairies along the South Saskatchewan and Red Deer rivers dur ing the summer and retire to the northwest during the winter where they tent along the edge of the woods between Rocky Mountain House and Bow Fort (Palliser 1863:204). The early accounts of the NWMP document a similar seasonal displacement where groups moved up towards the mountains in the fall and formed their camps along the river bottoms which afforded fuel, shelter and food, particularly fresh bison meat (Canada Department of the Secretary of State 1877:20-21). During the summer months, therefore, the western neighbors ofthe Niitsitapi may have made excursions east of the mountains whereas, during the winter months, their eastern neighbors, including the Metis, may have hunted in the eastern half of the Niitsitapi homeland (Bonnichsen and Baldwin 1978:25-33). 381</page><page sequence="8">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 Such time sharing of adjoining homelands prob ably was much more common before the advent of the fur trade. PATTERNED USE OF THE CYPRESS HILLS BY THE NIITSITAPI Within this homeland, the Niitsitapi recognize a series of named locales linked by trails, move ments and narratives. One such locale is the Cy press Hills which actually includes several places of importance to the Niitsitapi22. Further, oral tra ditions and historical documents allow us to es tablish the nature and seasonality in the patterned use of the Cypress Hills by the Niitsitapi. Accord ing to Kainaikoan's account of "How the Ancient Peigans Lived", the Niitsitapi wintered along Cut Bank Creek and then moved onto the prairies, stop ping at a number of places to gather the resources needed for subsistence, for shelter, for medical purposes, and for rituals and ceremonies (Uhlenbeck 1912:1-38). Several of the places vis ited during this patterned movement over the land scape are situated in or around the Cypress Hills. When the bison were not far, people overtook them in the Sweet Grass Hills and then proceeded on to Milk River and Bad-water Lake to hunt more buf falo, primarily to collect tongues for the okan (Sun Dance). The group then traveled to Manyberries and Buffalo-head to pick berries before proceed ing to Seven-persons to hunt elk and then moving to the Cypress Hills to cut lodge poles. When the buffalo were far, people overtook them in the Cy press Hills, presumably after stopping at the pre vious places and traveling extensively through the surrounding country in search of buffalo (see also McClintock 1968:160). On these excursions, the ancient Peigans traveled through the Wide-gap to Round Forest, Much-Driftwood, and Big Sandhills before turning back and moving to Rotten-willow wood, Buffalo-lip23 and finally, Many-snakes where they found the buffalo. According to this Elder then, the Cypress Hills were an important destination for buffalo hunts, for elk hunts, for berry picking, and for replenishing the supply of lodge poles. Although not explicitly stated, these activi ties presumably took place during the late spring and summer as indicated by several other accounts from indigenous groups and early European trav elers (McClintock 1968:160). The area in and around the Cypress Hills also appears to have been a favoured location for the okan. Big Brave24, one of James Willard Schultz' informants, recounts one such ceremony in the summer of 1866. "In the Green-Grass Moon of that summer, Many Horses counciled with our medi cine men and foremost warriors, and they decided that we should have our great, every-summer of fering to the Sun this time at Divided Mountains (Cypress Hills, Alberta)" (Schultz 1962:276). Dur ing the summer of 1876, all of the Upper Missouri tribes traveled north of the Medicine Line to hunt buffalo in the Cypress Hills and then joined the Canadian tribes to hold a great combined okan on Medicine Coulee west of the Cypress Hills (Dawson 1881:4In). In July 1879, a large camp of Bloods, some 300 lodges, spent some time hunt ing buffalo south of the Cypress Hills before hold ing their annual okan near Fort Walsh (Canada Department ofthe Secretary of State 1879:18). According to Scalp Roller, a few years prior to 1893, the Piegan held a double okan on the same day but on different sides of the river near the Cy press Hills. On this occasion, Bad Head's camp was on one side of the river while Sun White Buffalo's camp was on the other (Wilson 1958:341). Katoya describes a similar event for McClintock: "Many years ago our people had a big camp at the lower end of the Cypress Hills. It was midsum mer. The four tribes, Bloods, Peigans, Sarcees and North Blackfoot, came together in the same camp. It was so large that our chiefs formed two great circles, instead of one as was our custom. My fa ther, Black-Snake-Man, and Lone-Chief were head men; Little Dog was war chief and Four Bears head medicine man. I was then a girl of fourteen; and in that camp I first learned about the Medicine Pipe" (McClintock 1968:89). According to Morrow (1923:59), both the Blackfeet and Blood Indians frequently held their Sun Dance in Medicine Lodge Coulee, located at the west end of the Cypress Hills. Together, these data identify the Cypress Hills as an important destination for the okan, a ceremony which lasted from two to three weeks during the summer each year. Further, many of the ceremonies described above involved large groups of people, often rep resenting all of the different tribes among the Niitsitapi as well as some of their neighbors. 382</page><page sequence="9">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths In addition, the Cypress Hills and surround ing area appears to have been one of the favorite camping spots of the Niitsitapi, especially during the summer months (Sanderson 1965:14-18; Stanley 1855:447). For example, the war record of Ninokskatosi, Three Suns, (also known as Big Nose)25 includes six events that happened in Canada (Schultz 1962:264-270). In each case, the group of Piegans was camped in or near the Cy press Hills. In 1863, Three Sun's group was camped on the Elbow River just north of the Cypress Hills (Medicine Hat, Alberta) while in 1870, a large vil lage of Piegans was set up in the Cypress Hills near the location of old Fort Walsh. On the other four occasions (1855, 1855, 1867, and 1875), the group was camped in or near the Cypress Hills at the time of Three Suns' heroic deeds. Other favoured camping places in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills included Buffalo's Head (Culbertson 1971:12), Seven Persons Creek (Sanderson 1965:14) and Pakowki Lake (Dawson 1881:42 45) Given this patterned use of the landscape, knowledgeable travelers through the area expected to find Niitsitapi groups camped at specific places in or near the Cypress Hills during the summer months. Thus, Governor Stevens immediately set out to visit a large Piegan camp "at their most fa vorite resort, the Cypress mountains..." some 120 miles north east of Fort Benton (Stevens 1855:23). Similarly, in 1866, Gros Ventres chief Sitting Woman told his warriors that the Piegans would be found near the Cypress Hills because they were especially fond of that part of their country (Schultz 1962:276). On his travels between Fort Benton and Blackfoot Crossing in the summer of 1870, Culbertson fully expected to find the Piegans in the vicinity of a spur of the Cypress Hills called the Buffalo's Head. Not surprisingly, he came upon a village of some two hundred lodges on a high level plain on the banks of a small river, likely Peigan Creek (Culbertson 1971:13-14). In short, the Cypress Hills were an integral component of the Niitsitapi homeland, especially during late spring, summer and early fall. The vari ous Niitsitapi groups apparently started to arrive at the Cypress Hills as early as the middle of April and traveled through the area until the beginning of October (Canada Department of the Secretary of State 1881:30; Turner 1950:1:414). They came to the Cypress Hills to hunt elk and buffalo, to col lect berries, to cut lodge poles, and to perform the annual okan. Thus, their movement across the northwestern Plains was motivated as much by the need to fulfill social and ceremonial obligations as to collect resources. During their travels through the area, they followed in the footsteps of their ancestors and repeatedly visited a number of fa vorite camp sites including Pakowki Lake, Peigan Creek, Seven Persons, and Medicine Lodge cou lee. As noted below, this network of paths and trails is accessible to archaeologists who are willing to view the landscape as it was seen by the Niitsitapi. THE PLACES The account of Kainaihoan clearly describes the nomadic life of the ancient Peigans as a series of planned moves from one named place to an other. The places, including those in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills, however, are more than re source patches and preferred camping locales. They are focal points of spiritual energy where people learn about their place in the world (Oetelaar and Oetelaar 2003). Myths and oral traditions explain how these landmarks were created through the actions of Napi or some other ancestral beings. The narratives, however, consist of more than creation myths; they also include morals and codes of ethi cal conduct toward the land, the resources, and the people. In this fashion, the landscape becomes the archive or repository for the history and the oral traditions of the group (Oetelaar 2003). As they move across the landscape then, the Niitsitapi fol low the trails used by their predecessors and stop at the same places to renew their ties with the spir its and the ancestors. Such regular interactions with the spirits are necessary to ensure the annual re newal of the land, the resources and the people. Movement across the landscape thus becomes a strategy to fulfill the social and ceremonial obli gations of the group and to maintain and transmit their history from one generation to the next. At a more practical level, the movements and day-to-day activities of the Niitsitapi leave a tan gible impression on the ground. The resultant net work of trails not only represents the accumulated imprint of countless journeys but also constrains the movement of people conducting their every 383</page><page sequence="10">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 day business. To simplify the communication of itineraries and to facilitate the identification of rel evant landmarks, the Niitsitapi assign names to these important land forms. The landmarks are, to some extent, dependent on the ecophysical setting and the prevailing mode of transportation (Oetelaar and Meyer, this volume). The names, in turn, are descriptive and easily recalled by the traveler ap proaching the landmark from a specified direction. The resultant network of paths and named places thus constitutes a concrete representation of the Niitsitapi landscape. Fortunately, many of these paths were used by early explorers who relied on Niitsitapi guides to help them travel through the northwestern Plains. The trails and place names included on their maps provide important insights into Niitsitapi perceptions and uses of the land scape surrounding the Cypress Hills. Of the 184 Blackfoot place names collected by Dawson, J.C. Nelson and A.P. Patrick, 29 refer to landmarks in the immediate vicinity of the Cy press Hills. Of these, nine are for lakes, rivers, and creeks (Pakowki Lake, Blood Green-water Lake, Peigan Green-water Lake, Long Lake, Elkwater Lake, Many Islands Lake, Milk River, Many Ber ries Creek, and Seven Persons River); nine are for upland locales (Sweet Grass Hills, Milk River Ridge, Cypress Hills, Wood Mountains, The Gap, Bear's Paw Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, Bull's Head Hill, and Standing Hill); four are for coulees (Cherry, Chin, Etzikom, and Seven Per sons); two are for sandhills (Great Sandhills and Middle Sandhills); four are for points along rivers (Writing-Stone, Medicine Hat, At Standing Hill, and Ford of the Drowned), and one is for a Ghost's House. Of the upland locales, Bull's Head Hill is of particular interest as an important navigational landmark. This feature consists of a small, yet dis tinctive rise along the western margin of the Cy press Hills. Even though this hill does not attain the size or the elevation of the neighboring uplands, it is visible from great distances for travelers com ing from the south. According to Culbertson (1971:12), for example, Buffalo's, or Bull's, Head Hill could easily be seen from 50 miles away. As such, this land form is perhaps best compared to a distinctive mountain peak such as Chief Mountain since it has a unique shape and is set apart from the more expansive upland locales nearby. How ever, the distinguishing features of this landmark are only visible to the traveler who, like Culbertson (1971), is approaching Bull's Head Hill from the south. Perspective is thus very important to under stand the name of a landmark but this aspect of Niitsitapi geography also provides valuable in sights on the patterned movement over the land scape. That is, the place name allows archaeolo gists to determine the direction of travel which, in this case, is entirely consistent with Kainaihoan s account. Although the criteria used to select outstand ing natural features are informative, so are the names assigned to landmarks. Some of the names, such as Many Islands Lake, Green Water Lake, and Long Lake, are descriptive, but the actual words have the unique ability of encapsulating an entire picture. The name assigned to the Cypress Hills, for example, is a-ygh-kimi-kway, which can be literally translated as the Divided Hills or The Gap, a particularly appropriate name for this up land which is dissected by glacial spillways. Simi larly, Pakowki Lake is literally translated as Bad Water Lake, a reference to the pungent odour of the water. Other names, such as Manyberries Creek and Cherry Coulee encode information about the resources available in the vicinity of these land marks. According to Kainaihoan, for example, these are the places where young people learned how to harvest and dry the berries. Still other names such as Seven Persons Coulee and Medicine Hat derive from incidents which occurred in the recent or distant past. The place names serve as mnemonic devices which elicit the appropriate narratives, be they oral histories or oral traditions (see Cruickshank 1990). For example, a Kainai group camped in the vicin ity of hi-tsuhi-a-tapi, or Seven Persons Coulee, might hear an Elder tell the story of the seven en emy killed in the nearby coulee whose bodies did not deteriorate even after days of exposure in the hot summer sun (Dempsey 1965:8; Sanderson 1965:17-18). The following week, while camped near sa-amis, or Medicine Hat, another Elder might relate the story of a human sacrifice to the soyii tapihsi or water beings who use this particular sec tion of the South Saskatchewan River as a breath ing hole during the cold winter months (Sanderson 384</page><page sequence="11">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths 1965:16-17; Turner 1950:2:9). A few days later, another group of youngsters camped in the vicin ity of pi-is-koas, or Standing Hill, might hear the account of how the South Saskatchewan River suddenly changed its course and created the ox bow lake (Figure 2) at agh-pot-sikimi, or "where it overflowed". This occurred because people in the long ago failed to make the appropriate offering to the soyii-tapiksi. The archaeologist trying to understand place names, however, must often delve beyond literal translations to the nature and structure of the words used. In the Blackfoot language, for example, nouns have one of two genders; that is, they may be animate and relate to things having life or they may be in animate and refer to things without life. Significantly, living things, from our Western perspective at least, are not always classed as animate among the Blackfoot nor are all inanimate objects in our world so classified by the Niitsitapi. For example, the word for Cypress Hills or a-ygh-kimi-kway is inanimate while the name for the Sweet Pine Hills (Sweet Grass Hills) or katoyis is animate. The different designations for these uplands are, of course, entirely consistent with native perceptions of secular and sacred ge ography (e.g. Dormaar 2001; Klassen 1995). For these groups, nature is charged with spiritual energy which is concentrated in specific locations. These sacred places represent loca tions where spirits contact the earth, often through wind or lightning. In the Sweet Pine Hills, the great winds emerged from a hole or cave at the top of the east butte (e.g. Dormaar 2001; Klassen 1995). The Sweet Pine Hills are also identified as the resting place for Katoyis, the name given to a spe cial ancestral being identified as Blood Clot who saved the Niitsitapi from various evil beings (Blackfoot Gallery Committee 2001:11-12). Within the valley of the Milk River north of the Sweet Pine Hills and west of the Cypress Hills lies aisinai 'pi26 or Writ ing-Stone. Although an inanimate noun meaning "it is pictured or written", this place name identi fies a location where the sandstone cliffs contain panels with petroglyphs of anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, and geometric designs. According to Blackfoot oral tradition, the rock art at Writing On-Stone was written by the spirits to communi cate with the living, often warning them of their fate. In fact, the voices of dead warriors and hunt ers as well as the noises from spirit camps can of ten be heard among the sandstone formations at night. Aisinai'pi is thus a place where the spirits -1?C fy m-1? 7 / /y^^^ y^^^^ ~ (j^^\ \^ 6 miles Figure 2. Sectional map of the Medicine Hat area showing the Oxbow Lake near pf-is-koas or Standing Hill. 385</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 dwell among a landscape of 'medicine rocks' and where people can communicate with the spirit world (Klassen 1995:9). More importantly, this contact with the spirit world has a long, unbroken history as indicated by the continuity in the oral narratives and in the iconic depictions. Sandhills, particularly the Great Sand Hills, also figure importantly in the cosmology and sa cred landscape of the Niitsitapi. According to Blackfoot mythology and oral tradition, the spirit of the deceased follows the course of the Crow Lodge River eastward toward the Sand Hills (Mar tin 1967:173; McClintock 1968:148). Although dune fields occur along the margins of Pakowki Lake, the two most important sandhill complexes in the immediate vicinity of the Cypress Hills are the Middle Sand Hills and the Great Sand Hills. The former, known to the Niitsitapi as sitoko ' spatchikway, are located near the confluence of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan River while the latter, referred to as omaxi-spatchikway, are situ ated east of the Middle Sand Hills. Either of these sandhill complexes could represent the burial ground identified in the oral traditions and, in fact, both may well have been used for this purpose. However, a Ghost's House or sta '-apewis is lo cated 30 miles northeast of the Cypress Hills; that is, in the heart of the Great Sandhills. This place is inhabited by the ghosts of people and of animals, which exist together in death, much as they did in life. Although the Sand Hills are surrounded by quicksand to prevent access to the living, departed spirits sometimes visit the Sand Hills and return again to remain among the living. It is perhaps no coincidence that one of the most important burial complexes identified on the northern Plains comes from the Gray Burial site located along the eastern margins of the Great Sand Hills (Millar 1978, 1981). This remarkable ar chaeological site yielded the remains of some 308 primary and secondary burials in 99 graves with many more left undisturbed. It may be presumptu ous to assume that this site actually represents the Ghost's House of the Niitsitapi, but the archaeol ogy does confirm the prolonged use of a sand hill complex as a burial ground by nomadic groups of the northern Plains. Of equal significance is David's (1993) identification of an artificial mound along the western margin of the Great Sand Hills. Perhaps, then, the Niitsitapi or their ancestors did indeed transport the bodies or bones of their dead relatives on their annual treks to the Cypress Hills and disposed of the remains near sta '-apewis. It is important to remember, however, that the selec tion of sand dunes as appropriate locations for the disposal of human remains may reflect little more than convenience since sand is much easier to dig than clay, especially during the summer months. THE PATHS As noted earlier, the named places are con nected by paths which represent the accumulated imprints of countless journeys by generations of Niitsitapi. During the initial journeys, the travel ers, no doubt, identified the most predictable and reliable routes between two or more destinations and may even have added a cairn here or there to help others identify the appropriate route. Once established, however, the paths themselves served to channel pedestrian traffic. Through the years, travelers along these paths would have attached memories and accounts of people and events, of songs and ceremonies, of trials and tribulations, and of encounters and incidents to places along the way. Soon, travel along the paths became a voyage back in time through the history of the group to the creative acts of the mythical ances tors. Given this attachment to place, it is doubtful that any group would be willing to abandon the trail network when faced with shortages of critical resources, especially since such ecological disas ters would be attributed to the failure of people in their dealings with the spirits. Although the sacred component of the Native American landscape has perhaps attracted the greater attention, the network of places and paths also represents an imprint of the day-to-day ac tivities and movements of people on the ground, including their annual subsistence round. Graspointner (1981), Johnson (1974), and Kehoe (1993) all use Uhlenbeck's (1912) account of "How the Ancient Peigans Lived" to reconstruct the an nual subsistence round of a South Peigan band (Figure 3). This group stayed in their wintering grounds along Cut Bank Creek until late spring at which time they moved up away from the river and camped in Battle Coulee along the Marias (kyo eis- 'ughty, or Bear) River. The band then moved 386</page><page sequence="13">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths to the Sweet Pine Hills to kill some bulls and traveled to the Milk (ki nuh-si-suht, or Little) River to hunt buffalo before making a circle camp at Bad-water (pa kow-ki) Lake. The next move was to Manyberries (aka ehmskway, or Many Ber ries) Creek to pick sarvis berries, goose-berries, and white-berries (red willow-berries) before traveling on to camp in the vicinity of Bull's Head Hill (ine-o-to-ka) to collect cherries for winter use. Thereafter, they traveled to Seven Persons to hunt elk be fore moving to the Cy press Hills to cut lodge poles. At this point the band split in two, with one group moving to Long Lakes before pro ceeding on to Where the-Women-Society-Left-Their-Lodgepole. From this location, the small band moved to Green Lake to hunt stray bulls before proceeding to Writing Stone to pick some more berries. The group then moved up the Milk River to Woman's-Point be fore returning to their wintering grounds along Cut Bank Creek where they cut more lodge poles and hunted deer, elk and moose near the mountains. Although Graspointner (1981) suspects that these groups may not have ranged over such great distances in prehorse days, the total round would have involved only 50 days of travel at 10 miles per day. Assuming that the group left Cutbank Creek in early May and returned by the end of October, the South Peigan band could have spent 50 days traveling and still had a minimum of 134 days to collect the necessary resources and per form the appropriate ceremonies. Such travel dis tances are entirely reasonable, especially if the group followed well-established trails. It is also Alta. Sask.

Map showing the seasonal travels of the South Peigan described by Kainaihoan (from Graspointner 1981). interesting to note that the patterned movement of this band appears to have been predicated as much by the nature and seasonal availability of critical resources such as wood, water, and berries as by the movement of bison herds. Of course, the im portant springs, aspen groves and berry patches were, in all probability, located along the estab lished migration routes for the local or regional bison herds. Nonetheless, such patterned move ment over the landscape may help us understand the importance of native spirituality. THE ARCHAEOLOGY If our model is valid, there should be a pat terned distribution of archaeological sites relative to the important landmarks identified above. To evaluate the archaeological record, we propose to limit our discussion to places identified by Kainaikoan but within a reasonable distance of the Cypress Hills. That is, we intend to examine the 387</page><page sequence="14">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 archaeological evidence in the vicinity of land marks located east of a longitude extending through the NWMP post at Writing-on-Stone. Within this area, the first stop is a place on the Milk River which, although difficult to situate precisely, is probably a camp site located somewhere north of the Sweet Grass Hills (the previous destination). It is tempting to identify the place as Writing-on Stone because the NWMP post is located on the south side of the river in this area and most of their outposts were situated along established trails. However, Kainaikoan clearly refers to Writing Stone as a distinct place visited by the ancient Peigan on their return trip to their wintering grounds. Further, during his archaeological inves tigations at Writing-on-Stone, Brink (1979) uncov ered only the remains of small sites with evidence of relatively brief occupations which he described as indicative of visitations rather than encamp ments. He also provides accounts by Elders who say the Blackfoot avoided camping near the petroglyphs because they feared the spirits in this area. Thus, the nature, density and distribution of rock art in the vicinity of the NWMP post may document the repeated use of this section of the Milk River but apparently not as a favorite camp ing location. During the early to mid 1970s, Graspointner (1977) conducted archaeological surveys in two large Borden blocks along the Milk River. Of these, the west tract was located just east of Writing-on Stone Provincial Park while the east block was situ ated several kilometers downstream. Although tipi rings and camp sites were discovered in both tracts, the density of habitation sites decreased markedly as one approached Writing-on-Stone. As such, the distribution of sites immediately east of the park mirrors the patterning observed by Brink (1979). Recently, Ian Tamasi (2000), a student in landscape archaeology, examined several cross-sections of the Milk River in an attempt to locate a place where coulees would provide suitable access to the flood plain using dog travpis. In his estimation, the best place to cross the Milk River valley north of the Sweet Grass Hills is located about ten kilometers east of Writing-on-Stone in the vicinity of the bridge for Route 885. Interestingly enough, he also identified a number of tipi ring and cairn sites in the immediate vicinity of these coulees. We will thus use this crossing as our point of departure for our journey to the Cypress Hills and back toward the wintering grounds of the ancient Peigans. From Milk River, the group moved to Pakowki Lake where they appeared to remain in camp for some time. Archaeological evidence for the inten sive use of this area was first noted by George M. Dawson on July 4,1881. During his travels around the lake, he followed a long arm extending west of the lake where a reedy creek or sluggish little river enters the lake. Unable to find a suitable crossing, he set up camp on a little stony ridge forming the north bank of this river (Figure 4). There he ob served a small cairn of stones and concluded that "[AJlmost every stone in this valley must have been handled at one time or another, with still many [ar ranged] in more or less perfect circles marking the sites of old lodges" (Dawson 1881:44). In the late 1960s, Bayrock (1966) and a group of volunteers spent two summers recording the more than 150 stones circles and other stone alignments along the southern margin of the same arm of Pakowki Lake. Several additional stone circles have been recorded in this area since the 1960s indicating that the west arm of Pakowki Lake has been an important desti nation for the ancestors of the Niitsitapi long be fore the advent of the horse. From Pakowki Lake, the group moved to Manyberries, a place today identified with a small community and creek of the same name in south eastern Alberta. Not surprisingly, Brumley (1988) has documented a sample of stone circles from the Manyberries area but the sample is comparatively small, including less than 40 stone circles. Perhaps, the lack of evidence for intensive use of the area reflects a change in the names assigned to the small creeks draining into Pakowki Lake. Today, Manyberries Creek originates in the Cypress Hills and flows in a southwesterly direction for some distance before changing to a westerly course and emptying into Pakowki Lake opposite the west arm near the northern margins of the lake. On all of the early maps of Pakowki Lake, this creek is identi fied as Big Timber Coulee while Manyberries Creek is identified as a small stream originating along the southern margin of the lake and flowing in a southeasterly direction, eventually joining the 388</page><page sequence="15">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths Figure 4. An 1883 map of part of the Districts of Assiniboia and Alberta showing the probable places identified by Kainaikoan. (1 - Milk River; 2 - Pakowki Lake; 3 - Many Berries; 4 - Bull's Head Hill; 5 - Seven Persons creek; 6 - Head of the Mountain; 7 - Elkwater Lake; 8 - Long Lake). Milk River. In fact, this is the only creek depicted on an 1883 "Map of Part of the Districts of Assiniboia and Alberta"(Canada Department of Interior 1883), hereafter referred to as the 1883 District Map. As such, Manyberries Creek may have served as an outlet for Pakowki Lake flow ing into the Milk River only during very high wa ter levels (Figure 4). If this interpretation of the historical data is correct, there should be evidence of intensive use along the margins of the original Manyberries Creek, today known as Lost River and Canal Creek. Not surprisingly, the Manyberries cairn and a snake-like petroform are located on a ridge west of Lost River while three sites with a total of 160 stone circles occur within a short dis tance of these archaeological features (Dormaar 2004). From Manyberries, the group traveled north and camped in the vicinity of Bull's Head Hill, a prominent landmark at the west end of the Cypress Hills (Figure 4). Significantly, this particular land mark resembles the head of a buffalo only when seen from the south and thus suggests that the name was originally assigned by a group traveling from south to north. Exactly where the group may have camped in the vicinity of this landmark is difficult to ascertain but it is reasonable to assume that they probably established their camp somewhere along the margins of Peigan Creek, a favorite camping spot for the Niitsitapi moving through this area. That this place was also important to the ancestors of the Niitsitapi is indicated by the density of tipi ring sites in the vicinity of this landmark. In her study of tipi ring sites along the 260-km segment of the Express pipeline right-of-way, Landals (1998) noted substantive differences in the den sity of sites per 10-km section. She recorded the highest densities of tipi ring sites in the 40-km seg ments near the Cypress Hills and the Red Deer River valley. Further, she attributed the very dense 389</page><page sequence="16">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 concentration of tipi ring sites to the topographic variability of the/ Cypress Hills zone. Closer in ' spection of the data reveals two pronounced peaks in the number of tipi ring sites within the Cypress Hills zone. These two 10-km segments occur on branches of Peigan Creek, suggesting that topo graphic variability may only be one of the factors accounting for the density of tipi ring sites. The other reason for the concentration of sites along Peigan Creek reflects the repeated use of a favor ite camp site located in the immediate vicinity of an important landmark. From Bull's Head Hill, the group moved to Seven Persons Creek to hunt elk. Even though Seven Persons is identified as one of the favorite camping sites for the Blood and Peigan, the exact location of the place along the creek is not speci fied. On the 1883 District Map, a trail extends from Bull's Head Hill to Seven Persons intersecting the latter approximately 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of the confluence with Peigan Creek (Figure 4). The Express Pipeline right-of-way also intersects Seven Persons but several kilometers north of the trail. Nonetheless, the only 10-km segment with a high density of tipi ring sites within this 40-km South Saskatchewan River zone occurs in the vi cinity of this creek. Significantly, this is the 10-km segment with the lowest percentage of land still in native prairie suggesting that site density may have been higher in the past. Only future research along Seven Persons Creek will allow us to examine vari ability in site distribution and to identify the im portant places along this water course. From Seven Persons, the group moved to the Cypress Hills to cut lodge poles. Whether or not these were lodge poles for tipis or medicine lodges is not specified although both interpretations are possible. Again, it is difficult to specify a precise location for the next camp but a trail depicted on the 1883 District Map extends from a point 9.6 km (6 mi) south of the confluence of Seven Per sons and Ross Creek to the Head of the Mountain (Hills). The latter is a prominent knoll located at the west end of the Cypress Hills but, once again, this landmark is visible only when seen from the northwest, that is, from Seven Persons (Figure 4). As noted above, Medicine Lodge Coulee was an important place for the okan and may have repre sented the destination for the group. Alternatively, they may have moved elsewhere to collect poles for their tipis. As noted by Robertson and Klassen (this volume), archaeological research has been somewhat limited in the Cypress Hills. Of the sites investigated to date, DjOn-8 has yielded a signifi cant quantity of cultural material indicative of in tensive utilization and repeated occupation for the last several millennia (Brumley et al. 1981). This site is located along the north slope of the hills at the west end of Elkwater Lake. As such, the camp site is situated near a large stand of lodgepole pine on the north-facing slope and near the figurative base of the Head of the Mountain. In short, the ancestors of the Niitsitapi may have moved from Seven Persons Creek to DjOn-8 to cut their lodge poles. From the Cypress Hills, the group moved to Long Lakes, a series of small, shallow bodies of water located within Forty Mile Coulee (Figure 4). Although it is difficult once again to specify a pre cise location for the next camp, a trail depicted on the 1883 District Map extends from Head of the Mountain to Forty Mile Coulee, intersecting the latter just north of the third lake. That Forty Mile Coulee was an important destination for the an cestors of the Niitsitapi is evident from the con centration of tipi rings within and along the mar gins of this valley (Brumley and Dau 1988). Once again, additional research may be required to de termine more precisely the favoured camp site of the Niitsitapi. Beyond this point, the group appears to have started the trip back to their wintering grounds in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and thus moved away from the Cypress Hills. In summary then, the evidence currently avail able, although somewhat limited and perhaps slightly biased, does corroborate the model for the patterned movement of groups from place to place. The places identified as favoured camp sites are located in the vicinity of important landmarks. Sig nificantly, many of these places also represent lo cations with high concentrations of tipi rings or multicomponent sites. Together, these data suggest a repeated use of specific places and thus tend to corroborate the Elder's claims for continuity in the patterned use of the landscape. In fact, the archaeo logical data suggest that the antiquity of the trav 390</page><page sequence="17">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths els described by Kainaihoan predate the introduc tion of the horse. There is also archaeological evidence to sup port the repeated use of this portion of the Niitsitapi homeland for important ceremonies such as the okan. As noted above, many of the recorded Sun Dances took place in the immediate vicinity of the Cypress Hills. Further, the okan generally involves the aggregation of different groups and the estab lishment of a circle camp. Although rarely docu mented in the archaeological record, circle camps have nevertheless been identified at a few loca tions on the northern Plains. One of these circle camps is located on the Suffield Military Reserve, north of Medicine Hat (see Finnigan 1982; Oetelaar 2003, 2004). Significantly, this circle camp is lo cated next to a medicine wheel, identified as the British Block Cairn (Wormington and Forbis 1965). Brumley (1988) includes the British Block Cairn in his Sub group I, one of the eight categories used to clas sify medicine wheels on the northwestern Plains. Although he is hesitant to assign a specific function to this category of medi cine wheels, he does sug gest that they appear to commemorate important events in the history of pre-contact groups in habiting the grasslands of southern Alberta. Cer tainly, the annual okan represents an important event in the lives of the Niitsitapi and, therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that some of these ceremonies may have been especially memorable events. If so, one would expect the majority of the Subgroup I medicine wheels to be located within the sum mer range of the Niitsitapi homeland. As illustrated in Figure 5, the majority of these archaeological sites are indeed located on the open prairie near the Cypress Hills and near the confluence of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan rivers. As such, the spatial distribution of the Subgroup I medicine wheels is, at minimum, consistent with the pat terned use of this area for the annual okan. CONCLUSION To the Niitsitapi, then, the landscape is a se ries of named locales linked by paths, movements and narratives. The places are often outstanding natural features, river crossings, or resource patches perceived as focal points of spiritual energy. Myths and oral traditions explain how these landmarks were created primarily through the actions of Napi or Old Man who left behind songs, sacred objects, y^^^^ SASKATCHEWAN ^Jr m. * /Edmonton V: ALBERTA /-S y^askatoon \^ ^-^^Calgary ^\ k I .^-/i&gt;rr^&gt;^# ..

This landscape is also created by people through their experience and engagement with the world around them and through their activities and movements on the ground. As reflections of this habitual behavior, particularly the movement of individuals over the landscape, paths represent the accumulated imprint of countless journeys as people move from place to place conducting their everyday business. The paths also represent meta phorical links connecting places, oral traditions, and ceremonies while movement across the land scape becomes a journey through the history of the group. Thus, the network of places and paths constrains the movement of people but establishes the continuity between ancestral beings, social groups and the land. Of course, this network of places and paths occurs within a specified region which we have labeled the homeland of the Niitsitapi. The extent of this homeland was defined on the basis of oral traditions and historical documents, both of which delimit an area extending from the North Saskatchewan River in the north to the Musselshell River in the south and from the Rocky Mountains to a line connecting a series of landmarks identi fied as the Dirt Hills, the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan, the Ear Hills and the Neutral Hills. Interestingly enough, this homeland corresponds very closely to the distribution of the Old Women's phase, suggesting considerable continuity in the occupation of this homeland by the Niitsitapi and their ancestors. The Cypress Hills occur within this traditional homeland and, not surprisingly, the lo cal place names and the associated paths are con sistent with the patterned use of this landscape. At the same time, the archaeological evidence, mea ger as it is, tends to corroborate the patterned use of this area as indicated by oral traditions of the Niitsitapi and the historical accounts of the earli est explorers moving through the Cypress Hills. Landscape archaeology, as the study of people, places and paths, represents an alternative approach to the study of settlement patterns, one that incor porates human agency in the analysis of regional settlement systems. Unlike many of its predeces sors, this approach provides insights into native perceptions and uses of the ecophysical environ ment. However, when used in isolation, landscape archaeology is subject to the same shortcomings as those noted for ecological approaches, includ ing environmental archaeology and historical ecol ogy. The ideal approach, as we attempted to dem onstrate here, is one that relies on multiple, inde pendent lines of evidence to reconstruct the pat terned use of the ecophysical setting by human groups. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper developed from a presentation by the senior author in a session entitled "Landscapes and People on the Canadian Prairies: The 'SCAPE' Project" at the 34* Annual Meeting of the Canadian Archaeological Association Banff, Alberta, May 9-13, 2001. The ideas were further developed through discussions with members of the SCAPE (Study of Cultural Adaptations in the Canadian Prairie Ecozone) project and through the historical research conducted by D. Joy Oetelaar. She not only compiled the historical data but also wrote part of the paper. The authors would also like to acknowledge Marcel Kornfeld, Susana Katz, Bev Nicholson and Dion Wiseman for their critical evaluations of the manuscript. Although we tried to be as accommodating as possible, we are certain that the final product may not have satisfied all of the concerns expressed by the reviewers. Of course, we alone are responsible for any errors or shortcomings in the final product. The illustrations were capably prepared by Dominique Cossu. Finally, none of this research would have been possible without the generous support of SSHRC through MCRI Grant #412-99-1000.

Proceedings of the Denver Museum of Natural History, Number 11. Denver. NOTES 1. As used in this study, the word Niitsitapi refers collectively to the Siksika (Blackfoot or Blackfeet), Pikani (Peigan or Piegan), and the Kainai (Blood). However, the names and corresponding spellings of the terms used to designate these groups in the historical documents have been retained. 2. Unless indicated otherwise, all place names in Blackfoot derive from the list in Dawson 1884:158-167. Nineteen of the place names Dawson (1881:40a) collected from Blood Indians, Bull Shield and Button Calf, in July 1881. Since Dawson did not speak or understand Blackfoot, it is likely that the information was communicated in a manner similar to Dawson's earlier meeting with an unnamed Blood on June 25th. The conversation on that occasion was carried on primarily through signs and some broken Cree (Dawson 1881:34). The remainder of the place names in the list were collected by Dominion Land Surveyors, J. C. Nelson and A.P. Patrick. Absent evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that Patrick and Nelson gathered at least some of the place names during their joint survey of the territory contained in Dawson's report, including the Siksika, Kainai, and Pikani reserves, in August 1878 (Canada DOI1879:45-49). Nelson's expertise in Blackfoot is unknown, but Patrick acquired at least a modest knowledge of the language in 1877 or 1878 (Canada DOI 1880:116-117). 3. In Henday (1908:32In), Burpee states: "The name is spelt 'Hendey' in a copy of the Journal in the Canadian Archives, of which this is a transcript. Miss Agnes C. Laut says, however, that the Minutes of the Hudson's Bay Company at Hudson's Bay House all spell the name 'Hendry.'" Burpee opted for the latter, as did Hyde (1933:30) and Ewers (1958:24-27). Nelson (1973:45, 52), Brink (1986:9-14), and Belyea (2000) render the name as 'Henday'. Arima (1995:8) gives preference to 'Henday', while noting three alternate spellings, 'Hendry', 'Hendey', and 'Hendy'. Small wonder that the text engenders such lively discussion. 4. In his ethnography of Fort Vermillion, Henry (1965:523, 533) is explicit about his use of the term Slave Indians, viz. "The Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans may be considered under one grand appellation of Slave Indians." and "Under the appellation of Slave Indians are understood the Piegans, Blackfeet, and Bloods." 5. Over the next few years, the Fort Vermillion trade became increasingly chaotic. Consequently, in February 1810, Henry and his counterpart at Fort Augustus, agreed to abandon their respective posts and build jointly at the mouth of White Earth River. This move was expected to have two advantages. Firstly, the new, more centrally located site would offer the same business potential as the present two posts, at half the expense. Secondly, Henry (1965:584-585) says, "it will also draw all the Slaves to trade at one place, where we can better defend ourselves from their insults." Interestingly, Henry does not mention the fate of the original Fort Augustus, built around 1794 by Angus Shaw and Duncan McGillivray, which was destroyed in the summer of 1807 by a party of Blackfeet, Blood Indians, and a few Fall Indians who "pillaged" the fort and sent its occupants fleeing for cover (Thompson 1916:482n). 6. According to Johnson 1967, xxx-xxxi, Fort Augustus, a North West Company post, and Fort Edmonton, a Hudson's Bay Company post, were built in 1795 'within musket-shot' of each other. 7. Palliser's journal underscores the impact that the HBC's retreat at Chesterfield House continued to have on Indigenous groups and traders. The entry for September 26, 1857 reads in part: "This proposition of mine was received with universal alarm among the men, who thought that they had done wonders already in having gone as far as we were. They urged that the party was not sufficiently numerous, and that to proceed any further into Blackfoot territory was too dangerous. I was quite aware that the Indians in that district had acquired a very formidable reputation owing to Hudson Bay Company's having established the Chesterfield fort in 1822 by sending 100 men, and even then they only kept it a few years, during which they lost a considerable number of men shot down by the Blackfeet, and at length abandoned it as too costly and too dangerous" (1863:55). 8. Although at the start of the journey south Palliser (1863:134, 138) anticipated difficulties with the Blackfeet, Blood Indians and the Pigeons [sic] along the route, he does not mention the latter during the course of the expedition's travel. According to the expedition list of groups seen and where they were located, the Peaguns [sic] were seen at Bow River and at Belly River (Palliser 1863:200). 9. Around 1912, the drawings of a Pikani winter count, 1764 1924 were reproduced by Reverend Cannon Haynes and Bull Plume's interpretations were recorded at Brocket, Alberta (Raczka 1979:4-5). Of interest here is Iron Shirt's drawing interpreted as: "1801 - When we took the stars and stripes from the River Indians" {Ibid., 33). As Raczka notes, capturing an enemy flag was an important act, the enemy in this case being the Pend d'Oreilles, or River People. Citing Dempsey, Raczka adds that it is significant that the Pikani captured an American flag four years prior to the expedition of Lewis and Clark. 10. Actually, the expedition had branched into two parts to allow Lewis and his crew time to explore the Marias River, leaving Clark to take care of the details in preparation for the return home. 11. As DeVoto (1953:435n) notes, Lewis misinterpreted the Piegans' signed communication and understood them to be the Minnetares of the North. 12. According to the Acting Librarian of the Montana Historical Society (Bradley 1966c:7), Bradley's work "based upon close observation and information obtained largely from first-hand sources, began in 1871 when he was stationed at frontier army posts, most of the time at Fort Benton and Fort Shaw, and ended with his death in the Battle of the Big Hole in 1877." 13. Dempsey states that it was the brother of Natoyi's-tsik sina, or Holy Snake, who was head chief of the Bloods 396</page><page sequence="23">Gerald A. Oetelaar and D. Joy Oetelaar People, Places, and Paths (Culbertson 1971:10). 14. Sprague (1964:153-169) nicely summarizes the Stevens' exploration, 1853-1855, which was a massive operation for its day. To carry out the broad range of duties, Stevens assembled two hundred and forty men, military and civilian, including two teams of naturalists and geologists, and a full-time artist. It was Stevens' 'Montana army'. 15. Stevens' (1860:105-107) decision to personally travel so quickly to the Cypress Hills indicates the importance he attached to conferring with the Blackfoot. On September 9th, he set out with a small party which included Culbertson and the expedition's artist, John Stanley. By evening, they were joined by a "considerable party of Blackfeet", led by the Little Dog, the Three Bears, and the Wolf that Climbs. On September 11th, Stevens received an express message that one of the principal planned railway routes could not be traversed by wagon, and he was forced to return to Fort Benton to reexamine the situation. The party continued under the direction of Stanley. For his report on the Cypress Hills, see Stanley (1855:447-449). 16. In his Introduction to Turner's two volume history of the NWMP, S. T. Wood, Commissioner ofthe Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 1950, classifies the work as representing the official and departmental history of the Force's first twenty years. Although Wood provides no specific information about Turner's sources, except to say files and records prior to 1897 were destroyed by fire, he says Turner's extensive research included interviewing original members of the Force (Turner 1950:xiii). For his part, Turner (1950:vii, ) adds "old-timers, Mounted Policemen, Indians, Hudson's Bay Company men, early traders, half-breeds and pioneer settlers..." to the list of interviews. He also had access to reports, diaries, and various other personal and official sources. Although much of Turner's material may be difficult to account for, a considerable portion is easily verified from external sources, particularly the annual NWMP reports. The present reference to the Dirt Hills comes from Turner's (1950:130) composite ofthe daily round of travel and events found entry in several faithfully-kept diaries..." from July 9 to September 29, 1874. 17. Henri Julien, a newspaper correspondent for the Canadian Illustrated News, accompanied the Force as they marched west, reporting on the experience as he went. On August 15,1874, the NWMP left their camp at Old Wives Lake and by evening camp, their new guide arrived from Wood Mountain, some 40 miles east. The guide brought news that, on the road between White Creek and Wood Mountain, "some Indians and one white man" had been killed, and that the latter had been tied to a tree and cut all over with knives. The news prompted Julien to remark, "It seems that the Blackfeet Indians did not fancy our coming into their country" (Julien 1961:22). 18. From June 18 to July 29, 1858, John Sullivan filled in for Palliser (1863:83-90) by supplying the journal entries for these dates. Sullivan was employed in a number of capacities during the Palliser Expedition, serving primarily as its secretary. However, he was also the party's mathematician, sextant and astronomical observer, and, from time to time, its journalist. For background information on Sullivan and other members of the expedition, see Spry 1968:xv-xli. 19. This Blackfoot place name which became part of Dawson's 1884 list had been reported earlier by Patrick (Canada Department of the Interior 1880-1881:114) who writes "I left Fort Walsh for Qu'Appelle about the first week of August; after a journey of six miles I entered the four-mile coulee called by the Indians Aygh-kim-mi-kay. This name in English signifying 'gap in the hills'." 20. Cowie (1913:302) notes a similar occurrence in 1868, in which the buffalo across the Missouri River were "deflected" from their annual northern migration route to the hunting grounds of the Qu'Appelle and Touchwood Hills Indians. Consequently, these groups were forced "to seek their prey farther west, well within the lands of the Blackfeet and their allies." 21. In "Indian Tribes and Vocabularies," Sullivan (Palliser 1863:200) enumerates the groups seen by the expedition and lists their locations. Information for the Blackfoot people - band, location, number of tents - as follows: "Blackfeet - Hand Hills (200), Bow River (500); Blood - Forks of Red Deer River (200), Bow River and Cypress Hills (150); and, Peagans - Bow River (250), Belly River (300)" 22. In Sullivan (Palliser 1863:200) Blackfoot tribes were the only groups listed as being seen at Cypress Hills. 23. Young Bear Chief, one of Grinnell's Blackfeet friends, identified Buffalo Lip Butte as being east of the Cypress Mountains, and having a little creek running beside it (Grinnell 1962:274). 24. The story of this particular okan has been especially resilient over time, having been depicted on Iron Shirt's winter count (Raczka 1979:57-58), and having been recounted by various other individuals. See, for example, Adam White Man to Schaeffer (Ml 100/158), McClintock (1968:160-161), and Ewers 1958:243. Although it appears to have been an unusually large okan in which the majority of the Piegan were present, the most memorable feature was that the gathering attracted a party of Gros Ventres and Crow Indians and, in the ensuing battle, the highly respected Piegan chief, Many Horses, was killed. 25. Charlie Revais, one of Claude Schaeffer's informants, also recounted many episodes in the war record of Big Nose, several of which occurred in the Cypress Hills (Glenbow Archives Ml 100/158). 26. This Blackfoot place name found in Frantz and Russell (1989:435). 397</page></plain_text>
