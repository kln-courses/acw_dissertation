<plain_text><page sequence="1">34 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) Anthony Enns Mediality and Mourning in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris and His Master's Voice Stanislaw Lem's essay "On the Structural Analysis of Science Fiction" seeks to redefine science fiction as a genre committed to the realistic extrapolation of technological possibilities: "the art of putting hypothetical premises into the very complicated stream of sociopsychological occurrences" (43). Lem's novels Solaris (1961) and His Master's Voice (1968) can be seen as illustrations of this definition of sf. While both novels employ a typical sf scenario-the attempt to establish contact with an alien species-Lem's extrapolation is anything but typical. In this essay, I would like to explore the ways in which Lem focuses specifically on communications technologies. Following John Johnston's definition of "mediality" as "the ways in which a literary text inscribes in its own language the effects produced by other media" (175), I will argue that Lem employs the scenario of alien contact in these novels in order to illustrate the various effects produced by competing media technologies, including phono- graphy and film. An examination of mediality in these novels will help to establish their essential ambiguity and also provide a possible context for their reliance on supernatural elements-their shared focus on the preservation and multiplication of spectral images of the dead. The enigmatic ending of Solaris, with its combination of science-fictional and supernatural elements, has been the focus of considerable critical attention since the novel's original publication. Early scholarship on the novel primarily addressed its more explicit arguments, such as its discussion of the limits of science and its claim that human cognition is inherently anthropomorphic. These early critics also connected Lem's critique of science to his essays on science fiction, suggesting that the Solarists' failure to conceive of something beyond their own frame of reference was an allusion to the failure of most science- fiction writers to convincingly extrapolate the possibilities of alien species. According to this reading, the closing scene of the novel, in which the scientist Kelvin experiences the "living ocean" of Solaris first-hand, can be explained as a directive to scientists and writers of sf to question their own assumptions and open their minds to new possibilities. Stephen W. Potts argues that at the end of the novel Kelvin is "an empty slate ready to receive the universe on its own terms" (51), and Mark Rose affirms that Kelvin "knows that the ocean is real and he is willing to commit himself to whatever the future may bring" (95). Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, critics began to suggest that the meaning of Solaris is actually indeterminate, an interpretation encouraged by Lem himself, who wrote in 1977 that a "fantastic work that has not yet been stabilized semantically by its recipients can become a screen on which readers</page><page sequence="2">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 35 project those meanings they consider important and urgent.... Solaris has not yet been able to produce a solid, 'closed' crystallization of meanings in the totality of interpretations" (Phantastik und Futurologie 1:373). In his 1984 autobiographical essay "Chance and Order," Lem likewise disclaims any intentional meaning in the novel: "Nothing I've ever written was planned in an abstract form.... I am still able to point to passages in 'Solaris' ... where I found myself in the position of a reader" (94). In a similar statement in an interview two years later, Lem described himself as "an observer at a printer, who sees the newspapers as they are being printed up" (Csicsery-Ronay, "Twenty-Two Answers" 254). Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. suggests that the indeterminacy of Solaris mirrors the confusion of the Solarists themselves, who are unable to decide on any single interpretation of the alien: "Just as the indeterminacy of Solaris deflects its explorers back into doubt about their methods of interpreting phenomena, the indeterminacy of the evidence in Solaris deflects us back into doubt about our own methods of reading" ("The Book is the Alien" 12). N. Katherine Hayles similarly charts the concepts of chance and order in several of Lem's books, arguing that his work "creates a mediating space in which openness and closure, chaos and order, creation and ratiocination, engage each other in a self-renewing and multi-layered dialectic" (294). The tension between chaos and order has since become the dominant topic of Lem scholarship, and in his essay "Modeling the Chaosphere: Stanislaw Lem's Alien Communications" Csicsery- Ronay explicitly frames this dialectic tension in terms of communication. The central concern of Lem's work, according to Csicsery-Ronay, is that any system of scientific reasoning is inherently circular and closed. This is an "inherent flaw in all philosophical world models" because "reason has no horizon toward which to orient itself, and no world of difference against which to test itself" (244). The key problem facing Lem's scientists is that "there is no way to set up a logical system-a matrix, a language, a unified science-which can be tested against anything distinct from itself" (246). Csicsery-Ronay argues that the desire for alien contact in Lem's work "is not so much a search for a ground for reason, or for an absolute Other" as "a difference in relation to which human consciousness can position itself" (247). He adds that although they are "fundamentally different," the aliens "share with human consciousness the ability to make models" (247). In other words, although it is impossible for humans and aliens to communicate through language because they are fundamentally different from one another, they are able to communicate through the use of models, such as Solaris' simulation of Rheya, Kelvin's dead wife, who represents "a being with which there can be affective contact" (252). Csicsery-Ronay even refers to Rheya as "a medium of communication," noting that it is only "through the mediation of models" that contact can be made (252). Recent criticism has followed this line of inquiry by interpreting Solaris as a novel focused not so much on the difficulties of conceiving of an alien species as on the problems inherent in communication itself. Manfred Geier uses Solaris to illustrate the limits of language, and Carl Tighe has suggested that the novel is a response to media censorship in Poland and a comment on the degree to</page><page sequence="3">36 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) which the media shape "how we see and how we are allowed to see the world and the universe around us" (768). Carl Malmgren links this discussion to earlier scholarship on Solaris by suggesting that the Solarists' inability to communicate with the ocean is the result of their tendency to anthropomorphize communication systems (29). The insoluble problem facing the Solarists, according to Malmgren, is how to decipher the "surplus of signification" that the ocean produces. The scientists are looking for a form of communication analogous to human methods, but the ocean produces endless "messages" whose meaning and intent, if they exist at all, remain unknown (29). Malmgren discusses, too, how Lem represents these issues in His Master's Voice, where communication with an alien is once again represented as an impossible attempt to penetrate a "veil of incomprehensible signs" (32). I would like to extend prior discussions by looking specifically at how the tension between competing or incompatible forms of communication is evoked in these novels by an emphasis on various forms of technological media. This reading acknowledges Csicsery-Ronay's argument that Lem represents alien communication as the "mediation of models," but I will relate this argument to the work of recent literary and media critics such as John Johnston and Friedrich Kittler, who have suggested that the twentieth-century novel responds to competition from new information and communications technologies by thematizing the effects of incompatible media forms within its own narrative. In their introduction to Reading Matters: Narrative in the New Media Ecology (1997), Joseph Tabbi and Michael Wutz note that in the early twentieth century's "changing media ecology ... writing and written narrative in general were displaced from their erstwhile centrality and forced to compete with gramophones, kinetoscopes, and their technologically more advanced successors in the marketplace of inscription" (4). Tabbi and Wutz describe how modernists such as Thomas Mann and Malcolm Lowry responded to the threat posed by photography, phonography, and film "by assembling congeries of facts, figures, and data streams that, in their self-conscious overabundance, were presumed to be uncontainable by these newer media" (6). They trace the development of this "engineering aesthetic" through the work of postmodern writers including Thomas Pynchon (who was trained as an engineer). Kittler adds that Pynchon's chaotic and fragmented narrative "builds almost exclusively upon documentary sources ... to which it adds ... schematics and differential equa-tions, corporate contracts, and organizational graphs," turning readers "from consumers of a narrative into hackers of a system" ("Media and Drugs" 161-62). Johnston notes that Pynchon's narratives can be read "as a recording of the delirious effects produced by new media and information technologies": the twentieth-century novel thus becomes "a site where the culture's possibilities for inscribing, storing, retrieving, and transmitting data are made available for critical scrutiny" (175). I would suggest that Lem's work can likewise be read as a response to the threat of competing technological media and as a site where the effects of media technologies are scrutinized. Like Pynchon, Lem has an extensive background in science and engineering, and the narratives of Solaris and His Master's Voice</page><page sequence="4">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 37 both reflect an "engineering aesthetic." They contain material from a variety of pseudo-documentary sources-including government documents, libraries, scholarly articles, and personal journals-that would be uncontainable by other media; and the reader, like a hacker, must constantly sift through this excess of information. Lem's interest in documentary material stems from his childhood, when he fabricated "masses of important documents," including "certificates; passports; diplomas that conferred upon me riches, high social standing, and secret power, or 'full power of authority,' without any limit whatsoever, and permits and coded proofs and cryptographs testifying to the highest rank" ("Chance and Order" 88). This obsession reveals an interest not only in the power and authority associated with documentary evidence, but also in the materiality of documents themselves. In this light, Lem's description of his working method as that of an "observer at a printer" reveals a similar awareness of literary texts as products of print technology. The clearest similarity between the works of Lem and Pynchon, however, lies in their representation of the effects of other media technologies. In Lem's work the delirious and disorienting effects of competing media are internalized and thematized in the narrative through the metaphor of alien communication. Rather than suggesting that this interpretation reveals the essential meaning of these texts, I would like to further the discussion of Lem's indeterminacy by looking at the ways in which his novels foreground the medium of commun- ication rather than the "message. " Such an approach does not promise to ascribe any determinate meaning to Lem's work, but rather offers a more precise way of explaining the texts' inherent ambiguity. Tabbi and Wutz, for example, argue that this approach offers a model of "[h]ow best to use the book in the new media ecology, and how to write about literary texts without resorting to hermetic modes of 'interpretation"' (2). While I agree that the essential meaning of these novels is indeterminate, it seems this very indeterminacy has compli- cated critics' attempts at traditional textual interpretation, forcing them to avoid or dismiss elements of the text that appear to be simply random or inexplicable. For example, several critics have recognized that Rheya is a supernatural presence in the novel and that Solaris is a science-fiction ghost story, but Csicsery-Ronay ultimately dismisses this feature by claiming that "[i]ts presence seems only to represent the natural tendency of people to create structures of explanation even when empirical and rationalistic conditions for one cannot be met" ("The Book is the Alien" 19). Although His Master's Voice is a far more realistic novel than Solaris, critics have noted that it too contains long digressions on death and mortality that have no apparent relevance to the plot; furthermore, like Solaris, its ending is unexpected and enigmatic. Irina Rodnianskaia attempts to explain these anomalous features by returning to the concepts of chance and order: "Chance, neutral and indifferent in itself, inexorably acquires the morbid ethical connotations of death, destruction, and decay" (357). Rodnianskaia's reading is clearly informed by Lem's own claim that chance and order are the "two opposed principles that guide my pen" ("Chance and Order" 88); yet this interpretation does not fully explain the</page><page sequence="5">38 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) connection between the problem of alien communication and the book's meditations on death. I believe these seemingly anomalous features can be explained by looking at Solaris and His Master's Voice as novels about the problems associated with communications technologies. While the meaning of the ocean's communications in Solaris remains ambiguous and untranslatable, the ocean itself is repeatedly shown to be capable of reading, storing, and transmitting information; and the metaphors used to describe its behavior frequently compare it to various forms of technological media, such as phonography and film. The scientists, on the other hand, are more often associated with print technologies, and their attempts to interpret the alien phenomena are always mediated through written reports and printed material. And in His Master's Voice, alien commun-ication is only made possible through a recorded message: rather than illustrating human contact with an alien presence, the novel actually depicts human contact with a form of technological media. While Malmgren is correct in pointing out that the scientists' failure to decipher the message reveals their inability to conceive of non-human forms of communication, I would suggest that their failure also suggests that consciousness itself is a product of mediality, or what Johnston calls a "reading effect": "Within the force field delineated by these intersecting but separate technological media, the status of consciousness becomes uncertain, implicitly equivalent to a reading effect" (177). Following the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan, Johnston explains that consciousness is "the result of a machinic interplay between a perceptual apparatus, a recording device, and a symbolic system," and he adds that the unconscious is "insistently emerging in the ruptures or breaks of representation" (178). In other words, consciousness itself is shaped by media technologies, because these technologies determine what sorts of information are capable of being perceived, recorded, and stored. And when certain types of information cannot be perceived by the "perceptual apparatus," these gaps mark the location of the unconscious. By metaphorically presenting incompatible media technologies as apparently sentient alien beings, Lem's novels clearly illustrate the notion that new technologies shape and determine consciousness by perceiving, recording, and storing new types of information, such as the ability of phonography and film to preserve images and voices of the dead. My reading offers a better explanation of the supernatural or ghostly elements in these novels because it reveals the ways in which new media technologies are able to perceive, record, and store information which was unrepresentable by earlier technologies and which therefore once belonged to the unconscious. In other words, Solaris and His Master's Voice ultimately reveal the ways in which the "delirious effects" of technological media influence human consciousness by prolonging the work of mourning through the preservation of the deceased. In this paper, I will explain the relationship between mediality and mourning by looking more closely at the ways in which Lem represents the effects produced by other communication technologies. Lem's emphasis on communications technologies is made clear from the beginning of Solaris, as the scientist Kelvin approaches the research station on</page><page sequence="6">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 39 Solaris in a space capsule. After several failed attempts, Kelvin is unable to establish contact with the station: "I waited a moment in silence before trying once more to make contact. No response" (3). Kelvin then notes that "Succes- sive bursts of static came through the headphones, against a background of deep, low-pitched murmuring, which seemed to me the very voice of the planet itself' (3). Although Kelvin has already done extensive scholarly work in the field of "Solaristics," a fictional branch of science dedicated to studying the living ocean on Solaris, this scene represents his first real "encounter" with the alien presence, and it is significant not only that the alien takes the form of a radio transmission, but that Kelvin's encounter with it is mediated by a radio. The alien's incomprehensible "deep, low-pitched murmuring" clearly establishes the ocean as an omnipresent force whose purpose remains inscrutable. Yet the fact that the encounter is mediated by the radio also reveals the degree to which contact between humans and aliens is dependent on communications techno- logies, an emphasis that will continue throughout the novel. Another pattern that this scene establishes can be seen in the failed communication between the human scientists themselves. Kelvin eventually receives an automated response from the station, but he is never contacted by the other Solarists directly; communication between them remains problematic throughout the novel. On one level, their difficulties in communicating with one another are presented as the difficulties of bridging disciplinary boundaries. Kelvin describes how Solarist-cyberneticians were unable to communicate with Solarist-symmetriadologists at the Solarist Institute, and he recalls a joke made by the director: "How do you expect to communicate with the ocean, when you can't even understand one another?" (22). But the inability of the scientists to communicate with one another is also presented as an inability to connect emotionally and as a desire for privacy. After the ocean begins sending mysterious "visitors" to the scientists, which turn out to be manifestations of the scientists' own innermost psychic traumas and desires, they rarely speak to one another in person, preferring instead to communicate through videophones, although even these communications are frequently interrupted and distorted. The scientists' first meeting occurs over a three-way videophone link, but in order to maintain their privacy, the scientists do not use the phone's video feature; instead, they communicate with their telescreen lenses covered. When Snow, the station's Solarist-cybernetician, informs Kelvin about the meeting, Kelvin asks him to come over in person, but Snow immediately "erupts" at his unseen visitor: "Stop that, do you hear? I told you to stop it!" (97). Sartorius is similarly interrupted during the conference by his visitor, a child wearing a straw hat, who attempts to remove the cover from his telescreen lens. Sartorius yells at him: "Go away! Go away!" (105). At the end of the meeting, Kelvin makes another plea for a face-to-face meeting, but Snow again hesitates: "OK, but I don't know when" (105). The novel most clearly illustrates the estranging effects of communications media through its representation of the alien ocean itself, which is repeatedly emphasized as a device for the recording, storage, and transmission of information. Snow theorizes that because the ocean knows all their unconscious</page><page sequence="7">40 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) erotic and guilt fixations, it must be able to read their minds; he points out that all this unconscious data has been "imprinted on the mind" and "stored in terms of nucleic acids etching asynchronous large-moleculed crystals" (193). Like early accounts of brain mapping, Snow's description of psychic information as "imprinted" and "stored" in the mind relies on phonographic metaphors, perfectly illustrating Kittler's claim that a "brain physiology that ... located speaking, hearing, writing, and reading in various parts of the brain ... had to model itself on the phonograph" (Gramophone 38). The connection between the ocean's recording of stored psychic data and phonography is made even more explicit when Kelvin theorizes that the continual return of the visitors suggests "they are plugged into a contrivance which goes round and round ... like a gramophone record" (104). The scientists' failure to understand the purpose of these visitors-in other words, to comprehend the meaning of the ocean's repeatedly broadcasted message-reveals that the humans and the alien are using incompatible communication systems. Snow's explanation of psychic storage is particularly relevant here because Snow is the station's cybernetician. Lem has said that he relied on Norbert Wiener's The Human Use of Human Beings (1954) as the basis for his novels Eden and The Invincible, as well as Solaris ("Chance and Order" 92). Wiener's book, one of the founding texts of cybernetics, argues that human beings are fundamentally similar to machines: Man is immersed in a world which he perceives through his sense organs. Information that he receives is co-ordinated through his brain and nervous system until, after the proper process of storage, collation, and selection, it emerges through effector organs, generally his muscles. These in turn act on the external world, and also react on the central nervous system through receptor organs such as the end organs of kinaesthesia; and the information received by the kinaesthetic organs is combined with his already accumulated store of infor- mation to influence future action. (17) Wiener calls this process a "feedback loop," and he claims that "the physical functioning of the living individual and the operation of some of the newer communication machines are precisely parallel" (26). Snow's comparison of human mental functions with phonograph records likewise casts the human characters themselves as machines for the "storage, collation, and selection" of information. The scientists, like the ocean, gradually come to be seen as communication devices themselves, a perception emphasized at the end of the novel when Snow and Sartorius record an encephalogram of Kelvin, "a complete record of the workings of my brain, " and transmit it to the ocean in order to stop the visitations (155). That the visitations do eventually stop as a result of this experiment seems to indicate that a "feedback loop" has been achieved. Although the precise meaning of the ocean's message remains unclear at the end of the novel, some form of communication between the humans and the ocean has taken place, and this communication has been facilitated by the use of a compatible form of technological media. The novel represents the human characters as cybernetic systems that store information like phonograph records; the ocean is represented as a recording</page><page sequence="8">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 41 device capable of reading them. But it is significant that the kind of information that is being recorded from the scientists' brains is composed of deeply repressed erotic and guilt fixations. Kelvin is obsessed with his dead wife Rheya, who committed suicide ten years before, Gibarian with "a giant Negress," and Sartorius with the child in the straw hat. Several critics have commented on the role of sexuality and the unconscious in the novel. David Ketterer has, for example, traced the birth imagery in the opening chapter, arguing that the entire novel is informed by the themes of incest and illegitimate sons: "the begetting of Solaris," he claims, is represented as the "result of the incestuous sexual union of man and mother Earth" (87). Elyce Rae H,elford also acknowledges the birth imagery in the opening chapter but uses Lacanian psychoanalysis to argue that the novel traces the psychic development of a man from birth through the mirror stage, ultimately revealing the patriarchal assumptions underlying psychoanalysis itself. There is no question that Solaris is deeply informed by psychoanalysis, but I believe that a psychoanalytic reading of the novel remains incomplete without acknowledging the relationship between media and the unconscious. Kittler points out that the phonograph became an important part of psychoanalysis because it was not only an accurate storage medium but was also capable of recording all of the "nonsense that ... technological media alone could bring into the open" (Gramophone 89). In other words, technological media, like memory, were capable of recording information of which people were not consciously aware. Kittler argues therefore that Freud's "principle that consciousness and memory are mutually exclusive" follows a "media logic" (89). In his book Aberrations of Mourning, Laurence Rickels also points out that in Freud's work "psychotic projections, psychoanalytic conceptions of the unconscious, and the technical media converge," and he illustrates this by examining Freud's fascination with the telephone, which he compared to the process of telepathy (19). John Durham Peters extends this discussion of telepathy by explaining how this psychic phenomenon was originally modeled on the telegraph and the telephone, and that it embodied the fantasy of pure communication between minds across vast distances of space and time (105-6). This relationship between communications technologies, psychoanalysis, and telepathy can clearly be seen in Solaris, where technological media allow the recording and storage of previously unconscious thoughts and emotions. The relationship between media and psychoanalysis can be seen most clearly through the technology of film. According to Kittler, from the very beginning of psychoanalysis, the unconscious was represented through reference to imaging technologies. In The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud suggests that "we should picture the instrument which carries out our mental functions as resembling a compound microscope or a photographic apparatus, or something of the kind" (5: 536). Following this logic, Kittler claims that "dreams are films and vice versa" (Gramophone 159); he compares the process of psychoanalysis to techniques of film editing: "[P]sychoanalysis means chopping up an internal film, in steps that are as methodical as they are discrete" (143). Film technology therefore "uncovers unconscious processes of the central</page><page sequence="9">42 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) nervous system ... with a precision that is otherwise accessible only to experiment and thus neither to consciousness nor to language" (161). In other words, film is capable of perceiving, recording, and storing information that is inaccessible to language, and therefore offers a perfect metaphor for unconscious thoughts and emotions that are inaccessible to consciousness. This relationship between film and the unconscious can be clearly seen near the end of Solaris, when the ocean attempts to communicate with Kelvin through a series of "visions": "I have never had visions of that kind before or since, so I decided to note them down and to transcribe them approximately, in so far as my vocabulary permits, given that I can convey only fragmentary glimpses almost entirely denuded of an incommunicable horror" (178). The ocean's telepathic communications with Kelvin are described as dreams that follow a film logic; and the difficulty of translating these visions into language illustrates the tensions between film and print, two incompatible media. The horrific aspect of these visions is that they all involve the fragmentation of the self. For example, in one vision Kelvin describes losing his body: "I am the prisoner of an alien matter and my body is clothed in a dead, formless substance-or rather I have no body, I am that alien matter" (179). He later describes the presence of another creature, possibly a woman: "Our white, naked bodies dissolve into a swarm of black creeping things, and I am-we are-a mass of glutinous coiling worms, endless, in that infinity ... I am dispersed in all directions" (180). In another vision, Kelvin notes, "I crumbled, disintegrated, and only emptiness remained" (180). According to Kittler, film technology is also tied to a disintegration of the self, and he argues that "films anatomize the imaginary picture of the body that endows humans ... with a borrowed I"(Gramophone 150). Like the technology of film, these visions also reveal that Kelvin's notion of himself as a fully integrated being is itself a product of print technology, or in Kittler's words: "[t]he soul, the inner self, the individual: they all were only the effects of an illusion, neutralized through the hallucination of reading and widespread literacy" (151). Throughout the novel there are recurrent references to the ability of technological media to record and store unconscious thoughts and emotions, and these are conveyed by references specifically to the technology of film. Several passages catalogue the various colloidal shapes and structures that the ocean produces. One of these structures, the "mimoids," are reproductions of objects in the vicinity of the ocean. Not only do these mimetic structures demonstrate that the ocean can record, store, and transmit information it has received, but Kelvin compares them to film images because they are maintained through planetary "pulsations." Like film, the frequency of these pulsations make them "invisible to the naked eye," and when they weaken, the object "'lives' in slow motion" (115). Sartorius makes a similar reference to the technology of film when he refers to the visitors as "projections" emanating from the ocean (102). This reference seems particularly significant when considered within the context of Kittler's claim that the invention of film led to "an immeasurable expansion of the realms of the dead" (Gramophone 125). Johnston adds that "the realm of the dead has the same dimensions as the storage and emission capacities of its</page><page sequence="10">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 43 culture": film multiplies the realms of the dead by generating spectral images of people who are no longer alive (183). The ocean's mimoid structures function, as mentioned, as recordings or simulations of data. Kelvin finds an account of the first sighted mimoid structure, which occurred after a pilot named Fechner accidentally crashed into the ocean and died. Another pilot, Berton, soon claims to have seen a mimoid that replicates Fechner's memories of the place where he grew up, as well as Fechner's own body as a child. Dr. Archibald Messenger, the one scientist who takes Berton's claims seriously, claims that the source of the mimoid "is Fechner-or rather, Fechner's brain, subjected to an unimaginable 'psychic dissection' for the purposes of a sort of re-creation, an experimental recon- struction, based on impressions (undoubtedly the most durable ones) engraved on his memory" (87). Although the purpose of this "psychic dissection" remains unclear, the mimoid structure clearly preserves an image of the pilot after his own death, revealing film technology's capacity for storing and transmitting information. The mysterious visitors also represent manifestations of psychic information engraved in the Solarists' minds, and the scene where Kelvin is visited by his dead mentor, Gibarian, clearly illustrates Kittler's link between media and mourning. At first Kelvin seems convinced that Gibarian is one of the visitors, whom he refers to as the ocean's "puppets." He then wakes up and hears Gibarian's voice farther away, giving a monologue in which he calls the ocean an "amplifier of our own thoughts"-yet another example of the ocean being compared to a technological medium (134). Kelvin then wakes a second time and wonders if his previous experiences were dreams: "I was not completely sure that it had been a dream" (135). It is after this visitation that Kelvin begins looking for the tape recorder on which Gibarian kept a record of his experiments; later in the novel, Rheya reveals that she has taken the tape recorder and has been listening to it in private while Kelvin sleeps. Gibarian's monologue, which Kelvin overhears in his second "dream," is therefore an actual recording of Gibarian's voice; and this confusion between dreams, ghostly visitations, and technological recordings seems to further emphasize the notion that technological media expand "the realms of the dead." One objection to this reading might be that the mimoids and the visitors are represented as physical, tangible objects, not simply as images. But during the course of the novel it becomes clear that these manifestations have a strange new kind of materiality. When Kelvin places Rheya's blood under a microscope, he discovers that she has no real substance; her body is not composed of visible particles or atoms: "There was nothing to be seen. There should have been the ferment of a quivering cloud of atoms, but I saw nothing. A dazzling light filled the screen, which was flawlessly clear.... What was the meaning of it? Was this body, frail and weak in appearance but indestructible in reality, actually made of nothing?" (98-99). Rheya's body, like a spectral image, seems to be composed of nothing but light itself. And while the ocean's mimoids seem to be made of a milky, ectoplasmic substance, which Kelvin calls "a yeasty colloid" (112), the ocean as a whole seems much like the nineteenth century myth of the</page><page sequence="11">44 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) "etheric ocean" that was supposed to have existed throughout the universe, allowing for the transmission of light waves, electricity, and magnetism through space (see Peters 102). The most significant example of communication with the dead in Solaris is the manifestation of Rheya, Kelvin's dead wife, who clearly represents a supernatural or ghostly figure. Even though ten years have passed since her suicide, Kelvin is still in mourning; he has not remarried, and he continues to blame himself for her death. Rheya's reappearance thus corresponds to Freud's description of the origin of spirits. In his essay "Thoughts for the Times on War and Death" (1915), Freud argues that "[i]t was beside the dead body of someone he loved that [man] invented spirits," because he did not want to acknowledge death as an annihilation (14: 294). Freud adds, however, that "his sense of guilt at the satisfaction mingled with his sorrow turned these new-born spirits into evil demons that had to be dreaded" (14: 294). This combination of satisfaction and guilt is perfectly illustrated in Kelvin's first reaction to Rheya's appearance: he is so disturbed at seeing her, and so concerned about his own sanity, that he immediately launches her into space in a shuttle. After she is gone, Kelvin is relieved; he feels rescued from the possibility that he is going insane: "I felt I was justified in thinking that I had defeated the 'simulacra,' and that behind the illusion, contrary to all expectation, I had found the real Rheya again-the Rheya of my memories, whom the hypothesis of madness would have destroyed" (65). This claim echoes Freud's notion that man's "persisting memory of the dead became the basis for assuming other forms of existence and gave him the conception of a life continuing after apparent death" (14: 294). In other words, the memory of Rheya is comforting to Kelvin because it carries the promise of other forms of existence after death; it feels more like "the real Rheya," while the ocean's manifestation of Rheya appears to be nothing more than an impossible simulacrum that threatens his notion of reality. The manifestation of Rheya soon returns, however, and despite Snow's repeated warnings that she is not a person, Kelvin gradually becomes emotionally attached to her; "the real Rheya" and the "simulacrum" eventually become one and the same. Kelvin's attitude towards Rheya changes so dramatically that by the end of the novel he even rescues her from a suicide attempt, which could be interpreted as a cathartic reenactment of Rheya's original suicide that allows Kelvin to come to terms with the trauma. Rheya's desperate need to be close to him at all times, however, emphasizes the degree to which Kelvin's prolonged mourning is unhealthy. His inability to let go of his dead wife seems to illustrate Freud's idea of the "work of mourning" in "Mourning and Melancholia": Reality-testing has shown that the loved object no longer exists, and it proceeds to demand that all libido shall be withdrawn from its attachments to that object. This demand arouses understandable opposition.... This opposition can be so intense that a turning away from reality takes place and a clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis. Normally, respect for reality gains the day. Nevertheless its orders cannot be obeyed at once. They are</page><page sequence="12">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 45 carried out bit by bit, at great expense of time and cathectic energy, and in the meantime the existence of the lost object is psychically prolonged. (14: 244-245) The work of mourning is the process of coping with the death of a loved one by gradually withdrawing one's attachment; melancholia is an unhealthy reaction in which "the free libido" is "not displaced on to another object" but is "withdrawn into the ego" (249). As a result, melancholia is more absorbing, the patient seems more withdrawn and dejected, and the process seemingly is endless. Kelvin's obsession with Rheya, combined with his gradual withdrawal from his other colleagues, indicates that he is suffering from melancholia. Because Rheya's appearance represents a manifestation of Kelvin's unconscious thoughts and emotions, and because the visitors are repeatedly associated with the technology of film and are described as immaterial filmic projections, it is clear that Kelvin's melancholia is a product of conditions of mediality. Rickels claims that modern culture, unlike primitive cultures, "keeps open lines of communication with the deceased" through communications technologies: media prevent us from bringing the work of mourning to a close (297). He supports this claim by returning to his previous connection between psychoanalysis and phonography: "Freud's disinterment of the phantom voices of the superego ... coincides with the advent of phonographic or radio recording whereby the voice becomeq reproducible and hence, posthumized, just as photography and film project and animate those phantoms which haunt those who are unable to grant the dead proper burial" (297). Phonography and film allow modern culture to keep "open lines of communication with the deceased." Kelvin's prolonged mourning-his inability to successfully displace his libido onto a new love object due to Rheya's repeated manifestations-illustrates Rickels' claim that "media culture conducts that endless work of mourning Freud called melancholia" (297). The representation of an encounter with an alien presence as an encounter with communications technologies is also emphasized in His Master's Voice. In this novel, American scientists attempt to decipher a transmission received from outer space that has been recorded on miles of tape. The original title of the book, Glos pana, can be translated as "The Voice of the Lord," which may be interpreted several ways. The "neutrino letter from the stars" might function as a divine message from the heavens; it might hint at the scientists' fears of the aliens as invaders or "lords" bent on world domination. But it also calls attention to the ways in which the scientists themselves are controlled by the voice of their own "lord"-the Pentagon. Throughout the novel, however, Lem refers to the project using the English title "His Master's Voice," the trademark logo of the Berliner gramophone company, which features a dog listening to a gramophone player who appears confused by the gramophone's simulation of his master's voice. The English title, therefore, is not only a reference to communications technologies but also refers to the problem of distinguishing between real experiences and the effects of technological media. The narrator's opening commentary emphasizes this theme: "A phonograph record of angelic singing is not an iota better morally than one that reproduces, when played, a scream of</page><page sequence="13">46 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) murder" (8). He also adds that "the sound of battle played on a record is not an actual battle" (8). According to the narrator, it is difficult to distinguish between actual events and their reproduction by technological media, but the act of distinguishing between them may carry grave ethical consequences. The metaphors used emphasize that the difficulty the scientists face does not lie in deciphering what the aliens are trying to say-the meaning of their message-so much as in separating the content of the message from its medium. The narrator compares the "neutrino letter from the stars" to a telegram that reads "GRANDMOTHER DEAD FUNERAL WEDNESDAY," noting that an alien would not understand this message: such a communication "assumes that the one who receives the message will know which signs in it carry information and which constitute their unessential background" (74-75). With the letter from the stars, on the other hand, "[t]he recorded rhythm could have represented, for example, only marks of punctuation, while the actual 'letters' or ideograms could have failed completely to affect the surface of the tape's magnetic coating, being impulses to which the machine was not sensitive" (75). Another scientist uses the metaphor of a singer able to shatter glass with his voice: "What the man sings about has no bearing, obviously, on this consequence of his song" (95). The narrator also describes the difficulty of translating the alien signal by comparing it to the act of reading a letter by analyzing its ink: "From a chemical analysis of the ink with which a letter is written to us, we will never deduce the intellectual attributes of the writer" (104). The narrator even suggests that the scientists are attempting the equivalent of placing digital tape intended for a computer into a player piano (145). All these metaphors indicate that the scientists are focusing on the medium of the alien communication, not its meaning; rather than simply interpreting the text, the scientists must become media analysts. Yet they are attempting to analyze a technological medium incompatible with their own, just as digital tape is incompatible with a player piano. The scientists are sure that the neutrino letter is not a naturally occurring phenomenon, because it is constantly repeated. Its structure is circular, with no clear beginning and end-a structure replicated in the organization of the novel itself. The novel is a fictional account of the "His Master's Voice" project written by a mathematician named Peter Hogarth, and it opens with a note from a fictitious editor who explains that Hogarth has died and that the novel has been found among his papers. The editor goes onto explain that Hogarth left a "fragment" behind which "was to have served ... as either a preface or an afterword to the book" (1). The editor adds that he has chosen to place it at the beginning. This arbitrary choice introduces a level of indeterminacy into the very structure of the novel, which itself has no clear beginning or conclusion; the placement of the fragment connects the two ends of the novel into a loop that could be infinitely repeated. The uncertainty emphasized in the novel's structure recapitulates the problems posed by the neutrino letter itself, once again emphasizing the significance of media in the act of reading. The obvious difference is that the novel is a work of literature: like the scientists in Solaris,</page><page sequence="14">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 47 Hogarth is shown as being dependent on print technology, unable to bridge the gap between print and more modem forms of technological media. Near the end of the novel, Hogarth admits that he is unable to watch television: "I tried watching television, but everything on it seemed to me unutterably phony and devoid of sense, the news programs included" (153). The scientists' failure to decipher the letter from the stars seems analogous to Hogarth's failure to understand the television. In other words, the "sense" of the alien letter remains inscrutable because scientists are unable to understand the signal's medium: their failure can be seen as a failure to adapt to a changing media ecology. The separation of the signal as an artifact from its mysterious "senders" is emphasized by the fact that it is being transmitted from many light years away. The scientists can only assume that the aliens who originally sent it are already long since dead. Although His Master's Voice is not a ghost story in the style of Solaris, this notion of a communication from the dead is repeated when the scientists learn that the Pentagon has assembled a second shadow group, "His Master's Ghost," also assigned the task of deciphering the message. When the two groups are finally brought together, the scientists in "His Master's Ghost" reveal that they have been working on the assumption that there was potentially no original sender at all and that the message could simply be the echo of a dying universe (181). It is possible that the alien signal is not simply a commun- ication from a race of dead aliens: it may also be a phantasmatic, ghostly voice from the realms beyond. This suggestion is of course echoed in the second group's name, "His Master's Ghost," which not only suggests that the group is a shadow or "ghost" of Hogarth's original group, but also revises the Berliner gramophone logo: the technological recording of the "master's voice" on the gramophone might also be interpreted as having a ghostly presence. When considered in this light, Hogarth's comparison of the alien signal to a telegraphic death notice takes on a potentially greater significance: the message appears to be a form of technological media that has preserved some trace of the dead. The idea of communicating with the dead is also replicated in the frame of the novel. Because Hogarth's account of the "His Master's Voice" project is published posthumously, it too may be read as a communication from "the realms of the dead." It also contains several long meditations on death and mortality, including descriptions of Hogarth's earliest memories of mourning and the suffering he has witnessed during his life. At first glance, it seems difficult to reconcile these meditations on death with the plot of the novel, but the combination of these two narrative strands clearly indicates that the novel is addressing the relationship between mediality and mourning. In contrast to the letter from the stars, which functions as a form of technological media that preserves traces of the dead, Hogarth's literary meditations on death repeatedly emphasize the notion that the dead should be laid to rest. In other words, rather than conducting "that endless work of mourning Freud called melancholia," Hogarth seems to call for a return to print technologies, which allow for the work of mourning to be carried to its completion. Hogarth's meditations on death mainly focus on his memories of his mother's</page><page sequence="15">48 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) death and an account of a colleague's experiences during the Holocaust. In the first story, Hogarth remembers his strange reaction to his mother's illness when he was nine years old: I loved her, yet at the same time I followed with an unusually keen and avid attention the process of her destruction ... when I left her, as soon as I had shut the door behind me and found myself alone, I stuck out my tongue joyfully in the direction of her bed, and, that being insufficient, ran to my room and breathlessly jumped up and down in front of the mirror, fists clenched, making faces and giggling with delight. (8-9) Hogarth then offers an explanation for his odd behavior: "My hidden laughter had no connection with the actual suffering of my mother. I only feared that suffering.... I had only one choice: either to be destroyed with her or to jeer at her. As a coward, then, I chose the laughter of betrayal" (9). Rodnianskaia argues that Hogarth behaved this way as a child because, unlike an adult, he could not "'ward off,' rationalize, and sanctify death" (357). It is only as a child that Hogarth is actually able to mourn, and this illustrates Freud's description of the work of mourning; Hogarth even feels guilty because he perceives the withdrawing of his libidinal attachments to his dying mother as an act of betrayal. The tendency of the adult Hogarth to "rationalize" death explains the coldness with which he describes the deaths of many of his former colleagues. For example, when discussing the death of Maxwell Thorpe, a young anthropologist with whom he collaborated, Hogarth says merely that "he later died tragically in an automobile accident" (23). And when describing the death of his colleague Donald Prothero, Hogarth oddly states that "[h]e suffered a statistical deviation in the stream of cellular divisions: cancer" (198). At the end of the novel, Hogarth reflects on his scientific detachment: "What do I know of the secret fears, ideas, and hopes of those who were my colleagues for a time? I was never able to conquer the distance between persons.... [W]e are only able, imperfectly, darkly, to visualize ourselves" (198-199). In other words, Hogarth eventually becomes convinced that human experiences are fundamentally "nontransmittable"; the only experiences of suffering he can truly understand are his own. Hogarth's notion that human experience is essentially nontransmittable is a good illustration of Heidegger's claim that " [clommunication is never anything like a conveying of experiences ... from the inside of one subject to the inside of another" (Being and Time 162). Heidegger refers to forms of public discourse, including forms of technological media, such as the radio, as "idle talk," which actually hinders the subject's understanding of its own experiences: "[W]hen Da-sein maintains itself in idle talk, it is-as being-in-the-world-cut off from the primary and primordially genuine relations of being toward the world, toward Mitda-sein, toward being-in itself" (170). Heidegger also adds that people are unable to actually experience the suffering and death of others: [T]he real having-come-to-an-end of the deceased is precisely not experienced. Death does reveal itself as a loss, but as a loss experienced by those remaining behind. However, in suffering the loss, the loss of being as such which the dying</page><page sequence="16">MEDIALITY AND MOURNING IN LEM 49 person "suffers" does not become accessible. We do not experience the dying of others in a genuine sense; we are at best always just "there" too. (222) Despite the fact that the subject is unable to experience the death of others, however, Heidegger argues that encountering the death of an other is one way for the subject to understand its own "authentic" being, because "[Ajuthentic being-toward-death cannot evade its own most non-relational possibility or cover it over in this flight and reinterpret it for the common sense of the they" (260). Although human experience is non-transmittable, encountering the death and suffering of others allows the subject to understand its own experience. Yet modem communications technologies hinder this understanding by inhibiting self-reflection. Elsewhere, Heidegger adds that "the self-assertion of techno- logical objectification is the constant negation of death" (Poetry, Language, Thought 125). Thus, mourning becomes a central issue in discussing the function of technology, which Avital Ronell refers to as "a monument to an impossible mourning" (340). According to Ronell, technological objectification negates death, and therefore hinders the process of mourning. Ronell adds that when mourning is inhibited, it "causes the lost 'love object' to be preserved in a crypt like a mummy, maintained as the binding around what is not there" (341). According to Ronell, therefore, technology becomes a crypt that contains the dead but prevents the bereaved from grieving. Hogarth's notion that human experience is non-transmittable is first stated early in the novel, when Dr. Rappaport recounts a brush with death during the Holocaust. While waiting for what he thinks will be his execution, Rappaport irrationally convinces himself that after he dies his life will be transferred into the body of a Nazi guard who stands nearby. Hogarth recounts that Rappaport "knew perfectly well that the idea was complete nonsense ... [b]ut somehow this did not bother him; in fact, the longer and more greedily he stared at the chosen man, the better he was able to cling to this thought that was to sustain him until the final moment" (63). The impossibility of the imagined psychic transfer, which Rappaport uses to conceal the reality of his own impending death from himself, illustrates the fantasy of "pure" communication as the transfer of thoughts from one mind to another. As in Solaris, this imagined psychic or telepathic transfer is particularly relevant because it highlights the connections between supernatural conceptions of communication and the promise of technological media represented by the alien signal, which also transfers life in the form of a "biophilic" effect. Nonetheless, by the end of the novel Hogarth seems convinced that our failure to communicate and understand one another's suffering is actually beneficial: The fact that human anguish, fear, and suffering melt away with the death of the individual, that nothing remains of the ascents, the declines, the orgasms, and the agonies, is a praiseworthy gift of evolution.... If from every unfortunate, from every victim, there remained even a single atom of his feelings, if thus grew the inheritance of the generations, if even a spark could pass from man to man, the world would be full of raw, bowel-torn howling. (199) Rodnianskaia is correct in drawing a connection between death and chance in Lem's novel, but in the end her formulation does not explain the paradox of</page><page sequence="17">50 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) Hogarth's final statements, which express optimism about the alien signal while at the same time yearning for death. Rodnianskaia notes that the people for whom Hogarth mourns, such as his mother and his old colleagues and rivals, "are all ghosts of Hogarth's memory" who "live in a dimension different from that of the alien signal, where there is hope for the survival of life in the universe" (357-58). This statement echoes Kelvin's claim that "the real Rheya" is the Rheya in his memory, rather than the "simulacrum" sent to him by the ocean. In both cases, memory is clearly separate from consciousness, but technological media are shown as having the effect of perceiving, recording, and transmitting these unconscious thoughts and emotions into the real world, multiplying spectral voices and images of the deceased. This relationship between mediality and mourning reveals an essential connection between the dimension of ghosts and alien communication. Hogarth's mixed optimism about alien communication at the end of His Master's Voice echoes Kelvin's hesitant faith at the end of Solaris. In the closing scene of the latter novel, Kelvin compares life to a phonograph record: "That human existence should repeat itself, well and good, but that it should repeat itself like a hackneyed tune, or a record a drunkard keeps playing as he feeds coins into the jukebox...." (204). Although he doubts that real communication with the ocean will ever be possible, he remains convinced that further contact will be made: "I lived in expectation.... I did not know what achievements, what mockery, even what tortures still awaited me. I knew nothing, and I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past" (204). Like Kelvin, Hogarth hopes that a reply to the letter might be possible, but he also remains skeptical that actual communication with the alien will ever occur. At the end of His Master's Voice, Hogarth reveals that the ultimate benefit of death is that people are finally free of the endless work of mourning, the endless replaying of the phonograph record. In the end, only death itself is capable of erasing human suffering, and in both novels the metaphor of alien communication is employed to illustrate the degree to which technological media actually prolong the work of mourning by translating the dead into spectral images-voices that testify endlessly, across vast distances of space and time, to their own suffering.

ABSTRACT This essay examines the representation of communication technologies in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris and His Master's Voice. Following John Johnston's definition of "mediality" as "the ways in which a literary text inscribes in its own language the effects</page><page sequence="19">52 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 29 (2002) produced by other media" (175), I argue that Lem employs the scenario of alien contact in these novels in order to represent the effects produced by competing media technologies. By metaphorically presenting these technologies as apparently sentient alien beings, Lem illustrates the notion that new technologies shape and determine consciousness by perceiving, recording, and storing information which was previously unrepresentable and which therefore belonged to the realm of the unconscious. Solaris and His Master's Voice ultimately reveal the ways in which new media technologies, such as phonography and film, influence human consciousness by prolonging the work of mourning through the preservation of voices and images of the dead.</page></plain_text>
