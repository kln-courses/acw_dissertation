<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ted Dadswell,T£&lt;? Selborne Pioneer, Gilbert White as a Naturalist and Scientist: A Re examination, Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2002, xix + 238 pp., illus., £89.95. Gilbert White is one of the celebrated figures in the history of natural history. Yet, as Ted Dadswell correctly states in his new biography of White, much remains obscure about his work. Indeed, Dadswell claims there is a fair amount of mythology associated with White and one of his goals in this modest book is to set the record straight. Curiously, however, the major source for DadswelFs mythological concerns is a broadcaster by the name of Stefan Buczacki, who claimed in 1984 that 'old naturalist Gilbert White hated earthworms and wanted to get rid of them . . . ' (page xi). The reader is never informed as to whether Buczacki set off a major controversy among White afficionados or whether White's reputation had been tarnished as a result of this libelous claim, but it does represent the sole source of myth against which Dadswell must contend. At the book's conclusion, however, the reader is not reminded of any corrective, instead the author concludes: Ί have discussed him [White] almost as if he were a twentieth century figure. But I have not meant by this that he can be annexed to the twentieth century' (page 169). Hence, the reader has been presented with a challenge by the author. Did White really hate worms or was he a twentieth century figure living before his time? The Selborne Pioneer is an intriguing book. Most students of the history of natural history know of Gilbert White and his work at Selborne. However, this intrigue is soon lost once the book is opened. There is plenty of information about White, but it is so poorly organized that it reads like a book representing a parody of history; that is, it is one damn thing after the other. Furthermore, when Dadswell does present an interesting aspect of White's career - for example, his close relationship with the Newtonian, Stephen Hales - he quickly moves on to a more obscure topic. Finally, there are gratuitous</page><page sequence="2">426 BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 26 (2004), 407-465 statements that add to the puzzlement. 'No animal is an island, for White' page 52. 'White was a bachelor, but he showed no willingness to impose celibacy on other creatures' (page 78). Since the author does not do anything else with these statements, the reader is left perplexed. Are these jokes or serious comments? Perhaps the central problem of The Selborne Pioneer is the lack of an historical context. The author repeats his claim throughout to place White in proper historical and cultural context, but he does not offer either in the text. Instead, he wonders why there was a lack of controls in eighteenth-century British science (page 30). He discusses the lack of anthropomorphism in White's observations on animal behavior, and then uses examples that demonstrate overt anthropomorphism. He notes White's work in meteorology, centuries before the science was developed and without reference to the importance of weather observations in natural history. He refers to White's work in natural history as bringing him 'close to evolution theory' because of his reliance on adaptation while, at the same time, depicting White as a believer in Design arguments. A final example of the anachronistic problems with Dadswell's work is in relationship to White's work on fossils. The author states that White was not able to make any link between fossils and geological strata because he 'knew little or nothing about geological time' (page 121). Dadswell continues immediately to suggest that 'he would have recognized the challenge to Design the fossil material represented' (page 123) and then concluded that 'he emphasizes the time dimension' (page 125). It is hard to know which historical context in which White is being depicted, but it is not the eighteenth century. In brief, there is little to commend in The Shelborne Pioneer. Certainly, there is great need for another examination of the life and work of Gilbert White. But beyond correcting the broadcaster's claim about White's view of earthworms - while he claimed they represented a 'despicable link in the chain of Nature,' their absence would also make a 'lamentable chasm' in the chain (page 21) - Dadswell does not add much to what is known about this remarkable naturalist.
