<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science and Religion* By SHIELEY JACKSON CASE Chicago, 111. ' Ι ΉΕ Christian college is distinctively a feature of the American ·*&gt; scene. It is one of the early byproducts of immigration's westward movement from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In each newly settled territory, after homes had been built and houses of worship erected, attention was given to the problem of education. School boards were appointed, school houses were constructed, and a school master was engaged to instruct the youth in the elements of learning. Thus the foundations were laid for a continuing civilization. Private academies and colleges represent a second stage in the development of educational activity on the frontier. The incen- tive for their founding was more distinctly a concern for the wel- fare of religion. The pioneer missionary had assembled worship- ing congregations in various localities and then moved on to effect a similar work in new areas, leaving the local churches without clerical supervision. Appeals for ministerial leaders from the east were but scantily heeded, and presently it dawned upon the con- sciousness of the people that they must provide local facilities for educating young men of their own communities to serve their churches. This was the primary motive that led to the founding of the Christian college. Each new expansion of the frontier re- sulted in the planting of these educational establishments by one or another Christian communion, until at present there are hun- dreds of these schools dotting the country from east to west and north to south. We may too easily forget the immense service rendered to the cultural and religious life of America by these pioneer colleges. This f orgetfulness is due in large measure to the rapid seculariza- tion of education that has been going on in recent years. The public high school has almost completely overshadowed the private academy, many communities now support a local junior college, * Bedell Lecture delivered on Founders ' Day, November 1, 1938, at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio. [ 255 1</page><page sequence="2">Christian Education and great state universities, especially in the middle and far west, tend to dominate the educational landscape. And even the Christian colleges have become so thoroughly secularized that instruction in religion appears but scantily, if at all, in their curricula. The sponsors of these secular developments seem to have little or no awareness of the fact that they are building upon founda- tions laid by the church. They do not appreciate their debt to its initiative and energy in giving to educational interests the large place which they hold today in American life. Of these moderns it might be said, as Plato said of his pupil Aristotle, that he was like a colt that sucked its mother dry and then wheeled round and kicked her. As a matter of course, the founders of the Christian college a century ago worked from the postulates of religion as these were current in their day. Inevitably they phrased their ideas in the terminology of the time. The ideology of the frontier was always conservative, even when its activities were novel and unique. Let me cite an illustration. A hundred and ten years ago the school board of a certain town in southern Ohio delivered itself of a memorable pronouncement. Some forward-looking people had asked permission to use the schoolhouse for a meeting to discuss the question as to whether or not railroads were practical. The reply made by the dignified guardians of the public intelligence read thus : ťť You are welcome to use the schoolhouse to debate all proper questions in, but such things as railroads and telegraphs are im- possibilities and rank infidelity. There is nothing in the Word of God about them. If God had designed that his intelligent crea- tures should travel at the frightful speed of fifteen miles an hour, by steam, he would have clearly foretold it through his holy proph- ets. It is a device of Satan to lead immortal souls down to hell. ' ' If the city fathers of that once frontier Ohio community were to resume office today they might very well be presented with the same request. Likely enough certain persons might wish again to discuss the question of whether railroads are practical. But the live issue now would be, not whether railroads ought to be adopted as a prospective means of transportation, but whether they have not outlived their usefulness. The private motor car, the motor [256]</page><page sequence="3">Science and Religion bus and truck, and the airplane furnish a service preferable in many respects to that of the railroads. And other objections to them might be raised. They consume vast amounts of the country 's fuel supply, they divert from cultivation valuable acres of land, they deface the landscape and defile the atmosphere. Ought they not to be abolished for the good of mankind? Another half- century in the evolution of transportation may decree their demise. What tremendous changes have been wrought in our ideas about speed and distance within a single century ! Changes in educational thinking have been equally radical. The Christian college originally constructed its curriculum around two foci. These were, first, revealed wisdom as mediated through the Bible and the church, and, second, humanistic studies in lan- guage, literature and philosophy. But gradually a new center of interest has been pushing itself into the foreground. It flourishes today under the familiar term "science." Some of us can still remember how hesitantly and cautiously geology and astronomy were admitted into our college course of instruction, lest they undermine our trust in the accuracy of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis or disturb our beliefs about the physical location of the heavenly abodes wherein dwelt the souls of the blessed dea,d. But during the last half-century this earlier aloofness toward sci- ence has quite disappeared. Courses in the physical, biological and social sciences bulk large in the curricula of all Christian col- leges that make any prétentions to intellectual respectability, while humanistic studies are compelled to proselyte for disciples, and religious subjects lurk uncertainly about the outskirts of academic learning. In this course of development have the Christian colleges be- trayed the trust committed to them by their founders a century ago ? They were all established to advance the cause of religion, and it might well seem to the casual observer that today they have sold their high birthright for a mess of scientific pottage. Personally, I do not believe this condemnatory judgment to be correct. The oft-repeated assertion that there is an irreconcilable antithesis between science and religion is a premature conclusion deduced from a very peripheral comprehension of the genius of these respective subjects. Even at the risk of seeming too dogmat- [257]</page><page sequence="4">Christian Education ically brief in my definitions, I would regard science as ultimately a quest for knowledge of nature, while religion is essentially a quest for knowledge of God. Religion's task is, by its very premises, incapable of complete accomplishment. It seeks to know a God who is believed to trans- cend the bounds of human knowledge. It adores as creator and sustainer of the universe a being whom it has never seen and whose form is thought inaccessible to human eyes. It strives to effect communion between finite creatures and God, while at the same time declaring him to be an incomprehensibly infinite spirit. It would shape human conduct and thinking in accordance with a divine pattern the full measure of which it declares itself incapable of apprehending. It preaches that men should be perfect as the Father in heaven is perfect, and yet affirms that the Supreme Deity alone can be truly holy, righteous and good. In short, relig- ion is always concerned with imponderables beyond whose portals it ever vainly strives to pass. But the obverse side of the coin is equally real. Here the im- ponderables give place to concrete data of human life and think- ing. Religion proposes to tell all people just what they should believe and how they should act. It is assumed that on the mun- dane level men are responsible for working out their own salvation with fear and trembling, availing themselves of all attainable knowledge and responding to the highest impulses of which they are capable. Hence there is a mighty urge within religion to specify allegedly valid doctrines, to formulate binding ethical codes, and to prescribe rules and ceremonies for correct ecclesiasti- cal procedure. Thus religion engenders theolog " У ich is a concrete statement of opinions about the origin and constitution of the universe, a definition of the nature, mission and destiny of man, an interpre- tation of the Deity's dealings with mortals, a program for their conduct toward their fellow-creatures and toward God, and elabo- rate instructions for the direction of all activities that are thought to count for righteousness. Theologians have never abandoned all awareness of the imponderables, but they have generally ventured unhesitatingly to affirm final knowledge about concrete phenomena not convince the boy that his fears were unnecessary. When this [ 258 ]</page><page sequence="5">Science and Beligion sought to fortify these opinions by assuming that they accurately reflect the very mind of God. Thus they have commonly supposed that in the last analysis they have spoken by the authority of divine revelation. Now Christian theology is a comparatively ancient discipline, whose statements about man and nature were phrased in terms of a view of the world prevalent long centuries before science had begun its distinctive quest for knowledge of natural phenomena. Theology had preempted every area of opinion long before Galileo, Kepler, Newton and their more modern successors in the field of scientific research had appeared upon the scene. It was inevitable that there should be a long and bitter struggle between traditional theology and the new science. The story of this conflict down to within half a century ago has been adequately recounted by Andrew D. White in his two well known volumes on that subject forty odd years ago. Since that date the conflict has grown less acute, but the victory of science has become continually more evident. Today all religious people who lay any claim to culture and intel- ligence accept without question the findings of physical science. They can no longer believe that the earth and man were created during the third week of October in the year 4004 B.C., as Bishop Ussher had affirmed on the basis of Old Testament chronology worked out by him some three hundred years ago. We now know that the earth, with its fauna and flora, has experienced a gradual process of becoming through long millennia. The biological sciences trace the genesis of human life far beyond the biblical story of Adam. And the social sciences have dis- covered that moral codes, K ^al regimes, and all the intricate re- lationships in which people nave thus far lived together on earth, conform to no superimposed divine laws but have evolved under the influence of specific environments and out of elemental urges within the life of individuals and groups. The quest of science for natural knowledge of earth and sky, for knowledge of man and his life upon the planet, and for an understanding of his mental processes and cultural history, makes an imperious claim to the right of way in modern thinking. The quest of religion for knowledge of God is not in the least [ 259 ]</page><page sequence="6">Christian Education impaired, and may in fact be distinctly advanced, by modern scien- tific methods and findings. Of course, one must not make religion identical with some specific form of theological dogma that has been formulated in past ages. The young men of a generation ago used all too readily to make this mistake. In their first zest for the truth of science they felt impelled to abandon certain Christian dogmas that had been taught them in their childhood, and they forthwith inferred that religion was consequently null and void. They identified religion with its theological byproduct of an earlier century and thought the essence entirely lost, when as a matter of fact its only offense was that it came to them clothed in outmoded garments of antiquity. But impatiently they dismissed it without taking the trouble to seek for it new and more modern vestments. There is, I think, or at least I hope, less precipitancy among the youth of today in dismissing from their attention the claims of religion. While science has discredited some of the older forms of theological definition, it has at the same time provided a vaster perspective and a surer footing from which to approach the peren- nial concerns of religion. The awesome reverence with which the ancient Psalmist saw in the heavens a display of God's glory and a manifestation of his handiwork is certainly not diminished by the majesty of that limitless star-spangled expanse of infinity revealed by the modern telescope. Religion's quest for God is not denied, but is only magnified, by this new experience, except for one whose spirit is so overwhelmed by immensity that he refuses to venture by faith into the regions of the great beyond. It is said that Laplace once remarked that he had swept the heavens with his telescope and had found no God, to which one of his religious critics replied that he might have swept the kitchen with a broom and had the same result. Religion calls for the outreach of the human spirit into the unfathomable depths of the cosmos. If one refuses this venture he can hardly share the uplift of him who, though compelled to turn back from his thwarted quest, is still able to perceive the glory of God in the new heavens spread out before us by the discoveries of modern astronomy. Science has not removed the imponderables from religion ; it has only increased their immensity. Science has also given us an orderly universe. Specific events [ 260 ]</page><page sequence="7">Science and Keligion are linked together in an all-pervading causal nexus. We have learned to speak of the inexorableness of natural laws. Belief in miraculous happenings accomplished by the arbitrary intervention of Deity to thwart or divert nature's normal processes is no longer agreeable to our ways of thinking. But to discredit ancient faith in the miraculous does not, as used to be supposed, really cut the tap-root of religion. A God who occasionally strides through the universe upsetting the orderly processes of which he is the author and sustainer would seem to us a self -contradictory being. On the contrary, we would read his will more truly than we have ever done before by the knowledge which science has given us of the universal laws that permeate the cosmos. This does not mean that we abandon our faith in Providence or cease our yearning for divine guidance in daily living. In reality this faith is heightened and our sense of human responsibility for acquiring better knowledge of God's will is enhanced by this new awareness of the divine presence within nature and man. Provi- dence becomes both divine and human. We now learn that God has chosen to work through the instrumentality of men. We mar- vel at his patience in waiting for men to arise to these nobler heights of comprehension and attainment. It is a mistake to sup- pose that when they emerge Deity has added some new increment to his creative work. The lightnings sported in the heavens from the dawn of time but remained unavailable for human welfare until a man arose to lay hold of them with Promethean cunning, to harness them to our machines, to make them light our dwellings, and to turn them into vocal messengers for carrying our thoughts around the globe. Elated by their own temporary accomplish- ments, men may momentarily forget their relations with the Deity, but it ever remains the task and privilege of religion to learn more about God as he works through these natural channels to reveal himself to his creatures. In the realm of moral spiritual ideals, it is often alleged that science and religion have nothing in common. We have time and again been told, by men whose names stand high in the roster of scholars within each of these fields, that here are two areas of ac- tivity that should never be allowed to overlap. But the tenability of this opinion is certainly open to question. The perplexing [261]</page><page sequence="8">Christian Education presence of both good and evil in the world, and the struggle waged between them in the thinking and actions of the individual and of society, are data with which the sciences of psychology and sociology are necessarily concerned. And any form of cultural quest that does not take full account of the sins of mankind, and does not aim at their suppression and elimination, is unworthy of the name of either science or religion. Science teaches us that the problem of evil has heretofore been too lightly regarded by religion. This does not mean that religion has been disposed to wink tolerantly at sin, but rather that it has failed to appreciate the intricate natural causes that have engen- dered and perpetuated human frailty. We used to be content to think that all evil was traceable to an Adamic taint stamped upon the race of mankind by its first progenitor's disobedience to a dietary rule imposed upon him by God. To eliminate evil we needed only to nullify the effects of Adam's fall. But science has set the whole problem in a new framework and rendered its solu- tion much more difficult of accomplishment. Now we know that the natural impulses of man stem from a brutish ancestry, and religion faces the truly Herculean task of making moral and spiri- tual ideals flower above a beastly strain of savage blood inherited perhaps from a Neanderthal man. The knowledge that science has gathered about the working of elemental impulses in men individually and collectively, the physi- cal and social conditions that stimulate or retard ethical behavior, and the techniques that may be most effectively employed for the amelioration of distress and the building of character, all of this is grist for religion's mill. Believing that it is commissioned to do God's work in the world, it cannot ignore as irrelevantly secular any knowledge or device that has to do with the cure of souls. These strategems may at first seem to be only artifices of men, but by their remedial efficacy for the moral and spiritual betterment of the world they attest their divine authentication. In the last analysis is there not, however, one citadel of religion that remains forever closed to the prying eye of science ? Can it explore the inner sanctuary of the human spirit where men and God communicate with one another in the secret chambers of the soul ? But even these sacred precincts have occasionally been pro- [ 262 ]</page><page sequence="9">Science and Religion faned by the researches of science. The scientist would peer into the psychology of conversion. He would analyse the physical stimuli of fasting, prolonged prayer and silent meditation that attended the unique religious experiences of the great mystics of the church. And he would evaluate the significance of music and art and ritual in lending solemnity and effectiveness to the rites of religious worship. At all of this religion has no cause to take offense. It might better welcome the fullest understanding of all the physical, psy- chological and social phenomena that attend, or can be made to contribute toward, the attainment of the richest and noblest type of religious experience. We should gladly cherish and intelli- gently employ every available means by which the spirit of God and the spirit of man may enter into blessed communion with one an- other. These are ways by which the divine voice speaks to the ear of the human soul, and to apprehend them intelligently is to acquire a fuller knowledge of God. The skeptic has said that the only God we know is the God we make. Inverting a biblical phrase, one declares that men have made gods in their own image. This may be very true of certain pictures of Deity that men have set up for the admiration of their fellows. Xenophanes, an ancient Greek philosopher, quite perti- nently remarked that oxen, horses and lions, if they had hands and could carve images, would represent gods in the form of oxen and horses and lions. But Xenophanes was only protesting against that crude anthropomorphism which is offensive to every intelli- gent person who feels with the Greek sage that God is more truly depicted as "all sight, all mind, all ear, and without effort rules everything by thought." We would know God by thinking his thoughts after him as his mind is revealed in the world of reality where we live, move and have our being. In the last resort it would be more correct to say that the only God we make is the God we know. He will be a creature of distorted proportions if our knowledge of him is limited by narrow observations of nature, by failure to appreciate the depth and richness of human aspirations, and by disregard of the still, small voice that whispers its inspira- tions to the sensitive spirits of prophets and saints. Thus religion ever strives for a knowledge of God. It reaches [263]</page><page sequence="10">Christian Education out in faith toward the magnificent tremendum that lies beyond the ken of telescope and microscope, revering the mysterious power which generates and sustains the physical world and its life. Re- ligion pursues the ways of God as he permeates the universe by the inexorable laws of nature. It reads the story of his providential concern for human affairs in the life and work of mortals who have struggled nobly to comprehend and control the rich resources of the world. And in the human quest for moral and spiritual ideals that ever surge up within the spirit of mankind it recognizes the voice of Deity speaking in divine accents to the souls of men. Science can never be the enemy, but only the humble handmaid, of the type of religion that appropriates to its purposes the scien- tific organization of knowledge in every sphere of intellectual en- deavor. Nothing that is now known or ever can be known in the realm of natural knowledge is impertinent or prejudicial to relig- ion. It lives in the confidence that as knowledge grows from more to more, more of reverence shall in us dwell. [264]</page></plain_text>
