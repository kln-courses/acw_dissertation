<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID F. MIDGLEY* The author extends the research on consumer prepurchase information seeking to a product which is essentially socially symbolic rather than utilitarian. A survey of the purchasers of a fashion item was undertaken, and the data subjected to a novel cluster analytic technique. Several distinct patterns of overt search were de- rived and related to socioeconomic segments of individuals. The author concludes that to explain consumer information seeking it is necessary to gain a better un- derstanding of both the motives underlying search and the risks inherent in any purchase. Patterns of Interpersonal Information Seeking for the Purchase of a Symbolic Product The idea that consumers may undertake external (o- vert) search for information prior to a purchase decision has been widely popularized by conceptual models such as those of Howard and Sheth (1969) and Engel, Kollat, and Blackwell (1973). These models imbue the concept of search with certain connotations of a systematic ap- proach to decision making, utilizing a variety of infor- mation sources and with clear evaluative criteria. How- ever, extensive reviews of the conceptual and empirical literature such as those by Granbois (1977) and Newman (1977) indicate that at best such external search should be characterized as limited rather than extensive. That is, many individuals do not visit more than one retail outlet, and many appear to rely on a small subset of all available information sources (personal, neutral, and ad- vertising). If the typical consumer is involved in limited external search, an interesting question is whether certain pat- terns of source usage can be identified. This question is of interest not only theoretically, but also in terms of designing improved marketing communication pro- grams. The identification of such patterns could poten- tially assist retailers, marketers, and public agencies. Little empirical evidence is available, but at least two studies are worthy of note. *David F.

Claxton, Fry, and Portis (1974) sought to establish a taxonomy of information-gathering patterns for a sample of housewives who had bought a major durable product in the 24 months prior to their survey. Basically their analysis indicated three major groups having distinct patterns of information gathering. One group was a small cluster labeled "thorough (store intense)" who exhibited a fairly extensive search process. A second and larger cluster labeled "thorough (balanced)" perhaps typifies limited search behaviour. The third (also sub- stantial) cluster was thought to be individuals who ex- emplified "a fairly careless approach to shopping" (p. 39). Subsequently Westbrook and Fornell (1979) built on this work to "determine whether patterns of infor- mation source usage could be identified and related to selected explanatory variables" (p. 304). Their analysis defined four roughly equal clusters: objective shopper, store intense shopper, personal advice seeker, and mod- erate shopper. Such evidence is at least partially responsible for the recent debate on the value of current consumer decision- making models (Kassarjian 1978). One pertinent criti- cism of such models is that they "often overlook dif- ferences in the cognitive and motivational patterns as- sociated with the many products and services involved in consumption" (Olshavsky and Granbois 1979, p. 96). The latter critics make a sharp distinction between he- donic, symbolic, and functional products, a typology derived from Woods (1960). They assert that the search- based choice process may be more relevant for func- tional products, and that hedonic and symbolic products may be chosen as a result of very different mechanisms. 74 Journal of Marketing Research Vol. XX (February 1983), 74-83</page><page sequence="2">INTERPERSONAL INFORMATION SEEKING In particular, Olshavsky and Granbois thought that the processes of childhood socialization, conformity to group norms, salesperson recommendation, and word of mouth had been substantially overlooked in the litera- ture. Most information-search studies have been concerned with major durable products, which are perhaps primar- ily functional though some may have symbolic (ego-in- volving) aspects as well. There appears to be an urgent need to extend our studies of external search to hedonic and symbolic products. Only if it were difficult to detect external search for such products would it be more ap- propriate to contemplate new choice models. Though some researchers have collected data on the use of interpersonal sources during external search, most have tended to employ simple questions which may not have yielded an adequate indication of the relative in- fluence of various sources (peers, spouse, salesperson, etc.), and which were not developed from the literature on social comparison, informal group influence, and joint decision making. This literature is not extensive, but it contains some useful insights. For example, Ven- katesan (1966) concluded that in the absence of objective standards for judging a product, group pressure can be an important influence on an individual's choice. Witt and Bruce (1972) demonstrated that the degree of influ- ence depended not only on the nature of the product, but also on such factors as the "perceived expertise" of other group members and the "perceived conspicuous- ness" of brand choice. More recently Moschis (1976) has sought to explain such phenomena in terms of an extension of Festinger's theory of social comparison. According to this extension individuals can compare their behavior with that of their reference group by two basic processes, verbal interaction with a peer and/or the more passive observation of the other's behavior. As well as the influence of "peers," it may be necessary to take account of the roles of spouses. Several studies have demonstrated that some decisions are made jointly, and that issues such as marital power structures and role specialization/sharing are important (e.g., Filiatrault and Ritchie 1980). The issue of the risk inherent in any purchase also warrants the attention of researchers in this area. Not only is the consumer's perception of risk a possible stim- ulus to external information search, but presumably the nature of this risk may differ between functional, he- donic, and symbolic products. All might involve finan- cial risk, but performance risk may be relatively more important for functional products, psychological risk may be relatively more important for hedonic products, and social risk may be relatively more important for symbolic products. Furthermore, within a product class the degree of risk associated with various items may differ widely (e.g., microwave versus ordinary oven). Finally, it is appropriate to comment on the methods used in previous research. Basically the literature indi- cates a gradual evolution from relatively simple analyt- ical techniques toward methods which identify individ- uals' patterns of information seeking across several sources. However, to date these identified patterns have then been related to exogenous individual characteristics (demographic, socioeconomic, etc.) primarily in a sim- ple univariate manner (Claxton, Fry, and Portis 1974, p. 40-1; Westbrook and Fornell 1979, p. 310). It would be valuable to contrast discrete types of individuals (as identified from an appropriate set of variables) with dif- ferent patterns of information search. The results would be readily interpretable, and the method has much in common with the segmentation approaches widely es- poused by marketing practitioners. The objectives of the research reported here are there- fore to: 1. Extend the search literature to symbolic products. 2. Incorporate more detailed measures of interpersonal in- fluence. 3. Recognize the role of risk. 4. Develop current methodological trends. A working paper providing more detailed conceptual and technical discussion is available (Midgley 1981) and only the major points are presented here. HYPOTHESES Men's clothing, specifically the (major) purchase of a suit, was chosen as the research vehicle. A suit is a product (1) whose meaning is primarily symbolic (Flugel 1930; Klapp 1969), (2) whose purchase may involve discussion with co-oriented peers (Myers and Robertson 1972), and (3) for which the major available choices (styles) can be at different stages in their (fashion) life cycles (Brenninkmeyer 1963) and therefore of different degrees of social risk to various individuals. In terms of the patterns of information seeking which might be exhibited in the purchase of such a symbolic product, the preceding discussion would lead one to ex- pect groups of individuals who exhibit little or no ex- ternal information search, or rely on interpersonal ad- vice, or rely on visiting a large number of retail outlets. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that the interpersonal advice segment might well be subdivided to yield peer- assisted and spouse-assisted patterns. In contrast to Westbrook and Fornell's notion, one would not expect an objective shopper (1979, p. 308) as symbolic prod- ucts do not lend themselves to an objective evaluation, nor are neutral sources generally accessible in such mar- kets. The actual search characteristics/information sources investigated and the detailed hypothesis addressed, stated in Table 1, follow directly from the cited literature. Several characteristics of the individual might explain information seeking, but social status, gregariousness, marital status, and age are suggested to be particularly relevant to the study of the search patterns associated with symbolic products. For example, to protect a po- sition of high status an individual might not seek infor- mation directly from peers, but rather rely on less con- 75</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1983 Table 1 H,: POSTULATED PATTERNS OF INFORMATION SEEKING ~~Search p ~Patterns Search characteristics Minimal and information Peer Spouse Retail external sources used assisted assisted dominant search Deliberation 0 + 0 - Fashion media + - + Joint shopping with spouse - + - - Influence of peer group norms + 0 + Peer verbal + - - - Peer visual + + - - Prior specification of style + + - - Spouse verbal - + - - Store personnel - - + + Retail search 0 0 + Note: + indicates above average, 0 average, and - below average values of these factors. spicuous sources such as store personnel and/or spouse. Similarly, on marriage an individual presumably not only gains a valued source of advice, but also experi- ences a significant change in lifestyle. Gregariousness and age also are relevant to symbolic products because they too partially determine an individual's social en- vironment. A variety of other effects are possible; for instance, increasing age may be a surrogate for accu- mulated product experience and hence less reason for external information search. Furthermore, it is likely that there are significant interactions among all the various individual characteristics (e.g., age positively correlated with income). Therefore, just as other researchers have simplified their task by identifying patterns of informa- tion search, one may appropriately postulate the various types of individual who may be expected to display dif- ferent search patterns when purchasing a symbolic prod- uct. Table 2 details these postulated types and Table 3 shows the hypothesized relationships between types of individual and patterns of information seeking. In es- sence discrete market segments are related to defined search patterns in a straightforward manner, and one which can be readily subjected to an empirical test. The final hypothesis pertains to the social risk in- volved in the purchase of a symbolic product, and sim- ply states that the socially riskier the product (suit style) chosen, the greater the external information search, par- ticularly that utilizing personal sources. METHOD Data Collection The research instrument was a questionnaire admin- istered to a sample of 500 men living in England, Scot- land, and Wales. As well as eliciting measures of the various individual characteristics, it included several questions about information sought during the respond- ent's most recent suit purchase. For such a method to be feasible the item purchased must be memorable, and Table 2 H2: POSTULATED DESCRIPTIONS OF TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL Types Individual High characteristics status Married Single Uninvolved Age + 0 - + Attitude to fashion change 0 0 + Attitude to fashion risk 0 0 + Gregariousness + - + Gross income + 0 - 0 Marital status - - + - Occupational status + 0 0 Purchase frequency + 0 + Store loyalty - 0 - + Note: + indicates above average, 0 average, and - below average values of these factors. pilot research showed that a suit purchased within the last year meets this criterion. However, industry sources indicated that men's suit buying peaks around age 25 and declines thereafter. In fact, men over 45 account for only 25 to 30% of the market (NEDO 1970; EIU 1975), and possibly only purchase every two to three years. Hence, to reduce fieldwork costs, those men between the ages of 15 and 44 who had bought within the last 12 months (average time since purchase 5 months) were sampled. Forty sampling points were selected with probability proportional to size from a stratified list of electoral dis- tricts. As an age-based sampling frame for individuals was lacking, respondents were chosen within these dis- tricts by a quota method with a prespecified selection and travel procedure. Though this was not a random sample, Sudman (1976, p. 193) suggests that the bias in such a design is typically small. The quota controls were age and social class. It was recognized that locating certain respondent types (notably younger, higher social class) would be difficult and that some cells might re- quire reweighting. One can argue that if a sound basis for adjusting a sample exists this additional information should be used (Kalton and Moser 1971, p. 140). Ex- cellent and relatively recent census data were available. The disadvantages of reweighting are that it reduces the Table 3 H3: POSTULATED RELATIONS BETWEEN TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL AND PATTERNS OF INFORMATION SEEKING Patterns Retail Minimal Individual Peer Spouse search external types assisted assisted dominant search Single + Married + High status + + Uninvolved + 76</page><page sequence="4">INTERPERSONAL INFORMATION SEEKING Table 4 MEASURES Individual characteristics 1.

About 68 questionnaries were rejected in editing (no missing val- ues allowed), and the effective sample size of the 432 remaining responses is 354. Practically, the reweighting had minor consequences, but the apparent loss in de- grees of freedom is offset by the gain in confidence which comes from a less biased sample. Measures The variables used in the study are summarized in Table 4. Tables 5 and 6 report the ranges, means, stan- dard deviations, and zero order correlations of these variables. In the past, information source usage has been mea- sured by simple "did use/did not use" questions or with some attempt to measure importance by adding a third "used, main source" category (e.g., Westbrook and Fomell 1979). A better measure of information seeking may be obtained if the influence of the information is also measured. Such a measure was operationalized by asking respondents to indicate (on a 5-point scale) their Table 5 VARIABLES USED IN ANALYSIS: MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES Variable 1.

Retail search 23 perception of the degree of influence each source exerted on their behavior, particularly with respect to their choice of suit style.l However, some individuals might not overtly discuss the specific purchase with their peers but "know" from previous discussion or observation that group norms favor certain styles. A clear perception of group norms is a form of internalized prior search, and as such may have strong effects on information seeking. The influence of peer group norms was mea- sured in the following manner. During the interview re- spondents were shown sketches of six major styles and asked to rank these from "fashionable" to "conserva- tive." Subsequently they were also asked whether or not their peers would approve of their wearing the styles they had just ranked as "most fashionable" and "most conservative." The two 5-point scales were summed (after appropriate reversal) to form an index of perceived social pressure. Most multivariate techniques assume interval-level data; therefore if the original question yielded ordinal measures these were transformed to the interval level (under the assumption of an underlying normal popula- tion distribution) by the method of successive categories (Guilford 1954, p. 223). To measure the social risk involved in a particular choice of style, the six sketches were again used. These had been selected as representative by experts, and in- cluded one which was the latest major style innovation and which was purchased by only about 36% of the sam- 'Both pilot studies and the research reported here show that, in com- parison with fit, material, or price, style is perceived as being the most important attribute of a suit. In this study only 4% of respondents volunteered price as an important purchase factor (average rank 4.0), in contrast to 45% who mentioned style (average rank 1.6). Further- more, 75% of respondents bought with cash and only 25% on credit. For these reasons financial risk was not considered. pie. Clearly the other 64% may have seen certain social risks in purchasing this latest fashion, an assertion sup- ported by the data on perceptions of peer reaction. Data Analysis The objective of analysis was to categorize respond- ents according to both their individual characteristics and their patterns of prepurchase information seeking. Of the several multivariate techniques which can be used to form segments (factor analysis, multidimensional scal- ing, etc.), a cluster analytic method was chosen. Fur- thermore, to overcome some of the limitations of the commonly used cluster analysis algorithms, the method developed by Cooper and Lewis (CL) was chosen (Lewis 1974). Though the end solution of the CL method appears similar to that of other cluster tech- niques, its major strengths-which are primarily in its use of principal component scores-are worth detailing. First, by using principal components analysis to trans- form the original data, one performs clustering in a highly metric space with orthogonal dimensions. The properties of this space, intuitively at least, make the use of distance analogies conceptually sounder than in some other algorithms. Second, because the components are based on the answers to several questionnaire items, they provide inherently more reliable constructs for cluster- ing. Third, by selecting a reduced number of principal components the analyst concentrates on the more im- portant relationships, eliminating much of the "noise" inherent in sample data. Fourth, the CL algorithm has a rational basis for assigning importance to clustering variables, because the dimensions can be weighted ac- cording to the percentage of the variance they explained in the original data. Fifth, if C is the pooled within-clus- ters sum of squares and cross-products and T is the total sum of squares and cross-products, by direct analogy to discriminant analysis one can form a statistic (lambda) 78</page><page sequence="6">INTERPERSONAL INFORMATION SEEKING equal to the ratio of the determinants of C and T which can then be subjected to a chi square test (Tatsuoka 1971). The CL clustering algorithm was specially pro- grammed in FORTRAN for this study. The principal components analysis was performed by a standard pro- gram (BMDP4M), but with a pseudojackknife approach (Crask and Perreault 1977). This approach was used to assess the robustness of the findings to sample selection and was achieved by randomly allocating respondents to one of five equal groups. As might be expected, given the careful selection of variables and the large sample size, the overall principal components solutions were robust. A reduced set of components was selected by standard heuristics, and the individual scores on this re- duced set were input to the CL clustering program. A variety of distance thresholds were chosen and cluster solutions extracted. The "best" cluster solutions were identified by plotting the lambda statistic. To assess the robustness of the CL technique, seven random starting points were used for each threshold value and the solutions obtained compared, the solu- tion(s) with the highest commonality being preferred. Every solution was also compared with one generated by randomly assigning cases to an identical number of clusters. This procedure simply demonstrates that the solution is "better" than can be achieved by chance. External validity was assessed by examining the theo- retical "meaning" of the various clusters emerging from the analyses. RESULTS Preliminary Checks Some preliminary checks were made on the measures to ensure that they were suitable for further analysis and to ascertain whether there were any systematic effects of time of purchase on the information-seeking mea- sures.2 For the latter check, respondents were divided into four quarterly time periods and an analysis of var- iance was performed. Only three of the information- seeking measures showed any significant effects. Fur- thermore, two of these had essentially slight differences in the four period means (influence of person accom- panying, purchase deliberation). However, the third (visual influence) had a pattern wherein one period had a mean score twice that of the others. To the extent that this last variable was used in subsequent analyses, some bias may have been introduced. Principal Component Analyses Tables 7 and 8 summarize these analyses for the in- dividual characteristics and the information-seeking 2Two variables, fashion designer awareness and recall of retail ad- vertising, were eliminated as having both low mean scores and little variance. A third, print media exposure, was abandoned as it proved extremely difficult to discriminate between newspapers on the basis of their (scant) editorial coverage of male fashion.

In each case both the eigenval- ues-greater-than-one rule and the scree test (Stewart 1981) suggested that four components were sufficient to describe the data. For individual characteristics the first component is clearly a life cycle dimension, discriminating between the older, married respondents and the younger, single, more outgoing individuals. The second is a status di- mension linking income, occupational status, gregari- ousness, and purchase frequency. Here it is termed "status involvement" because it appears to connote in- volvement and interest in clothing which stems from one's social position. The third dimension is primarily attitudinal and the fourth picks up an apparently isolated measure-store loyalty. For the information-seeking measures, we can readily see that the first component discriminates between sources of information. Simply, it appears to indicate whether reliance was placed on an individual's peers or whether a female partner was consulted. Of interest is the finding that visual influence is related to discussion with peers and to a perception of stronger group norms, as is consistent with the arguments of Moschis (1976, p. 240). The second component is primarily the extent of interpersonal information search. The fact that retail search also has a positive loading seems intuitively rea- sonable. Presumably the more prior discussion defines the desired product, the more retail search an individual might find necessary to locate an appropriate article. The third component essentially represents the amount of time individuals thought they had spent deliberating over the purchase, though it is notable that this appears in- dependent of any measure of external information search. Finally, the fourth component relates to the situation at the (final) retail outlet, effectively discriminating be- tween men who made their own suit selection from the 79</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1983 Table 8 JACKKNIFED COMPONENT LOADINGS FOR INFORMATION-SEEKING MEASURES Component Variable 1 2 3 4 Purchase deliberation 90- Person accompanying -64a 59a Peer group norms 50' 46b Discussion with others 47" 49' 51" Visual influence 55s 36b Prior specification 51" -65b Discussion with female -60a 49a -43b Store assistance 76" Retail search 47b Cumulative percent variance 21 36 49 61 Descriptive label Significant Extent of Deliberation Sales others interpersonal situation influence 't-value significant at p &lt; 0.01. bt-value significant at p &lt; 0.05.

Further, the decisive group made little use of store personnel, but may have visited more outlets than the deliberate and may have been bet- ter guided by group norms. Next, though the men with the retail-dominant pattern did undertake extensive phys- ical shopping activity, contrary to expectations this was shopping accompanied by a woman and with more de- liberation/prespecification than thought. Because this pattern also had the highest score on the second com- ponent it was relabeled "extensive external search" (17%). The spouse-assisted pattern (21%) also deviated from H1 in that it involved less deliberation/prespeci- fication, less influence of group norms, and more use of store personnel than expected. However, the peer-as- sisted pattern (14%) was almost exactly as hypothesized. In contrast, the individual types represented in Table 10 seem to give broad support to H2. The uninvolved segment (22%) is exactly as postulated, and the single (29%) and the high status (24%) types differ on only a couple of measures. However, the fourth segment, mar- ried (26%), provides some surprises. In particular, these men appear to show strong positive attitudes toward the product, whereas more neutral values were expected. They are also somewhat older, lower status, and less frequent purchasers than assumed. Thus their involve- ment with the product field seems essentially only atti- tudinal, and not driven by status or life cycle consid- erations. For these reasons this type is relabeled "profashion." To provide deeper understanding, H3 was advanced to examine the possible relationships between the types of individual and the patterns of information seeking. Table 11 is the appropriate contingency table, where the important indicator is the adjusted standardized deviation identifying the discrepancy between actual cell values and the chance expectation (Haberman 1973). In light of the preceding discussion, H3 requires some modifi- cation but the main thrust seems to be confirmed. Sin- gles indeed appear to seek peer assistance as evidenced by the sole high positive value of the adjusted standard- ized deviation. The uninvolved do mainly exhibit min- imal external search though of the deliberate form. As argued before, the high status individuals appear to shun conspicuous sources of information (particularly peers) and if necessary turn instead to their spouses. However, the more significant and unexpected effect is for them to display the decisive form of minimal external search. In hindsight this finding makes considerable sense, for these individuals are exactly the type of competent de- cision makers who might be expected to reach a rapid solution. Furthermore, with a high purchase frequency, they presumably have greater experience with garment purchasing, are more likely to have internalized group norms, and hence have less need for additional infor- mation. It is useful to speculate that this type of indi- vidual is most likely to be using internal search pro- cesses. However, it is more difficult to speculate on the nature of the deliberate form. Perhaps these individuals Table 11 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL AND PATTERNS OF INFORMATION SEEKINGa Individual types Patterns High of Uninvolved information status Profashion Single Uninvolved information seeking %b SDC % SD % SD % SD Minimal external search: deliberate 4.7 -1.7 6.5 -0.3 6.3 -1.3 8.6 3.5 Peer assisted 1.4 -2.8 1.4 -3.2 10.9 8.8 0.7 -3.4 Extensive external search 3.0 -1.2 7.2 3.6 3.3 -1.9 3.3 -0.4 Spouse assisted 6.3 1.7 5.6 0.3 3.7 -2.5 4.9 0.6 Minimal external search: decisive 8.3 3.6 5.4 -0.5 4.7 -2.0 4.0 -1.0 "Chi square is 104 which with 12 degrees of freedom is significant at p &lt; 0.001. bPercentage of the total sample.

Finally, the profashion segment seems to fit primarily into the extensive external search category. Although these individuals have posi- tive attitudes, they perhaps lack strong motivations, such as role or status, and thus require an extensive search process. Though Table 11 provides an interpretable test of H3 and is a logical development from prior literature, it does not yield an index of the explanatory power of the in- dividual characteristics. Accordingly, a discriminant analysis was conducted with the patterns of information seeking as the grouping variable and the four compo- nents of the individual characteristics as independent variables. With all components included, Wilks' lambda was 0.69 (approximate F 10.3, p &lt; 0.001) and the jack- knifed classification matrix had 37.3% of cases correctly classified (u-method). This proportion is significantly higher than the chance expectation of 20.9% (p &lt; 0.00001). The best predicted of the patterns is peer as- sisted (61% correct), followed by deliberate (46%) and decisive (39%). The spouse-assisted (25%) and exten- sive (17%) patterns are poorly predicted by this set of measures. Though on the F-to-enter criterion the third (attitudinal) component would be excluded, without it there is no ability to discriminate between these last two patterns. H4 was tested in two ways. First, an analysis of var- iance was computed between the extent of interpersonal influence component scores and choice of style. Second, a contingency table was formed between the latter vari- able and the patterns of information seeking (Table 12). For the socially riskier style the mean extent of inter- personal influence score is .26 compared with -0.15 for the more conservative styles, yielding an F-value of 17.7 which is significant at p &lt; 0.001 (variances being ac- cepted as equal). Table 12 shows that the purchase of a socially riskier style is more likely to involve the use of peer referents than is the purchase of a conservative style. Thus both facets of H4 are confirmed. IMPLICATIONS This study represents three major departures from work reported in the cited literature. First, by examining a symbolic item it concerns a product class whose pur- chase might involve consumer motivations different from those associated with durable products and hence possibly different search patterns. Second, the nature of the product class risk is recognized, and the differing degrees of this risk associated with constituent members of that class assessed. Third, the inclusion of detailed measures of peer and spouse influence allows the inves- tigation of information sources whose importance has theoretical justification, but whose use has not been well developed previously. The arguments that symbolic products might involve different modes of search seem partially supportable. More than half the sample was involved in a reasonable amount of external information search, including a seg- ment of individuals displaying an extensive and balanced information-seeking process. However, though the gross features of these search patterns are fairly similar to those for durables, new patterns of source usage are found and the underlying motivations for using these sources could also be different. For the product studied, interpersonal sources of information are dominant; the only retailer-controlled source of significance is assis- tance by store personnel. This finding is clear evidence that the purchase of products whose primary purpose may be social is likely to invoke the search for infor- mation from other individuals rather than objective or impersonal sources. Only from a peer or spouse can the individual obtain social feedback as to the appropriate- ness of the choice. It is also arguable that not only is the nominal rationale for the purchase of a symbolic item different from that for the purchase of a functional one, but even within a product class individuals' purchases may be driven by a variety of different motives-motives which can significantly affect their information-seeking patterns. For symbolic items, role and status are found to be of particular significance. As to the other departures, both the nature and degree of risk appeared to be important and it was necessary to distinguish between different sources of interpersonal information. Because of the importance of risk, future research should acknowledge such product differences more explicitly. Further, concepts such as the diffusion of innovation or the product life cycle may be relevant 82</page><page sequence="10">INTERPERSONAL INFORMATION SEEKING to studies of information-seeking behavior. With respect to information sources, the findings demonstrate the rel- evance of measuring a variety of interpersonal sources, and sources utilized in both a direct (verbal) manner and in the less obvious observational (visual) mode. The method used in this research should be improved, and in particular much remains to be done in developing reliable and validated measures of information seeking/ perceived influence. Some measures of internal infor- mation storage and recall should be incorporated as well. It is obviously also of interest to replicate and extend this type of method to other symbolic products, and per- haps eventually to hedonic items. Only by building an extensive repertoire of product/market situations can we obtain a more developed model of information-seeking behavior. In terms of managerial relevance, the method used leads to segments meaningful to a marketing executive, and furthermore suggests useful marketing actions. For example, an executive might contemplate (1) advertising aimed at reinforcing peer group norms for singles or (2) providing better information and sales assistance for pro- fashion types involved in extensive external search. Nat- urally the worth of such suggestions would need testing, but the fact that they are so readily generated demon- strates that the method has practical application.
