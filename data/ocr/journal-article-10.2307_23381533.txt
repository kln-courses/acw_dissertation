<plain_text><page sequence="1">PARABLES IN MIDRASH Alan Mintz In the general literary community located well beyond the small circle of professional scholars of rabbinic literature there has been in recent years a remarkable explosion of interest in the subject of midrash. Intertextuality, indeterminacy, semantic playfulness, polysemy — these and other qualities held in high regard by the new currents in literary theory were suddenly discovered to reside, authentic and unalloyed, in the ancient exegetical discourse of the Rabbis. "Midrash and literature," and "midrash as literature" were for a time compelling topics of critical discussion. The winds of literary theory are now blowing in different, more severely ideological directions, and it is unclear whether midrash will retain its great attractiveness. In any event, midrash's moment of fame in the larger world of literary studies calls attention to a phenomenon — of longer duration, one hopes — that moves in the opposite direction: the absorption of critical methods from literary theory into the professional study of midrash. It has long been felt by rabbbinic scholars sensitive to aesthetic issues that a fascinating drama of textuality and intertextuality was being enacted within midrash that was not being captured by the available philological and historical tools. The disciplined elaboration of descriptive poetics, especially narratology, and, in a lesser and more complicated way, the speculations of deconstruction, have provided a set of instruments which, if applied responsibly, would help to unlock the treasures of midrash. A great deal of promise has surrounded this prospect, yet the results have been slow to come. Daniel Boyarin's Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (1990) was a first attempt to engage some of the theoretical issues. The work of James Kugel and of Michael Fishbane has also been implicitly informed by these new insights. But it is only with the publication of David Stern's Parables in Midrash that we have a fully realized study of midrash based on literary principles. Whereas one might naturally expect a work that is the first of its kind to be tentative, sketchy, and even rash, Stern's book comes across as remarkably authoritative, comprehensive, and judicious. The strength and clarity of this volume derive from Stern's acknowledgement of the complexity of midrash and his decision to isolate one midrashic genre and treat it in depth. What he has done for the mashal (parable) can serve as a model for studies of the petihta, the ma'aseh, the derashah, the aggadic story and other forms of midrashic writing; this disciplined focus prepares the ground for the day when we shall have a comprehensive description of the poetics of midrash. In the meantime, we have before us a model of how to proceed. David Stern, Parables in Midrash: Narrative and Exegesis in Rabbinic Literature, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991, xiii + 347 pp. 75</page><page sequence="2">Stern's overall conception of his subject is presented as an alternative to the two historically dominant approaches to the nature of the mashal. On the one hand, there is the conception of the mashal as illustration, most familiar to us writes Stern, "sees the literary י',from Maimonides. "This view of the mashal form as a device for illustrating abstract ideas or beliefs through narrative examples that are concrete, familiar, and thus more easily comprehended" (p. 48). On the other hand, there is the conception of the mashal as secret speech, which was probably the view favored by the Rabbis themselves. According to this approach, the mashal is an esoteric mode of communication employed to express controversial ideas that could not be articulated openly for political or doctrinal reasons. Stern finds the first model insufficient because it does not account for the rhetorical complexity of most meshalim, which could "illustrate" their truths more directly if that were their main objective. He finds the secret-speech model simply does not describe the vast majority of meshalim, which, despite their subtlety and ambiguity, can be understood by any reader who is merely "sufficiently competent" rather than necessarily initiated into an esoteric body of knowledge. In contrast, Stern argues for a model he calls "the mashal as rhetorical narrative." According to this view, the mashal is neither a secret tale with hidden meaning nor a transparent story with a clear-cut moral. Rather, it is a story that turns allusiveness to effect in order to persuade its audience of the value of a certain idea or approach or feeling. Unlike the two other models which respectively conceive of the mashal as an instrument for either demonstrating or concealing the truth, this model represents the mashal's relation to meaning as oblique and indirect. While the mashal suggests its message to its audience, it requires them in the end to deduce that message .(51 .for themselves (p Stern's definition of the mashal thus stresses two features that distinguish its literariness. Calling the mashal a story (really two stories, one belonging to the mashal-proper and the other to the nimshal, i.e. the moral) enables — indeed, requires — us to think of it in terms of all the categories that have been developed to describe phenomena of narrative generally: event, plot, character, motive, point of view, implied reader, and so on. Furthermore, claiming that the message of the mashal is neither transparent nor concealed requires us to be attentive to the rhetorical patterning of the mashal and to such devices as gaps and ambiguities that enact the mashal's directed "indirection." Before undertaking to describe the poetics of the mashal, that is, the literary properties of the mashal as narrative, Stern first turns to the compositional features that characterize the corpus of rabbinic meshalim in their historical specificity. First and foremost is the nimshal. Many have argued that the nimshal is secondary in importance relative to the mashal-proper. They claim either that it was attached at a later time in order to explicate a lost original meaning or that its job was to give a normative summation of the mashal's meaning. In contrast, Stern insists on the radical originality and integrity of the 76</page><page sequence="3">nimshal. The nimshal was part and parcel of the mashal from the outset, because the very meaning of the mashal depends upon the inconsistent fit between these two parts and because the nimshal is a necessary exegetical compensation for an unavailable narrative context. The second conspicuous feature of the mashal is the centrality of the figure of the king and his household. They are modeled on the realia and regalia of the Roman procuratorial administration, as delineated at the beginning of this century by Ignaz Ziegler in his monumental study. Stern's contribution here is to demonstrate how over time the king mashal comes to dominate the genre, even when this narrative situation is not thematically necessary. He calls this the regularization of the mashal. He also shifts the terms of the discussion from the question of historical referentiality (Do the meshalim mirror imperial practice?) to the use the Rabbis made of the king as a narrative construction. Third and most important is the phenomenon of stereotyping. Stern persuasively demonstrates the highly conventional nature of the genre. On the semantic level, there are limited numbers of recognizable formulas that structure the mashal, from such introductory phrases as mashal le..., benohag she-ba-olam, and melekh basar va-dam (in the case of the mashal-proper) to the ubiquitous kakh (in the case of the nimshal). The characters are stereotyped as well (the king, his consort, and children), as are the dramatic situations (disloyalty/ loyalty, anger, expulsion, reconciliation, etc.). How this inventory of stock material was fashioned into the varied and sophisticated meshalim that stud collections like Eikhah Rabba is explained by recourse to the classical scholarship on the composition of traditional literature. Like the orally improvised epic poetry studied by Milman Perry and Albert Lord, each mashal was an act of compositional performance in which the darshan drew from a relatively fixed repertoire of phrases, motifs, and themes, to create a new or variant text. Any serious account of a literary genre or type must take responsibility for describing its poetics, that is, the unique ways in which the text produces its meaning. In the case of the mashal, this is not an easy task. The Rabbis displayed little hermeneutical self-consciousness about the parables they were writing, and the medievals also did not feel impelled to theorize about the mashal. This essentially leaves the modern discipline of poetics, which has developed significantly in the past twenty-five years, and which is one of the few areas in literary theory that is built upon a solid and usable base of expanding knowledge. The problem with poetics, however, is that its insights are largely deduced from modern poetry and novels; applying the categories of poetics mechanically to the literary products of Late Antiquity, like midrash, can produce laughable results. The determined student of midrash must therefore proceed cautiously but inventively. He, or she, must first carefully winnow the theoretical literature for usable ideas and then resourcefully adapt them for the very particular features of rabbinic discourse. In Parables in Midrash, David Stern has met this challenge very successfully. Three examples will illustrate this achievement. The first concerns what is 77</page><page sequence="4">probably the thorniest theoretical knot in describing the mashal: Is it narrative or exegesis? Is the story contained in the mashal subordinated to the larger purpose of addressing an exegetical problem in the text, or conversely, is the interpretation of the verse "tacked on" to the primary thrust of the story? This is preeminently a problem in poetics, but it is not one the reader is likely to find addressed in the contemporary theoretical literature. By locating and adapting work that has been done on the modern ideological novel, Stern is able to make a strong case for seeing exegesis as a camouflage technique used in the service of the mashal's ideational agenda. And as with other types of ideological literature, a good part of the mashal's art lies in its capacity for obscuring its ideological purpose. Sometimes this is accomplished simply by hiding rhetoric under the cloak of exegesis; at other times, by pretending that the midrashic interpretation of the verse is indeed the necessary, inevitable meaning. This impression is achieved, in turn, by making the mashal's narrative appear to create or to produce the nimshal, which then serves as the setting for the interpretation of the mashal's prooftext, for the midrashic event of interpretation. The prooftext, once interpreted via the nimshal, then casts back upon the preceding narrative the aura of its own scriptural authority, as though to authenticate that narrative, to salvage it from the triviality of mere fictionality. Thus a whole seamless rhetorical artifice is created inside which ideology hides (p. 68). The second crux concerns the hallmark of the mashal, the bipartite structure of the mashal-proper and the nimshal: What is their relationship? It is essential to Stern's case that the nimshal not be viewed either as a late tack-on, or simply as a didactic allegorical solution to the mashal. He is right to note that the relationship between the two parts of the mashal is often characterized by a wide variety of gaps. This often takes the form of events in the mashal-proper that are left unexplained in the nimshal. Why the king abandons his consort or sends her away, or the nature of the sins committed by the son to warrant punishment — these questions will often not be taken up in the nimshal. Sometimes the last word is given to the king in the mashal but withheld in the nimshal so as to orient the closure toward the consort's situation. Utilizing Meir Sternberg's work on biblical narrative, Stern persuasively shows how these gaps are cannily managed by the Rabbis in a way that in fact bears much resemblance to the strategic restraint of biblical story-telling. Often what the Rabbis choose not to "solve" in the nimshal is a way of their dealing with sensitive issues of theodicy: how to praise God's compassion at the same time one is acknowledging the mysteries of His justice. After the series of close readings Stern has presented it will be much more difficult for readers of midrash innocently to write off these gaps and disparities as textual and redactional loose ends. The third issue in poetics concerns characterization, particulary the depiction of God as a king. There has been much scholarly attention devoted to the paradoxical choice of the Rabbis to make the Roman imperial court the model 78</page><page sequence="5">for God's divinity. Stern joins this discussion and further points out an additional distinction of the mashal. Whereas in other classical Hebrew literature God is described as acting as a king, it is only in the narrative section of the mashal that God is represented as an independently existing character who is a king. There is the further problem that the character of the king performs actions that are radically inconsistent, even contradictory, from mashal to mashal. Stern's approach to the problem makes use of the notion in narratology that, rather than being the embodiment of some essence, character is a construct that is a function of the story. In literary terms, then, the usual relationship is turned around. The disparate behaviors of the king/ God are not manifestations of his inner being; they are a function of homiletical or exegetical purposes of the mashal. "As a character," Stern writes, "each portrait of God is too unpredictable, too uncanny, to be anything other than a creation of the imagination." Indeed, it is the humanness rather than the divinity of the king figure that served the Rabbis so well. For "only human behavior presented the Rabbis with a model sufficiently complex to do justice to God. In the king-mashal narratives, the anthropomorphic imagination of the Rabbis reached its greatest height of achievement" (p. 101). Now, poetics is a development of formalism, and as such it focuses on uncovering the implicit rules for the making of meaning rather than on assessing the substance of that meaning. It is a tribute to the comprehensiveness of Stern's project that he addresses the thematics of the mashal as well as its poetics. Chapter four of Parables in Midrash is devoted to the themes expressed in the mashal, which Stem organizes under five headings: apologetics, polemics, eulogy and consolation, complaining, and regret and warning. There are close readings of meshalim scattered throughout the volume, but it is in this chapter that one most fully appreciates Stern's integrative literary approach to the mashal as well as his intelligence and sensitivity as a reader of classical texts. The readings are closely argued and demanding of attention, and one is often led to note them for future use rather than working through them on the spot. (In this regard, Parables in Midrash possesses certain impressive characteristics of a handbook or reference book.) But the readings are always lucid and intelligible and written without jargon and with much intellectual grace. They also display wide culture: Stern has read classical Greek and Latin literature, as well as modern European literature, and this experience gives his readings nuance and sophistication. There is something cautionary in his success. It indicates that there is great promise in literary approaches to midrash but also that there is little to be gained by mechanically applying formulas and methods. The final sections of Stern's study locate the mashal along horizontal and vertical axes within the history and variety of Hebrew literature. Chapter five examines the realtions of the mashal in its own period with other forms of midrashic discourse: the derashah, the petihta, the aggadic narrative, the enumeration, and series of meshalim. Chapter six moves forward in time to the employment of the mashal in parallel and later contexts: the Synoptic Gospels (Stern's remarks on this subject form an important small essay in its own right), 79</page><page sequence="6">Tanna de-Bei Eliyahu, Sefer Bahir, Maimonides, and the Zohar. Useful to the scholar is an appendix containing the Hebrew texts (with manuscript variations noted) of the meshalim from Eikhah Rabbah, which form the central corpus of examples for the book. An index to rabbinic texts is also appended. This is an exemplary volume that should set a standard for literary work on midrash and rabbinic literature as a whole. 80</page></plain_text>
