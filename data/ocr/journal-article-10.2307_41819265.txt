These neighborhood-based parades provide an opportunity for memorialization and the cultivation of critical skills for leadership and community organization. In this essay, I argue that Disney's The Princess and the Frog plays the role of a "second line" in Disney's genre of "princess" films. While Disney attempts to produce Princess Tiana as empowered, grounded, and down-to-earth, the colorful film still relies heavily on reproductions of racial ideologies that sanitize the everyday lives of African-Americans and normalize whiteness. Keywords Tiana • Exceptionalism • Racial ideologies • Second lines • Whiteness Introduction Disney's 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog offers an important metaphor of the second line tradition in New Orleans, although with a twist. Second lines reveal the humanity of blacks by allowing them to subvert traditions of exclusive hierarchies. My argument in this essay is that Disney's second line attempts to reveal the humanity of blacks while reasserting traditions of racial hierarchy. The movie provides a useful example of how second lines can take an old text and bring a new translation to it. Disney brings a new translation to a classic fairy tale, The Frog Prince , by transforming the standard, well-known tale about a frog who must find a princess willing to kiss it in order to release the spell S.

In The Princess and the Frog , Disney riffs the story much like a jazz performer does with the old Snow White tune, Someday My Prince Will Come. 1 In the movie, the frog prince kisses Tiana, someone who is not an actual princess, turning her into a frog with him. This marks the beginning of a journey that takes the frogs through New Orleans seeking to discover who they really are and restore their humanity. While individualism and romantic engagement continue to exist as themes now attached to representations of blackness, there is another project that Disney undertakes in this film - maintaining its investment in whiteness - that warrants further consideration. Even though Disney attempts to produce Princess Tiana as empowered, grounded, and down-to-earth, the colorful film still relies heavily on the reproduction of the ideology of whiteness that sanitizes the everyday lives of African-Americans and normalizes whiteness. In Disney's second line, Disney inverts the princess role, casting Tiana as the protagonist while allowing Charlotte to perform as the princess (since her father was to be King of Carnival), dancing "the princess dance". Tiana spends an inordinate amount of time in her anthropomorphic form and, I would argue, does not really move us beyond the stereotypical image of black women as invisible or as solely attached to labor. As a tradition in New Orleans, second lining was born in the shadows of Mardi Gras. Second line is an ambiguous term with multiple meanings." Helen Regis (2001), an anthropologist who does participant observation of the second line phenomenon, writes that second line refers to "a kind of parade distinguishable from the processions of Mardi Gras Krewes, St. Patrick's Day parades, and other performances in which one finds a sharp distinction between performers and audience" (755). Second lines usually follow improvised courses throughout the city, stopping to memorialize certain deceased members of social clubs or to patronize bars. They can grow anywhere from 200 to 5,000 people, as the audience is encouraged to leave the sidelines and join in the parade (Regis 2001: 755). 1 The Disney theme song from the first-ever Princess movie Snow White, Someday My Prince Will Come , became a standard among jazz performers, with Miles Davis giving what was perhaps one of the most memorable performances in 1961 on an album with the same title. Davis began with a familiar treatment of the classic song and then John Coltrane proceeded to take the tune into another stratosphere (before he exited the sextet) to bring a new translation to this familiar standard. Perhaps less familiar is Lena Home's 1967 performance of the same tune. Home takes Adriana Caselotti's 1937 up-tempo and turns it into a moody, solemn jazz reflection on the song's "wish" statement. Her performance punctuates with a question mark instead of a period, with her vocal intonation and facial expression leaving the audience to wonder whether she really believes in the possibility (that her prince would someday come) or whether she is singing from an internal place of skepticism or even cynicism. Her prince would come, perhaps, but Home leaves the impression that that is really not the point. She must not indulge in this fantasy that some prince will rescue her. Home lyrically tells us that she would need to make her own dreams come true. Like Ms. Home, Tiana is not invested in "waiting for a prince to make her dreams come true." 2 According to Helen Regis, second lines can refer to dance steps performed by club members and their followers during the parades. It can also refer to a "distinctive syncopated rhythm (Riley and Vidacovich 1995)" (Regis 2001). As Regis contends, "second line means the followers, or joiners, who fall in behind the first line, composed of the brass band and the social club, which typically sponsors the parade" (Regis 2001: 755). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">434 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-^49 Similarly in his persuasive discussion of Mardi Gras Indians, George Lipsitz (1988) contends that "The neighborhood residents who attend weekly practice sessions and who follow the tribes into the streets as their 'second line' function as active participants in the performance, not just as passive spectators. Second liners beat on bottles with sticks, shake tambourines attached to long poles, and dance to rhythmic chants in an interactive call and response with the singers and dancers in the tribe" (Lipsitz 1988: 106). Because carnival parades were only open to whites in New Orleans, blacks decided to form their own parade tradition. In his article, "Behind the Lines: The Black Mardi Gras Indians and the New Orleans Second Line", Michael Smith (1994) suggests that second lines are different from traditional social and pleasure clubs, which are more established, incorporated, and usually abide by city regulations and parade permits (48). For Smith, second lines incorporate music and dance but are "characterized by unrestrained expressions of African-American dance and song and a rejection of the 'destiny' of the white establishment to govern black society. As ritual African-American celebrations, second-line parades in New Orleans remain distinctly different in character from white parades in New Orleans..." (Smith 1994: 49) According to him, Second-line parades serve to cleanse and renew the spirit of the community. They also function to disseminate information. It is from this source - not television or the newspapers controlled by the white establishment - that blacks learn what is taking place in the city. These events intricately link the greater African- American community of New Orleans historically, economi- cally, political, culturally, and spiritually and are considered freedom celebrations in New Orleans. (Smith, 1994: 49) Going to New Orleans is not new for Disney. In 1966, Disney installed New Orleans Square in its southern California theme park. This homage to the French Quarter, or Vieux Carré, replicated the district "that means New Orleans to the outside world" (Souther 2007: 804). Disney's New Orleans Square offered a colorful albeit sanitized replica of the Quarter, preserving the distinctive nineteenth century architecture and nostalgia of New Orleans. It also preserved a racial order (that was in the midst of being dismantled in the 1960s civil rights struggle) by encouraging its theme park tourists to safely "remember" the good old colonial days, with its racial hierarchy firmly in place (Souther 2007: 805). Disney's 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog uses similar strategies, updated to reflect the social and political reality of the twenty-first century's historical election of President Barack Obama, to remind its audience of the "good old days" when a racial hierarchy was firmly in place. Although Disney's introduction of its first African-American princess takes a solid step forward, the company reasserts its "possessive investment in whiteness"3 by relying on the strategies of racial stereotype, minstrelsy, and an 3 George Lipsitz pioneered the concept of the "possessive investment of whiteness". Even though Disney invested heavily into the commercial success of Tiana, it also did not wish to alienate its mainstream audience who still consumes all of the other princesses. Disney basically uses the strategy of "add black princess and stir" to bring diversity into its princess medley. For further explanation of this idea, see Lipsitz (1998). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-^449 435 appeal to colorblind multiculturalism for its mainstream audience. The task of this essay will be to try to articulate whiteness in a film that is premised on the commercial success of its first black princess. Kings, Carnivals, and Disney's Possessive Investment in Whiteness The trope of Mardi Gras runs as a thread throughout the movie, stitching together Disney's multicultural quilt with the thread of whiteness. Throughout this movie (as is the case in mostly all of the Disney princess films), whiteness generally remains unmarked. In The Possessive Investment in Whiteness , George Lipsitz (1998) extends the point here that "as an unmarked category against which difference is constructed, whiteness never has to speak its name, never has to acknowledge its role as an organizing principle in social and cultural relations." (1). Furthering this point, Howard Winant (2004) contends that whiteness is "an over determined political and cultural identity nevertheless, having to do with socioeconomic status, religious affiliation, ideologies of individualism, opportunity, and citizenship, nationalism, and so on. Like any other complex of beliefs and practices, 'whiteness' is embedded in a highly articulated social structure and system of significations." (64-65). Street vendors, voodoo doctors, brass band marches, large floats, and green and purple beaded necklaces are fused to represent Disney's brand of New Orleans' Mardi Gras. This tradition, which culminates with a grand spectacle of a parade mostly featuring prominent white wealthy men, has been the focus of recent scholarly inquiry (Mitchell 1995; Abrahams et al. 2006; Gaudet and McDonald 2003; Gill 1997). Gill (1997) describes the symbolic importance of Mardi Gras: "In New Orleans, Mardi Gras is a year-round obsession for many people and inspires the fervor of a pagan religion" (4) and notes that it is a "major industry, and helps define the subtle gradations of the city's social and racial caste system." (4). During this time, according to Lipsitz, "New Orleans 'high society' celebrates its blood lines and mythologizes itself as the heir to a powerful tradition of mysticism and magic. The elite mask themselves in expensive costumes and ride motorized floats along the city's main thoroughfares, throwing beaded necklaces and souvenir doubloons to crowds of spectators." (Lipsitz 1988: 115). Eli "Big Daddy" LaBouff represents the city's social and business elite. He stands proxy for the white men who "rode in exclusive parades that dated back to antebellum days and made old-world society look like a hotbed of social mobility. They supervised their daughter's debuts, lived amid the privileges of inherited wealth and regarded themselves as the embodiment of the sacred traditions of New Orleans Carnival" (Gill 1997: 3). For Big Daddy LaBouff, to reign as Rex, King of all Carnival, was a considerable honor that Disney bestowed upon him five times.4 This would be considered "the highest honor of Mardi Gras and the only public one 4 In the film, Tiana congratulates LaBouff for being selected Rex or King of Carnival. LaBouff whispers under his breath, "for the fifth time in a row." Disney takes some creative license here, as Times-Picayune reporter Mike Scott notes. He writes that "that it would be impossible for the same person to be the 'king of the Mardi Gras parade' five years in a row, as is the case with actor John Goodman's character in the movie. 'The' Mardi Gras parade, the Krewe of Rex, just doesn't work that way." See Mike Scott (2009). http://www.nola.com/rnovies/index.ssf72009/12/the_princess_and_the_frog_refl.html Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">436 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 available to a krewe member. Save for identifying Rex each year, the old-line krewes adhered to a code of silence" (Gill 1997: 7-8).5 Per tradition, on the morning of Mardi Gras, the identity of Rex would be revealed on the front page of the Times-Picayune. Later that evening, Rex would be delivered on the Mississippi by a Coast Guard cutter, escorted by a flotilla of riverboats. Rex would disembark, greeted by fireworks and city officials, including the mayor and members of the consular corps. The mayor would declare the next day (Mardi Gras) a holiday and "whimsically turned all his powers over to Rex for the next day. After the ceremony (a nineteenth-century custom revived in 1986), everyone paraded informally along the streets, or 'second-lined,' to meet up with the Proteus parade, which was always held the night before Mardi Gras" (Gill 1997: 8-9). Disney inverts this tradition by replacing Rex with Prince Naveen, both on the cover of the Times-Picayune and by having him appear as royalty on the cruiser, met by adoring fans. Naveen immediately sheds his royal clothes, blends in with the masses, and participates in the second line. He comes to New Orleans seeking to preserve his (colonial) way of life by marrying a princess.6 The life he finds seductive is the jazz life ("When I'm myself again, I want just the life I had/When I'm human, and I'm gonna be, I'm gonna tear it up like I did before/ And that's a royal guarantee"). The audience learns early that Naveen has been disinherited because he wants to live "freely". By the end, he ultimately winds up refusing "freedom" when he marries Tiana and learns to "work" in her restaurant (with the assumed blessings of his mother and father, queen and king of the fictional land Maldonia). Disney also reinstates the colonial presence subtly by changing the name of Tiana's restaurant from Tiana's Place to Tiana's Palace.7 Racial inversion is also accomplished, following "Transformation Central" when Naveen and his British butler trade bodies. Naveen, Prince of the fictional land of Maldonia, is initially cast as a race-neutral person. Since occupying a position of race neutrality is ideologically impossible, Disney "gives" him a race by having Lawrence take his place. Lawrence performs in "blackface" as Naveen with a British colonial accent. 5 Old-line krewes were the remaining vestiges of the white male establishment. "The most venerable was Comus, which first took to the streets in 1857, followed in 1872 by Rex and Momus and, in 1882, by Proteus. Membership in any one of those krewes carried considerable social cachet. Blacks, women, Jews, and anyone of Italian heritage were personae non gratae, although Rex, the largest of the elite organizations, had fallen victim to a creeping liberalism, allowing nouveaux riches and even a few whose Gentile credentials were questionable to infiltrate its ranks. The scions of the old plutocracy in Comus, Momus, and Proteus were more persnickety and still capable of rejecting otherwise respectable candidates for membership if their forbears had been 'scalawags,' as collaborators with federal troops were known during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Comus, Momus, and Proteus tended to dismiss Rex as "down the line socially"" (Gill 1997: 7). According to Albert Memmi's The Colonizer and the Colonized , "The typical colonizer (a male) views his mission as 'simply a voyage towards an easier life' (3); he finds that life seductive in its pleasures, and has difficulty leaving for home. He succeeds in the colony 'by upsetting the established rules and substituting his own.' (9) but he ultimately faces two choices: to 'refuse' or to 'accept' his role" (as quoted in Ball 1997: 176). 7 My thanks to Malachi Gregory for pointing out the graphical alteration. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 437 Historically, blackface was a staple of American culture through the performances of whites "corked up"8 The tradition blended the ideals of miscegenation and racial cross-dressing, and Disney inserts both of these into this film. By allowing Lawrence to perform Naveen in "blackface", Disney gives Naveen a rite of passage from immigrant other to becoming "American" (with a British accent). What might have been read as a bold, albeit less controversial, portrayal of miscegenation (the colored Naveen and Miss Charlotte) was made palatable since the audience "knows" that Naveen is really Lawrence. Disney's Second Line: Masking Race, Making Gumbo Even though the demographic patterns of New Orleans encouraged interracial liaisons, the LaBouff masquerade ball sets the (racial) tone for the rest of the movie. Public masked balls (in contrast to LaBoufFs private affair) were once a fixture of New Orleans life under French colonial rule. Masked balls were outlawed in the mid- 1790s following a period where "New Orleans was rife with demonstrations and near riots inspired by French Revolutionary propagandists and the local authorities were terrified at the prospect of slave revolts and the possibility of [a] French invasion" (Couch 1994: 407). Once the Spanish took control of Louisiana, they made masked balls political because of the problem posed by potential integration of whites with masked free people of color or slaves (Couch 1994: 419). Couch (1994) insists that masked balls were useful and served a purpose in New Orleans. "They found that such balls filled certain needs and satisfied certain longings," Couch argues. "One characteristic of New Orleans throughout its history has been a decided, and probably unique, tendency to mix together - within the city's public culture - people from all walks of life, from all social classes, ethnic backgrounds, and races." (82). In The Princess and the Frog , Disney uses the masquerade ball to fill certain twenty-first century needs (i.e., racial and class mixture as well as an appetite for festival) while also reasserting a racial hierarchy. Whiteness is embedded as the norm through masquerade, especially through the traditional representations of the king and princess of Mardi Gras. In the LaBouff masquerade ball, Eli greets a senator and other local dignitaries. Most of the attendees are costumed and masked with the noted exceptions of Charlotte and Eli (the hosts of the ball) and the black attendees. The band performers and Tiana are not masked, reflecting local law that prohibited blacks from covering their faces. At the end of the scene, we realize that Dr. Facilier has broken with custom and law, hiding behind a white Janus-faced mask. Disney maintains the rituals of European masquerade during the ball, with Charlotte LaBouff at the center. The rhythm of the film revolves around the benevolence of 8 Prior to the Civil War, cultural representations of blackness in the North and South were primarily minstrel shows that depicted white interpretations of slave songs. "Performed during the initial years only by white men in black-face makeup, (who claimed they were singing 'genuine Negro songs in Negro dialect,') the minstrel show, in the words of historian Robert Toll, "literally swept the nation in the 1840s, from White House to the California gold fields, from New Orleans to New England, from riverboats and saloons to 2500 seat houses. For over half a century it remained the most popular entertainment form in the country"" (Franklin 1984: 35). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">438 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 Charlotte's character: Charlotte hires Tiana to cater the ball, allowing Tiana to earn enough to place a down payment for her restaurant; Charlotte performs the role of "princess", dancing in the arms of Lawrence in blackface,9 while Tiana is sidelined first as the caterer and then as a frog. Charlotte will be married on the Mardi Gras float. As frogs, Tiana and Naveen must reach Charlotte before midnight on Mardi Gras for the "princess" kiss that will reverse the spell. Charlotte was the original princess, not Tiana. Tiana only became a princess at the very end after she married the frog/prince. Despite Charlotte's substitution, the film suggests that the audience is to embrace Tiana as a black princess. Tiana is New Orleans' native daughter, with "her hometown's food and music in her veins." (Persali 2009) At the beginning of the movie, Tiana shouts out of her back door, "Hey Everyone! I made gumbo!" Tiana "makes gumbo" throughout the movie, becoming a symbol of it herself by marrying the race-neutral Naveen and bringing together a variety of races and classes under the roof of her restaurant. In Disney's Mardi Gras New Orleans, all cultural distinctiveness is seemingly melted together. The connection of New Orleans culture with gumbo figures prominently in scholarly research, music, and popular culture. The gumbo metaphor is usually invoked to suggest that New Orleans is a melting pot. Ned Sublette (2008) disrupts this notion: Gumbo is not mush. Flavors and essences fuse, but you can tell whether you're biting into shrimp or sausage. Consigning the unknowable to gumbo when talking about music and history is too often a way of throwing up our hands and not inquiring further. There's a frustrating amount that we don't know - and a lot of myth, misinformation, and even disinformation - but Louisiana is not all that unknowable. Nor is gumbo a vague way of saying multicultural. . . in Louisiana, gumbo means a stew served over rice. (Subtlette 2008: 117) Disney's gumbo represents its Utopian vision of a colorblind New Orleans which blends individuals from different cultures, races, and classes who are able to live and play together. Disney infuses its colorblind message in the body of a voodoo priestess, Mama Odie. Mama Odie is blind, living as a maroon deep in the bayou in harmony with a variety of swamp creatures. Disney gifts Mama Odie with "vision" that transcends color and class. Mama Odie's gospel-inspired theme song "Dig a Little Deeper" pushes Tiana to follow her heart as well as her dream. In fact, Mama Odie admonishes both frogs to strive for balance (she encourages Naveen to have more self-control and Tiana to open her heart to love). Mama Odie sings: Don't matter what you look like Don't matter what you wear, How many rings you got on your finger We don't care, No!, We don't care! Don't matter where you come from Don't even matter what you are A dog, A Pig, A Cow, A Goat We got 'em all in here! 9 Although Naveen is a race "neutral" character, I claim that Lawrence is performing blackface when he is transformed into Naveen. Springer</page><page sequence="8">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432^149 439 Again, Disney inverts the second line tradition by asking its audience to "dig a little deeper" and try to move beyond race by accepting Tiana into its family of princesses. At the same time, it consoles the audience - through its visual text and cultural sentimentality - that social reality would not be changing too much. This song encourages the audience to go beyond what they "see", which thinly veils its appeal toward colorblind ideology. Mama Odie's bathtub gumbo represents the portal through which Tiana and Naveen see how they can reclaim their humanity. When We're Human: Representing Blackness, Reproducing Whiteness The idea of humanity is a central theme in Disney movies. "No truths contained in Disney films," Brode (2005) claims, "are more significant than the teaching of tolerance and acceptance through a heightened understanding for the full range of diversity among members of the human race." (17). He argues that "Mickey could be read either way, as an image of what is specifically meant to be American or what it universally meant to be human" (Brode 2005: 18). The audience is left to infer that blacks are other than human. Even though we never actually "see" this in the film, Disney tries to show how blacks existed and learned to improvise under the condition of being deemed less than human. The beginning of the movie lays the ground for Disney's main message: that blacks are decent, honorable, loving and hard working people, and there is something of value that can be learned from black culture. In The Princess and the Frog , Tiana learns what it means to live like something she detests the most - a frog.10 She gets to live with mucous skin, a zapping tongue, and an uncontrollable urge for insects. Here, Disney's message is one of empathy: how can different groups of people learn from each other by "walking in the other person's shoes." After Tiana becomes a frog, she is joined by nonhuman companions who escort her through the beautiful but dangerous Bayou.11 Louis the alligator and Raymond the Cajun firefly play instrumental roles in moving the plot along, helping the audience to laugh, and connecting music with the quest for humanity. When Tiana and Naveen become frogs and are dumped in the middle of the gator ridden Bayou, the audience loses touch with "humanity" for a while. The Bayou is imaginatively reconstructed as a beautiful, yet dangerous place, particularly for a couple of frogs. When Louis the alligator approaches the frog's raft, things do not look good for them. Louis is drawn to the strumming of Naveen's improvised ukulele and immediately brings up his horn to play "Dippermouth Blues" with Naveen. Naveen connects with Louis instantly: "Play it brother!" Louis responds in kind: "Where you been all my life?!" The two are brought together, 10 Many blogs have criticized the movie for erasing Tiana as a "black" princess for the majority of the movie. I argue that this is one of the ways that Disney tried to get people to think about its racial message without staring it directly in the face. For examples, see Jack and Jill Politics' "The Princess and the Frog: Positive or Negative?" (http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/2009/12/the-princess-the-irog-positive-or-negative/); Turner's (2009) Two Cents; Acting White, Acting Black's "Acting White: Disney's Black Princess Kisses White Frog" (http://actingwhite.blogspot.eom/2009/03/acting-white-disneys-black-princess.html). 1 1 Nonhuman familiars often accompany Disney's other princess protagonists (i.e., Mulan's puppy, the black horse Khan, the dragon-lizard Mushu, and the cricket; Snow White's birds and forest creatures).

Louis gives a sense of how he cut his chops: "Why, the bayou's the best jazz school in the world. All the greats play the riverboats. Oh, Louis would give anything to be up there jamming with the big boys." When asked why he did not join them, he said, "I tried. It didn't end well." Singing "When We're Human", Louis the alligator expresses how he desperately wants to be human so he could sit in with a jazz band. On the steamboat, jazz players masqueraded as animals, which allowed Louis to pass as a jazz performer and join in. Louis joins the anthropomorphic voices of Tiana and Naveen, all singing about their desires to become human again. This song is on the surface about them reaching Mama Odie and reversing the curse of Dr. Facilier. But upon further reflection, it can be read as a song about the claim for black humanity. Even though Jim Crow tries to masquerade itself in The Princess and the Frog , racial segregation was at its highest point for black communities in the south in the 1920s. While it is certainly beyond the scope of a children's movie, it is important in this essay to contextualize the reality of the racial hierarchy that existed in 1925. At the height of the "Jazz Age", blacks were denied political, economic, and social opportunities and were constitutionally defined as second-class citizens. Prior to this, in 1890, New Orleans passed a code that segregated railcars and public transportation (early in the movie, we glimpse Eudora escorting Tiana to the back of the railcar after working in the LaBouff mansion). This case led to the infamous Plessey v. Ferguson Supreme Court case in 1896, which upheld the separate but equal clause for the next 50 plus years. After the national government removed its presence following Reconstruction, blacks developed creative strategies in order to survive and protect themselves from Jim Crow apartheid. During this period, when jazz was "born", it and black culture became two of the main forms through which blacks could express their humanity. As Robert O'Meally writes, "The sound of the American twentieth century is the jazz line." (O'Meally 1998). While jazz was in its nascence, African-Americans living in New Orleans witnessed the rise of the KKK following the release of the 1915 film Birth of a Nation , based upon the writings of Thomas Dixon, a segregationist and violently anti-Negro Southerner. The film portrayed "a most sordid and obviously distorted story of Negro emancipation, enfranchisement, and debauchery of white woman- hood. And it did more than any other single thing to nurture and promote the myth of black domination and debauchery during Reconstruction" (J. Franklin 1980: 325). Following its release, southern cities saw a dramatic increase in violence against blacks, in the form of lynching, police brutality, and political disenfranchisement.12 In order to show the humanity of blacks, Disney places white characters in the minstrel role, but rather than having them portray blackness, they grossly caricature whiteness. The story means to appeal to all races, by giving blacks someone to look up to and by giving whites humor that is familiar to them, thereby getting the audience to laugh at unrecognizable whiteness (Ray's Cajun accent, Lawrence's British underclass antics, or the frog hunter trio's physical comedy). Against Tiana's pragmatism and "honorable" work ethic, Lottie is portrayed as the spoiled little rich girl who has been baptized in her father's indulgence and steeped in the Southern female cult of domesticity. Back in the bayou, Tiana and Naveen outsmart and 12 See Franklin (1980) and Hunter (1997). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 441 outwit a trio of frog hunters who give the Three Stooges a run for the money. Portrayed against these extremes, blackness is cast quite believably as honest, hardworking, spirited, humble, and quintessentially American. Even though the minstrels are given white faces, "humor exploited racial stereotypes, but it also played with the hypocrisy of racial division, sometimes stopping short of full disclosure, sometimes going all the way" (Rogin 1998: 128). Aside from Tiana, James, and Eudora, Disney's black New Orleans is filled with subpersons, animated caricatures of blackness.13 In the early parts of the movie with the cook, the parading brass performers, and the little wide-eyed dancing boy, Disney portrays blackness in its typical "rhythmic, pulsating, uninhibited" manner (Levine 1998: 437). While Disney nods toward the tradition of minstrelsy, there seems to be no real contradiction for the company in its portrayal of racial stereotypes on the one hand and its assertion of black humanity through jazz on the other hand. Arguably, Disney has a track record of using music to educate and democratize.14 If Disney used Fantasia to make classical music more accessible to the broader public, the company uses The Princess and the Frog to make jazz (and therefore blackness) more accessible to its white audience. Early Disney animations also attempted to make blackness visible by attaching it to black music. In "Steamboat Willie" (1928), Mickey steers a boat through the deep South,15 "singing and humming nineteenth century gospel songs" (Brode 2005: 51). As Brode (2005) notes, "[Early animations] transform, during the short subject, into an early incarnation of twentieth century jazz." In "The Opry House", Mickey performs ragtime for a white audience that seemingly has not been exposed to such music before. They take to it in a big way. In "The Jazz Fool", the Mouse dares enter a suburban neighborhood, bringing soulful music with him, improving the lifestyle immensely." (51). Although Disney gives jazz a central role as the musical anchor for the film, the audience is moved rather quickly through black neighborhoods in the film, with no mention of Storyville or other communities that produced famous jazz performers like Sidney Bechet. Dull shadowed row houses and the Bayou swamp demarcate the landscape outside the colorful French Quarter. Through Disney's iconography of New Orleans, the film does not stop in Tiana's neighborhood for long, thus repeating the same pattern of tourism in the city. As Souther (2007) writes, "It was little consolation for the nearly one-third of New Orleanians who 13 Charles Mills (1998) writes about personhood and what it means to be subperson. Mills defines a subperson as "a human... who, though adult, is not fully a person." (6). A subperson is slightly above non- human animals and inanimate objects. For Mills, the African-American experience was defined under conditions of white supremacy (before and after slavery) in such a way "that white racism so structured the world as to have negative ramifications for every sphere of black life - juridical standing, moral status, personal (racial identity, epistemic reliability, existential plight, political inclusion, social metaphysics, sexual relations, aesthetic worth)" (6). 14 Brode argues that, "the dream for Fantasia was decidedly democratic: to strip away the stigma of "culture" that proved off-putting to the blue-collar audience and reval to them, by marrying such stuff to the antics of the Mouse, that great music was nothing to be afraid of. To borrow a current term and apply it to that situation, Disney set out to demystify symphonic music for those intimidated by it. He believed that what had become the domain of a self-proclaimed elite could, when properly packaged, prove eveiy bit as applealing to the common man." 1 5 Ironically, the movie opens with a clip of Steamboat Willie , which should give the audience some clue as to Disney's project of reproducing a racial era bygone.

Theirs was a New Orleans untouched by the colorful paint, neon signs, and bronze plaques that connote tourism." (811). In the same way that African- Americans rarely feel "welcome in a French Quarter trolled by white tourists" (Souther 2007: 807), Disney does not create a sense of welcome or invitation to learn about black life in New Orleans. Unlike traditional second lines which memorialize key members of certain black communities, Disney's second line takes the audience through the French Quarter into the swamps of the Bayou and back to the French Quarter, with a brief (barely deserving mention) stop in Tiana's black neighborhood. In this sense, Disney does an effective job of erasing blackness all the while rendering it visible in its Tiana character. Almost There?: Blackness Visible and Invisible Again Disney's 2009 The Princess and the Frog has been praised as a classic return to 2-D animation, joining the ranks of profitable princess films, grossing over $200 million domestically and internationally. This movie also marks a break in the company's history of princess films. Tiana joins Disney's slate of animated "princess" characters - Snow White (1937), Cinderella (1950), Aurora (in Sleeping Beauty , 1959), Ariel (in The Little Mermaid , 1989), Belle (in Beauty and the Beast , 1991), Jasmine (in Aladdin , 1992), Pocahontas (1995), and Mulan (1998). Tiana is cast as an unlikely princess: a young black woman living in segregated black New Orleans. In classic Disney style, Tiana is portrayed as one who does not shun hard work, pursuing a goal of owning her own restaurant ( Tiana 's Place). From the outset, Tiana takes on her father's dream of being a restaurateur and imagines her success in terms of wealth and community building. She even places a wish on an evening star, requesting not a prince but rather for the fulfillment of her and her father's dream of owning a restaurant. At the end of the movie, Tiana does get her restaurant. She also gets her Prince and achieves Disney's uplift project of American individualism, romance, and class mobility. Because of past charges of racism and cultural inaccuracies,16 Disney's producers stressed that the filmmakers and everyone working on the film should "get it right".17 After early meetings with Oprah Winfrey and focus groups with African- American viewers, Disney agreed to change the protagonist's name from Maddy to Tiana and cast her as a waitress instead of a chambermaid for Ms. Charlotte. Tiana was meant to embody the spirit of New Orleans - resilient, good spirited, and hardworking. In both the screenwriting and the production of the film, Disney recognized the significance of the first African-American princess and tried to be sensitive to accusations of subtle and blatant racism in previous animated films that represented 16 See Addison's (1993) "Saving Other Women from Other Men" for her discussion of racial stereotyping in Aladdin and Ma's (2000) The deathly embrace for her treatment of Disney's racism in Mulan as examples. 1 7 See http://blog.nola.com/entertainment_impact_tvfilm/print.html?entry=/2009/12/the_princess_and_ the_frog_refl.html. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="12">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432^149 443 blackness in derogatory and stereotypical ways.18 Critics have gone as far to proclaim Disney's racial success with the film.19 In the London Times , Chris Ayres (2009) speculated, "it might be hard for Disney's critics to maintain that the movie is insensitive to blacks when faced with the fact that it was written largely by a black man." Screenwriter Ron Edwards made the following comment on Disney's history of racial missteps: "That was a long time ago, and none of those guys are at the company now." Edwards endeavored to make The Princess and the Frog as "inoffensive as possible", stating that he tried to skirt any explicit references to the racism of the 1920s.20 Edwards used the example of the real estate agents in the film (who were working with Tiana to find a space for her restaurant), as through these agents, the film alluded to racism (the real estate agent tells Tiana that "she doesn't come from a suitable background to run a big business"). Her interaction with the real estate brokers at the ball reinforces the moral code of white supremacy in the film. The real estate agents informed Tiana that she had been outbid for the restaurant and told her that it was probably for the best since she did not come from a "suitable background". For the real estate agents, Tiana's desire to own and operate a restaurant represented a degree of status and success that was deemed inappropriate for blacks, especially for black women. Disney reminds the audience of the distinction between persons and subpersons and that black wealth and black humanity often depended on the benevolence of white people rather than on the merit of blacks.21 From Edwards' perspective, "the forces were against her - it could be sexism, racism, classism. But we didn't want this story to be one that 18 Dumbo was the first feature length film that depicted blacks as the five black crows. The film was widely criticized for its gross characterization of blacks. For Brode, however, caricature should not be the main focus of criticism. He wrote: "While there is an edge of caricature, that ought to be set against Disney's overall approach: Every group, from pretentious pachyderms to crazy clowns, is here caricatured. Disney doesn't pick out blacks alone for burlesque, and in comparison to his vicious ridicule of other constituencies within the film, his treatment of the crows plays as loving satire. The crows do initially laugh at Dumbo, like everyone else. They are, after all, only human, or, more correctly, Disney's anthropomorphic equivalent of humans. Laughing, though, is all that the others do." (Brode 2005: 52). 19 According to Mia Mask of Vassar College: "The reason for the critical silence is the film doesn't fall into the trap that people expected," Mia Mask, the film department chair at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., told ABCNews.com. "Because the film was in production so long, people were expecting (Disney) to mess it up and reproduce stereotypes in some way. But the folks working on this really had a clue and managed to avoid the pitfalls that people expected they might fall into." See http:// abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/princess-frog-disney-movie-hits-notes/story?id=9386673. 20 My issue with this statement is that it presumes that presenting historical accuracy is the same as being offensive. With a careful eye, one does see references to segregation in the film: For example, Tiana and Eudora enter the railcar and sit toward the rear; most of their neighbors are black or brown in the row house community where Tiana grows up; in the restaurant, the white patrons all sit toward the front while the black patrons are at a table in the rear or at the counter. It seems that for Edwards not making explicit reference to Jim Crow or to racism somehow makes it less of an issue. However, skirting around an issue certainly does not make it invisible, nor does it make it less offensive. One could argue that skirting around racism is as offensive - if not more - than providing an accurate representation of life in New Orleans for a black person. 21 George Lipsitz insists that "white opposition to the accumulation of assets by African Americans has a long history, one manifest in a broad range of private and public actions, including discrimination in home lending, employment, and education as well as in racial zoning, restrictive covenants, blockbusting, racially targeted urban renewal, and vigilante violence against people of color who move into white neighborhoods" (Lipsitz, 163-164, Possessive Investment in Whiteness). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">444 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 teaches people about racism. That just doesn't seem to be the thing to do with a Walt Disney princess movie."22 Yet, in Multiculturalism and the Mouse , Douglas Brode makes the case that one of Disney's objectives was precisely "to teach people about racism", just in a way that was approachable and digestible. Brode argues, quite sympathetically toward Disney, that the company "engineered" racial progressivism and civil rights on screen pre- 1960, bringing blacks and whites together in proximity under the safety of film. For Brode, Disney ushered in new ways of imagining tolerance and kinship across racial lines. While Disney did allow certain caricatures to be portrayed, the intent was to subtly undermine them.23 Here, I take a critical position that differs from those of both Brode and Edwards. While much attention was placed on "getting it right" by making the movie as colorblind as possible, little has been said about how race was conceptualized through black womanhood in the film. The majority of black women living in the urban south after the Civil War worked for wages and was primarily confined to domestic labor (Hunter 1997: viii). Black women were located as part of an invisible workforce in the private sphere, primarily in the capacity of cooks, maids, child-nurses, laundresses, and as other specialized servants (Hunter 1997: viii). In To 'Joy My Freedom ', Tera Hunter (1997) states, "Clearly, African-American women were outpowered and outnumbered. They fought for dignity and self-respect and won small gains, moments of reprieve, and symbolic political victories" (viii). Black women's lives were defined not only by their connection to work, struggle, and pain but they also engaged in pleasure activities through neighborhood organizations, families, churches, mutual aid societies, dance halls, and vaudeville theater (Hunter viii). Disney tried quite intentionally to cast Tiana in a way that would "break" certain expectations and stereotypes about black womanhood. A theme is established early in the film that Tiana is exceptional, which I define as24 the display of her early gift for cooking, her hardworking, almost ascetic demeanor that eschews pleasure (i.e., dancing) for working toward a goal. She is the embodiment of black respectability and uplift. In lieu of hanging out with her peers, she keeps her eye on the prize. She is a working class woman, although she embodies Disney's "middle class ideal" of a hardworking citizen, working long hours, preferring saving and delayed gratification, and coming from a two-parent 22 As quoted in Ayres (2009). - Brode even goes so far as to state that Disney the man considered himself more black than white and wanted to show his "progressive" attitude in his cartoons and films. Whether we can leave this job to a multi-conglomerate industry such as Disney is another article, perhaps book. 4 In this essay, I argue that Tiana is characterized as an exceptional black person, due to the way Disney overemphasizes her work ethic, her lack of interest in leisure activities or in finding a "mate". Tim Wise (2009) defines "enlightened exceptionalism" as the act of accommodating "individual people of color, even as it continues to look down upon the larger mass of black and brown America with suspicion, fear, and contempt." (Wise 2009: 23). Wise argues that this suggests a different kind of racism that exists alongside the ongoing traditional white racism. "It indicates," Wise claims, "that far from vanishing, racism has become more sophisticated." In the film, Tiana 's exceptionalism and the practically invisible rendering of the greater black community in the film "still holds the larger black and brown communities of our nation in low regard but is willing to carve out exceptions for those who make some whites sufficiently comfortable" (Wise 2009: 24). Springer</page><page sequence="14">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432^149 445 household. Tiana sings that she's "almost there" as she works two jobs to save money for her own restaurant. Her mother, Eudora, also shows practicality, although ingrained in the image of black womanhood of her own era. She queries Tiana about working too much and about the possibility of her "settling down" and "giving her some grandchildren". This line seems out of place, given the fact that the voice behind Eudora is Oprah Winfrey, philanthropist, television mogul, and self-made billionaire who chose to pursue her career path over "getting married and settling down" despite great public pressure to do so during the 1980s and 1990s.25 The character of Eudora also represents a departure from other Disney princess films. Usually Disney princess movies do not include a mother, so having Eudora as a presence and a voice of encouragement for Tiana is unique. Eudora works for a wealthy white businessman (Eli "Big Daddy" La Bouff) and serves as a surrogate mother to the motherless daughter, Charlotte. The two girls grow up almost like sisters, although in parallel universes: Charlotte is indulged with everything she wants, while Tiana is taught the values of thrift, community, family, and hard work. In an earlier scene in the film, as Tiana and Charlotte listen to Eudora read from The Frog Prince , Charlotte takes every word literally, believing that her wishes on the evening star and even kissing a frog would bring all of her dreams to fruition. Tiana has a look of suspicion and even disgust at the idea of kissing a frog. Her expression underscores Charles Mills' (1998) point that, "those who have grown up in such a universe, asked to pretend that they are not living in the other, will be cynically knowing, exchanging glances that signify "There the white folks go again." They know that what is in the books is largely mythical as a general statement of principles, that it was never intended to be applicable to them in the first place, but that within the structure of power relations, as part of the routine, one has to pretend that it does" (Mills 1998: 4). Tiana and Lottie remain friends throughout the movie, but the audience has a sense of the distance between them wrought by race, class, and the years that have passed. Black girls and white girls might wish on the same star, but they come to expect different outcomes. As Hunter (1997) explains it, black women like Tiana and Eudora "would have to negotiate the literal rough terrain... and the social consequences it imposed on their everyday lives as they struggled to earn a living for their families and searched for peace of mind"(44). For example, as James and little Tiana cook up some gumbo, Eudora is glimpsed at her sewing machine, indicating that she probably took extra jobs home in the evening. In the segregated South, most black men and women shared the burden of wage earning in the household (Hunter, 50). As the young Tiana matures, she replaces her father's income after his death. 25 Trying to reconcile Oprah giving another woman the advice of "finding a prince" in the movie was initially difficult. What I have come to think is that Eudora represented women from the generation who viewed marriage as being in line with black respectability and middle class values. She reminded Tiana at one point that even though her father never realized his dream of owning a restaurant, he had what he "needed". What we are told in the movie is that people, that humans need to love and to be loved. This was valued above everything else - money, honor, or luxury items. This was the pragmatic idea that yes, someday your prince may come and that would be great, but in the mean time, you have to work hard and try to reach your goal despite obstacles that may come your way. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">446 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-^49 The movie was "classic" in its treatment of work, going out of its way to portray African-Americans (especially Tiana) as extremely hardworking. Cameron Turner writes: "Inspired by her parents, Tiana puts in endless hours as a waitress, religiously saving her wages and tips toward the day when she can realize her dad's dream of opening an elegant soul food restaurant. Such diligence and commitment to a goal have been cornerstones of African-American success throughout our obstacle-filled history in the United States. Black folks' willingness to sweat and strain, to endure the degradation of racism and discrimination, to persevere through poverty and to rely on ourselves and each other are the reasons that our people have been able to make a way out of no way, over and over again, from the nightmare time of slavery on up to the present 'Obama Era' with its unprecedented levels of opportunity."26 There is a strong sense in The Princess and the Frog as in earlier Disney produced films that ""The American Dream" - the success ethic that Disney subscribes to- rings true for blacks as well as whites" (Brode 2005: 64). Even though Disney is "almost there" in its portrayal of the connection between blackness and a strong work ethic, the movie still misses one of the nuances of the meaning of "work" in black culture. To illustrate, in one occasion, one of Tiana's friends invites her dancing: "We all going out dancin' tonight. Care to join us?" When Tiana declines because she wants to work extra hours, her friend says, "Girl, all you ever do is work... I told y'all she wouldn't come." Disney makes Tiana exceptional in that she does not partake in any distractions, including dancing, which was a ritual among blacks. Dancing in New Orleans was an expression of freedom, tracing back to the days of slavery. Congo Square was a popular gathering space for black slaves. As Ned Sublette writes, "Dancing went on informally, and the large public gatherings of slaves continued. A visitor to the city in 1799, accustomed to a more sedate Sabbath, was surprised to see, on a Sunday in New Orleans, 'vast numbers of negro slaves, men, women, and children, assembled together on the levee, drumming, fifing, and dancing, in large rings.'" (Subtlette 2008: 175) Black working class life consisted of paid labor as well as consumption, entertainment, and personal gratification (Hunter 1997: 181). Work did not only mean physical labor; the idea of work for blacks also included dancing. According to Hunter, "Dancing enabled a momentary escape from wage work, even as dance itself was considered work - of a different order. The ethics of drive, achievement, and perseverance took on a different meaning when removed from the context of wage relations." (Hunter 1997: 181). Moreover, as Hunter explains, "The value placed on dancing as hard work resonated in particular with African-American women workers in a society in which the highest valorization of womanhood was largely defined by non-work. The ideal woman did not engage in wage work, and the ideal woman's vocation in the home was not considered work" (Hunter 1997: 181). In the film, Charlotte received the valorization of womanhood, dancing the princess dance, while Tiana remained firmly attached to work. Disney's second line fails to successfully incorporate music and dance with the ethic of work. In fact, Disney divorces Tiana's character from the ritual of dancing 26 See Turner's (2009) Two Cents. â Springer</page><page sequence="16">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432^149 447 much the same way it defines her solely by her labor (first as a waitress and in the end as a restaurateur). For Tiana, dancing seems like a distraction rather than as an assertion of her community.27 Tiana's story does not present a counter-narrative that challenges New Orleans racial hierarchy; rather, it tries to situate her firmly within it. As Tiana sings "Almost There" with her new prince/husband, Disney moves her further away from her origins and places her in New Orleans' "high society". Even though Tiana gains the princess crown, she only gains access to resources through the wealth of her husband's family. Thus, Tiana joins the lineage of Disney princesses and continues to reinforce the racial hierarchy of the dominant culture. Conclusion The Princess and the Frog updates Disney's racial discourse to reflect more accurately America's sensibilities about constructions of race, particularly blackness. The movie was successful in blending different facets of New Orleans culture. The focus on detail was apparent throughout the movie, from the ring of the streetcars to the banner line on the local newspaper, The Times-Picayune , to architectural features on the buildings. The film's artists who had studied historical video and photographs from 1920s New Orleans tried to accurately render the iconography of New Orleans, from the streets of the French Quarter to the swamps of the Bayou. New Orleans artists, representing the musical gumbo from jazz to gospel to zydeco, performed the music, written by Randy Newman. The movie also resonates well with African-Americans who have been waiting for an animated depiction of their cultural experiences. Underlying the movie are themes about "respectable" blackness, as portrayed by Tiana's fantastic journey from humble parents voiced by Oprah Winfrey and Terrence Howard to wealthy mansions in the French quarter and then through the swamps of the Bayou. As Cameron Turner blogs, "For black adults (particularly our elders who recall firsthand the bad oP days before the Civil Rights Movement), watching a huge Disney cartoon spectacular about an admirable, beautiful and identifiable black woman was truly a fairy tale come true."28 Michael Rogin (1998) wrote, "When American film takes its great leaps forward, it returns to its buried origins" (17). While the dialogue and musical numbers suggest that the audience is to accept Disney's updated colorblind message (and taste its gumbo), the impressive images and backdrop of masquerade suggests the opposite. Disney's attempt to render blackness visible and human must be read against its objective of maintaining whiteness in the movie. Despite Edwards' claim that Disney never intends to "teach people about racism", I argue that indeed The Princess and the Frog does. Food and jazz share the burden of serving as metaphors for colorblindness and black humanity, leaving the audience with a feeling of 27 Tiana was hesitant to engage in "dancing" in the movie, with the exception of the frog dance with Naveen. She did, however, indulge in dancing in her restaurant dream. In her dream dance, she sheds the waitress uniform, leaving "the sartorial symbols of servility for garments that reflected personal style and self-worth" (Hunter, 182). 28 See Turner's (2009) Two Cents. Springer</page><page sequence="17">448 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:432-449 accomplishment that they have moved beyond race in their acceptance of Tiana as a princess. As the world remains enraptured by two little brown girls living under the roof of the White House, Disney manages to reassure its mainstream audience, through its second line, that while we now have a "new" princess, the existing hierarchy with whiteness at its helm remains firmly in place.
