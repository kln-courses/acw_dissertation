<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Workshop of Pere Abadai Immaculada Sócias In seventeenth-century Catalonia there were some prominent woodcut makers such as Llorenç Deu (c. 1580-1648) and Joan Jolis (1675-1705). The most prominent and outstanding among them, however, was Pere Abadai, both for the quality and quantity of his work.1 His achievement surpasses by far the rest of the Spanish woodcut artists whose work is known today. Abadai made his prints between 1650 and 1684 in his workshop in Moià, Barcelona, and was the patriarch of a prolific line of printmakers that later branched off to different areas of the country (Igualada, Mataró, Puigcerdà). His descendants estab- lished very productive workshops, which lasted well into the twentieth century. A surprising aspect of Abadal's professional career is that while he worked as a printmaker, he also managed a store that sold goods from the Spanish colonies. This dual occupation was not, however, infrequent at the time. Duchartre recalls that in France, as well as in Spain, the production of woodcuts brought in limited income, which made employment in other fields nec- essary.2 In fact, it is very likely that Abadai acquired more income and social prestige as the purveyor of colonial goods than as a printmaker. This seems to be evidenced by the fact that the signature on his prints almost always includes both his name and his occupa- tion as tradesman. Abadal's workshop was essentially a family craft business, dedicated to the printing of books and prints that were frequently painted in bright and attractive colours. The excellence of these prints brought his . workshop well-deserved fame, and its reputation spread throughout the country. His two sons, Josep (1660-1749) and Pau (1663-1729), followed in their father's footsteps as printmakers, although neither attained his skill in the graphic medium. Likewise, although both produced numerous prints, they mostly distributed their father's work, because it was the best and most sought after. Pere Abadal's work includes a corpus of some 300 prints. Most are of religious subjects, because the majority of requests for them came from churches, chapels, religious brotherhoods and convents from practically the entire country. It must be pointed out, however, that his work also included impressive secular prints, such as almanacs, zodiac cards, bestiaries, bal- lads, and so on. But the outstanding reputation and fame of the Moià workshop was surely due to one of Abadal's important accomplishments, the production of albums of woodcuts. These were framed with beau- tiful and well-crafted floral borders, and were likely to be hung in homes because of their beauty and appeal. Although very few copies exist of such albums created in the seventeenth century, the magnificent Abadai Album, a rare volume created in the eighteenth century, has survived. It is made up of 177 prints, most of them signed by Pere Abadai. The collection, which was made available to his clients, provides us with interesting information about market demands, the type of iconography that was sought after and the Abadai workshop's radius of operation.3 As is well known, these woodcut workshops rarely created their own images, and instead tended to base them on other printed sources. The understanding of these sources is of very great interest, because among other things they account for the relationship between the main printing distribution centres and the periph- eral ones. A good place to begin a study of the sources used by Abadai is an analysis of three of his prints of various animals. Since earliest times, fauna have been present in art and literature, and each period has given images of animals symbolic value. Because of the geographical discoveries and explorations of the seven- teeth and eighteenth centuries, however, animal prints enjoyed extraordinary popularity. A common denomi- nator of many of these prints is that they are codified from a metonymical, analogical or metaphorical point of view, in other words, they use attributes, symbols or i. I.

All three are signed by Pere Abadai. This is an exception to the norm, since woodcuts of this type were usually anonymous. The cherrywood plates6 for these prints are still in existence - an unusual occurrence - and still bear the original inscriptions, retouched because of their frequent use by Abadal's descendants throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In The Parrot , the bird may be observed in delicate profile, resting on a tree branch7 (fig. 198). The print offers a detailed network of thick and thin lines of remarkable simplicity and subtlety. The cartouche, framed by graceful foliate decoration, suggests that women's essential nature is to be inane chatterboxes, metaphysically reflected in the illogical discourse of a parrot: Dos cosas son de estima Y ab rao La dona quant es callada y lo papagall xarrado. Such rare and exotic animals are often seen in the European ornamental repertoire from the sixteenth century on, especially in the œuvres of Dutch and Flemish artists.8 Although we still do not know what sources were available to Abadai, it is likely that he had in his workshop, among other collections, prints from the very famous Historiae Animalium by the naturalist Konrad Gesner (15 16-65), 9 or treatise by Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605)10 (fig. 199). The second print, of The Cat and the Mouse" enjoyed wide circulation in Europe during the seventeenth cen- tury. The rotund figure of the feline holding a rodent in its mouth occupies the entire compositional space (fig. 200). Its realistic likeness is accomplished by a simple but convincing technique. The action is conveyed in the caption: Lo gat qui menge lo rat. No doubt the original source of the print was the famous Cat depicted in Gesner's treatise (fig. 203), which had been distributed throughout Europe, Spain, Italy, England12 (fig. 201) and distant Russia (fig. 202).

The subject is an anthropomorphic being with an extremely long neck and equine ears.

C° Nicolo Osdrino vicino . . . in mese di Febraio Vanno 1664 ... a donare a su Maesta Cesarea. This legend, which the printmaker surprisingly leaves untranslated, is evidence of its Italian source. Although I have not found the direct source of this hyperbolic figure, a German engraving that helps to explain it15 is the marvellous print by Johann Hoffman16 (fig. 205), who achieved a very dra- matic representation of the Tartar, omitting any sec- ondary detail that might have distracted attention from the power that emanates from the image.17 The inscrip- tion at the foot of this print reads: Dis ist Tarter den der Herz Gr av. Nicolaus von Serin gefangen bekommen Anno 1664. Like the inscription on Abadal's woodcut, this refers to the capture of the Tartar by Count Nicholas Serin. He can be identified with Nicola Osdrino on the Catalan print, thanks to German sources that reveal the various spellings of Serin, such as Zriny, Zrin, Serini, Zerin, Zrio, Zrinio and Osdrino.18 As is well known, during the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries the Turks, also referred to as Ottomans and Tartars, expanded into the Danube Basin, the Near East and the Mediterranean region. In the year 1664 a memorable battle was fought between Turks and Christians in the territory of Croatia, in which Count Nicolas Serin (1620-64), an imperial sol- dier who helped to win the victory for the Christian hosts of the German Emperor Leopold I, His Majesty of Caesarea,19 took an active part. In addition to being a valiant warrior, the Count distinguished himself in the field of literature by his heroic poems,20 giving us 205. Johann Hoffman, The Tartar , 1664, engraving, 243 x 170 mm (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale). reason to think that he may have been the one who circulated the story of the Tartar, and created the legend in order to promote his own glory and fame. 15.

I assume that the abbreviation HofFm. corresponds to the German sur- name of Hoffman, which is often spelled with two 'f's. Perhaps it could be Johann Jacob Hoffmann, who created prints on the subject of Turks in Vienna during the last third of the seven- teenth century.

On the other hand, it is possible that in the Ottoman army there was a person of remarkable physique and abilities, whose fame, embellished by the collective imagination, was transformed into an epic tale and spread throughout Europe in the form of prints, oral narratives and literary texts, which fed the taste for the marvellous and the extravagant that was prevalent on the Continent at that time. This very theme was picked up by an English literary source, which tells of a London fair at which bizarre and unusual beings were exhibited to satisfy public curiosity. Among them, the source relates, was none other than the very famous Tartar captured by Count Serini: A number of giants and prodigies were exhibited in London in the seventeenth century, and James Paris de Plessis, in his short History of Human Prodigies records several that he actually saw. Among them was a 'Monstrous Tartar' who came from Hungary, who was to be at 'Ye Globe' in the ould Abaily in February 1664. He was taken prisoner by Count Serini and was a creature of extraordinary strength and valour, who having spent all his arrows in fight against Christian, was taken alive and so continues being carefully kept in those parts.21 This convincing literary testimony, and the existence of the prints, leads one to think that the phenomenon of The Tartar was part of the collective imagination of the time for two fundamental, although complemen- tary, reasons: first, because the prints fed the passion for marvellous and extraordinary events, and second, because it was a reference to the danger posed by the Turks in many areas of Europe. 21.

As mentioned above, religious prints take primary place in Pere Abadal's work. Many were related to French, Italian and Flemish sources. In France, the productive workshops of the rue Saint Jacques22 were the suppliers for numerous European regions, among them the Catalan market. Some of their most distin- guished representatives were Nicolas Langlois (1640-?) and Pierre Landry (1630-1701), who not only published well-known Renaissance and Baroque prints, but also distributed traditional and popular ones, such as those that might have been of particular interest to Abadai. Duchartre and Saulnier designate these prints as imagerie de la rue Saint- Jacques™ Nevertheless, the French prints24 had to compete with Italian ones, and with Flemish engravings by the Wierix and Collaert workshops that were also used in Abadal's atelier. The artists from these, like the French and Italians, not only distributed their own pictures, but also played the important rôle of intermediaries by transcribing picto- rial representation into the linear treatment required by engravings. This step was vital for the woodcut artists, who were the final link in the chain.25 The extraordinary circulation of these sources resulted in the appearance of a koine of common denominators in European graphic culture. In com- paring two prints of Saint George, for instance, the hero of Cappadocia is seen in both, lance at the ready, forcefully piercing the mouth of the horrid monster. The first print is French and is signed with the initials JJV:26 (fig. 207), while the second is by Pere Abadai (fig. 22. I.

Pere Abadai, Santa Catalina , woodcut, 299 x 198 mm (Barcelona, Biblioteca de Catalunya). 206). The similarity between the two is truly surprising. Although in the Catalan woodcut the artist may have opted for a few minor variations, such as including a kneeling princess and eliminating the trees that frame the scene, his reliance on the French print cannot be denied. Abadai even left the caption, S. George , in French. In the case of the Burgundian print of Le Bon Ange Gardien21 (fig. 208), Abadai again followed the French source closely, although he opted for simplifying the composition by eliminating four lateral vignettes, giv- ing priority to the round central image of the angel 211.

One of the many examples of the partial use of a print is Abadal's adaptation of Collaerťs S. Fulgentìus 28 (fig. 210). Abadai has borrowed the figure of the king and inserted it next to the figure of Santa Catalina (fig. 211). Thus, engravings provided an endless pool of composi- tional resources for the woodcut artist. Another common practice, in certain ways related to the above, was the use of moulds, which resulted • in considerable savings for the woodcut workshop, because a single block generated two different prints. This was done by means of a series of devices that allowed for multiple uses of the moulds, by inserting interchangeable heads or different attributes that fitted together in spaces deliberately left blank.29 There are several examples of these from Abadal's workshop. One of the more representative is a print of Santa Tecla of c. 1685 (fig. 212), patron saint of the city of Tarragona, by Josep Abadai, Pere 's older son, who continued the family workshop. The saint holds a tau cross in her right hand,30 a symbol that also appears in the upper portion of the print, while in her left she shows the palm representing her martyrdom.

The two lions allude to Tecla's martyrdom. When this print is compared with that of Santa Bárbara , patron saint of the artillery corps (fig. 213), we can see that the image is exactly the same, although some of the symbols have been modified: the tau in her right hand has been exchanged for a fortress and the lions for a cannon. A different problem of sources is raised by one of Abadal's famous woodcuts, San Narciso y el milagro de las moscas (St Narcissus and the Miracle of the Flies' fig. 214), and its relationship with paintings on the same subject. According to pious legend, St Narcissus protected the city of Girona from attacks by French troops several times. From his grave, the saint caused some flies to appear that viciously attacked the French, forcing their sudden retreat. This miracle has often found expres- sion in the visual arts, especially since the seventeenth century. One of the best examples is the famous paint- ing of San Narciso y el milagro de las moscas in the Colegiata de San Feliu in Girona (fig. 217). It is probable that this picture, donated in 1675 byjosep Fageda, former Bish- op of Girona, had an immediate and significant impact on the region's graphic workshops, as exemplified by 218.

Although this painting has always been cited as the source for Abadal's print, if we compare the two we see that even though the action is the same and takes place in the saint's chapel in both versions, there are signifi- cant compositional differences. These may be due to the existence of a print or drawing, now unknown, to which Abadai had access. What we can assume is that Abadai did not directly copy the painting, because woodcut artisans usually lacked the technical expertise necessary to convert pictorial values to the graphic medium. A similar situation can be seen in other prints, one of them made in 1691 by Francese Gazán31 (fig. 216), and a second one (fig. 215) attributed to the same engraver, who probably used a copy of a copy of 31.

But the fame of the San Narciso y el milagro de las moscas is not only reflected in the prints, but in other paintings as well, such as the one by an unknown artist in the Museo Diocesano in Girona (fig. 218). This painting, which is qualitatively much inferior to the San Feliu version, has had a sad history. At a certain point it was retired from religious use, taken from its frame and carelessly folded, leaving creases on the painted sur- face. Yet in this worn and forgotten painting we have been able to find a number of similarities with Abadal's woodcut, such as the movements of the troops and of the Virgin and Child. These formal connections raise questions about which of the paintings was the prima- ry source, as well as pointing to the complex relation- ships between painting and print. Finally, some prints that are exceptional both for their large format (480 x 565 mm) and for their techni- cal excellence, are the Novísimos or Postrimerías ( The Four Last Things [Death, Purgatory, Hell and Glory]). Two by Abadai are dated 1684, while two others of the same period are anonymous. Their iconographie structure is based on a book by the theologian Magi</page><page sequence="16">400 PERE ABADAL 221.

The prints give a specific number for each symbol, matching the verses of Cases's work. In the Novísimo Primero , Death, on horseback, blandish- es his two scythes and tramples on skeletons. Death divides the figurative space into two paths: one presided over by the Prince of Eternal Light and the other by the Prince of Darkness. Along the road to sal- vation are three knights; the first carries a bow, the sec- ond a sword and the third a set of scales. On the road to perdition is a man on the rump of a seven-headed dragon, as well as a personification of the world crowned by grape leaves - a clear reference to Dionysian pleasures - who is holding a drum (fig. 219). In the Novísimo Segundo , the Judge of the Living and the Dead is followed by his retinue. On the left is a 32. M.

In the upper right-hand cor- ner are three circles, with inscriptions that refer to a series of allegorical personifications, while on the left is a large group of people with phylacteries inscribed 'rigour', 'vengeance' and 'justice' (fig. 220). In the Novísimo Tercero , the space is divided into seven vignettes, each corresponding to a punishment. The door to Hell is represented (along the right edge) by a huge monster with a gaping mouth, which is the open- ing to the infernal Babylon (fig. 221). The Novísimo Cuarto is organized in to four large bands, in which the chosen ones form a long procession, enjoying a beatif- ic vision of God and His celestial host. Glory is repre- sented as a closed, walled space, a clear reference to the Heavenly Jerusalem (fig. 222). The particular circumstances that inspired Abadai to create these large prints are unknown, but we do know of the contractual documents concerning the other Postrimería prints done by Joan Jolis, another seven- teenth-century Barcelona printmaker, although the resulting woodcuts have not been located. The contract is none the less interesting and informative, because it describes the conditions under which this type of print was contracted, while at the same time reflecting their extraordinary success and wide circulation.</page><page sequence="18">402 PERE ABADAL 223. Madeleine Cochin-Hortemels, Le Chanteur de Cantiques , 1777, etching and engraving, 240 x 186 mm (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale). In 1683 a contract was drawn up between Magi Cases and Joan Jolis for prints illustrating Four Last Things - the Novísimos. 33 Jolis received the 'polished and drawn' plates ready for engraving, with a month and a half in which to execute each. Abadai, in addition to being an excellent woodcut artist, fully understood the process of printmaking, whereas Jolis evidently did not enjoy similar talents, and Magi Cases was aware of this when he provided the craftsman with blocks already bearing drawings and ready to be cut. The document also establishes the price of the four Novísimos blocks: eight gold doubloons. Our valuation today of woodcuts as popular prints leads us to think that materials were not expensive in those days. To engrave a metal plate may have been more expensive than one in wood, but the latter was not cheap either. It was expensive to publish an illustrated book, although most publishers did not hesitate to invest in prints because they knew that they would eventually make a profit.34 Magi Cases therefore paid the engraver a considerable price, knowing that success was assured. We can assume that it was the great popularity of these prints that motivated Abadai to print his Novísimos in 1684. Within the Catalan production of graphic works, these prints are exceptional for their size, although they are not unique. There are other notable examples from this period, such as the Arbor Vitae , a monumental work as much for its size as its artistic importance. This print was commissioned by the Dominican Convent of Santa Catalina in Barcelona from the Flemish work- shop of the Galles,35 in order to distribute and dissemi- nate the. rosary prayers to Mary. The large graphic format of these prints must be related to their function. Because they were planned and designed with an ideological/religious purpose, for a mostly illiterate population, the image was predominant. An eight- eenth-century engraving, the Chanteur de Cantiques by Madeleine Cochin-Hortemels36 (Paris, 1686-1767), perfectly contextualizes the significance of these large prints. In it, the chanteur recites the text out loud, while indicating different passages with a pointer to his het- erogeneous, inattentive audience (fig. 223). It demon- strates how this type of print played an important and influential rôle, by suggesting guidelines for behaviour that affected a broad social spectrum and contributed to its cohesion. 33. I.
