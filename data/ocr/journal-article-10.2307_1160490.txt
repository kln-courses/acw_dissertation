Although the experience of civilian government in Nigeria has not been a particularly lengthy one-the tenure of the two republics accounts for only about ten of the twenty-eight years since independence-it has provided sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the workability of democratic institu- tions. Rule by the politicians has come to be associated with spectacular economic mismanagement, corruption and a style of political competition often approximating to open warfare. The failings of the politicians have dominated the periods of military rule as well, partly because military governments have needed a foil for their own shortcomings and partly because the legacy of political and economic decay has been a real one. At a time when the Babangida administration is laying the foundations for another return to civilian rule in 1992, there is an obvious temptation to examine the historical record for clues as to what the future might hold. While a vast amount of time and paper is consumed in the effort to 'get the constitution right', it is necessary at least to consider the possibility that there are aspects of the Nigerian social structure which are inimical to liberal democracy. Although none of the books under review was written with 1992 explicitly in mind, each in its own way sheds some light on the problem. The volumes of Diamond and Joseph, which deal with the events leading up to the collapse of the First and Second Republics respectively, both set out in search of the 'fundamental processes' underlying Nigerian politics. The book by Miles is, despite its title, a rather less ambitious work, consisting essentially of the author's observations on the 1983 elections in a remote Hausa community. At another level of abstraction entirely, Ihonvbere and Shaw are concerned less with the 'superstructural' dimensions of Nigerian politics than with the wider political economy of a state suddenly bestowed with the dubious bounties of the oil boom. The questions which this article levels at the books under consideration are: first, what were the core reasons for the collapse of the two republics; and, second, how amenable are these factors likely to be to constitutional fine-tuning? The short answer to the first of these, which emerges from a</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLE reading of both Diamond and Joseph, is that the rules of the political game were trampled underfoot as political rivals resorted to every means at their disposal to gain a decisive advantage. Indeed, the sequence of events which led up to the overthrow of the Balewa and Shagari administrations was surprisingly similar. In each case the party in control of the centre appeared to resort to questionable methods to dislodge its opponents from their bases of power: hence the virtual elimination of the Action Group in the Western Region over 1962-63 and the impeachment of Balarabe Musa as the PRP governor of Kaduna State in 1981. In each case the final act before the curtain fell was a hopelessly rigged election followed by a spiral of political violence, which the federal government seemed unable to contain. Moreover, formally impartial institutions, such as the courts and the electoral commissions, became deeply embroiled in the political melee at some cost to their own autonomy. However, the short answer clearly begs the question of why political competition became so uncompromising at all. In their respective attempts to probe beyond appearances, Diamond and Joseph both suggest that the answer lies in the interaction of class and ethnicity. The ethnic factor has always loomed large in political analysis of the First Republic. This is hardly surprising given the language of political campaign- ing at the time and the outbreaks of ethnic violence, notably the pogroms against Ibos in the north, which followed the coup. However, there is some disagreement on the independent weight to be attached to the ethnic factor. On the one hand, the largely journalistic accounts of the period treated ethnicity as a structural fault running through the society, which constantly threatened to bring the political edifice crashing down. On the other hand, academic analysis has often treated ethnicity as an outward symptom of a deeper malaise. The extreme statement of this position was provided by Richard Sklar (1967) who argued that tribalism in Africa was often a 'mask for class privilege'. Larry Diamond, whose book constitutes a useful synthesis of the voluminous secondary literature, follows closely in the second of these traditions. This is not to accuse the author of treating ethnicity as a mere epiphenomenon. Indeed, his attempt to situate the clash of identities in the different historical traditions of the major groups, the colonial legacy and the impact of 'modernisation' is in many respects a subtle one. Particular blame is attached to the unbalanced federal system inherited at independence: that is, a federation with too few regions; where regional and ethnic boundaries (with the exception of the minorities) reinforced each other; and where one region was larger than the other two together. However, in the final analysis, Diamond falls back upon the argument that ethnicity derived its salience from the willingness of politicians to play the tribal card: In their competition for the resources of class formation, the politicians of the First Republic channelled their conflict into Nigeria's main line of social division, ethnicity. Had it not existed, they would have seized upon some other cleavage at the mass level, or invented one. In fact, to a considerable extent, the modern ethnic identifications that clashed in mortal combat were not primordial, but the constructions of cultural entrepreneurs who sought to ride them to political and class dominance. [p. 298] 222</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ARTICLE In fact, Diamond goes much further along this path, arguing that such ethnic appeals enjoyed only partial success. Like others before him, Di- amond sees in the 1964 general strike the awakening of a working-class consciousness that was beginning to transcend ethnicity. Similarly, in his analysis of the federal election of that year, he stresses the extent to which 'the ethnic current ... was the construction of politicians and not the eruption of popular sentiments' (p. 241). We are left, therefore, with the contention that it was the inability of the politicians themselves to moderate their behaviour that strained the political system to breaking point. This is, in turn, attributed to the peculiarities of Nigerian capitalism. While colonial rule had impeded indigenous capital accumulation, the fetters began to be removed in the 1950s. Because the aspirant bourgeoisie was so weak, the resources at the disposal of the regional governments, especially in the form of Marketing Board reserves, held a powerful attraction. There is a substantial body of literature on the First Republic which details the manner in which an emergent capitalist class in each region was weaned on state patronage. Diamond uses this evidence to suggest that the 'political class' in each region fought so hard to establish a monopoly of political power precisely because exclusion from public office simultaneously implied the loss of a class base: Because state office or patronage was virtually the only means to attain a position in the emergent dominant class, and yet state resources were too limited to satisfy all comers, competition for state control was inevitable-and inevitably tense. No candidate or party could afford to lose an election, for that would mean exclusion from the resources of class formation. Having triumphed initially, none could afford to risk defeat, for that would mean losing the means with which to consolidate the structure of class dominance, and one's own position in it. [p. 283] This line of argument does, however, raise the question of why the parties in control of the regions could not have struck an accord which would have left each in control of its own domain, with a sharing of offices at the federal level. Indeed, such a formula was proposed on a number of occasions and seems to have underpinned the strategy favoured by Akintola. Diamond does not adequately explain why this formula failed to find acceptance. However, it would be consistent with his thesis to suggest both that the federal plum was too much to resist and that the NPC felt no need to bargain when it could dominate the federation through control of the north. However, one might also add to this the psychology of mistrust. That is, no party dare drop its guard for fear that its opponents would strike a telling blow. In place of compromise, future security demanded that each of the actors press for a conclusive victory. This is the political logic which had brought Nigeria to the verge of a Hobbesian state of war by 1966. In support of his view that intra-class rivalry, rather than ethnicity per se, has constituted the fatal flaw in Nigerian politics, Diamond refers to the experience of the Second Republic. He makes the point that ethnicity lost much of its salience, partly because of the increasing significance of class cleavage and partly as a result of changes in the federal system.' Nevertheless, the Second Republic fell prey to the same schisms as its predecessor and for the same reason: namely, the inability of the political class to compromise in 223</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ARTICLE the pursuit of power. One could certainly question the assumption that urbanisation and even glaring inequality need necessarily forge a new class consciousness which would weaken the bonds of ethnicity-an assumption that Diamond does not entirely reject. Again, the formulation of a 'political class', which is borrowed rather than invented by the author, is conceptually untidy. However, it does depict a reality, a symbiosis of political and economic power, which is familiar to most observers of Nigeria. To that extent it makes a meaningful discussion of Nigerian politics possible. By contrast, the book by Ihonvbere and Shaw illustrates the classic error within Marxism of transferring class categories derived from a level of abstraction directly to concrete circumstances. This makes a discussion of political behaviour virtually impossible without resorting to anthropomorphism of classes. The book by Richard Joseph is a more self-consciously theoretical piece of work than that of Diamond. Indeed, the author devotes about a third of the book to the elaboration of a theoretical model of 'prebendal politics'. The relationship between the theoretical and the empirical sections is the source of a certain amount of confusion. Initially it appears as if the empirical chapters are designed primarily to support the theoretical discussion. Thus, despite the subtitle of the book, the author barely discusses the politics of the Second Republic. The reason why the book leaps from a discussion of the 1979 elections to those of 1983 can perhaps be understood if we assume that the author saw in the elections a useful illustration of political behaviour in a prebendal system. Certainly Joseph regards the breakdown of order in 1983 as a consequence of the removal of the military as an impartial referee. Curiously, though, the empirical chapters relate only very broadly to the theoretical discussion and provide little direct support for the propositions advanced. That these empirical sections seem to stand by themselves reflects the fact that the research was conducted some time before the author arrived at the need for a theory. One suspects that the book would have been more coherent if the author had asked new questions of his evidence, derived from his own theoretical advancements. As it is, we are presented with a book consisting of many valuable components, especially those dealing with the transition to civilian rule in 1979, but which is disaggregated as a whole. Joseph seeks to build a model which will capture both the communalistic and the highly materialistic dimensions of Nigerian political life. The two are coupled in his discussion of clientelism. Taking the well-worn dictum that ethnic and class action need not be contradictory, and may well reinforce each other, Joseph argues that patron-client ties often provide the means by which individuals join the ranks of the dominant class, while ethnicity 'comprises sets of easily mobilised identities which can be invoked to add greater strength to patron-client ties and can mask the more materialistic motivation of patrons and clients alike' (p. 55). What is significant about this formulation is that primacy is accorded to a relationship of material exchange, which is the very essence of clientelism, while the emotive link of ethnicity merely adds cement to the relationship. Joseph adds further weight to this when he suggests that clientelism can actually help to shift the focus of group affiliations away from cultural identity (p. 59). This would suggest, in common with the Diamond position, that ethnicity is a dependent variable. 224</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ARTICLE However, when he introduces the concept of prebendalism, which is adapted from the work of Weber, Joseph insists on the communal dimension as an integral part of his definition. ... the mere existence of a patronage system, even one based on clientelistic ties of significant duration, should not warrant the application of the term 'prebendal- ism'. To preserve the analytical sharpness of this formulation, a prebendal system will be seen not only as one in which the offices of state are allocated and then exploited as benefices by the office-holders, but also as one where such a practice is legitimated by a set of political norms according to which the appropriation of such offices is not just an act of individual greed or ambition but concurrently the satisfaction of the short-term objectives of a sub-set of the general population. [p. 67] Clientelism and prebendalism differ, then, in so far as the latter is focused on the offices of the state, but also, seemingly, in that it includes this aspect of communal solidarity. If the second difference does not merely exist in the mind of this reviewer, it is not obvious why it was introduced. It possibly reflects the uneasiness felt by the author about integrating both the commun- al and the materialistic dimensions in a manner which is both theoretically rigorous and faithful enough to Nigerian reality. Thus ethnicity shuttles between being contingent and fundamental to Nigerian politics. On balance Joseph differs from Diamond in the importance he attaches to the ethnic dimensions. Whereas Diamond often treats political cleavage as confined to the political class, Joseph stresses that prebendalism receives its support from below, from communities which expect their local champions to divert public resources for their benefit. This is, of course, consistent with office-holders using their positions for private benefit as well. Joseph, like Ihonvbere and Shaw, stresses the manner in which the oil boom swelled state revenues and thus expanded the opportunities for private accumulation based on political power. The net result is the same as that perceived by Diamond: that is, a zero-sum struggle for mastery of the state. The theoretical model mapped out by Joseph raises some potentially interesting questions about the politics of the Second Republic. Taking the 1979 elections, one would like to know more about the relative significance of communal solidarities and the expectations of material reward in determining the way in which Nigerians voted. In the light of the importance Joseph attaches to clientelism, one would want more information on whether there was already a well-articulated structure of patron-client ties binding national leaders and grassroots supporters. If the links were hastily cobbled together in preparation for the election, as one suspects, then it is important to ask whether clientelistic structures continued to be lubricated after the successful candidates took office. If they were allowed to lapse, it is likely that many incumbents faced difficulties in resuscitating political networks in time for the 1983 elections. One might even hypothesise that the proliferation of electoral malpractices in 1983 reflected not only the absence of a referee, but also the poverty of clientelism as a political resource. However, Joseph provides little evidence of clientelism in his account of either set of elections. In the two most illuminating chapters he does reveal a process of ethnic consolidation amongst the Yoruba and the Ibo which casts doubt on the 225</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ARTICLE Diamond interpretation. But here the explanation for ethnic solidarity is sought in the personal appeal of Azikiwe and Awolowo: When Azikiwe finally made his decision [to join the NPP], the preferences of a community of several million moved with him. Indeed, at that moment, he symbolized the community as an operative unit. [p. 96] Having demonstrated the victory of ethnic unity over sub-ethnic division in 1979, the author does not return to this issue in his treatment of the 1983 elections. However, given the strength of sub-ethnic rivalries in many states, it is surely possible that political realignment had taken place between 1979 and 1983. It is even possible that the NPN would have won Anambra and Oyo states without rigging. Elections have a disturbing tendency to look different depending on whether the point of reference is the national or local level. If one is interested in elections, there is perhaps no substitute for solid local studies to provide the evidence against which we can test our hypoth- eses. Miles prefaces his book with the assertion that anthropology has much to offer political science, that is if the aim is to understand why people behave as they do. The book itself tries to understand the 1983 election through the eyes of a rural community, where the author happened to be engaged in field research at the time. It is unfortunate that the area of study is so excessively local: that is, a single village, Yardaji, which the author himself describes as 'an insignificant Hausa village on the northern outskirts of Kaduna state' (p. 19). Partly for this reason the study yields a very limited picture of the wider politics of one of the more turbulent states in the Second Republic. In fact, the author on occasions seems to imply that Yardaji was experiencing politics for the first time. However, these inadequacies aside, Miles provides us with an account which sheds some light on the processes referred to by Joseph. What is first of all apparent is that the village did not seem to be part of any wider patron-client structure. Such was the cynicism about politi- cians, who promised much and delivered little, that the village youth group put up a poster at the beginning of the campaign warning all political parties to stay clear of Yardaji. However, the author then goes on to show how the village was sucked into the election so that all the major parties were represented there by polling day. Miles makes the point that the election provided some much-needed entertainment. However, one might also observe that if there were any material benefits to be distributed, these were going to change hands during the campaign and not afterwards. The second point is that the 'prebendal' impulse was only loosely apparent. The author was surprised to find that, in such a conservative Hausa community, ethnicity seemed to matter so little. While Shagari was highly unpopular, the NPP was able to garner considerable local support, despite the fact that it was associated with one of the symbols of Ibo identity, namely Azikiwe himself. Thus the NPP polled over 23 per cent of the vote in the presidential election and 62-9 per cent in the election for the House of Representatives (pp. 106-7). However, when it came to the State Assembly election, the prebendal impulse was more obvious. In their concern to ensure that a man from Yardaji was elected, the villagers engaged in electoral malpractice for the first time. These first two points lead to a third, namely that popular interest in 226</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ARTICLE democratic participation was limited. Miles suggests that this was because many of the basic premises of liberal democracy, such as equality, were not shared by the community. Moreover, he argues that the vitriol which the campaign generated, which is nicely captured in the songs which the author has recorded, offended against Hausa cultural values. This perhaps adds further weight to the view that, while democracy is the universal demand of the dominant classes in Nigeria, at the grassroots the desire is above all for a system that delivers the goods. Finally, by way of a conclusion, it remains to consider the implications of the arguments reviewed here for the future of the Third Republic. This might be considered premature, given that even a constitution has yet to be agreed upon. However, there is a prior question of whether constitutional improvements can substantially reshape modes of political behaviour which may be deeply rooted in the structures of Nigerian society. There is some consensus that, in so far as ethnicity is situational, its divisive effects may be mitigated through altering the institutional context. However, Diamond may well be correct in stressing that ethnicity per se has been a less significant source of cleavage than intra-class struggles for control of the state. Even Joseph, who attributes greater significance to the ethnic factor, stops short of advocating a consociational solution to Nigerian politics, because this neglects the fact that the political elite is part of the problem. The implication of each of these analyses is that zero-sum political competition could only be curbed if there was a Leviathan to impose a common set of rules of the game on all the parties. In fact, in a separate article (1984) Diamond puts the case for a military role in government, alongside reforms designed to disengage the state from the economy. All the indications are that Nigerians will enter the Third Republic without such a Leviathan as the military returns to the barracks. That being the case, what is the likelihood that civilian rule will avoid the conflicts of the past? Some of the measures being adopted by the Babangida regime appear hopelessly naive. Thus it must be doubted whether the public education campaigns through MAMSER, and even the ban on old politicians, will have much effect in themselves. However, the fact that the government has addressed the demand for more states and intends to carry out a long-awaited census may well resolve some of the issues which have divided the politicians. Moreover, the lengthy detention of many Second Republic politicians on grounds of corruption could temper the enthusiasm for graft in the next leadership. This would not be the case if anybody seriously believed that the military has finally disengaged from politics. However, it is doubtful that many do. There may also be some truth in the suggestion, which Ihonvbere and Shaw hint at but fail to pursue, that a genuine capitalist class has begun to emerge in Nigeria. Such a 'national bourgeoisie' might be less dependent on primitive accumulation at the expense of the public purse. However, if this class faction does exist, it might prove too weak to hold its own. Indeed, it may come to favour a more permanent role for the military, which is closely associated with policies of economic nationalism. If a working-class consciousness does begin to im- pinge on the political system in a more profound fashion than it has so far, this may also release pressures inimical to democracy. If the Second Republic provided some evidence of electoral support for a more radical programme, 227</page><page sequence="8">228 REVIEW ARTICLE notably that of the PRP, it also revealed the weakness of the left and the willingness of the political establishment to exploit that weakness. However, it may be that the stability of the Third Republic is threatened more by faction fighting within the dominant class than by an onslaught from below. The clashes in the Constituent Assembly over the Sharia issue and the conduct of the local government elections in some areas suggest that there may be some way to go before the new spirit of compromise is arrived at.
