Eine Untersuchung zur Phraseologie der Tempelin- schriften. By EBERHARD OTTO. (Abhandlun- gen der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissen- schaften, Philosophisch-historische Klasse. Jahrgang 1964, I. Abhandlung.) Pp. 196. Heidelberg:CARL WINTER-UNIVERSITXTSVER- LAG 1964. DM 36. Professor E. Otto who is well known as an Egyptologist examines under the general title "Gott und Mensch" the inscriptions of the Tem- ples in their religious aspects, during the Greco- Roman Period. He groups his material under four headings: "Declarations about God" (pp. 11-40) "Man and World before Divinity" (pp. 40-63) "The Role of the King" (pp. 63-83) and "God's Notion and Cult Reality" (pp. 83-91) He takes an interest in the titles and epithets of the gods and king, firstly in the cult and rituals and secondly in their context. Neverthe- less, "nobody may expect to find there-says the author in his Preface-a phraseological lexicon nor a complete catalogue, but he may find a representative choice of all those titles." The au- thor is conscious that this work is only preliminary, if not just an outline of the texts in certain Temples. Philae, Esna and Thebes were not yet entirely published. In all, Otto assembles a goodly number of titles and epithets that, al- together, constitute a well documented work. In the first part, among the divine attributes, the author commences with an examination of the formulae of uniqueness, omnipotence, omni- science and non-perceptibility following with jus- tice and the formulae dealing with the relation of deity to man. The formulae of uniqueness such as "there is no god(goddess) of his kind" should not give the impression that there was a monotheistic tend- ency. On the contrary they apply to many di- vinities indiscriminately and also with a certain variant to the kings and the buildings. The almighty power of the divinity appears especially in the oracles and their certain fullfill- ment, and this power is also expressed through such formulae as "what comes out of his mouth happens right away," or "everything happensac- cording to his order." The attribute of omniscience was in very general use in Egypt under its dual form: that of the magical or oracular type and that of judgement, observation and vision rather than the action or the prediction of facts. Neither was this attribute exclusive to divin- ities, but was found in the divined king. The idea of justice is found in many titles, epithets and formulae but it was applied in a special way to the god(s) in the Temples of Ptolemaic times. The title of vizier (mr nwt, s3b t3jtj) which in the New Kingdom only sporadically belonged to Chnum or Thot, had in this period been given to many divinities, even to Isis and Hathor. "Vizier" was sometimes associated with "maat," also per- sonified in the female divinity of the same name. Maat is not a simple abstract term as is "justice," but it is a divine quality, which as gift to the world and especially to the king, maintains the moral order in the human society. Prof. Otto tells us more about the formulae of "justice" and its synonyms, which are not at all exclusive to the Greco-Roman Period. To show us not only the transcendency of the divinities, but also the other side of the medal, the salutiferous will of the divinities, the author tells us of their desire to "help" and "listen" (pp. 28ff.) to those who invoke them (cs, Apr and njs). Such formulae as Adm sprw, lj n cs n.f, with their variants are not scarce since the New King- dom, where the relation between deity and man was getting more direct and more personnal. We may say that the inscriptions in the Temples of the last epoch have multiplied that effort of the divine condescendence towards man by the anthropomor- phisms which humanize the gods. Numerous are the formulae attached to the heart (ib). They aim at better understanding the divine humanly ex- pressed than to elucidate the nature of the gods (p. 31). Under the heading "God and Man before the Divinity," Otto presents us the human being in his totality before the Deity, even though the in-</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 317 scriptions in the Temples care little about man in particular. Man is never considered as being an associate of the divinity even in this late Period, but he is always represented by his intermediaries: the king and priests. At first the author gives us the terms that design the "collective man": "all faces" (irw nbw), "everybody" (bw nb), "those upon earth" (tpjw.t3), "the totality" (tmw) and "all eye" (lr.t nb.t). The human totality occurs also in the group of opposite terms: "Men and Women", "great and small", "existing and non- existing", "these and those." All these terms cover all humanity without any distinction of race and social condition. Fidelity and submission of man towards the gods take place under the image of "water" or of the "route" (for example "to lie," "to walk" on the water of someone (god or goddess). The locu- tions that manifest the relations between the di- vinity and man all have an anthropomorphic basis: love, hate, the eye, the ear. The fidelity of man towards his moral engagements creates love of the god who gives the capacity to see and to hear. Among the gifts of the divinity are the air that man breathes and the breath of life (t3w n cnh). The author also looks at the question about the creation, paradise and the posthumous life. As to paradise, he points out that such an idea was strange to Egyptians (pp. 62-63) and that the few texts on this matter are due to Gnostic or foreign (Greek) influence. The king's role at the Temple was multiple, as witness the inscriptions in the Temples. These inscriptions, in an eulogical tone, extol the king as a son of the gods, protector and conservator of nature (p. 64), "the vital breath for men," "the father of pct, the mother of the rhywt, the nurse of the hnm.t, defender of the great, leader of the little, conductor ... the perfect god that has no equal" (p. 64). Despite the divine epithets, the king is not assimilated with the divinities except in the limited sense (p. 66). He is called "son," "living image" (ssp cnh), the "sec- ond" or "the image" of a particular god. By preference he is placed in relationship with Thot. To make us delve more deeply into the royal portrait, Otto studies the three longest inscriptions at Edfu. In these appear the priestly titles of the King used in the proclamations made during the exercise of the daily ritual, similar to that of the New Kingdom. Those titles gave to the "secu- larized" kingship more prestige before the gods, than the title monarch. The most important role of the king was to exercise justice that honored the gods, especially in promoting the "maat." In the last part of the book, Otto advances the question: What meaning had the rites accom- plished in the Temple and what do they procure for a better knowledge of the gods nature during the Ptolemaic Period? Even though the inscrip- tions in the Temples of this epoch are neither ex- clusive nor new, the author accentuates the in- terest of the gods over the world's government and the mutual relations between the gods and men in the more general and non-dogmatic religious sense. The offerings to the divinity were closely related to the counter-gift, solicited on the prin- ciple: Do-ut-des. Former rites that celebrated a mythical event were performed in the Temple to preserve the universal order against the forces of the world. What is specific to those rituals of the Ptolemaic Temples is their immediacy, the direct- ness of the relation between the gift and the counter-gift, making an abstraction of the mythical element, that is nevertheless subjacent. Thus the object of the rites or of the offerings is actualized in a new way. Otto proceeds with reserve as to that statement and he says that this novelty does not change anything in the context of the daily ritual nor in the mythological background of the festival ritual. To the question about the relations of the gods to the world and the relations between the gods themselves, Otto answers that the divine ac- tion to the world is immediate and perpetual, for example the action of Maat. The disposition of time, of day and night, is not finished by an act, but it is a repetition without end. The sun, the personification of the divine, is durable and the fact of seeing is always desired. The gods function and their epithets in these inscriptions are fluid and interchangeable.

In a long alphabetical Index, very well docu- mented, Otto groups together the terms and locu- tions mostly used in the book. The book is com- pleted by a very useful Egyptological Register and by a Hieroglyphic autographed Appendix, con- taining 417 lines. This conscientious and well co- ordinated work is an invitation to further research in the very intricate field of Egyptian religion.
