Has the reception of Elias Canetti entered a new phase? Predictably, Hanser, his publisher of many decades, has responded to the centenary of his birth with an onslaught of new titles. But other houses have also published new scholarship on Canetti's work. Most notably, Camden House is trying to secure the author a more central place in the English-speaking world with a new study on Canetti's magnum opus, Masse und Macht [ Crowds and Power, 1960], and with an excellent and wide-ranging collection of articles in its prestigious Companion series. In his contribution to the latter volume, William Donahue proposes</page><page sequence="2">ULRICH PLASS 235 that 'Canetti's death [in 1994] inaugurates a more independent and, I believe, a more fruitful phase of criticism' (p. 26). I would like to emphasize the word independent, since much of Canetti scholarship tends to be heavily influenced by the author's own interpretations. Donahue, then a graduate student, had been on his way to visit the author to talk about his dissertation on Canetti's seminal novel Die Blendung [Auto-da F?, 1935], when the writer's death was first reported in the news, shortly after his clandestine funeral. This anecdote is typical not only for the extent to which Canetti scholars engaged in the practice of seeking the master's approval of their research; it also reiterates another habit of Canetti scholarship: to include biographical reference. Even authors with no anecdotes of their own like to dwell on the fascinating complexity of Canetti's multicultural, multilingual and truly European life. One of the measures of a more independent investigation of Canetti's work will be the degree to which scholars are able to question the biographical model and to develop categories that are adequate both to the works themselves and to their intellectual and historical context. Since Canetti's global fame was and still is mostly due to his best-selling memoirs, the popular reception of his work has been inseparable from his life. The challenge in writing the first biography of Canetti lies in reading his autobiographies against the grain, trying to disentangle fiction and fact, Dichtung and Wahrheit. Sven Hanuschek masters this daunting challenge with mixed results. At the Zentralbibliothek in Zurich, he diligently went through some 130 boxes of unpublished papers, including a large number of notes from Canetti's decades of research for Masse und Macht (the more personal documents, diaries and cor respondence, have been sealed off until 2024). However, anyone expecting to find the 'true' Canetti revealed will be disappointed. In his methodological reflections at the beginning of the book, Hanuschek concedes the enormous difficulties of narrating the life and uvre of a mythomaniac and protean poet obsessed with the phenomenon of metamorphosis. Hanuschek embraces Canetti's obsession by declaring the author's innumerable notes to be the hermeneutic key. This is a daring but necessary step: precisely because the notes (Aufzeichnungen ? the term encompasses the published as well as the unpublished notes) contain all the different and contradictory faces of the author, Hanuschek argues that the only work that truly contains the author in all his facets and the one that must therefore be regarded as his main work is neither Die Blendung nor Masse und Macht but his notes (cf. p. 172). This claim implies a methodological difficulty for the biographer: if the highly elusive and, by definition, always incomplete notes contain the author 'completely', as Hanuschek puts it, then this author-subject resists</page><page sequence="3">236 New Books by and about Canetti straightforward narrative biographical representation. Hanuschek's initial emphasis on Canetti as an author-actor who effortlessly puts on a variety of author-masks (such as the mask of the failed poet, who strives but never succeeds in completing his life's work) is essential: since Canetti 's life is often defined through his quixotic struggle for absolutely sovereign authorship, the life cannot be extricated from the work, and the biographer has no choice but to follow the irresolvable contradictions of the work. The success of this biography must be judged by how productively and insightfully it interprets Canetti's work in all its astonishing and exhilarating but also highly disturbing and questionable aspects. While he presents immensely informative new archival findings, Hanuschek also spends much time rehearsing biographical events already known; admittedly, in narrating Canetti's childhood, he has no materials available other than Die gerettete Zunge [ The Tongue Set Free, 1977] and his own imagination, which results in frequent speculative formulations. Throughout the book, Hanuschek invokes the intriguing vastness of Canetti's social networks by guiding the reader through a seemingly endless list of relatives, friends, foes and acquaintances, some times without providing a clear enough sense of the intellectual and literary significance of these social relations. At times, the narrative veers toward the merely anecdotal. To be sure, Hanuschek's more detailed attention to Canetti's first wife, Veza, has been long overdue, but the biographer does not enlighten his readers about the exact qualities of Veza as a writer. Without a doubt, she deserves her own biography. The few chapters explicitly dedicated to Canetti's works do little to advance existing scholarship; it is in those chapters that one notices most strongly that this first monumental account of Canetti's life does not easily open up a new perspective on his literary and essayistic production. Even the core of Hanuschek's argument, his discussion of the notes, remains limited to descriptions of the material and correct but familiar references to literary history and secondary literature. While the notes are, for Hanuschek, Canetti's major work, they are of limited use in structuring a biographical narrative, since they represent a life-long daily writing routine, often rehearsing similar ideas and images over the course of several decades, without a firm sense of development and progression. The difficulty in evaluating the notes is due not only to their fragmentary form, but also to their uneven literary and philosophical quality: they never cohere to form a completed work; to the end, they remain a work in progress that represents Canetti's constant struggle to assert his identity and productivity as one of the dominant writers of the twentieth century.</page><page sequence="4">ULRICH PLASS 237 The publication of the brief volume Aufzeichnungen f?r Marie-Louise is remarkable because it contains only hitherto unpublished notes. Given how highly they are praised by their editor, Jeremy Adler, in his afterword, they are bound to disappoint some expectations. Adler writes as an ardent admirer and one of the authoritative experts on Canetti: his father, the writer H. G. Adler, was a close friend of Canetti's, and his own expertise in editing and introducing Canetti's unpublished works has been invaluable. Unlike the works authorized by Canetti himself, the publications from his Nachlass are distinguished by a very helpful editorial apparatus including biographical commentaries and textual interpretations. Occasionally, Adler's philological expertise is overshadowed by too much personal proximity to his subject, resulting in unnecessarily exaggerated praise. Adler views the notes as the successful attempt to fuse philosophy and literature, reflection and imagery into a new type of quasi-mythical text (cf. p. 69). Adler is not alone in his admiration: the essays by Sigurd Paul Scheichl on 'Canetti's Aufzeichnungen' and by Wolfgang Mieder on 'Elias Canetti's Proverbial Aphorisms' (both contained in the Camden House Companion) celebrate the notes as works of art and intellectual achievements of the highest order, comparing them to predecessors such as Lichtenberg or Kraus. However, now that the notes have been claimed as one of the most significant parts, if not the centre of Canetti's uvre, it is perhaps time for a more distanced and critical approach. Canetti's notes dedicated to his friend, lover and patron, the Viennese ?migr?e and painter Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, date from 1942, when Canetti had just begun his daily routine of note-writing. While some of the notes seem rather irrelevant ('Die Kr?hen ?ber dem gelben Korn geben mir das heftigste Gef?hl des Lebens' [The crows above the yellow cornfield give me the most intense feeling of life, p. 13]), others seem to contain a witty thought: 'Der Mensch ist das Ma? aller Tiere' [Man is the measure of all animals] (p. 47), or 'Man hat die Hunde zu wenig studiert: sie sind das "Menschliche" in Quintessenz, und wie unmenschlich ist es!' [Dogs have been too little studied: they are quintessentially 'human', and how inhuman that is!] (p. 39). Do these aphorisms open up a new path towards understanding the relationship between humanity and animality? It seems to me that animal here is nothing but the negative of the human, the inhuman, and thus precisely not radically 'other' to the human. In other words, the philosophical perspective of these aphorisms is still fundamentally anthropomorphic and anthropocentric. If one considers the aphorisms on animals collected in the recent ?ber Tiere,1 one is tempted to conclude that Canetti's thought on this subject 1 Elias Canetti, ?ber Tiere (Munich, 2002).</page><page sequence="5">238 New Books by and about Canetti perhaps never progressed significantly. However, Dagmar Lorenz, in her carefully crafted essay 'Canetti's Final Frontier: The Animal' (also in the Camden House Companion), argues that Canetti's thoughts on animals did develop from 'his earlier, mostly abstract configuration of the concepts of "man and animal" as myth and metaphor to a more literal understanding and to a real concern for their well-being in a world increasingly dominated and devastated by humans' (p. 239). Lorenz points out that Canetti's views are close to Adorno's and Horkheimer's critique of Western humanism that 'depended on the exclusion of animals and a historical progression that culminated in the justification of mass murder' (p. 250). However, since Canetti refuses to participate in traditional philosophical discourse, it becomes rather vexing to situate his thoughts reliably in intellectual and historical terms. 'None of the categories on which Western philosophers, theologians, psychologists, and scientists base their hierarchies of species matter to him, most likely because he considers these very hierarchies a rationalization of indefensible acts: war, the death penalty, and euthanasia' (p. 251). Yet this refusal to employ conventional categories also implies a peril not easily dismissed. By obstinately claiming a position outside of the main stream of Western thought, Canetti risks falling into the trap of the self styled renegade, thus effectively sealing off his thought from potentially fruitful exchange with different and challenging ideas. Hence, one can view Canetti's almost calculated untimeliness (in her introduction to the Camden House Companion, Lorenz refers to his works as being 'unzeitgem??' [p. 14]) not only as his peculiar kind of postmodernism (as Lorenz suggests), but, more critically, as a refusal to engage directly with others. One example of an unsuccessful communication is contained in the tenth and final volume of the Hanser edition of Canetti's collected works (this Werkausgabe does not include the separately published volumes from the Nachlass), titled Aufs?tze, Reden, Gespr?che. In a 1962 discussion with Theodor Adorno, Canetti responds coolly to the philosopher's attempts to underscore similarities between the idea of survival as power first articulated in Masse und Macht and the idea of a self-destructive dynamic of self-preservation first articulated by Adorno and Horkheimer in Dialektik der Aufkl?rung [Dialectic of Enlightenment, 1947]. Nonetheless, Canetti does come across as an erudite storyteller, and the conversation is ? for all its miscommunication ? certainly one of the most intellectually serious in the book. Despite the great interest that Adorno took in Masse und Macht, Canetti did not have much good to say about him privately, calling him, as Hanuschek reports in his biography, 'das "ekelhafteste Beispiel eines Philosophen'" [the most repulsive example</page><page sequence="6">ULRICH PLASS 239 of a philosopher] (p. 495). Perhaps Canetti preferred tamer, more adoring interlocutors. The volume contains a transcript of Canetti's 1968 radio interview with his former Zurich high-school teacher Friedrich Witz, whom, in Die gerettete Zunge, Canetti had lovingly portrayed as 'the enthusiast'. It was during Witz's lessons that Canetti became familiar with a model of knowledge that does not proceed ideologically: 'Man schritt nicht voran, man war bald da, bald dort, man hatte kein Ziel' [One did not progress, one was first here, then there, one did not have a goal]. From Witz he learned, for the first time, 'die Lust an der Verwandlung' [the pleasure of metamorphosis].2 Conversations such as these are thus crucial for a better understanding of how Canetti tried to integrate every aspect of his life into his work, of how he countered his declared enemy, death, by submitting everything to his will to immortality ? with the result of turning all life into work, essentially mortifying it.3 Canetti's authorship included his virtuoso mastery of the roles of student and teacher. In his dissertation, In der Provinz des Lehrers. Rollenbilder und Selbstentw?rfe in Leben und Werk von Elias Canetti, Bertram Kazmirowski shows how the construction of Canetti's work is based on the performance of these roles. Kazmirowski is especially fond of Canetti's later friendship with Witz, reprinting the radio interview and their correspondence. However, this relationship is less instructive for an understanding of pedagogical power than, for instance, the relations in which Canetti takes on the role of authoritative teacher. Kazmi rowski correctly observes that Canetti's authorial empowerment comes fully into its own when he acts as teacher. Although he tends to dwell on episodes reported in Canetti's autobiographies, Kazmirowski con vincingly portrays the author-teacher as a ruthless power-wielder ('Macht haber') who demands complete submission of his female students such as Friedl Benedikt and Iris Murdoch. In his role as teacher, Canetti is not the 'earwitness' that we encounter in his eponymous work,4 but the absolute authority that wishes to be heard. In Party im Blitz [Party in the Blitz] (from which Kazmirowski quotes frequently), Canetti notes: 'Es gibt nichts, das mich so stark zum Umgang mit bestimmten Menschen zwang als ihr Wunsch, mir zuzuh?ren' [Nothing compelled me more to socialize with certain people than their wish to listen to me] (Party im Blitz, p. 183). Kazmirowski describes the submission of Canetti's female students as 'H?rigkeit', a form of dependency that, while etymologically 2 Elias Canetti, Die gerettete Zunge. Geschichte einer Jugend (Frankfurt a. M., 1979), p. 292. 3 For a brilliant presentation of this argument, see Ursula Ruppel, Der Tod und Canetti (Hamburg, 1995). 4 Elias Canetti, Der Ohrenzeuge. F?nfzig Charaktere (Frankfurt a. M., 1983).</page><page sequence="7">240 New Booh by and about Canetti derived from 'h?ren' [to hear], primarily signifies sexual submission. Canetti thus ruled over text and body of the female writers he mentored (cf. In der Provinz des Lehrers, p. 300). Moreover, his pedagogy aimed at the sustained dependency of his students: Friedl Benedikt dedicated all of her novels, published under the pseudonym 'Anna Sebastian', to her 'great master'. When Party im Blitz was published in 2003, reviewers were unanimously appalled by Canetti 's hateful tirades about Iris Murdoch, whom he disqualifies to equal degrees as writer and as lover. In Kazmirowski's interpretation, these bitter attacks (so incomparable with the clich? of the milder old Canetti) must be understood as a manifestation of Canetti 's powerlessness over his enormously prolific and successful student (Murdoch published twenty-six novels, Canetti one). Canetti, who liked to see himself as the most severe critic of all power, was not able to let go of the power he had experienced as teacher: 'Die Situation des Uberlebens ist die zentrale Situation der Macht' [The situation of survival is the central situation of power] Working on Party im Blitz towards the end of his life meant acknowledging the possibility that his former student Murdoch, unlike Friedl Benedikt or Veza Canetti, was to survive him ? the ultimate instance of power. For Kazmirowski, Canetti the teacher embodies par excellence the 'two-sided face of power' described in Masse und Macht as 'das spendende wie das mordende' [the giving and the murdering one].6 While Party im Blitz is an unfinished fragment, often aggressive in tone and occasionally surprisingly myopic, it does contain some incisive portraits and some hilarious descriptions of life in England during the Blitz, exhibiting Canetti's knack for viciously comical depictions of people and situations. During the time of frequent German air-raids, the Canettis were renting rooms in a house in Chesham Bois. Their landlords, Gordon and Agnes Milburn, are described as spindly, pious and fearful. When the sirens sound, the Milburns seek cover under their kitchen table, praying silently, while Veza Canetti fearlessly exploits her unaccustomed freedom in the kitchen. When the air-raid alarm continues for a long time, the cowering couple starts to feel hungry: Wenn es lange dauerte, wurden die Milburns hungrig. Sie sagten es nie, ihre Bef?rchtung, da? ein Pilot oben durch ihre Stimmen auf sie aufmerksam werden k?nnte, setzte nie aus, aber wenn Veza ihnen das Essen unterm Tische zuschob, l?ppten sie es gierig auf wie Hunde. Die Laute ihres Schl?rfens waren bis zu uns hinauf zu vernehmen. Als Hunde f?rchteten sie die Aufmerksamkeit der Flieger oben nicht, (p. 59) 5 Elias Canetti, 'Macht und ?berleben', in Das Gewissen der Worte. Essays (Frankfurt a.M., 1981), pp. 25-44 ( ? 27)? Elias Canetti, Masse und Macht (Frankfurt a. M, 1980), p. 503.</page><page sequence="8">ULRICH PLASS 241 [If it went on for a long time, the Milburns became hungry. They never said it, because their fear that a pilot above could notice their voices never abated, but if Veza shoved their food under the table to them, they lapped it up greedily, like dogs. The noise of their slurping was audible up to where we were sitting. As dogs they did not fear the attention of the pilots.] Canetti contrasts this scene with the unfathomable serenity of most people he meets, who, he reports, remained 'so ruhig, da? ich manch mal fassungslos staunte' [so calm that it sometimes stunned me] (p. 161). The best passages in the book are those in which he refrains from ethnographical indignation and restricts himself to eloquent bewilderment. Thus, the very first sentence of this memoir is prog rammatic: Tch bin in Verwirrung ?ber England' [I am confused about England] (p. 7). This state of confusion can also be discerned in many of Canetti's judgments about his old friends and acquaintances. They often seem surprisingly unfair and rash, zooming in on random details. In his afterword, Jeremy Adler compares Canetti's poetic technique in Party im Blitz to the writing of a diary (it should be pointed out that Canetti explicitly designated parts of his English memoirs as 'diary'; they will not be available to the public for another twenty years) . Citing Canetti's self description as someone 'der recht eigentlich aus ?bertreibung besteht' [who consists essentially in exaggeration] (p. 218), Adler interprets the crude nature of some character portraits in Party im Blitz as uncensored exaggerations. Because of their proximity to spontaneous, personal diary entries, Canetti's late memoirs have not been purged of the inevitable errors and distortions of unreflected experience. Canetti's poetics of the diary seek to conserve his mistakes unapologetically. One of the most impressive characterizations is Canetti's short but reverential description ? previously published in his short volume of notes from 1992-19937 ? of the poet and anthropologist Franz Baermann Steiner. One gets a sense that this was a very close, productive and trusting intellectual friendship: 'Er war der einzige Mensch, den ich gekannt habe, mit dem ich ?ber Mythen sprechen konnte' [He was the only person I knew with whom I could speak about myths] (p. 128). How can one discern the traces left by this friendship in Canetti's work? His emphasis on myth as one of their central discussion topics suggests that Steiner played a pivotal role in Canetti's research on crowds and power. The most voluminous new contribution to Masse und Macht is the study by Johann P. Arnason and David Roberts. Of all the books reviewed here, this is the most frustrating one, especially since the authors' project itself is promising and praiseworthy: they set out to situate Masse und Macht within the 'broader contexts and currents of social theory' (p. 3), thereby 7 Elias Canetti, Aufaeichnungen 1992-1993 (Munich, 1996), pp. 17-24.</page><page sequence="9">242 New Booh by and about Canetti seeking to move away from the more immanent focus of literary studies, which they view as severely limited. While Canetti notoriously refuses a systematic engagement with theoretical concepts, Arnason and Roberts want to articulate Canetti's project conceptually, thus making it possible to discuss the work more seriously within the social sciences. Given the tendency to interpret Canetti's work through the lens of the author's stated intentions, such an approach is necessary and overdue. It is evident that Arnason and Roberts know their subject-matter thoroughly; David Roberts was one of the first scholars to publish a monograph on Die Blendung, in 1975, which Canetti read and discussed with him.8 Thirty years later, he is on familiar ground. In the first chapter, he deftly links Canetti 's novel to Norbert Elias's ?ber den Proze? der Zivilisation [The Civilizing Process, 1939] and Ernst Cassirer's Die Philosophie der symbolischen Formen [The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, 1923-29]. Unfortunately, this contextualization remains oddly perfunctory and does not reach the analytic acumen of some recent work on Die Blendung? The same is true for the last four chapters of the study dedicated primarily to Masse und Macht (the two last ones are by Arnason). Able discussions of canonical and contemporary works such as Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Freud's Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse [Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, 1921 ], or Moscovici's L'Age des Foules [ The Age of the Crowd, 1981 ] are simply not quite enough to shed a new conceptual light on Masse und Macht, primarily because the authors do not successfully mediate between the concepts they introduce and Canetti's often very peculiar non-conceptual mode of thought. The concluding sentence is characteristic of the entire book, which is full of useful thoughts but short on satisfactory transitions and conclusions. Formulating the noteworthy hypothesis that 'the anthropological infrastructure of liberalism [...] might be inherently and permanently vulnerable to totalitarian twists', Arnason concludes with the following sentence: 'Canetti's general view of the modern world was clearly compatible with that line of thought; but his anthropological reflections were too focused on remote origins and too resistant to conceptual elaborations for the agreement to become more explicit' (p. 137). The final claim, then, is that Canetti's thought is 'clearly compatible' with the critical reading of Hobbes's The Leviathan (1651) suggested by the authors, while Canetti's focus, as Arnason laments, is elsewhere, lost in anthropological reflection. The crucial formulations here are 'compatible' and 'agreement': by translating Masse und Macht, a work that is primarily structured by images and stories, 8 David Roberts, Kopf und Welt. Elias Canettis Roman Vie Blendung' (Munich, 1975). 9 See, for example, William Collins Donahue, The End of Modernism. Elias Canettis Auto-da-F?' (Chapel Hill, NC and London, 2001).</page><page sequence="10">ULRICH PLASS 243 into concepts, one makes it, perhaps, 'compatible', or, at least, more 'agreeable' to the social scientist. However, this newly explored context does not make the text more accessible. In their eagerness to transcend the limited perspective of literary studies, the authors lose sight of the text itself. While the notion of image is included in the title of their study, they do not reflect on the distinction between image and concept and its consequences for Canetti 's thought. They would have done well not to brush aside important contributions such as the 1995 volume Einladung zur Verwandlung as 'primarily of interest as a document of the reception of Crowds and Power9 (p. 139).10 Considering the continued need to come to terms with Masse und Macht, it is fortunate that the Camden House Companion contains two very useful essays on the subject. In his contribution on 'Canetti and Nietzsche', Ritchie Robertson illuminates Canetti's affinity with the 'tradition of Darwinian naturalism', i.e. with the 'study of human life as a part of nature' (p. 201) independent of metaphysical concepts. Specifically, Robertson wants to show Canetti's intellectual proximity to his adversary Nietzsche. He finds a direct link between the two in Canetti's understanding of the lingering force of commands: the resentment felt by the one being commanded can only be discharged if the subordinate himself creates a power relation in which he can now issue 'the same command to someone else' (p. 206). For Robertson, the same power structure can be found in Nietzsche's depiction of the ancient creditor-debtor relation in Zur Genealogie der Moral [On the Genealogy of Morals, 1887]. 'Both are antagonistic and unequal relationships. Here as elsewhere, Canetti depicts power as a zero-sum game: my gain is your loss. These unequal pairs form the cells of which society is composed' (pp. 207-08). The only escape from the relentless rule and reproduction of power is provided by the crowd, because within the crowd, everyone is equal. It is this equality within the crowd that, for Canetti, offers a 'constant potential of renewal' (p. 212). Although Robertson ends up giving Canetti's connection to Nietzsche short shrift, his essay exemplifies precisely the relevance and clarity one expects from a volume intended for readers with only limited prior knowledge of Canetti's work. Essays such as this ensure that the Companion is now the best and most comprehensive introduction to Canetti's writings available in the English language. The second essay on Masse und Macht is by Michael Mack, who ? following his University of Cambridge dissertation11 ? reads the work 10 Einladung zur Verwandlung. Essays zu Elias Canettis 'Masse und Macht', ed. by Michael Kr?ger (Munich, 1995). 11 Michael Mack, Anthropology as Memory. Elias Canettis and Franz Baermann Steiners Responses to the Shoah (T?bingen, 2001).</page><page sequence="11">244 New Booh by and about Canetti as a response to the Shoah. That this obvious historical context has not been thematized before is probably due to the absence of an explicit reference to it in Canetti's writings. However, this conspicuous absence of the words 'Shoah' or 'Holocaust' in Canetti ought not to distract from the historical experience of the rise of Nazism in Germany and Austria, which undoubtedly had a profound impact on Canetti's thought on crowds and power. Mack's argument is that 'Canetti depicts humanity's constitution and history in terms of genocide'. With 'constitution', Mack has in mind '[o]ur bodies, our food habits, our everyday behavior', so that 'everything that has to do with us emerges as an integral part of a huge, all-encompassing killing machine, called "society" or "civilization"' (p. 290). However, Canetti's response to the Shoah is not to be taken simply as a particularly pessimistic or 'bleak worldview'. Rather, Mack suggests, Canetti's depiction of humanity follows a literary strategy aiming to shock his readers. It is thus impossible to account for how his work responds to the Holocaust without analysing the peculiar hybrid genre of Masse und Macht. Mack's attention to literary style is important; worthy of further elaboration is his suggestion that the book is 'a piece of satirical writing' (p. 292). Mack argues that Canetti's satirical approach must be seen in tandem with his attempt to create 'a new type of scholarship' (p. 292) that transcends the allegedly value-free methods of science in such a way that it promotes an ethical impulse. Ethics must trump science and scholarship, without replacing science simply by literature. The ethical impulse in Masse und Macht can best be understood as the refusal to reduce the Shoah to a mere historical phenomenon that can be analysed scientifically and objectively from a safe temporal distance. Like Claude Lanzmann in his film documentary Shoah (1985), Canetti favours an ahistorical approach that inscribes the ever-present trauma of total destruction into the text: 'By presenting fascist behavior as something that is still with us, Canetti wants to shock the reader, and to shock the reader he needs to present a world that is factual; he achieves this by appeal to empirical scientific research' (p. 293). Scientific research is not used as an end in itself, but as a literary means. Masse und Macht is literary in the sense that it seeks to reinvoke in the reader a traumatic experience that resists representation; because of this, it cannot be transformed into fiction. Thus, Masse und Macht is a book that defines its own genre between literature and science, it is a satirical exaggeration of scientific facts that can be fully understood and explained only as a response to the Holocaust. Mack's essay is notable not only for historically and intellectually contextualizing Masse und Macht in a very persuasive manner; it also sheds light on the intellectual debt Canetti owes to Franz Baermann</page><page sequence="12">ULRICH PLASS 245 Steiner's epistemological approach to the Shoah. While Steiner's mode of thought and style of writing are quite different from Canetti's satirical form, both thinkers seek to conceive of the Holocaust as an integral part of civilization that must be comprehended in order to be able to envision 'a better post-Holocaust future' (p. 300). Mack then goes on to demonstrate that despite their fundamental stylistic and methodological differences, Steiner and Canetti share not only an epistemological but also an ethical agenda. The comparison of the two opens up a new and better perspective on Canetti the moralist. Mack's essay certainly fulfils Donahue's hopes for a more independent and fruitful type of Canetti criticism. It is also a significant addition to the depiction of Steiner in Hanuschek's biography. Steiner is, of course, also included in Kristian Wachinger's volume of photographs of Canetti, his family and his social circle. The book is best used as a supplement to the biography. It illustrates Canetti's life not only through pictures, but also through short excerpts from his writings. Regrettably, the book, like the biography, focuses mostly on the immediate biographical environment, but contains only few relevant historical documents such as the picture of the burning Palace of Justice in Vienna in 1927. More such documents in larger reproductions would have been a welcome addition to this volume. Nonetheless, this will remain the most comprehensive collection of Canetti photographs. Any more Canetti would lead to overexposure. Now that we have the first biography, more memoirs and notes, and a large number of new essays, has the image of Canetti changed? I don't think so. Hanuschek's biography is informative but inconclusive; it will not remain the only biography. Much of the scholarship on Canetti is still too much in awe of its subject and too much beholden to the overt themes rather than the uncomfortable exaggerations and conspicuous lacunae in Canetti's work. More transdisciplinary and contextual interpretation is needed. Despite the commercial success of his autobiographical works, Canetti is not an easy author, and, apparently, an overdose of his writings is not healthful, as the occasional exasperated sigh voiced by his mostly extraordinarily patient biographer suggests. Addressing the main theme of Canetti's intellectual and emotional life, Hanuschek complains that the author's statements 'against death', obsessively formulated and reformulated over the span of many decades, are getting on his nerves. In a chapter titled 'Der Tod-Feind' [The Mortal Enemy / The Enemy of Death], the biographer finds these statements unclear, incoherent, inconclusive, repetitive and even nonsensical. After all, most people are somehow against death: 'Wer ist nicht "gegen" den Tod?' [Who is not 'against' death?] (p. 644).
