I8, pp. 473-488 WILLIAM HASKER Professor of Philosophy, Huntington College, Indiana EMERGENTISM I Great philosophical problems are known by their power to rise, phoenix-like, from the ashes of their own dissolution. Indeed, it may be only thus that we are finally convinced of the enduring significance of a problem. The mind-body problem has been dissolved at least twice in the last fifty years: once by the positivists, and again by the therapeutic analysts. Yet it strongly re-asserts itself, so that it is barely a hyperbole when Wilfrid Sellars says that this problem 'soon turns out, as one picks at it, to be nothing more nor less than the philosophical enterprise as a whole'.' Christian theology has not, on the whole, achieved a very happy articulation with the renewed philosophical interest in the mind-body problem. The more orthodox theologies, in so far as they reflect on this problem at all, seem to presuppose some sort of traditional - Cartesian or Thomistic - dualism. But dualism has rather few supporters in contemporary philosophy; the appeal to it needs to be supported by rigorous analysis and argument if it is to be more than special pleading.2 Those theologians who have abandoned dualism have generally done so in the name of some form of existentialism which leaves the metaphysical issues of the mind-body problem untouched; indeed, raising those issues is likely to be regarded as counter-existential. There are at least two theological movements which stand in contrast to these observations. Process theology on the one hand, and the re-creationist doctrines pioneered by John Hick on the other, both represent attempts to reflect freshly on the metaphysical issues of minds and bodies and to present solutions which can be of service to a Christian doctrine of man. I will comment briefly on each of these in order to provide a backdrop for the view to be presented in this paper. While some of my remarks will be argumentative, their purpose is merely to clarify the attitude taken here towards these views. To the account of the self given in process theology I offer two reservations, one metaphysical and one theological. The metaphysical one is this: the account requires us to reconstruct the objects and persons of ordinary 1 ' Intentionality and the Mental', in Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. iI, ed. H. Feigl et al. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, I958), p. 507. 2 For the contemporary defence of dualism see H. D. Lewis, The Self and Immortality (New York: Seabury, 1973) and Persons and Life After Death (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1978), as well as Karl Popper and John Eccles, The Self and Its Brain (New York: Springer International, I 977). My point is not that dualism is necessarily untenable, but that its tenability cannot be taken for granted.</page><page sequence="2">474 WILLIAM HASKER experience, and indeed the whole furniture of earth and heaven, in terms of postulated entities which have simply to be taken on trust as part of a metaphysical system. I have been present on many occasions, but I have never, so far as I can tell, observed or been made aware of a Whiteheadian 'actual occasion'. The temporal processes of which I am aware seem to involve persisting individual entities undergoing continuous change; it is primafacie implausible to insist that these must all be reconstructed in terms of momentary 'occasions' which occur and pass away but which do not change. I am not objecting to metaphysical postulation in general, nor am I claiming that the Whiteheadian scheme is inconsistent or incoherent. But these particular postulations seem both arbitrary and exorbitant, far in excess of any gain in explanatory power that comes from accepting the system. More urgent, in the present context, is the theological difficulty with process theology's account of the person. This account does not lend itself very readily to an affirmation of personal survival, and in its standard forms does not even try to do so. So this theology is able to give only a Pickwickian account of' the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting'. Those who feel that the Creed should be changed to fit the philosophy will not, of course, find this to be a telling objection. Re-creationism, on the other hand, speaks directly to the issue of a future life. But it seems that this view is able to provide for such a life only at the cost of either a contradiction or a category mistake. What I mean is this: on the re-creationist view it would seem that a person simply is a certain (living) body - after all, the wish to dispense with any entity distinct from the body is one of the main motivations of the view. But then to say that it is possible for the body to be lying dead before our eyes, and yet for the person to survive as a 're-created' body, is contradictory and absurd.1 Perhaps, then, the person is not simply identical with his body? The apparent alternative is to take the name of a person - say, 'John Smith' - not as the name of an individual entity but rather as a kind of sortal noun, something like 'copy of today's New rork Times'. But this seems clearly wrong - surely I am an individual entity, and when the question of survival is raised my interest in it is not at all like my interest in having a copy (any copy) of today's paper to read. To be sure, re-creationist theories come in many varieties, and far more discussion than this would be needed to settle accounts with them. But I do not see that any of them is able to overcome this fundamental difficulty. The view I wish to propose shares certain assumptions with each of these two. Like process theology, re-creationism, and standard mind-body identity theories, it rejects the notion of an immaterial part of man whose origin is distinct from that of the human biological organism. Rather, it views mental processes and activities as the natural result of certain complex patterns of functioning of human and animal nervous systems. It agrees with re I See John Hick, Philosophy of Religion, 2nd ed. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1973), p. IOI.</page><page sequence="3">EMERGENTISM 475 creationism and identity theory in holding that those nervous systems are made up just of the molecules, atoms, particles, quarks, gluons, etc., postulated by physical science; it refrains from reconstructing these scientific objects in terms of metaphysically inferred entities such as 'actual occasions'. It agrees with process thought and disagrees with identity theory (and some versions of re-creationism) in accepting as genuine the contra-casual freedom of common sense and free-will philosophy.1 Or to state it more briefly: the view is nondualistic, scientific realist, and liberatarian. From the present perspective the central problem for a mind-body theory is that such a theory, to be satisfactory, must meet two apparently conflicting demands. It must recognize the intimate connection between thought processes and brain processes, yet it must allow those thought processes to be separable from the brain in some way that makes personal survival intelligible. In the view I am proposing, the answer to these two requirements is found in an analogy between the mind (or soul) and the 'fields' (electrical, magnetic, gravitational, etc.) of physical science. If we take the magnetic field as our analogue, we may say that 'as the magnet generates its magnetic field, so the organism generates its conscious field '. The magnetic field is conceived, in keeping with the scientific realist assumptions of the proposed view, as a concrete physical entity, generated by the magnet but distinct from it. Certain states and/or processes in the magnet cause there to be a magnetic field; similarly certain states and/or processes in a living organism cause there to be another kind of field - call it the 'conscious field', or the 'psychic field', or (perhaps most provocatively) the 'soul-field'.' Like the magnetic (or electrical, or gravitational, etc.,) field, the soul-field depends for its existence on the generating physical object; but like those other fields it is distinct from the object rather than identical with it. Like them, also, it is no mere epiphenomenon; it acts upon its generator as well as being affected by it. This account would appear to succeed in making thought-processes depend upon brain-processes in the way in which they ought to depend on them - but how, it may be asked, does it give any help in conceiving personal survival? To destroy a magnetic field we have only to destroy, or sufficiently damage, the magnet; doesn't it follow that the destruction or death of the generating organism suffices to bring about the cessation of its soul-field? There is indeed an anology, but it should be noted that in either case the continuing dependence of the field on the generating body is a contingent matter of fact and not a necessary truth of logic. And it is readily conceivable 1 While it is mentioned here for the sake of completeness, libertarianism is not a major issue in the present paper. 2 This sentence is taken from my paper, 'The Souls of Beasts and Men', Religious Studies, IO (1974) (cited hereafter as 'Souls'), p. 272. 3 The word 'soul' has problematic connotations, but there seems to be nothing better. Mind' is preferable for humans but misleading as applied to animals. The only merit of' psychoid' or 'entelechy' is that these words lack any ordinary usage and are probably too ugly ever to acquire one. The religious connotations of 'soul' may be bothersome - but I, who am prepared to speak of the souls of slugs, gnats, and termites, can scarcely be accused of trying to exploit them!</page><page sequence="4">476 WILLIAM HASKER that things should be otherwise. For instance, it is conceivable that a field initially generated by some physical object could thereafter become self sustaining, so that it can continue to exist after the generating object has disappeared. Surprisingly, there is a plausible example of this within physics, in the recently developed 'black hole' theory. According to Roger Penrose, 'After the body has collapsed in, it is better to think of the black hole as a self-sustaining gravitational field in its own right. It has no further use for the body which originally built it!'1 Another possibility, perhaps even more relevant for our present purpose, is that when the generator ceases to function some other entity or agency takes over and sustains the field in being. Here the theological context has a bearing on what is possible: no doubt an almighty God could annihilate all of the electromagnets in a particle accelerator, and instantaneously replace them with others, while causing the identical field to persist in being. Or he could simply grant to the field the power to sustain itself without a material generator. Perhaps there is no reason why God would do such a thing. But we think there is indeed a reason for him to concern himself with the continued existence of rational souls - and if he is so concerned, surely it does not lie beyond his power to preserve them alive. I hope this will suffice to convey some kind of initial understanding of the view I am presenting. The most illuminating name I have found for this view is 'emergentism', referring to the 'emergence' of the soul-field as a result of the functioning of the generating organism.2 (I am not, however, committed by this to any of the broader metaphysical speculations associated with 'emergent evolution'.) But supposing that the view has been made initially intelligible, what reason is there to suppose that it, or something like it, might be true? Of course I cannot claim to show here that it is true; at most I hope to commend it as a viable candidate for further consideration. I shall attempt to do this by arguing the merits of emergentism first in comparison with dualism, and then in comparison with mind-body identity theory. II Why, then, is emergentism superior to dualism as a mind-body theory? There are several reasons, no one of them, perhaps, conclusive in itself but 1 'Black Holes', in Cosmologv Now, ed. Laurie John (New York: Taplinger, 1976), p. 124. 2 The conscious field is emergent roughly in the sense explicated by P. E. Meehl and Wilfrid Sellars ('The Concept of Emergence', in Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. I, ed. H. Feigl et al., Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, I956, pp. 239-52). That is to say: the field manifests itself as a consequence of a certain functional integration of living matter, and is required for an adequate theoretical description of certain organisms because it affects their behaviour; i.e. the ordinary laws of chemistry and physics, adequate in inorganic contexts, will no longer suffice for the explanation of description of this behaviour. My version of emergentism diverges from the Meehl-Sellars analysis in that they assume, as I do not, that the behaviour of these organisms (including human beings) will be entirely predictable on the basis of emergent (but still deterministic) laws.</page><page sequence="5">EMERGENTISM 477 together constituting an impressive case. The first reason is this: emergentism lends itself much more readily than dualism to an intelligible conception of mind-body interaction. I do not want to over-stress the difficulties of dualism with regard to interaction. The disparity of cause and effect in mind-body interaction is a conclusive objection to dualism only if one presupposes a rationalistic doctrine of causation which cannot be maintained in other cases. Nonetheless, the difficulties are well known. And emergentism offers at least two advantages in making interaction more readily intelligible. First, it is not a case, as with dualism, of an interaction between entirely disparate substances which are only accidentally related. The soul-field is generated by the biological organism; its identity is determined, at least initially, by the fact that it is the soul-field of that particular organism. Furthermore, the analogy of the 'field' supports the claim of two-way interaction between minds and bodies - the movements of a magnet (e.g., in an electric motor) both affect and are affected by its associated magnetic field. The problem, if there is one, lies not in seeing how the soul-field can interact with its organism but in seeing how it can exist, after death, without such interaction. The second advantage of emergentism is closely related to this. It makes intelligible, in a way dualism does not, the overall dependence of consciousness upon brain processes. To be sure, dualism readily explains certain types of dependence. Clearly, sensory experiences must be mediated to the conscious mind via the brain; thus an impairment in brain function can deprive the mind of those experiences. It is universally assumed that memory is carried in some sort of brain traces, and if this is so then a disruption of brain function could deprive the conscious mind of recourse to those memories. (This of course creates difficulties about the memories - and therefore, on some views, about the identity - of the mind in a disembodied state. I will not pursue this problem here.) Obviously, also, brain misfunction could interrupt the communication between the conscious mind and the effector muscles, rendering voluntary bodily action impossible. But, on the dualistic view, why should consciousness itself be interrupted by drugs, or a blow on the head, or by the need for sleep? And why should reasoning, generally thought of as the distinctive activity of the conscious mind, be interrupted by such physical disturbances? The natural conclusion from the dualistic hypothesis would seem to be that consciousness should continue unabated during such times - deprived, to be sure, of fresh sensory input and of motor action, and perhaps also of some memories.' It seems that by making mind essentially independent of brain rather than dependent on it, dualism deprives itself of 1 Eccles takes an interesting line here. During sleep and unconsciousness the self-conscious mind finds there is nothing to read out [from the brain] ... Suddenly it is deprived of data and this is unconsciousness. Reading nothing gives nothing.' But he also suggests that 'the self-conscious mind has probably been, as it were, probing over or scanning over a cerebral cortex all through the sleep, searching for any modules that are open and can be utilized for an experience' (The Self and Its Brain, p. 37 I). The 'conscious mind', then, is intensively active all during the time when it is unconscious!</page><page sequence="6">478 WILLIAM HASKER a ready explanation for the kinds of dependency that we actually find. Presurnably the dualist can contrive some sort of auxiliary hypothesis to account for this dependency. But I suspect that most such hypotheses will have a strong ad hoc flavor which is symptomatic of the artificiality of the whole scheme. Either that, or they will make mind dependent on brain in a way that undermines the independence which is the hallmark of dualism. Emergentism, recognizing the dependence from the beginning, is completely free of such difficulties. The third advantage of emergentism over dualism lies in its ability to deal with the question of the souls of animals. I have dealt with this topic elsewhere;' here I will limit myself to recapitulating a few of the main points. If dualism is true, then at least the higher animals must possess minds, or souls, in some sense at least closely analogous to that in which humans are said to possess them. It is out of the question for us to say, with Descartes, that animals are mere automata and have no feelings whatever. We can also rule out the occasionally heard suggestion that while in humans it is the mind or soul which has feelings in animals it is merely the biological organs which have them. To admit that biological organs can have feelings without the aid of a mind or soul is to render the soul redundant also in the human case; it undercuts the philosophical motivation for accepting dualism in the first place. But while we can't follow Descartes in making animals into automata, we can appreciate the difficulties which led him to take this step. The difficulties of accounting for 'animal soul' within the dualistic scheme are formidable. Presumably we do not want to have it that the beasts are immortal - but in the Cartesian scheme, at least, there seems to be no way of avoiding this that is not clearly ad hoc. There is also the problem of how the souls of animals originate. Presumably they cannot be replicated through biological reproduction. Traditionally the souls of human beings were held to be created individually by God, but it places a strain on one's credulity to affirm this in the case of slugs, gnats, and termites. The problem of the origin of souls is particularly awkward in the case of organisms which can be cut in pieces each of which will develop into a complete organism (e.g., starfish). At the beginning of the process, there is one organism and one soul; at the end there are two organisms, and, presumably, two souls. But how can we account for this? Did the knife which cut off a piece of the creature's body also excise a chunk of its non-extended soul? There is also the point that there does not seem to be any natural or plausible way to fit Cartesian souls into the story of biological evolution.2 I 'Souls', pp. 265-7. 2 See 'Souls', p. 267. The relationship of dualism to evolution is extensively discussed by Popper in The Self and Its Brain. But Popper's dualism is definitely not Cartesian, and it may well be compatible with the emergentism discussed in the present paper.</page><page sequence="7">EMERGENTISM 479 The general silence of dualists on these points hardly speaks well for their theory. And once again, emergentism is completely free of these difficulties. For emergentism, the appearance of a progressively more complex conscious ness is the natural result of the developing complexity of organisms and their nervous systems. No special acts of 'soul-creation' are required, nor any special explanation of why the consciousness of an animal ceases when it dies. The eternal existence which faith affirms for the human person is grounded, not on a 'natural immortality' which is possessed by the human soul, but rather on the special concern of the Creator to preserve that which he has made in his own image. I conclude that emergentism has impressive, perhaps decisive, advantages when compared with dualism. For dualism the relation of mind and body is external and accidental; for emergentism it is organic and essential. There is no straightforward 'crucial experiment' which will decide between them, but I think the considerations adduced above tend to show that emergentism provides a better fit with the natural facts of our existence. III But it will be small satisfaction to triumph over dualism if this means falling into the arms of materialism. Materialism and emergentism are agreed that the potential for conscious experience lies somehow hidden in the recesses of the material stuff of the world. Where they differ is in how this potential is realized. According to emergentism ordinary matter, when appropriately arranged in the form of a living organism, generates a conscious field; it is this field which is the subject of awareness, and mental events and processes are events and processes in the conscious field. Materialism's view is simpler: the biological organism itself simply is aware; mental events and processes are identical with events and processes in the nervous system. Now it would seem that our previous discussion has left the materialist well placed. He is able to appropriate for his own use all of the arguments urged on behalf of emergentism as against dualism, and he can proceed a step further and argue that the emergentist's 'field' is as unnecessary as the dualist's 'thinking substance'. Let us lather up again, he seems to be saying, and take one more swipe with Occam's Razor! Previously we rejected physicalism, identity theories, etc. on the ground that these views are incompatible with personal survival. But while this may be an excellent reason for concluding that these views are unserviceable for theology, a great many philosophers would not regard it as having any relevance to the truth of the views. And it has to be something less than satisfactory if one is finally forced to confess that he holds a certain metaphysical view because, and only because, it seems to comport better with his religious beliefs than do alternative views. While a great deal needs to be said about this I will limit myself here to</page><page sequence="8">480 WILLIAM HASKER pointing out one problem which, I will allege, cannot readily be solved by the standard versions of materialism and identity theory - a problem which, I will argue, requires for its solution the postulation of a conscious field or something like a conscious field. Briefly stated, I contend that materialism cannot account for the unity of consciousness. By this I do not mean the unity of consciousness as construed in a Cartesian or Kantian or some other sense which might itself be subject to challenge; I refer simply to the unity which is an experienced fact of our everyday lives. As an example, I cite my present visual field: I am presently aware of a rather large amount of visual data from my immediate surroundings. These data include the visual impression of a pair of bookcases containing a large number of books of different sizes, shapes, and colours, as well as objects piled on top of the bookcases, a wall behind them, and (out on the fringe of my visual field) a pair of windows and the vaguely sensed (because unfocused) objects beyond them. All this I observe without scanning or refocusing my eyes: momentarily, as it were. This visual field is not 'unified' in any interesting aesthetic sense; nevertheless, I do experience it as a unity rather than as a collection of unrelated data. None of this, I take it, is at all unusual; any reader can easily verify for himself that he also possesses a unified visual field. Nevertheless, I am going to argue that just these simple facts of perceptual experience canot be accounted for by materialism. In order to construct this argument, it will be helpful to make certain stipulations concerning the materialist view in question - stipulations which will, I think, be accepted by anyone who holds an identity theory. The basic idea ofthe theoryis that the brain is a computer-like network of electrochemical interconnections, processing sensory data as a computer processes information. Each item of information held within the brain is modelled in the physical state of some sub-unit of the brain. There is not conscious awareness of every item of information the brain contains, but awareness when it occurs is identical with some part of the brain's being in the appropriate physical state. I will not rehearse here the objections to localizing conscious states, nor will I claim that the notion of a brain-state's being identical with a conscious state is unintelligible. Rather, I will take a specific conscious state - the state I am in when I am aware of my visual field, as described above - and ask what physical entity it is that is in the state. The question is surprisingly difficult for the materialist to answer. What, then, is involved in my being aware of my visual field? In line with the stipulations made above, each item of information contained in my visual field is modelled in the physical state of some sub-unit of my brain. Just how this is done awaits discovery by the brain scientists; it need not concern us here. But in view of the large amount of information involved it may be reasonable to assume that the modelling of the information occupies a significant portion of the visual cortex.</page><page sequence="9">EMERGENTISM 48I But what is it that is aware of the field? I am, of course - but not all of me, that is of my body, is relevant to this awareness. No doubt we will say, if we are going to be materialists, that it is my brain which has the awareness. But not even all of my brain need be involved. Let V be the smallest part of my brain which contains the modelling of the information from my visual field. The existence and functioning of V may or may not be sufficient for my having the awareness of the field. But it clearly is necessary for the awareness, since if part of V is not functioning some of the information content of the field will be lost. Shall we say, then, that it is V which is aware of the visual field? Perhaps so, but we need to consider the composition of V. In the light of the computer analogy sketched above, we can say that V is a whole composed of biological parts. Many of these parts model information from various parts of the visual field. But no proper part of V models all of this information, so it is not possible for any of these parts to be aware of the (entire) visual field. But if V is a whole composed of parts each of which is not aware of the visual field, how can V itself be aware of it? Is it that each sub-unit is aware of the information it contains, and that in virtue of this V is aware of the entire field? That is as if one were to say that each student in a class knows the answer to one question on an examination, and that in virtue of this the entire class knows the material perfectly! It is true that the members of the class are able, working together, to reproduce all of the information, but there may in fact be no one at all who knows or is aware of all of it. The point is simply that the kind of awareness we are discussing is essentially unitary, and it makes no sense to suggest that it may be 'parcelled out' to entities each of which does not have the awareness. A person's being aware of a complex fact cannot consist of parts of the person being aware of parts of the fact. A conjunction of partial awareness does not add up to a total awareness.' I am not, by the way, ruling out the possibility that there may be multiple, mutually inaccessible consciousnesses 'inhabiting' the same body. It seems to me that not only is this conceptually possible but there is significant I This point was seen clearly by Kant (Critique of Pure Reason, tr. N. K. Smith, New York: St Martin's, I965, p. 335): 'Every composite substance is an aggregate of several substances, and the action of a composite, or whatever inheres in it as thus composite, is an aggregate of several actions or accidents, distributed among the plurality of the substances. Now an effect which arises from the concurrence of many acting substances is indeed possible, namely, when this effect is external only (as, for instance, the motion of a body is the combined motion of all its parts). But with thoughts, as internal accidents belonging to a thinking being, it is different. For suppose it be the composite that thinks: Then every part of it would be a part of the thought, and only all of them taken together would contain the whole thought. But this cannot consistently be maintained. For representations (for instance, the single words of a verse), distributed among different beings, never make up a whole thought (a verse), and it is therefore impossible that a thought should inhere in what is essentiaJl composite. It is therefore possible only in a single substance, which, not being an aggregate of many, is absolutely simple.' I am not overlooking the fact that Kant describes this argument as a 'paralogism'! But it seems to me that in his subsequent discussion Kant fails entirely to refute it - at least when it is used for the limited purposes of the present paper. (I have no wish to follow Kant's 'transcendental psychologist' and make the argument the basis for a speculative proof of immortality!) I17 RES 18</page><page sequence="10">482 WILLIAM HASKER empirical evidence that it actually occurs. Such evidence may be found in the psychopathology of 'multiple personality', as well as in the data of split-brain research.' In such cases we are perplexed about the several consciousnesses which seem to be manifested, and in particular about their relationship to the supposed unitary person. But these are clearly not instances in which a person's being aware of something consists in parts of the person each having a partial awareness. There just is no single overall awareness; that is what makes the cases so perplexing. There is an objection which might occur at this point. I have supposed the modelling of the information of the visual field to be spread over a considerable region of the brain, and I have pointed out that in this case no single unit of the brain possesses all of the information so as to be able to be aware of the field as a whole. But may we not suppose that, in addition to the various sub-units which model items of information from the field, V also contains a 'scanning' mechanism, S, which collects and integrates the items of information and thus makes possible the unified awareness? Of course there is no objection to the introduction of a scanning mechanism in the brain. But note that for this mechanism to do what is required of it, it must somehow represent within itself simultaneously all of the information of the visual field. But this contravenes the assumption made earlier, that V is the smallest part of my brain which contains all of this information. Furthermore, if S does contain all of this information, we must still reflect that S is itself a whole consisting of parts - and thus the argument begins all over again, with the same result as before. I think what one naturally wants to say at this point is something like the following: It may be, indeed must be, that the information from my conscious field is distributed among a number of distinct brain-units. But this fact obviously does not make a unified consciousness impossible - it would, after all, be absurd to require that all of the information should somehow be concentrated into a mnathematical point! Rather what happens is that in consciousness the various items of information are as it were drawn together and co-presented in a unified consciousness, and this process is not frustrated by the spatial 'spread' of the information in the brain. It seems to me that something like this must be true. But note that 'consciousness', as used in the preceding paragraph, does not refer to a brain or to any part of a brain! And yet for the materialist, this is what it must be! So I repeat my question: what physical entity is it that is aware of my visual field? If materialism cannot answer this question, it is in serious difficulty. There are, so far as I can see, only two possible lines of escape from this argument. One is to claim that, contrary to what has been asserted, a person's being aware of something does consist of parts of the person being aware of 1 See Thomas Nagel, 'Brain Bisection and the Unity of Consciousness', in Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I979), pp. I47-64.</page><page sequence="11">EMERGENTISM 483 parts of the thing. Of course, the argument given above could then be applied repeatedly to the 'parts' which are the subjects of the partial awarenesses, until at last we come to the microparticles of physics, which presumably cannot be said to be aware of anything. Frankly I see no plausibility whatever in this line of thinking, and since I am also unaware of any arguments in support of it there is no point in my discussing it further. The other line of escape is to reject the demand, which is implicit in the discussion to this point, that the properties attributed to the brain (or some part thereof such as V or S) be accounted for in terms of properties of, and relations between, its parts. This demand, which is indeed crucial to the argument, is perhaps most clearly expressed in Wilfrid Sellars' principle of reducibility, which he states as follows: If an object is in a strict sense a system of objects, then every property of the object must consist in the fact that its constituents have such and such qualities and stand in such and such relations, or roughly, every property of a system of objects consists of properties of, and relations between, its constituents.' This principle allows a brick wall to be red because its redness consists of (i.e., is definable in terms of) the redness of its constituent bricks, and it allows for a construction made of bits of wood to be a ladder because its being a ladder is definable in terms of its parts having such-and-such relations to each other. But it does not allow the coloured physical objects of ordinary experience to be systems composed of microphysical particles, for such particles have no properties in terms of which (for example) the property being pink could be defined. (This of course is Eddington's 'two tables' problem; Sellars' principle of reducibility has the effect of focusing this problem very sharply.) With regard to the justification of this principle, Sellars says: A defence of this principle would take one to the very heart of the philosophy of logic, relating, as it does, the functional calculus to the calculus of individuals. I have as yet published no such defence, but have simply stated that I find the principle in accordance with my logical intuitions. 2 And indeed the principle does seem intuitively sound - it seems, in fact, to be the only way of maintaining an intelligible connection between the properties we ascribe to wholes and the properties of their parts. Note that the principle applies to any object which is 'in a strict sense a system of objects' - such, that is, that there is no such thing as the object 'over and I 'Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man' (hereafter PSIM), in Science, Perception and Reality (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963), p. 27. Sellars' principle is equivalent to the major premise of Kant's argument cited in note I, p. 48I. Sellars may, however, have left himself open to misunderstanding by calling this a principle of reducibility. As he notes, philosophers of science have often spoken of 'reduction' as a relationship which may hold between conceptual frameworks (e.g., scientific theories), whereas Sellars' principle 'concerns the internal structure of coneptual frameworks, and belongs, properly speaking, to logic or general ontology, rather than to the philosophy of science' ('Science Sense Impressions, and Sensa' (hereafter SSIS), Review of Metaphysics, 24 (197 ), 41 I.) It is also important to see that this principle is compatible with 'emergence' as explicated by Meehl and Sellars (see note 2, p. 476).

When one has enumerated the properties which the object has in virtue of the properties of its various parts and the relations which obtain between them (i.e., which are deducible from those properties and relations), then one has exhausted the properties of the object. What could be meant by the claim that the object has properties other than these?1 And there is an additional reason why a mind-brain identity theorist ought to be reluctant to ascribe to the brain properties which violate this principle. For the strong positive analogy between computer and brain lies at the very heart of all current versions of identity theory. But a computer very definitely is 'in a strict sense a system of objects'; to attribute to a computer 'holistic' properties which are not definable in terms of the properties of, and relations between, its constituents is to indulge in confused, anthropomorphic thinking. For the identity theorist to reject the principle of reducibility as applied to the brain is to dig a conceptual ditch between brain and computer which is extremely damaging to this crucial analogy. Give the principle of reducibility, we can draw the following inference: That thing, whatever it is, which is aware of my visual field is not a whole consisting of physical parts. For it has a property (namely, the awareness in question) which does not consist in (i.e., is not definable in terms of) such parts having properties and standing in relations. If the 'parts' in question are the particles of microphysics, then they cannot meaningfully be said to be aware of anything. But even if the parts are 'brain-units', as discussed above, and even if we were to concede (as we really should not), that each brain-unit may be said to be aware of the item of information which it models, it is still impossible to construct the needed definition. For the only kind of definition which would be possible, would be equivalent to a suggestion we have already considered and rejected: the suggestion that my being aware of my visual field is definable as the separate brain-units within my skull each being aware of some tiny part of that field. I take it as evident that no such definition is acceptable. T4his seems to constitute a fairly formidable difficulty for materialism. My being aware of my visual field is a fact that materialism must account for. Such an account would have to define my being aware in terms of properties or relations of the physical parts of which, according to materialism, I consist. But no such definition is possible, so it looks as though the materialist will have to deny outright that I am aware of my visual field. Sellars' own answer to this2 exploits the theme - a fundamental one in his 1 Except for relational properties. As Sellars notes, a formulation of the principle which applies to these would have to be more complex - but the points at issue here would not be affected (SSIS, p. 393, n. 4). 2 Perhaps I should not say that Sellars presents an answer to the problem of the unity of consciousness, since he does not discuss this problem as such. He is concerned rather with the problem of locating, in</page><page sequence="13">EMERGENTISM 485 philosophy - of the contrast between the 'Manifest Image' and the 'Scientific Image' of man-in-the-world. The Manifest Image is, roughly, the ordinary, common-sense way in which we humans normally regard ourselves; it is refined and developed in ordinary-language philosophy as well as in the ' perennial philosophy' of the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition. The Scientific Image, on the other hand, is the still-evolving picture of man-in-the-world derived from modern theoretical science; the 'final' scientific image, as yet but dimly glimpsed, is that account which an ideal community of scientists would (hopefully, will!) agree on in the long run. The relation between the two Images, for Sellars, is that between appearance and reality: the final truth about the way things are is given by the Scientific Image but a crucial test of the adequacy of the Scientific Image is its ability to explain the Manifest Image - that is, it must be able to explain how and why it is that we humans naturally regard ourselves and our world in the way characterized by the Manifest Image.' Now does this work in the present case? Sellars is fully aware that 'is aware of his visual field' - or, to switch to his favorite example, 'senses redly'2 -is a predicate which takes a person as its subject and which cannot be defined in the way described above, in terms of properties and relations of parts of persons. That is to say, this is so in the Manifest Image. In the Scientific Image, on the other hand, persons as simple logical subjects do not exist, and it follows that in the Scientific Image it cannot be said that anyone senses-redly in the sense which this phrase has in the Manifest Image. But just as, in the Scientific Image, our manifest concept of a person has as a counterpart the concept of a person as a system of scientific objects, so our concept of sensing-redly has a counterpart which (unlike our manifest concept of sensing-redly) takes as subject a person conceived as a system of scientific objects and which can be defined in terms of the properties and relations ofthose objects. The original difficulty, Sellars would say, arose because we tried to combine the concepts of sensing and awareness from the Manifest Image with the conception of man as a system of physical objects in the Scientific Image. Once we see that the shift in the conception of a person requires a corresponding shift in the conceptions of sensing and awareness, the problem disappears.3 If all this is acceptable, then the problem has been solved. But is the solution intelligible? My being aware of my visual field is simply a fact of my experience. It would seem that it is impossible - and here Sellars would the Scientific Image, the 'ultimate homogeneity' of sensory qualities such as colour. But if Sellars' solution of this problem should turn out to be satisfactory, it would also solve the problem of the unity of consciousness. 1 See PSIM; also, 'Phenomenalism' (in Science, Perception, and Reality), pp. 95-I05, and SSIS, pp. 406 ff. 2 The use of this and similar expressions reflects Sellars' commitment to an 'adverbial' analysis of the objects of sensing. This is important for Sellars' overall strategy, but makes no difference to the present discussion. Except for the awkwardness involved, I could have written all along' is-aware-visual-field-ishly'. 3 SSIS, pp. 429-40</page><page sequence="14">486 WILLIAM HASKER agree - to define this awareness in terms of properties and relations of my physical constituents. I am told, however, that the ultimate Scientific Image will contain a 'successor concept' to my present concept of 'being aware'. This successor concept can be used to make the same sorts of reports as I now make by saying that I am aware of my visual field; the only difference specified between them is that the successor concept will be definable, as my current concept is not, in terms of properties and relations of my physical components. How am I to understand this? It would seem that if this successor concept is very closely analogous to my present concept of awareness, then the attempt to define it would be liable to exactly the same objection: a person's having an awareness does not consist in parts of the person having parts of the awareness. Sellars would admit this objection as decisive, given our present concept of awareness (i.e., in the Manifest Image). But when I know that I am aware of my visual field, it is the property expressed by this Manifest-Image predicate which enters into the proposition which I know to be true; Sellars' reply, in spite of all hedging, really amounts to saying that this proposition which I think I know is in fact false, that there really is nothing which has the awareness which I mistakenly think I have. Or rather, it is not I who think this, but there is something which mistakenly thinks that it is 'I', and mistakenly supposes itself to have this experience, which in reality nothing has - but I think I have overrun the limits of intelligible discourse. The point is of course a Cartesian one: I may be mistaken in some of the properties I take physical objects to have, I may be mistaken even in thinking that there are physical objects at all - but I cannot be mistaken in thinking that I think this. I am strongly tempted to borrow a phrase from Sellars and characterize his solution to this problem as a piece of 'verbal magic', whose only function is to obscure the fact that on his view there is nothing at all which has the experiences which I experience myself as having.1 There can be found in Sellars' writings on this subject at least a suggestion of another kind of solution to our problem. The solution is not one that Sellars himself would accept, but it is nevertheless worth pursuing. In discussing the significance of his principle of reducibility, he says: For, telling us, as it does, that if an object is (as contrasted with is correlated with) a whole of parts, its having P consists in its parts having properties and standing 1 The phrase 'verbal magic' is applied by Sellars to Quine (SSIS, p. 398, note 8). It should be noted that in SSIS (pp. 435-40) Sellars is at pains to refute Cornman's claim that according to Sellars, 'If the scientific image is correct, then nothing, and afortiori no person, has the property of sensing redly.' But if the words in the quoted sentence are given their ordinary interpretation, as used in the Manifest Image (and no other use has been given to them, though the possibility of another use, in the Scientific Image, has been suggested), Cornman's inference from Sellars' position is justified. Sellars comes closest to seeing the problem of the unity of consciousness in his discussion of Kant's second paralogism (note I, p. 48 I above; Sellars' discussion is in' Metaphysics and the Concept ofa Person', in Essays in Philosophy and Its History (Dordrecht: Reidel, I974), pp. 2I4-41). Speaking of Kant, he says: 'It is, he argues, indeed true that the subject of thought cannot be a many in the sense of many subjects of thought... But, Kant points out, it does not follow that the "I" which thinks cannot be a plurality or system' (p. 239). No, this does not follow - unless, that is, one accepts the principle of reducibility!</page><page sequence="15">EMERGENTISM 487 in relations, it also tells us that if an object has a property which violates the principle, then in that context it is correlated with rather than consists of the 'parts'.' Let us apply this to the problem we have been discussing. Since I am aware of my visual field, there must be something that has this awareness. This thing, whatever it is, cannot be identical with the brain, considered as 'a whole of physical parts', for the definability requirement cannot be met. The thing which is aware of my visual field must, then, be something which is correlated with the physical components of the brain but which does not consist of those components. That is to say: whenever the brain components are in such-and-such a state, the subject of awareness (whatever that may be) will be in a corresponding state - yet the 'subject' is not the whole consisting of those components, but rather something else. Now, at this point I wish to offer a modest proposal. Why should not the 'subject of awareness' which (as just explained) is correlated with the states and processes of the brain, be identical with the 'conscious field' of emergentism? Why not, indeed? To be sure, a good deal more was said about the conscious field in our exposition of emergentism than we have been able to derive from this suggestion of Sellars'. But I would want to claim that the two accounts are complementary - the Sellarsian argument demonstrates the necessity for postulating something like the conscious field, and emergentism offers a few suggestions about how that notion can be further developed. It is clear that my suggestion would not be acceptable to Sellars. But why not? Perhaps surprisingly, he could not object to the ontologically emergent status of the conscious field. For, in the 'sensa' which he postulates as needed to account for sense-impressions in the Scientific Image, Sellars countenances entities which are emergent in the same sense as the conscious field of emergentism.2 Rather, his objection would be to the nature of the field itself- it is just too 'mental', too similar, in spite of all differences, to a Cartesian ego, to qualify as a respectable 'scientific object '.3 And it is certain that a materialist who introduced such objects as part of his scientific account of the world could expect but faint applause from his tough-minded colleagues. But while one may admire Sellars' persistence in sticking to his materialist programme he certainly hasn't shown us, in this case, how that programme is going to succeed. And there is no reason whatever to suppose that a materialism which has been modified sufficiently to solve the problem SSIS, p. 4I I 2 Sensa exist as constituents of certain sentient organisms, but not in inorganic nature. But these organism originated from inorganic nature, so sensa must be emergent. And Sellars is quite willing to characterize his own position as 'emergentist' (SSIS, p. 393). 3 Clearly the conscious field is not 'physical2', that is, it is not definable 'in terms of theoretical primitives necessary and sufficient to describe non-living matter'. Arguably, however, it might be 'physical1', that is, belonging to the 'spatio-temporal-causal order' (SSIS, p. 393). But Sellars contends (plausibly, I think) that a 'physical theory' which includes within its domain irreducibly intentional mental acts and their subjects would be 'physical' only in a trivial sense (see SSIS, pp. 402, 409, 420-4, 439, 446).</page><page sequence="16">488 WILLIAM HASKER of the unity of consciousness will be ontologically more economical than emergentism. IV It is time to sum up. In considering the relationship between theology and current speculation on the mind-body problem, we suggested that a theologically useful solution to this problem must meet two requirements: it must recognize the intimate connection between mind and brain and yet distinguish them in some way that makes personal survival intelligible. The theory of emergentism was presented as satisfying both of these demands. It was claimed that this theory is superior to dualism primarily because dual ism does not adequately account for the mind's dependence on the body. Emergentism is preferable to materialism, not only because materialism is inconsistent with immortality, but also because of materialism's difficulty in accounting for the unity of consciousness. I claim, then, that on both theological and philosophical grounds emergentism merits serious attention as a solution to the mind-body problem.</page></plain_text>
