Keywords Cañarían rock art • Libyco-Berber script • Indigenous knowledge • Insular colonization • African prehistory Introduction More than 130 years ago, the first examples of the Libyco-Berber script were re- discovered in the Canary Islands. Since then, generations of scholars and others have searched for and documented new inscriptions and sought to translate them. The level of research differs from island to island; while we have a satisfying quantity of data from Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, El Hierro, and La Gomera, we know of only one inscription each from Tenerife and from La Palma.1 In this sense, some of the statements developed in this paper are provisional and we expect they will be modified by new discoveries. We will analyze the connection between the Canary Islands and North Africa and the historiography of Cañarían rock art, paying special attention to the evolution of research on the Libyco-Berber inscriptions of the islands from a historical and diachronic perspective.2 We will also develop a new thesis concerning the origin of the Libyco-Berber script, based on discoveries of inscriptions on the Canary Islands and in Morocco (Pichler and Rodrigue 2003; Pichler 2007). In light of this new thesis, we propose a diachronic hypothesis for the ancient colonization of the Canary Islands, which we argue took place in two different moments but with Libyan- Berber populations in both cases. It is important to make clear that this paper does not refer to findings at other rock art sites documented in the Canary Islands during the nineteenth century and the period of the Provincial Comissioners. This has already been addressed in chapters I and X of the monograph by Mederos Martin et al. (2003: 23-55, 223-270), in chapter VII of Ab initio (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004), and in the book Arqueología y franquismo en Canarias (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). In the specific case of some rock art sites, such as the El Julan engravings, see the work by Aquilino Padrón (1874). The Connection between the Canary Islands and North Africa From a historiographie perspective, the relationship between the indigenous Cañarían population and North Africa dates back to the second half of the fourteenth century AD when, following the rediscovery of the Canary Islands, the 1 In the case of La Gomera, it is important to highlight the recently discovered archeological site of "Las Toscas del Guirre," due to the many inscriptions documented, now under research (Navarro Mederos et al. 2006). 2 In the present paper, we have used the concept "inscription" as shorthand for alphabetic inscriptions and "rock art" for spirals, sinuous lines, and other shapes. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="3">AfrArchaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 15 indigenous people of the islands were first linked to the inhabitants of Africa through the Judeo-Christian tradition and the establishment of ethnographic and linguistic parallels. This approach would remain relatively stable until the mid-nineteenth century. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the emergence of evolutionism, archeology, physical anthropology, and the social construction of racial classifica- tions would make "race" the defining element in the diffusionist models subsequently outlined, a feature that had a decisive impact on the Europeanization of the Guanches (the name used to designate the ancient inhabitants of Tenerife, although, in the nineteenth century, it was used as a general term to designate the inhabitants of the Cañarían Archipelago) and the dismissal of the Canaries- African connection. In this context, a relationship was advocated between the Guanches and certain (Celtic Iberian) European cultures, as this was the only way to link the indigenous Cañarían people to world history. As Fernando Estévez Gozález (1987:100, 163) and others have pointed out, the evolutionist theory developed in Europe - and assimilated by the Cañarían authors - placed non- Western societies outside history. Within these coordinates, only certain ancient civilizations could claim an honorable position in the history of the human race. This is why Cañarían authors emphasized the relationship between the indigenous Cañarían people and the founders of European classical civilizations. Later, after the Spanish Civil War, the rise of culture-historicism and the changes affecting archeology in the Canary Islands as a result of nationalism and institutionalization (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007) were factors that would eventually enable diffiisionist models to emerge. This led to the establishment of the concept of "archeological culture." However, the issue of race did not disappear, as this was another defining feature of the diffiisionist thesis in vogue at the time. As a result of the racial perception of the prehistory of the Canary Islands, and of the nationalism of the archeology developed in the islands, the Canarian-African connection was recovered, although it now focused on the Sahara and on links with the so-called "Iberic-Mauritanian" and "Iberic-Saharan cultures."3 The current situation is at something of an impasse, since recent research offers disparate solutions to the problem of locating the ancient inhabitants of the Archipelago. Some works advocate North African origins but locate the homeland in areas other than those proposed by the Francoist archeologists. Others insist on the Saharan roots of the first settlers, especially for islands such as La Palma and Tenerife, on the multiethnic nature of the indigenous Cañarían people, or represent attempts to revive the Phoenician-Punic option first developed in the late nineteenth century. Therefore, despite the consolidation of the Canarian-African relationship in recent decades, there remains no consensus in the literature on when the islands were settled and colonized, where the first inhabitants came from, and how they arrived. 3 According to Martínez Santa-Olalla (1946:54-56), the Iberian-Mauritanian, dated to the 3rd millennium BC, was defined by the polished industry, by the rudimentary bone industry and by a pottery of dull glaze, profusely decorated and stamped with shells. The Iberian-Saharan culture, on the other hand, was dated to the beginnings of the second half of the 3rd millennium BC,, being defined by flint work, by a geometric and colored ceramic, by a better bone industry and by polished stone work. £} Springer</page><page sequence="4">16 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13^1 The First Phase: Questioning the Knowledge of Writing As stated above, from a historiographical perspective, the relationship between the indigenous Cañarían population and North Africa dates back to the second half of the fourteenth century when, following the rediscovery of the Canary Islands, the indigenous people of the islands were first linked to the inhabitants of the neighboring continent through the Judeo-Christian tradition and the establishment of ethnographic and linguistic parallels. This approach would remain relatively stable until the mid-nineteenth century. Nevertheless, there are virtually no specific references to rock art in the ethnohistoric documents from this period, a fact that can be explained by the nature of the sources in question as well as the degenerationist and Judeo-Christian world view they reflected (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004). The first written sources did not reflect indigenous Cañarían knowledge as it existed prior to the territorial invasion of the Canary Islands by the Normans and Castilians among others, which lead to the imposition of a distinctive, dominant culture. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries marked the beginning of the exploration and colonization of much of the world by Western European countries. Sailors had begun to meet groups of indigenous peoples in the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific, as well as the Cañarían people. Descriptions of native peoples and their customs started to circulate around Europe, and items of native material culture such as tools and clothing were brought back by travelers and displayed as curiosities. At first, the discovery of peoples who had no knowledge of metal and customs that contradicted Christian teachings seemed to confirm the medieval vision claiming that groups from outside the Middle East were furthest from divine revelation and the most morally and technologically backward (Trigger 1992: 58-61; Farrujia de la Rosa 2004: 36-38). In the case of äie Canary Islands, the idea of the technical and moral degeneration of the indigenous people, reflected in the testimony of Nicoloso da Reco in 1341, would be a recurring theme in all later written ethnohistoric sources (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004: 38). The nature of the written sources and the concept of the indigenous Cañarían people as technologically backward, implied that they could not know how to write or engrave stones. Therefore, in almost all the ethnohistoric sources written between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, there are only three writers who sought to describe Cañarían rock art: Leonardo Torriani, Antonio Sedeño, and Marín de Cubas. Even in these cases, the gulf between "Western" thought and indigenous Cañarían knowledge prevented the writers from understanding the nature and significance of the examples they described (Farrujia de la Rosa 2009). In the eighteenth century, Viera y Clavijo explored Cañarían rock art in more detail, in particular the engravings in the Cave of Belmaco (La Palma), becoming the first author in Cañarían historiography to specify the physical location of a rock art site. However, his opinion on the engravings remained faithful to the worldview described above: the Cañarían indigenous people were barbaric shepherds and therefore illiterate. According to Viera y Clavijo, It was believed that certain motifs that can found inscribed on a tombstone in a beautiful cave in the Ravine of Belmaco on the island of La Palma (the house of Prince Tedote) proved that these indigenous people had some knowledge of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 17 the art of writing, but one erudite person who has examined these characters, engraved not on a movable tombstone but on a firm rock in the shape of a tomb, categorically states that the motifs are merely scribbles, games of chance or the fantasies of the ancient barbarians. (Viera and Clavijo 1967 [1772], vol. I: 156) With regard to Viera's interpretation, it is important to stress that he explicitly provided technical information, albeit vague and imprecise, on the engravings (type of support, technical execution), but no graphic information. In the Canary Islands, archeological interest in the indigenous past began nearly half a century after the works of Viera, and this period will be analyzed in the next section. The Second Phase: Rock Art and Inscriptions, Race, and Archeology Coinciding with the development of European archeology and physical anthropology in the second half of the nineteenth century, the European and particularly the French frame of reference played a crucial part in the emergence of Cañarían archeology. Archeological and anthropological research started in the Canary Islands in the second half of the nineteenth century when scientific institutions associated with both disciplines were founded: El Gabinete Científico (1877), El Museo Canario (1880), and La Sociedad Cosmológica (1881; Farrujia de la Rosa 2005b). The presence of French authors such as Sabin Berthelot and René Vemeau on the Canary Islands helped disseminate the main trends in French archeology. Berthelot lived in the islands for more than 25 years and published some of his articles in Cañarían journals (e.g., Revista de Canarias). Vemeau spent some time at El Museo Canario (Gran Cañaría) where he studied archeological materials from the ancient Cañarían populations and published some of his articles in a local journal, Revista de El Museo Canario. At the same time, some Cañarían authors, such as Gregorio Chil y Naranjo, Juan Bethencourt Alfonso, and Rosendo García Ramos had been to Paris. They visited academies and learned societies and established ongoing relationships with the leading scientific figures of the day, such as Boucher Crèvecoeur de Perthes, Armand de Quatrefages, Teodore Hamy, and Paul Broca. This ensured that French publications circulated widely throughout the Canaries. Cañarían archeological literature of the nineteenth century thus was broadly defined on the basis of a combination of evolutionist and diffusionist arguments, as in the rest of Europe. For this reason, the foreign and Cañarían intellectuals studying the indigenous Cañarían people appealed to both diffusionist and evolutionist theories to explain cultural change. It was considered inexplicable that human groups who had lived in isolation could evolve at the same pace and in the same way as groups from Africa or Europe. Diffiisionist theses, starting with the mechanism of migration, thus provided explanations for the similarities observed between the Archipelago and the place of origin or diffusion, usually located in Europe. Rock Inscriptions, the Maghreb, and the Canary Islands The study of rock art was also imbedded in the French frame of reference. French authors such as Sabin Berthelot, Louis Leon Cesar Faidherbe, and René Verneau Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">1 8 Afr Archaeol Rev (20 1 0) 27: 1 3^ 1 were interested in the study of Cañarían rock engravings, mainly the Libyco-Berber inscriptions influenced by the North African context and, above all, using the methodology developed by French archeology in the Maghreb. The florescence of archeology in this area cannot be understood outside of the French conquest of the country and the colonial politics this inaugurated, since political power found in archeology a source of information on conquest and a model for colonization. In fact, the French Ministry of War had requested the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres to set up a research program in 1833 into the history and archeology of Algeria. Consequently, fieldwork became the province of the colonial army, the official administrators, and the civil servants who took charge of locating ruins and copying down the numerous inscriptions (Sheppard 1990). Between 1830 and 1850, it was basically military officials who provided the necessary impetus for field archeology. Nevertheless, many of these functionaries had been instructed by Karl Benedikt Hase, a professor at the Polytechnic School since 1830, who had given them lessons on ancient history and taught them how to reproduce inscriptions. This meant that the archeology of the Maghreb was founded mainly on the basis of epigraphic texts rather than excavations, and it was not until 1890 that the archeological study of North Africa began to take on a separate existence (Haoui 1993; Sibeud 2001). In the Canary Islands, therefore, authors such as Berthelot, Faidherbe, and Vemeau focused on the study of Cañarían inscriptions, influenced by the scientific context of the time (see Hernández Pérez 1996; Mederos Martín et al. 2003: 23-52) and by the rediscovery of the El Man alphabetic inscriptions by Aquilino Padrón in 1873. Faidherbe (1874), Berthelot (1874), and Vemeau (1878) identified these inscriptions as Numidic (Libyan), relating them to the pre-Aryan populations that had invaded North Africa, and extended their conclusions to the study of other inscriptions in El Hierro (La Candia, La Caleta). In the case of national or Cañarían authors, this thesis was adopted by Grau Bassas (1882) and Millares Torres (1893) among others. From a methodological point of view, it is important to stress that the first graphic reproductions of the inscriptions were freehand rather than traced and that the French authors who studied them did not know the rock art sites first-hand. The first drawings of the El Júlan engravings, for example, were done by Aquilino Padrón (1874), who passed them on to Berthelot. Despite these deficiencies, the examples of rock art were soon used for sequencing Cañarían prehistory. Berthelot, in his Antiquités Canariennes (1879) for example, identified two population waves, stressing the importance of rock art to his conclusion. Following Antigüedades de Andalucía (1868) by Manuel de Góngora, and the phases which he established for Andalusia, Berthelot defined an initial prehistoric phase for the Canaries represented by the El Hierro and La Palma (Belmaco) inscriptions which are identical to those found in the southern mainland (Berthelot 1980 [1879]: 134).4 This phase was followed by a phase of megalithic construction or protohistoric phase (Berthelot 1980 [1879]: 134). For Verneau, the Semitic population wave would have been responsible for introducing Libyan inscriptions to the Canaries, although, in the case 4 René Vemeau was the first author to point out that there were no similarities at all between the El Hierro and La Palma engravings, because "Je ne puis guère voir une inscription dans les signes de l'île de la Palmé" (1881:26). In other words, contrary to Berthelot's opinion, the Belmaco engravings were ideographic, not alphabetical. £j Springer</page><page sequence="7">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13^11 19 of Gran Canaria, the French author identified a Numidian population wave influenced by his interpretation of the engravings in the Ravine of Balos (Tirajana; Verneau 1886). Manuel de Ossuna used the inscription on the Anaga Stone to argue for a Semitic presence in the Canary Islands (Farrujia de la Rosa 2002). The French authors also insisted that the inhabitants of islands such as Tenerife and La Gomera were not responsible for the Cañarían Libyco inscriptions. In their view, the Guanches, who came from a more archaic culture than the Libyans, were illiterate and could not have produced these inscriptions (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004:256-268).5 This thesis was shared by Cañarían authors such as Millares Torres (1893:6). Rock Inscriptions, Europe, and the Canary Islands The French scientific frame of reference, the study of Cañarían inscriptions in connection with the colonization of the islands, and the regionalism of Manuel de Ossuna and Juan Bethencourt Alfonso explain the links established by these authors between the Guanches on the one hand and the Celts and Iberians on the other on the basis of the Cañarían inscriptions. The El Júlan and La Dehesa (Hierro) engravings and the inscriptions in the Ravine of Balos (Gran Canaria) were particularly influential in this case. Dismissing the African option and relying on the conclusions of Canadian philologist John Campbell (1904), the two authors claimed that the El Hierro and Gran Canaria inscriptions proved that the ancient Iberians and Celts were present on the Canary Islands and that the indigenous language spoken on the islands was common to all of them. It is important to point out that the regionalist authors from Tenerife, such as Ossuna and Bethencourt, were against the politics of Leon y Castillo (the leader of the Gran Canaria Liberal Party) and defended Tenerife and its political interests and not the division of the Canary Islands into two provinces. This political positions helps explain why they argued for the original ethnic unity of the archipelago and the presence of an Atlantic civilization on the islands that was strongly Ibero-Celtic in character, thus developing the discourse used by Castilian nationalism in its centralist politics. It was critical to the regionalists to show that, despite the initial cultural diversity on the islands, they had come to constitute a single cultural entity. In this sense, Ossuna and Bethencourt did not speak of island cultures, but instead, considered the archipelago to be populated by a general Atlantic civilization (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004: 396-404). The Third Phase: Rock Art and Inscriptions, Culture-Historical Theory, and Field Archeology Following the work of Ossuna and Bethencourt, Cañarían archeological research experienced profound changes as a result of Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil 5 Similar interpretations to those outlined by the French authors can be found in other contemporary European scientific contexts, since these evolutionist ideas led many archeologists to reject the authenticity of rock paintings, considering them too advanced to have been produced by early humans (Trigger 1992: 102). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">20 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27: 1 3-41 War. The changes introduced after the nationalization of Spanish archeology and the establishment of the Comisarias Provinciales de Excavaciones Arqueológicas (Provincial Commissioners for Archaeological Excavations) had clear implications for the future of Cañarían archeology, particularly in the field of rock art or pre- Hispanic rupestrian art, as it was called in those days (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). The concept of pre-Hispanic rupestrian art is obviously incorrect. In connection with the connotations of the term "art," as Teresa Chapa Brunei (2000) has pointed out, we should bear in mind that this concept is derived from an approach that emanates from researchers and does not reflect a similar concept in the types of societies in question. A theoretical discussion on the use of the term "art" can be found in the work of Searight (2004) and Fraguas Bravo (2006). With regard to the attribute pre- Hispanic, it has already been argued that its ideological implications and the chrono- cultural inconsistency arose out of its use in the field of Cañarían prehistory (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). From a methodological point of view, the archeological fieldwork carried out by the two Cañarían Commissioners (Eastern/Western) in the 1940s and 1950s led to an increase in the discovery and documentation of rock art sites since other sites with different types of motifs featuring different techniques from the Libyco inscriptions were also documented. In addition, archeological sites began to be documented more scientifically; their geographic coordinates and the form, nature, and type of engravings were specified, and the panels were traced and photographed. From a theoretical point of view, race continued to have an impact on studies at this time, and the concept of archeological culture was introduced for the first time. Culture-historicism and the guidelines of Official or Francoist Archaeology developed during Franco's regime enabled Cañarían rock art to be used to support a Spanish nationalist discourse, by relating the spiral engravings of La Palma to those in Bronze Age Galicia. This was taken even further by linking the first examples of rock art in what was known as the Spanish Sahara to certain rock art sites in the Canaries (Iberian-Saharan Culture). On the basis of this interpretation, the Canary Islands would have been part of the great Hispanic-Saharan cultural circle. The Atlantic area (Britain, Ireland, Scotland, and Galicia) was also linked to the Canaries, mainly through the rock art sites of La Palma, emphasizing a Canarian-Celtic or Aryan connection. This pro-Germanic vision ultimately enabled a relationship between the Canaries and the Atlantic cultural circle to emerge (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). As in the 19th century, examples of rock art were also used to sequence thç prehistory of the Canary Islands, although the absence of BC radiocarbon dates and the inability to read and interpret the stratigraphy of certain archeological sites created obstacles that led to the development of diachronic sequences without archeological foundations. Contributions within this context include those of José Pérez de Barradas (1939), who included ceramics in his sequence, and Juan Alvarez Delgado (1949) who, in an attempt to develop a definitive work from a graphic point of view, defined four phases or horizons from criteria such as formal parallels observed with other relatively dated foreign sites. However, the Cañarían philologist did not consider the techniques used to execute the engravings and thus an analytical criterion with possible cultural implications was disregarded. The methodological Û Springer</page><page sequence="9">Afr Archaeol Rev (20 1 0) 27: 1 3-4 1 2 1 inconsistencies underlying the works of Alvarez Delgado are striking, given that he was one of the most prolific authors of the time working in the field of rock art, yet carried out virtually no fieldwork (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). Luis Diego Cuscoy (1968) also took rock art into consideration when sequencing Cañarían prehistory. However, as in the work of Pérez de Barradas and Alvarez Delgado, the anteriority or posteriority of new cultural horizons were not established on any factual basis and other elements of the indigenous material culture were disregarded. The theoretical presuppositions remained the same: culture-historicism and difiusionist theory. The "absence" of rock sites in Tenerife and La Gomera was attributed to the archaic culture of these islands, which in this view had been populated mainly by early Upper Paleolithic Cro-Magnon peoples, contrary to what happened in the islands mainly populated by the Mediterranean racial type, where rock art sites were more frequent. Thus, a nineteenth century perspective was adopted, influenced by evolutionism. However, unlike the nineteenth century French authors, Pérez de Barradas attributed rock inscriptions directly to the Guanches rather than the conquerors (Numidians). This made Pérez de Barradas the first author to argue that these cultural manifestations were indigenous (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). In 1964, Alvarez Delgado focused on the study of Cañarían petroglyphs with no intention of analyzing the diachronic sequence of Cañarían prehistory. On this occasion, he only studied the Libyco inscriptions found in El Hierro and Gran Canaria and those of dubious Libyco nature in Tenerife, Fuerteventura, and La Palma. However, the purpose of the study was to provide a corpus of Libyco inscriptions found in the Canaries, rather than to further knowledge of the origin, nature, and dating of such inscriptions. Continuity After the Franco Dictatorship The study of Cañarían rock art has not changed significantly since Franco's regime, a fact that can be explained by theoretical continuity and an "impasse" in certain areas of research, as Hernández Gómez et al. (2004-2005) have also pointed out.6 In the field of space-time contextualization, for example, absolute dates - though scarce and unevenly distributed among the islands - have "rejuvenated" the indigenous Cañarían people, whose arrival on the islands now dates back to the middle of the first millennium BC.7 In addition, the identity of the indigenous Cañarían people has been fragmented due to the development of a new concept of island colonization in which those who populated each island "seem" to have been colonizers with a well- defined ethnic entity (Guanches in Tenerife, Canarios in Gran Canaria, Majos in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, Gomeros in La Gomera, Bimbaches in El Hierro, and Auaritas in La Palma) of African descent (Libyan-Berber). From a research 6 The minor changes in Cañarían archeology in the aftermath of the Franco dictatorship and following the creation of the Department of Archaeology, Prehistory and Ethnology at the University of La Laguna in 1968 are discussed in Farrujia de la Rosa 2007. The indigenous penod is still denned as prehistoric, and therefore, the scientific community speaks about the "Prehistory** of the Canary Islands which lasted a relatively short time (roughly 2,000 years, from the sixth century BC to the AD fifteenth century). &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="10">22 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 standpoint, this has turned the islands into small Taif kingdoms, with all the underlying interests, not only scientific, of a new political-administrative reality in which the cabildos (the local government institutions on each island) play a significant role (see Hernando González 2006 for political and intellectual implications of this). In the specific case of rock art, the number of documented sites has increased greatly as a result of archeological field work, mainly due to the archeological work developed since the early 1980s. This has resulted in: the documentation of rock art sites on islands such as Tenerife and La Gomera, thus eliminating the belief that the absence of such archeological evidence on these islands was due to the predominance of Cro-Magnon; an increase in recorded sites of various types8; and the documentation of Libyco-Berber inscriptions on all the islands. It has been accompanied, from a methodological perspective, by the use of new technologies, particularly since the late 1990s (computerized databases of archeological sites, use of GPS, digital photography, and digital layers). Examples of rock art have also been studied with the aim of sequencing the prehistory of the islands. Illustrative examples include the work by Pellicer Catalán (1971-1972: 13-16) which, developed in the aftermath of the Franco dictatorship, reaffirmed the Saharan option; the work by Hernández Pérez (1973), which is the first PhD thesis on Cañarían rock art and once again emphasizes the Saharan and Atlantic options and, more recently, the work by Martin Rodriguez (1998) on La Palma, which proposes a periodization for the island's rock art on the basis of the evolution of decorative motifs on stratigraphically documented ceramics. Equally, from the early 1980s onwards, examples of rock art have played a genuine role in defining the Guanche identity (Libyco-Berber and Latin inscriptions, the Zanata Stone, anthropomorphs, podomorphs, spirals, etc.; Farrujia de la Rosa 2009). This has been generated, to a large extent, within a scientific context in which the historical-cultural paradigm is still dominant and theoretical reflection plays a minor role. The Origin of the Libyco-Berber Script: a New Thesis In the light of recent research, therefore, there is no doubt about the Libyco-Berber origin of the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands. But the panorama becomes more complex when trying to define the ethnic distribution on each island, the chronological moment in which the colonization took place, and if there were one or several waves of immigration. According to the thesis we propose in the following pages, the ancient or prehistoric colonization of the Canary Islands took place in two different chronological moments or waves of immigration, in light of the study of Libyco-Berber inscriptions and indigenous material culture. 8 The increased number of archeological sites has been accompanied by the emergence of studies classifying Cañarían rock art. Illustrative examples include the monograph coordinated by Tejera Gaspar and Cuenca Sanabria (1996) or the monographs by Mederos Martin et al. (2003) and Tejera Gaspar et al. (2008). £&gt; Springer</page><page sequence="11">Afr Archaeol Rev (20 1 0) 27: 1 3-4 1 23 Regarding the Libyco-Berber script, though Algerian colleagues (e.g., Hachid 2000) claim its independent invention, such an elaborate alphabetical script without any previous stage of pictographic or syllabic script would presuppose one of the most ingenious acts of invention in the history of mankind. We can find no second example worldwide. The assumption that this brilliant creator took the same signs for the same phonemes in a series of cases as the creators of the old Phoenician alphabet is beyond any credible probability. So, it seems reasonable to assume that the Libyco-Berber script was not a unique invention in the strict sense of the word but a creative adaptation. More than 90% of all researchers agree on the preference of Sumer as the probable place of origin of this script. At the beginning of the second millennium BC, the idea of the script reached the coast of the Mediterranean. At about 1700 BC the idea of a consonantal script was born in the region between Syria and the Sinai peninsulas. Out of this region, the script developed in two different directions, into the S-Semitic scripts of the Arabian Peninsula and the NW-Semitic scripts. The clear favorites for precursors among these two groups are the so-called "Thamudic" scripts and the old Phoenician script. Contact with the seafaring Phoenician people who colonized a great part of the Mediterranean coast is the most plausible scenario for transmission of the script to North Africa and the Canary Archipelago. Jürgen Untermann (1997) proved that the Phoenicians brought the script to the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula during the ninth century BC. Is it therefore plausible to presume a similar act of taking the script south of the Strait of Gibraltar (Fig. 1) We argue that it is. There are three lines of evidence we bring to bear, which support each other: the system of the script, especially the three half-vowels (Fig. 2); the timing; and the place of the transfer. While the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula took over Fig. 1 Origin of the Libyco-Berber script Ô Springer</page><page sequence="12">24 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 Fig. 2 Evolution of the vowel systems the three half-vowels from the old Phoenician alphabet and added two more vowels under Greek influence, the inhabitants south of Gibraltar kept the system of three half-vowels. In terms of timing, the development of some old Phoenician characters gives us a temporal corridor for the transfer of the system to Gibraltar between the tenth and ninth centuries BC and to North Africa about the eighth or seventh century BC. If all that we know about the development of the Libyco-Berber script is not totally wrong, we can identify the oldest inscriptions in the mountains of the High Atlas. In 2006, trial trenches were made on the Oukaimeden plateau in the High Atlas, one of them exactly in front of the famous "frise aux éléephants" which also bears one of the supposed oldest Libyco-Berber inscriptions. The radiocarbon date obtained from the charcoal of a hearth resulted in an age of 2,680±35 BP. The authors of this study summarize: "It is tempting (but dared) to establish a link between the date of this charcoal and the Libyco-Berber inscription of the frieze of elephants. (...) But this is purely hypothetical" (translation by authors El Graoui et al. 2008: 107). We agree completely with this statement. In fact, this radiocarbon date is no proof of the age of the inscriptions. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable correspondence with the age deduced from the historical evolution of script in the Mediterranean. The Libyco-Berber Script and the Canary Islands The Archaic Script The aforementioned original type of alphabet, which can be called the archaic one, spread to the East as far as the Kabylia and to the West as far as the Canary Islands. Û Springer</page><page sequence="13">Afr Archaeol Rev (20 1 0) 27: 1 3-4 1 25 Fig. 3 Expansion of the archaic alphabet The most plausible time of this transfer to the islands as deduced from the epigraphic development is the sixth century BC (Fig. 3).9 We can find these archaic inscriptions especially on El Hierro and Gran Canaria and single ones on La Gomera and La Palma. Their main features are that they are pecked (and not carved or scratched); they prefer round variants (instead of angular ones); and they occur in a clearly definable context of linear and geometric depictions, such as circles, serpentines, labyrinths, nets, etc. (Fig. 4). It is evident that this context shows striking similarities to the so-called "megalithic" repertoire of signs. During the last century DJ. Wölfel and his students tried to search for these roots of an "Atlantic culture," but we have no evidence of such a connection so far, and we do not expect to find one (Pichler 2003a, b; Farrujia de la Rosa and Arco Aguilar 2004). However, it is no secret that North African rock art provides thousands of examples which show an evident similarity to Cañarían ones (Fig. 4). It is no surprise that we can find in these archaic inscriptions personal names identical to ones from inscriptions in Morocco, for example: NGRN NGRH (RIL 441) STN STH (RIL 980) MZL MSHL (RIL 586) MSKL MSKL (RIL 713) KSN KSN (RIL 719) Who were the creators of these archaic inscriptions? Since Wölfel it was usual to ascribe the Libyco-Berber inscriptions to seafarers who made a short stop or unintentional visitors such as shipwrecked sailors: "My provisional impression is 9 In relation with the colonization of the Canary Islands and the Lybico-Berber script, see also the works of Tejera Gaspar (1993), Belmonte et al. (1998), and Springer Bunk (2001). They also develop a similar approach, but without taking into consideration the Latino-Canarian script. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="14">26 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 Fig. 4 Comparison of rock art motifs of La Palma (1-3) and Morocco (4-6) that the greatest part of the inscriptions is situated near the coast. Therefore, it seems reasonable to think of seafarers who visited the islands to bunker fresh water and to have a rest" (1940: 306, our translation). Wölfel felt confirmed in this assumption by his own translation of one line from La Caleta/El Hierro (Fig. 5): 110**+ • = LRYT = lereita = was here. However, this transliteration is not correct. The first sign, UK stands for /w/ in vertical lines, the sign for N would be = (II turned 90°). Nowak, also influenced by evolutionist thinking, took over Wölfel's ideas and resumed: "An assignment of these alphabetiform inscriptions to the original inhabitants seems to be just as bold as improbable" (1986: 70). Only a few very rough inscriptions at a greater distance from the coast were considered to be native &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="15">AfrArchaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 27 Fig. 5 Detail of inscription from La Caleta copies of inscriptions made by the inhabitants. All of these conclusions were based on a sample of some dozens of inscriptions from El Hierro only. In fact, nearly 90% of the panels on this island are situated nearer than 1 km from the coast and almost 10% are within 10 m from the coast. Nowadays we have the counter example of Fuerteventura: on this island all sites except two can be found at distances between 6 and 12 km from the coast. If we consider that the typical width of the island is between 18 and 26 km, this means a near-maximum distance of the sites from the coast. In addition, we register typical altitudes of 200-570 m: half of the sites lie on top of mountains. In view of these facts, the thesis of occasional or unintentional visitors as creators of the inscriptions is difficult to support. There is a well-known second group of inscriptions on the eastern islands of the archipelago. For a better understanding, let us first have a look on the further development in the northernmost part of Africa. The Classic Script Since the third century BC, two Numidian kingdoms developed: one of the Masaesyli and one of the Massyli. The Libyco-Berber script of this time, which can be called the classic one, was adopted as an "official script" of these kingdoms, especially used for monuments and gravestones (Fig. 6). The considerable influence of the Roman and Punic cultures upon these inscriptions is documented by a series of bilingues. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="16">28 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27: 1 3-41 ^^X30 steles ' &lt;1000steles7"V^ Fuerteventura J^ ' V ^^--^. Lanzarote.X'j / ' /^^^' '&lt;? / ^y ^ - y y Tripolltania Fig. 6 Expansion of the classic alphabet In this era, a second wave of immigration to the Canary Islands took place. Berber people who were accustomed to Roman culture and script brought a second type of inscriptions to the islands which differ from the archaic ones in three points: they are carved or scratched, they prefer angular variants, and they occur often in a context of Latin cursive inscriptions (Fig. 7). Not every scratched inscription necessarily belongs to the classic type, but there is a striking preference. The same goes for the preference of angular variants which is caused by the technique: it is much easier to scratch or carve straight lines than curved ones. The second type of alphabetic inscriptions on the Canary Islands (the Latino- Canarian type) plays an important role in dating the associated Libyco-Berber ones. The first examples of this type were discovered in the late 1980s on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Pichler widened the basis for examination and interpretation from a handful of lines to about 240 lines. As it was already demonstrated in the 1990s, this special type of cursive script, which is typical for the border territories of the Roman Empire, can be dated to the time of about Jesus Christ's birth (Pichler 1994, 1995). This is exactly the time of the colonies of Augustus in Morocco (e.g., Tingis, Lixus, Zilis,: 27 BC-14 BC) and of the Mauretanian king Juba II (25 BC-AD 23) with his crimson manufactories at Mogador and probably also in the Canary Islands. Among the Latino-Canary lines, we can find personal names which are well- known from North African inscriptions (Fig. 8): ANÍBAL HANIBAL NUFEL NUBEL/NUVEL The preferred destination of this wave of immigration was the eastern islands Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, where the classic type of script is the only one. Occasional examples seem to exist on Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and El Hierro as well. A great many of the ancient inscriptions are decipherable based on discoveries of the last decades. A basis group of the sign inventory never changed during the 2,500 years of development: U=M, +=T, -=N, ==L, O=R, ^=Y Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 29 Fig. 7 The main differences between archaic and classic inscriptions Some additional signs did not change their form and phonetic value until the invention of recent Tifinagh: C=D, II=W, X=P/F, X=S A series of further characters easily can be recognized as variants of a basic form: «=*, IA=H, nj=* In these last cases, a statistical analysis of the frequencies can help to establish assignments to phonetic values with a high degree of probability. In any case, the result must be a complete alphabet and a frequency of each character which is usual in the used language/s. In 1994 some examples of bi-scripts (Libyco-Berber and Latino-Canary) were documented on Fuerteventura (Pichler 1994). Since this time, the transcription of Libyco-Berber inscriptions in general is far beyond speculation. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="18">30 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13^1 Fig. 8 Inscriptions from Morro Pinacho and Barranco del Cavadera In the case of these bi-scripts, we can be very sure that the writer had control of both alphabets. He surely comes from a territory inside the borders of the Roman Empire, growing up with the Berbers' own script and learning a second one through contact with the Romans. Such a Romanized Berber wrote his name in Latin characters and added his filiation in Libyco-Berber characters: he acknowledged his participation in Roman culture but attested to his Berber origins as well (Fig. 9). In general, we can notice a very close connection between the Latino-Canary and the Libyco-Berber inscriptions of the Canary Islands: 1. We have some bi-scripts of the same word in both scripts on the same panel: e.g., WMKRN-AVMACURAN 2. We have examples of the same personal name in Latino-Canarian and Libyco- Berber script on different panels/sites: e.g., WSM'-VASIMA £j Springer</page><page sequence="19">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 31 I w / "3" / ' U / Fig. 9 Inscription from Cuchíllete de Buenavista 3. We have examples of Latino-Canarian lines with one Libyco-Berber character for a phoneme which cannot be represented by a Latin character (all sibilants except /s/): e.g., IUFAS (Fig. 10) 4. We can notice a distinct influence of the Libyco-Berber way of writing on some Latino-Canarian inscriptions, e.g., the direction of writing (Figs. 11 and 12). The second step of reading the Cañarían inscriptions is the transcription of the lines, mainly consisting in the addition of the unmarked vowels. This is no problem in the case of several personal names which are attested in Latin inscriptions on the Canaries: SM' SIMA or - in most cases - in North Africa: MSKL MASCAL/MASCEL In some cases, we even can translate a Libyco-Berber line: WMKRN=AVMACVRAN=son of MAKURAN (PN, male). &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="20">32 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 Fig. 10 Inscription from Cuchíllete de Buenavista The Transitional and the Tifinagh Scripts During a period of some hundred years, the transformation from the archaic to the classic alphabet consists only of minimal changes: nearly all alterations of signs can be classified as variants of the basic forms.

All phonemes, with six exceptions, were represented by totally new signs. We call this new type of alphabet Tifinagh. This change took place through a continuous process rather than suddenly. We can find examples of this transitional alphabet all over Northern Africa, from Mauritania and Morocco over Ahaggar, Adrar, and Air to the Tassili and Messak. The most obvious feature of this alphabet is the appearance of dotted signs in addition to linear ones: •• together with II ••• together with III A further characteristic is the presence of the sequence ••• O III (according to Aghali-Zakara 1999:3: "ayrey" = "I am called," followed by a personal name). We can find only one inscription from the Canary Islands which can be related to this stage of evolution of the Libyco-Berber script. It was documented at the site Llano de Zonzamas/Lanzarote (Pallares Padilla 1991:59, Fig. 13) and contains, surprisingly, the sequence ••• O III as above, but in opposite order. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="22">34 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 Fig. 13 Inscription at Llano de Zonzainas Evidence for Tifmagh is found on thousands of rock inscriptions across North Africa, but only a very few in Morocco. This last restriction may be the reason for the fact that we can find no Tifmagh inscription in the Canary Archipelago. The Colonization of the Islands: a Diachronie Hypothesis on the Basis of Libyco- Berber Inscriptions We are far from being able to give any final opinion about the situation of the whole archipelago because the level of research differs enormously from island to island. Nevertheless, examination of the Libyco-Berber inscriptions indicates a division of the Canary Islands into two episodes of Berber influence from different times, but geographically overlapping (Fig. 14). • An archaic Berber culture of the sixth century BC including El Hierro (El Man, La Caleta, etc.), parts of Gran Canaria (Barranco de Baios, Alteara, etc.), one inscription on La Palma (Cueva de Tajodeque) and probably one on La Gomera (Las Toscas del Guirre). • A Romanized Berber culture from the time of Augustus and Juba II, including Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, probably parts of Gran Canaria (Hoya Toledo, Llanos de Gamona, etc.), some inscriptions on El Hierro (Barranco de Tejeleita, Barranco Cuervo, etc.) and one inscription on Tenerife (Cabuquero).10 The 10 Some other rock art sites in Tenerife have already been related to this period by means of stylistic comparisons with several sites located in Western Sahara (Farrujia de la Rosa and García Marín 2005, 2007). &lt;ö Springer</page><page sequence="23">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13-41 35 Fig. 14 Distribution of the two main types of Libyco-Berber script on the Canary Islands connection of the inscription from Tenerife with additional linear-geometric engravings similar to those of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura increases the probability of this assignment. The assignment of the inscriptions of Gran Canaria and El Hierro is highly provisional. In addition to these two significant waves of cultural influence, we have a very small indication for contact in the era of the transitional alphabet. But, we have not the slightest indication that North African people imported the Tifinagh alphabet after the Conquest. Archeological Research and Libyco-Berber Inscriptions11 By means of the evidence of the distribution already described, we cannot exclude the possibility that immigrants reached the eastern islands and Tenerife too, in the pre-Roman period, as will be argued below. They might have left no evidence of their script on rock surfaces, any images might have been destroyed in the meantime, or perhaps any existing archeological sites have yet to be documented. The same goes for the possibility that immigrants of Romanized culture reached La Palma. Being aware of these possibilities, how does the sketch of Berber immigration fit the archeological research? Unfortunately, we have only a few radiocarbon dates for Cañarían archeological sites so far. In Tenerife, for example, the most ancient site (a habitation cave in Icod) dates to the fifth century BC (Arco Aguilar et al. 2000; Farrujia de la Rosa 2004), but it is also true that we have only one Libyco-Berber inscription for this island. Therefore, it is clear that this island was inhabited since the fifth century BC.12 In the case of La Palma, Martín Rodriguez (1992) among other authors has argued for the existence of two phases when speaking about the Berber colonization 11 The problem regarding archeological research and ancient colonization has already been addressed in detail in another publication (Farrujia de la Rosa 2004). There is another habitation cave in Tenerife, in the Ravine of La Arena, dated in the 6th century BC, but the human occupation of this ancient level has been questioned by several authors (Farrujia de la Rosa 2007). &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="24">36 Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13^41 of the island, although without the help of radiocarbon dates and focusing his research on the ceramic typology. In this island, the most ancient radiocarbon date was obtained from a wooden funeral bed (chajasco) dated to the third century BC, and as it happens in Tenerife, we only know one Libyco-Berber inscription in the island. Archeology confirms the introduction of the Archaic Berber culture to this island, but does not shed light on a second immigration. In the case of La Gomera, the material culture presents several parallels with that of Tenerife (inhabited since the first phase), although the earliest radiocarbon date is quite recent: fifth century AD. It is highly probable that this island was colonized in the first phase given the characteristics of its material culture and Libyco-Berber inscriptions recently discovered. The same thing can be said for El Hierro: the island was inhabited since the first phase, although the earliest radiocarbon date is quite recent (second century AD). There are no similarities between the material culture of the El Hierro and that of Tenerife or La Gomera. On Gran Canaria, there is valuable confirmation of the first wave of immigration: the necropolis of Arteara (Gran Canaria). This is the first example of a Cañarían rock art site with Libyco-Berber characters, anthropomorphic and geometric signs, associated with a funeral context (García Navarro et al. 2004). Schlüter Caballero (1981) dated the oldest stratum of the necropolis to the fifth century BC. The second wave of immigration has also been documented, not only with the Libyco-Berber inscriptions but also thanks to the study of the material culture, especially the ceramic idols (Fortunatae... 2004). In the case of Lanzarote, radiocarbonic dates and material culture fit perfectly with the hypothesis of an immigration during the second phase (Romanized Berber culture; Atoche Peña et al. 1995; Cabrera Pérez et al. 1999; Farrujia de la Rosa 2006), although there are several authors who have also argued a Punic colonization for this island (e.g., Atoche Peña et al. 1999; Santana Santana et al. 2002). At the archeological site of El Bebedero, the most ancient stratum has been dated to a chronological period close to the start of the Christian era (30 BC), and the material culture of this site is comprised of fragments of amphorae and different artifacts made of iron, copper, bronze, and also a vitreous fragment. The amphorae pieces come from Campania (Dressel 1A, IB, and 1C), Baetica (Dressel 20 and 23), and North Africa (Tunisian area, type Class 40). In Fuerteventura, the panorama is similar to the one already described for El Hierro and La Gomera, in the sense of a lack of information. The earliest radiocarbon date is quite recent (third century AD), but the cultural analogies existing between Fuerteventura and Lanzarote make plausible the idea of a common colonization for both insular territories, which are separated by a distance of nearly 15 km (Cabrera Pérez 1993). Conclusions Scientific research into the rock art of the Canary Islands has been characterized by an interest in issues such as timing and significance, in some cases from evolutionist approaches and, more recently, from a culture-historicist perspective. In the case of Libyco-Berber inscriptions, they have played an important role from a diachronic &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="25">Afr Archaeol Rev (2010) 27:13^1 37 point of view and been studied with the aim of sequencing the prehistory of the islands. In recent years, this has been accompanied by the emergence of numerous publications produced outside research programs and divorced from theoretical discussion. These have been characterized by the isolated study of certain rock art sites consisting of small-scale historical units (district, ravine, etc.), the failure in most cases to incorporate the perspective of spatial archeology and the development of research limited to the formal description of rock motifs that does not explore the inherent chrono-cultural or interpretative issues. This problem in recent Cañarían archeology is a direct consequence of how the Cañarían scientific community deals with the study of rock art and when trying to unravel such questions as origin and meaning, the scenario remains unresolved. Currently, there are no research programs that provide for systematic survey and excavation. Nevertheless, we can affirm that the ancient colonization of the Canary Islands (Archaic Berber culture) was initiated by the sixth century BC in El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria. In a second stage, a Romanized Berber culture was introduced since the time of Augustus and Juba II (first century BC-1 century AD) to Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, El Hierro, and Tenerife.
