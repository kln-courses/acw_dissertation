<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE END OF UTOPIA? Leónidas Donskis 'Y'he twentieth century was supposed to have been the epoch of completely fulfilled utopias. The horrors of the past hundred or so years shed new light on the viability of Utopian thinking, and particularly on its dangers. In an age that has experienced totalitarianism, widespread violence, and subtle forms of modern slavery, Utopian ideals no longer compel or fascinate us. The critical assessment of utopianism in modern political phi- losophy has raised a number of doubts about the "warm" (to use Bloch's term) or humane basis of Utopian consciousness. Since history and culture are treated as phenomena founded on the assumption of free will, utopianism presents itself as a kind of social constructivism, a creation of counter-projects, and a rejec- tion of human freedom with its uniqueness and unpredictability. Anti-utopian (or dystopian) literature such as Zamyatin's We, Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984, and Burgess' A Clock- work Orange, assails societies based upon Utopian modes of think- ing (which are optimistic about the possibilities of engineering social and personal reality) just as it attacks the Utopian genre itself by adopting, and then subtly subverting, its conventions. Dystopias do fictionally what Popper, Hayek, Oakeshott, Dahrendorf, and other liberal thinkers do philosophically. The Russian philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev, living in exile af- ter the Bolsheviks took over his homeland, considered utopias to be all too likely to be viable, and our century has certainly shown this to be the case. He believed that it was incumbent upon intel- lectuals to protect humanity from any further Utopian societies. Berdyaev's thoughts on this subject were to become the motto Leónidas Donskis is Chairman of the Department of Philosophy and Director of the Klaipeda University Center for the Comparative Study of Civilizations in Klaipeda, Lithuania.

Later, Lewis Mumford, whose early work, The Story of Utopias, was an enthusias- tic endorsement of Utopian thought, came to see utopias as po- tential nightmares that stood easily within human reach. Despite these warnings, there are signs today that utopianism is alive and well. The decline and fall of Communism, Fascism, and National Socialism can serve neither as an argument for, nor as an exemplification of, the alleged grand failure of utopianism. Instead of heralding the doom of Utopian consciousness, these events are rather signs of the mere failure of fundamental, sacral- ized ideologies.1 Utopian thinking continues to be used today as a vehicle for new and radical ideas, and the notion of a Utopian consciousness remains a topic of interest among both political philosophers and social scientists. For example, as Barbara Good- win has indicated, [t]he radical politics of the 1960s produced a new interest in Uto- pian thinking. On the academic level, many new commentaries on utopianism have been produced. . . . There are ecological utopias such as Callenbach's Ecotopia. Also a number of fictional utopias have emerged from the feminist movement, the best known being Le Guin's The Dispossessed (1974) and Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976). It is significant that feminist writers have used Uto- pian devices to express feminist ideals - for example, the ideals of conciliation and caring - which do not readily find acceptance in orthodox, "masculine" political theory. Feminists also believe that "the personal is the political," and so need the wider scope afforded by utopianism to express their conception of society fully. Such thinkers use the Utopian mode for reasons similar to those which caused More to invent it: because certain radical hypotheses and aspirations will be flatly rejected if stated in conventional form (since they threaten powerful interest groups), because fictions gain a wider audience than political polemics, and conversion is the goal, and finally because certain truths are most powerfully expressed symbolically or by illustration. These constitute the ad- vantages which Utopian thought has over conventional political theory, and the reasons for hoping that utopias will continue to be written.2 It is too early, then, to ring the death knell for utopias. Yearn- ing for "the good place" arises out of the experience of marginal- ization and seems to provide an alternative, holistic model of society. Oppressed minorities, or in some cases majorities, suffer- ing from the intolerances of dominant social groups who fear or abhor difference and variety, always want to substitute their own</page><page sequence="3">The End of Utopia? 199 uniqueness and exclusivity for the new order they propose, and of course they propose to affect the whole society. In the past this vision has been founded primarily on the principle of pars pro toto - "the part becomes the whole"; an exception becomes the norm; particularity transforms itself into universality.3 The experience of oppression and despair usually requires some kind of symbolic compensation. The new and extremely vulnerable nations of East-Central Europe, for example, appear to be determined by a kind of inadequacy of self-consciousness and collective identity, and as a result tend to look backward (though this is not exclusively the case) with an obvious messi- anic emphasis. The "Third Rome" of the Russian Slavophiles, for example, or the "Athens of the North" extolled by Lithuanian neo-Romantics (not least of whom is the French poet Oscar Milosz), both seem to be grounded in a fundamental denial of modern Western civilization and an emphasis on personal heri- tage. This was evident in the ideological disputes that took place between the anti-Western, anti-modern Russian Slavophiles and the Hegelian Zapadniks who were sympathetic to Western re- forms which trace their origin back to Peter the Great. The mes- sianism of both of these nations has common roots: a purist, ethnocentric ideology wary of modern, and particularly Western, conventions. The enormously influential comparative study of civilizations by the Russian pan-Slavist Nikolai Danilevsky, Russia and Europe (1869), not only anticipated a conception of culture which was elaborated in such works as Leo Frobenius's Ursprung der Afrikanischen Kulturen und Naturwissenschaftliche Kulturlehre (1898) and Paideuma (1921), and Oswald Spengler' s Der Untergang des Abendlandes (1918-1922), but conceived of an entirely separate Russian culture which would take the place of Western civiliza- tion after its inevitable collapse. Instead of using such terms as "culture" and "civilization," Danilevsky offered a new vocabulary and a new theory of cultural-historical types based on a cyclical approach to the study of history. Not willing to claim full respon- sibility for this perspective, he did acknowledge the considerable influence of Heinrich Ruckerťs Lehrbuch der Weltgeschichte im or- ganischer Darstellung ( 1 857) . In light of Danilevsky's historical analysis and model for the future, the case of modern Lithuania is very interesting. In the</page><page sequence="4">200 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis twentieth century, the Lithuanian vision of being the "Athens of the North" has peacefully co-existed with a moderate Utopian construction which features this small nation as the bridge be- tween East and West (the former has often been reduced merely to "Slavic civilization" or "Russia"). This conception of a synthesis of civilizations - East and West - has been elaborated and pro- moted by the Lithuanian philosopher Stasys Salkauskis, particu- larly in his essay "Sur les confins de deux mondes," but it has come under severe criticism by other Lithuanian philosophers, including Salkauskis's own disciple, Antanas Maceina. We can see in this newly-formed nation, then, a precise example of the ori- gins of contemporary utopianism that we have been discussing: one part of the culture (a marginal layer) takes on a nationalistic and messianic vision and presumes to speak on behalf of the whole society. In present-day Lithuania, a part is representing it- self as the whole - not through the whole, which would imply a certain diversity and multi-dimensionality, but instead of the whole. But there is another reason, methodological rather than ideo- logical, to take utopianism seriously. In an epoch dominated by methodological individualism, or nominalism, a perspective which seeks to discover real flesh and blood human beings in- volved in the causa sui project of producing attitudes and ideas which challenge the status quo, there has been a consequential loss of the concept of "society" as a subject for theoretical in- quiry. Karl Popper, for example, in his books The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945) and The Poverty ofHistoricism (1957), attacks ho- lism and methodological essentialism to such an extent that, in his estimation, the notion of a whole civilization is rendered ob- solete. Only in some current theories of sociology, where the problematical focus on civilization coincides with symbolic de- sign, is the civilizational perspective gaining much of a hearing.4 It goes without saying that utopianism as such is neither sci- ence nor theory, but the point here is to note a dispersion of the elements of Utopian thinking across the cultural realm, including the theoretical articulation of this-worldly phenomena. For now the emphasis should be placed on utopianism as a pure expres- sion of both holism and methodological essentialism. In the con- temporary world which has undoubtedly experienced fragmentation and particularization, utopianism may come into</page><page sequence="5">The End of Utopia? 201 existence as a call for the revival of relinquished human unity and solidarity, rather than as a means for establishing the one- dimensional social order and alleged uniformity exaggerated by many of its critics. At the same time, a contemporary utopianism may manifest itself as a call for overcoming human despair and hopelessness and offer strong promise for a reintegration of the individual into society. Like the ancient Greek god of the seas, Proteus, who could change his shape at will, utopianism could now appear as a new form of social criticism addressed to increas- ing human emancipation by critiquing the various challenges to such traditional values systems as socio-cultural heritage, hierar- chical organization, and other basic axionormative dimensions. In short, Utopian thinking may now serve as a means for redis- covering the past and providing new meaning or value to society as a whole. It could well become the voice of forgotten holistic ideals, as well as a reference point amidst the permanent tension between social harmony and conflict which is at the center of contemporary social-scientific and political philosophical thought. As an integral aspect of human awareness, utopianism may be- come a vehicle through which human individuals might express their most fundamental existential experiences and expectations. But the concept itself has its own internal tension. On the one hand, there is the call for progress as it has been interpreted in modern philosophical discourse. On the other hand, however, is a cool distrust of such a notion, discrediting both the myth of progress and the optimistic belief in an optimum future goal, something akin to Leibniz's harmonia predestinata. Such a dy- namic is, in my estimation, why utopianism survives its critics who proclaim its demise. Like the double-faced Roman god Janus, it prevails over those who care to see only one of its dual dimensions. Double-Faced Janus Tracing utopias inevitably requires making a sharp distinction between theoretical or scientific manifestations of Utopian con- sciousness, on the one hand, and the free play of artistic imagina- tion which is at the core of the so-called literary utopias, on the other. Utopianism as a unique method for reflecting on human experience and social reality belongs exclusively neither to the</page><page sequence="6">202 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskü realm of the imagination nor to that of reality. While it is not grounded in concrete history, it certainly may not be understood as a complete rejection of the historically and ontologically lim- ited world. A utopia should not be reduced merely to a pure al- ternative vision of historical reality (though many superficial critics have done just this), nor should its revolutionary or con- structivist aspects be emphasized exclusively, as many liberal, non-utopian thinkers have done in the past. "Utopianism is clearly not an ideology (despite the 'ism') because many differ- ent kinds of utopia, of the right and left, and outside these cate- gories, have been imagined. It is a unique method of reflecting on politics and society, which seeks the perfect, best, or happiest form of society, untrammelled by commitments to existing institutions."5 Ideologies, as Algis Mickunas has suggested, are pure expres- sions of the metaphysics of the will, usually tending to identify truth with a deliberate, conscious transformation of reality. As both a symbolic configuration and prescriptive discourse, an ide- ology manifests itself in a constructivist framework. Further, it is deeply grounded in the existing reality, a realm that most utopias would prefer to escape or revise. Thus ideologies emerge as a force constituting or upholding social reality, while utopias pres- ent themselves not as revolutionary or constructivist transforma- tions, but as careful, moderate corrections to the status quo. The Utopian world is therefore neither a purified heavenly reality nor a sanctified earthly one; it is a model, and hardly the fantastic, extremist phenomenon its contemporary critics have supposed it to be. Thomas More's Utopia, for example, had as its starting point the ideological framework of Reformation England, Jo- hann Valentin Andrea was inspired to write Christianopolis after a visit to Calvin's Geneva, and Francis Bacon's depiction of the is- land of Bensalem in his New Atlantis is very much an idealization of Jacobean England. Thus, utopias emerge as a dynamic and complex combination of reflections on an empirically existing reality and the anticipation of its as yet undiscovered agreeable aspects. Another difference between ideologies and utopias is that the former find their mission in the historical world by providing the axionormative framework for human creation and interaction, whereas the latter prefer to approach this framework from a criti-</page><page sequence="7">The End of Utopia? 203 cal perspective. Ideologies endeavor to make history per se, and create a sense of history, while utopias usually reveal their quin- tessence in parody and satire, casting doubt on the alleged order of history. The objective of Utopian thinking, then, is to be deconstructive as opposed to constructive. It is little wonder that such a perspective forms the basis for a variety of social and cul- tural criticisms, from William Blake's Golgonooza which appeared as the antithesis to the cities of the Industrial Revolution, to Lewis Mumforďs vision of a new American culture in Herman Melville, a society opposed to the technological civilization of the twentieth century. As Gary Saul Morson has suggested, one form of the Utopian consciousness existed early on as a kind of "anti-genre" in the non-conventional and subversive narratives of Western history, long before the "classical," or paradigmatic, Utopian texts ap- peared. One is reminded, for instance, of the ancient Greek anti-tragedies or the medieval parodist grammars and liturgies. Morson suggests that utopianism may in fact have had its genesis in this early subversive literature, and this analysis may be helpful in providing new criteria for evaluating the masterpieces of such literary figures as François Rabelais, Jonathan Swift, and Daniel Defoe. It may also shed new light on the genre of contemporary science fiction and its apparent Utopian origin. Thus, when ana- lyzing the origins of utopianism, the problem of historical narra- tive should not be reduced merely to historiography. Rather, the historical imagination needs to be taken into consideration, and therefore meta-history itself, rather than the discipline of history as it is traditionally studied. Both utopias and anti-utopias (which many have claimed Swift's Gulliver's Travels and Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel to be) have essentially the same roots. Their commonality lies in the principle of non-acceptance of any monolithic reality and in the fact that they both seek to offer an alternative. But at the same time we should distinguish between these two literary genres. Whereas utopia is always holding the principles of reality and imagination in creative tension, anti-utopian thought is dom- inated primarily by the former. Anti-utopianism, as an "anti- genre," nearly always has a target text, as when, for example, Sa- muel Butler responds to More's Utopia with Erewhon, an anagram for "nowhere," or when Aldous Huxley's Brave New World serves</page><page sequence="8">204 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis as a reply to H.G. Wells's The Time Machine. It is therefore both a textual and an intertextual phenomenon, emerging as a warning against the anticipation of far-reaching discoveries offered by utopias.6 Anti-utopianism is wary of Utopian faith in human rea- son preferring to place its emphasis on its more obvious limita- tions, and serving as a reminder of the need to care about a very fragile human reality. One final difference between these two phenomena is the role and place of the narrator. Critics who see utopias as destructive rationalist constructions or violent, monstrous forces threatening human existence are obviously lacking in intellectual responsibil- ity, and this for two reasons. First, it is necessary to distinguish between a local, or localizing, utopia and a global, or globalizing, one. Modest Utopian communities based on small-scale experi- mentation cannot be held responsible for global political processes and their horrible consequences. Second, references to totalitarianism and its manifestations in National Socialism, Fascism, and Communism are á weak basis for a theoretical counter-argument against utopianism. It is too complex a phe- nomenon, both historically and ideologically, to be reduced to an alleged product of some Utopian frame of reference. As Hannah Arendt has shown, totalitarianism has emerged as a new, specifically modern form of government which should not be confused with earlier and more traditional forms of oppression.7 Besides, the Utopian origin of totalitarianism must be proved and not simply declared: the confusion of utopianism and ideology does not make for a very persuasive argument. Is Utopianism the Evil Phenomenon? At this point several questions present themselves. In light of the often "closed" and contrived nature of Utopian society, can- not utopianism be considered a particular instance of totalitarian thought? Further, does a basic similarity exist between utopian- ism and totalitarianism as a matter of fact? Utopian social structure, politics, and government have been severely criticized by a number of modern thinkers, including Popper, Hayek, Oakeshott, and Talmon. Popper, for example, has exposed the "social engineering" which threatens human spontaneity lurking just below the surface of the Utopian frame- work. Hayek has also challenged Utopian "constructivist rational-</page><page sequence="9">The End of Utopia? 205 ism," which similarly hinders the natural development of human society, while Oakeshott maintains that the very basis of any com- munity is the accretion of traditions, not rational reconstruction or revolution. But it appears that each of these critics is confus- ing utopianism with what Louis Dumont has called "national vari- ants of the modern ideology," and each has also managed to conflate Utopian texts and totalitarian practices. In light of this, Goodwin's critical assessment is helpful: The Utopian mode of thinking can be defended in various ways against these critics: for example, by showing that the rationalist approach and commitment to a single truth has virtues which the empiricist, piecemeal, "open," laissez-faire approach advocated by Popper and others lacks. It can also be shown that anti-totalitarian and anti-utopian thinkers deceive themselves in their presentation of liberal-democratic society as paradigmatically open. Most tell- ing, perhaps, against Popper's tirade is the fact that most Utopian thinkers have not proposed to enforce their schemes by revolution or coercion: education, small-scale experiment, or even demo- cratic choice have been most favoured as the routes to utopia.8 Although the critical assessment of the utopia-free political philosophers of our time seems to be quite convincing, a few im- portant problems need to be discussed more explicitly. In cur- rent Anglo-American political philosophy, utopianism is more or less identified with rationalism, and even more explicitly with perfectionism. Take, for example, the assessment of Oakeshott: The evanescence of imperfection may be said to the first item of the creed of the Rationalist. He is not devoid of humility; he can imagine a problem which would remain impervious to the on- slaught of his own reason. But what he cannot imagine is politics which do not consist in solving problems, or a political problem of which there is no "rational" solution at all. Such a problem must be counterfeit. And the "rational" solution of any problem is, in its nature, the perfect solution. There is no place in his scheme for a "best in the circumstances," only a place for "the best"; because the function of reason is precisely to surmount circumstances. Of course, the Rationalist is not always a perfectionist in general, his mind governed in each occasion by a comprehensive Utopia, but invariably he is a perfectionist in detail. And from this politics of perfection springs the politics of uniformity; a scheme which does not recog- nize circumstance can have no place for variety (my emphasis).9 Oakeshott's anti-utopian argument corresponds with that of Popper, especially with regard to the latter's critique of social en- gineering in The Open Society and Its Enemies. Popper makes a</page><page sequence="10">206 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis sharp distinction between the sinister Utopian engineering and what he describes metaphorically as piecemeal engineering. He also argues that "canvas-cleaning," aestheticism, radicalism, and Ro- manticism lie at the very heart of utopianism itself. Aestheticism and radicalism must lead us to jettison reason, and to replace it by a desperate hope for political miracles. This irrational attitude which springs from an intoxication with dreams of a beau- tiful world is what I call Romanticism. . . .It may seek its heavenly city in the past or in the future; it may preach "back to nature" or "forward to a world of love and beauty"; but its appeal is always to our emotions rather than to reason. Even with the best intentions of making heaven on earth it only succeeds in making it a hell - that hell which man alone prepares for his fellow-men.10 Popper's overgeneralizations about Plato's sociological diagno- sis and the origins of utopianism culminate in the following passage: Arresting political change is not the remedy; it cannot bring hap- piness. We can never turn to the alleged innocence and beauty of the closed society. . . .Our dream of heaven cannot be realized on earth. Once we begin to rely upon our reason, and to use our pow- ers of criticism, once we feel the call of personal responsibilities, and with it, the responsibility of helping to advance knowledge, we cannot return to a state of implicit submission to tribal magic. For those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge, paradise is lost. The more we try to return to the heroic age of tribalism, the more surely do we arrive at the Inquisition, at the Secret Police, and at a romanticized gangsterism. Beginning with the suppression of rea- son and truth, we must end with the most brutal and violent de- struction of all that is human. . . .There is no return to a harmonious state of nature. If we turn back, then we must go the whole way - we must return to the beasts}1 Jacob Leib Talmon takes a similar view. In his critique utopian- ism is conceived as "political messianism at the Romantic phase." We detect the influence of Popper when Talmon speaks of ". . .those fantastic psychological constructions and technical con- trivances, as well as paradisal images with which. . . Utopias abound" (my emphasis).12 And we can hear Oakeshott echoed in Talmon's critique of Utopian striving for "a coherent, complete, and final solution [to] the problem of social evil."13 Friedrich Hayek's critical analysis of democratic socialism, con- ceived as a contradictio in adjecto (and thus as nothing else but the Great Utopia), inevitably leads to far-reaching conclusions. Ac- cording to Hayek, utopia/socialism (or "collectivism") has in</page><page sequence="11">The End of Utopia! 207 principle nothing to do with freedom since it tends to eclipse the primacy of the individual. Hayek suggests that Nietzschean-Spen- glerian will-to-power lies at the heart of all socialistic constructs, though it is given the guise of a collective freedom. There can be no doubt that the promise of greater freedom has become one of the most effective weapons of socialistic propa- ganda and that the belief that socialism would bring freedom is genuine and sincere. But this would only heighten the tragedy if it should prove that what was promised to us as the Road to Freedom was in fact the High Road to Servitude. Unquestionably, the prom- ise of more freedom was responsible for luring more and more liberals along the socialist road, for blinding them to the conflict which exists between the basic principles of socialism and liber- alism, and for often enabling socialists to usurp the very intelli- gentsia as the apparent heir of the liberal tradition: therefore it is not surprising that to them the idea of socialism's leading to the opposite of liberty should appear inconceivable.14 What is really surprising here is the obvious coincidence of Spengler's and Hayek's notions of socialism. In his Preussentum und Sozialismus, Spengler defines socialism as nothing more than the complete fulfillment of the will-to-power; anything else con- cerning the essence of this political philosophy, according to Spengler, is merely ideological lip-service. How should we assess this apparently incomprehensible coincidentia oppositorum? Why do Hayek and Spengler, so funda- mentally incompatible with regard to most other matters, share exactly the same argument when defining the nucleus of socialism? One hypothesis might be that both a radically historicist and fatalistic approach, as represented by Spengler, and a radically anti-historicist, anti-utopian, and piecemeal approach, as main- tained by Hayek (and most of the anti-utopian thinkers), coin- cide in their common rejection of the principle of imagination. This is not to say that socialism represents the principle of imagi- nation; on the contrary, it is more than anything else based on the so-called Realpolitik. Both of these approaches move beyond paradigmatic utopianism and therefore have little, if anything, to say about it. A radically anti-utopian approach usually culminates with the argument that utopianism will sooner or later amount to totali- tarianism. Utopia, the reasoning goes, equals the idea of a total</page><page sequence="12">208 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis society. One of the brightest expressions of this argument is found in Ralf Dahrendorf 's Reflections on the Revolution in Europe, in which the author's critique approximates those of Hayek and Popper in the uncompromising struggle against the Utopian mode of thought. In Dahrendorf 's estimation, [w]e must beware of Utopia. . . and not only if it is of the Rous- seauean variety. Utopia is in the nature of the idea a total society. It may exist "nowhere," but it is held up as a counterproject to the realities of the world in which we are living. Utopia is a complete alternative, and therefore of necessity a complete society. Why did I not write the planned anti-Orwell book, Nineteen Eighty-nine Be- cause I could not find a way out of Big Brother's Nineteen Eighty- four for Winston Smith. Benevolent Utopias are no better. Karl Popper's demolition of Plato's Republic has precisely this theme. Whoever sets out to implement Utopian plans will in the first in- stance have to wipe clean the canvas on which the real world is painted. This is a brutal process of destruction. Second, a new world will have to be constructed which is bound to lead to errors and failures, and will in any case require awkward transitional peri- ods like the "dictatorship of the proletariat." The probability must be high that in the end we will be stuck with the transition; dicta- tors are not in the habit of giving up their power.15 The basic argument is as follows: the real goal of utopia is es- tablishment of a non-conflictual society instead of a happy or free one. Utopian thinkers and writers have associated the per- fectibility of society with the elimination of social conflict rather than with the guarantee of human rights and the self-fulfillment of the individual. To reduce this argument ad absurdum, the ideal social model for a Utopian thinker would be a cemetery. More, Andrea, and Campanella seem not to have been too concerned with the happiness of their utopias. Campanella's City of the Sun with its tendencies toward total uniformity and unifica- tion of all members, or More's Utopia with its split between men/ women of manual work and their Syphogrants, or Andrea's Chris- tianopolis where human passion is a disgrace and there is no clear distinction between the religious and the secular spheres, can hardly be regarded as places in which humans are happy and free. Galileo's proclaimed principle of mathesis universali, a way of mathematizing and divinizing the human world and of providing a symbolic means by which humans can participate in the realm of perfectibility, may offer some key insights into the problem</page><page sequence="13">The End of Utopia? 209 thus presented. The idea of perfectibility in the classical Utopian texts has never been upheld as a possibility for humans as indi- viduals. Rather, it has usually been treated as a quality that ac- crues to the earthly order when it adequately reflects the heavenly realm (Plato's Republic), or as the conformity of the em- pirical sphere, which includes humans, with the mathematical- symbolic one. The supreme order derived from the perfectibility of mathesis universalis may be found in the very nucleus of the Utopian Order, and this is essentially based on the epistemic, aes- thetic, and even moral ideals of the Renaissance. Andrea enters Christianopolis after the shipwreck of his vessel, Fantasy, and there finds a zoned city where the ordered life of its 400 inhabitants is reflected in the geometry and symmetry of its layout. Similarly, Campanella's Austrinopolis is built on a pattern of concentric circles ("It is divided into seven large rings or cir- cles named after the seven planets, and each is connected to the next by four streets passing through four gates facing the four points of the compass"16). A society based upon such models of mathematical, cosmological, and metaphysical perfectibility is de- termined to be conflict-free, for conflict is chaos and disorder. This kind of logic is no doubt what Popper has in mind when he derides "utopian engineering," or when Dahrendorf articulates his "counterproject." Another locus minoris of Utopian thought lies in the emphasis it places on social harmony, which is often and superficially con- trasted to social conflict. Utopia usually tends to offer an exciting invitation to withdraw from Gesellschaft to Gemeinschaft, to retire from the confines of urban, mechanical diversity to rural, or- ganic, idyllic unity. In contrast to anti-natural disorder, utopias offer natural order, harmony in the midst of conflict. This kind of historical or civilizational retrogression can be found in such works as Rousseau's two Discourses and William Morris's News from Nowhere, where the essential Utopian belief in the lost earthly par- adise is a secular one. Without the Renaissance idea of "the city of man" (Christo- pher Tunnard's term for the fundamental change that took place in the history of the city), the above sequence of Utopian cities would be incomprehensible. Andrea's Christianopolis or Campanella's Austrinopolis only reflect - with some elements of theoretical articulation and additional social analysis - the</page><page sequence="14">210 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis idea of Leonardo's perfectible earthly city of beauty, clarity, and order, or Antonio Filarete's Sforzinda, the earthly manifestation of the heavenly sphere. Harvey Cox's The Secular City provided an extensive explana- tion of the new civilizational conditions under which modern, or paradigmatic, utopianism has been able to emerge.17 Technopolis, which refers to the secularizing civilization of the West which be- gan to emerge during the Renaissance, is representative of an era of discovery. The secularization of the modern world has been accompanied not only by the discovery of the world and of hu- manity (what Lewis Mumford refers to as "the era of expan- sion"18), but also by the very nucleus of modernity: openness and universalism in the value system, and an emphasis on human self- fulfillment. This is indeed the era which heard Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola proclaim that "man can make of himself whatever he likes." But I doubt whether or not utopianism is itself responsible for the excesses that its critics deride. Much less is utopianism re- sponsible for the rationalist predictions and justifications of totalitarianism. Ideology and Utopia In Ideology and Utopia (1929), Karl Mannheim described Uto- pian ideas as altogether "incongruent with reality," which if trans- lated into action would inevitably overthrow the existing social order. By contrast, he described ideology as a totality of ideas, also incongruent with reality, which nevertheless tends to justify and maintain the status quo. It is conceivable, then, that Utopian ideas could be regarded as ideological, but only after they have been realized in the social sphere. According to Mannheim, this has happened in a number of contexts, from liberal to Marxist. Mannheim regretted what he understood to be the absence of the "utopian mentality" in modern society, particularly in liberal democracy. For Mannheim, utopianism is not limited merely to politics but extends far beyond the political sphere and can be found in liter- ature, art, social philosophy, and history - within the realms of both the sciences and the humanities. It is the anticipation of an as yet non-existing space and of an as yet non-existing time. How, for example, would it be possible to explain the nature of the</page><page sequence="15">The End of Utopia? 211 scientific hypothesis without some recourse to an anticipation of some hitherto concealed reality? Utopian consciousness is noth- ing less than a self-projecting consciousness which includes the self- fulfilling and self-justifying objectives of the modern technologi- cal paradigm. It emerges as an effort to create the inner, hidden reality which parallels the existing one. At the same time, this type of consciousness, when directed toward social reality, may emerge as a corrective - not destruc- tive - measure for the status quo. It may serve as a foundation for both artistic creation and intellectual transformation of real- ity in general. Political utopianism as invented and elaborated in the Renaissance is but one aspect of a much larger perspective, what one might call "applied" or "practical" utopianism. It is a part and not the whole of Utopian thought. The confusion of ideology and utopianism has several sources. For the Marxists and the positivista, ideology is met with great suspicion, either as a means for creating a "false consciousness" or "turning the world upside down," or as a para-theory lacking strict criteria of verification. Thus these two schools of thought continue to interpret the concept of ideology in a negative sense, always placing the term in a pejorative context. Karl Popper, a former logical empiricist, has "subtracted" all holistic, essential phenomena - metaphysics, ideologies, and utopianism - from the realm of scientifically verifiable truth. But one wonders how and by what conceptual framework Popper was able to construct his well-known concept of "the third world" as the realm of ideas without any appeal whatsoever to the ideational. And how is it possible to construct a theory of history based on methodological individualism or nominalism? The idea of utopia comes into existence within a certain histor- ical-cultural context but only by means of a much more global ideology. Without this latter set of social representations, ideas, and values - all of which have prescriptive implications for poli- tics - utopia means nothing. What one is left with is merely ele- ments of consciousness dispersed among diverse cultural locations. Without ideology, utopianism becomes little more than the free play of imagination devoid of cultural - aesthetic, moral, and intellectual - articulation. Today it is commonly accepted that "ideology" cannot be ex- plored in clear and neutral terms. It has been left outside the</page><page sequence="16">212 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis realm of analytical discourse, no longer an appropriate subject for legitimate scientific research. But Louis Dumont has offered a clear definition of ideology, and one that appears to meet all the criteria of objectivity: I define ideology as the totality of ideas and values - or "represen- tations" - common to a society or current in a given social group. . . .It is probably expected. . . that I should distinguish more or less substantially between ideology, on the one hand, and science, or rationality, or truth, or philosophy, on the other. To make such a distinction is the last thing I would do. The only aspect common to the present view and a widespread, more or less Marxist, usage is the social relativity: any ideology is a social set of representations - certainly a very complex affair. The fact that one particular repre- sentation in that set is judged as true or false, rational or tradi- tional, scientific or not, is irrelevant to the social nature of the idea or value. For example: that the earth revolves around the sun is, I take it, a scientific statement, but it is admitted by most of our contemporaries without their being able to demonstrate it. More- over, even for those who are able to do so, this statement is part of their world view, together with many other statements they cannot demonstrate. As such, it may legitimately be taken as an integral part of the ideology as a whole, that is, as entertaining certain rela- tions with other components of it.19 Why has Western thought offered simplistic answers to so many fundamental questions, and why are these so readily lauded as viable means for solving the basic problems of human existence? In my estimation, postmodern thought which pro- claims itself as ideology-free does not take critically its own condi- tio sine qua non. Judging themselves to have "arrived," philosophers and scientists appear to have no need for further discoveries about the world and humanity, and with this attitude has come the collapse of the great historical narrative of the West. Utopia as the Discovery of Civilizations Utopianism is most deeply concerned with two fundamental ontological dimensions - space and time. As such it reflects the most basic categories of the Judeo-Christian ontology and worldview. For this reason, as Jeffrey A. Shad, Jr. notes, it is diffi- cult to find similar ontological constituents of Utopian conscious- ness in non-Western civilizations.</page><page sequence="17">The End of Utopia! 213 That Islam rejects the Western ideology of progress is affirmed by Seyyed Hossein Nasr. . . [who] notes that there is no word for uto- pia in Arabic or Persian because Muslims believe that paradise ex- ists only in heaven. This is reflected in the Islamic conception of time which, according to Nasr, is not linear, as in the West, but "based essentially on the cyclic rejuvenation of human history through the appearance of various prophets and ending finally in the eschatological events identified with the appearance of the Mahdi" "This," says Nasr, "reestablishes harmony and peace in the world through direct divine intervention and not through the secular changes brought about by means of mere human agency "2ď Utopianism as secularized consciousness substitutes an earthly paradise for the heavenly one, and it reflects the modern con- cept of time much more than any perpetual search for happi- ness. There is a tendency toward a civilizational or cross-cultural universalization of utopianism. In China and the Search for Happi- ness, Wolfgang Bauer writes: The shock created in China by its clash with Western world views which, in spite of their many differences, were almost wholly ori- ented toward the future, was all the greater. The explosive force, the dynamic power that quite obviously inhered in these views and revealed itself massively in the technological and military superior- ity of the West, left China no choice. It had to adapt itself to the new insight that the future belongs to those who made it the goal of all their endeavor. The question remains, however, whether China thereby really adopted the western concept of time and his- torical movement, or whether past and future did not merely change places without modifying the system of thought in any way. For both past and future and consequently the concept of movement and history have an entirely different meaning here than in western systems (my emphasis).21 Bauer seems also to be concerned with perceived differences between China and Russia, whose history has been marked by the presence of messianic ideas.22 This raises a compelling question: is the cross-cultural comparison of China and the classical mod- els of western thought the only legitimate approach to a study of this nature, or might one benefit from contrasting China with more peripheral, "parochial" models such as that offered by Rus- sia, or any other East-Central European country where these mes- sianic ideas are still prevalent? Bauer's generalizing scheme and research strategy may be both theoretically profound and correct, but the question re-</page><page sequence="18">214 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis mains whether the concept of utopia in the sense of the paradig- matic Western philosophy of history is so easily applicable to China and the search for happiness. It is not clear whether China ever really adopted the Western notion of progress toward per- fectibility, either of the individual or of society. Eliade's distinction between "archaic" and "modern" notions of time may be instructive here.23 The former, he suggests, is re- petitive, cyclical, non-linear, and, consequently, non-progressive; it is based on the idea of multiple, cyclical redemptions of the cosmos, as any study of the archaic religions of the world might reveal. By contrast, modern time is based on the idea that a once- for-all redemption will occur only at the end of history itself. Modern time is the model or paradigm on which Utopian think- ing in the West has been constructed. Eliade also points out that Christian eschatology and the no- tion of original sin have been extremely influential in the elabo- ration of the modern conception of time. We can hardly avoid reference here to St. Augustine's theology. Augustine's concepts of original sin and redemption, or of the last judgment, have served as the paradigm by which Westerners speak of the begin- ning and the end of human history. In the context of the history of ideas, De civitate Dei can be regarded as a sign of both the fu- ture emancipation of anthropomorphic time and a concept of modern time articulated theoretically. This is why Thomas More's attachment to St. Augustine is not accidental. But I am not as enthusiastic a supporter of the pro- fundity of this connection as the historian Charles Trinkaus, who writes: More's attachment to St. Augustine is well known, but as Father Surtz declared in his introductory section to the Yale translation of Utopia, the exact connection of Utopia with De civitate Dá remains to be worked out. . . . Humanists such as Valla and Erasmus did not hesitate to polemicize with many of Augustine's positions. But it should never be forgotten that what were perhaps the pivotal issues of both the Renaissance and the Reformation had found their monumental exposition in the De civitate Dá, namely whether the world of man could be truly Christian and how much could mankind save itself from its own impulses to self-destruction apart from grace. Moreover, Book 19 of the De civitate Dá set the terms for the discussion of the great Erasmian-Morean problem of find- ing peace in a world where there was no peace. There were some who would have argued, not long ago, that to see the Church fa-</page><page sequence="19">The End of Utopia? 215 thers as central to the thinking of the Renaissance was a contradic- tion in terms. But I cannot think that it is so anymore. Rather, the Church fathers provided the frame within which Renaissance humanists in great preponderance viewed the antique past, explored the great pa- gan works in a new objectivity and depth, and were able to criticize them for their inappropriateness while admiring their historical actuality (emphasis added).24 The Utopian thought of the Renaissance did fictionally and non-conventionally what the Western philosophy of history had done theoretically since St. Augustine's De civitate Dei. Both the Church fathers and the Renaissance humanists had found the specific human reality to be quite different from both the natural and supernatural world. It is surprising that interpreters like Popper (for whom Plato, Hegel, and Marx represent essentially the same mode of think- ing) uncritically draw such strong connections between the Re- public and modern utopianism. Plato's description of the decline of the ancient Greek polis, or of the Persian Empire, for example, is carried out within a paradigm dominated by the idea of the life-cycle and deeply grounded in the concept of archaic time. But for some reason Popper chooses to include Plato's approach within the ideological vision of modern history, the so-called morphological concept of "life-cycle" elaborated by such thinkers as Vico, Spengler, and Toynbee. Further, for Plato, human reality only reflects a celestial perfection. The characteristics of human interaction in the Republic reinforce the cosmological argument for symmetry, proportion, and order.25 Commenting on More's interpretation of Plato, Trinkaus sug- gests that though . . .More's use of the Republic in Utopia was idiosyncratic and. . . his position was different from Plato's,. . . the central question in both works was whether there can be any justice in our private dealings unless there is first justice in the structure of society as a whole. And if we come now to Plato's own views of justice there is the most fundamental disagreement between Plato and More: justice clearly meaning equality for More (whether disguised as himself or as "Hythloday"), whereas Plato's definition for it was proportion. Moreover, another problem that deeply concerned More through- out his entire life was critical for Plato/Socrates as well: a concern basic to our notion of humanism, that of the role of the morally wise man in the affairs of the public and as a ruler of the state.2</page><page sequence="20">216 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis Clearly, Popper's allusion to the contrary, Plato is not a Utopian in the modern sense of the term. Rather, Plato's cosmos is more sug- gestive of the Laplacian demon who can predict all future events because it knows the speed and direction of all bodies in the uni- verse. And far from being the first Utopian thinker, Plato is actu- ally the first failure as a social constructivist, as his social and political frustrations at Syracuse attest. More's notion that justice is founded in equality is key to un- derstanding the origins of the idea of utopia. Individualism and equality emerge as both complementary phenomena (a dimen- sion of social reality) and complementary concepts (a dimension of modern discourse); they are hardly able to be understood if taken in isolation from each other. The Renaissance as the epoch of the great geographical discov- eries and expansions inevitably led to the invention of the new discourse anticipating and constituting the dialogue, or even "polylogue," of civilizations. The voyages of Cabot, Vasco de Gama, Vespucci, and others transformed people's image of the world with knowledge and fantastic stories of lands and cultures whose existence had never even been suspected. Utopianism as the phenomenon of satirical narrative would hardly be distin- guishable from all the satirical literature that flourished during the humanist movement. Utopianism emerged as the first culturally legitimized and con- ventionally accepted form of social criticism. The most appropri- ate way for Utopian writers to live safely and avoid serious misunderstandings was to employ a fictional trick. It amounted to a fundamental change in the historical imagination, introduc- ing the apparently naive or simple-minded narrator who finds almost everything under the heavens surprising, wonderful, and amazing. In More's Utopia, for example, the storyteller is called Raphael Hythlodae, "dispenser of nonsense"; in Christianopolis, Andrea himself is required by three magistrates to take an en- trance examination, after which he is allowed to enter the city, not because of his excellent performance on the test, but as a result of his cleansing ordeal by shipwreck. In Bacon's New Atlan- tis we find a description of Bensalem supposedly discovered by Bacon and his friends after they had been lost at sea. Similarly, Swift's shipwrecked Gulliver finds a confusing incongruence be- tween the mysteries and realities of the world he has just discov-</page><page sequence="21">The End of Utopia? 217 ered, on the one hand, and his own modest, unsophisticated knowledge and experience, on the other. The modesty and naivete of the storyteller was by no means accidental. From Bensalem, Amanóte, Austrinopolis, and Chris- tianopolis, the Utopian storyteller, or upholder of the historical imagination, brought a comparative perspective to the Old World. This had far-reaching consequences. First, it enriched the historical imagination of Renaissance discourse by offering an al- ternative vision of the Old World, challenging whether it was in- deed the only true civilization, or the best world. Second, it offered a new, subversive, but nevertheless culturally legitimized form of social criticism. The phenomenon of the voyage is such an effective allegorical reference to the liberation of conscious- ness, individual or collective. On the other hand, retrospective or backward-looking utopias often manifest themselves as pure expressions of a culture in cri- sis. A deliberate restoration of the past can be a significant warn- ing that a set of social representations of the present, including a totality of ideas and values, has come to mean nothing in the present. Utopian consciousness witnesses the crisis of modern ideology as the image of the shipwrecked Utopian storyteller. Conclusion Utopianism is neither the historic failure of Western rationality nor, metaphorically speaking, the road to hell allegedly built on good intentions. Nor is it to be confused with the traditions of chiliasm and millenarianism. These are all oversimplifications. To speak in medias res, utopianism is a phenomenon - and a consequence - of the historical process of the "autonomization" of Western consciousness. It is hardly comprehensible without reference to the dominant ideology of its particular historical ep- och. It comes into existence as a reaction to ideology, for ideolo- gies inevitably require that they be either affirmed or rejected, and the Utopian consciousness is quick to meet this expectation. But the connection between ideology and utopianism is double- sided: utopianism can maintain the status quo but, on the other side, it can deny it radically. So utopianism emerges as a mirror - true or subversive - of ideology, and, simultaneously, subli- mates, or even humanizes, it in cultural forms. Utopian con-</page><page sequence="22">218 SOUNDINGS Leónidas Donskis sciousness is the locus at which the various ideas and values of a culture are tested, and where their consequences are considered. Without the analytical tools provided by the modern philoso- phy of history, utopianism would remain an amorphous term eas- ily reducible to and lost among various fictional stories or daily experiences of generous visionaries. But utopianism emerges as a passionate questioning, even rejection, of the present in favor of tomorrow or yesterday; it is not the alleged and ever-present search for social justice and happiness it is reputed to be. Ulti- mately, utopianism functions to maintain the modern idea that everything in this world suggests some latent alternative. NOTES 1. Paul Ricouer has made invaluable contributions to the study of both ideol- ogy and utopia, suggesting that the two are in fact complementary phenom- ena of the cultural imagination. See, for example, his "Ideology and Utopia as Cultural Imagination," in Being Human in a Technological Age, ed. Donald M. Borchert and David Stewart (Athens, OH: Ohio UP, 1982), and Lectures on Ideology and Utopia, ed. George H. Taylor (New York: Columbia UP, 1986). 2.

In the words of Philip Bagby, it would be a destructive subculture tending to destroy all ties with the dominant culture, and even become a substitute for it. Thus, the aggressive, destructive, and, in many cases, marginal subculture may even reach the third hierarchical step within a culture configuration, what Bagby refers to as a superculture. This logic of the socio-cultural self- fulfillment based on the substitution or even deliberate confusion of basic concepts helps us to explain the dynamics of "proletarian culture" (in the Marxian conceptual frame) and "feminine culture" (in the feminist con- ceptual frame). It is a case of pure pars pro toto stressed by an essential mar- ginal experience of these movements. 4. bee Vytautas Kavolis, "(Jivilizational Faradigms in Current sociology: uu- mont vs. Eisenstadt," in Current Perspectives in Social Theory, vol. 7 (1986): 125-40. 5.

The latter tend to take seriously a very cynical, anti-human ideology, or some form of modern social mythol- ogy, by which to justify and affirm perverse forms of human self-expression and interaction. By contrast, the former endeavor always to liberate society from dangerous prejudices and naive beliefs by discrediting not their ideo- logical basis but their textual foundations. Anti-utopias seek out text- targets. Examples of dystopias, which seem to be exclusively twentieth-cen- tury phenomena, include Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, George Orwell's 1984, and Zamyatin's We.</page><page sequence="23">The End of Utopia? 219 7.
