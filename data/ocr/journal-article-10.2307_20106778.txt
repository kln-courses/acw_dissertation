<plain_text><page sequence="1">Five heads and no tale: Hanuman and the popularization of Tantra Philip Lutgendorf PANCAMUKH? HANUM?N Anyone having even a superficial acquaintance with Hinduism and with the R?m?yana story will generally be able to recognize Hanum?n, R?ma's beloved monkey-servant, as the diminutive, fur-covered figure kneeling in adoration at R?ma's feet in the popular posters that celebrate R?ma's enthronement as king of Ayodhy? following his defeat of the evil R?vana and recovery of his beloved Sit?. In Valm?ki's Sanskrit epic, composed possibly in the fourth century BCE, Hanum?n easily emerges (to use a cinematic metaphor) as Best Supporting Actor, at least among the nonhuman characters, but his worship as a deity in his own right does not become well documented until the ninth or tenth centuries of the Common Era. Elsewhere I have discussed the probable circumstances behind the spread of his worship as well as the fact of his marginalization in modem academic scholarship (Lutgendorf 1994: 217-34). Most scholars consider him (if they discuss him at all) a straightforward but minor figure in the teeming Hindu pantheon, a vegetarian Vaisnava deity who embodies both power and devotion and whose worship is (according to one authority) *a relatively late and marginal phenomenon within Vaisnavism' (Bakker 1986: I26n). Yet, as I have also noted, his ubiquitous presence, especially in the contemporary urban temple-scape and in poster art, suggests that he plays a far more important role in popular religion. Understanding this role requires serious examination of the manifestations of popular religious culture, including ritual practices, temples and shrines, mass-printed vernacular literature, and 'visual texts' such as the colorful 'god posters' that have proliferated during the past century to become possibly the most ubiquitous of Indian consumer products.

Inquiring of a knowledgeable devotee as to what a given poster represents will generally yield one or more stories because every picture is, so to speak, a little polychrome pur?na that encodes an often complex narrative.1 Except when it does not: Encountering one particular, and particularly recurrent, image during my visits to temples, b?z?rs, and private homes, I asked devotees what it represented and mostly drew a blank. Everyone could identify it easily enough ?the 'five-faced Hanum?n' (Pa?camukh? Hanum?n)?yet almost none could provide a story to contextualize it or even an explanation of its striking features: five different heads and ten arms, each bearing a different weapon or ritual object. This was all the more puzzling as the image seemed to be appearing increasingly. A variety of posters representing it could generally be obtained from even a modest-sized god-poster display, some with bulging, highly defined musculature suggestive of bodybuilders or the buff heroes of post-1980s 'Bollywood' films.2 Moreover, gleaming sind?ra-covered stone images of this Hanum?n were receiving worship in the sancta of freshly built shrines in Ayodhya, Chitrakut, Hardwar, and Jaipur. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, several senior R?m?yana scholars told me that the image, rarely seen in their youths, had now become commonplace.3 Clearly it was, in some sense, 'popular,' yet it seemed to exist beyond the confines of the familiar R?m?yana narrative and to be in fact without a 'biography,' without a text.4 Or perhaps the ?mage was its own text, a self-contained theological essay?but communicating what? The most common responses that interviewees gave me were simply to the effect that it is t?ntrika' or it has a lot of power (par?krama, sakti). My interest was piqued, and I inquired further. I discovered, in time, that although this Hanum?n lacks a tale, he has a history and even a text. Tantra is an elusive term that covers an extremely broad range of beliefs, practices, and texts.5 Perhaps rooted in archaic techniques for the attainment of altered states of consciousness, it also shows the influence of the Vedic sacrificial religion, especially of the magical spells and rites prescribed in Atharva Veda (ca. 900 BCE). It emphasizes self-empowerment and self identification with a deity, achieved through experimental techniques that depend largely on individual volition rather than on the devotional self-surrender or divine grace associated with certain bhakti orientations. During the first millennium of the Common Era, Tantric traditions developed within most of the indigenous religions of South Asia. Although early Tantric practices may have been associated with the self-expression of nonelite communities, such practices were readily appropriated by Br?hmanas and other high-status groups and even came, at various periods, to enjoy a vogue in courtly circles.</page><page sequence="4">272 / Philip Lutgendorf In addition, there developed a flourishing popular lore about Tantra and its practitioners. Since Tantra is understood to connote a body of esoteric knowledge capable of generating awesome supernatural powers and even physical immortality, known or suspected practitioners?particularly those of the 'left-hand' path who may ritually engage in normally proscribed activities, such as extramarital sexual intercourse, the consumption of meat and liquor, or even human sacrifice?have often been both admired and feared. They are believed to have the power to invoke spirits to carry out their will, as well as deities in their dangerous wrathful or protective (raudra) aspects, or to practice 'black magic' (Hindi m?th, literally 'a fist') through fatal curses and spells. To call an image or ritual 'Tantric' suggests that it is charged with ambivalent occult energy or that it offers a secret shortcut to esoteric knowledge and powers. Tantric texts themselves often claim that they are especially effective in the present Kali Yuga, when older Vedic rituals have lost their power or are no longer understood. Many of these associations resonate with ancient understandings of Hanum?n, despite his reputation among academic scholars as a misty-eyed subaltern R?ma devotee. In the Sanskrit R?m?yana, the plucky monkey is already an exemplar of some characteristic Tantric values: A creature of a lower order, he transcends his condition through his own (often pugnacious) efforts and rapidly acquires divine boons and powers; he is taught esoteric knowledge by the sun-god and gains physical immortality and freedom from illness, which he also has the power to cure. Metaphorically (and sometimes genetically) linked with the powerful and potentially destructive gods V?yu, Agni, and Rudra, he exercises control over malevolent beings. His verbal skill is suggestive of mastery of the power of speech, which is also associated with knowledge of mantras. His journey to Lanka and subsequent deeds there are interpreted (by later epic commentators) as displaying all eight siddhis or occult powers, such as magical flight, the ability to find hidden things, and the power to enlarge or reduce one's size.6 All of these narrative traits came to be invoked in his worship that gathered momentum after the tenth century and often stressed his identity not only as a servant of R?ma but as an avat?ra of Rudra/Siva (an identification that dates back at least to the Satarudra Samhit? of the twelfth-century Siva Pur?na)?specifically as the eleventh and last Rudra.7 Nowadays he is often hailed as the 'deity-of-choice' for the debased Kali Yuga, when dharma is obscured and bare survival may depend on wit, brute strength, and good connections, all of which he has in spades. Yet, in the vast literature of medieval Tantric schools, Hanum?n proves again to be a 'marginal' and chronologically late presence. The editors of the special 'Hanum?n issue' (Hanum?n-ank) of the popular Hindi religious journal Kaly?n</page><page sequence="5">Hanuman and the popularization of Tantra I 273 (which was published in 1975 and has become a collector's item among both devotees and traditional scholars) regretfully concede the absence of references to Hanum?n in such authoritative S?kta compendia as the Kul?rnava Tantra and the S?rad?tilaka Tantra and the presence of only a few references to him in the Prapancas?ra Tantra and in the seventeenth-century Tantras?ra of Krsn?nanda (Kaly?n 1975: 489).8 Hanum?n scholar Ray Govindchandra (1976: 85) similarly notes the absence of any mention of the deity in the huge P?ncar?tra literature, Vaisnava theological and ritual manuals containing a great deal of Tantric material, produced mainly in southern India between the eighth and fourteenth centuries, and he cites only scattered references in later ritual texts.9 The centrality of mantra in the 'sonic theology' of Tantra?reflected in the belief that the esoteric 'seed formula' (bija-mantra) for a given deity is, in fact, identical with that deity and capable of summoning or manifesting him or her?led to the compilation, especially after 1100 CE, of large digests of mantras?stra, 'the science of mantra,1 containing hundreds of mantras with explanations for their use. It is only in some of the later examples of this class such as the Mantramahodadhi of Mah?dhara, composed in Varanasi in 1589, that we find short chapters devoted to Hanuman-w?/?/ras, an indication of his growing popularity during the period that corresponded to the floruit of the influential R?maite devotional poet Tuls?das (ca. 1543-1623).,0 Short texts devoted more or less exclusively to Hanum?n's Tantric worship? with rituals that utilize mantras, dhy?na (mental visualization), and yantras (mystic diagrams)?begin to appear in manuscript form only in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Some of these also contain instructions for making protective amulets inscribed with Hanum?n-ma/i/ras and for the assemblage of a 'shield' or charm (kavaca) made of mantras?a verbal armor extending a deity's protection over one's body and consciousness." Many of these texts claim to be excerpted from older works, especially the Brahm?nda Pur?na or the Sudarsana Samhit? (the latter said to be a section of the Tantras?ra), and are typically set in the dialog format characteristic of medieval Hindu narrative, although the teachings are usually identified as 'highly secret' or esoteric (parama rahasya). Thus we encounter titles such as Hanum?n Rahasya (The secret [worship] of Lord Hanum?n) as well as kavaca texts invoking the god in awesome, protective aspects. The latter include multiheaded manifestations of Hanum?n, the most common being the five-headed form but also including forms with three, seven, or eleven heads.12 Sculptural and painted evocations of this verbal icon also begin appearing in the fifteenth century: for example, a small pahcamukhi image at Mandasar in Madhya Pradesh; a sixteen-foot image carved into a cliff below Jodhpur Fort and said to have been made around 1500 by a R?m?nandi s?dhuP An image</page><page sequence="6">274 / Philip Lutgendorf dated to the early sixteenth century appears in bas-relief at the Ek?mbaresvara temple in Kanchipuram, Tamilnadu (Nagar 1995: Plates 6, 146). Such figures are found in greater numbers after the seventeenth century. K. C. Aryan's book on Hanum?n images contains a series of drawings of five-headed Hanum?n, also from Rajasthan, the earliest dated to the late seventeenth century; the multiheaded figure is sometimes densely inscribed with mantras (1975: 51, 52, 57, 59, 63; Nagar 1995: Plate 153b). Other two-dimensional images included in published collections include a Pah?ri-style painting from Jammu, dated to the eighteenth century, and several Mysore-style paintings attributed to the early nineteenth century (Nagar 1995: Plates 2, 5, 147^19, 151). Writing on Hindu mythology around 1800, the British soldier and chronicler Edward Moor puzzled over the meaning of one such five-faced image, with 'four animals represented in Hanum?n's coronet....A horse, a boar, a lion, and a bird' (1968: 262-63). A temple survey conducted at roughly the same time in Pune under Bajirao Pesv? recorded a single paficamukhi image among the eighty-nine M?ruti (Hanum?n) shrines in the Mar?th? city (the most, incidentally, to any single deity) (see Ghurye 1979: 147). That such a manifestation of Hanum?n at one time figured in the religious lives of some Nepali Hindus is indicated by the presence of a five-tiered temple dedicated to him in Kathmandu, said to have been constructed in 1655 CE. According to a modern account, the image is 'believed to be very Tantric in form and mysterious enough to accept even sacrificial offerings [that is, blood sacrifices]' but is off limits to the general public and accessible only to a priest who performs a daily 'secret service' (Deep 1993: 60). Further confirmation of this unusual Hanum?n's presence in Nepal, as well as of his apparently limited visibility there, is provided by the five headed metal sculpture (dated to the 'sixteenth-seventeenth centuries') that appears in Madanjeet Singh's survey, Himalayan art, wrongly identified as 'a manifestation of Vishnu' (1971: 213, see also 220).l4 In summary, we may characterize Pancamukh? Hanum?n's pre-twentieth-century representations as comparatively late and sporadic, although persistent and geographically widely attested. Although there is some variation in the iconography of five-faced Hanum?n, most images appear to follow the prescriptions of a single set of 'visualization verses' (dhy?na sloka) that are usually said to be excerpted from the Sudarsana Samhit?. These verses are introduced by others of a sort standard in Tantric anthologies that identify?according to a set of categories with ultimately Vedic reference?the basic features of the ritual 'shield' or kavaca being constructed by the worshiper.15 Thus, of the mantras of the stotra of the five-faced Hanum?n kavaca, Brahm?</page><page sequence="7">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 275 is the rsi* Gayatri is the meter, the awesome five-faced Hanum?n is presiding deity. Hrim is the seed mantra, s rim is the sakti, kraum is the nail,*6 kr?m is the shield, kraim is the weapon. Phatl Garuda said, 'Thus I will explain the visualization, listen, Lovely One. The Supreme Lord created this visualization of his beloved Hanum?n. ( 1 ) Having five faces, fifteen eyes, and ten arms, exceedingly terrible, it grants the fulfillment of all aims and desires. (2) To the east the face of a fierce monkey, radiant as a billion suns, a face having sharp teeth and arched eyebrows. (3) To the south the fierce face of the great being, man-lion, extremely terrible, with radiant form, awful, and fear-destroying. (4) To the west the fierce face of Garuda, with curved beak, immensely strong, stifling all serpents and destroying poisons, ghosts, and so on. (5) To the north the fierce face of a boar, dark and glittering as the firmament, destroyer of the netherworld, lions, ghouls, fevers, and so on. (6) Above, the terrible horse-face, supreme destroyer of demonic titans, the face, best of seers, that destroyed the great warrior T?rak?sura. (7) The one who seeks shelter will have all his enemies destroyed by visualizing the five-faced Rudra, Hanum?n, treasury of mercy' (8) (Mishra 1971: 132-34). The visualization continues with a description of the weapons (sword, trident, club, and so on) held in each of the deity's ten hands.17 This is followed by a series of ritual 'impositions* (ny?sa) of deities onto the limbs of the reciter's body, accompanied by mantras and gestures; likewise a standard feature of Tantric worship, they suggest why such rites are considered to bestow a protective spiritual 'shield.' Finally, there are long strings of mantras that combine (apparently meaningless) 'seed syllables' with salutations to 'the monkey' (markata) and to Hari (a name of Visnu, but also a synonym for 'monkey'). These are to be accompanied by oblations of water and by concen tration on the objects or goals to be obtained through the ritual: om hari markata-markat?ya bam bam barn bam bam vausat sv?h? om hari markata-markat?ya pham pham pham pham pham phata sv?h? om hari markata-markat?ya khem khem khem khem khem m?ran?ya sv?h?... (137). Such sequences of mantras, alternating with formulaic invocations of Hanum?n that recall his heroic deeds, continue for several pages. The kavaca concludes</page><page sequence="8">276 / Philip Lutgendorf with a stock passage identifying the benefits to be obtained from its recitation (phalasruti, 'a hearing of the fruit': By reciting this kavaca once, all enemies are destroyed. By reciting it twice, one obtains sons and grandsons. By reciting it thrice, all wealth is acquired, and four recitals destroy all ills. Five recitations give one power over all creatures, and six give power over all deities ( 139). The sequence continues to the symbolic Rudra-number of eleven recitations that 'give success in all undertakings' (140). Other manuals detail additional uses for this kavaca, however: for example, if written out on paper and carried in one's hand, it brings wealth; repeating it ten times at night (this would take quite a while) brings success at dice; written out on birchbark, red silk, or a palmieaf with ink made of three scents and placed in an iron amulet-case (lauh t?viz) that is then worn on waist, neck, head, or upper arm, the kavaca brings the fulfillment of all wishes (Gupta 1980: 148). The visualization evokes five animal forms associated with heroic and aggressive acts of Visnu. The slokas allude to the familiar mythological associations of these forms, and hence their relevance to a devotee's needs: Narasimha, the fear-destroying man-lion; Garuda, the enemy of snakes and antidote to venom and poison; the boar Var?ha, who plunged into the nether world to rescue the earth from demons; and the lesser-known 'horse-necked' Hayagriva (aka Hayavadana, sometimes ranked among the twenty-four 'minor' avat?ras of Visnu), who is likewise said to have gone to the netherworld to retrieve the Vedas. The composite deity would appear to consist as much of these other forms as of Hanum?n, yet the text identifies it as his own, and the monkey-face, in the auspicious eastern direction, is the nucleus that these other faces?each described as vakra (literally 'twisted,' but connoting 'fierce' or 'awesome')?enhance with their respective powers. In most two-dimensional images and bas-reliefs, the monkey-face appears in the central position, symmet rically flanked by the others, or sometimes with the horse head (or all the heads) emerging from his crown. In fully sculpted images, the monkey head generally faces the worshiper, and the accompanying body, complete with simian tail, belongs to it; the other heads are aligned as per the dhy?na prescription. Although the evolution of the five-faced Hanum?n image is unclear, its iconographie and theological roots are evidently hoary and suggest its dual association with both Vaisnava and Saiva traditions; we may also note the worship of the five dhy?ni buddhas of Tantric Buddhism, each associated with a primary color, direction, and mystical realm (Bharati 1965: 23), as well as the</page><page sequence="9">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra / 277 concept of the 'five winds' that are said to constitute collectively V?yu and pr?na, who the Sanskrit R?m?yana identifies as Hanum?n's father (although some later Pur?nic traditions have V?yu share this role with Siva). In an ambitious study of the pervasive 'multiplicity convention' in Indian art, Doris Srinivasan (1997: 163-66) demonstrates that the number five was used in Vedic liturgy and ritual to denote 'completeness* or totality and that some of the earliest identifiable Vaisnava and Saiva icons show a fivefold structure. These include pa?camukha litigas honoring Rudra/Siva (manifesting ferocious and beneficent faces oriented to the cardinal directions plus the sky) and representa tions of the pa?cavira, the five heroes of the Vrsni clan who were worshiped in the Mathur? region several centuries before the beginning of the Common Era (Srinivasan 1997: 119-23, 211-18, 233-35, 318-19). Srinivasan (1997: 218, 220) convincingly argues that the vira tradition contributed to the development of the Vaisnava catuny?ha doctrine and its related iconography, in which the supreme Lord N?r?yana produces four emanations bearing the names of Vrsni heroes, each represented by heads facing in the four cardinal directions. Such an image, referred to as vaikuntha caturm?rti ('the penetrating lord of four visages'), is described in the Visnudharmottara Pur?na, a text associated with the P?ncar?tra school and probably composed between 600 and 900 CE, as well as in other contemporary northern P?ncar?tra texts (for example, the Jay?khya Samhit?). This visualization features four heads oriented to the cardinal directions and most commonly places the anthropomorphic V?sudeva to the east, flanked by Narasimha and Var?ha to the south and north, respectively, with an 'angry' (raudra) head of the sage K?pila (or Kapila) to the west, adorned with earrings, a third eye, and the matted locks of a yogi (for example, Visnudharmottara Pur?na 3.44.9-12).18 Iconographie representations of such a figure likewise have a long history, possibly dating to as early as the second century BCE but are especially well attested to from ninth-century Kasm?ra, where P?ncar?tra doctrines were influential.'*These icons position the auspicious V?sudeva visage facing the worshiper and set the entire fourfold figure astride the divine bird Garuda (Srinivasan 1979: 44). Moreover, there exists at least one variation in which the 'angry,' rear-facing head of K?pila is replaced by that of a horse and another in which a horse head substitutes for that of the lion (Agrawala 1976: 388). Thus, all of the constituents of Pa?camukh? Hanum?n, with the exception of the monkey himself, were combined in earlier Vaisnava iconography to connote an epiphany of Visnu as cosmic creator and as embodi ment of protective and awesome powers. The visual parallel between this epiphany and the five-faced Hanum?n images?extending even to the directional placement of the lion and boar visages?seems too close to be merely coinci dental, yet the late dhy?na text makes no reference to P?ncar?tra doctrine or,</page><page sequence="10">278 / Philip Lutgendorf indeed, to Visnu; it appears unaware of any visual or theological precursors, even as it seems to have substituted effortlessly, at its visual center, a monkey's face for that of the supreme Lord V?sudeva/N?r?yana. Furthermore, no modern text on Hanum?n devotion (including the copious research of Govindchandra [1976]) and no devotee whom 1 interviewed on the subject of five-faced Hanum?n made any reference to Vaisnava catunn?rti images. One of my interviewees asserted that the five-faced Hanum?n image was devised in late medieval Karnataka by teachers of the Madhva tradition, who worshiped both Hanum?n and their founder, Madhv?c?rya, as avat?ras of pr?naNayu and who wanted their own fearsome Tantric protector-deity comparable to those worshiped by Saivas (for example, K?la Bhairava and V?rabhadra). Such a claim is not altogether implausible, for the more popular aspects of Madhva worship, indeed, gave particular prominence to Hanum?n, and he enjoyed evident popularity during the late Vijayanagara period, when Madhva teachers had some prominence in the court; yet given the relative paucity of premodern Pancamukh? Hanum?n images in South India, I am skeptical of this explanation. However, the possibility that?whatever its origins?the image's present popularity reflects a more recent process of what may be called 'Vaisnavization' or, alternatively, 'Tantrification' warrants further scrutiny, and I will return to it below. SECRETS FOR SALE These days, who worships such a 'Tantrified' Hanum?n, and how? I will defer addressing the former question for the moment, but to answer the latter?at least with reference to Hindi-language regions?I turn to a category of contemporary published texts devoted to the monkey-god and concerned both with his life narrative (jivancaritrd) and with the manner of his ritual worship (variously termed p?j?, up?sn?, ?r?dhn?, yaj?a, and anusth?na). At one end of the spectrum are texts primarily or even solely concerned with ritual (for example, Mishra 1971; Shukla nd), and, at the other, those devoted exclusively to the proliferating mythobiography that 1 have begun calling (only partly in jest) the 'Hanum?yana' (Dube 1989; Mishra 1987; Singh 1984). Others lie somewhere in between, covering both topics in a single convenient anthology (for example, Gopal 1989; Gupta 1980) or offering an exhaustive compendium incorporating the contributions of scores of authors (Kaly?n 1975). AU of these works are sold inexpensively in the kinds of shops and bookstalls that cater to Hindi-language readers and that typically carry, in addition to a wide range of popular religious</page><page sequence="11">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 279 texts (including editions of the R?mcaritm?nas, the Bhagavad Git?, and various Pur?nas with Hindi commentaries), self-help manuals on topics ranging from yoga and astronomy to herbal medicine, cooking, and sex, as well as detective novels, books of cinema songs, and collections of jokes. At such a shop, a request for 'books on Hanuman-j?' generally yields a small stack of specimens, ranging from crudely printed, misprint-plagued pamphlets of prayers and hymns, assembled by anonymous compilers and selling for a few rupees, to more expensive, attractively bound volumes written in elegantly Sanskritized Hindi by learned (usually Br?hmana) authors who append titles like Sastri to their names and who may offer distinctive personal interpretations of antholo gized mythological and liturgical texts. I have been using the terms 'ritual worship' and 'propitiation' to translate a variety of Hindi terms that connote worship that is intended to be 'fruitful' (sa-phala), aimed at producing worldly results of benefit to the worshipper or, in certain cases, of harm to someone else. At the more bhakti-o?ented, elite Vaisnava end of the spectrum of Hanum?n literature, there is a certain embarrass ment about such ritual practice, reflecting the notion that worship of Bhagav?n ideally should be selfless, done for its own sake and 'without desire' for results (nisk?ma). Thus the 528-page 'Hanum?n special issue' of Kaly?n introduces its section on up?sn? with a 'Request concerning ritual worship' by the Gita Press' longtime editor, Hanumanprasad Poddar, reminding readers of the ultimately transitory nature of mundane joys and sorrows and of the superiority of desireless devotion over rituals that seek divine intervention (Kaly?n 1975: 483-84). This is followed, however, by thirty double-columned pages devoted to precisely the latter aims. Most such manuals, however, are unapologetic about their readers' presumed objectives and get right to the point. Dinanath Shukla's Sri Hanumad Up?sn? (nd), for example, offers as its frontispiece a yantra diagram consisting of three concentric circles of Tantric bija-mantras surrounding an eight-petaled lotus, in the center of which the reader's own name is to be inscribed; the caption explains: if this is written on birchbark and worn in an amulet-case, obstacles such as ghosts, demons, and so on, do not bother you.' The author's preface matter-of-factly notes, in this world, hardly anyone undertakes any activity without the desire to obtain some result,...[and] in the Kali Yuga, the worship of R?ma's devotee, Hanum?n, has proven to yield the quickest and most abundant benefits' (Shukla nd: 5). If the ethical propriety of petitioning (or arm-twisting) the gods for favors is of little concern to the authors of these manuals, procedural correctness is another matter. Introducing his 160-page book on Hanum?n Up?sn?, Radhakrishna Shrimali stresses the universality of ritual invocation as well as some of its assumed ground rules:</page><page sequence="12">280 / Philip Lutgendorf All adherents of Hindu Dharma?Vaisnavas, Saivas, S?ktas, and adherents of San?tana Dharma?take recourse to ritual worship. It is a known truth that there is power in mantras. But knowledge of the order, proper pronunciation, and use of mantras is also absolutely necessary, for just as calling out the name of one among several sleeping persons causes that person to awaken, whereas the others go on sleeping, so only when mantras are correctly pronounced do they become effective and awaken the deities (nd: 1). Shrimali's metaphor suggests the notion, basic to Tantric ideology, that divine powers lie in a dormant state until aroused by worshipers and that such arousal requires knowledge and correct performance of the verbal codes that awaken a given deity. His preface goes on to explain another basic Tantric notion: The true meaning of up?sn? is to effect identity with a chosen deity. The ritual by means of which an individual can obtain substantial and spiritual unity with a chosen deity and his embodied qualities, virtues, physical attributes, and power?that alone is up?sn? (5). From what I have noted earlier concerning Hanum?n's qualities of strength, resourcefulness, and so on, it should be obvious why identification with him would be helpful to humble souls toiling through the dismal Kali Yuga. Shrimali's book presents a good example of modern popular Tantric-style manuals devoted to Hanum?n worship. In paperback format, and sold (in 1990) for the modest price of Rupees 10, it devotes only five of its 160 pages to stories of Hanum?n's deeds (recounting his infant-adventure of seizing the sun that resulted in his becoming further empowered by boons from all the principal Vedic gods) before turning to prescriptions for his propitiation through yantras and mantras. The chapter on yantras opens with an encouraging introduction: Hanum?n is a devat? who can be worshipped in all places and at all times, by all persons. Anyone, anywhere, at anytime can become freed of distress by remembering him. He stands in the first rank of deities who free from distress, destroy sorrows, and protect devotees. There is no task in the world that he cannot accomplish....Young and old feel themselves safe and secure by remembering him. Although he is incomparable in the realms of courage, valor, heroism, splendor, and intensity, Hanuman-j? is very simple-hearted, compassionate, and detached. He has no desires of his own. He constantly roams around in the guise of an ordinary monkey, but when a devotee calls out he takes any form, according to the circumstances, to make the impossible possible (25).</page><page sequence="13">Hanuman and the popularization of Tantra I 281 General prescriptions that follow note the importance of the color red that is said to be pleasing to Hanum?n; thus the worshiper should wear red clothing and offer red-colored foods and red flowers with masculine-gender names (the latter in view of his strict celibacy). Instructions for making yantras come next. According to all such handbooks, a yantra to be effective must not simply be drawn correctly in a prescribed manner but must be empowered through worship and the repetition of mantras. Once this is accomplished, it can be used to achieve specific ends. A few examples of specific yantra-based rituals from Shrimali's text: (i) A yantra of sixteen squares inscribed with various nasalized consonants (nam, chain, jam, cam, and so on?their sequence appears to be without semantic meaning) to be written out a total of 125,000 times in a series of equal installments spread over the course of 15, 17, 21, 25, or 27 days, followed by 108 fire-oblations (havana) and the feeding and gifting of Br?hmanas. If done 'according to prescription,' this ritual is said to guarantee a vision (darsana) of Hanum?n as well as the attainment of his grace (28-29). (ii) A 'fear-averting' yantra of eighty-one squares inscribed with letters to be written on a bananaleaf and worshipped for forty-five days, accompanied by 1,188 daily repetitions of a designated mantra (eleven circuits of the standard rosary of 108 beads), followed by a feast for Br?hmanas. The yantra may then be permanently installed in a home shrine-room and seen by all family members, although women should avoid approaching it during their monthly periods (29-31). (iii) A second fear-averting yantra, described as 'comparatively simple,' consists of a sixteen-part magic square containing numerals that add up to seventy-nine. It should be drawn, at midnight on the second of a lunar fortnight when the moon is waxing, on birchbark with a pen made of a pomegranate twig dipped in ink made of five scented oils, it is then worshipped with incense and a lamp and 108 recitations of om hanumate namah ('Om, salutations to Hanum?n!'). When thus activated, the yantra is to be buried in a two-foot deep hole near the entrance to the place in which one feels fearful; 'from this practice, the fear-inducing qualities (tattva) of that place will be destroyed' (31 ). (iV) One of several yantras for dispelling ghosts' consists of two downward pointing triangles, one within the other, which are in turn set within two rectangles. It is to be drawn, on the eighth night of a dark lunar fortnight, on a piece of cloth obtained on the preceding Sunday or Tuesday night from the shroud of a corpse at the cremation ground and is to be written with black ink made of the drug dhat?r? (a poison sacred to Siva) using a crow's feather or iron needle.20 The name of the ghost-possessed person is to be written inside the innermost triangle. This yantra is then worshipped with mantras and ultimately</page><page sequence="14">282 / Philip Lutgendorf buried in the cremation ground (35-36). It would appear to have the aim of drawing the offending ghost out of its victim and confining it in its proper mortuary precinct. The chapter devoted to mantras again stresses the necessity of following directions properly: Of course, any devotee can remember his chosen deity with faith and devotion and using mantras, anywhere and at anytime, but as far as efficacious ritual (anusth?na) is concerned, it can only display its full power when done according to prescription (44). It then offers similarly elaborate prescriptions devoted to specific complaints, for example: (i) A mantra to insure success on a journey or in any other undertaking consists of an apparently meaningless Hindi couplet in doh? meter, to be recited 12,500 times daily for three days, followed by 1,250 havana oblations. This serves to activate the mantra. Thereafter, it may be used at any time by reciting it nine times into the palms of one's freshly washed hands and by then lightly running them over one's head, chest, arms, and legs. Then, 'wherever one goes, one will definitely meet with success' (46). (ii) A mantra for 'sweeping away' migraine headaches is to be recited seven times while blowing the ash of burned cowdung in the face of the afflicted person. Although many mantras consist of long strings of difficult Sanskrit formulae, this one mixes simple Sanskrit with a nursery rhyme-like Hindi stanza; it is also rather unusual in making a direct and even playful reference to the invoked deity: Om salutations! Born in the forest, monkeys climb trees, leap from branch to branch, and eat raw, wild fruits. Half they tear, half they split, half they let fall. When Hanuman-j? roars, migraine goes away (47). Other mantras are offered for curing gastric complaints (46) and toothache (47-^48) and for the activation of a peacock-feather fan to be used to 'sweep away' ghosts (56), particularly from small children. The latter prescription adds an element of coercion based on the threat of disgrace: After being placated with various offerings, Hanum?n is told that if he fails to carry out the suppliant's wishes, 'You will have disgraced Mother A?janf s milk!' (56). The examples given above, drawn from a single inexpensive paperback, are fairly representative of those found in many other widely available manuals that</page><page sequence="15">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 283 may be said to typify the more proletarian end of the ritual literature devoted to Hanum?n. Religious bookstores generally carry a variety of books devoted to Hanum?n's propitiation, and these also include more Sanskritized anthologies that contain far less explanatory and how-to passages and are evidently designed to appeal to an audience with at least some training in Br?hmanical ritual. An example of this category of work is Hanumad-rahasyam (Esoteric worship of Hanum?n), an anthology edited by Shivadatt Mishra. This clothbound book, first published in Ba?aras in 1971 and in its third edition in 1980 (when it sold for Rupees 16), opens with a benedictory preface by Sv?mi Karp?tri, a leader of the orthodox Dandi or 'staff-bearing' ascetics who trace their spiritual descent from Sankar?c?rya. Here, too, the narrative portion of the book comprises a mere four pages and recounts only one of Hanum?n's birth stories. The largest item in the anthology is a 96-page Sanskrit manual for Hanum?n-pw/tf, accompanied by a terse Hindi gloss. The text is attributed to one Nath?n?r?yana of Jaipur, who composed it in 1897. The p?j? it prescribes is highly elaborate: the list of required ingredients runs to sixty-eight items, including costly spices, oils, and scents, and the gloss casually alludes to procedures that would be impossible for anyone but an orthodox Vaidika Br?hmana (for example, 'Then enter your ritual fire area and perform homa according to your scriptural lineage' [30]). Much of the manual is generic, however, and, apart from occasional invocations of Hanum?n (who is first mentioned thirty pages into the text), could as easily be applied to many deities. There are more than twenty pages of mantras to accompany ny?sa, 'superimpositions' (33-57). Hanum?n then briefly returns as the subject of a dhy?na or visualization, followed by twenty more pages of mantras to accompany fire-oblations (64-86). The manual concludes with a passage likewise characteristic of such works: After final instructions that advocate carrying out the entire ritual three times a day, it offers, in the event that this is not possible, a series of acceptable and rapidly diminishing substitu tions: for example, performing it twice, or only once, or merely on the full or new moon days of each month, eventually paring everything down to the offering of a single water libation accompanied by a 'pure mind' (94-95). Mishra's anthology includes other Sanskrit texts as well, and each of these is attributed to an authoritative scriptural source. Thus its section on Tantric worship with mantras (including a recipe for gaining power over enemies by making an image of Hanum?n out of clay and ash obtained from a cremation ground and another for summoning up a private succubus?a v?tala?to carry out one's will and foretell the future) is said to be excerpted from the Mantra mahodadhi; its version of the popular Pa?camukhl Hanum?n kavaca is attributed to the Sudarsana Samhit? (132^0). In addition, it includes similar liturgies for invoking seven- and eleven-headed manifestations of the deity,</page><page sequence="16">284 / Philip Lutgendorf allegedly drawn respectively from the Atharvana Rahasya and the Agastya Samhit? (140-51). Only in its final thirty pages does it incorporate, along with instructions for their ritual use, the Hindi-language prayers?Hanum?n C?lis?, Bajrahg Ban, and so on?that are most familiar to modern devotees (266-302). This is perhaps appropriate in what is, after all, billed as a book of 'esoteric secrets' (rahasya). But reading Mishra's elaborate prescriptions may leave one wondering: Does anyone actually perform these rituals? APE-OTHEOSIS NOW The numerous self-help manuals for Hanum?n's propitiation appear, to an outsider, to embody several paradoxes. Sold at low cost in bookshops that cater primarily to those of modest education, they stress the ease and accessibility of Hanum?n worship, even as they prescribe rituals that are often of the most daunting complexity. They also repeatedly assert the danger of ritual error and the necessity of having a guru's guidance, even as they themselves attempt to circumvent this need with step-by-step directions.2' They invoke the authority of Sanskrit mantras and of Br?hmana priests, even as they democratically offer allegedly 'secret' rituals to any literate person willing to make a small monetary outlay. They are ubiquitous enough that they must have an audience?for this type of ephemeral literature does not survive long unless it finds buyers?yet, in my fieldwork, I encountered few worshipers who expressed interest in such texts; more commonly, I was told that the great appeal of Hanum?n results from the very simplicity and informality of his worship, from the fact that he displays 'quick satisfaction' at the mere chanting of r?ma-n?ma or the recitation of the Tulsid?s Sundark?nd or the even shorter and folksier Hanum?n C?lis?. Several people contrasted him, in this respect, to a goddess such as Durg?, who likes to hear herself praised in the long Sanskrit eulogy, Durg? Saptasatl, but who may be angered if one mispronounces a word. The copious lore of Tantra has perhaps always been disproportionate to the actual number of its practitioners, at least in its more demanding forms. To a researcher, it may seem that no one actually does it, although nearly everyone claims to know of someone who does; in any case, those who actually pursue Tantric practice may tend not to talk about it. In Ba?aras, my periodic inquiries into Tantric Hanum?n worship led me to an aged Maharashtrian pandita living on one of the southern gh?ts. This man, who was in his eighties when I interviewed him in 1990, was said to be an adept at Hanum?n's Tantric up?sn?, through which he had acquired certain supernatural powers and the unique</page><page sequence="17">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 285 privilege of being permitted to touch and personally serve all the temple images of Hanum?n in the city, including the renowned Sa?kata Mocana m?rti that is otherwise strictly off limits to all except the temple's own Br?hmana priests. When I interviewed this venerated man, he proved to be quite friendly and approachable but, not surprisingly, was disinclined to discuss his own ritual practice. As for the printed manuals, he gleefully noted that their texts were corrupt and error-ridden; no one could follow them without the guidance of a guru, in which case the printed version would be superfluous anyway. He doubted whether they attracted many actual practitioners, and when I pointed out their wide availability, he simply shrugged his shoulders and chuckled. Yet his own acquired skills were soon displayed when, in the course of our conversa tion, a young man entered the pandita's small room. After a brief whispered exchange, the old pandita felt the newcomer's pulse, then placed his hand on his own throat, and blew repeatedly into the other's face. The pandita's middle aged son, also in the room, explained to me that the visitor was seeking help for a medical condition that had proven resistant to standard treatment and that many people came to his father in such circumstances. The pandita was concentrating on memorized mantras, lodged 'in his throat,' that he had previously 'activated' through ritual repetition; now summoning their power, he was communicating that power to the other man through his breath. All these practices were, indeed, described in the popular books we had just been discussing. Healing by blowing (ph?hkn?) is a common feature of folk medicine in North India, especially in rural areas, where its practitioners are often of low status and sometimes heal while in a state of possession by a local devat?. Here the practitioner was a learned Br?hmana, and 'possession' (in the usual sense involving loss of self-control) was not part of the ritual but was replaced by memorized formulae, presumably in Sanskrit, that enabled him to tap the power of his presiding deity: the 'son of the wind,* who also has a special association with the vivifying breath or pr?na. Certainly it is not necessary for a ritual to be widely practiced in order for it to possess authority, particularly if it is reified in a printed form that purports to embody the secret wisdom of ancient, authoritative texts. Like certain novice cooks, some devotees may derive satisfaction from the mere possession of books containing elaborate recipes that they are themselves unlikely ever to try. They do not doubt that Hanum?n, as an avat?ra of Rudra, would respond to such propitiation, but they also trust that he equally responds to their recital of simple hymns, like the Hanum?n C?lis? and Bajrahg Ban, that these books likewise contain. Such largely symbolic invocation of 'Tantric' ritual is simi larly suggested by the several available pamphlet-sized versions of Tuls?d?s' Sundark?nd that are printed in red ink and advertised on their covers as 'suitable</page><page sequence="18">286 / Philip Lutgendorf for Tantric worship.' It is, of course, suggested as well by the dissemination of poster images of the 'Tantric' Pa?camukh? Hanum?n, whose precise icono graphie significance likewise eludes most viewers, although he conveys a desirable aura of esoteric power. I would like to conclude by proposing that the spread of such iconography and popular literature may reveal broader processes within mainstream, and especially middle-class, Hinduism that are deserving of notice. 1 have already spoken of 'accessibility' and 'democratization* as inherent in the very printing of such ostensible esot?rica, but I would now like to introduce the terms 'Vaisnavization' and 'Tantrification' to label complementary processes that are likewise suggested by these materials.22 A text like the Hanumad-rahasyam would no doubt be regarded, by a scholar of medieval Tantric traditions, as a vulgar, latter-day appropriation of esoteric Saiva/S?kta beliefs and practices; moreover, it is a text that, through its invocation of the R?ma narrative, subordinates Siva to Visnu as the latter's exemplary devotee. It may thus be cited as an instance of a broader process of 'Vaisnavization' that a number of scholars have viewed as characteristic of the evolution of popular Hinduism during the past millennium and especially during the past several centuries, a process that has figured in the growing status of both the R?ma and Krsna stories and in the physical evolution of pilgrimage sites associated with these narratives.23 Such a transformation, these scholars argue, is not simply a matter of changing devotional tastes or of substitution of nomenclature but indicates a preference for the pan-Indie, Sanskritic, and Br?hmanical over the local, vernacular, and folk. It also reflects, in certain specific instances, local aspira tions for improved social status such as the 'caste uplift' movements that developed from the late nineteenth century among a number of formally Sudra level agricultural and artisan castes in North-central India, such as the Ah?rs, Kurm?s, and Sonars. These empowering movements were often championed by Sit?-R?ma- and Hanum?n-worshiping s?dhus of the R?m?nandl order and were accompanied by tangible expressions of Vaisnava piety, such as the adoption of a vegetarian diet and the construction of caste temples and dharmas?l?s in Vaisnava pilgrimage centers (Pinch 1996: especially 81-114). In addition, there is no doubt that Saiva traditions in general, and Tantra in particular, endured an especially harsh critique during the second century of colonial rule?dismissed in British discourse as (at best) 'primitive superstition' and (at worst) 'hellish abomination'?whereas Vaisnava theology and legend (Krsna's amours excepted) were sometimes guardedly admired for their supposed resemblance to Protestant Christianity. The long-resounding echoes of such critiques, which were directly absorbed by the English-educated Hindu elite but which filtered down to reinforce the indigenous puritanism of mercantile</page><page sequence="19">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 287 communities and of upwardly mobile artisan and agricultural groups, may be seen in the mythological and ritual sanitization of such once-s?kta deities as the 'seven sisters' of the Punjab hills or the goddess Kh?ra Bhavan? of Kashmir; such goddesses have, in comparatively recent times, become vegetarian, fallen in love with Visnu, and (interestingly enough) acquired Hanum?n as their door guardian (dv?rap?la), often supplanting or counterbalancing, in their entourage, the darker and more ominous Rudra-avat?ra, Bhairava.24 Yet I want to argue that this sanitization has never been total; something like an opposite or complementary process has also occurred, especially in the post Independence period. Indeed, the modern 'Tantric' literature and iconography of Hanum?n challenges any easy assumptions regarding alleged 'Vaisnavization.' It disseminates purportedly esoteric techniques and images aimed at individual satisfaction and empowerment and places allusions to Vaisnava narrative within a ritual context that is squarely Saiva/S?kta. Indeed, it might as well be charac terized as an example of the 'Tantrification' of Vaisnavism, reflecting a yearning among many mainstream, San?tan? Hindus in North India for access, through a feisty demigod with squarely populist associations and a reputation tor delivering the goods, to sources of transformative power associated with potent and esoteric paths. A R?m?yatia scholar in Ba?aras remarked to me that the appeal of Pa?camukh? Hanum?n, like that of astrology and 'Tantra mantra,' is rooted in modern people's desire for a 'quick fix' for their worldly problems. The reputed adoption of 'Tantric' practices by prominent politicians, movie stars, and businessmen, he noted, helps to give them greater appeal (C. N. Singh, interview, 20 March 1990). If Hanum?n's association with explicitly Tantric texts and rituals is compara tively recent, his connection with the magical fulfillment of wishes?one of the most desired side benefits of Tantric practice?is certainly hoary and may ultimately be rooted in the ancient popular cult of the demi-divine and morally ambivalent yaksas, many of whom appeared in animal form and were propitiated with blood sacrifices. The divine hierarchy of South Asian popular religion has long included a number of efficacious, midlevel divine agents whose charac teristics, according to a number of scholars, suggest yaksa roots and resonances (for example, Ganesa, Hanum?n, and Skanda).25 Yet the popularity of any of these enduring 'folk' deities should not be assumed to be a given and constant but rather should be situated within the context of changing historical and socioeconomic circumstances in specific regions of the subcontinent. Writing on late twentieth-century Sri Lanka, Gananath Obeyesekere (1977: 391) has described the 'rise and fall' of a number of deities traditionally revered by both Hindus and Buddhists, particularly the meteoric rise during the twentieth century of the 'emergent national deity,' Skanda (aka Katar?gama), a deity who</page><page sequence="20">288 / Philip Lutgendorf resembles Hanum?n in a number of respects. Skanda is a second-generation god whose birth narrative figures prominently in his mythology, who is strongly linked to Siva, and who manifests both heroic martial power and an alluring beauty that elicits devotion. Above all Skanda is efficacious: 'He is par excellence the resourceful deity, the vanquisher of the asuras, the deity who could overcome obstacles' (Obeyesekere 1977: 389). Obeyesekere relates the rising popularity of Skanda to concrete developments such as improved road access to his principal pilgrimage-shrine but also to a set of problems faced especially by urban Sri Lankans in the second half of the twentieth century, including the consequences of democratization and bureaucratization of the state and of rising economic expectations that were often frustrated by the lingering power of traditional and colonial elites: '(1) the existence of new culturally desirable goals, (2) the hazy pathways available for achieving them, (3) the high aspiration levels with the increasing awareness of the near-impossibility of achieving them' (1977: 389). Similarly, I have elsewhere argued that the phenomenal proliferation (and literal growth) of Hanum?n shrines and images in recent decades should likewise be attributed to the patronage of the emerging, yet relatively insecure, 'middle classes' of contemporary India, who face comparable challenges in their aspira tions for the good life in a postcolonial market-driven, consumer society (Lutgendorf 1997: 325-27). In a Kali Yuga of spiraling consumerism, corrup tion, and inflation, middle-class worshipers feel they need all the help and protection they can get, but they are also fearful of the rustic stigma of the 'primitive' and the uncontrolled. They desire the 'quick fix' of Tantra but within the context of the respectable Vaisnava piety long advocated by prosperous mercantile groups. In contrast to the truly unruly Bhairava, 'the god of trans gression par excellence' (Visuvalingam 1989: 157), the half-feral Hanum?n seems more domesticated and user-friendly, an embodiment of Siva whose Rudra-rages are restricted to their proper demonic targets and whose reverence for dharma is beyond question. The divine monkey manages to combine Siva's propensity for being easily pleased (?sutosa) with R?ma's regard for 'dignity' and self-limitation (mary?d?) and to blend Rudra-Bhairava's raw and edgy energy with an adamantine yogic calm and a Vaisnavized emotional flux. He is, as his devotees often remark with satisfaction, the embodiment of both sakti and bhakti: a pleasant-sounding formula that (I have argued elsewhere) encapsulates an entire history of sometimes-contending theologies and praxes (Lutgendorf 1994:240-41). Such 'encapsulation' (and the modern consumer appreciates the convenience of patent medicines) is made visible, I suggest, in the mysterious image of five faced Hanum?n, an epiphany that reveals the humble 'servant of R?ma' growing</page><page sequence="21">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 289 to incorporate not simply the fivefold powers of the awesome Saiva deities of the classical Tantric pantheon but the majesty of Visnu-N?r?yana himself as embodied in his vy?has and avat?ras. Leaving aside the esoteric interpretations that (as we have seen) historically have been associated with the individual heads, this image most obviously confronts the viewer with a kind of cosmic form or visvar?pa, reminiscent of that assumed by Krsna in the climactic eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita and itself now visually familiar through multiheaded poster and video incarnations.26 The ease with which Hanum?n? whose eruptions into gigantism punctuate his role in the R?m?yana narrative? can assume this stature, the logic of the visual theology that it encodes, is suggested by the phenomenon of its proliferation in the absence of narrative exegesis. A visualization of an empowering, but mostly unknown, mantra, it requires, for most devotees, no further explanation than the fact that it 'has a lot of sakti.' It displays a god who manages to be at once 'Vaisnava,' 'Saiva,' and 'Tantric,' a 'minor' and subaltern-turned middle-class deity caught in the act of assuming an integral and encompassing role. Notes 1. This research was supported by a Professional Development Award from the University of Iowa and the American Institute of Indian Studies. 2. On the implications of muscularity in god-poster iconography, see Jain (nd); Lutgendorf (nd). 3. Bhagavati Prasad Singh of Gorakhpur University, Ayodhya, author of numerous learned works on R?ma-bhakti, appeared puzzled by the image, finally calling it 'a symbol of primordial energy' (?di sakti k? pratik): neither he nor his brother seemed familiar with it (interview, 5 April 1990). Similarly, R?mcaritm?nas aficionado Chandradharprasad Narayan Singh of Ba?aras noted that the image was rarely encountered in his area forty years ago but has now become commonplace (interview, 20 March 1990). 4. A very few devotees identified the image as a particular 'ferocious form' (ugrar?pa) assumed by Hanum?n in order to slay a specific demon, most commonly Ahir?vana (or Mahir?vana), the subterranean double of the king of Lanka who, in a popular folk expansion of the R?m?yatia narrative, kidnaps R?ma and Laksmana to offer them as human sacrifices to his own Tantric guardian goddess (see Lutgendorf 1997: 319-21; Smith 1988: 145-53); Hanum?n makes a daring foray into the netherworld and rescues them, slaying the demon (others, however, claim that the form Hanum?n assumed on this occasion was eleven-headed and twenty-two-armed, a figure seldom encountered</page><page sequence="22">290 / Philip Lutgendorf in iconography). The association of the five-faced image with this story seems appropriate in that both are energetic and autonomous manifestations of the god that operate largely independent of his human master and become the central focus of interest; moreover, both have shadowy and 'Tantric' associations. Yet the specific features of the pa?camukhi image are not, to my knowledge, mentioned in any of the many texts that retell the Ahir?vana story, and the most common poster image alluding to this tale?in which Hanum?n bears the rescued princes on his shoulders and suppresses the demon under one foot? shows the monkey in his normal, single-headed form. More characteristically, the single modern Hindi anthology of Hanum?n tales in my collection that briefly notes the five-faced form confirms its lack of an explanatory narrative, observing, 'Although one finds no story of such an incarnation, worship texts describe its propitiation' (Singh 1984: 18). 5. Gupta, Hoens, and Goudriaan (1979: 7-9) offer a useful list of eighteen constituents characteristic of Tantric traditions, including the valuing of mundane aims alongside spiritual emancipation, the use of mantras, yantras, and m?ndalas, and the identification of the microcosm of the human body with the cosmic macrocosm. 6. In their analysis of V?lmlki's Sundarak?nda, Goldman and Sutherland Goldman (1996: 53-57) provide a survey of most of the traits that figure prominently in Hanum?n's later worship and that are prefigured in the Sanskrit epic. 7. See the twentieth chapter of the Satarudra Samhit? of the Siva Pur?na (1970, 3: 1154-157). This identification with Rudra is referred to by many medieval R?maite authors (for example, Vinaya Patrik? 26:1, 27:3, Tuls?das 1982: 37, 40) and is more or less constantly invoked in modern popular literature devoted to Hanum?n. 8. The comments appear in an editor's note prefacing the article, 'Vividh Mantrorn Dv?r? Sri Hanum?n k? Up?sn?' (489-95), for which no author is cited. The dating of the older Tantras is a notoriously inexact science, somewhat comparable to that of the Pur?nas. Goudriaan and Gupta (1981: 94, 131, 135) date the Kul?rnava to 'between about 1000 and 1400 AD,' the S?rad?tilaka (attributed to the Kashmiri Saiva Laksmanadesika) to the eleventh century, and the Prapancas?ra to the tenth or eleventh centuries. 9. One of these is the Agastya Samhit?, a twelfth-century North Indian text that, according to Bakker (1986: 77), represents a link between southern P?ncar?tra traditions and later North Indian R?ma-devotees such as the R?m?nandis, for whom it became an authoritative text for temple rituals. Although this text is almost exclusively devoted to the ritual worship of R?ma and to the elaboration of a Rama-centered theology, its thirty-second chapter</page><page sequence="23">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 291 contains a mantra for the invocation of Hanum?n, who is said to grant spiritual liberation (mukti) and to dispel various classes of malevolent spirits, that is, bh?ta, pr?ta, pis?ca, d?kinl yaksa, and r?ksasa (Govindchandra 1976: 82, 85). 10. On the contents of the Mantramahodadhi, see Goudriaan and Gupta (1981: 137); see also their comments on the Mantrakamal?kara (137-38), another Tantric compendium including a section devoted to Hanum?n. The Tantras?ra, which the authors date to the late sixteenth century, is discussed on pages 139-40. 11. van der Veer (1988: 123) cites the popularity of the Hanumat Kavaca among Ty?gis, the yogic-style ascetic branch of the Ramanand? order that retains the influence of Saiva and N?tha ascetic traditions; it is likely that this text was composed by sectarian preceptors during the period of rapid growth of this order (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries), when the assimilative R?manand?s were challenging the dominance of Saiva Gosa?rn and Dasanam?s. 12. A perusal of catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts reveals a modest number of examples of texts entitled Hanumat Kavaca or Pahcamukhi Hanumat Kavaca, often said to be excerpted from either the Brahm?nda Pur?na or the Sudarsana Samhit?', of those that bear copying dates in their colophons, none predates the seventeenth century. Thus, the Ba?aras Hindu University collection includes thirteen Hanumat Kavaca manuscripts, the oldest dating to 1840 CE, and six Pancamukh? Hanumat Kavaca manuscripts, of which the oldest is dated 1828 CE. The collection of the Vrindaban Research Institute includes six Hanumat Kavaca texts (the oldest dated 1646 CE) and sixteen Pancamukh? Hanumat Kavaca manuscripts (most undated, but the oldest dated one having been copied in 1870 CE). The catalogues of the R. V. Sahitya Sansthan Research Library, Udaipur, list four manuscripts of the Pancamukh? Hanumat Kavaca, all undated, and one text (likewise undated) entitled Pancamukh? Vira Hanum?n-mantra. 13. On the Mandasar image, see Govindchandra (1976: 336); Nagar (1995: 264). The Jodhpur image is described in Sharma (1975: 424); its oral history was narrated to me by local devotees in 1996. 14. Singh connects this image with vy?ha forms of Visnu worshiped in Kashmir, an association that may well be historically warranted (see below, note 17 and accompanying text). However, the Nepali image shows the standard alignment of heads described in the Pancamukh? Hanum?n Dhy?nam to be discussed shortly and the forward- (presumably eastward- ) facing head is clearly that of a ferocious monkey (Singh mistakenly calls it, on page 220, 'a demon'); the figure stands astride a recumbent female, presumably a suppressed demon. See also the Nepali painting, identified as 'nineteenth century,' in Nagar (1995:</page><page sequence="24">292 / Philip Lutgendorf Plate 3). Another Nepali image, together with three others from Pah?ri schools of painting, is briefly discussed by Bhattacharyya in his book, Iconology of composite images (1980). Citing a single Nepali manuscript that terms the image 'Hanu-Bhairava' and clearly unaware of the tradition of five-headed representa tions of Hanum?n and their significance, Bhattacharyya (1980: 22-24) places the image in his chapter on 'dual forms.' He also mistakenly identifies the heads in two of the paintings, reading the lion or man-lion head as a jackal or 'an animistic human face' (Bhattacharyya 1980: 22). However, the Pahar? painting from Guler now in the Bharat Kala Bhavan Museum in Ba?aras (reproduced by both Aryan [1975] and Bhattacharyya [1980]) is, indeed, atypical and apparently unique, substituting a human head (K?pila?) for the horse and an elephant head (Ganesa?) for the lion (Bhattacharyya 1980: Plate 18). 15. The translation offered here is based on the Sanskrit text with Hindi commentary offered in Mishra ( 1971: 132-40). For a somewhat variant text in a comparable popular format, see Shukla (nd: 196-202). All other translations from Hindi elsewhere in this paper are mine as well. 16. Kilaka literally means 'nail,' 'pin,' or 'bolt.' In the Vedic tradition, it refers to a key element in powerful mantras that (so to speak) 'nails down' their efficacy (see Coburn 1991: 104-5, 107-8). 17. The ninth sloka lists the objects as sword, trident, khatv?hga ('skull staff,* a weapon of Bhairava), noose, goad, mountain, fist, mace, tree, and waterpot. Visual representations often show considerable variation from this list, with some of Hanum?n's hands holding Vaisnava symbols, such as a conch, lotus, and discus or a rosary and bell; on the other hand (so to speak), a severed head may also appear (see plates in Aryan [1975] and Nagar [1995] cited above). 18. Srinivasan (1979) speculates that such images represent a visualization of the early Vaisnava vy?ha cosmogony that is already attested in the N?r?yaniya section of the Mah?bh?rata (12.321-38). She proposes that the lion and boar heads were originally intended to signify the vy?has Samkarsana and Aniruddha (with K?pila representing Pradyumna) rather than avat?ras, but that the vy?ha doctrine later merged with the practice of the early bhakti Bh?gavata tradition that worshiped Krsna and four of his kinsmen as the 'five heroes' (pa?cavira). (I am grateful to John Stratton Hawley for referring me to Srinivasan's article and to the tradition of vaikuntha caturm?rti images.) 19. Srinivasan (1979: 41-43, 1997: 218-20) argues that a four-sided sculpture from Bhita in Allahabad district, dated to the second century BCE and previously identified as a 'fourfold yaksa,' is in fact such a caturvy?ha Visnu image. 20. Both crow and black metal are traditionally associated with the malefic planetary deity Sani (Saturn), who inflicts grievous sufferings (that may include</page><page sequence="25">Hanum?n and the popularization of Tantra I 293 ghostly possession) on those who come under his influence. The widespread custom of worshipping at Hanum?n temples on Saturday is commonly attrib uted to the desire to counteract the baleful 'gaze' of this planet. 21. For example, 'Mantras should be received from a guru, not from books' (Srivastav 1975: 509). "A yaj?a is not something to be learned from a book or through correspondence; one should seek instruction from a knowledgeable person' (Singh 1984: 299); the author then proceeds to give elaborate instruc tions for such a ritual. 22.1 intend the evocation of M. N. Srinivas' well-known label, 'Sanskritiza tion,' as well as the American sociological term 'gentrification,' although 1 will argue that something like the reverse of these processes is also involved in five faced Hanum?n's popularity. 23. For example, Vaudeville's argument, in 'Braj, lost and found' (1976), that the local religion of Vrindavan and its environs centered around the worship of Siva, local mother goddesses, and snake deities prior to the arrival of Bengali Vaisnava 'missionaries' in the fifteenth century. Similarly, Bakker (1986: 125, 145) and van der Veer (1988: 15, 90) argue for the preeminence of Saiva and N?tha yogi sacred sites in Ayodhy? prior to the twelfth century and a gradual 'Vaisnavization' that accelerated only after the sixteenth century. Verghese (1995: 7-9) notes that the popular religion of the city of Vijayanagara appeared to be Saiva prior to the sixteenth century, when a shift in courtly patronage occurred that favored the Srivaisnava and (to a lesser extent) Madhva traditions. 24. On the Punjab hill goddesses' transformation from S?kta to (nominally) Vaisnava figures, see Erndl (1993: 43-48). Wangu (1988: 175-83) attributes the shift in the iconography and diet of Kh?ra Bhavan?, as well as her association with R?ma and Hanum?n, to middle-class Kashmiris' discomfort with their Tantric heritage in the aftermath of the British critique (see also Lutgendorf 1999:31-32). 25. For a summary of the arguments concerning Hanum?n's possible origins as a simian yaksa, see Narula (1991: 20). On Ganesa's relation to yaksas, see Courtright (1985: 9, 130-31). On Skanda, see Coomaraswamy (1993: 45). 26. Srinivasan (1997: 137-41) argues that the totalizing metaphysical connotation of visvar?pa as divine 'omniform' is vital to the development of multiform iconography. Interestingly, she also distinguishes between early four and five-faced images of Visnu and Siva that seem to represent 'theological statements' and 'do not tell a story' and later multiheaded and multiarmed images that allude to Pur?nic narratives and to the divine lilas celebrated by devotional traditions (Srinivasan 1997: 12-13). In this sense, the narrative-less Pancamukh? Hanum?n appears as an exemplar of the older, and more theologi cally ambitious, variety.</page><page sequence="26">294 / Philip Lutgendorf References cited Agrawala, R. C. 1976.
