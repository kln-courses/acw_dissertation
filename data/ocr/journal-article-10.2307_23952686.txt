<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nature of Metaphysical Thinking, by Dorothy Emmet. Pp. xi + 238. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1945. xos. 6d. Miss Emmet's able and valuable study should prove most instructive to two types of students, those interested in the epistemological questions connected with sense-perception and those whose concern is for the fortunes of a living Theology. If her first four chapters form an able defence of the ' common-sense ' belief in a real external world against the pure phenomenalists from Hume downwards and their successors, the Logical Positivists, the remaining six are an equally vigorous polemic against all varieties of thought which deny the possi bility of a genuine apprehension of God ' by natural reason from the antiquated 'scientific agnosticism' of the 1870's to the Neo-Calvinist Fideism of which Karl Barth is the prophet. As is made abundantly clear, the two varieties of scepticism have a common root in their denial of the very possibility of Metaphysics : Metaphysics stands or falls with the capacity of human knowledge to apprehend the transcen dent. The human mind has admittedly, in the last resort, to gather all its knowledge from the processes of its own experiencing, but the question remains whether, in and through the ' subjective ' processes of experiencing, it does not attain awareness of objects beyond and other than those processes themselves. May it not be true that know ledge by experience is always knowledge of more than the actual contents of the experiencing itself ? This is, of course, just what Hume and all consistent Immanentists are bound to deny, and what Reid, to take only one example, meant to assert in his classical assault on the whole conception of ' ideas ' as the immediate objects of our knowledge. If it were true that my experiences bear witness to no existence beyond, the fact of their own occurrence, there could be, as Hume saw so clearly, no rational ground for belief in the real existence of a world which continues to exist whether I am experiencing it or not, nor of a personal self, which, whatever it may be, is certainly not an 'impression on my mind', and a fortiori no ground for belief in God. Indeed, it would be hard to dispute the allegation of the Logical Positivists that assertions and denials about a real world, a personal self, God, are all alike mere noises without any meaning. The ' plain man ' is not a metaphysician, and it is often easy to induce him to doubt the possibility of attaining knowledge about God; but he also habitually and stubbornly takes the reality of transcendence</page><page sequence="2">120 · THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES for granted. He takes it for granted that the 'outer world' is there, and is what it is, no matter whether he happens to be experiencing its behaviour or not, and that his experiences really tell him something about the nature of this real world. He is equally sure that he himself, who has the experiences, is something real, and that he is something quite different from any ' impression' or sequence of impressions. And he remarks that the Immanentists themselves neverseem really to believe for long together in their professed reduction of knowledge to the mere awareness that a certain sequence of ' impressions and ideas ' is occur ring. Hume's candid confession that whenever he comes out of his study and mixes with his fellows he finds himself irresistibly compelled to believe with 'the vulgar ' is typical. You may say of his arguments the very thing he himself said of Berkeley's; if they 'admit of no answer ', they also ' produce no conviction '. Nor has the plain man's belief in ' transcendent ' objects with which he is in contact and of which he gets knowledge through the processes of experiencing, ever lacked the backing of metaphysicians. Not to mention the great philosophers of antiquity and of the Middle Ages, evenin Hume's own lifetime, his younger contemporary Reid hadstruck at the root of his rejection of Transcendence by his correct contention that Hume's whole argument turns on a confusion between two very different things, the sensation, which is an event in my own private ' mental ' life, and the perception conveyed to me through the sensation, which is not a 'mental event' at all. (E.g. when the traffic lights change from red to green, I am made aware of the change by a sensa tion which is a private occurrence in my own mental life, but this sensation is not the change from red to green, it is the seeing of the change. That change itself would equally be taking place if I happened to be stone-blind. The whole importance of the sensation to me is precisely that it does thus yield me knowledge which 'transcends' awareness of its own occurrence.) Reid further goes on to show that unless this were true, there could be neither memory of my own past, nor historical knowledge, nor science. Hume himself has, at every turn in his reasoning, to assume that when I have what he calls an ' idea ', I recognize it as the ' idea ' of a certain past impression. The ' idea ' thus testifies, as on Hume's principles it could not possibly do, to an existence beyond its own, the former existence of an 'impression' which is no longer present. Without ' transcendence ' of some kind, there can be no knowledge by experience whatsoever, and if there is 'transcendence' of any kind, there is an end of thorough-going Phenomenalism. Miss Emmet nowhere mentions the name of Reid, and I fancy she is not very well acquainted with his writings. This is of little moment, as her special purpose is to deal not with Hume, but with more recent</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 121 representatives of Immanentism, Logical Positivists, and exponents of the Gestalt psychology. As against the Logical Positiviste, I think, if I may venture to say so, that she is particularly happy in her comments on their language about verification. It is on the plea that assertions which cannot be verified may be dismissed as unmeaning noises that some of them dismiss all theological, and others all ethical, propositions as meaningless verbiage. The implication seems to be that the verification of my statements is a process which involves no sort of ' transcendence ' of experience, considered as a mere string of ' priva.... ' experiences. This, as Miss Emmet points out, is a complete travesty of the process of scientific verification. When the results of A are ' verified ' by the observations of B, made at a later date, and perhaps in another conti nent, the getting of A's results is an experience of A, not of B, the making of B's observations an experience of B, not of A ; there is no experience to which both processes belong. Verification, as under stood in science, is a ' communal affair'; it is a mere unessential accident that the enunciation of the original results and the verifying should be experienced by the same subject. Not to mention that even when A verifies his own results, there is always the awkward question how, on a purely Immanentist theory, a past event can ever be verified. 'Experimental verification in the physical sciences is not merely a matter· of recording sense-impressions; it is a matter of devising techniques by means of which the requisite sense-impressions may be obtained. So verification by the senses in any exact science depends on a state of relationship in which the observer stands to a number of other processes and other people ' (p. 94 sq.). Miss Emmet is also, I think, particularly happy in her criticism of the last refuge of the doctrine of 'representative perception', the theory that the possibility of getting knowledge of the external world through perception is explained by some sort of structural identity of form between (a) events in the 'outside' world, (b) physiological processes in the nervous system, (c) 'mental events in consciousness'. As she says, even if we can contrive to understand what such a structural identity of form could mean as between (a) and (b), it is hard to see how it could exist between either (a) or (b) and (c). A sound theory of sense-perception will be a realist one, but it cannot conceivably be a ' copy ' theory. If all our knowledge comes to us primarily through experience and yet is knowledge of objects that transcend the process of experience itself then experience is throughout, to use a term borrowed by Miss Emmet from Whitehead, bi-polar. It is rooted in human reactions to the situations in which we are placed, and these reactions are always tinged with characteristic human emotionality, yet they also yield knowledge of a real world which includes the sub-human and may</page><page sequence="4">1.22 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES equally well include the superhuman. Our problem is to know just what, in our experience as it comes to us, belongs to the subjective and human pole, and what to the objective. Not only our religion, but our science, morality, art, even our everyday ' common-sense ' atti tude to men and things have the metaphysical character of an attempt to reach a transcendent object through specifically human experiences, —' anthropomorphism ' besets them all ; in all we are faced with the problem of the legitimacy of analogy, which is raised in a peculiarly acute form in the Thomist insistence on the ' analogical ' character of our knowledge of God. (Think of the manifest anthropomorphism of all attempts in literature to depict the life of the animals, trees, flowers, and again of the way in which we unavoidably use language about stresses, strains, attractions, repulsions, and the like in our very natural science itself.) In all these cases we are met by the same difficulty, that of saying what, if any, positive contribution is made to our knowledge of the objects by analogies confessedly drawn from the relations of human beings to other human beings and to the ' things ' around them. But in theology the task becomes exceptionally difficult, because these analo gies are used here as a basis for assertions about further relations not of persons and things to one another, but of the whole complex of the 'creatures' to a transcendent source of being beyond itself. The diffi culties to be encountered are fairly and fully set out and ably discussed in the chapters in which Miss Emmet considers the nature of Faith, the recently revived advocacy of a 'blind', non-rational faith as the only 'organ' of a genuine apprehension of God, and the great Thomist conception of the ' Analogy of Being '. I only wish space would permit me to try to do something like justice to the acuteness and sound judgement of these delightful chapters, but alas, it does not; I can only promise any readers of these lines great profit if they will study Miss Emmet's pages for themselves, and particularly if they will ponder well what she writes on a most important topic which has not yet received the full attention it deserves from theologians and meta physicians—I mean the distinction between more and less important analogies and our means of discerning which of them are of capital importance for the theologian's purpose. It is instructive to find that, with all her appreciation of the great constructive achievement of Thomism, she shares the view of Dr. E. R. Bevan and not a few other contemporary philosophers that ' analogy ', by itself, without some sort of non-analogical supplementation is not a sufficiently firm basis for a genuine apprehension of God by ' natural reason '. (For, I take it, we have to get outside analogy itself, if we are to have a criterion for the selection of the analogies which should be of dominant importance.)
