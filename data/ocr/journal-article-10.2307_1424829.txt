<plain_text><page sequence="1">Experiential Context of the Aesthetic Process U James Marston Fitch is currently the director of Historic Preservation with Beyer Blinder Belle, Architects and Planners of New York City. He is also Professor Emer- itus of architecture at Columbia University where he began teaching in 1954. He holds honorary degrees from several academic institutions and is the recipient of numer- ous awards in architectural scholarship and preservation, including a Distin- guished Professor award from the ASCA in 1986. He is the author of numerous arti- cles and several books, among these are Walter Gropius, Architecture and Esthet- ics of Plenty, American Building: The Environmental Forces That Shape It (2 volumes) and Historic Preservation. My fundamental thesis is that the ulti- mate task of architecture is to act in favor of humankind: to interpose itself between us and the natural environment in which we find ourselves, in such a way as to remove the gross environmental load from our shoulders. The central function of architecture is thus to lighten the very stress of life. Its purpose is to maximize our capacities by permitting us to focus our limited energies upon those tasks and activities which are the essence of the human experience. This successful interposition between humanity and its natural environment furnishes the material basis of all great architecture. To wrest the objective con- ditions for optimal development and well- being from a Nature which only seldom provides it, to satisfy our physiological and psychological requirements at opti- mal levels-this beyond question is the objective basis of any architecture which is both beautiful and good. To design such a building, as Gropius once so movingly put it, is an authentic act of love. Introduction It goes without saying that all architects aspire to the creation of beautiful build- ings. But a fundamental weakness in most discussions of architectural aesthetics is a failure to relate it to its matrix of exper- iential reality. Our whole literature suf- fers from this conceptual limitation since it tends to divorce the aesthetic process from the rest of experience, as though it were an abstract problem in pure logic. Thus we persist in discussing buildings as though their aesthetic impact upon us were an exclusively visual phenomenon. And this leads immediately to serious misconceptions as to the actual relation- ship between the building and its human occupants. Our very terminology reveals this misapprehension: we speak of hav- ing seen such and such a building, of liking or not liking its looks, of its seem- ing too large or too small in scale, etc., etc. These are all useful terms, of course, insofar as they convey a part of the whole truth about our relationship to our build- ings. But they are also extremely mis- leading in suggesting that humanity exists in some dimension quite separate and apart from its buildings; that its only relationship with them is one of passive exposure; that this exposure occurs only along the narrow channel of vision; and that the whole experience is quite unaf- fected by the environment in which it occurs. The facts are quite otherwise and our modes of thought must be revised to cor- respond to them. For architecture-like humanity-is totally submerged in the natural external environment. It can never be felt, perceived, experienced, in any- thing less than multidimensional totality. A change in one aspect or quality of this environment inevitably affects our per- ception of and response to all the rest. Recognition of this fact is crucial for aes- thetic theory, above all for architectural aesthetics. Far from being narrowly based upon any single sense of percep- tion like vision, our response to a build- ing derives from our body's total response to and perception of the environmental conditions which that bulding affords. It is literally impossible to experience architecture in any "simpler" way. In architecture there are no spectators: there are only protagonists, participants. The body of critical literature which pretends otherwise is based upon photographs of buildings and not the experience of the actual buildings at all. (It seldom occurs to us to remember that even when we study the pictures of one building in a book or magazine, we always do so while sheltered by another. We could no more enjoy photographs of a beautiful build- ing while seated in a snow-filled meadow than we could respond favorably to a concert in a storm-tossed lifeboat at sea. Most such aesthetic experiences sub- sume as sine qua non the controlled environment of architecture.) Analogies between architecture and the other forms of art are very common in aesthetic literature. Obviously, architec- ture does share many formal character- istics with them. Like a painting or sculp- ture, like a ballet or a symphony, a building may be analyzed from the point of view of proportion, balance, rhythm, color, texture and so on. But such anal- ogies will be misleading unless we con- stantly bear in mind that our experiential relationship with architecture is funda- mentally of a different order from that of the other arts. With architecture, we are submerged in the experience, whereas the relationship between us and a painting or a symphony is much more one of simple exposure. Leonardo da Vinci claimed for painting a great advantage over the other forms of art-namely, that the painter had the unique power of fixing, once and for all, not only the vantage point from which his painting was to be viewed but also the internal environment (illumination, atmospheric effects, spatial organiza- tion) under which the painted action took place. Such a claim is only partly true for any art form: for architecture it is preposterous. Nevertheless, architects since the Renaissance have accepted without challenge this proposition, thereby obscuring another fundamental difference between the experiencing of works of art and architecture. The first involves a unilinear exposure, a one- way and irreversible sequence of events, while with architecture the experience is polydirectional and random in both time and space.

If the situation were confined to a handful of critics and historians speaking only to each other, it might perhaps be written off as a small, if aberrant, development. But unfortunately this literature has a wide circulation and presitigious institutional backing and its negative impact is affecting both the practice and the teaching of architecture. The reasons for this qualitative decline are widespread and complex. Many of them no doubt reflect the deepening cri- sis of our culture as a whole. These may lie beyond our capacity to correct. But some of them are specific to the archi- tectural profession and therefore sub- ject to diagnosis and, one hopes, cor- rective therapy. One of the principal sources of this malaise in our literature is the recent infusion of two specialized areas of academic philosophy: pheno- menology and semiology. Simple dictio- nary definitions of these terms suggest that, whatever their utility for profes- sional philosophers, they are apt to prove dangerously counter-productive for architectural theorecticians. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines phenomenology thus: "the description of the formal structure of the objects of awareness, and of aware- ness itself, in abstraction from any claims concerning existence." The American Heritage Dictionary car- ries the definition a little further into metaphysics: "the study of all possible appearances in human experience, during which con- siderations of objective reality and purely subjective response are temporarily left out of account." Although the earlier (1947) Webster's Unabridged does not define phenomen- ology, it gives this definition of the phen- omenist as "one who believes only in what he observes in phenomena, having no regard to their causes or consequences; one who does not believe in a priori reasoning or necessary prime princi- ples; one who does not believe in an invariable connection between cause and effect, but holds this generally acknowl- edged relation to be nothing more than a habitually observed sequence." American Heritage defines semiology as "the science dealing with signs or sign language. The use of signs in signalling, as with a semaphore" while Webster's New Collegiate defines semiotics as "a general philosophical theory of signs and symbols that deals with their func- tion in both artificially constructed and natural (sic!) languages." But Webster's Unabridged has only this definition of semiotics (there is no entry for semiology): "semiotics-pertaining to the signs or symptoms of disease"! These definitions share certain charac- teristics. Those for semiotics imply that vision is the unique channel of sensory perception, ignoring the fact that most phenomena are experienced through most or all of the others-hearing, olfaction, taste, touch and propriocep- tion; and ignoring the fact that many phenomena-e.g., heat, gravity, the composition and movement of gases- are not visually perceptible at all. Defi- nitions of phenomenology-the field which furnishes the intellectual platform for the architectural semiotician-are more alarming still in their implications for architecture. We are told that "the formal structure of (architecture) can be described in abstraction from the claims of existence." Architectural appearance can thus be evaluated without regard to "objective reality or purely subjective response." The architectural semiolo- gist is at liberty to observe (architectural) phenomena, "having no regard for their causes or consequences." Indeed, he or she is freed from believing in "an invari- effect ... this generally acknowledged relation (is) nothing more than ... a habitually observed sequence." These are conceptual positions which, explicitly or implicitly, permeate the lit- erature of architectural semiologists- and, for that matter, that of the Post- Modernist critics as well. Are we to take this erudite literature literally? What would be the consequences if such a policy were actually applied to the design of structural members? Does the action of gravity on a roof truss or a column display "not an invariable connection between cause and effect ... but noth- ing more than ... a habitually observed sequence"? Is the "formal structure" of architectural space-classroom, the- ater, laboratory-to be evaluated by a process in which "considerations of objective reality and purely subjective responses are temporarily left out of account"? How can such an approach enable us to specify the air conditioning systems and thermal insulation required to make those spaces habitable? We should examine carefully the actual circumstances under which phenome- nologists and semiologists perform their work. The fact is that neither one deals with experiential reality at all. Instead, each employs words and pictures which purport to describe that reality. While both are essential to communication, both are grievously flawed-one-dimen- sional facsimiles which, unless we are careful, come to be accepted as substi- tutes for multidimensional reality itself. The satellite photograph of the sun, for example, will permit the astrophysicist to observe the solar flares on the sur- face. That observation, detached from "any claims concerning existence" (such as ambient temperatures of 10,000,000? F) does advance our understanding of the universe. But it should never be for- gotten, as it too often is, that the physi- cist's observation is strictly conditioned by the terrestrial temperatures under which it itself occurs. A mere 50? change above or below his laboratory's com- fortable 70? F would render accurate observations difficult: a 100? F shift would threaten life itself. In real life, there are Winter 1988 JAE 41/2</page><page sequence="3">U no circumstances, even "temporary," in which the context of the observation does not modify the observation itself. Dual Bases of Aesthetic Decision The study, criticism and appreciation of works of art occur in the context of two coexistent levels of experience-cul- tural and physical, cognitive and sen- suous. Thus, when we confront works of art in the museum, our final judgment on the event is the result of a reciprocal process. From the confrontation itself we acquire direct sensuous information by perceptual means-sight, sound, touch and smell. This input is continuously analyzed against a background of cog- nitive information on that art which we have acquired from our culture. The consequence of this aesthetic process is dialectical: cultural standards modify perception and perceptual input, in turn, modifies our aesthetic response. The end result of this process is a resolution of forces which are at once private and public, personal and societal, sensual and intellectual. But this process does not take place in a vacuum. It occurs, like life itself, under concrete sets of experiential conditions. Though nominally exogenous, these conditions inevitably modify our judg- mental processes. Thus, if the museum is too hot or too cold or too noisy, the aesthetic experience will be negatively affected, no matter what the "objective" value of the artwork may be. In addition, of course, a host of internal, endoge- nous forces are involved in the act of reaching aesthetic decisions. Among them are our physical condition (how tired we are, how much time we have for the viewing, whether we are hungry or thirsty, etc.) as well as our psychic state (whether we know that the art is already esteemed by our peers or as yet unknown to them, whether we view it alone or in company, etc.). This is the circumambient context of aes- thetic decision. And this is the context which is consistently minimized, if not altogether ignored, in the literature of aesthetics and art criticism. The initial error begins with the implicit assumption that, because perception of art is pri- marily visual, it is exclusively so. And this leads, even if unwittingly, to thinking of the enjoyment of art as a spectator sport. Like people at a tennis match, we are assumed to stand outside the field of action, our only channel of perception being visual. Such an oversimplification ignores the fact that the spectator is sub- merged in the same set of environmental forces as the art on view. The experience is a first-hand, face-to-face encounter between viewer and viewed, observer and observed, perceiver and perceived. There is no intermediary, no interpreter or interlocutor. At the same time, it is obviously true that our contact with the work of art remains highly tenuous, "disinterested and free" in Kant's defini- tion. When we find the painting or sculp- ture "bad" (i.e., aesthetically unsatis- factory) or when we "grow tired of look- ing at" even "good" art work, we can easily terminate the encounter simply by walking away from it. It is when we try to communicate the aesthetic experience vicariously-that is, by photographic images projected in the lecture hall or printed facsimiles in art journals-that we introduce a whole new set of complicating factors. Not only is the two-dimensional image substituted for the three-dimensional original. Even in purely perceptual terms, without the intervention of the interpreter, this shift is more radical than commonly realized. Vision, here the principal channel of perception, is compromised. The lumi- nous conditions under which the photo- graph was originally made (color and intensity of light, vantage point of cam- era, etc.) are imperfectly replicated by even the best photography and printing. And the visual environment depicted inside the image is now enframed in the radically different context of lecture hall or library. Words and Pictures- Necesscry But Hazardous And now the interlocutor (lecturer, author, critic) interposes himself between the viewer and the viewed: not only does he tell us where the object came from, who made it and why; he also tells us what we ought to think of it. The results of this intervention are literally incalculable. The pictorial information embodied in the artifact is now cocooned in the verbal web of spoken or printed word. The sen- suous data of visual perception is now supplemented by cognitive data. Nom- inally it aims to supplement: in reality it tends to supplant it, as the literature of semiotics all too convincingly suggests. Obviously, the cultural utility of spoken lecture and printed essay is not at issue here. It would, indeed, be hard to imag- ine the modern consciousness without their ubiquitious presence. What is at issue is that their profound influence on aesthetic theory goes largely unre- marked. Historically, the art lecture and the art book are very new to human cul- ture. Before printing and photography, aesthetic theory necessarily derived from first-hand contact between user and artifact, viewer and viewed. Early liter- ature-e.g., among the Greeks-might have been profound conceptually: but before the printing press, its propaga- tion was strictly limited in scope and audience. Architectural aesthetics necessarily dif- fers from that of painting and sculpture, of music, dance and theater in many fun- damental respects. Unlike the work of art, architecture is always basically functional and utilitarian, whatever its artistic pretensions. This may also apply to a wide range of other artifacts with both formal and functional properties- from Medieval armor to Minoan drink- ing cups. But our aesthetic experience with architecture is one of submergence rather than passive and contemplative exposure, as in the case of art. We inhabit the work of architecture; we merely per- ceive the work of art. To fail to under- stand the qualitative difference between these two aspects of experiential reality may have stultifying effects on the liter- ature of art criticism: on that of archi- tecture, they are nothing less than disastrous. The literature of architecture, both his- toriographical and critical, is today heavily dependent upon concepts and terminology borrowed from nearby (and putatively) congruent fields of theoreti- Winter 1988 JAE 41/2</page><page sequence="4">U cal activity. One phylum of borrowed aids is verbal/literary; the other picto- rial/aesthetic.1 It well may be that, in lieu of actually experiencing architecture, we have no choice but to employ these bor- rowed modes of description and anal- ysis. Indeed, actual exposure to archi- tecture as expressed in the cultural tour- ism of the past few decades, seems only to whet our appetites for more books on architectural history, criticism and travel. But there are conceptual hazards in the act of writing descriptions and critiques of architecture, just as there are in writ- ing verbal descriptions of such experi- ences as eating food, drinking wine, or listening to music. In all such cases, we are employing one-dimensional verbal means to describe four-dimensional, multisensory experience-experience of which the aesthetic is only one aspect and where, in any case, sensory percep- tion has sharp limitations (e.g., our inability to perceive botulism in contam- inated food or imminent structural fail- ure in the badly-welded roof truss). If architectural criticism must employ words and pictures to make its points, then it should employ rigorous and pre- cise standards, qualities sadly lacking in much of our current literature. Today, we find the critic saying of the architect that he or she uses "metaphors" to "express" an idea. That the architect employs this or that "grammar," "speaks" such and such "language" of design. Here the critic is describing visual phenomena in ver- bal/literary terms, attributing to the architect literary qualities which may or may not be implicit in this latter's work. These verbal referents are often hope- lessly mixed up with pictorial ones. With the flip of a wrist, the critic can convert any building into an "icon," a "symbol" or an "image." And sometimes the referents are aural: buildings are said to be giving us "signals" or, alterna- tively, sending us "messages." The most famous among such metaphors is Goethe's dictum: "architecture is frozen music." Clearly, architects have often used explicit referents in their work. Nineteenth-cen- tury historicizing eclecticism was a giant system of literary and pictorial allusion whose "message" could only be com- prehended by the literate. The Doric portico was used to suggest the calm, idealized beauty of Periclean democ- racy. The Gothic style could be used to invoke the virtues of upper class domes- tic life (in the country house), military prowess (in forts and arsenals), reli- gious piety (in churches and cemeteries). And in the twentieth century, the panelled ceilings of Wright's Prairie houses evoke the Japanese celebration of wooden joinery, just as LeCorbusier's use of pipe railings in the houses of the twenties constitutes a clear allusion to the ocean liners whose efficiency he so admired. But we do not have to hypothecate these referents from a study of engravings or old photographs. They are explicit, well- documented matters of historical rec- ord: no semiologist is required to inter- pret them. What Architecture "Communicates" and How Buildings can be said to "communicate" with their inhabitants in several distinct modes.2 Perhaps the most literal of these is the way in which buildings (or at least their enclosed volumes) communicate by their acoustical responses to the sounds which we produce in them. These sounds may be either deliberate (as in concerts, lectures, plays) or incidental by-prod- ucts of other activities (the noise of busi- ness machines in an office, children in a schoolroom corridor). In the first instance, the architect manipulates the volume, shape and surfaces of the containing vessel (classroom, theater, concert hall) to transmit the manufactured sound with maximum fidelity. In the second instance, the architect manipulates space and materials to mask or exclude sounds extraneous to the activity itself. But, in any case, it is not really productive to regard the vessel as being any more of an active communicator than the ampli- fier on a hi-fi set. Buildings employ accessory means of "communicating" with their users. Printed signs ("Exit," "Dade County Court House," "Ladies Room"). Dedicatory inscriptions ("here lies the body of . . .," "From this rostrum, on July 4,1776, spoke ..."). Inconographic symbols (crucifix, Star of David, hammer and sickle). In all these, the means of communication are exclusively visual. But thanks to elec- tronics (amplifiers, public address sys- tems, tapes and recordings) the building also "communicates" by auditory means (ringing bells to mark the end of classes; spoken announcements-"Will the party waiting for Mr. Smith please contact..."). It should be noted that all information so transmitted, whether visual or auditory, is cognitive, not sensuous. One can also say that, across time but strictly within a given culture, building types (Gothic church, porticoed state capitol, multistorey office building) do become metaphors of the institutions which they house, in much the same way that the seated Buddha or the Virgin and Child have become icons of their respective cults. But it ought never to be forgotten that icons qua icons have very specific and limited relevances. Except for those building types with explicitly ideological or liturgical functions (churches, tombs, memorials), the icon- ographic function ranks fairly low in order of architectural priorities. The semiologist, relying upon photo- graphs or other two-dimensional fac- similes of three-dimensional artifacts, constructs elaborate iconographic sys- tems, replete with "signals" of real or putative significance. But all too often these significances are inferred by the critic with little or no objective evidence that the architect consciously and delib- erately incorporated them in the design. Nor, in experiential reality, would the spectator be able to isolate the critic's "signals" from all the rich mix of sensuous information with which one is bom- barded when one confronts the actual building. The fact is that semiotics cannot deal with the four-dimensional sensuous reality of being actually submerged in architecture. For, under such circum- stances, the "signals" (if it can be correct so to describe the sensory stimuli of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch in such schematic terms) are far too complex to be isolated and evaluated by the Winter 1988 JAE 41/2</page><page sequence="5">observer. Though he or she seldom bothers to tell us so, the semiologist deals only with visually accessible information (photographs, diagrams and words) about the appearance of architecture, not at all with its performance as an instrument of environmental manipulation. It must always be remembered that the architectural critic, in preparing a cri- tique, is twice removed from sensory contact with the object of that criticism. 1) The critic may have actually visited the building under review, though often relies upon pictorial and textual mate- rials which are furnished by others. 2) The critic always produces an essay in controlled environmental condi- tions-usually not the one under discus- sion. This double separation in time and space isolates the critic from the full experiential impact of actually being an inhabitant of the building under review. Even more significantly, this isolation acts as a filter through which only visually accessible data are transmitted. This fil- tration introduces a profound visual bias into all aesthetic judgments. It can per- haps never be altogether eliminated; but it would be minimized if the critic aban- doned any conceptual stance as spec- tator and instead assumed that of par- ticipant. The suffocatingly superficial quality of most architectural criticism stems from the critic's unwillingness or inability to understand this, to compre- hend the basic fact that architecture is not like painting and sculpture which can only be experienced from the outside. Failing to understand the difference, the critic stands outside the building, figur- atively as well as literally. Most of his or her judgments will be based upon exter- nal appearances: interiors nearly always play a secondary role in the architec- tural critique. This means that what the building does for the passerby is implic- itly assumed to be more important than what it does for its inhabitants. This externalizing perspective is consoli- dated by the fact that most photographs will be daytime shots, if for no other rea- son than that the camera is a creature of light. Yet half of our experience with architecture around the year occurs in non-daylight hours. And most exterior views will be fair weather exposures, if for no other reason than that rain, sleet and snow complicate the work of the photographer. Yet few American cli- mates outside the Southwest afford the endless sunshine which architectural photography presumes. Thus, even in purely visual terms, the data which the photograph affords us is severly limited in both time and space. It may be an essential part of our apparatus of com- munication, but we overlook its insuper- able limitations only at great risk. Art Historian as Critic: Prisoner of the Pictorial The critic with a background in art his- tory approaches architecture from yet another conceptual posture. He or she is trained in the analysis of the formal properties of art works and in the his- torical process of their evolution across time; taught to look only at the outside of the work because, in a very real sense, the visually accessible surface is all there is to art. In painting and sculpture, form and function are one and the same. There is nothing but the surface (and in sculp- ture, of course, the volumes which that surface defines). The cultural function of this surface is to furnish the sensuous basis by which the work pleases, stim- ulates, informs, exhorts its viewers. Nothing happens inside the work which requires explication-not even the forces which hold it up, hold it together, hold it in shape across time. The fabrication of an oil painting, stone carving, metal casting, serigraph, demands of the artist a working knowledge of complex phys- ical forces. But no comparable hands- on experience with fabrication pro- cesses is expected of the art historian. This separation of artistic practice from aesthetic theory is strikingly evident in typical art historical curricula, where the distinction between art history and stu- dio art is rigorously enforced. The young historian is not only not encouraged to learn something of the metiers of the objects he or she will analyze but is actively discouraged from doing so. Only the art conservator is visualized as inter- vening in the life history of the artifact: and this person is normally trained on another and "lower" academic tract. Given this training, the typical art-his- torian-turned-architectural critic does what he or she is trained to do: analyzes pictures of buildings in exactly the same way as he or she does paintings them- selves. This critic accepts the photo- graph of the building as a satisfactory surrogate for the four-dimensional experience of the building itself. And here we confront a crucially important diver- gence in critical method. A good color photograph of a painting, taken from the very viewpoint assumed by the painter (i.e., a few points along an axis vertical to the center of the picture plane) does in fact afford an acceptable stand-in for the painting itself, being a two-dimen- sional facsimile of a two-dimensional original. There is actually only this locus in space from which the painting can be satisfactorily perceived. This Leonardian fix in time-space is a great convenience for the art critic, whose whole critical apparatus is based upon it. But, unfortunately, it cannot be trans- ferred to architecture without hazards, for there are thousands of points in time- space from which buildings are com- monly observed. When the critic selects- as he or she is compelled to select-a few visual vantage points, he or she risks the commitment conceptually to a tunnel view of the experiential reality of the building.3 And this is by no means the only conse- quence of the critic's commitment. He or she should remember that the volumes delineated in his or her selected photo- graphs are not of empty forms but of inhabited spaces. This fact will have influenced every aesthetic decision made by the architect while manipulating the visually accessible surfaces of his or her building. How well the architect recon- ciles the demands of form and function will be a measure of his or her talent; but even the most capricious of archi- tects cannot have wholly ignored the needs of the clients. Nor can they be ignored by the critic in evaluating the architect's accomplishment. Winter 1988 JAE 41/2</page><page sequence="6">U Most critical literature overlooks this crucial consideration; and modern architectural photography makes it all too easy, since it very seldom records actual inhabitants going about their mundane affairs. The reasons for this omission may be innocent enough. Any motion in the field of view is the enemy of the time exposure. So an architectural photograph without people-like the aforementioned photography without bad weather or darkness-is an easy way out for the photographer and, by extension, for the critic. But the cumula- tive impact of such documentation upon our conceptual construction of the built world is hallucinatory: empty streets, empty portals, empty rooms, all with the enamelled polychromy of a cityscape by DiChirico. Architecture today needs historians, theoreticians and critics who view it from a conceptual position inside the field.4 It desperately needs persons who under- stand that, far from being a spectator sport, architecture is our prime instru- ment of environmental control; that its current inadequacies can only be cor- rected by a factual analysis of its per- formance and not by mere cosmetic manipulation of its appearance. How these spokespeople are trained, what academic degrees they hold, is of sec- ondary importance. One thing is appar- ent, however: formal problems cannot be fruitfully discussed without a clear understanding of the functional necess- ities which underlie them. To deny this umbilical connection is to drive our crit- ical literature further into the metaphys- ical slough which threatens to engulf it. Notes 1 There is, of course, a third phylum of architecturol theory which deals with the science and technology of building design, construction and performance. But this vast litera- ture apparently does not qualify for academic attention. It is completely ignored by (may indeed be completely unknown to) the critics of the establishment. 2 To conceive of buildings as "communicating" is, of course, anthropomorphic: it probably produces more confusion at one level of understanding than clarification at another. For, whether the message (or signal, as the semioticians put it) is implicit or explicit, active or passive, objectively present or subjectively read into the experience by the observer, it is ultimately the client who, through the architect, is speak- ing-not the building itself. 3 C.f. "classic" view of Venturi's Philadelphia home for the aged; down-stream view of FLW's Falling Water; meadow view of Corbu's house for Swiss students at University of Paris. 4 Except for the professional journals-Architectural Record, Architecture, Inland Architect and Progressive Architec- ture-criticism is almost wholly in the hands of writers who lack formal academic training for professional status in the field. Among the nation's leading newspapers and weekly journals only two-Connoisseur and The Village Voice- have regular critics who are licensed architects: Walter McQuade and Michael Sorkin. It is difficult to imagine a comparable situation in other professional areas-e.g., law, medicine, engineering, horticulture, dentistry, or for that matter, art history itself.
