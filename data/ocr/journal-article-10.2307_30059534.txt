<plain_text><page sequence="1">Derek Mahon: A Commitment to Change JOHN BYRNE In his introduction to the Sphere Book of Modern Poetry,' Mahon reveals his own poetic predilections while indicating the major landmarks on the map of modern Irish verse. Mahon swears fealty to the "Master" (referring thus to Yeats with no little irony and one suspects that a healthy specticism is employed to reduce the Yeatsian phenomenon to human proportions). The influence of the Yeatsian court, however, on lesser contemporary poets encouraged a smugness and naivete, issuing a willingness to "accept without demur snug velleities bequeathed to them by the nineteenth century'12 The partiality of this remark suggests Mahon's view of poetry. He goes on to criticise these poets (James Stephens, Padraic Colum, F.R. Higgins), obliquely revealing his own conception of what should be the concerns of poetry: "Their assumptions and credulities were those of the Irish country people of the time: and the Irish, for many years, returned the poets' reverence with reverence for a poetry which evaded the metaphysical unease in which all poetry of lasting value has its source."3 In his own work, Mahon eschews complacency, showing a readiness to confront in himself the "metaphysical unease" with which modern man and his literature are afflicted. From the "snug velleities" of the Twilight acolytes we must leap forward a generation to encounter the lasting influences on Mahon. At such a remove the regenerative themes of the Revival could be purged of its attendant rabid patriotism. Mahon clearly posits his affinity with the demystifying processes instigated in their different ways by Kavanagh and Clarke. One would be unwise however to ignore (initially, perhaps, an understandable temptation) the influence on the poet of the cultured styles and paradoxically modern themes of eighteenth century Gaelic poetry. Referring to the generation of poets starting to write in the 'thirties and 'forties, Mahon comments: "It was lett to later generations to extend (with the irony, sexuality and knowledge of despair which were properties of the old Gaelic poetry) the repertory of themes the Revival had introduced".4 One can readily discover in Mahon's work the "risus purus" characteristic of a good deal of eighteenth century Gaelic verse (and again, paradoxically, characteristic of so much modernist poetry). Mahon points out that this trend towards ventilating and demystifying poetry did not lay bare a course texture but rather identified what Nabokov has called "that real sense of beauty which has far less to do with art than with the constant readiness to discern the halo round a frying pan". Mahon is responsive to the imaginative potential in the ordinary and concrete. He is otten close to Kavanagh in what Seamus Deane has described as the latter's "fidelity to the miracle of the actual''5 Although one would prefer to think of Mahon in more secular terms, there is in his poetry a potential for transcendence inactual objects and in the physical landscape. Mahon is clearly closer to Louis MacNeice than to any of the poets mentioned above. For a long time shunned by the Irish literary world, MacNeice has been welcomed back into the fold with a good deal of enthusiasm (and, often, hypocrisy). His bitter experience of the Northern Irish Protestants' cultural dilemma, his sense of discontinuity and dissociation from the urban community in which he lived, his sustaining, desperate and comic irony and delight in the importance of the actual world around him, all mark him as the most significant and lasting influence on Mahon ("In Carrowdore Churchyard", dedicated to MacNeice, is a fine achievement and a decorous elegy to the poet). MacNiece's struggle to clarify his view of society (both English and Irish) and to come to terms with his Irishness is, in many important ways, Mahon's struggle. Influence in itself, of course, has no virtue. It may facilitiate or restrict. Mahon's assimilation of influences suggests an awareness of tradition, of poetic forbears asserting "their immortality most vigorously". Although not wary of varying technique, Mahon has never felt compelled to move towards new forms (as has Ted Hughes, for instance) to avoid constricting echoes. Instead, he consorts openly with kindred spirits. In The Snow Party Mahon speaks with a unique voice which has been nurtured on the various literary models immediately available to the contemporary Irish or British poet. He refuses to be tied down, wriggling free of any felicitous 62</page><page sequence="2">categorisation. Edna Longley has made the point: "Although his technique has been assisted by various influences (Baudelaire, Graves, MacNeice, Dylan Thomas) Mahon's roots are unwillingly in Ulster ...". He is among the least provincial (in its perjorative sense) of Irish poets. The comparison with Heaney is clear. Mahon is from a Protestant urban background, Heaney from a close-knit Catholic rural community. Whereas Heaney has staked out the boundaries of his poetic, devoting himself (thus far, at least) to even deeper excavations into his chosen land; Mahon careers through city streets, registering in photographic images the phenomena of industrialised urban life. His temperament and sensibility are drawn more to the prefabricated, technological myths of western urbanised man than to established organic myths. His poems are vital, often there is a sense of setting unknown forces into motion. There are ideas and a delight in philosophical speculation but rarely are they drained of the colour injected by impressive and often daredevil images. There is a circling in his poems of what concerns him most. This is not to suggest that Mahon dodges issues; rather does he try out fresh relationships, hoping for that imaginative spark coming from contact between ordinary yet surprisingly unconnected objects and ideas. Irony may spar playfully with a romantic self-dramatisation or intensify the mood into grim comedy. Seamus Deane has described an important feature of Mahon's poetry as follows: "Mahon is evasive, not because he avoids feelings, but because he passes through them quickly. However saturated he may be in them, he is careful that whatever tear is squeezed out in a poem will have a deprecatory highlight glistening within it. He goes into dangerous areas, but in a fast car, not on foot."6 It is precisely this self-conscious, circumspect quality that gives Mahon's poems a tantalising effect. There is much irony in the poems but it is far from being arbitrary or obscure. Mahon does not try to plunge us into a modernist nightmare of wildly shifting perspectives, or unnerving time warps. His sense of incongruity is more often rooted in an observable world in the manner of MacNeice (or, often, J.G. Farrell) than honed down to Beckett's metaphysical paradoxes. He is, however, capable of both styles. Indeed, the two modes often coalesce. Notice the strong Beckettian resonance in lines like "Inventing names for things/To propitiate silence" and "Our speechless debarkations/Without zest or issue", co-existing with a concluding bathos evocative of MacNeice: And the pubs are shut There are no Buses till morning. Since Mahon "passes through" feelings quickly his poems may contain many degrees of feeling. At his best, he maintains a remarkable ambivalence with the potential meanginfulness of the poem refusing to be tied down to a specific meaning. This typical faculty for sustaining ambivalence is evident in a number of poems from The Snow Party which form a natural group. Here the poet is primarily interested in the relationship of the artist to his (changing, urgent, demanding) society. This is one (and to my mind the most rewarding) way of responding to the metaphorical potential ot these poems. Since Mahon is from a particular background and is writing at a particular time the political concerns of these poems will present themselves to the reader in a particular way. However, like all good poems they are metaphors for issues and conflicts fundamental to Man in society, as well as to a man in a society. The title poem of the volume, "The Snow Party" illustrates the sort of ambivalence I have in mind. Mahon narrates a simple story about the Japanese poet, Basho, attending a social function in the city of Nagoya. He tries to capture the formality and ritual of the imaged scene. What Mahon seems to be aiming at is a contemporary approximation to the spare imagistic verse and distinctive timbre of Basho. However, Mahon adapts the prototype on which his poem has been designed for particular personal ends. Each stanza constitutes a self-contained statement of fact; an additional piece of information. The three line stanza is often favoured by Mahon in longer poems ("Going Home", "The Last of the Fire Kings", "Thammuz", "Matthew v. 29-30"); yet this similarity highlights the difference between this poem and the others. In these other poems, Mahon usually opts for the loose, run-on line linking stanzas. In "The Snow Party", however, there is a more studied attempt to equate form and content. The structure of the poem is a vehicle for its thematic concerns. There is the sense of an undertow barely held in check by the formal constraints creating a tantalising effect. These constraints are strongest early on. As the poem gathers momentum it threatens to disregard 63</page><page sequence="3">Mahon's formal discipline. However, the final section reassures us that the poet has been in control all along, as the poem slows down to the same pace as in the first section. Occasionally, Mahon fails to keep his freewheeling verse in check and the poem can degenerate into a "prosaic tantrum".7 Here, however, , the possibility of disorder focuses attention on what we come to recognise as the rigid implementation of a subtle formal discipline contributing immeasurably to the poem's tonal ambivalence. The bare statements comprising the first three stanzas are one movement and one mood within the poem. The next four stanzas change back and prepare the ground for the crucial last stanza. The technique is cinematic. We zoom in to focus on the composed image of the snow party, then back away from the window of the house (as we, along with the guests, watch the snow falling) to take in the world beyond Nagoya: Snow is falling on Nagoya And farther south On the tiles of Kyoto. One almost imagines that the whole world is engaged in snow-watching. But not so: Elsewhere they are burning Witches and heretics In the boiling squares. (The translation effected by "Elsewhere" is reminiscent of the final stanza of Auden's "The Fall of Rome", beginning: "Altogether elsewhere ..."). This registers with considerable force. Until this point the restraint and poise of the verse has suggested and almost embodied certain social values. As the lines thaw we recognise that this society, represented by the party guests, has gradually evolved to a condition of stability and self-assurance. The reader enters an enclosed area of experience within the poem and within this remote, formal, exotic society. It is as though the falling snow (symbol of the refinement of social interaction and reflective of its pace) dulls the guests' receptivity to sensation. They cannot see through the white wall to the world beyond: the world, that is, beyond the poem. Yet they seem to exist in a special and unique time scale. This represents "the sense of pure existence, of being at its most hallowed and loveliest" that Douglas Dunn sees as a final attraction to Mahon (the sense of belonging is along the road towards this condition which is out of time). Mahon seems to be close to Octavio Paz who regards the poem as "a Fiesta, a precipitate of pure time".8 Mahon's view of the world is essentially poetic. The poem must transmute history ("every poem is an attempt to reconcile history and poetry for the benefit of poetry") in the same way as the poetic image transmutes language ("in transmuting language, the image not only opens the door to reality, it also, as it were, strips reality bare and shows it to us in its final unity").10 This fundamental ambivalence (fundamental to Mahon's view of the world) is sustained in "The Snow Party" by the tension generated between the "rational surface" and "more primitive levels in the mental hierarchy" remarked upon by Douglas Dunn. Mahon controls our shifting responses with great tact. There is no compelling urge to translate the poem's metaphors into socio-political terms; to tease out a meaning. The symbiosis of form and content moderates any such desire and strengthens the poem as a self-contained artifice. The spare details of: "There is a thinking of china/And tea into china" establish the tone of the snow party. The tinkling sound echoes throughout the poem (its sound ,accentuated by the snow) so that we respond to it retrospectively in different ways. There is a balance created here between delicacy and decadence. The atmosphere is precious, both in the affirmative and pejorative sense. On one hand, the snow forms a delicate filigree covering on the ground; on the other, it is an evanescent indulgent distraction from the pressing affairs of society, a cover-up. The reader falls into the party's rhythm. There is inevitably an identification of the reader (and, of course, the poet) with the guests since, by entering this special poetic world, he has established in himself the same sort of tensions existing in the poem between beauty and decadence, transcendence and empiricism. The tinkling of china is suggestive of a fragile lingering beauty which has lent a civilising influence to human intercourse. The party is highly civilised. It also suggests (in a surrealistic way, or, as in a dream) the crystalline beauty of the falling snow, as though the blanket distorts sound causing each flake to strike an affectingly beautiful note as it lands. However, the gestures of the party guests are "out of time". They are like the figures on Keats' "Grecian Urn", suspended in time and therefore immortal, yet static and unchangeable. Mahon is not presenting one side of the coin, then the other, and allowing the two to exert their repricocity on the reader. 64</page><page sequence="4">His presentation is always ambivalent, having the potential of slipping into a different attitude at any moment. Mahon complicates things with: Then everyone Crowds to the window To watch the falling snow. Had he wanted to affirm the gentility of the scene would he have chosen "crowds" which looks forward to: "Thousands have died since dawn ..."? There is clearly something unfitting about the guests pushing and jostling to watch the snow. This unease is confirmed later. As we move "further south" so does the poems balance change. Mahon balances the poem on a tight-rope in stanza five, a transitional point: Eastward, beyond Irago, It is falling Like leaves on the cold sea. The music of stanza two has become discordant. The "cold sea" causes a chill in the poem. Earlier there was the sense of each flake (delicate and deliquescent) interacting with the others to form a solid layer on the ground. There was a clear identification in the poet's mind between this encrustment and the society represented by those watching it. From one point of view, the society is civilised, an organism vitalised by the interaction of sensitive souls. Receptive to beauty, they enshrine its essence in their institutions and mores. The rituals of their social myth are like the accretions of snowflakes, substantial but divisible into component parts. If we feel compelled to hang a meaning on the poem, it must be that it is not the business of poetry (although the poem is concerned with the relationship of all art and artists to society, Basho was, after all a poet) to provide answers to society's questions. Mahon is not proposing that meaning is an impossibility in this world (despite his strong Beckettian sympathies) but that a poem must enter the world of public affairs tangentially and with circumspection. To borrow from Robert Frost, the poem, like a piece of ice "must ride on its own melting"; but the heat melting the ice must be the heat of human intercourse. Mahon tends toward the view that the raw material of poetry should come, whenever possible, from his own experience of how men relate to each other in his society. This, then, must pull against his yearning for temporal transcendence, suspended animation, "a palace of porcelain". One must agree, in this respect, with Edna Longley when she decides that Mahon "seems to suggest on balance that a poet whose art completely evaded the crisis of his countrymen and time might be a lesser poet". Indeed, Mahon has criticised poetry which turns a blind eye to actuality and change. There is, moreover, a strong sense of the democracy of phenomena in his work. In "After Nerval", we read: Your great mistake is to disregard the satire Bandied among the mute phenomena. He eschews anthropomorphism and pathetic fallacy including all phenomena as equally present and susceptible. Objects in Mahon's world radiate their own light. Nature is constantly in flux and: Already in a lost hub-cap is conceived The ideal society which will replace our own. The snow party guests try to force back the tide of change. Mahon introduces the external world of flux and change with the image of snow falling "like leaves on the cold sea". Leaves are used continually throughout Mahon's work as symbols of unfulfillment. In "Leaves", he writes: Somewhere there is an afterlife Of dead leaves. In the same poem, he likens the leaves to birds scratching at windows. They are, in a mystical sense, like the souls of the unfulfilled dead inhabiting the living world (one thinks of Dante's use of the same image in Inferno 1). In "The Snow Party", the leaves may be part of nature's bounty, but they are desolate and fated to be swept away on the "cold sea". They are symbols of evanescence and the inexorability of change. The description of the snow party has evoked a tapestry-like ornateness; gesture frozen in time and space. Elsewhere, in "the boiling squares", this suspended animation is of no consequence. At this point, he seems to imply that although the "barbarous kings" are wantonly destructive, they are, nonetheless, part of the momentum of change: they have energy. Once again, however, he side-steps the easy formula. While the changing tone suggests the bankruptcy of the snow party ethos, the restoration of order recalls its potential inherent virtues. The final stanza counterpoints these tensions consumately. There can be no doubt that ultimately in this poem Mahon tips 65</page><page sequence="5">the balance away from the ivory tower self- absorption of the snow party guests. Because its forms have become resistant to refinement and change the society is self-regarding and decadent. Yet one's final impression is that the subtlety of tone and formal appropriateness militate against any bare statement of meaning. The syntactical force of the accusing "but" in: But there is silence In the houses of Nagoya And the hills of Ise imposes itself forcibly and is impossible to argue away. However, the formality with which the place-names are re-introduced (it is almost incantatory) implicitly re-affirms the qualities of order and ritual. "The Snow Party", "Afterlives", "The Last of the Fire Kings" and "A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford" examine the poet's feelings about how he fits into society. Inevitably, they have the Troubles as a back-drop. They are all, however, about perennial human issues. One may read the relevance of the Troubles to these poems in terms of a satisfying and coherent metaphor. They are accomplished poems with more than localised socio-political significance. Indeed, as Heaney has recognised, one does not have to be political in subject to have political relevance. Mahon has similiarly argued that writing poems is political activity of the most fundamental kind. Battles have been fought and lost, but a war remains to be won. The war, I mean, is not, of course, between Protestant and Catholic but between the fluidity of a possible life (poetry is a great lubricant) and the rigor mortis of archaic postures, political and cultural. The poets themselves have taken no part in political events, but they have contributed to that possible life, or to the possibility of that possible life; for the act of writing is itself political in the fullest sense. A good poem is a paradigm of good politics - of people talking to each other, with honest subtlety, at a profound level.12 Evaluating one's place in society inevitably involves making judgements on the past. Mahon's past has not been stabilised by the anchor of inherited common values and traditions. Whereas poets like Seamus Heaney and John Montague seem to have felt no real discontinuity in this respect, Mahon is keenly aware of having inherited the modern, largely urban conditions of dissociation and alienation. In Ireland, of course, the sociological division of Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft has particular relevance for poetry. Douglas Dunn maintains that the idea of an organic community is a re-hash of the traditional opposition of inspirational Celt and utilitarian Anglo-Saxon. Whatever the causes of this division (and they are, of course, many and complex), Mahon is aware that he lacks the stability of a willingly embraced cultural past against which to test experiences. If he benefits from the technology of a modern Gesellschaft, he is also vulnerable to its well documented illnesses: cultural deprivation, dissocation of sensibility, suppression of desire and instincts, ennui and all the rest. Theoretically, this must mean that each experience must be evaluated anew, since there is no natural hegemony of experience. "Afterlives" sees Mahon returning from one city (London) to another (Belfast). There is a weariness in the poem as if he is depressed at the prospect of banging his head against the same old brick wall. There is none of the awe which accompanies Mahon's occasional jaunts into the countryside. On these occasions, he often seems excited and slightly threatened by something strange and mysterious (one thinks, for instance, of "Day trip to Donegal"). As he remarked in an interview published in Les Lettres nouvelles, the countryside lay beyond his experience as a child: "Elle me semblait tr6s mysterieuse, tout aussi mysttrieuse que le quartier catholique que je traversais le matin a bicyclette pour aller a l'ecole. C'etait quelque chose d'irr6el, que l'on traversait, et c'est tout".'3 Here he sounds like Alain-Fournier's wide-eyed and bemused Meaulnes. However, there is a little mystery and awe in these lines from "Afterlives": What middle-class cunts we are To imagine for one second That our privileged ideals Are divine wisdom ... As the poet looks out at the streets of London from his flat he recognises that this cosmopolitan city with its comparative freedom has a strong symbolic attraction for the liberal Ulster mind. London is "Rain-fresh in the morning light". The irony in the following lines is of scant comfort to the poet trying to acknowledge logic and prejudice: This is our element, the bright Reason on which we rely For the long-term solutions. London, and all it represents in the contemporary mythology of Ulster's Troubles, remains for some like a bright light shining through darkness. One clear attraction is its 66</page><page sequence="6">comparative peacefulness. For many, of course it represents an alien and hostile culture. There is still an attraction for them, it seems to me, but it is more complex. The final irony of this attraction for Mahon is that he regards all industrialised cities as hostile and threatening. The irony is particularly sharp for a Northnern Irish Protestant writer who has strong connections with London, Belfast and Dublin. On one hand, Mahon is sickened by the readiness with which the Ulster middle-class conscientiously imitates its English (and, at one remove, its American) counterpart. He is, moreover, quick to point out the different social circumstances prevalent in the North and South: To the extent that the Northern poet, surrounded as he is by the Greek gifts of modern industry and what Ferlinghetti called "the hollering monsters of the imagination of disaster", shares an ecology with the technological societies his rulers are so anxious to imitate, he must, to be true to his imagination, insist upon a different court of appeal from that which sits in the South.14 Mahon insists upon the isolation of the Northern Protestant artist who cannot easily assimilate into his poetry the traditional themes of Irish poetry because he has no empirical sympathy with them. He writes "out of a sense of the complex, aesthetically uninspiring tensions of Northern Protestant middle-class identity". One must acknowledge, moreover, that there is still little real desire in the South to put in the emotional hard work needed to gain an insight into the nature and motivation of Mahon's "tribe". He has written: The suburbs of Belfast have a peculiar relationship to the Irish cultural situation inasmuch as they're the final anathema for the traditional Irish imagination. A lot of people who are regarded as important in Irish poetry cannot accept that the Protestant suburbs in Belfast are part of Ireland, you know. At an aesthetic level they can't accept that.15 Disdain is hardly held in check here. Yet in "Afterlives" the irony is aimed at himself as an aware member of the liberal bourgeoisie: The orators yap, and guns Go off in a back street; But the faith does not die That in our time these things Will amaze the literate children In their non-sectarian schools And the dark places be Ablaze with love and poetry When the power of good prevails. Still, Mahon's willingness to stand in the line of fire smacks of self-indulgence, if not melodrama. His need to shoulder some responsibility reveals itself in the poem as an avoidance of any real responsibility. As Heaney puts it (referring to himself in "Exposure"). he is weighing "responsible tristia". Irony is used here not to lay bare by the perception of false- seeming but to cover up by causing the self- satisified thrill which follows mild self laceration. The anger, though, is real enough; but one feels that he is spitting into the face of a wind. The emotional intensity is not achieved within the poem: he is attitudinising. After this fit of pique, the poem gets back on an even keel and Mahon regains his sustaining and characteristic ambivalence towards his subject. The pigeons on the roofs of "rain- fresh" London are replaced by a gull dreaming at the masthead as the poet returns home by sea "For the first time in years". His poetry, incidentally, proliferates in bird imagery. Here he is one of the wild geese returning home in circumstances far from heroic. He identifies with the dreaming gull (another self-critical pun?) as he orders his thoughts, sifting memories. This may be Mahon's equivalent of Coleridge's albatross (bearing in mind his guilty outburst). There is always a degree of self- reproach for the returning exile; all the more so if his country has been undergoing a great upheavel in his absence. The deceptive tranquility of the early lines of "Afterlives" dissolves into a new raw vulnerability. The description is emotionally and naturalistically precise ("trembles" and "shuddering" mimic the motion of the boat and the enervating, jarring impact on the poet of the boat's movement and of the prospect of being home again). It is as though Mahon, as well as the boat, were turning "In a wide arc to back" reluctantly up the lough. The reality greeting him is "grey" and chilling; a mixture of the brightness of London (there has been consistent punning on "light" and "element") and the darkness of his flat (he has to draw the curtains to allow London into his flat) and the boat-deck. The colour dualism of London and the sea is merged into the indeterminate greyness of Belfast. "Lightship" and "buoy" ironically remind us that this is Mahon's home, the place where he grew up, and imply that he is drawn to this place ineluctably. Ironically, the 67</page><page sequence="7">lightship beckons to him to return to grey Belfast from bright London. As in many other poems, Mahon is conveying his emotional state through the indeterminate oppressiveness of the physical landscape. Elsewhere, landscapes are reduced to waste ("Thammuz" in particular), speech reduced to silence ("Going Home" is one example from many in The Snow Party) and colour becomes monochrome. This points to the insistent tension in Mahon's work, generally, between the colourful observable world of ordinary life and the interiorised landscape which is characteristically oppressive and neutral. Wylie Sypher has maintained that the neutralisation of colour in modernist literature and painting tends to deny or, at least, phase out the objectivity of time and space in a manner similar to "brutal" painting. Mahon's exemplar in this respect, however, is more likely Samuel Beckett. In other poems, he is much closer to MacNeice in his delight in the surface glitter of industrialised society. In "Afterlives", though, there is a grim reduction. The appearance of his native city provides him with an objective correlative for his emotions. Some things, evidently, do not change: But the hills are still the same Grey-blue above Belfast. Mahon is after the impression of changes taking place within ultimately unchanging moulds. There is no comfort for him in the familiar hills brooding over the city. They reaffirm for him the ambivalence of his attitude towards his home and past. Even though he is estranged from Belfast, not having experienced the changes at first-hand, his identity is inevitably bound up wiht the enduring character of the place. The poem's ambivalence is confirmed in the final lines. Earlier, Mahon has acknowledged that for all his "privileged ideals", part of him is with "the dim/Forms that kneel at noon/In the city". In so doing, he has shown his awareness that he is not free of the blind acceptance of tribal myths and superstitions common among his people. This is a self- awareness binding him to the continuum of his country's history. In the last four lines he tries to convince himself that he has lost, in exile, all sense of belonging: Perhaps if I'd stayed behind And lived it bomb by bomb I might have grown up at last And learned what is meant by home. One way of approaching what Mahon is after in this poem, is via some remarks made by Edna Longley. Discussing Mahon's response to this question of the poet's responsibility to acknowledge social change, she writes: "Mahon's various "scruples" in fact point to the many fine discriminations the imagination needs to make, lest involvement become exploitation (of and by the poet), self-assertion escapism, reticence indifference, or pity sentimentality".'6 In both "the Snow Party" and "Afterlives" Edna Longey's "fine discriminations" are applicable. One might say that "The Snow Party" is concerned with the tension between reticence and indifference. One cannot pontificate about what should or should not concern poetry. However, Mahon's point in "The Snow Party" is that a civilisation may become decadent (static) through a lack of self- scrutiny (dynamic). Underyling "Afterlives" is the tension between involvement and exploitation (of and by the poet). In this case, Mahon's ambivalence is threatened by the self-indulgence of the last four lines. In everyday life, a comment along the lines of "perhaps I should have stayed at home and done my best to contribute, even though it may have amounted to nothing" is a perfectly normal and understandable way of keeping one's motives under review while not criticising oneself too fiercely. Mahon's conclusion, however, is facile and totally upsets the poise of what preceeds it. The poem moves between two poles: at one, he responsibly examines his involvement in society, while at the other, he opts for an easy self-irony (exploitation by the poet). Mahon's romantic urge to self-dramatise is evident in "The Last of the Fire Kings". The monarch dreams of being an adventurer, one who dramatically leaps at night from a moving train And strikes out over the fields Where fireflies glow Not knowing a word of the language. As elsewhere in his poetry, fire has a symbolic significance for Mahon here. It represents one pole of the poem's symbolic world. The other pole is represented by "A palace of porcelain". This is clearly a similar metaphoric cluster to that of "The Snow Party". The Fire-King is an exceptional man. In "The Last of the Fire Kings", fire symbolises political involvement (or, at least some form of direct involvement in the affairs of society). It suggests "a world of/Sirens, bin-lids/And bricked-up windows -". When our action man "strikes out over the fields" it is significant that "fireflies glow" 68</page><page sequence="8">(notice the daring pun on "strikes"). However, the Fire-King's ideal alternative is imagined as "Not knowing a word of the language". He would move through the hurly-burly of the market-place unobstructed. Unable to communicate, he would be detached, an accepted observed. Whichever fantasy is the most attractive to the Fire-King, he is certain that he will commit suicide "rather than perpetuate/The barbarous cycle". What is the "barbarous cycle"? One recalls "The Snow Party": Thousands have died since dawn In the service Of barbarous kings - (The opening lines of "After Cavafy" are "It is night/And the barbarians have not come"). It is obviously a temptation to think of the cyclical recurrences of violence throughout Irish history. But it seems likely that Mahon also envisages his Fire-King as a Promethean figure whose altruistic intentions back-fire. Prometheus' theft of fire was meant to comfort mankind and bring civilisation to a barbarous world. It became, of course, both an aid to man's development and a means ot wholesale destruction. Mahon exploits these duel potentialities of fire in this poem. The Fire- King is synonymous with the Poet-King, the "unacknowledged legislator" (although in this case the acknowledgement is all too evident) who brings to mankind not fire but the Word. He has the power to release his people "From the ancient curse", but it is rather in the role of destroyer that he has ruled, urged on by the people: Either way, I am Through with history - Who lives by the sword Dies by the sword. It is clear that Mahon maintains his characteristic ambivalence towards his subject. The reverie of the early stanzas gives way to self-assertion (bravado?). The Poet-Fire-King is spitting into the face of a decadent tradition, resolved to give up his life rather than prostitute himself any longer. The phrase "die by my own hand" conjures an image of a Roman emperor preparing to die in high fashion. The implied tension between the civilisation and decadence of Roman society is not gratuitous but is reinforced later in the poem. The Fire-King has been "perfecting" his ... cold dream Of a place out of time, A palace of porcelain Where the frugivorous Inheritors recline In their rich faorics Far from the sea. These lines are clearly suggestive of the poem's ambivalence. The dream has been ideal, perfect and cold. In other words, the Poet-Fire-King has dreamed of his creations being beautiful, delicate jewel-like things, occupying space but transcending time ("a palace of procelain" recalls the image of "tinkling china" in "The Snow Party"). The insistence is upon the world as art; nature as the hand-maiden of art. In "The Snow Party", inherent or potential decadence is strikingly pointed by the lines: But there is silence In the houses of Nagoya And the hills of Ise. In "The Last of the Fire Kings", decadence is suggested by the image of the frugivorous inheritors (privileged and irresponsible) reclining in their rich fabrics ("frugivorous" reinforcing the image of well-to-do reclining Romans indolently munching grapes between bouts of Bacchanalian frenzy). Privilege and irresponsibility are weighed in the scales with aesthetic beauty. Both are "out of time" in different ways. The "palace of porcelain" (again one thinks of Keats' "Grecian Urn") transcends contingencies, achieving immorality through the triumph of art over time. Yet it is self-regarding, an aesthetic closed-system with no access to the historically conditioned lives of men and women. It is "Far from the sea". The sea is a source of powerful and paradoxical impulses for Mahon. It is an image of the relentlessness of change, eroding inexorably (see, for example, "Heraclitus on Rivers"). Despite our knowledge that all things are in flux, the sea appears to our minds, geared as they most often are, to the tempo of daily living, as a permanent form. Once again, the poem hinges on a "but": But the fire-loving People, rightly perhaps, Will not countenance this, "The fire-loving people" recalls "the boiling squares" in "The Snow Party". In this instance, detachment is attractive but impossible. Just as the violence of "Elsewhere" in "The Snow Party" seems to be drawing even nearer to the silent houses of Nagoya, there is an inevitability about the influence of the "fire- loving people" on the Poet-King. 69</page><page sequence="9">"Fire-loving", of course, evokes the primitive Northern Irish attraction towards bonfires and the more sinister uses of fire. Substance is added to the implicit criticism of "a place out of time" by the slightly surprising "rightly perhaps" of stanza twelve (again Mahon uses the equivocal "perhaps": regarded by Beckett as the most important word in his language). In so doing, he adjusts the poem's balance to accommodate the last two stanzas. Mahon's images locate the poem in a recognisably Northern Irish context: "sirens", "bin-lids" (particularly localised) and "bricked-up windows" (more physical and vividly appropriate than the original line: "And concensus politics"). In the last stanza, the alternative to pandering to the whims of the populace is no longer tainted by the suggestion of decadence or self-indulgence. Indeed, the Poet-King is now seen as the possessor of great powers. He can, after all, release the populace from the "ancient curse". yet he is left with the consequence of serving his people: "to die their creature and be thankful". Mahon fantasises about the appeal of disengaging himself from his own and his country's past, from the "barbaric cycle". His involvement is such, however, that the only way out is through death. In terms of the poem's metaphors, to die would be to stop writing. If the choice lies between cataloguing events blow by blow (he rather self-indulgently suggests that this may, after all, be the only valid form of writing) and not writing at all, then ultimately the latter holds the greater attraction. The balance is heavily tilted in the last stanza, however, toward a conception of poetry as magical and efficacious. The poet is a shaman. Unfortunately, a shaman is impeded in his efforts to tend to the spiritual maladies of his people by the people themselves. He must address himself, instead, to the restricting round of petty illnesses, treating the obvious symptoms but ignoring the cancer. One could say that there is a central opposition in many of Mahon's poems between the exceptional (detached, egocentric, creative) and the average (serving largely to dramatise the exceptional). Mahon is attracted by the eccentric and the distorted. He often ironically refers to a future "ideal" society and locates poems in post-holocaust landscapes. On the other hand, he takes a delight in playfully romanticising only to puncture the illusion. Both tendencies once again recall Beckett. Lukacs has recognised that the modernist concentration on the exceptional has resulted in the pre-eminence in literature of a morbid, paradoxically self-dramatising eccentricity. The artistic emphasis is on the subject (in this poem Mahon more especially than on the Fire-King); the object acting as a reflector. This may be one explanation for the tendency in these poems under discussion for the metaphors to fail to contain the subject's emotions. When this happens, the poem may hover on the edge of sentimentality or even melodrama. However, Mahon's poems are usually anchored in an observable social world and escape the consequences cited by Lukacs as characteristic of much modernist, solipsistic literature. The whimisical romanticism of the first section of "The last of the Fire Kings" hardens into irony as the narrator tries to sort out his conflicts seemingly as he writes. He debates the validity of a self-referential art (operating within a closed-system and analogous to the "real" world in its insistence on abstract potentiality) which is "out of time" since here time is subjectivised, and an art which reveals the complexities and contradictions within an actual society and "within the individual in the context of a dialectical unity".7 Lukacs goes on to note that: "eccentricity is a socially conditioned distortion. The ontology of Geworfenheit makes a true typology impossible; it is replaced by the abstract polarity of the eccentric and the socially average; and this. polarity is held to exhaust human potential."'8 There is a tendency in these poems by Mahon about the artist in society to construct such a polarity of the eccentric and the socially average. Moreover, much of the eccentricity is not (in Lukacs terms) "within the range of a socially normal typology". It derives from the "ontological dogma of the solitariness of man". This does not mean, of course, that Mahon and all other writers who show sympathy with the philosophy of Geworfenheit can be tarred with the same brush. The Fire-King's self-destructive urges, for example, seem evidence of the self- dramatising egocentricity discussed by Lukacs, but we must not forget the romantic playfulness of the first stanzas. There is a long, although relatively straight, road separating romantic self-dramatisation from existential solipsism and Mahon is somewhere on it. To locate him precisely would be neither revelatory nor possible. We may say with confidence that he shares the concerns of many modernist writers (the insubstantiality of personality, the de- throning of man as King of the Universe, the subjectivisation of time, the distinction between artistic subject and object), yet he is continually attracted by "sensuous experience and the 70</page><page sequence="10">world around him". Finally, I wish to extend this discussion to one of Mahon's finest poems, "A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford." The dedication is to J.G. Farrell and the poem relates to his novel Troubles. I cannot read the poem without thinking of the old ladies of Farrell's novel. They inhabit the ironically named "Majestic" hotel. Whatever physical strength they may once have had has been re-directed into maintaining a desperate grip on an anachronistic life of grace and gentility. They are swept into a corner; pathetic yet, I think, ultimately admirable. They cannot adapt to social change, the moulds shaping their lives are too strong. They too seem to cry out "Save us, save us ...!" Their dislocation is all the more horrific because to them the causes seem quite arbitrary. The paradox for Mahon is that although the mushrooms (and the old ladies) are neglected and out of the public eye, it is only in these places that "a thought might grow". Mahon does not invest the mushrooms of his poem with what Douglas Dunn calls "the usual tacile and twittering allegorical purpose of so much bad verse".19 They are the mushrooms of a particular poem; susceptible like everything else. Neglected, the mushrooms have had to perfect those qualities which recur time after time in Mahon's verse: They have learnt patience and silence Listening to the crows querulous in the high wood. Their "cold dream" has not been induced by the self-imposed isolation of the snow party guests, the self-deception of the exile or the Fire-King's "fear of the usurper". They are superfluous to present requirements. Their isolation is superbly evoked in the lines: ... and light since then Is a keyhole rusting gently after rain. Spiders have spun, flies dusted to mildew, And once a day, perhaps, they have heard something - A trickle of masonry, a shout from the blue Or a lorry changing gear at the end of the land. There is a fine control here in the unobtrusive accumulation of subtly affecting details. The outside world moves inexorably through the gears (running down, perhaps, like an ageing machine?) separated from the hotel by a lane (a most vulnerable artery). It is because they have learnt "patience" and "silence" that a thought might still grow (perhaps "vaster than empires" like Marvell's "vegetable love"?) Their resilience has not been easily achieved: There have been deaths, the pale flesh flaking Into the earth that nourished it; And nightmares, born of these and the grim Dominion of stale and rank moisture. Those nearest the door grow stong - Elbow room! Elbow room! The rest, dim in a twilight of crumbling Utensils and broken pitchers, groaning For their deliverance, have been so long Expectant that there is left only the posture. The biblical resonance of lines like "What should they do there but desire?", "groaning/For their deliverance" and "let the god not abandon us/Who have come so far in darkness and in pain" reinforces the impression of the shedbeing a microcosmic equivalent ot universal conditions. It is implied, moreover, that the mushrooms are like Jewish prisoners ot war, crammed into "shower" rooms or cattle- wagons ("Elbow room! Elbow room!"). Later, Mahon refers to "Lost people of Treblinka and Pompeii! Mahon adopts a similar technique in "Day Trip to Donegal" where, ostensibly writing about herring and whiting, he inserts "Their systematic genocide/(Nothing remarkable that millions died)". The mushrooms are like thoughts which must, by implication, decompose in the world at large (like all matter) but which can thrive in these forgotten residual corners ("Peruvian mines", "Indian compounds", "Lime crevices behind rippling rainbarrels"). Their potential is fecund. Mahon suggests that the act of violence which has gutted the hotel has both shut the mushrooms away from the outside world (where such things happen) and caused their decay. They are like the people who are swept into a corner by the winds and explosions of change. They have no self-determination and, consequently, no need for a language. They must cultivate silence. If we think of the mushrooms as being like the innocents who must endure the consequences of violence in Ireland, the following lines are haunting: ... only the ghost of a scream At the flash-bulb firing squad we wake them with Shows there is life yet in their feverish forms. 71</page><page sequence="11">Grown beyond nature now, soft food for worms, They lift frail heads in gravity and good faith. The present generation seem to be implicated in the general abnegation of responsibility, bad faith: A half century without visitors, in the dark - Poor preparation for the cracking lock And creak of hinges. Mahon is speaking on behalf of these victims (he is, of course, implicated himself as an artist). He is responding to the "ghost of a scream". His is only a negative capability. The efficacy of art is always long-term. Suffering and change deserve and demand his attention. In such a world, he must "learn a style from despair".20 He must, at least, keep the door open. In so doing, he may "leave somthing intact". One is reminded of Edna Longley's conclusion: "he seems to suggest on balance that a poet whose art completely evaded the crisis of his countrymen and time might be a lesser poet". The "balance" of this poem (and, indeed, the others from The Snow Party considered here) is not easily achieved. Mahon's yearnings after a "pure existence", a "place out of time", must always be placed alongside his engagement with the actual and unique experiences of daily life ("the halo round a frying pan"). While the disused shed might provide conditions for growth (as solitary contemplation may excite emotions suitable for poetry), the mushrooms will decompose if neglected (as a solipsistic art must suffocate through lack of contact with external reality). The productiveness in these poems of Mahon's consistently ambivalent responses suggests that he will continue to pose such questions in the future. There can be no doubt that the restless, dramatic, ambivalent nature of these poems generates an emotional current of consistently high voltage. NOTES I.
