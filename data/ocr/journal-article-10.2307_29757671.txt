<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Alberto M. Cacopardo and Augusto S. Caco? pardo, Gates of Peristan. History, Religion and Society in the Hindu Kush. With contributions by A. Saeed, MG. Shah, R.F. Strand, Reports and Memoirs, Series Minor, Vol. V, 327 pp., 118 figs. incl. 5 maps and 14 genealogical tables, index, Rome 2001. Since 1973 the two brothers A.M. and A.S. Cacopardo, both ethnologists, have been exploring an area in the southern part of the district of Chitral (northwestern Pakistan) mainly known for the astounding survival of pre-lslamic beliefs and traditions in the small valleys of Rumbur, Bumburet and Birir. These valleys are inhabited by Kalasha Kafirs, also known as the 'Kafirs of Pakistan' or 'Heathens of Paksitan', who still maintain their kafir or 'heathen' culture inspite of constantly mounting pressure from their Muslim neighbours. Their culture is related to that of the 'great Kafirs' in northeastern Afghanistan, made famous in 1896 by G.S. Robertson's book, The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush. As these 'great Kafirs' fell to army imposed Islam - coincidentally also in 1896 - the small population of the 'Kafirs of Pakistan' is all that is left of the pre-lslamic 'primitive' cultures once widespread in the vast mountain area of the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram and the Himalaya before they succumbed to Buddhism or Hinduism or Islam. It is also the last vestige of a genuinely 'primitive' culture in the huge world of 'mainland' Islam. While these Kalasha-Kafirs are already well-known, well-studied and well-published, also by the Cacopardo brothers (see their bibliography), the 'other Kalasha', who converted to Islam, some recently, some in the more distant past, were neglected until 1989 and 1990 when the two brothers undertook surveys. Many of these 'other Kalasha' have lost their original Kalashamun language by assimilating culturally and linguistically to the Kho who dominate in Chitral. Most noteworthy among the 'other Kalasha' is the population in the two valleys of Jin j er et Kuh and Urtsun to the south of the Kalasha-Kafir area. Starting in 1989, the Cacopardo brothers turned their attention also to four non-Kalasha peoples in nearby valleys. They speak other languages and had attracted previously some linguistic research mainly undertaken by the famous Norwegian Indologist G. Morgenstierne. He classified all the languages found in Chitral as belonging to a large group of northwestern Indo-Aryan idioms he called the Dardic languages. The two brothers focused, however, on the oral history and social structure of these peoples: where they came from, when they were Islamized and what remains of their pre-Islamic culture as part of the 'primitive' world of 'greater Kafiristan' once existing in the Hindu Kush and adjacent mountain ranges. The two brothers dealt with the Palula, the largest people among the four, living in two valleys of Ashret and Biyori, the Dameli, inhabiting several villages in the Darnel valley, the tiny population of the Jashi, found only in the two villages, and the Gawar, living in one village in Chitral and five villages across the border in the Kunar valley. As there is no valid term - except the widely used general 'Kohistan' ('Land of Mountains') for some areas - designating not only the studied valleys, but also a greater area corresponding to the notion of a 'Greater Kafiristan', the name 'Peristan' or 'Land of the Fairies' (see p. 22) was chosen. Referring to the narrow gorges protecting 502</page><page sequence="2">the entry into the valleys, the name is meant to cover the whole of northern and partly also northeastern Pakistan as well as the regions of Nuristan, previously known as Kafiristan, and of the Pashai in northeastern Afghanistan. The book's title Gates of Peristan refers to the narrow gorges protecting the entry into the valleys and thus into Peristan. The studied area should be understood as a 'miniature reproduction of Peristan as a whole: Nuristan is represented by the Jashi, the Western Kohistan by the Gawar, Chitral by the Kalasha, the Shina-Burusho area by the Palula, and the Eastern Kohistan by the Dameli' (p. 18). This 'miniature reproduction' is based, for the most part, on linguistic data, a few written sources and many oral historical traditions. This highly interesting study has - after a preface writted by the noted cultural anthro? pologist Ugo Fabietti and the acknowledgments - an introduction (pp. 13-24), seven chapters, three appendices, a list of informants, biblio? graphy, a list of maps and an index. The first chapter (by both A.M. and A.S. Cacopardo, pp. 25-44), named 'Peristan', deals with Peristan in a general sense, mainly discussing local cultures, ancient trade routes, the 'borders of Kafiristan', Islamization, and the social stratification. The last subchapter gives well deserved criticism of G. Fussman's rather strange theory of castes in Kafiristan, a theory called 'illusion' by A.M.C. in another context (p. 106). Chapter 2 by A.S.C. (pp. 45-78), named 'Chitral', provides a history of Chitral (mainly connected with the local Mehtar rulers, dethroned in 1969), short 'Notes' on the culture of the Kalasha Kafirs and on the 'other Kalasha', and a description of the local geography somewhat improperly titled 'The Present Research'. A detailed account of the field research focusing nearly exclusively on the Kalasha Kafirs is actually given in a preceding subchapter with the long title 'The Last Decades of the Mehtars and the Developments of Anthropological Research'. Inexplicably, therein the Cacopardo research trips are not mentioned. They are referred to only randomly when describing the four populations in the chapters three to six. The 'Notes on the Kalasha' (pp. 67-74), on the already well studied Kalasha Kafirs - the Islamised Kalasha being called 'the other Kalasha' are very short, comprising only about four pages of text. One would have wished to find a more thorough general presentation and more information on already published or still unpublished Cacopardo findings. Chapter 3 (by A.M.C., pp. 79-144), on the Palula, is essentially the central topic of the study, including six genealogical tables. It describes the ethnohistory of that people, its exploration, the habitat, economy, customs, oral traditions and politics, even its genealogies, and its pre-Islamic culture. The data are rich in written and oral traditions such as the legends of Choke-Machoke, which cast some light on the local history and the people's reported former habitat in the Chilas area in the Indus valley. As this area of 'eastern Peristan' was a centre of small Buddhist states in the first half of the 1st millennium A.D., representing at times 'the full bloom of Peristani Buddhism' (p. 90) as seen in countless local petroglyphs (fig. 34), the study on the Palula includes the theory that their migration from Chilas to their present homeland was due to a rebellion of 'free tribes of Peristan against the imposition of autocratic rule' (p. 93). With regard to the pre-Islamic culture of the Palula, to the local 'pre-Islamic lore of Peristan' (p. 142), assumedly imported partially from Chilas and adjacent areas in 'eastern Peristan', there is most importantly a written source mentioning temples and anthropomorphic idols worshipped therein. In addition, the two brothers were able to collect some information on typically Kafir vestiges. One informant recalled the existence of two of the typical Kafir women's confinement houses, locally called nasheli (thus sounding very similar to the bashali of the Kalasha Kafirs), with one of them located 'inside a cave' (p. 148, see below). There are stories of man-eating witch-like spirits, the rui, and of fairies called peireini dwelling near magic 'glacial lakes' (p. 142). Strangely, or perhapts by an informant's mistake, a rui-like type of spirit 'with her eyes turned vertically' was called a peiri (p. 141) while - unmentioend by A.M.C. - similar looking spirits in Afghan Kafiristan, the evil utr or w?tri, were clearly discerned from the rather benevolent fairies, known there as s?chi and corresponding to the 503</page><page sequence="3">notion of peri (see below Klimburg 1999: 157). Informants narrated also of golden and silver vessels found near the 'magic lakes' (p. 142). These stories constitute classic features in the folklore of Kafiristan/Nuristan, where large golden stemmed drinking cups (normally made of silver) were often singled out among the found magic objects. A.M.C.'s reference to similar looking cups seen in Central Asian paintings of the 6th-8th century A.D. as showing 'a direct trace from Buddhist times' (ibid.) would better be understood as indicating links with the courtly world of non-Buddhist Sogdian silk road traders, a world at times dominated by Buddhism. Finally, a locally found 'Peristani-style' chair with horn-like finials recalls the 'horn-chairs' of Kafir dignitaries and possibly also the 'golden chair' of the legendary Machole and his son Laphore (pp. 139 ff.). Chapter 4 (by A.S.C., pp. 145-72) gives a similar, but shorter account of the Dameli, 'the smallest linguistic community', featuring mainly economic, social and historical information complete with three genealogical charts. There are no reported traces of pre-lslamic traditions. Many such traces are described in Chapter 5 (by A.M.C., pp. 173-226) which deals with the Jashi, believed to represent descendants of the oldest inhabitants of Peristan. They live in two villages on both sides of the border. One of these villages, Gawardesh, lying across the border in Afghanistan, provides a link to the cultural world of the Kam Kafirs, presently Kam Nuristani, who once formed the power centre of eastern Kafiristan in Afghanistan. This cultural link made the two brothers undertake, in 1995, a trip 'under rather adventurous conditions' (p. 176) across the border to that village. They were thus able to catch at least a glimpse from the periphery of the easternmost part of fabled Nuristan. They enjoyed 'formidable luck' (ibid.) in collecting much information on Kam Kafir related beliefs and traditions during their stay of only two days, as their hosts feared for their lives and insisted on their early departure. Briefly commenting, I would like to refer first to the shor katwo, a cave in an 'almost perpendicular cliff of sheer rock, facing the village' of Gawardesh (fig. 80), to where women had to retreat when menstruating and when giving birth - a concept which 'is rather awe inspiring to our mind. But such were the conditions of the time' (p. 208). However, in Kafiristan such caves served as places to give birth only to unmarried women, as A.M.C. himself states in the attached footnote 346. Surely also in Gawardesh the typical Kafir house for the confinement of socially acceptable women considered impure while menstruating and giving birth must have existed, but apparently were not mentioned to the two Italians. In the Kati language of eastern Kafiristan these houses were generally known as psh?'amu. A second comment is on the description given to the wood carving with the diamond-like motif in the centre, shown in fig. 64. It appears to have an erotic connotation rather than one related to the wide-spread 'head and horns of a he-goat' motif, hardly 'one of the most controversial and mysterious symbols from pre-Islamic times' (p. 192). More or less explicit sexual symbolism was widely present in the Kafir arts, and diamonds or lozenges certainly represent not only abstract renderings of goat's heads, but above all the vulva. Chapter 6 by A.S.C. (pp. 227-48) is on the Gawar, a small ethnic group with no remaining links to Gawardesh ('Gawar-village'), living mainly across the border in Afghanistan. Researching in the only Gawar community on the Chitral side, a rather brief account - comprising also four genealogical charts - is given of the local ethnohistory, political system, and the very little which is left of pre-Islamic cultural features. In essence, the Kafir past is present only in the legends of fairies living next to a locally famous 'enchanted lake' high up in the mountains and in myths related to the formation of the valley where the village under study is located. In Chapter 7 (pp. 249-50) A.M.C. presents 'Conclusions'. He refers to oral traditions which tell us of the conquest of southern Chitral in the 17th/18th century by the Rais, the dynasty ruling in Chitral until their dethronement by the Pakistan government in 1969. His statement that the four studied populations 'were mostly converted [to Islam] around the middle of the 19th century' should probably be altered into 504</page><page sequence="4">'[...] until the middle of the 19th century'. He then describes a model of 'archaic' political micro-systems found within all the four populations. This so-called 'brothers model', based on democratic sharing of power and reciprocal sharing of goods and services, is surrounded by the hierarchical and centralized 'father model' of the 'urbanocentric world'. This can be said, of course, of untold communities worldwide. More specifically, the local ideal image of this 'brothers model' includes geographical concepts of purity and impuirity. Puirity increases the higher one goes on the mountains and to mysterious lakes in the valleys' upper reaches as 'abodes of fairies, or gods, or other spirits'; impurity increases as one descends in the valleys with their women folks. 'The valley is closed below by natural gates of narrow defile; it is open towards the mountains and the lake' (p. 250). This concept can certainly be applied to the whole area and beyond. There is no specific reference to the mentioned traces of the typically Kafir (here: 'Peristan') segregation of the sexes and the division of labour in accordance with the once stringent concepts of purity versus impurity (e.g. on pp. 101 f?). The chapter on conclusions is followed by three appendices on 'The Tongues or Peristan' (by R.F. Strand, pp. 251-59) together with a table listing the languages of the Hindu Kush (as Strand insists on using only the indigenous names, e.g. the Waigali language appears as 'kalaSa-al?'), 'Morgenstierne in Urtsun' (by A.S.C.), and 'Palula Voices on Palula History' (by M.G. Shah, A.Saeed and R.F. Strand), as well as a list of informants, an exhaustive bibliography, a list of maps, and a very reliable, comprehensive index. The 14-page bibliography (pp. 303-16) lists virtually everything published before 1999, the closing year of work on the book (see n. 135) - with only two noticed exceptions, as stated by J. Frembgen in his review (Central Asian Journal, 47/2, 2003, pp. 298-300); H. van Skyhaw, Eibi Kisar. Ein Volksepos im Burushaski von Nager, Wiesbaden 1966; A. Schmid, Die Dom zwischen sozialer Ohnmacht und kultureller Macht. Interethnische Beziehungen in Nordpakistan, Stuttgart 1997. 'Gates of Peristan', the 'Gates of the Land of Fairies', is a profound study in 'ethnography of memory', as Fabietti phrased it (p. 9). It is a study of southern Chitral communities little known before, with pain-staking adherence to details and published materials, and with innumerable references. It is, however, and it cannot be otherwise, a 'conglomerate', consisting of rather independent, sometimes strangely structured essays dealing with linguistically diverse peoples. They are held together only by their membership in the family of northwest Indo-Aryan (or 'Dardic') languages, their somewhat ephemeral 'Kafir past', their 'acephalous' political systems, and - the notion of a fairyland, 'Peristan'. The two brothers, having 'decided to turn to pure fantasy', have adopted this title from a text by a notoriously unreliable British adventurer, A. Gardner, who somehow travelled through northeastern Afghanistan in the first half of the 19th century (see pp. 14 ff.). Incidentally, in Kafirstan/Nuristan one finds only few fairy tales by comparison to the numerous (and often very lengthy) gruesome tales of heroic fights of the Kafir gods and goddesses or the Kafirs themselves. Accordingly, 'Peristan' appears rather as a land once dominated by roving killers and wealthy 'party-givers', both given to much bragging and wine-drinking. True, the peri have survived, not only in 'Peristan', but also in the whole Iranian world (peri being a common Persian word), while the world of divinities, status-seeking killing and hosting, and status-showing arts is gone - with the exception of the nowadays much reduced status-seeking and status-showing in the culture of the Kalasha Kafirs. The frequent use of 'acephalous com? munities', 'tribes' or even 'acephalous tribes' (e.g. on p. 40) found in the study appears unfortunate. I would like to comment that - in accordance with J. Frembgen's statement in his review of the study (see above) - the term 'acephalous' should better be replaced by 'segmentary'. The term 'segmentary republic', also an option, is burdened by the notion of 'republic' in a urbanocentric context. The terms 'tribes' or 'tribal' should be avoided, as in general they are no genealogical links between 505</page><page sequence="5">different, but culturally closely related communities with their often numerous local, exagomous lineages. This is the case in Nuristan and, to a lesser extent, in southern Chitral, e.g. with the Palula speaking people in the Biyori valley. Lineage bonds with a shared ancestry linking small clusters of villages, as is the case with the Kalasha Kafirs in the Rumbur valley and with the Palula in the Ashret valley, do not make the population a tribal section of a greater unit. The question of why the Palula living in Ashret have a somewhat 'tribal' looking structure and the Palula living in Biyori have none could possibly be explained by influences from the Dir Pashtuns with their tribal social organisation. These Pashtuns are closely connected with the Ashret since Chitral's most important line of communication with the outside runs through both valleys, separated by the Lowri (Lowari) pass. In addition, as is well known, many of the genealogical charts are recent constructs for whatever reasons. It is thus very likely that the whole of 'Peristan' or 'Greater Kafiristan', was once populated by peoples living in segmentary village communties until in some areas state-like structured societies established themselves. Kafir or Nuristani? Out of respect for the feelings of the Nuristani and also for more general reasons, the Cacopardo brothers insist on speaking of Nuristan and the Nuristani even when discussing Kafiristan and the Kafirs. Therefore they were, and certainly still are, unhappy about my constant use of the latter names, such as in my two-volume study of the Waigal and Ashkun 'Kafirs' under the originally Robertson title The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush (Wiesbaden 1999). In his long and mostly very positive review of that study (EW, 49, 1-4, 1999, pp. 315-20) A.M.C. demands that the term 'Kafir', when used to identify the pre-lslamic cultures of Nuristan, 'ought to be definitively banned from literature'. He claims that 'it is intensely disliked by the Nuristanis of today', that 'the 'Kafir' world was once much larger than Nuristan' (p. 319), that by speaking of Kafiristan in Robertson's and my sense one would tend to ignore the larger Kafiristan still existing as recently as in the beginning of the 19th century. However, contrary to A.M.C.'s belief to know the feelings in Nuristan (where he never was, except for two days at the periphery), I genuinely felt interest or even pride rather than shame when asking (mostly very old) informants about their knowledge of the Kafir past, even when confronted with devout Muslims among them. In addition, there was and is no objection to the use of 'Kafir' in official circles in Kabul. As to 'greater Kafiristan', it is certainly true that the Kafir region was once much larger, but already by the middle of the 19th century it was reduced more or less to the size of Robertson's Kafiristan, the present Nuristan, made to one of the (at present) 34 provinces of Afghanistan some 14 years ago (see my 'The situation in Nuristan', Central Asian Survey, 20, 2001, pp. 393-90). In short, Kafirs and Kafiristan are terms which are quite well defined and should be used whenever dealing mainly with the area's pre Islamic past. In view of the very carefully researched and written study, one does not expect to find any major mistakes or omissions. Only very few lacunae could be noticed. One of them is mentioned with regard to the pre-Islamic culture of the Palula. As a second omission Wynne Maggi's year-long stay in Rumbur, in around 1995, studying the life of Kalasha Kafir women is not mentioned in A.S.C.'s account of anthropological research. Her captivating study Our Women Are Free, published in 2001, presents a good example of hiding the identity of informants, in her case mostly women, for the sake of protection from (most probably unwarranted) persecution. In the Peristan study the opposite exists, namely a list of 74 named and 2 anonymous informants, one of them female, complete with age estimates and the dates and locations of the interviews. That is certainly academically most laudable, though probably ineffectual, regardless of the unnecessary need to prove the two brothers' trustworthyness. I would have wished more information on the Cacopardo brothers' research trips into the area: they started in 1973, followed by a long period without field-work, and then continued their agt times very brief field-work in 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1995, as it would appear. 506</page><page sequence="6">The maps are very well designed. Only a genuine expert is able to find some flaws. In the large fold-out map (fig. 1), which covers the large area from the Panjshir valley in Afghanistan to Baltistan in northeastern Pakistan, the Nuristani settlement of Pashki, the southernmost and also main village in the Prasun (Parun) valley - since several years also the capital of the newly created Afghan province 'Nuristan' - is not shown. The map 'Gates of Peristan' on fig. 17 is excellent. The unfortunately undated photos are well printed, with some exceptions, and some of them should have been presented much larger. The expensive (and heavy) coated paper makes the study somewhat weighty, and its binding impedes an easy wide opening of the large format book All in all, it's a great publication, though somewhat 'conglomeratic', on the ethnohistory, social structure, economy and the pre-Islamic past of four small ethnic groups living in southern Chitral. This thorough study deserves the scholarly attention much needed for more research on cultures in danger of disappearing, easy victims of aggressive modernisation. Max Klimburg ?</page></plain_text>
