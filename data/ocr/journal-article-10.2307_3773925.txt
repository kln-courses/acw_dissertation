<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCED WRITING AND CHRISTIANITY: DIFFERENTIAL ACCESS TO RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO1 ~1'' ~~~~~t ~~Roger Ivar Lohmann Western Oregon University Among the precontact Asabano of Duranmin, Papua New Guinea, older men kept secret myths revealed during initiations. Their religious knowledge gave them moral authority and privilege as enculturators. Since mass conversion to Christianity, the Bible is the new source of religious knowledge, and those able to read the Bible tell elders the myths written inside. Older men no longer function as experts of religious knowledge, which is now stored in books, to which only young people have direct access, resulting in a reversal of the age- and gender-based social structure. Scripture's ability to preserve and extend access to religious knowledge, combined with Christianity's doctrine of anti- secrecy, made this social change appealing because all sensed a net gain in access to religious power. (Writing technology, cultural transmission, literacy, authority, missionary, religion, Melanesia) Writing is frequently associated with religion because it enables high-fidelity communications with people distant in space and time, with the long dead, and by implication with spiritual powers often believed to animate and inhabit the natural world. Like other technological devices, writing provides truly marvelous power that the human imagination easily extends beyond its natural capacities to supernatural ones. Indeed, any interaction between human and environment may produce a sense that the world is responsive and animate, and therefore humanlike. Anthropomorphic images of environmental components (e.g., spirits and gods) are at the core of religiosity (Guthrie 1997). Therefore, anything that makes the nonhuman world seem humanlike stirs religious thinking. As human actions are followed by changes in the environment, there is a sense of communication between person and cosmos. Just as learning a language enables children to elicit detailed and accurate responses from their parents, learning to use technologies promotes the impression that natural objects directly respond to signals and are therefore, perhaps, capable of human sociality. That is, as technologies enhance human abilities to project their desires upon and mold the natural world, they further humanize the cosmos and stimulate the religious imagination. In myths, socialized universes in the form of supernatural beings understand human language and can communicate with people. Magic and prayer are essentially two-way communications people direct at humanlike forces of the supernatural realm that, according to religious believers, predicate the natural order (cf. Leach 1976:29-32). Writing is often seen as a way to improve the reception in such conversations with the supernatural, as Goody (1986:35, 38-39, 2000:87) documents. While writing can depersonalize face-to-face contacts among people as records replace relationships (Goody and Watt 1963), religious use of writing in scripture, 93 ETHNOLOGY vol. 40 no. 2, Spring 2001, pp. 93-111.

In sum, writing enables verbatim communication across great expanses of space and time: a striking technical achievement that people easily associate with a spiritual realm. Scripture amplifies the human voices given to the cosmos by myth, as the exact words of deceased ancestors, place spirits, and creator gods can be heard by reading or listening to recitations of holy writings. The use of writing for magic and prayer allows people an appealing way to talk back to the deities. This article traces effects of the introduction of Christian scripture upon religious enculturation among the Asabano, who are known to their Telefolmin neighbors and the government as the Duranmin. The Asabano are an ethnolinguistic group of about 200 residing in remote hamlets nestled among muddy, forested mountains and rushing rivers in Sandaun Province. They were first contacted by Australian government officials in 1963. As elders recall, immediately prior to Western contact, a male-focused initiatory religion maintained secret myths and rituals directed mainly at garden fertility and success in hunting and war. Older men enjoyed status as authorities of the most secret-sacred (walemaw) religious knowledge, and oversaw its control and oral dissemination. This system was disrupted when Baptist missionaries from the Telefolmin, their neighbors and former enemies, began working among the Asabano in 1974, and was destroyed when secrets and sacra were exposed and desecrated during a revival movement in 1977 that precipitated the mass conversion of the Asabano to Christianity. Asabano elders and juniors came to doubt the veracity of the oral teachings they received when faced with the openness and apparent universal relevance of Christian religious knowledge. At first, the Bible could be directly read only by young foreigners (in their twenties and thirties) who worked among them. Since the founding of government community schools in neighboring areas, starting in the late 1960s and locally in 1987, many young people of both sexes now read and write and serve as go-betweens communicating biblical scripture to their illiterate elders. By the mid-1990s, the youth had replaced the old men as religious experts. But because of the open distribution of Christian religious knowledge, youths have no superiority over elders, and no restrictive system controlling religious encultura- tion has developed to replace the traditional men's secret initiatory society. The sociology of religious transmission has thus been dramatically altered, but those formerly privileged with the power to enculturate have apparently not objected to the evaporation of their position in society because they feel they continue to benefit from the openly shared religious knowledge of Christianity. The observations here about written versus oral media of religious reception, storage, and transmission suggest that while writing, scripture, and recitation present a much more stable form of storage for religious ideas than do speaking/hearing, memory, and oral storytelling, in the spread of religious ideas the vital feature is access to information, not the medium in which these ideas are recorded. To be sure, writing offers a means of transmitting ideas across vast distances; however, writing</page><page sequence="3">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO is not unique in this regard. Sound and picture recordings, stored biologically or extrabiologically, and transportation techniques, from walking to supersonic flight, allow individuals bearing knowledge in memory to reach exotic shores. The important question is whether the bearer of ideas chooses to communicate his or her knowledge with others, and if so, with whom. Writing, I argue, is an aid to cultural diffusion, but not a necessary condition for conversion (cf. Goody 2000:106). THE POLITICS OF RELIGIOUS TRANSMISSION Traditionally, older men maintained control over mythological and magical information in a religious hierarchy based on gender and age. At the top were old men, and at the bottom were young girls. Sequences of initiations were designed to transmit this knowledge to young men and boys (for a description of Asabano initiation sequences, see Lohmann 2000a: 111-44). Some postmenopausal women were privy to certain secrets, and marriageable girls received a separate, single initiation under the gaze of the senior men. During initiations, men revealed ancestral bones and other sacred objects, told myths and legends associated with them, and taught techniques to influence supernatural beings. Above all, they stressed the importance of keeping these things secret from the uninitiated. Initiatory status was marked by the presentation of special foods that had previously been taboo. Men who had undergone all initiations were thus allowed to eat the most foods, while uninitiated boys and the female population were restricted by many food taboos. In Asabano tradition, men retained a morally and intellectually superior position in society (Kelly 1993). The food taboos relegated the women and children to a secondary status (Meigs 1984; Whitehead 2000). Initiated men ate preferred meats and other foods in public and also as part of secret feasts associated with male initiations. A clear gender and age hierarchy existed simultaneously with an otherwise egalitarian band-like social organization that lacked big men and had only a degree of skill specialization characteristic of a great-man society (Godelier 1986). Old men led the initiations, for they were the keepers of the most secret myths that told of the actions of culture heroes, known as the Old Man and the Old Woman, who had changed the landscape and established customs. Though they speak a non-Mountain Ok language, Asabano share with Mountain Ok or Min peoples the belief that they are children of the Old Woman, who traveled throughout the region establishing peoples and customs (Craig and Hyndman 1990). She is known most widely by her Telefol designation of Afek, but to the Asabano as Semodu (meaning an older but not yet feeble woman). A common feature of Min religions is a layering of external, public, and profane myth versions and internal, secret, and sacred myth versions (Barth 1975; Jorgensen 1981). For example, in public the Old Woman is called simply Semodu, but initiates learned that her secret-sacred name is Asehu. Among the Asabano, esoteric versions were to be told only under the appropriate ritual conditions, such as when formerly taboo foods were fed to novices in the men's secret-sacred house (nuwalemawbu). Upon these occasions the boys usually learned 95</page><page sequence="4">96 ETHNOLOGY secret names for the food item, a song or chant, and a myth fragment that explained the origin of the item's significance. Such foods were referred to by the name of their quintessential form, the meat of the terrestrial phalanger or kuyamodu, which was only to be eaten by males who had undergone the appropriate initiation in which they received a helping from a senior man. The uninitiated (women and children) were allowed neither to eat it nor to know its secret name, story, song, or chant. Should these taboos be broken, the dogma stated, food would no longer be forthcoming for the people: sweet potato plants would produce only vines, and hunters' eyes would be closed so that they could bring in no game. Certain of the men's rituals were supposed to ensure the fertility of gardens or of fruiting trees. The ritual planting of cordyline, sometimes with an ancestor's bone or other sacred items, to the accompaniment of specific chants, was believed necessary for a successful harvest. Knowledge of which plants and items to use, which chants to use, and so on was passed on by older men to boys in initiations, from which women and boys too young to be initiated were excluded. The more religious knowledge held by an older man, the greater his value to society as a whole, for he was able to do what was needed for people to survive, and to judiciously pass on his knowledge. The power of these techniques depended upon their remaining secret as much as it did upon their being performed in ritual. It is clear, then, that secrecy was about rendering a practice powerful, psychologically and magically, by restricting its circumstance of enactment. Writing of the Poro secret society of West Africa, Bellman (1984:5) states that "it is best to consider secrecy, not as a power struggle between those who know and those who want to know, but according to the ways concealed information is revealed." Crook (1999) presents a rich and sophisticated description of secrecy among distant neighbors of the Asabano, the Angkaiyakmin of Bolivip village, where traditional religion continues to be openly practiced alongside Catholicism. His analysis calls into question a simple dichotomous or layered understanding of public versus secret religious knowledge among Min groups. "As widely reported among the Min, the expectation of a side to things always kept hidden is pervasive. In Bolivip this takes the form of a skeptical assumption of incompletion-that examples require other examples, new knowledge requires old knowledge and speakers require listeners for completion-rather than referring to some inaccessible secret realm" (Crook 1999:228). Unlike the Angkaiyakmin, the Asabano had a much simpler distinction between public and secret religious knowledge associated with particular foods or levels of initiation. When I was in the field, many still remembered the traditional religion being practiced. Older women denied having known about secret myth versions or details about men's religious activities. They had no reason to lie about this, for the revival movement upon which their current religiosity was built featured the desecration of men's secretly kept ancestral bone relics, myth versions, and rituals by exposure to women and children. For traditional Asabano, when elder men showed their secret religious knowledge to initiates, cultural transmission occurred, and the conditions for preserving religious power were maintained. By contrast, to</page><page sequence="5">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO expose this knowledge to women and children, as occurred in the revival, was to render the knowledge impotent, as Tuzin (1997) documents in his study of a similar movement in the Arapesh village of Ilahita. Among some peoples secrecy is more concerned with tabooing the exposure of certain knowledge in inappropriate social circumstances than with actually keeping the information completely unknown to others, as appears to be the case among both the Angkaiyakmin and Poro. However, the Asabano protected the secrecy of their religious knowledge by proclaiming it not only useless to the uninitiated, but also subject to complete power loss or disaster should secrets be inappropriately spoken or revealed. Much of the knowledge that they considered secret and sacred appears to have actually remained unknown to women and children. The Poro society's secrets have changed over time, but the society itself is hundreds of years old, leading Bellman (1984:17) to conclude that, for secret societies, the "contents of the secrets are not as significant as are the doing of secrecy and the recognition that a do-not-talk-it proscription is a feature of all legitimate social interactions." His point is the same as Barth's (1998 [1969]) famous reminder that customs serving as ethnic boundary-markers define groups more powerfully than the taken-for-granted traditions they contain. Secrecy is itself a boundary-marker that circumscribes divisions within society between those who know and those who should not know. Wagner (1984) observes of Melanesian secret initiations that secrecy is directed at controlling people's ability to actively work to understand deeper meanings of significant ideas. An additional point to bear in mind is that those who do reach the appropriate age and gender status and are told secrets are also given the power to transmit sacred knowledge to others within conditions of propriety. Among the Asabano and many other peoples with secretive traditions, those who know should ideally transmit to novices the same knowledge that they received from their own initiators. When Asabano elders described their initiations to me, they frequently said that, having been shown a secret technique such as cordyline planting, they were told by their fathers and grandfathers, "We have shown you what the ancestors showed us; you must do the same for your children." In practice, however, human memory is imperfect and knowledge placed in its care is no doubt submitted to further ruminations and interpretations, and changed somewhat when passed to the next generation. As Barth (1987) shows in discussing oral transmission of secrets among Min societies, secrecy itself aids the transformation of religious knowledge. Alternating between long periods of inactivity in which ritual techniques are stored in memory, and creative theatrical bursts when initiations and other rituals are held, details are forgotten and must be borrowed and improvised. For Asabano men, secrecy protected both their knowledge of the supernatural realm and their power to influence it. However, as Jorgensen (1981) describes of their neighbors, the Telefolmin, they had a sense that religious knowledge was being lost to attrition, that they did not know as much as their ancestors had. Elders were therefore obliged to transmit as much traditional religious knowledge as possible, lest they succumb as a people to entropy and oblivion. As Goffman (1969) observes 97</page><page sequence="6">98 ETHNOLOGY regarding secrecy, people strategize to obtain, hide, and differentially display bits of information in order to achieve ends that seem desirable at the time. In periods of stress, more importance may be placed on simply passing on as much secret knowledge as possible. This became increasingly difficult for Asabano elders to accomplish, for in the decades leading up to contact and pacification by the Australian government, they suffered many losses at the hands of their enemies in war and of "cannibal witches" in the form of disease and accidents. Many elders died, and in some cases they were forced to give abridged initiations to ensure that at least some of their religious knowledge was passed on to enable their descendants to survive. Asabano religious knowledge was already being lost at an uncomfortably high rate by the time the mission arrived and offered them a way out through access to a new kind of religious knowledge. Bercovitch (1989:39), in his study of the Nalumin (Atbalmin), distant neighbors of the Asabano, notes that secrecy comes in many degrees and that "every representation is also a misrepresentation, every act of disclosure is also an act of concealment." There is no such thing as perfect, complete communication. Ritual secrecy builds on recognition of the fact that there is always a more accurate version of religious knowledge out there, which is presumably more powerful because of its greater truth and elusiveness. Traditional Asabano believed that the truer and more complete versions were known by the oldest men, who had heard the most from their own fathers and grandfathers, who possessed still more accurate and complete religious knowledge. The introduction of written religious knowledge seemed to provide a primeval and therefore much more accurate source of mythological truth and ritual technique than the oldest men's memories. Further, access to scriptural knowledge does not depend on individual elders' desire to tell or conceal; it is accessible to anyone who learns to read. THE INTRODUCTION OF WRITING The first encounter the Asabano had with writing occurred when a government patrol paid a visit to their village to establish contact and investigate a report of an intertribal raid that had taken place recently (Marks 1963). The patrol officer had reliable information, but when he arrived to inform the Asabano that intergroup warfare would not be tolerated by the administration, they tried to conceal their recent fighting from the patrol. Simolibo, an Asabano man who was a little boy at the time, described his memory of the event. "The patrol officer wrote down everyone's name [for the census], and then finally said he had heard the men had been fighting the Sisimin, and was that true? Everyone said no, they hadn't, but he looked down in his book and said, 'No, it says here that you did.'" With this first official contact, the power of writing was demonstrated. The patrol officer cited the written report of their fight as evidence against their denial. Though the people lied, it did not escape their attention that the written report told the truth they sought to hide. Superior knowledge had been demonstrated, and a number of</page><page sequence="7">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO Asabano men went willingly with the patrol to stand trial in Wewak, eager to establish good relations with the clearly powerful whites. Let off with a warning, the arrested men had now seen the ocean and a town, they had flown in airplanes and been driven in a car. The power of writing was clearly tied to all of these wonders. The fact that Marks and later patrol officers wrote down names for the census strongly impressed the Asabano as well. People frequently take on new names and nicknames, and even in the 1990s most people were known by multiple designations. This practice of course frustrated government officials (and the anthropologist), whose written records on individuals became difficult to use when the same person was referred to by different names on different occasions. The Asabano recognized the officialness of written versions of their names. A middle-aged father asked me one day to please use his original name of Muluasi, though no one else does. He told me that years ago, while he was away working on a tea plantation in Mount Hagen, people told the census-taker a Telefolized version of his name, Alimisep, and it was so recorded. Though he dislikes the name, and Asabano find it difficult to pronounce, because the written form of his name is considered more authoritative, people now call him Alemeliya, an Asabanized version of the Telefolized name. Having become accustomed to the government in Papua New Guinea, the Asabano soon became aware of the new religious order sweeping the country. In 1974, when Telefolmin missionaries commenced work among the Asabano, people found that prayer to God worked as well as their entreaties to indigenous supernatural beings. Crops of exceptionally large sweet potatoes and successful hunts following dreams of the Holy Spirit were important early indicators that the new beliefs were true. Like the patrol officers who came before them, the missionaries arrived holding what appeared to Asabano to be bundles of bound leaves, variegated in black and white. Pastors voiced incantations somehow contained in these mysterious objects. The word in Asaba for book is senebu, or leaf; and the Bible is called senewalemaw- bu, or sacred leaf. The Asabano knew that these bundles of leaves were associated with the mysterious and powerful white people who had recently appeared in neighboring areas. Missionaries cited the widespread distribution of the Bible and the religious knowledge it contains as the reason intertribal wars had ended: a position that is generally accepted today by the Asabano. Consider what a young man named Asea from Sisimin, living among the Asabano, said: Before, my [adoptive] father Sablaio's people used to fight with the Telefolmin, but now ... when the revival happened, it was finished right away. So I think the word of the Lord has power-this [fighting] is no good. Pastors Daniel and Wani, and Obert [a literate man of about twenty] told me this is in the Bible. If it were the law of the government only, we'd still be fighting, but because it's in the Bible it's finished. In the 1977 revival movement, many people fell to the floor and saw visions. Kanau, a middle-aged Asabano man, recalled a religious experience similar to many told by others. 99</page><page sequence="8">100 ETHNOLOGY I saw the spirit of God kick all the people, making them fall down. I myself got a hot face, felt weak, and fell down with my eyes open; and I saw Jesus standing with a book. The [Holy] Spirit was there and God was there, and I thought, "It's true, the Child of God exists." My eyes were staring blankly; then I saw something like a dream. Jesus was standing by a cross and holding a Bible and the [Holy] Spirit said, "You people believed in false gods before-it's not true, Jesus is number one, you must believe in Him and the [Holy] Spirit must be in your belly." The authority of the Bible-the quintessential form of writing to Asabano-was revealed directly to Kanau and many others by such visions and dreams of it resting in Jesus's hands. The Asabano view writing as a boon for communicating religious knowledge within and beyond human society. Pastor Wani of the Asabano hamlet of Yakob, where I conducted fieldwork, explained why written Christian myths introduced in the 1970s were more believable to him than oral Asabano myths. The Bible they wrote down in ancient times, and they [Christians] just followed this. The [Asabano] ancestral stories were just told by word of mouth. They [the ancestors who passed on the myths] didn't see anything. [The missionaries] Diyos, Keni, and Sagansep changed my mind on these stories. They said, "These ancestral stories are only stories; you haven't seen them yourself. But the Bible stories of what Jesus did were written down and we can see them. So they're really true." I thought they were right when they said that. From their very first encounter with writing, when Patrol Officer Marks used a written document to back up his claims, the Asabano learned that the marks on the bundled leaves were symbols not only of words, but of true words, powerful words. The status of whites as ordinary human beings was not yet certain. Some of the texts they saw were written by whites, and when missionaries arrived with their Bibles, said to be the "talk of God," it became clear that many texts had been set down by supernatural beings. The authorship of the Bible is somewhat ambiguous in the Christian tradition: though human hands are usually understood to have written it, God is seen as inspiring or directing their pens, in which case the actual agency behind the text becomes blurred. Many Asabano state clearly that God is the author, and that this is a good reason to believe the Bible's statements. One young mother named Ena said, "God wrote this in the Bible, so it must be true. I believe this because the Pastors looked in the Bible and said it's true that God wrote it." Others state it in the more esoteric manner that is fashionable among Western Christians, like Obai, a young man who was attending community school in Sumwari: "The Bible is true because long ago the Lord Himself worked inside of the disciples to make the Bible." Another young man named Jim, enrolled at Telefomin2 Vocational School, confided, "We are confused still about who wrote the Bible. Sometimes we [older men and boys] sit down and discuss who wrote this Bible. The older men ask us who wrote it, and we just tell them that we have to follow it." Throughout the early years of the revival movement, very few Asabano could read and write. Those who could turned their skill directly to the bundle of leaves that supposedly contained the words of the creator God. Initially, people were</page><page sequence="9">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO impressed by the plausibility of the Christian myths simply because they were written down. Pictures in the Bible seemed to be residual evidence backing up the missionaries' claims, and as trusted persons became able to read the Bible, the words reputed to be contained in the book were confirmed, and their solidity contrasted sharply with the fragile oral record of Asabano mythology. An illiterate father named Sokiale commented, The Bible stories are true. The Old Woman and the Old Man [of Asabano mythologyl didn't write anything-they are just oral stories, so we thought when we saw the things of the white man and heard that Jesus will come, we thought it must be true. I believed it because God had written it in the Bible. The false stories weren't written down-they were only stories. Now we can look at pictures and know it's true. People not only recognize the written word's actual power to preserve and transmit information, but they often also attribute to it a supernatural power to provide a direct line of communication with the forebears they mythologize. The Asabano feel they can see what Jesus did through written accounts: a form of event residue that is important in Asabano epistemology (Lohmann 2000b:80-81). As writing aids the high-fidelity transmission of religious beliefs across cultural divides, such beliefs appear to be more universally true (Goody 2000:106). As Goody (1968a:2) writes, "If literate religions are in some ways less flexible, they are also more universalistic." Universalism is also inherent in Christian doctrine, which declares that this religion is for all peoples. To the Asabano, Christianity's universal truth is supported by its scriptural base and wide dissemination in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, and also by its policy of open access to all of its myths for everyone, regardless of age or initiatory status. In consequence, a new notion of sanctity based upon open sharing of universally valid religious knowledge has overtaken the traditional concept of the sacred as deriving power from secrecy (Lohmann 2000a:230-36). Asabano perceive Christianity to be a vast global power that supersedes local social systems and derives its strength from its universal truth. Religious universality was at the time of Western contact a very foreign concept for Melanesians, and local groups creatively continue to explore ways of reconciling their particularistic traditions with one they now believe to be universally true. For example, to make local stories fit universalistic Christian myth, Angkaiyakmin incorporate traditional stories into church services, comparing them to New Testament myths as though Jesus were expressing the same stories in his own way (Crook 1999:226). Among the Chambri, one man took it upon himself to collect and write down as many traditional myths as possible and assemble them into a "Chambri Bible," in which the stories are evaluated and literally equated with Christian scriptural myths (Gewertz and Errington 1991:154-68). Most Asabano connect to the new universal mainly by actively rejecting and denying the validity of their traditional religion, attributing it to Satan's deceptions. They point to the difficulties of precontact life, with its endemic cannibalistic warfare and awkward complex of taboos and restricted 101</page><page sequence="10">102 ETHNOLOGY contact between the sexes. As Belok, a semiliterate man, colorfully exclaimed, "We follow the Bible because God made it and gave it to us. If the talk of God weren't here, I'd kill and eat you! We see that since we have followed the Bible we are no longer short of things. So, you hear that? Before we just followed the words of men." Traditional religion created divisions between the Asabano and members of other ethnic groups, for men initiated into the Asabano traditions were not allowed inside some other groups' sacred houses or to be privy to their secret myth versions, and vice versa. Traditional religion also maintained divisions between people of different initiatory statuses within the group. One apparent aspect of Christian universalism that is particularly striking to the Asabano is its relative lack of food taboos, in contrast to those which formerly marked the boundaries between different groups within Asabano society. Christianity is appealing, people say, because God declares in the Bible that as he created everything, all foods are "free" (i.e., available for everyone). "It's true," a young man named Kevin told me. "God made the Earth, pigs, animals . . . everything we know, God made. It's true because they wrote it in the Bible and we can see it. Pastor Wani read this in the Bible and told us, so we think it's true." The written source provides a new charter for social organization that weakens boundaries within and between societies, homogenizing distinctions through universal access to knowledge and the benefits (food, as the local idiom has it) that can be gained through its use. Writing arrived with many other marvelous things controlled by whites. Clearly, the white people had fabulous powers, and they used these powers in ways that the Asabano admired and emulated. Dowasi, who was a boy when the revival began, described a religious experience he had that convinced him of the material benefits of belief in Christianity. I had a vision: the Holy Spirit carried me to a house. I saw a man with white skin, and I thought, "This is the Lord." I was in a big European style house-it was very clean, and this man showed me a room. There were lots of things inside: a bed and blanket, and clothes; and he said, "Whoever believes in me can come here. This is your bed." To Asabano, the Bible is a source not only of truth, but also of practical benefits. This image of Christianity is reminiscent of the promises of wealth that are typical of Melanesian cargo cults (Worsley 1968). Cargoistic thinking follows the logic that if people can learn the methods used by white people, who are often regarded as supernatural beings themselves or as having secret means of communicating with deities to produce wealth, they will also be able to produce wealth (Lawrence 1971). This notion is not so strange as it first appears to Westerners. After all, Christianity does promise rewards to followers, which are naturally imagined in terms of local desires, as Robbins (1995) describes for the Urapmin. The cargo cult as a concept is excessively exoticized (Lindstrom 1993), and fundamentally similar movements exist far beyond what pleases Westerners to call Melanesia (Lohmann 2000a:316).</page><page sequence="11">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO In spite of these caveats, the literature on cargo cults reveals attitudes that develop toward writing in culture contact situations. From such studies, for example, we know that Melanesians observed that whites use writing in the production of goods, and that they attributed to this a supernatural significance. Meggitt (1968:306) notes that across Melanesia, writing was added to seances, divination, and dream interpretation as a means of communicating with supernatural beings to procure health and wealth. White people used written documents such as orders and receipts in procuring goods, and letters sent off resulted in packages from abroad. Introduced currency and coinage, too, bear writing that informs owners and trading partners of specific value, as do bank account statements, checks, and perhaps most promising of all, credit cards (Akin and Robbins 1999; Robbins 1997). Some Asabano have put earnings from occasional work away from home into Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation passbook accounts, where numbers printed on a line in a book bearing people's names signifies their wealth. Wogan (1994) convincingly argues that reports of awe over the power of writing in contact situations have frequently been overdrawn. When magical beliefs about writing do develop, they often derive from people's actual experience with its use by dominant groups to control others (Wogan 1998). Burridge (1995 [1960]:193) notes that though the people he studied in Papua New Guinea were aware that writing is "normally merely a substitute for an oral communication," they saw written words as having additional power, and believed the act of sending a letter in itself produces results. This is a common attitude in Melanesia, and resonates with my experience. I have occasionally received letters from friends in Papua New Guinea asking that I send money or goods. These written requests are sometimes laced with professions of faith and belief that indeed I will answer their letter with a package, as though the letter were a prayer to the Christian God, who demands faith in return for salvation. The Asabano have learned from Western tradition to think that declaring faith produces results, and that writing will be more likely to work its magic if the correct protocol is used. When Melanesians understand how to use writing to acquire what they want, Westerners call it "development" or "business," but whenever the message is somewhat misunderstood, it is labeled "cargoism." Certainly, written messages produce results that the voice cannot. The Asabano believe that every action taken by a person has a spiritual cause. Good behavior is attributed to the "big soul" (identified since conversion with the Holy Spirit) and antisocial behavior is attributed to the "little soul" (identified with Satan). For people operating under such a belief system, written letters are like prayers, and a return letter bearing the requested items seems to prove the point. The Asabano understand the Bible to be a letter from God, making a request of human beings that they believe, and offering in return a payment of an eternal life in which all wants and needs are met. Belief can be expressed to God, the Asabano say, by attending sunrise, sunset, and Sunday church services, and by frequent prayer. A literate young man named Chris explained, 103</page><page sequence="12">104 ETHNOLOGY If you pray all the time He will answer, but if you sin you must really pray a lot. If you pray once He won't help you. He likes people; Christ died on the cross to take away our sins. Prayer is the key. I saw it in the Bible, and the pastors and missionaries told me. People like Wani and Diyos. I believed it-I saw it in the Bible. There are two books in Heaven. One lists all of our sins, and one lists the names of all believers. They are the book of life and the book of death. When we pray a lot God removes a sin from the book. I believed it after I read it. There are, as it were, spiritual census books in the sky, in which debits and credits toward salvation are listed like numbers in a savings account passbook. The payback from God is promised in his letter to people as well. Meki, another young literate man of Daksil hamlet, when asked whether he believed that God will answer prayers, replied, "Yes I think that's a fact; it's true. I myself read it in the Bible. John 14:14 says if you are short of anything and you pray to God, He will help you. Before I could read I heard it from Pastor Wani, and Mr. Diyos. Before I wasn't sure if it was true or false, but after I went to school and learned, I could read and saw that it's a fact." This verse, to which Meki and many others often referred, actually reads in the Tok Pisin Bible, "Olgeta samting yupela i askim long nem bilong mi, bai mi mekim, "which can be translated as, "Everything you ask for in my name, I will do." The NIV Bible version reads, "You may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it." This is the contract offered by Christianity as the Asabano understand it; in fact, they use that term in Tok Pisin to refer to the deal: a written agreement, issued directly from the deity to humankind, accessible by people forever after by virtue of its verbatim storage in scripture. YOUTH LITERACY AND RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY By corroborating what missionaries said was contained in the Bible, belief in Christianity was strengthened, and a process of democratization of religion among the Asabano began. Wani, the local pastor, was among the first to become literate as a student at the local Bible college founded in 1974 by Diyos, the chief missionary to the area. A handful of children went to nearby Oksapmin Community School after it opened in 1968, and returned to their villages with rudimentary reading abilities. In 1987, a community school was opened locally, and Asabano parents sent many boys and girls to study there. These schools offer a grade-six education in English and Tok Pisin. Starting in 1993, several Asabano students were sent to neighboring Telefomin to attend high school, from seventh to ninth grade, where they gained greater fluency in English and Tok Pisin reading and writing. Reading the Bible, these young people were able to find references to myths that pastors had told them earlier and to make new discoveries of their own. Jim said, I myself read it [the creation myth] in Genesis, and I believe all the pastors. Diyos, Wani, some big men from Mount Hagen who came and preached here, and my own reading of the Bible convinced me. I believed these men because they looked in the Bible and then preached, and we also looked in the Bible and saw what they said was there.</page><page sequence="13">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO Learning to read provided Asabano youths access to mystic revelations, but religious experiences have elsewhere also been known to inspire new scripts. Turner (1979:124) reports that members of the Obere Okaime Church in Nigeria developed a new language and script, attributed to Holy Spirit revelations. Schools were set up to teach them until the government and popular pressure shut them down. Many Asabano elders are filled with wonder when they consider the source of writing and the lingua franca of Tok Pisin (see Kulick 1992:160-89 on mystical connections seen elsewhere in Papua New Guinea between Tok Pisin, writing, and Western affluence). Baraiab, who was fully initiated into traditional religious secrets before Christianity came, described how he came to reject the Asabano origin myth and embrace the "story of Eve and Adam": My father told me [the Asabano origin myth] and I thought it was true and followed this story. Now I've left this, and practice new customs. I've changed my belief and my thoughts. Before we had many languages, but now we've got Tok Pisin which is spoken all over the world, so I think this old explanation isn't true. I just follow the new man [Jesus]; I don't know about the truth of these [traditional myths]. Now I think they're just a falsehood. The white men came, plus the talk of God is true. Our stories are just false. Before we had to work hard planting cordyline [for garden magic] but food was still short. Then I heard the talk of God, that this was just a lie. Now we follow this and pray only and the garden grows well. Now the missionaries and white men told us we have to leave these things. It's a false god. I didn't believe them at first, but when I saw the food still grow [after traditional rituals were discontinued] I believed it. The first man to tell me about God was the Telefolmin pastor Malon. Next, Diyos. Third, Wasinau [Diyos's brother]-when these three talked I had two feelings, they were either lying or telling the truth-we were afraid they were tricking us to kill us. Then Wani talked. Wani is my brother; he himself told me, "Our father told us a falsehood. We are brothers, so you must come along." I thought he was right. Wani talked about this all the time and I absorbed it. Later, the young people read the Bible and I heard them and I thought it was true. A middle-aged mother named Waloko also recognized the situation in which her juniors are literate and must be regarded as the most capable of retrieving religious knowledge from its storehouse, the Bible. "We parents don't know [how to read], but the schoolchildren and those who can read taught us this is in the Bible. Wani told us. Also, Diyos told us. The [Holy] Spirit makes me believe it's true." Only a small percentage of Asabano are literate, and virtually all regard the Bible as an enormously powerful collection of mythological truths. Nonetheless, there is no tendency to restrict access to it by limiting literacy, the number of Bibles in the community, or access of the illiterate to the Bible's power. Even those who have only the barest literacy make use of writing as a new form of prayer. The sick, who are understood to be the victims of nature spirits or cannibal witches, seek the assistance of God when a wooden cross inscribed with a Bible verse is planted in the path supposed to have been taken by the supernatural culprit. Gewertz and Errington (1991:149) point out that in Papua New Guinea, writing is valued as a powerful source of validation for claims. They were frequently asked to produce written documents for such purposes. I had similar experiences, ranging 105</page><page sequence="14">106 ETHNOLOGY from requests for typed letters documenting the faithful service of translators to genealogies and traditional stories linking the Asabano with nearby territory under mining exploration in the hope of securing royalty rights. Democratic access to scriptural power does not automatically follow from the introduction of written religion. For example, similar conditions produced an opposite strategy in Northern Ghana, where, according to Goody (1968b), access to the Koran was severely limited because of the mystical power derived from concealing the meaning of the written word. A similar outcome might have occurred among the Asabano if not for the prevailing Melanesian egalitarian ethos and the imported Christian idea that the benefits of biblical knowledge can only be had when it is openly shared. This allowed for a transition from a closed to an open religious society. Older men have allowed their power as exclusive bearers and transmitters of secret-sacred knowledge to be dissipated mainly because Christianity's ideal of extending equal access to religious knowledge allowed elders' participation in spite of their illiteracy. By contrast, indigenous religion was based on secret knowledge and the power implicated by this knowledge was understood to derive in part from secrecy itself (Bercovitch 1989, 1994; Herdt 1990:369; Jorgensen 1981). By selectively sharing religious knowledge at initiations or with individuals deemed to be ready, while withholding other information, personal prestige and an aura of power are preserved. Christianity's power also derives from knowledge; however, the beliefs do not depend on restricted access or secrecy for their power. The source of religious knowledge and power is scripture. This is particularly true in the Protestant tradition, in which all congregants are encouraged to consult the Bible themselves insofar as possible. In the proselytizing ethic of Christianity it is wrong to withhold the "good news" from others. Religious secrecy would be seen as sinful, dooming the unenlightened to eternal damnation and jeopardizing one's own chance for salvation. In the conversion to Baptist Christianity, the contents of the Bible have been recited and discussed openly with all; thus older men did not suffer a loss of access to religious power. They did lose their former exclusive access to religious knowledge, and the prerogative to determine what sacred knowledge will be passed on to others. However, this loss was richly compensated, as they share in the perceived increase in actual and promised prosperity that is the benefit of the new, public religious knowledge. While elder men cannot directly read the Bible, they need not worry that literate people will keep the religious knowledge and power contained in it from them because such secrecy, in the new religion, would be self-defeating. To be an illiterate is not to be isolated from the power of Christianity or of scripture. For example, an elderly woman named Maka reported that in her dreams the Holy Spirit declared that, in spite of her illiteracy, she should acquire a Bible and a pen. She admitted she found the Spirit's request strange, but felt strongly that simply having these materials was a spiritual imperative, and asked me to buy them for her. Elsewhere in Papua New Guinea, illiterate people have even used</page><page sequence="15">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO ethnographies for magic and prayer (Gewertz and Errington 1991:153). A written document can be appreciated as a powerful symbol that can be called upon to induce responses from the human and supernatural world, regardless of one's ability or experience in actually reading it. When writing and written religion are introduced, relationships of enculturation are altered. Written myth or scripture takes on an appealing verbatim exactitude. However, it can only be accessed through books, and therefore to directly encounter written spiritual voices one must first learn to read. The literate surpass the illiterate as respected cultural transmitters of scriptural myth. Those skilled in the new technology are usually young, and they take on a prominent role as interpreters and teachers. Elders, who are generally more important as teachers because of their experience and traditional knowledge, are replaced by the educated youth as reputable sources of useful information. Normally culture is transmitted from elder to junior, but especially in cases of rapid innovation or diffusion, the younger teach the older. Worldwide, cultural information is increasingly stored and transmitted using technological media such as writing and audiovisual recordings, resulting in altered social dynamics in fields of access, control, and perishability of information. For example, the effect of the digital information revolution on social life has much in common with the introduction of other ways of manipulating information in culture contact situations. Elders in Western societies sometimes feel overwhelmed by new computer information technologies, and bypassed by their grandchildren as sources of information in favor of the Internet. In spite of this, few elders seem to feel that the new technology can or should be rejected, because of the benefits that it provides for all. Instead, new patterns of authority and expertise develop, as only the young are able to pass on new knowledge. A similar pattern can be observed among the Asabano of central New Guinea, one of the last peoples in the world to be contacted by Western civilization, as they confront the arrival of writing and Christianity. CONCLUSION Writing is a remarkable technology, and the printed word gives followers of scriptural religions a profound advantage in proselytizing and winning converts over large sections of the earth and in maintaining their beliefs in relatively stable form so long as their texts are preserved and access to them is granted, as Goody (2000) points out. However, I disagree with Goody when he writes: You cannot convert to an oral religion-you become a member of the political system (a "tribe") and you subscribe, to a greater or lesser degree, to the beliefs of the group. Conversion implies a different definition of religion, commitment to a fixed text (beliefs and rituals), and it involves giving up one set of practices and beliefs in favor of another. (Goody 2000:106) Goody goes on to argue, using the example of the Asante, that religions in oral cultures have no such thing as a canon, because they have "no such formal boundaries" and "the religion is constituted by whatever everyone does" (Goody 107</page><page sequence="16">108 ETHNOLOGY 2000:122-23). However, as Rappaport (1999:52-54, 105-06) discusses in detail, all religions have a canon in the form of key ideas, beliefs, and rituals that are more stable and public than self-referential ritual messages that declare a person's state at a given moment. Though in oral societies much religious content may in fact change rapidly, it is often perceived as fixed (Keen 1994). The outer forms or signifiers of central canons are multivocal key symbols and are often quite stable, even when the details of what they signify vary (Turner 1967). This is true of both written and oral religious traditions. People can use these signifiers, which are simple enough to be transmitted orally with relatively high fidelity, to identify themselves as members of a group, and may reject one and adopt another, changing their affiliation and converting to another orally transmitted religion. Conversion often occurs for individually pragmatic reasons, but canonical elements of doctrine are later called upon as a justification. As Nutini (2000:42) finds among ex-Catholic converts to native evangelism in Mexico, "with the fervor characteristic of all converts, the original reasons for conversion are still there but take subsidiary importance to doctrinal reasons: the latter, in a sense, become a rationalization of the former." I have argued here that it was not the introduction of writing per se, but rather the imported ideology of open access to religious knowledge and its supposed fruits, including those that can be secured through writing, that aided the Asabano conversion to Christianity. While conversion may require some symbol or canon to serve as a focus for identity to which the convert self-consciously adheres, this central focus need not take the form of a written text. Any religious system, oral or written, can have a sufficient constellation of beliefs and practices to be recognized as a marker of religious and/or ethnic identity. A central canon of Asabano traditional religion was the secrecy involved in myth and ritual: the careful control of religious knowledge that was thought necessary to produce food, literally and figuratively. From the Asabano perspective, an appealing canon of Christianity is, unlike Asabano traditional religion, its openness in myth and ritual. It is a religion that is almost too good to be true, for it seems to produce food through actively disclosing, rather than meticulously guarding, religious knowledge. The disclosure of sacred knowledge is made even easier by the presence of Bibles which, unlike old men, are identical, do not die, and tell all their secrets freely to the literate. The effect of a new technology of cultural storage and transmission (writing) and a scripture-based religion (Baptist Christianity) on a previously oral society (the Asabano) illustrates why Christianity succeeds in places like Melanesia. When informationally open religions like Christianity are introduced to societies practicing secretive religious traditions, not only those dispossessed in the old system stand to gain access to religious power. The privileged keepers of traditional secret knowledge also benefit by equally sharing access to the apparently even greater power offered by the new religion. In nonliterate societies, religious knowledge is gained by participating in rituals and by hearing myths and stories. Even where there is no tradition of secrecy, individuals will have differing levels of command of the local corpus of religious</page><page sequence="17">WRITING AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE ASABANO knowledge, creating categories or groups of novices and adepts who must remain in training to gain satisfactory knowledge. Where writing and a scripture-based religion have been introduced, novices wishing to get religious knowledge from the original source must devote significant effort simply to developing competence in the medium of instruction. When it is impossible for all members of a society to become proficient in reading and writing, literate and illiterate groups will come into existence. Christianity and other scripture-based religions have spread to many people before converts became literate, largely because the illiterate can hear scripture through its oral recitation and discussion. Indeed, the oral performance of scripture is a vital element of written religion that is too easily overlooked (Graham 1987). However, listening to others reciting and describing scripture involves trusting the interpreter as honestly translating the visual to the aural. This trust had to be won by the missionaries when they first arrived, and was earned through their continued goodwill and the apparent power of Christianity to maintain garden fertility. Baraiab's younger brother Wani was trustworthy by virtue of kinship. Later, relatives in his children's and grandchildren's generation could read the Bible themselves and through their interpretations extend his knowledge of biblical mythology. Those who under Christendom are his teachers would have been his inferiors under the traditional religion. He would, as an Asabano man, have distrusted and fought with the missionaries as foreigners, and, as a religious leader, would have initiated and educated the juniors of his group. Following conversion, because they can read and have no reason to hide the religious knowledge they acquire from him, he easily trusts and defers to their superior knowledge that he might increase his own. Among peoples like the Asabano, to whom literacy has recently been introduced or who are not universally literate, writing as a medium of culture can serve as a separating force in societies just as secretive religious systems do. Those who are literate can have direct access to information that the illiterate lack. Like members of a secret society, the literate may decide with whom to share the knowledge to which they are privy. However, this can be overcome when those who can read are motivated to share the written knowledge they acquire with those who cannot read. The older men lost their exclusive position as religious experts, but because of Christianity's characteristics, they retain an equal share of religion's apparent bounty. With the advent of Christian hegemony over Papua New Guinea, then, Asabano elders submitted to what they saw as a great power, coming not from their ancestors, but from the universal source. They felt helpless to control this source themselves, for it came from outside, where everyone had, it seemed, already come to accept it. They also saw that it did not require secrecy to be effective. Rather, according to Christian doctrine, it derived more power from being spread as widely as possible. The old men lost their status as ritual experts, but gained participation in a movement that promised paradise, if not in this world, then after death. 109</page><page sequence="18">110 ETHNOLOGY NOTES 1.
