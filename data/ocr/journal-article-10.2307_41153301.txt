<plain_text><page sequence="1">Visual Field in Beckett's Late Plays Stanton B. Garner, Jr. Samuel Beckett, we know, is an author deeply interested in the visual arts. A frequenter of museums, "more at home in the company of painters than that of writers," he has revealed this passion through a wealth of textual allusions. 1 But Beckett's temperament is more profoundly visual than the study of influ- ence might suggest, his investigation of the visual image more original and direct. To appreciate this directness, we look to the plays, for the theater's dual status as literary and visual medium allows Beckett to counterpoint his exploration of language with a parallel study of vision, as it is actualized within the theatrical mise-en-scène. Few dramatists have assumed such control over the theatrical image, the arrangement of its elements and the articulation of its form. The minimalist stage specifications of Waiting for Godot ("A country road. A tree." [p. 6a]) 2 relin- quish much to the discretion of director and designer, but with Endgame Beckett appropriated a supervision of stage image that he has retained throughout his dramatic career and exer- cised with a painter's sensitivity to visual composition. 3 Framed in tableau, the opening set of this play represents a performance field conceived with pictorial precision: its contours boldly rectangular, with walls, door, symmetrical windows, and re- versed picture; its frontal plane laterally weighted by the trash bins and the stationary figure of Clov, both flanking the centric chair covered with an old sheet. Coherent in its spatial con- ception, the set of Endgame opposes two visual principles: on one hand, a geometric strictness of line and plane, arranged with an almost chessboard regularity of grid; and, on the other hand, the entropie scatteredness of object (toque, rug, toy dog, gaff), the muting grey light, and the bent shapelessness of human STANTON B.

He has published articles on medieval, renaissance, and modern drama, and has recently completed a study entitled The Absent Voice: Narrative Comprehen- sion in the Theater. 349</page><page sequence="2">350 Comparative Drama form. As Clov and Hamm traverse this stage space in straight lines and right angles, they define themselves within the com- positional tensions of their visual world. Beckett's subsequent career as a dramatist has shown a deepening of this attention to the theatrical image and to its specifically visual components and effects. Through Krapp's Last Tape, Play y and Come and Go, Beckett's specifications concern- ing location, formal arrangement, movement, and lighting be- come increasingly detailed, fixing the performance image more precisely as compositional entity. But it is in the plays of the 70's and 80's that Beckett's interest in play as image - as structure of visual forces and object of perceptual activity - displays itself most acutely. Language continues to govern the aural and imaginative dimensions of these plays, but these dimensions, and the eddying stream of Beckett's words, are increasingly subordinated to visual modes of address. The late plays as a group are filled with references to eyes and to the shapes and colors of visual appearance, while their verbs often mirror the audience's own attempts to see: look, watch, see, observe, stare, peer, gaze, gape, "all the eyes passing over you." "[T]here before your eyes," says one of the voices in That Time (p. 229), and his phrase is one of many in late Beckett that call attention to the performance image of something seen, by an actual audience facing an actual stage, within a medium that is, etymologically, a "seeing-place" (theatron). It is telling, in this respect, that the texts of Beckett's late plays abandon the conventional designations of "stage left" and "stage right" for descriptions that specify location "as seen from house9' (What Where, p. 310), thereby establishing the theatrical image from the audience's point of view. This article will explore some of the principles governing the organization of visual field in Beckett's eight theater pieces from Not I (1972) through What Where (1983). Rather than considering these plays sequentially (as Enoch Brater has ably done in his recent study Beyond Minimalism) ,4 I will consider the more important features of the performance image - shape, light, darkness, color, movement, depth, lateral arrangement - suggesting principles of visual articulation and arrangement that govern the late plays as a group. Such principles, I hope, will contribute to a "visual poetics" for these remarkable plays, one able to describe Beckett's increasingly complex use of perfor- mance space. Despite their variety, these plays make similar use</page><page sequence="3">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 351 of the elements of visual field, organizing them toward effects of tension, imbalance, and instability that give Beckett's most recent work for the stage its consistency as well as its distinctive visual animation. Animation is at the heart of this study, for visual field in Beckett's late plays is anything but static, and even plays such as That Time and A Piece of Monologue, one finds, counterpoint the virtual absence of explicit action with a striking complexity of compositional action. Visual field is, above all else, perceptual field, and it manipulates the intricate activities of what Rudolf Arnheim calls "the creative eye,"5 active in its scanning of visual percepts, rich in its experience of compositional balances and tensions. Like a Braque or a Dali, Beckett charges his theatrical material with a peculiarly modern dynamism: a celebration of subversion and imbalance; a height- ening of expectation through its frustration; a yearning toward resolution, which hovers as an almost forgotten echo. It is this dynamism, in Beckett's late plays, that engages his spectators at their most immediate level of apprehension - the level, prior to comprehension, when the perceiving subject encounters and seeks to organize its visual environment. To explore the tech- niques of visual organization in Beckett's most recent work - uses of the stage that represent departures, as well as intensifica- tions, of earlier techniques - is to reveal an intimate dimension of the interaction between Beckett's stage and its audience and to uncover a particularly rich avenue of theatrical meaning.6 I Visual Articulation. Any discussion of visual field in Beckett's recent plays must acknowledge the striking predominance of geometric form, an emphasis on shape that endows visual objects and the performance image they comprise with a high level of compositional abstraction. As theatrical setting is reduced to a spareness of basic outline (the rectangular table in Ohio Im- promptu, the spherical globe and quadrilateral pallet edge in A Piece of Monologue, the illuminated strip in Footfalls, the circular spots of light in Not I and That Time), visual field acquires an almost classical simplicity of form, relinquishing the anthropomorphic signatures of "inhabited space" for the aes- thetic surface of visual abstraction. Those vestiges of naturalism that assert themselves within the setting (the rocking chair in Rockaby, the director's chair in Catastrophe, the book in Ohio Impromptu, the megaphone in What Where) seem mocked by</page><page sequence="4">352 Comparative Drama the essentially formal space that surrounds them, and they gradually surrender their utilitarian value for the more strictly aesthetic value of shape. In keeping with this increasingly formal conception of the mise-en-scène in Beckett's late plays, characters are themselves objectified as aesthetic components of the visual field, reduced from person to figure, or less, "as though turned to stone" or other inanimate matter (Ohio Impromptu, p. 287). The djell- abas, dressing gowns, nightgowns, wraps, and coats with which Beckett dresses these protagonists streamline the visual irregu- larities of the human shape, subsuming the individuating features of the body into a marionette-like broadness of form, while the anatomical reduction in plays such as Not I and That Time further diminishes figurai irregularity, pressing the anthropo- morphic features of mouth and head into the visual features of bordered hole and ovalJ Insofar as these characters often possess little more than outline and shape, the geometry of figure forms part of the larger geometry of field and contributes to a per- formance image that is at once sculptural and pictorial. From this perspective, the quasi-naturalistic Catastrophe reflects with- in its own development the visual progression of Beckett's dramatic oeuvre from its earliest to its latest phases. Opening with the furniture of a recognizable room, surrounded on three sides by naturalistic walls, Catastrophe dramatizes (in part) the falling away of naturalistic space in favor of the more formal space represented by the Protagonist, ''standing on a black block 18 inches high" "[a]ge and physique unimportant" (p. 297). As the lighting narrows successively to figure, then head, and the Director and Assistant are banished to darkness and to the wings, human shape gives way to the more abstract Shape of a face freed from its moorings, floating as visual em- blem in the stage's blackness. 8 In terms of visual outlines, then, Beckett's is a performance image with conflicting perceptual inclinations, caught between a theater of human figures in personalized settings and the depersonalizing outlines of abstract shape. Reinforced by the voices that they speak and hear, the figures in these plays assert themselves as characters with recognizable human identity: the Protagonist's stare at the end of Catastrophe challenges the Director's formal conception of the human figure with a face that is chillingly alive. But such gestures on the part of Beckett's late characters are challenged, in large part, by the surrounding</page><page sequence="5">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 353 field and by the world of circles and quadrilaterals to which their own regularized shape joins them. Mouth, May, the Wo- man in Rockaby, and the figures of What Where may assert themselves against this pervasive reduction, but the very attempt only underscores their subordination within a world of visual abstraction. Like an optical illusion, or like the perceptual conflicts achieved in cubist art, Beckett's visual field oscillates uneasily between the naturalistic and the formal, between a world of recognizable objects and figures and a world of height- ened shape. It is a world where a table is both itself and an illuminated rectangle {''say 8' x 4* " [Ohio Impromptu, p. 285]) and where a Mouth is both an organ of human speech and a "godforsaken hole" (Not I, p. 216). To speak of shape in Beckett's drama is, inescapably, to speak of light, for Beckett makes unprecedented use of stage light as an active, even aggressive, determinant of the theatrical image. From the inquisitorial beam of light in Not I through the "'f]aint diffuse light" of A Piece of Monologue (p. 265), Beckett's stage light participates as actively in the definition of theatrical shape as it does in the delivery of speech in the earlier Play. Scored by Beckett's meticulous stage specifications like the dynamics and phrasing within a musical composition, light offers the primary articulation of the mise-en-scène and estab- lishes (through its illumination) the spatial presence of the visual object. It is the harsh reflection of light that gives the white deal table such striking predominance in Ohio Impromptu, while the rectangular playing area (P) of What Where owes its existence entirely to the light that defines it within the sur- rounding "shadow" (p. 310). Light provides location and out- line for Mouth, Listener (in That Time), the chalklike Speaker, and the conic V. As Not I demonstrates, so authoritative is stage light as a determinant of visual form in Beckett's late plays that it dominates the human figure itself, modifying - even deform- ing - the body's own shape through restricted and partial illu- mination. In Footfalls, Beckett subjects May to the visual distortions produced by uneven lighting: feet are drawn into the lit sphere of the walking strip while head and upper body are pressed into near invisibility. With similar intrusion, light seems to sever the head of the Woman in Rockaby (like that of Listener in That Time or the Protagonist in Catastrophe), then maintains it in a state of consistent illumination while successive fades cause chair and body to recede.9</page><page sequence="6">354 Comparative Drama Light, then, serves as an agent within and for Beckett's performance image; indeed, as it carves illuminated space from the surrounding darkness, it approaches the status of visual object in its own right. By endowing light itself with visual substance, Beckett allows unprecedented weight to a component of the theatrical medium frequently relegated to disattention. Beckett establishes a parallel effect with that opposite compo- nent of theatrical space, the darkness where light does not penetrate. Darkness, of course, is a conventional "non-space" in theatrical performance - a region of absence that borders illum- ination, endowing wings, backstage, and audience with a kind of perceptual anonymity. But darkness in Beckett's late plays is tangible, and it asserts its materiality as part of the visual field. Through the sharp focus of its illuminations and the minimalist images it defines, light throws into relief the darkness around it, the comparative vastness of the "non-seen" (stage not seen, bodies not seen, space left blank) that bears upon the image in its incandescence. Darkness, in Beckett's theater, frames illumination, and in terms of its sheer predominance in plays such as Not I and Rockaby it acquires pressing visual weight as though it shared substance with the black costumes so frequent in Beckett's late plays. In this respect, Beckett brings to per- formance space a quality more typical of the art of painting, where the color black shares pigment, stroke, and contour with the color white. When the Speaker of A Piece of Monologue alludes to his fictional counterpart, staring from the edge of lamplight "[i]nto dark whole again" (p. 268), his play on words captures the paradoxical and innovative fullness of Beckettian stage darkness. This heightened plasticity of light and darkness has pro- nounced visual consequences for Beckett's performance image. In striking counterpoint to the traditional subordination of theatrical elements, ground becomes figure as the conditions within which theatrical objects acquire or fail to acquire visi- bility themselves become centers of theatrical attention, quasi- objects with their own visual presence and weight. In contrast to the frequent passivity of visual ground in dramatic represen- tation, light and darkness in these plays display overt perceptual dynamism, for they interact with each other as competing entities within given visual fields. In certain plays, the two perceptual forces confront each other as Manichaean absolutes, challenging each other across their shared interfaces with the</page><page sequence="7">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 355 boldness of their contrast, invading each other in a chiaroscuro often as violent as that achieved by El Greco. We have already considered some of the raids perpetrated by light upon darkness: the sharp illuminations of figure in Not I and That Time, the spot-severance of head in Rockaby and Catastrophe. But dark- ness reappropriates territory within these plays of pointed con- trast: it fills the Mouth in Not I, suggesting a cavern of visual night, as it filled the Woman's sunken eyes in Billie Whitelaw's Rockaby. Perhaps nowhere are the confrontational dynamics of light and darkness more apparent than in Ohio Impromptu, a play scored in terms of these visual poles. The white hair of Reader and Listener join the white deal table top as areas of glaring brightness, luminous to the point of burning with their reflection of the overhead light (an invasion of light so strong that the figures seem to protect themselves from it by shielding their brows with their hands). But darkness mounts a number of counterassaults on the image claimed by light: through the shaded foreheads; the black coats that separate heads from table; the underside, which denies the table its legs and causes it to float, as if unattached, within stage space; and, most strikingly of all, the black wide-brimmed hat at table center, which (viewed from the audience's lateral angle of vision) causes darkness to invade the illuminated plane from above and to exert a counter-push to the upward reflection. Such confrontations, however, and the vivid polarities that make them possible, are exceptions in late Beckett. Bright light is much more regularly the property of earlier plays such as Happy Days {"Blazing light" [p. 7]) and Act Without Words I ("Dazzling light" [p. 43]); and sharp dichotomies of light and dark more overt in Act Without Words U, Krapp9 s Last Tape, and Play .10 Come and Go and Breath (and segments of Play) signal a transition to a use of light much more characteristic of the late plays as a group: the modulation of brightness within a middle region, neither fully bright nor fully dark. Under the heading "MAXIMUM LIGHT," Beckett's directions for Breath contain the following specification: "Not bright. If 0=dark and 10=bright, light should move from about 3 to 6 and back" (p. 21 1 ) . Such "middle light" hearkens back to the "'g'rey light" of Endgame (p. 1), but it more fully sounds the keynote of the late plays, which are characterized by "faint," "dim," "diffuse," "subdued" light that only imperfectly illuminates the objects and inhabitants of the mise-en-scène.</page><page sequence="8">356 Comparative Drama "Half-light," which plays an important role in the perceptual animation of the late plays, is characterized by a curious dy- namism in the theater. The Speaker in A Piece of Monologue alludes to "[g]rey light" (p. 268) and thus recalls Beckett's television play Ghost Trio (1975) with its scale of greys: "The color grey if you wish, shades of the color grey."H But the greyness of theatrical half-light differs markedly from the grey- ness of the photographic or telegraphic image. The muted greys of Ghost Trio mediate between the poles of black and white, establishing in their neutrality the softness of visual rest. In the theater, on the other hand, the perception of light is determined much more rigorously by the poles of "normal" light and dark- ness and by the oppositional tensions between them. Unlike black-and-white televisual space, which is governed by the screen's fluorescent greyness, theatrical space is inhabited space, and like the world outside the theater it is conditioned by the brightness polarities of day and night. In such an environment, half-light occupies an unstable middle ground, uneasily poised between the more familiar poles of illumination. From the slight dimming of Mouth's spotlight to the more radically faint lighting of What Where, diminished lighting feels unnatural precisely because illumination and darkness constitute such a strong theatrical duality and occasion such pronounced visual expectations. The very language of Beckett's specifications - "faint," "dim," "barely visible"- -underscores the aberrational effect of such lighting and the polarity that makes it so. The oppositional tension of light and dark achieved in Ohio Impromptu, then, is not eliminated in the spectral plays of ghostly half-light; it is replaced by tension of a different order. Hovering between poles that it refuses to embrace, the dimin- ished lighting in Beckett's late plays occasions perceptual insta- bility, simultaneously approaching and resisting the extremes of full illumination and the absence of light. Half-light shares both light and darkness, and this dual loyalty gives Beckett's stage perceptual disequilibrium, with space and the elements that inhabit it striving, in their muted articulation, towards opposing states of visual rest. To the extent that the pulls of illumination and extinguishment make themselves felt, Beckett's "[h]ellish half-light" (Play, p. 152) is light divided within itself. Beckett heightens the instability of this mutual infusion - light with darkness, darkness with light- through the techniques of fade-in and fade-out that serve to reveal and extinguish the</page><page sequence="9">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 357 field of illumination. In the earlier plays, Beckett employs the more abrupt framing devices of curtain and light switch to heighten the appearance of tableau as well as the visual dis- continuity between illuminated image and theatrical darkness; against the abrupt bracketing, each maintains its perceptual autonomy. The slow fade-ins that open most of the late plays, on the other hand, underscore the gradual emergence of object and light from the surrounding darkness, while the concluding fade-outs emphasize their inevitable surrender. At both ends, the image crosses a gradient of illumination, modulating between light and darkness in a way that underscores their mutual interpénétration. To frame the dramatic object in this way is to consign it simultaneously to both realms - to make it a kind of visual "ghost," caught in its emergence from one perceptual world to another, wandering within the middle registers of light. Beckett achieves this effect upon the visual image even within Ohio Impromptu and Catastrophe, plays otherwise organized according to the sharper opposition of darkness and light: fade-in (in Ohio Impromptu) demonstrates the slow emergence of visual clarity, while fade-out (in both) dramatizes its dis- appearance, as stage darkness slowly corrodes the articulations of brightness. Of the plays that combine fade techniques with an overall half-light, few engineer the gradual shift of light intensity with more intricacy than Footfalls, a play that constitutes a study in shade and that sounds its visual melodies against the fluidity of light's farthest reaches. When stable, even its half-light is gra- dated - "dim, strongest at floor level, less on body, least on head* (p. 239) - suggesting in its shadings from one brightness level to another both the imperceptibility of distinction and the instability of individual brightness level. Fade-in and fade-out underscore this variability, modulating the image across the borders of obscurity: initially illuminated through a gradual fade-up, the play's visual field undergoes a sequence of slow returns to darkness, and slow re-emergences, each to an even more reduced brightness level {"Fade up to a little less still on strip" [p. 240]). In the concluding image, the figure May has disappeared, and all that remains is a light barely perceptible in the surrounding darkness. On the level of narrative, the play concerns May, her place among the voices and stories that fill the stage, the spectral consciousness of this figure who will never "have done . . . revolving it all" (p. 240). But on the more</page><page sequence="10">358 Comparative Drama immediate perceptual level, Footfalls is a drama of light, of its insistent though diminishing attempts to define figure and space, and of the imperceptible shadings which merge it with darkness. May's movement, both solemn and delicate, joins in the broader choreography of light; through her participation within the play's visual field, May shares the modulations of light's middle region, and she partakes of its diminishment to that point of "lessness" where it can no longer sustain her theatrical presence. 12 So pivotal is the interplay of darkness and light in Beckett's late plays, and so dominant the black-and-white continuum, that color plays a distinctly secondary role in the theatrical image. Compared to the hues of conventional performance, Beckett's is a strikingly colorless drama, relinquishing the artist's and designer's palette for the opposition of black and white and the intermediacy of grey. Hair, clothing, props, set - all are conceived according to this austere scale. The coats of Ru, Vi, and Flo are muted by Beckett's description - "dull violet (Ru), dull red (Vi), dull yellow (Flo)" (p. 196)- and when Beckett directed his own production of Come and Go in 1966 he further reduced the garments to different shades of grey. 13 Even the human complexion presents risks for Beckett's stage worlds: "Like that cranium?" Assistant asks Director in Catastrophe. "Needs whitening," comes the answer (p. 299). Alan Schneider's decision, in his 1984 New York production of Catastrophe, to fill Beckett's uncharacteristically open setting direction with a red armchair provided a performance image startlingly (and playfully) un-Beckettian in its assertion of color. Jane Alison Hale's observation concerning Eh Joe ( 1965) characterizes all of Beckett's plays since Happy Days: "color belongs to the past, and the dying universe of his dying character turns to a uniform grey before we lose sight of it."l4 There is color, of course, within these plays, and we must not neglect its disruption of the black-and-white scale: the pale wood alternately soft and gleaming as it rocks within the field of light in Rockaby: the red and pink of lips and tongue, glisten- ing with moisture, set off by the whiteness of teeth in Not I; the blue, green, or brown of an iris in That Time; the slightly golden tinge of hair in Ohio Impromptu; the frequent flesh-tones of pink and peach, maintaining visual autonomy despite the Director's attempts to "whiten" human skin. But when color threatens in Beckett, it is carefully muted, its singularity of hue strictly minimized. As with so much else in these late plays, the</page><page sequence="11">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 359 color represented by these isolated appearances is of a certain order, inhabiting a middle region of imperfect articulation. For one thing, the very dominance of the black-and-white continuum serves to dull what little color there is in these plays towards its monochromatic scale. The flesh tones of Reader and Listener, for instance, gravitate perceptually toward the white that sub- jugates the set, represented with glaring predominance in table and hair. In coordination with the darkening effects of shadow on the lowered faces, this influence endows natural skin hues with a pallor, pressing color toward the grey that the set seems to require. A more pronounced "greying'* can be observed in those plays that shroud color in the muting obscurity of half- light. Mouth's lips and tongue, for instance, project a color midway between red, brown, and grey in the "faintly lit" stage world of Not I; and the same features of the Speaker's face in A Piece of Monologue display, parsimoniously, what is almost a memory of color. As with the illumination of half-light itself, color in these plays is unstably poised between the poles of full exposure and full elimination, uncertain in its visual assertion. Beckett's performance field may reach toward black and white, while recalling a world of reds, greens, and blues, but it falls short of both. The promises of color and its absence that reach out so teasingly further consign Beckett's performance image to that no-man's land of "not quite." n Visual Arrangement. To explore visual arrangement in the theater is in general to consider two factors: location and movement. More precisely, it is to explore location as a function of movement, continually modified by the rearranging effects of character mobility. In most plays, visual field shifts through the pattern of entrances and exits as well as through the chang- ing visual dynamics of individual, duo, and group; while in plays such as Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken, Ionesco's The Chairs, and Shepard's True West, movement, and its accom- panying actions, effect visual rearrangement of the stage setting itself. Even within the reduced worlds of Waiting for Godot and Endgame, movement determines spatial arrangement as something volatile, self-transforming - a manifestation often closer to the visual fluidity of dance than to the stable surface of the painter's canvas. As with so many other features of the performance image,</page><page sequence="12">360 Comparative Drama Beckett reverses the conventional hierarchies of movement and location in his more recent theater pieces. Extending the princi- ple developed in Happy Days, in Play, and in the ashcan-bound Nagg and Nell of Endgame, Beckett subordinates movement to position and thus circumscribes motion within the bounds of invariant location. The effect, far from transforming the per- formance image, is to confirm the fixity of position within that image. Not that movement is insignificant to the visual worlds of Beckett's late plays; on the contrary, the very reduction and circumscription of mobility that characterizes these plays pro- vides the theatrical image with focal points of movement and gesture. Rocking back and forth through the stage light with a sway that modulates frontal angle as it scatters the reflections of light, the Woman in Rockaby displays a continually shifting visual presence. The tortured efforts of speech, as the elastic Mouth snaps open and shut in what amounts to a diminished danse macabre*, the pinpointed opening and closing of eyes in That Time; the lifting and lowering of arms in Ohio Impromptu, balletic in their slowness as though moving through water - by banishing inessentials of action, Beckett heightens the visual weight of activity and makes gesture and movement dramatic in their own right with more powerful claims on attention. But the visual force of such movement is inseparable from its constraint and - like the gestures of Balinese dance - from the restricted range within which it is allowed. Mouth's gyra- tions, the opening and closing of Listener's eyes, even the rocking motion all take place within severely circumscribed boundaries and serve to fix the image of movement firmly within the visual field as a whole. As a result, the "poetry of moving images"15 in Beckett's late plays involves a "motion within stillness," thus confirming in its relative fixity the spatial geometry of the broader performance image. Movement, in a sense, is frozen within the visual configurations of mise-en-scène, and it offers strikingly little effect upon the outlines of this field. With its concessions to naturalism, Catastrophe constitutes an exception to this rule, for the cross-stage movements of Director and Assistant work to modify the configurations of character and setting. But even here, such movement eventually achieves the visual isolation of the most inert component of that set-* ting: the standing Protagonist, his position "statuesque" even during his catastrophic final gesture. When it occurs in late Beckett, cross-stage movement presents little disruption of visual</page><page sequence="13">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 361 outline, and although it does introduce a fluidity absent from That Time and A Piece of Monologue, such movement - by its mechanical repetition - serves to confirm one or more images of visual fixity. The lateral pacing of Footfalls, for instance, modifies the stage image while keeping it curiously static, like the weary pacing of a caged animal; this effect is underscored by May's rigid carriage and by the sequences of motionlessness at the right and left extremes of the illuminated strip - sequences which halt movement within two recurrent tableaux. Similarly, the exits and entrances of What Where offer slender variation on a visual pattern, and the characters Bam, Bern, Bim, and Bom, shadowy in the play's half-light, present a purgatorially returning emblem, reduplicating itself with an almost arith- metic recursiveness. As with the premutated movements in the television piece Quad (1982), one senses at moments that this configuration might reconstitute itself endlessly. Movement, then, highlights the solidity of location in the plays under discussion and endows objects and figures with a sculptural quality not unlike that obtained within the theatrical and cinematic landscapes of Jean Cocteau {Les Mariés de la Tour Eiffel La Belle et la Bête). This highlighting gives added weight to the arrangement of characters and objects within Beckett's performance field as well as to the visual relationships established by these locations within three-dimensional space. In terms of forestage and back, one can explore Beckett's use of depth as a component of the theatrical image, and consider visual field as it extends itself perpendicular to the audience's line of sight. In addition to the depth frequently displayed by the visual object itself - the rocking forward and backward, the width of table and pallet bed in Ohio Impromptu and A Piece of Monologue, and the rfcctagular playing area in What Where - Beckett establishes stage depth between visual elements in three of the late plays: Not I, Catastrophe, and What Where. With intriguing consistency, Beckett relies upon a similar configura- tion in each instance, with one visual component (Auditor, Director/ Assistant/ Armchair, Voice) located downstage left (as seen by the audience) and another component (Mouth, Pro- tagonist, Playing Area) located either upstage right or midstage center. Through this kind of binary arrangement, visual field is drawn back into the third dimension, with a noticeable counter- point between forestage and back. Here, too, we must qualify, since stage depth in these plays</page><page sequence="14">362 Comparative Drama is no less complicated than light, color, or movement. In signi- ficant ways, Beckett undermines the depth effects illustrated above and ultimately renders the perceptual depth of his per- formance images disturbingly unstable. For example, diminished light reduces audience perception of depth by muting the articulation of image and the visual contrast essential to distance. Also, the absence of any visual backdrop that might serve as a reference point to gauge the extent (and even the direction) of depth gives the darkness surrounding and separating his visual objects a quality of "depthless space" and gives the objects and figures themselves the eerie effect of floating in an expanse outside measurement. Precision of depth is further undercut in Not I and What Where by the indeterminacy of identity and relationship - an instance of fictional configuration influencing the perception of theatrical configuration. Though Beckett's stage directions specify that Auditor responds to Mouth's ago- nized monologue with "a gesture of helpless compassion" (p. 215), the actions of this enigmatic figure consist solely of its strangely mechanical gesture, directed in unclear response to Mouth's stream of words. In What Where, the illuminated megaphone (V) identifies itself with Bam, but also directs the action across stage and asserts itself in dual relationship to the recessed figures. Whether Auditor and V even inhabit the same fictional space as their onstage companions is unclear in these plays, and the resulting indeterminacy serves to undermine the spatial continuity of theatrical space upon which visual effects such as depth depend. In both instances, downstage and upstage appear to be different dimensions, an effect paralleled (in two dimensions) in the split-screen television superimpositions of Nacht und Träume (1982) and Was Wo (1985). 16 Depth remains indeterminate - both itself and not itself - in part because Beckett's compositional interests lie more with the frontality of visual field, with the performance image processed by the eye in a kind of planar flatness. Supported by the stability of audience position and by the proscenium that frames many productions of the late plays, Beckett gives unusual precedence to what Rudolf Arnheim calls "the two-dimensional projec- tion."l7 Beckett's renewed interest in video as a performance medium attests to this interest, since television fixes the spectator in a position directly more perpendicular to a performance image now flattened on screen - a medium precluding the visual distortions effected by the stage's three-dimensionality and by</page><page sequence="15">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 363 the angles and accidents of theatrical seating. In the theater works, the pull toward two-dimensionality is heightened by the generally frontal posture of figure and object, by frontal illum- ination, and by the arrangement of visual objects, all of which stress lateral configuration over configuration in depth. With its strict horizontality, A Piece of Monologue comes the closest to a pure stage frontality, but Beckett's other plays of the 70's and 80's approximate its almost photographic flatness. The perceptual thickness of Beckett's stage darkness heightens this flatness, "matting" the illuminated image like the black velvet of roadside art. Frontality allows one to stress lateral arrangement in the analysis of Beckett's performance image and the single most prominent feature governing this arrangement: the positioning of character and object "off-center" in relation to the invisible vertical bisecting the stage. To understand the perceptual sig- nificance of this principle, it is worth noting the shift that it represents from the location of visual objects in Beckett's earlier plays. There - with the exception of Waiting for Godot, a play whose spatial arrangement is (for the most part) left indeter- minate^ - centrality rules linear configuration, often ruthlessly. Hamm claims stage center in Endgame, a middle point whose security he confirms by tracing the wall boundaries of his cubic domain. Krapp listens to the recordings of memory at a table "'f]ront center'9 (p. 55), while Winnie is "[i]mbedded up to above her waist in exact center" (p. 7) of a mound that is itself positioned midstage. Beckett's stage direction is revealing of his intended visual effect: "Expanse of scorched grass rising center to low mound. Gentle slopes down to front and either side of stage. Back an abrupter fall to stage level. Maximum of simplicity and symmetry" (p. 7). Reinforced by the pyramidal security of the mound itself, the symmetry of this setting gives the performance image pronounced balance and weight, lodging it stably around the central axis. Beckett repeats these effects in the centric trios of Play and Come and Go as well as in the flat landscape of Breath, symmetric in its absence of verticality. But even in the stage arrangement of these early plays, with their strong centerpoints, there are indications of a competing visual principle, for in Endgame the ashcans of Nagg and Nell are located front left, at an oblique angle to Hamm's central armchair, while in Happy Days Willie's resting place is located at right rear. Each constitutes a secondary playing area at visual</page><page sequence="16">364 Comparative Drama odds with the primary position: tangency is underscored within the rectangular grid of Endgame's setting and the radial focus of Happy Days. It is this position, given primary focus, that will rule the visual configurations of the plays beginning with Not I. Mouth is located "upstage audience right'' Auditor "downstage audience left" (p. 216); the Listener in That Time "midstage off center" (p. 228); May's strip "a little off center audience right" (p. 239) ; the Speaker of A Piece of Monologue "well off center downstage audience left" the lamp "[t]wo meters to his left" pallet foot "extreme right" (p. 265); the Woman in the rocking chair "downstage slightly off center audience left" (p. 275); Listener and Reader "audience right" (p. 285), near and at the end of a table set at midstage; the playing area (P) of What Where "staged right as seen from house" the megaphone (V) "[d]ownstage left" (p. 310). The apparent exception is, once again, Catastrophe, with its Pro- tagonist positioned at "midstage" but the centrality of his position must contend with the competing visual weight (and greater visual mass) of the Director's armchair "downstage audience left" (p. 297). 19 This movement "off-center" represents a pressing visual symbol of the decenteredness of Beckett's dramatic world and the figures who inhabit it: marginalized within time and space, disjointed from the gestures they make and the stories they tell, consigned to an unending linguistic evasion, as they elude the centering subjectivity of "I." Avoiding at all costs the annihilating perception of self, the figures of these plays are living tangents, and their "off-center" positioning presents this condition with the force of emblem. But symbolic meaning is always subordinate in the theater to direct perceptual response, and it is in terms of such response that Beckett's principles of visual arrangement achieve their most dynamic effects. The central positioning of Beckett's earlier plays, for instance, and the compositional pull toward symmetry endows his performance fields with paradoxical visual qualities. As theorists of aesthetic perception attest, the center of any composition is a point of potential rest, a location where visual weight achieves balance and where the forces of attraction and repulsion attain har- mony: in Arnheim's words, "a central position conveys stability. At any other location, objects are possessed by vectors that point in one or another direction."20 At the same time, the very stability of visual centers threatens a kind of stasis, drawing</page><page sequence="17">Stanton 5. Garner, Jr. 365 the directional vectors of movement into a self -cancelling inertia. The center may resonate with perceptual harmony, as a point of balance to which the surrounding elements aspire, but it also constitutes an absence, collapsing movement and direction into stillness and fixity. Such inertia is a kind of death, especially in the theater, which lives through the animating lines of movement and action. Like gravity, then, the centrality of Beckett's earlier work represents not only the seductiveness of surrender and rest but also a frighteningly imminent loss of action. As much as its stability may be yearned for ("What a curse, mobility!" [Happy Days, p. 46]), the center is visually static, a point (to quote Estragon) where "[n]othing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!" {Waiting for Godot, p. 27b). With the shift to "eccentricity," Beckett galvanizes the vectors of the performance image into new perceptual configu- rations and forces the elements of visual field into a different dynamic relationship, If the centricity of Endgame, Happy Days, Play, and Come and Go renders the performance image heavy and inert, the shift away from center in Beckett's later plays introduces the tension of imbalance, endowing stage objects with perceptual disequilibrium in a field now charged with visual pull. As with all visual fields, the latent forces that characterize the stage are directed toward points of balance and visual rest. Given the perceptual magnetism of stage center and the secondary attraction of the stage edges that border this center, objects located "off-center" are characterized by two perceptual strivings: (1) toward the centric position they approach, and (2) toward the stage edges that represent maximum distance from the center and thereby maximum independence from the center's attraction. Off-center objects are characterized, in other words, by the forces of approach and withdrawal, surrender and escape, and they establish fields of strong visual instability. Listener's unbalanced position in That Time, for instance, endows the illuminated head with powerful lateral tension: the image wants to occupy the center, feels disturbingly out of place, and may even appear to move across the field of vision as the spectator's eyes seek to resolve the perceptual instability; at the same time, by asserting a rival center, the Listener seems to pull away as if it wanted to detach itself from the center's magnetic pull. As with the "slightly off center" Woman in Rockaby, figure and field fail to "fit," and</page><page sequence="18">366 Comparative Drama the visual field as a whole, anxious for perceptual harmony, seems to strive to reconcile them. The immobility of Beckett's visual objects heightens the tension of perceptual disequilibrium, and the instability effected by location (in turn) renders the immobility of these objects all the more charged. In several cases, Beckett introduces potential balance into the visual field of his late plays, as a visual "foil" to the pres- sures of the "off-center." In Not I and What Where, he flanks the center of the visual field with two opposing elements, there- by complicating the lines of visual pull and offering the teasing possibility of symmetrical arrangement to offset the imbalance of eccentricity. To some extent, this is what he achieves: Mouth and Auditor, like V and the occupants of P, confront each other as visual counterparts. But differences in visual weight, alter- nating and competing claims to attention, and the indeterminate relationship between the components of each pair preserve the effects of imbalance, and the promise of symmetry becomes yet another occasion for instability. In A Piece of Monologue, Beckett arranges his three elements in linear formation with the upright lamp serving, fulcrum-like, as its own center for the upright Speaker and èie more distant pallet-foot. But the space between this provisional center and the actual stage center pulls the lamp toward the latter; in the absence of movement in this direction, the Speaker-lamp pair appears disproportionately heavy, while the stage begins to feel as though it might tilt to the left. In each case, multiple elements allow Beckett to complicate his visual study of weight and location, to dramatize the failures of symmetry and the triumphs of imbalance, and to explore the tensions generated by competing points of insta- bility. That Beckett has often felt uneasy about this visual competition does not invalidate its striking theatrical effects.21 Beckett plays additional variations upon "eccentricity" and its perceptual tensions. The choreographed pacing of Footfalls, occurring within the bounds of an illuminated strip "a little off center audience right," presents a visual image that shifts be- tween poles of imbalance, vaguely rocking with oscillating weight. Stage center becomes only one step among many, a space to be crossed, but its perceptual draw exerts destabilizing pressure upon May's movement and her stationary positions. Like a planet in eccentric orbit, May acquires a tense heaviness at the end of the strip closest to midstage (L), and she is drawn centripetally toward a center that she nonetheless resists; at the</page><page sequence="19">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 361 further end (R), she acquires a more pronounced centrifugality, pulling towards the darkness into which her illuminated strip seems to thrust. The differences are slight, but they are never- theless felt within a performance field that addresses the eye so insistently, and they establish a perceptual modulation to count- erpoint both the stillness of May standing and the measured constancy of the pacing itself. Ohio Impromptu offers one of Beckett's most complex visual explorations of centricity and weight. Like Not /, the play's perceptual field is inhabited by two figures, each conceived in relationship to the other. Unlike Mouth and Auditor in the earlier play, however, these figures form part of a unitary per- formance image centered on the white deal table. Located at midstage, the table's center corresponds to the center of the visual field as a whole; indeed, Beckett underscores this over- lapping centricity by marking the shared pivot with the wide- brimmed black hat. Considered by itself, the table offers a per- fectly symmetrical image, one which is bisected by the invisible plane of midstage. But Beckett complicates this visual symmetry by his positioning of Listener and Reader, grouped close to each other at audience right, the former facing ahead while the latter faces left. Because of this eccentric clustering, the balance of the entire image is weighted heavily to the right, and, with the invisibility of the table's legs, only the hat's visual heaviness seems to keep the left end of the table top from flipping up. Moreover, the perpendicular seating of the identical figures establishes a competing symmetry axis for the image as a whole - an axis which cuts across the right half of the table at a 45-degree angle as though mirrors linked the seated figures in oblique reflection. As with the other performance fields of Beckett's late plays, the visual elements of Ohio Impromptu strive to attain an elusive balance, while the obliqueness and eccentricity of their arrangement leaves them animated with perceptual tension. One can imagine the very different con- figuration of visual forces had Beckett positioned Listener across from Reader at the table's left end. m Verbal "Index" In all of the visual categories we have considered and throughout the sequence of eight remarkably different plays, Beckett's late work for the theater reveals con- sistent principles of visual organization - principles which sub-</page><page sequence="20">368 Comparative Drama sume particular features and individual instances. As perfor- mance images, these plays are governed by the laws of "almost" and "not quite"; subject to pulls and deflections, separation and penetration, they inhabit the unstable region of the "slightly off." Visual field in Beckett's plays contrasts markedly with tradi- tional performance space, and its elements reportedly disrupt conventional perceptual categories: figures poised between character and object, switching back and forth like the twin images of an optical illusion; illumination caught between light and darkness; color warped into the black-and-white continuum; movement and depth subordinated to the two-dimensional fixity of the frontal plane; the elements of that plane charged with the tensions of imbalance and off-center. Unstable in articulation and arrangement, these theatrical images "claw"22 precisely because they elude the more traditional categories of visual composition. They are images ajar, asserting a precarious inde- pendence from more balanced display. This departure in late Beckett toward the tension of the slightly off is paralleled in the relationship between visual image and verbal text. In a medium at once visual and linguistic, visual field is never free in performance from the directions and descriptions of language. Indeed, language is a crucial adjunct to the mise-en-scène, for it directs attention to the components of visual field as it establishes linguistic bridges between the worlds of fiction and stage.23 When Shakespeare's Caesar ob- serves "Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look" {Julius Caesar I.ii.194), his words serve as a verbal "index" for the scene's visual configuration since they underscore both a feature of expression and the physical distance governing the spatial con- figuration of the two men. The names, pronouns, deictic adverbs, and direct descriptions endemic to dramatic language contribute important reinforcement to the components and arrangement of the performance image and serve as pointers or "captions" within the mise-en-scène. Verbal index, in this role, is an important component of Beckett's earlier plays, for it serves to underscore the fixity of character within the theatrical moment and (often) the harsh materiality of the stage and its props. Winnie's language, for instance, is rich with indexical specifica- tion: The sunshade will be there again tomorrow, beside me on this mound, to help me through the day. (Pause. She takes up mirror.) I take up this little glass, I shiver it on a stone - (does so) - I</page><page sequence="21">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 369 throw it away - {does so far behind her) - it will be in the bag again tomorrow, without a scratch, to help me through the day. {Happy Days, p. 39). In their reference to the surrounding mound, her words here fix her more firmly within the constraining visual environment, and in their narration of action they provide her gestures with almost pictorial outline. Her discourse grounds itself in the physicality of the stage setting, and in so doing it heightens the visual components of that setting through a kind of linguistic doubling. As they abandon the "I" that serves as linchpin between Winnie's discourse and the actress' theatrical presence, Beckett's late plays relinquish the necessary connection between language and the performance field. As a consequence, the linguistic components of these plays - monologue, narration, description - are displaced from the stage itself, pointing to more fully self-contained worlds through the indirection of third person. The result is a skewing of index as language gestures only marginally at the actual scene of performance. Do the characters in these plays describe their theatrical condition or the worlds of fiction as they speak of darkened rooms and of characters whom they somewhat resemble? In each of these plays, the answer is both, as the images of discourse approximate but often fail to match the images of performance: . . . what? ... the buzzing? ... yes ... all the time the buzzing . . . dull roar like falls . . . and the beam . . . flickering on and off ... starting to move around . . . like moonbeam but not . . . all part of the same . . . keep an eye on that too ... corner of the eye. . . . {Not I, p. 221) Watch it pass - [Pause.] - watch her pass before the candelabrum, how its flames, their light . . . like moon through passing rack. {Footfalls, p. 242) Turns in the end and gropes to where he knows the lamp is stand- ing. Thinks he knows. Was last standing. When last went out. Match one as described for globe. Two for chimney. Three for wick. Chimney and globe back on. Turns wick low. Backs away to edge of light and turns to face wall. East. Still as the lamp by his side. {A Piece of Monologue, p. 267) I am alone. It is summer. {What Where, p. 314) Speaking of passages like the above from A Piece of Monologue, S. E. Gontarski observes: "This dislocation between narrative and stage image creates a permanently unresolved and shifting set of relationships."24 From our perspective, the discrepancies</page><page sequence="22">370 Comparative Drama between narrative and visual fields contribute additional insta- bility to the performance image and heighten its perceptual tensions of "almost" and "not quite." Like imperfect super- impositions, language and the theatrical image strive toward the twin resting points of identity and dissociation, but, like the unbalanced elements of Beckett's stage configurations, they remain trapped within their mutual instability, caught between the contending realms of fiction and performance. To borrow one of Rockaby's recurrent phrases, Beckett's disjunctions of text and stage fix the visual field even more forcefully within the perceptual instabilities of "a little like" (p. 275). IV We might be tempted to call the visual techniques of Beckett's late plays an "art of indeterminacy" were it not for the precision with which Beckett specifies the conditions of instability and the equal precision with which these conditions produce their often visceral effects. For the half-lights, the color mutations, the off-centers, the failed symmetries, and even the displace- ments of verbal index are the function of clearly defined aber- rations, and their effects on audience perception result from their relationship to specific reference points of illumination, color, position, and textual reference. In so doing, the visual techniques of Beckett's late plays violate through systematic strategies the perceptual inclinations and tendencies of the spec- tator as visual processor of theatrical imagery. It is here that we encounter an essential paradox of Beckett's late plays. As Beckett's characters find themselves increasingly confined in their ability to act, limited in their ability even to perceive the diminished worlds into which they are thrown, Beckett's audi- ence finds itself involved more deeply in the activities of seeing, engaged more fully in the perception of the theatrical image. At the same time, the plays from Not I through What Where require seeing of a different order from that of the earlier plays and from that of conventional theatrical spectacle. The percep- tual dynamics forged in late Beckett involve latency and discord, an impulse toward movement and change, the tense striving of the image to resolve itself and its unstable perceptual forces. If it is true that "Beckett sees the task of modern art to be the attempt at visual representation of movement,"25 then his late plays accomplish this task with striking theatrical innovation through their combining of pictorial fixity with acute visual</page><page sequence="23">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 371 dynamism. The diminishment of actual movement in Beckett's dramatic career, in other words, has been accompanied by a liberation of immanent movement in a performance field at once barely mobile and profoundly restless. It is Beckett's genius in his later plays to explore the activity lodged within stillness and to sound the depths of visual latency. The result - for this playwright of the image - is to etch the contours of performance even more within the spectator and to replace a theater of activity with a theater of perception, guided by the eye and its efforts to see. Animated by a dramaturgy of middle regions, and by an intensity of perceptual activity, the "seeing-place" of Beckett's late plays has become a performance field of unpre- cedented visual complexity.

By doing so, Beckett effectively "de-anthropomorphizes" the performance space and liberates the illuminated figures from the contexts of normal human height as well as from the implicit presence of a body that such height suggests. This effect is similar to that obtained in Play, where human heads protrude from urns "about one yard high1* (p. 147). 8 The pressure toward formal abstraction in Beckett's dramatization of the human figure can be appreciated by considering his revisions of the original What</page><page sequence="24">372 Comparative Drama Where. In the version filmed for German television (Was Wo, 1985), Beckett reduced Bam, Bern, Bim, and Bom to faces alternating in a trio of nearly circular ovals, with Voice changed from a megaphone to a larger, dimly-perceptible face. In a revised theater version first performed in Paris (1986), Bam, Bern, Bim, and Bom remain faces, now suspended in stage darkness, and Voice has become a pool of orange light For accounts of the former production, see Martha D. Fehsenfeld, '"Every- thing Out but the Faces': Beckett's Reshaping of What Where for Television," Modern Drama, 29 (1986), 229-40; for an account of the latter, see Brater, Beyond Mini- malism, pp. 163-64. Unless otherwise noted, the present study will restrict its obser- vations to the play's original (1983) version. 9 Brater offers a perceptive analysis of the play of light on the theatrical object in Rockaby: "Beckett in fact makes us see the same figure in different artificial lights, offering us an ever-shifting series of perspectives from which to encounter the image anew. . . . Throughout the play . . . gradations of light are ... meant to shift and vary, sometimes even to sparkle and gleam as the rocking chair is made to sway 'to and fro' "(Beyond Minimalism, p. 168). io "This mime should be played on a low and narrow platform at back of stage, violently lit in its entire length, the rest of the stage being in darkness" (Act Without Words II, p. 49); "Table and immediately adjacent area in strong white light. Rest of stage in darkness" (Krapp* s Last Tape, p. 55). Beckett's lighting directions for Play specify "[s]trong spots" (p. 148) for the play's first half and its final Chorus and fainter spots for the play's first and middle Choruses and its second half. For a discussion of the thematic roles of light and darkness in Beckett's earlier prose and drama, see James Knowlson, Light and Darkness in the Theatre of Samuel Beckett (London: Turret Books, 1972). 11 Beckett, The Collected Shorter Plays, p. 248. 12 For the 1976 Berlin production, Beckett experimented with an addition to the drama of light in Footfalls, a technical device that was also included in the 1984 New York production directed by Alan Schneider. Walter D. Asmus has described the innovation in his production notes: "a vertical strip of light should be visible in the background, which could give the impression that the light was falling through the crack of a door. Then it would add a vertical accent to the horizontal light on the strip which would remain lit after each part At the very end of the play, the empty strip will be faded out first, then, after ten seconds, the vertical strip of light" ("Practical Aspects of Theatre, Radio, and Television: Rehearsal Notes for the German Premiere of Beckett's 'That Time' and 'Footfalls' at the Schiller-Theater Werkstatt, Berlin," trans. Helen Watanabe, Journal of Beckett Studies, No. 2 (Sum- mer 1977), p. 88. Visually, the implications of this device for the play's lighting score are significant In addition to providing vertical accent for the horizontal strip and (of perhaps greater significance) a measure of verticality for May's stooped posture, the unvarying vertical strip provides a standard of brightness for the subtle modu- lations of half-light Though somewhat intrusive in relation to the dimmer light's action, its vividness did serve to counterbalance the weight of the surrounding black- ness, establishing a visual polarity within which the half-light oscillates. One suspects that, in addition to stated reasons, Beckett felt a need to give the central light more perceptual status and to render it less hostage to the surrounding darkness. 13 See Cohn, Just Play, p. 235. At one point during rehearsals for the Berlin Footfalls, Beckett felt that the production displayed "[t]oo much color" (Asmus, "Practical Aspects of Theatre, Radio, and Television," p. 86). 14 Alison Jane Hale, The Broken Window: Beckett s Dramatic Perspective (West Lafayette: Purdue Univ. Press, 1987), p. 99. 15 See Martin Esslin, "A Poetry of Moving Images." 16 This indeterminacy of depth is largely eliminated from Catastrophe, a play whose action is set within a naturalistic set meant to represent a rehearsal stage. Even here, though, the final light reduction eliminates these familiar boundaries and plunges the Protagonist's illuminated head into the more familiar spatial limbo of the other late plays.</page><page sequence="25">Stanton B. Garner, Jr. 373 17 Arnheim, Art and Visual Perception, p. 288. 18 Even in the relative absence of stage specifications, however, one can detect compositional pressures toward stage center in Godot. Gogo's boots are deposited at front center at the close of each act, and they dominate the stage in this position before Didi's entrance at the start of Act II. Similarly, the cross-stage movement between "extreme left" and "extreme right" implicitly underscores the center as a spatial reference point 19 It is interesting, in light of this abandonment of centricity, that when Beckett directed the Berlin production of Happy Days in 1971 he shifted Winnie slightly to the right of center.
