<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL: A MEDIEVAL MOSAIC FLOOR IN TURIN ERNST KITZINGER A. Kingsley Porter University Professor, Harvard University (Read April 25, 1969) Dedicated to Millard Meiss WHEN THE White House was being renovated in the early 1950's, Mr. Truman gave orders that the Presidential Seal be raised from the floor of the Reception Room and displayed in a place of honor above the door. The President ex- plained at the time that it annoyed him to see the Seal desecrated by having people walk on it.' Mr. Truman was voicing an age-old sentiment. In many periods in the past there has been sensitivity particularly in regard to religious symbols or representations on floors. As early as 427 A.D., the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II issued a decree prohibiting the representation of the "sign of Christ" (i.e., the cross) on pave- ments.2 In the twelfth century, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, writing about the church floors of his time, protested in language more forceful and picturesque than 1\Jr. Truman's against images of saints being ground underfoot and the faces of angels being spat on.3 Obviously, in the decoration of churches the difficulty presents itself in an especially acute form. This paper will be about one particular church floor, of a period not far distant from St. Bernard's, in which the problem was solved in a rather inter- esting and illuminating fashion. It was, of course, easy to avoid the whole difficulty by leaving the floor unadorned or by decorating it with abstract and ornamental de- signs only. This was normal practice during many periods of Christian art. At other times, however, there was a strong urge to make the 1 New York Times, March 4, 1952. Cf. E. B.

To do this without inviting desecration-this was the rub. The problem presented itself to the designers of churches from the outset. Indeed, it was the formative period of ecclesiastical architecture, beginning with the official recognition of the Christian religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, which brought with it the first flowering of Christian pictorial floor decoration.4 Pavement mosaic had been a ubiquitous and highly diversified medium in the Graeco-Roman world; and the craft carried over into the build- ings of the triumphant church by the sheer momentum of its tradition. In the ensuing three or four centuries a range of suitable subject matter was established largely by a process of selection from and adaptation of the existing repertory of motifs and only to a much lesser degree by the introduction of new and specifically Christian themes. Very occasionally even a subject from classical mythology-Orpheus, for instance, playing his lyre to an assemblage of animals 5-was taken over, with a motivation that is not always entirely clear to the modern observer. By far the richest store of usable images, however, was that pertaining to the world of nature and country life. Plants, animals, birds, and fishes, as well as hunting, fishing and other rural genre scenes were subjects of an essentially neutral kind and were readily ab- sorbed into ecclesiastical settings. Such motifs 4Outstanding among the floor mosaics of this period are those in the twin churches built by Bishop Theodore at Aquileia (P. L. Zovatto, Mosaici Paleocristiani delle Venezie [Udine, n.d.], p. 63 ff.). 5 Cf. a well-known pavement in the Archaeological Museum, Istanbul, found in the excavation of a Christian chapel in Jerusalem (A.

Often they served to conjure up a vision of an idyllic garden landscape or paradise, and some- times the reference was made quite specific by including, in the form of traditional personi- fications of river gods, the four rivers that flowed from the Garden of Eden.6 Motifs from the same repertory could be selected and arranged to point up a specific Biblical theme such as Isaiah's vision of the Peaceable Kingdom ("the lion shall eat straw like the ox")7 or the same prophet's Parable of the Vineyard.8 They could be keyed to a liturgical action such as baptism,9 the offertory rite '? or even the eucharistic sacrifice."' Or else-and this is a category for which some examples will be noted in more detail later in this study-they could, in conjunction with other representations of the physical world such as sun and moon, cities and countries or personified months, seasons, and winds, present the faithful with a kind of encyclopedic view of creation."2 All this could be done without incurring the risk 6 See, for instance, the floor of a sixth-century church in Qasr el-Lebya (A.

See below, p. 369 ff. of desecration. For more explicitly Biblical subject matter there was the world of the Old Testament. Stories such as those of Jonah and Daniel, popular in all branches of Early Christian art, could be put on the floor with impunity.'3 The limit was reached with representations such as the Good Shepherd 14-a direct reference to Christ which soon was banished from the floor- and the cross, which was the subject of Theo- dosius's edict.'5 Despite that imperial pro- hibition, however, crosses were occasionally de- picted on floors even after it was issued.'6 The first great flowering of Christian pictorial floor decoration came to an end in the chaotic conditions that engulfed the Mediterranean world in the seventh century. But a second suclh wave occurred in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, along with the rise of Romanesque architecture in Europe. It was this vogue, centered in France, the Rhineland, and Italy, that occasioned St. Bernard's perhaps somewhat exaggerated outburst. Again the world of nature-tlhe animal kingdom in particular- furnished most of the models; again one finds a variety of genre scenes as well as encyclopedic and cosmographic subjects; and once more it was the Old Testament that provided most of the specifically religious themes.'7 What con- nection there may be between this second vogue of Christian floor decoration and the early one is still obscure. Only a trickle of examples from the intervening centuries links the two.'8 There are cases of mosaicists of the Romanesque period copying ornamental patterns of much "3For Jonah see, e.g., a famous mosaic at Aquileia (Zovatto, op. cit., p. 86 f. and figs. 92, 94); for Daniel a mosaic at Sfax (Bulletin archeologique, 1917: p.

But it is doubtful that Romanesque artists could have seen a great deal of the earlier iconographic repertory. In their days much of it lay buried under layers of earth and debris, to become accessible again only in modern times through archaeological excavation. Much of it also was outside their geographical reach. More- over, the similarities between the Early Christian and the Romanesque subject matter are on the 19 H.

The floors of the eleventh and twelfth centuries are replete with characteristically medieval motifs such as fantastic animals, fables, and personifications of Virtues and Vices. One even finds figures from Arthurian legend and the Song of Roland.20 It may well be, then, that what these floors have in common with those of the earlier period is largely a matter of a similar response to the basic restrictions inherent in this particular form of church decoration. The floor to be discussed lhere is a mature and rather late example of Romanesque art.

It does, however, invite interesting comparisons with mosaics of the first period and it exemplifies particularly well both the unity and the distinctiveness of the two great phases of Christian pavement decoration. Its designer solved the problem of imagery on the church floor in a manner that was at once traditional and strikingly and specifically medieval. I In 1909 excavations on the north side of the Cathedral of Turin brought to light the remains of one of the churches that occupied the area before the Cathedral was built in the late fifteenth century (fig. 1). The church, a three- aisled basilica, was identified as S. Salvatore, a fouindation going back to the Early Christian ~ / J ----.- . I,~~~~~~~~~t Zi FIG. 2. Turin, S. Salvatore.

Originally a square whose sides measured more than 7 meters, the pave- ment was found in fragmentary condition. Its south side had been truncated when the Ca- thedral was built. Other lacunae were due to graves subsequently installed in the area. What 21 P. Toesca, "Vicende di un' antica chiesa di Torino," Bollettino d'arte 4 (1910): p. 1 ff. Cf. A.

In installing the pavement in the museum, certain changes were made in the arrangement of the fragments; and some details, especially in the inscriptions, have been lost or are no longer discernible.24 Adjust- 22 The photograph reproduced in our fig. 3 was taken when the mosaic was still in situ and shows the main extant portioni.

For ments subsequently made in l oesca's readings of the inscriptions by P. Gribaudi 2I and F. Patetta 26 will be taken into account wlhen this seems justified. A person mounting the steps to the chancel was greeted first by a mosaic inscription in four lines in an oblong panel attached to the west side of the main square (fig. 6). The lines of lettering, which were rendered alternately in black on white ground and in white on black ground, were preserved to only about two-thirds of their length and have not yielded a coherent reading.

The mosaic carpet itself is likewise in black and white, though Toesca noted also some red tesserae made of terracotta.9 Its basic design consisted of a circle inscribed in a square field, with a smaller circle at its center, eight still smaller circles (interlaced witlh each other and with both the outer and inner circles) in the space between the two, and circles also in the four spandrels that remain between the outer circle and the square frame. As a purely geometric configuration the design has parallels among opus sectile floors, particularly among the rich pavements executed in that technique in medi- eval Byzantium and their Italian derivatives.30 But, as we shall see, in the present instance the our mosaic and at S.

The square frame, which bears a pattern of small interlacing circles filled with various motifs, appears to be purely ornamental. Many of its filler motifs are indistinct, though a few figures of animals and birds and some ornaments, such as rosettes and an angular knot, can be made out (figs. 3, 6-8). It is the large circle inscribed in this square which provides the key to the meaning of the entire composition. That circle is rendered as a broad black band, framed by a narrow black band on the inside and a sawtooth border on the outside, and filled witlh two wavy white lines which seem to denote water (figs. 3-8). This is indeed how the broad band must be interpreted. For in the lower left-hand section, which is the best preserved part of the band, the "waves" are interrupted by two panels which are literally islands, as witness their inscriptions (figs. 3, 4, 7, 9). One, which is semicircular in shape, bears the words: BRITANIA INSVLA INTER FVSA MARI ORCADES INSVLE TILE VLTIMA INSVLA while the oblong panel immediately to the right is inscribed: SCOCIA INSV LA P(ro)XIMA BRI TANIE VBI NVLLA ANGV(is). We are, then, in the presence of a map showing the islands of the far North and West. The legends with which they are inscribed are taken almost verbatim from the Etymologiae of Isidorus of Seville.3" In terms of medieval geographic concepts, the water in which the islands are placed must represent the ocean wlhile the area enclosed by the circle is the orbis terrarum girdled by the ocean.32 Presumably when the mosaic was complete other islands could be seen in other parts of the water band. The spandrels in the four corners outside the " ocean"p were given over to representations of 31 Isidorus, Etymologiae, XIV, vi, 2-6 (ed. W. M. Lindsay EOxford, 1911]): "Brittania Oceani insula interfuso Esic] mari . . .Thyle ultima insula . . . Orcades insulae . . . Scotia. . .proxima Brittaniae insula . . . Illic nulla anguis. . . ." 32 See infra, p. 356 f. FIG. 7. Mosaic. Two W\inds and Island. winds. A common feature of medieval mappae mundi, these are a further indication that the design as a whole is to be understood as a depic- tion of the world. The scheme of the winds again was derived from Isidorus, who both in his Etymologiae and in his De natura rerum enumer- ates and describes (on the basis of earlier authori- ties) twelve winds, four principal and eight secondary ones. Texts from Isidorus's two trea- tises accompanied the representations on the mosaic. There must have been three winds in each spandrel, but again only the lower left-hand sector is fully preserved (figs. 3, 4, 7). In it are represented-correctly in terms of the adjacent islands-"Septemtrio," the North Wind, and its two satellite winds, "Aquilo" and "Circius." The principal wind is shown as a full-length figure in a circular frame; the other two appear as heads or busts in much smaller medallions on either side. "Septemtrio" is a winged, semi- nude figure running swiftly to the left. A rich drapery envelopes his legs. He holds to his mouth a curious twin horn from which air can be seen issuing and one half of which has mounted</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 117, NO. 5, 1973] WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL 351 on it another (smaller) horn curved backwards. The inscription on his frame reads: SEPTEMTRIO33 FRI[gidu]S ET NIVALI(s) AB34 CIRCVLO SEPTEM 35 STELLAR(um) SVRGIT.36 "Aquilo," placed to the right (or "east") of "Septemtrio," is a profile bust blowing a large horn which projects outside his medallion and which he supports with his hand, also seen outside the frame. His inscription, which is fragmentary and now in part very indistinct, may be read as follows: [aq]V(i)LO 37 VENT(us) Q(ui) ET BOREAS. DA(t)38 NVBES ET AQVAS39 *EFtrin]GtIT.40 "That this is the first word of the inscription is indi- cated by the white dividing line to its left. Apparently all the inscriptions in this spandrel begin above the heads of the figures. 34 In this tentative reading of what appears to be an unusual ligature I am following Patetta (op. cit., p. 329). Toesca, who does not comment on this feature, evidently took it for a sign separating the end of the inscription from the beginning and started his reading with the word following on the right. 35 These two words are now largely destroyed but were fully preserved when the mosaic was photographed in situ; cf. fig. 3. 36 For the first part of this legend cf. Isidorus, De natura rerum, XXXVII, 1 (ed. J. Fontaine [Bordeaux, 1960], p. 295): "Septentrio frigidus et nivalis"; for the second part cf. idem, Etymologiae, XIII, xi, 11: "Septentrio dictus eo quod circulo septem stellarum consurgit." 37 In taking this to be the first word I am following Patetta (op. cit., p. 330) rather than Toesca. For the third letter, now no longer visible, see Toesca, op. cit., p. 6. 38 I am following Toesca's reading. Patetta read D (icitu)R, which is unlikely; the period preceding the word seems to mark the beginning of a new phrase. 39 I am adopting Patetta's reading of the ligature which follows the word NVBES as ET A, rather than reading NVBES AEQVAS as does Toesca. As Patetta points out (op. cit., p. 330), one only has a choice here between an unusual ligature and a corrupt text. The passages in Isidorus on which the inscription is based leave no doubt that the sentence was meant to refer to nubes et aquas. 40 This reading was first suggested by Gribaudi (op. cit. [supra, n. 25], p. 626) and adopted by Patetta. It involves taking the letters placed inside the medallion as an "overflow" of the inscription on the frame and interpre- ting the final sign as a period within a circle rather than as a letter. Toesca read GITO and apparently took this to be another name for Aquilo-Boreas. Such a name, however, is not otherwise accounted for; and Toesca's reading in its entirety does not give the meaning that this inscription should convey. Stringit has the authority of Isidorus behind it. and provides the meaning he intended. Cf. De natura rerum, XXXVII, 1 (Fontaine, p. 295): "Aquilo ventus qui et Boreas vocatur . . . qui non dis- cutit nubes, sed stringit." The second part of the in- "Circius" is "Aquilo's" pendant and blows his horn, which again projects far outside his circular frame, in the opposite direction. His hand holding the horn is inside the frame. The background of his medallion, as distinct from that of the other two, is black. Conversely, its framing band is white with lettering in black, whereas the other two medallions had black frames with the inscriptions in white. The inscription on the frame of "Circius," which is shorter than the others and easily legible, reads CIRCIVS FACIT NIVES ET GRANDINGES [sic]. While this text derives from Isidorus's De natura rerum,4l a second inscription, based on Etymologiae,42 was placed outside the medallion above and below the projecting part of the horn: CIR 43 [cius d]ICT(us) EO Q(uo)D CORO IVNCT VS EST.44 The only other spandrel of which a major portion has survived is the lower right-hand one (figs. 5, 8).45 Again the principal wind is a full-length figure in a circular frame, and we may assume that it was flanked by two heads of satellite winds, though only one has survived.46 The main wind, which has lost its head and part of its body, was a spritelike, nude, black figure, winged, with its legs sharply bent and spread scription, however, is closer to Etymologiae, XIII, xi, 12: "Aquilo dictus eo quod aquas stringat et nubes dissipet." 41 XXXVII, 1 (Fontaine, p. 295): "Circius . . . facit nives et grandinum coagulationes." 42 XIII, xi, 12: "Circius dictus eo quod Coro sit iunctus." 43 The letters are no longer extant but are clearly visible on the photograph taken in situ (fig. 3). 44 Nothing now remains of the last line, but all five of its letters can be made out in the photograph fig. 3. It is not clear why Toesca transcribes the last two words of the inscription as though they were abbreviated. 41 The pavement as now installed in the museum shows the lower right-hand fragment turned 180 degrees and placed on top-i.e., in terms of the original orientation, to the east-of the main extant portion. As a result, the lower right-hand spandrel now appears as the upper right- hand one. There is no photograph of the lower right-hand fragment in situ. To visualize it in its original position it is necessary to refer to Zocchi's drawing (fig. 2). 46 Toesca (op. cit., p. 6) speaks of a head on either side of the central figure, but Zocchi's drawing (fig. 2) makes it appear doubtful that anything could have survived of the head to the left of that figure. There is no trace of it in the mosaic as now installed in the museum. Patetta (op. cit., p. 331) speaks of "pochi tratti" of a second lateral head.</page><page sequence="9">352 ERNST KITZINGER 1PROC.

T his head is not framed and has no inscription unequivocally belonging to it. FIG. 9. Mosaic. Griffins. According to Isidorus, the three winds in this sector should be Zephyrus, the West Wind (also called Favonius), with Africus on his right and Corus on his left.47 It would seem that all tlhree names were accommodated on the circular frame of the main wind, of which, however, only about one-half is preserved. T he first letter of A[fricus] and the last letter of [Zephyru]S (or [Favoniu]S) can still be seen. Lines separated these names (which were meant to be read from inside the circle, as are all the inscriptions in the preceding spandrel) from the words CHOR(us) .NVBES in the part of the frame that has remained intact. Since these latter words adjoin the negroid head and are to be read from the outside, they presumably are in- tended as a caption for that head, which by virtue of its location should indeed represent Corus. The head is identified also by the in- scription accompanying "Circius," the next wind following in a clockwise direction, which, it will be remembered, quotes Isidorus to the effect that Circius adjoins Corus. The word NVBES seems to be a reference in telegram style to Isiodorus's statement in De natura rerum that "eo (scil. Coro) flante, in oriente nubila sunt . . . , 48 while the word CLAVD- [at] placed inside the medallion just above NVBES must be taken as an equally condensed version of his assertion that "Corus . . . ven- torum circulum claudat." 4 Nothing has survived of the top left spandrel, which must have depicted the East Wind (Sub- solanus or Apeliotes) witlh its satellites Vul- turnus (or Caecias) and Eurus.50 Of the top right spandrel, Zocchi's drawing reproduced by Toesca shows a few indistinct remnants, with which one may identify three small pieces now placed on either side of the fragment from the lower right spandrel (figs. 2, 5). One of these pieces shows part of a black circular frame, pre- sumably belonging to a satellite wind and in- scribed with the letters OVS ;51 the shapes on the other two are too fragmentary to be identified. The winds in this space must have been Auster 47 Etymologiae, XIII, xi, 2f.; De natura rerum, XXXVII, 4 (Fontaine, p. 297). 48 Ibid. 49Etymologiae, XIII, xi, 10. C:f.

The area encircled by the ocean bears, instead of the continents, a geometric composition already described above as a system of eight circles around an inner circle. That inner circle, however, again carries an exact and clearly specified meaning, for it represents the well-known allegory of Fortuna's Wheel (figs. 3, 4, 11). Fortuna herself, a crowned figure wearing over a short tunic a richly draped mantle held together by a clasp on her left shoulder, stands at the hub of the circle and is ready to turn it. Her name was inscribed on either side of her head, though only the letters FOR/TV[na] have survived. Her left hand is destroyed, but it is clear that with both her hands she held on to two inward curving lines which form roughly elliptical compartments above and to the left of her and at the same time give her a grip on her wheel. When the mosaic was complete there were four such compartments surrounding her, each containing a figure which symbolized a state of human fortune. The figure on top, cut off at the waist, has long hair and is presumably meant to be female. She wears a crown similar to Fortuna's but with a small cross in front. Dressed in a long-sleeved tunic and a mantle which covers both shoulders, she holds in her right hand what looks like a flower, though the object may be intended to represent the fleur-de-lys finial of a scepter. The right side of her compartment is lost and with it both lher left hand and the second half of the inscription that was placed on either side of her crown. The letters EFFE which remain to the left suffice to show that to label the four states of fortune the designer of our mosaic has not made use of the familiar hexameter "Regnabo/ Regno/ Regnavi/ Sum sine regno." 53 Though he depicted the vagaries of fortune in terms of the rise and fall of royalty, he spelled out the idea with a different set of words at which we can only guess. Toesca 54 proposed to complete the word inscribed on top to read EFFE[rtur], a reading I would emend to EFFEEror], since normally these inscriptions are couched in the first person as though the figures themselves 62 Etymologiae, XIII, xi, 3, 6, 7; De natura rerum, XXXVII, 3 (Fontaine, p. 297). 53 See infra, p. 363. 54 Op. cit., p. 6.

Below there remains part of a prostrate figure symbolizing the nadir of misfortune. A crown, lost in the fall, lies on the ground beside it. The figure was semi-nude; and it is not impossible that the symbolism in- volved in this loss of attire was warningly al- luded to in the inscription at the entrance.56 The figure was accompanied by an inscription of which the single letter "M" is visible on the photograph taken when the mosaic was in situ (fig. 3). The letter has since been lost, along with what had remained of the figure's bare left arm and chest. Mlore is preserved of the compart- ment on the left and of the hopefully rising young man it contains. He wears a mantle over a short tunic with an ornament at the lower hem and gesticulates vividly with both hands. Al- though his face is lost, enough is preserved of his neckline to indicate that his head was thrown back in an expectant glance upward toward a crown which hovers temptingly in the central compartment just beside Fortuna's head. The cycle of royal glory, misery, and aspiration is complete. Of the eight circles that surrounded the Wheel of Fortuna, five are more or less fully preserved. Three in the lower left-hand sector contain pairs of animals in heraldic groupings (figs. 3, 4, 9). Two long-legged birds with long, pointed beaks-cranes, according to Toesca-face each other in the bottom roundel. There follows in clockwise direction a pair of spirited lions placed back to back, with their heads (not preserved) turned toward each other, and a pair of griffins sitting on their haunches and facing each other. The other two partially extant circles contain respectively a bull, whose nose is pierced by a ring that serves to hold a rope tying him to the trunk of a tree, and an elephant carrying on his back a howdah with a tower, while a second tower appears behind (figs. 5, 10). These two animals were in the "three o'clock" and "four to five o'clock" position and faced left, thus greeting a person entering the chancel.57 ad astra feror (or vehor) accompany the rising figure on the left, while for the figure on top the verb efferre is used in the past tense (glorior elatus).

On the inside, biting into the band that forms the Wheel of Fortuna, were grotesque masks with horns, three of which are extant in the upper left-hand sector (figs. 3, 4, 11). One of these is white, the other two are black. The horns of another such mask have survived in the lower right-hand sector between the bull and the ele- phant (figs. 5, 10). Of the motifs in the outer spandrels there have been preserved a small nondescript quadruped facing left (between the circles containing the paired birds and the paired lions, figs. 3, 4), a nude figure, also facing left, mounted on an animal and holding a three- thonged whip (between the lion and griffin circles, figs. 3, 4, 9); part of a long-tailed bird (a peacock?) facing right (in the small area of mosaic that remained in the upper right-hand sector; fig. 5);58 and a mermaid (between the bull and elephant circles; figs. 5, 10). II It is not possible to say with certainty when this remarkable mosaic was laid. There is no inscription that provides a date, a name or any other definite clue. Nor is the architectural context of any help, since we do not know when the floor of the chancel of S. Salvatore was raised to the level on which the mosaic was placed. Toesca attributed the mosaic to the twelfth century, with an implied preference for the latter half or even the end of that century.59 The soundness and perspicacity of his reasoning still stand out after an interval of more than sixty years; and there can be no doubt that his conclusion was correct. At the same time, it is sad to reflect that the intervening decades have brought forth so little additional evidence with which to support or refine it. Toesca referred in general terms to other figure pave- ments of the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Italy; to Italian illuminated manuscripts of the same period displaying a similar outline style; and to the popularity of the theme of Fortuna's two o'clock" positions respectively. For the original positions see Zocchi's drawing (fig. 2). 68 In the installation in the museum the fragment with the bird has been placed next to the roundel with the elephant; cf. fig. 5. 6 Op. cit., P. 7 ff.</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 117, NO. 5, 1973] WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL 355 Wheel during the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies. More specifically he called attention to the costumes, particularly the wide openings of the sleeves of the tunics worn by Fortuna and the figure on the top of her Wheel, a fashion characteristic of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; and to the lettering of the inscriptions with its complicated ligatures and the "already clearly Gothic" form of the uncial "M." Other scholars who have written about the mosaic have added few new arguments. On the whole they have tended to agree with Toesca's dating,60 though A. Kingsley Porter proposed a date ca. 1105 A.D.61 While our mosaic clearly belongs to the large family of figured pavements of the Romanesque period, it appears to have no really close rela- tives even among those that have survived in the same geographic area. There is as yet no corpus of Italian medieval floor mosaics. But those known to me either in the original or from publications do not include any that I would with confidence claim as products of the same workshop. Therefore, it is not possible for the present to broaden the base on which to esta- blish the chronological limits of the period during which that workshop was active. A well-known pavement decoration in the crypt and chancel of the church of S. Savino in Piacenza comes relatively close to ours. MAore particularly the mosaic carpet in the chancel of that church re- calls the Turin floor not only by its position, the circular design at its center (which includes four figures attached to a "wheel" in a manner rem- iniscent of and perhaps intended to allude to a Wheel of Fortuna), and the variety and liveli- ness of its subject matter, but also by its free and rather agitated outline style.62 Whereas on many mosaic pavements draperies are rendered in a simplified manner, the artist at Piacenza, like his colleague in Turin, enlivens the surface 60 Gribaudi, op. cit., p. 627; P. Clemen, Die romanische Monumentalmalerei in den Rheinlanden (Dusseldorf, 1916), p. 183; Patetta, op. cit., p. 337 ff.; Olivero, op. cit. (supra, n. 21), p. 253. 61 Op. cit. (supra, n. 21) 3: p. 447. Porter's view was based on a general comparison with floors at S. Savino in Piacenza and S. Michele in Pavia. Neither of these floors, however, is securely dated (for S. Savino see infra, n. 62 f.). Kier, op. cit., passim, and Barral i Altet, op. cit. (supra, n. 18), p. 124, have accepted Porter's date. 62 La Regia Basilica di S. Savino in Piacenza (Piacenza, 1903), p. 47, fig. 11; A.

These characteristics, how- ever, appear at Turin in even more exaggerated form. In any case, the affinity does not help to settle the question of date, since firm chrono- logical evidence is lacking for the work at S. Savino just as it is for our floor.63 This is true also of the pavements of the Cathedral of Novara,64 pavements which might claim our particular attention on account of that city's geographic proximity to Turin. The church is said to have been consecrated in 1132,65 but we do not know whether this date applies to the floor decoration; and judgment here is further impeded by the deplorable condition of the mosaics. A fragmentary figure from the lost pavement of the nave, thought to be a personi- fication of Sol,66 is somewhat comparable to the figures inside the Wheel of Fortuna at Turin, but the style of the representations in the chancel, insofar as it can still be judged, appears to be more archaic.67 Interestingly enough, the com- position in the chancel includes personifications of winds, but in a rendering much simpler than that at Turin. Comparisons with other, more securely dated mosaic floors in Italy do, however, serve to rein- force the attribution of the Turin floor to the latter half or even the last third of the twelfth century. The pavement of S. Donato in Miurano, executed in 1141 in a combination of opus sectile and tesselated mosaic, displays, in the passages done in the latter technique, heraldically con- fronted animals, which, though not dissimilar to those in our mosaic, are much more severely styl- ized.68 We find a looser, more fluid, though still a good deal more controlled and less exuberant manner in a pavement at S. Benedetto Po (Poli- 63 Porter, op. cit. 3: p. 266 f., cites evidence for a con- secration of the church in 1107 A.D. There is no reason to believe that this date applies to the mosaic floors. 64 P.

SOC. rone) made in 1151 ;69 and we come fairly close to the Turin work with the floor of S. Prospero at Reggio Emilia (1160-1171), which includes grotesque masks quite similar to those on the rim of our Wheel of Fortuna.70 Despite its geo- graphic remoteness, I also quote the famous floor of the Cathedral of Otranto (1163-1165), because of the very free and lively outline style employed in the rendering of its figures and its characteristic snub-nosed profile heads not un- like those of the Turin winds.7' But in surveying the material one feels that the Turin floor may be still later than any of those I have mentioned and may, in fact, belong to the last decades of the twelfth century. Once we have a better knowledge of illuminated manuscripts made in northern Italy during that period-and in this field again there is a lack of adequate and fully illustrated basic publications-it may be possible to reinforce this dating with additional compari- sons. Although among published miniatures I have not found any close stylistic parallels for the Turin mosaic, Toesca was certainly right in drawing attention to the relationship which generally exists between the outline styles em- ployed in floor mosaics and those practiced in Italian regional scriptoria during the Roman- esque period. Meanwhile, some further support for the dating of our pavement can be gained from its inscriptions. In Paul Deschamps's systematic survey of medieval lapidary letter forms the uncial "M," already singled out by Toesca, has turned out to be indeed a valuable chronological indicator.72 The particular form employed by our mosaicist for the inscription of "Septemtrio," with the left and center strokes joined to form an "O" and the right-hand stroke turned inwards (fig. 7), is relatively infrequent. Deschamps's examples are in effect confined to the twelfth century, with those from northern Italy and southern France all concentrated in 69 Venturi, op. cit. 3: fig. 410 f.; Kier, op. cit., figs. 383- 385.

Our main con- cern will be its iconography. We shall try to identify the principal pictorial sources on which the designer drew, and we shall seek to under- stand his choice and combination of subjects in the perspective of the history of Christian floor decoration. III It makes good sense to begin our iconographic inquiry with the cartographic features of the mosaic. Not only are they extremely con- crete and explicit but they are clearly basic to the entire composition. The ocean encircling the earth is what the design as a whole repre- sents. Nor does the mosaic give merely a generalized expression to a geographic concept popular since ancient times and universally held during the Middle Ages.76 By placing islands in the ocean and labeling them, the artist makes it evident that he has actually used cartographic material and, indeed, wishes his design to be understood as a map. Let us therefore inquire first what his cartographic sources were and how far their influence on his composition extends. World maps of antiquity, insofar as they can be reconstructed from scanty evidence, and those of the Middle Ages often showed the all-em- bracing ocean surrounding the earth.77 Dis- 73 Ibid., pp. 41 (with n. 3), 43 f., 74. 74 Supra, p. 350: BRITANIE.

This particular com- bination of features is rare in the admittedly small corpus of extant maps that are chrono- logically pertinent. M\Iuch the closest parallels are among the maps normally included in the illuminated manuscripts of Beatus's Commen- tary on the Apocalypse.78 Even among the Beatus maps, however, only a few afford a really close comparison with our mosaic. While they normally show the ocean forming a regular frame around the earth, and islands schemati- cally shaped and inscribed with their names- within the ocean, the majority of these maps are tombes, Mappemondes A.D. 1200-1500, Imago Mundi, Supplement IV, i (Amsterdam, 1964). 78Miller, op. cit. 1: passim; 2: pls. 2-9.

Though winds are commonly represented or indicated on medieval world maps, few of the maps in Beatus manuscripts show this feature.80 In sum, no other single map known from early medieval times shares so many characteristics with our pavement as that in the Turin manuscript.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. mosaic of S. Salvatore. Unfortunately we do not know when the manuscript came to Turin. Its presence there cannot be traced back beyond the early eighteenth century.82 But in any event there is weighty evidence against the assump- tion that the map in the Turin manuscript or any of the other Beatus maps served as a model for our mosaic. Although the legends of the Beatus maps are also based largely on Isidorus of Seville,83 the selection of islands in the north- west sector-the only part of the ocean frame which we can compare-is not exactly the same as on the mosaic ;84 and their inscriptions are confined to names accompanied by the word "insula." It is, of course, possible to assume that the designer of our pavement, while using a Beatus map for his layout, went back to Isidorus's Etymologiae to procure fuller texts for his legends.85 But the same difficulty arises in aggravated form in connection with the winds. The Turin Beatus manuscript shows only four winds. Like the personifications of the main winds on our mosaic, they are full-length figures blowing horns. But they are seated astride inflated skins and have no inscriptions. A map in a Beatus manuscript in Paris shows outside the ocean frame eight half-length figures or busts blowing horns but again without inscriptions.86 Only the map of the famous Beatus manuscript from S. Sever is inscribed with the names of twelve winds.87 The scribe fol- lowed the Isidoran scheme which was used in our mosaic but did not add any of the texts explaining the qualities of the winds. Again it might be argued that the designer of the mosaic went back to the writings of Isidorus for supple- mentary information. But there are maps- albeit somewhat later in date than our mosaic- which do have fuller Isidoran legends for the winds; and legends, moreover, which combine in the same way as ours excerpts from both the Etymologiae and from De natura rerum. I refer to the Ebstorf and Hereford maps-two famous world maps of the thirteenth century-both of 82 Miller, op. cit. 1: p. 17. 83 Ibid., p. 63 ff. 84 The Turin map shows "B (r)itania," "Scotia," and "Tile," but omits the "Orcades" and has "Tantutes" (Thanet) instead (ibid., p. 40). The "Orcades" appear on the Burgo de Osma map (ibid., p. 36; cf. supra, n. 79). 85 Cf. supra, n. 31. 86 Paris, Bibl.

Nat., MS. lat. 8878; Miller, op. cit. 1: p. 42 f. and folding plate; Neuss, op. cit. 2: fig. 70. which have legends for winds strikingly similar to ours.88 It is likely, therefore, that our de- signer derived the bulk of his cosmographic material from a single source, namely, a world map which provided not only a pictorial model but also the texts for his inscriptions and which consequently must have had legends much fuller than those of the maps in Beatus manu- scripts.89 No extant map, however, provides fully ad- equate parallels for the actual rendering of the winds on our mosaic. I have already men- tioned the four figures in the corners of the Turin Beatus map riding on wind bags and the eight horn-blowers on the map of a Beatus manuscript in Paris. The latter, in part re- duced to representations of heads and of hands holding horns, are comparable to our "Aquilo" and "Circius" (figs. 3, 7) but leave our full- length figures unaccounted for. On the Hereford map the four nude grotesque figures in a squat- ting position which personify the main winds are reminiscent of the West Wind in Turin, but they 88 Miller, op. cit. 4: p. 7 f.

Crone (ed.), The World Map by Richard of Haldingham in Hereford Cathedral, Royal Geographical Society, Reproductions of Early Manuscript Maps, 3 (London, 1954). The legends of the winds on the Ebstorf map are mostly taken from the Etymologiae; those on the Hereford map combine quota- tions from the two works of Isidorus in a manner very similar to what we find on the Turin mosaic (cf. especially the legends for Circius). For the dates of the Ebstorf and Hereford maps see Destombes, op. cit. (supra, n. 77), pp. 194 ff., 197 ff. The Ebstorf map-also known as the Hannover map-was destroyed in World War II. 89 Mention should also be made, along with the Hereford and Ebstorf maps, of an interesting though poorly pre- served map discovered in 1908 in the Archivio Capitolare at Vercelli. Though it too is probably somewhat later in date than our mosaic-it has been attributed to the end of the twelfth or, more frequently, to the thirteenth cen- tury-its location in a city so close to Turin lends it potential interest for our inquiry. The history of this map is not known, though the suggestion has been made by C. F. Capello that it was brought to Vercelli in 1219. The earth is here depicted as nearly or fully circular. It is surrounded by a band-shaped ocean which contains numerous islands, including some with lengthy inscriptions. In the absence of a full publication it is difficult to judge the extent of the correspondence between this map and our mosaic-for one unusual detail both have in common see infra, p. 361-but the winds do not seem to figure on the Vercelli mappa mundi at all.

Not only are a number of dis- tinctive details of our wind personifications left unaccounted for, but in general our figures stand apart by being unusually active. Our de- signer has made every effort to indicate through postures and attitudes that large quantities of air are being circulated. In fact, "Aquilo" and "Circius" seem to be stirring up "tidal waves" in the ocean (fig. 3). I know of no other medieval world map with anthropomorphic winds which shows these figures so closely and actively in- tegrated into the cosmic scheme. As we shall see later, our artist had special reasons for em- phasizing their active role and may for this purpose have introduced motifs that were not in his map model. We may recall here also the irregularity in the use of frames and the placing of inscriptions which we encountered in the rep- resentations of the West Wind and his satellites.93 This too suggests that in the design of the wind spandrels the artist may have exercised a certain amount of independence vis-a-vis his map model. T his does not mean that any of his figures of winds were free inventions. Once we extend our search beyond the field of cartography a number of characteristic features of the personi- fied winds on our mosaic fall into place quite readily.

This is true not only of the examples in maps already cited 100 but also of other cosmo- graphic diagrams and schemes.10' In a number of Apocalypse illustrations, however, and es- pecially in the Beatus group, a conflation takes place whereby the four draped angels that are meant to "hold" the Winds of the Earth (in the form of heads held in their hands)102 themselves become the winds mightily blowing air, with or without the help of horns.'03 To these angelic winds, of which the famous ceiling paintings at Zillis provide another twelfth-century example,104 our "Septemtrio" may be compared. And, curiously enough, it is once again the Turin manuscript of Beatus which affords the best parallel: the angels in the illustration of Apoc. 7, 1-3, in that manuscript are quite close to our figure not only in their costumes but also in their postures.'05 Some features of our winds, however, seem to be pure caprice. I know of no set of wind personifications in whlich the west winds are singled out by being rendered as black men (fig. 8). All winds may, of course, appear black when depicted in silhouette, as they are on a Roman mosaic floor at Ostia 106 and a medieval one at Novara.107 But in our case the blackness appears to be selective and descriptive.

This fanciful contrivance apparently is meant to add further to the impression that large and powerful air currents are being set in motion.'09 Our conclusion, then, is that the designer of the Turin mosaic must have had before him a world map rather like that of the Turin Beatus manuscript in layout and appearance but more nearly resembling a map such as the later one at Hereford in its lengthy legends excerpted from Isidorus. While this model may also have in- cluded representations of all the twelve winds in anthropomorphic form, in the rendering of these personifications our artist seems to have exer- cised a certain amount of independence, one of 108 According to Isidorus, De natura rerum, XXXVII, 1, it is the northeast wind (Aquilo or Boreas) which assumes the form of a devil (Fontaine, p. 295). In a Byzantine Job manuscript of the thirteenth century in the Vatican Library the "great wind" which destroys Job's sons and daughters (Job 1, 19) is depicted as a black winged devil (MS. Vat. gr. 1231, fol. 40v). On a miniature in the Heidelberg manuscript of the Liber Scivias of Hildegard of Bingen all four of the principal winds have the appear- ance of devils, though they are not black (see supra, n. 101). 109 In studying this detail I have had the generous help of Dr. Emanuel Winternitz of the Metropolitan Museum, New York, the unrivaled authority on the history of musical instruments and their representation in art. Dr. Winternitz informs me that while our North Wind's triple horn shows certain realistic features, such as the uneven curvature of the lower of the two large horns, as a whole it is utterly unfunctional and corresponds to no traditional or generally used instrument. He has drawn my attention to the relevant material assembled by E. Buhle (Die musikalischen Instrumente in den Miniaturen des friihen Mittelalters 1 [Leipzig, 19031) and has pointed out to me that even a relatively simpler and more plausible looking instrument such as that Buhle reproduces from a tenth-century manuscript in Paris (Bibl. Nat., MS. lat. 7900A; see third folding plate, under "4. Krummer Zink") has no basis in reality. That instrument looks like a double horn (as distinct from two separate horns blown simultaneously, which are not uncommon) and is con- sidered by Dr. Winternitz to be either a misunderstood aulos or entirely fantastic (see also Buhle, p. 24, n. 2). A fortiori our triple horn must be wholly imaginary. Dr. Winternitz suggests that it is meant to be "allegorical, perhaps indicating the power of the wind," a conclusion fully in keeping with my overall interpretation of the winds on the Turin pavement. I am very much indebted to Dr. Winternitz for the trouble he took to clear up this question for me.</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 117, NO. 5, 1973] WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL 361 his purposes being to make them appear as active as possible. Let us now turn to the area within the ocean border where the map design was completely transformed. No doubt this dissembling was deliberate. I have previously cited the abstract patterns of opus sectile floors as a comparison for the system of circles that organizes the entire surface of our mosaic.'10 One gets the impres- sion that the artist wished to avoid too open a display of "scientific" geography. He neatly equated his theme with a conventional and familiar decorative design that can be enjoyed as a pattern before the beholder, on closer in- spection, discovers its highly articulate content. Within the circular area that stands for the earth the decorative element at first sight seems to predominate entirely. But actually the ambiguity between map and pattern continues. It is true that the roundels with animals (figs. 3, 4, 5, 9, 10), particularly those in which quad- rupeds or birds are displayed in heraldic pairs, appear to be purely ornamental. Derived directly or indirectly from the repeat patterns of Byzantine or Islamic silk weavings,111 they be- long to the stock repertory of medieval pave- ment decoration.112 But let us remember that animals of various kinds, including many fan- tastic ones, are commonly displayed also on medieval maps to denote the fauna of various countries. In all probability the animals in our mosaic are meant to allude to this convention. They are map symbols in disguise. The ele- phant with his castle appears on the Hereford map as a symbol for India and the accompanying text refers to the Indians' military use of towers mounted on elephants."3 The griffin is depicted as an inhabitant of Scythia on both the Hereford and Ebstorf maps.1"4 Lions are associated with a variety of countries.-"' And is it altogether fanciful to suggest that the splendid figure of a 110 Supra, n. 30.

But in a generalized way not only the animals in the eight circles but also the various figures in the outer spandrels formed by these circles may be taken to stand for the creatures that people the earth. Among the motifs in the outer spandrels we may single out the mermaid and the rider with a whip (figs. 5, 9, 10). The latter strikingly recalls the figure of "Philip, King of France" depicted on a map of the late twelfth or, more probably, the thirteenth century in the Archivio Capitolare in Vercelli as an emblem next to the Atlas mountain.117 Both this map and the Hereford map also fea- ture mermaids.1"8 The eight horned masks in the inner spandrels, on the other hand, may allude once more to the winds (figs. 3, 4, 11). In certain Apocalypse illustrations winds are rep- resented as horned heads;"19 and we may also recall in this connection the eight animal heads distributed over the rim of the earth on the Hereford map to represent the secondary winds.120 Cartographic conventions and allusions are left behind once and for all as we reach the inner circle gripped by these masks. But far from being content with mere ornamentation, the artist here has imposed on the design another very specific theme. In rendering this inner circle as a Wheel of Fortuna he has enriched and complicated his image of the world in an un- expected manner. To this seemingly extraneous subject we must now address ourselves. IV By the time our mosaic w-as made, the image of man ascending and descending on Fortuna's 116 This interpretation was suggested to me by Dr. Mary K. Donaldson.

Its literary pro- genitor was Boethius, the scholar and statesman of the early sixth century, who in his Consola- tion of Philosophy had gained for the discredited Roman "Allerweltsgottin" (Doren) a new lease on life by making her in effect an agent of divine Providence. A whleel or sphere had long figured in literature and art as her symbol, attribute, or support. But it was Boethius who more clearly and graphically than earlier writers visualized her with a wheel as an instrument which she turns capriciously and on which man ascends and descends."'l Although the Consola- 121 Boethii Philosophiae Consolatio, II, 2, 9 ff. (ed. L. Bieler, Corpus Christianorum, ser. lat., 94 [Turnhout, tion of Philosophy had been copied, read, and commented on extensively since the Carolingian period,122 apparently it was not until the eleventh century that Boethius's vivid image was rendered in visual terms. The time lag has not so far been fully explained.'23 It is also worth noting that of the early pictorial representations of Fortuna's Wheel which have come down to us, none is associated with Boethius's text. But whatever the circumstances were that gave rise to it, the image once created quickly gained favor. The earliest known example is a miniature in an eleventh-century manuscript at Monte Cassino, of which detailed descriptions have long been available though it has been reproduced only recently (fig. 13).124 The volume contains a miscellany of computistic writings, including Boethius's De arithmetica (pp. 1-132) and Ger- bert of Aurillac's De numerorum divisione (pp. 132-144). The miniature occupies the verso of a folio (p. 146) and is followed by excerpts from Isidorus's Etymologiae on the subject of the liberal arts 125 and by the first chapter of Bede's De temporum ratione. The latter text is ac- companied by illustrations in the same style as the Wheel of Fortuna and clearly by the same hand. The excerpts from Isidorus which begin on the recto page facing our miniature (p. 147) are preceded on that page by a poem of sixteen lines which has to do wvitlh the vicissitudes of 1957], p. 20).

But miniature and poem evidently belong to- gether; and there is no reason to doubt that the former is an original and integral part of the manuscript.'27 At the same time, it gives the impression of an experiment rather than a mere reproduction of an already established formula. As a matter of fact, there is an unfinished ver- sion on the preceding recto page (p. 145) which differs in a number of details and which evi- dently was abandoned (fig. 14). In both ver- sions the figure on top is extraordinarily large in relation to the "wheel" or circle, as though the artist had in mind ancient representations of Kairos or Fortuna in which a wheel or sphere served as a palpably unstable support for the god or goddess.'28 But in adding three other figures, albeit of smaller size, and showing them clinging to or plowed under by the wheel, he made it clear that the figure on top is to be understood as a participant in the dismal cycle of man's vicissitudes and the wheel as the instrument of his rise and fall in Boethius's sense; and here already all four figures are accompanied by their characteristic inscriptions ("Regnabo/ Regno/Regnavi/Sum sine regno") 129 in addi- tion to other appropriate texts."0 The basic iconographic concept, then, is firmly established in this miniature. In the final version (though not in the preliminary one) the figure on top is characterized as a king with a crown and a long staff or sceptre,'3' while the bottom figure is semi-nude as in our mosaic. The only essential element that is lacking is the figure of Fortuna herself. Her absence may be another sign that the group was developed out of an image of the goddess (or her male counterpart) standing on a sphere or wheel. The crowned figure on top may have taken her place. Wheels with figures revolving on their rims but without Fortuna subsequently made their 126 Ibid., p. 83. 127 It cannot, therefore, have served originally as an illustration of the Consolation of Philosophy as Courcelle suggests (op. cit., p. 141). 128 An influence of that iconography was suggested by Courcelle (op. cit., p. 142; cf. also ibid., pl. 66, for a twelfth- century example). 129 Cf.

Otherwise, however, a personification of fickle fortune becomes in this period a normal part of the composition. For our purpose it is relevant to note two basic variants in the position as- signed to her. Fortuna may either be placed beside the wheel and rotate it and its occupants from the outside, sometimes with the help of a crank; or else she herself may be within the wheel as in our mosaic. Of the latter type there are some well-known examples belonging to the first half of the thirteenth century, notably a drawing in the Album of Villard de Honnecourt133 and a miniature in the 'Munich manuscript of the Carmina Burana (fig. 15).'34 In the twelfth Verona, S. Zeno, West Fagade (Porter, op. cit. [supra, n. 21] 3: pp. 526, 537 f.; 4: pl. 224, fig. 1; W. Arslan, L'architettura romanica veronese [Verona, 1939], pp. 190, 202 and pl. 111; A. da Lisca, La.

Eschapasse, Notre-Dame d'A miens [Paris, 1960], pl. 68; Courcelle, op. cit., pl. 70); end of thirteenth century (Eschapasse, p. 110). Each one of these windows poses problems of interpreta- tion, partly because of poor preservation or later restora- tions. All certainly have to do with the Fortuna theme, and in the case of the Verona window an inscription testifies to the fact (cf. supra, n. 28). But Fortuna herself does not seem to have been represented in any of these examples, and in this sense they perpetuate the tradition of the Monte Cassino illumination. The figure on the top of the Beauvais window has been called Fortuna (H. J. Dow, "The Rose-Window," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 20 [1957]: p. 269), but the interpre- tation is not convincing. On the other hand, a thirteenth- century rose window on the north transept fagade of the Cathedral of Trent shows in the center a sculptured figure which may well be Fortuna (Van Marle, op. cit. [supra, n. 97], fig. 217; B. Passamani, La scultura romanicadel Trentino [Trent, 1963], p. 88 ff. and figs. 40-46). H. R. Hahnloser has suggested that the drawing of Villard de Honnecourt which shows Fortuna in the center of her wheel was likewise intended as a design for a rose window; for this see the next footnote. 133 H.

Hahnloser appears to be the only scholar to have made a point of distinguishing between the two iconographic types. Observing that the variant with Fortuna inside the wheel pre- vailed generally in the thirteenth century, he speaks of a more abstract as against a more mechanistic and realistic rendering of the theme."36 This may well be a correct interpretation in some instances. Fortuna placed in the center of the composition may be meant to be in control of her nefarious game no less clearly -if more symbolicallv-than when she is shown operat- ing an actual machine. But in other instances- and especially when she is seen grasping the spokes or frame of the wheel from the inside, as on our mosaic-perhaps this rendering too should be read realistically, the implication being that she herself is about to be rotated. Lest this interpretation be rejected as unduly literal, I quote a well-known twelfth-century text which has often been cited as a contemporary com- mentary on the subject of Fortuna's Wheel and which spells out this notion in so many words. Honorius Augustodunensis (ca. 1080-ca. 1137), in a sermon in which he enumerates various figures and stories from Greek mythology that can be used to good advantage in Christian moralistic teaching, gives as his first example the following: Scribunt itaque philosophi quod mulier rotae innexa jugiter circumferatur; cujus caput nunc in alta erigatur, nunc in ima demergatur. Rota haec quae volvitur est gloria hujus mundi quae jugiter circumfertur. Mulier rotae innexa est fortuna gloriae intexta. Hujus caput aliquando sursum, aliquando fertur deorsum, quia plerique multocies potentia et divitiis exaltantur, saepe egestate et miseriis exalliantur [siC].137 Some scholars 138 have claimed that in this passage Honorius must have had in mind Boethius, despite the fact that in the context of his sermon the "philosophers" to whom he refers should be pagans. On the other hand, it has cit., pl. 6a and pp. 190 f., 215; G. Cames, Alle'gories et symboles dans l'Hortus Deliciarum [Leiden, 1971], p. 86 f., fig. 79; see also infra, p. 368 f). In the Manchester, Schul- pforta and Hortus miniatures Fortuna is shown operating the wheel by means of a crank. 136 Op. cit., p. 128 f. 137 Honorius Augustodunensis, Speculum Ecclesiae, Dominica XI post Pentecosten (Migne, Patrologia Latina, 172, col. 1057). On the dates of Honorius see H. Men- hardt, in: Zeitschrift fur deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur 89 (1958): p. 23 ff., esp. p. 67 ff. The passage on Fortuna was included by Herrad of Landsberg in her florilegium; cf. Cames, op. cit., p. 86. 138 E. MAle, L'art religieux du XIIIe siedcle en France (Paris, 1919), p. 119, n. 2; Courcelle, op. cit., p. 136. also been suggested that the image he so vividly conjures up is based on a tradition distinct from Boethius.139 Whatever Honorius's source, for our purposes the interesting point is that in literature there was in the twelfth century a variant of the Fortuna motif in which she does not turn the wheel, as Boethius had described, but is herself turned writhin it. In the pictorial arts our mosaic appears to be the earliest extant example to show Fortuna within the wheel. Surely the type was not the invention of our artist. Its popularity in the immediately ensuing period suggests that more widely accessible exempla must have existed by this time. Indeed, one may wonder whether Honorius would have written as graphically as he did had there not been pictorial representa- tions of the "mulier rotae innexa" even in his day. But the type can hardly have been com- mon in the twelfth century. Its use by the Turin designer will be seen to make excellent sense once we have considered the context in which the Fortuna theme appears in this in- stance. The context is unique in medieval art. I know of no other example of Fortuna's Wheel being combined with a world map.140 Again we need not assume a total lack of precedents. Indeed, it may not seem likely on a priori grounds that our artist was the first ever to put the two themes together. But in the absence of any known model he may have followed, we must leave the question open. What we can say-and this is ultimately more important-is that the combination is far from haphazard. It has its roots in a set of concepts which can be identified with some accuracy. There is first of all the important fact that the earth itself had long been likened to a wheel. No other than Isidorus of Seville had thus de- scribed its shape. Having devoted Book XIII of his Etymologiae to the universe (mundus), 139 Patch, op. cit. (supra, n. 121), p. 152 ff. 140 The most nearly analogous case of which I am aware is Henry III's decoration of the hall of his palace at Win- chester, which included both a Wheel of Fortuna and a world map. But the two works were commissioned at different times (in 1236 and 1239 respectively) and there is no evidence that they were pendants. See Tristram, op. cit. (supra, n. 134), pp. 180, 610. MS. 66 in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, contains both a world map (cf. supra, n. 91) and a representation of Fortuna with her Wheel (cf. supra, n. 135), but the manuscript is a miscellany and the two miniatures are associated with entirely differ- ent texts; see M.

SOC. which he envisaged as a globe in perpetual motion,'41 he turns in Book XIV to the earth, situated in the midst of the universe. He ex- plains that terra, in the singular, is synonymous with orbis and likens the latter to a wheel ("Orbis . . . sicut rota est").'42 Although he had spoken of the force of the winds as great enough to bring turbulence not only to heaven and the seas, but also to the earth,'43 there is no doubt that Isidorus thought of the earth as essentially immobile and that in comparing it with a wheel he had in mind its shape. In- deed, the notion that the earth stood firm in the center of the universe was hardly ever chal- lenged scientifically throughout the ensuing half- millennium.144 But-and this is an important step in the direction of the image in which we are interested-the comparison with the wheel lent itself to an allegorical elaboration. Walafrid Strabo in the ninth century concludes a poem in which he bemoans the separation from a friend with a general reflection on the misery of this world: . . . dolor est possessio mundi, Quaeque serena putas, magis haec in nubila tristes Et tenebras fugiunt; volucri qui pendet in orbe Nunc scandit, nunc descendit, rota sic trahit orbis.'45 Trhe reference to man's rising and falling shows that the primary inspiration for this verse was Boethius's allegory of Fortuna's Wheel.'46 But the author appears to make use of a poet's license in alluding at the same time to Isidorus's 141 Etymologiae (ed.

M. Parent, La doctrine de la creation dans l'icole de Chartres [Paris and Ottawa, 1938], p. 126 f.; cf. Courcelle, op. cit., p. 307). The anonymous writer of a late twelfth-century treatise on the elements does, however, reckon at least with the theoretical possi- bility that the earth might rotate (R. C. Dales, "Anonymi De elementis: From a Twelfth Century Collection of Scientific Works in British Museum MS Cotton Galba E. IV," Isis, 56 [1965]: p. 174 ff., especially pp. 177 f., 184).

Surely no scientific theory concerning the rotation of the earth is involved. It is rather a writer's fancy that here seems to set Isidorus's wheel in motion to rein- force a reflection on the transitoriness of the things of this world. The rota Fortunae blends into the orbis terrae. This is the germ of the idea which centuries later found a visual realiza- tion in our mosaic. There were certain factors which facilitated a correlation between a wheel-shaped earth and Boethius's rotating wheel. Psalm 76 (77), verse 19 (18), speaks of "the voice of thy thunder" in the wheel: Vox tonitrui tui in rota. Illuxerunt coruscationes tuae orbi terrae; Commota est et contremuit terra. Strictly speaking, the wheel here is the seat of the Deity distinct from the orbis terrae; and representations of "God in the Wheel" do, in fact, exist.'47 But the artist who illustrated the verse in the Utrecht Psalter-a near contem- porary of Walafrid Strabo-depicted the wheel at the Lord's feet and fiercely blowing winds be- side it.148 The example shows how easily the rota of the first sentence of the verse could become the orbis terrae of the second. A wheel-shaped earth may thus be thought of as being in a state of commotion. More important still perhaps is a familiar semantic confusion-easily documented in litera- ture-between mundus or the universe, on the one hand, and the orbis terrae on the other.149 Our own loose usage whereby we refer to either as "the world" ("Welt," "monde") in common parlance illustrates the point. Now while the earth is static the universe, as Isidorus tells us, is in perpetual motion; and, rhetorically, this rotating "world" can easily become confounded with our terrestial world. Once again I cite Honorius Augustodunensis who, in a com- mentary on the Psalm verse just quoted, writes as follows: Per rotam hic mundus figuratur qui celeri cir- cuitione ut rota jugiter volutatur.150 47 Dow, op. cit.

The fact that he sees it in fast and perpetual motion-and the words he uses are strikingly similar to those which in the sermon previously cited he applies to Fortuna's Wheel-would suggest that he has in mind the universe in Isidorus's sense. Yet in that sense the wheel simile would hardly be appropriate; it applies more properly to the orbis terrae. Is not the latter, in fact, what is meant here pri- marily by "hic mundus"? 151 In his poem De contemptu mundi, Bernard of Cluny ("Bernard of Morval"), who flourished about 1150, took an important step further on the same path. Again mundus is compared to a revolving wheel, but the term is here used in effect as a synonym for orbis; pictorial repre- sentations of "the world" are cited; and the whole forms part of a lamentation over the instability of things. It is the same note that Walafrid Strabo had struck centuries earlier, but now with a much more explicit reference to the physical world, including even its depiction in circular form: Orbis honos ruit, et fugit, et fluit orbe dierum. Ut rota volvitur, indeque pingitur ut rota mundus, Quippe volubilis et variabilis ac ruibundus.152 Had the poet introduced into his plaint the figure of Fortuna personified, his verses might almost have served as an epigraph for the Turin floor. A few decades later another poet who was geographically much closer to the designer of our mosaic did, in fact, introduce Fortuna into a work of similar tenor. Henry of Settimello, whose Elegia was written in or near Florence in 1193-1194 (that is to say, very close to the time when our mosaic was probably made), was deeply influenced by Boethius. Like the latter he has Fortuna speak in the first person; and, as Pierre Courcelle has remarked,153 he is literally obsessed with the Boethian image of her turning lher wheel. But what is particularly interesting 151 It should be noted, however, that Honorius, along with many scientific writers of his age, knew of the spheric- ity of the earth, so that the simile of the wheel is not entirely appropriate in any case; cf. De imagine mundi, 1, 5 (Migne, Patrologia Latina, 172, col. 122). See Wright, op. cit. (supra, n. 76), p. 152, and, for the authorship, Menhardt, op. cit. (supra, n. 137), p. 68 f. 152 Bernard of Morval, De contemptu mundi, 980-982 (ed. H. C. Hoskier [London, 1929], p. 33 f.). 153 Op. cit., p. 136 f. to us is that Henry's Fortuna speaks of the orbis [terrae] and the ocean encircling it as her proper domain where she may legitimately pur- sue her art: Ast ego, que dea sum, qua nulla potentior orbe, Quem ligat Occeani circulus orbe suo, Nonne meam licite, stultissime, prosequar artem? Sic opus est ut te precipitando rotem.'54 This too might be a text for our mosaic, though, as we shall see, its designer probably would not have been willing to grant Fortuna the status of a goddess-if only a self-styled one-with unlimited power on earth. No doubt texts such as these provide a con- ceptual framework for our mosaic and illuminate the intellectual and spiritual climate in which it was created. Meditations on the vanity of earthly things were very much in vogue in the period in which it was made.155 Someone-either the designer of the Turin pavement or a predecessor -had the idea of putting Fortuna's Wheel, which was, as we have seen, no longer an unusual iconographic motif by this time, on a mappa mundi so as to characterize the earth as a scene of vain pursuits. In a sense the motif was intro- duced here as another cartographic symbol like the animals and other motifs surrounding it on the "earth's" surface.'56 But something more is involved. We have seen that the variant of the Fortuna image showing the personification in- side the wheel rather than on the outside was not common at the time. While not likely to be our artist's invention, it may well have been created first for a context such as this. In any case, it makes for the closest possible integration between the rota Fortunae and the orbis terrae. Com- pletely fusing circle into circle, wheel into wheel, the artist has linked the two literally and indissolubly. He has created a visual equiv- alent to the rhetorical similes of the poets and has imparted to their message an extraordinary palpability. Admittedly a modern observer, thinking in Copernican terms, risks an ana- 154 Henry of Settimello, Elegia, II, 105-108 (ed. G. Cremaschi [Bergamo, 1949], p. 52). 155 See, in general, F.

To him the earth will almost automatically rotate, along with Fortuna's wheel. But in the light of the texts I have quoted it may well be that even in the eyes of a twelfth-century beholder the two rotae were linked not merely in terms of shape but also-at least emotionally and irrationally-in terms of movement.'57 It must in any case be granted that the motion of Fortuna's wheel is not here thought of as freely and autonomously governed by the "goddess" herself. She is depicted not as a sovereign power, but rather as the "mulier rotae innexa" of whom Honorius had written and who, in another instant, may well have her head turned upside down.'58 The personified winds blowing so vigorously from the four corners will see to this. Although we have found these personifications to be a traditional and conven- tional feature of world maps, we have also seen that in this instance some of them are unusually active ;159 and we are surely meant to understand that they impart motion to Fortuna's wheel. Here again one can point to literary sources in which there was a long-standing association be- tween fortune and the winds. Boethius's Fortuna refers to them, though only by way of a simile to illustrate her own powers and the inevitability of constant change.'60 The same comparison is made in a poem which Herrad of Landsberg, a contemporary of our artist, included in her Hortus Deliciarum;161 while Alanus ab Insulis, another contemporary, in a graphic description of Fortuna's abode, assigns a conspicuous role to the winds blowing around her house.'62 No doubt, the beholder of our mosaic must have been meant to understand that Fortuna was not fully in control of her wheel, and the icono- graphic type was chosen with this in mind. The rotation of the wheel is at the mercy of the winds and at least to this extent subject to cosmic forces. To this same extent, however, the rota Fortunae may certainly be said to be correlated 157 "The thought of the artist is clear. This world of ours, surrounded by the ocean . . . , is but the revolving Wheel of Fortune raising men up to the acme of power, or casting them down to the extreme of misery" (Porter, op. cit.

Let it be recalled that even the static earth of medieval science was thought capable of being shaken by the winds.'63 It is interesting, in concluding these observa- tions, to compare the Turin mosaic with another nearly contemporary rendering of Fortuna's Wheel. The Hortts Deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg contained not only the poem just referred to but also a miniature which was cited earlier among the examples of what we have seen to be the normal iconography of Fortuna in the twelfth century (fig. 16).164 It is, in fact, one of the instances in which the "goddess" is placed outside the wheel and shown turning it with the help of a crank. The wheel with its six occu- pants is mounted on an axle to which the crank is attached and whose ends are placed in the forked tops of two posts placed on hillocks. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this repre- sentation except the fact that Fortuna, a regal figure wearing a crown, practices her art from the top of a mountain which rises behind the left- hand post. And what is particularly interesting in our context is that this mountain, on which her ornate throne rests, is inscribed "terra." It is the only other medieval instance known to me in which the earth is explicitly featured in con- nection with Fortuna and graphically depicted as the latter's abode. In this sense Herrad's "I See supra, n. 143; cf. also Hildegard of Bingen, Scivias, Visio III (Migne, Patrologia Latina, 197, col. 404C). 164 See supra, n. 135.</page><page sequence="26">VOL. 117, NO. 5, 1973] WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL 369 miniature is a close relative indeed, the only close relative-of the Turin mosaic. But the manner of conveying the idea could hardly be more different. Herrad's representation avoids all cosmological problems and ambiguities. The earth is firm and immovable. It is to the "world" (mundus) that the rotating wheel may be compared, as the verse inscribed on its axle explains ("sicut rota volvitur sic mundus in- stabili cursu variatur"). But the picture is not without problems of its own. Fortuna ap- pears as an absolute and wholly autonomous mistress of the earth. To explore the philo- sophical and theological implications of such a rendering is beyond the scope of the present study (to say nothing of its author's lack of competence in this area). But it can hardly be denied that such implications are present; and they could well have given pause to a twelfth- century observer.165 There is not even, as in some other representations of the period, a countervailing force in the guise of other person- ifications ("Virtutes," "Sapientia") with whom Fortuna must contend for power.'66 Further- more, in a purely visual sense the correlation between Fortuna and the earth is weak. Perhaps one can best sum up the essence of the Turin composition by saying that its designer addressed himself to these problems. Fortuna has been dethroned. Depicted as part of a cosmic system, she herself has become a play- thing subject to greater forces. At the same time, the identification of her domain with the earth is made visually palpable to a degree far greater than that which the Hortus miniature was able to convey. But the Turin artist, too, paid a price. His rendering ran counter to accepted views and everyday experience of the physical world. A literary play on the words mundus- orbis-rota was one thing; a near equation of an actual map of the earth with a rotating wheel was quite another. A medieval beholder, know- ing the earth to be firmly placed in the center of the universe, could not instinctively accept such an equation in his mind as a modern observer can. On the contrary, there must have been for him an inherent contradiction between what science and experience taught him and the artist's in- 16" For a critical voice raised in the twelfth century against Boethius's use of the Fortuna motif see Courcelle, op. cit., p. 343. 166 Bern MS. of Peter of Eboli, fols. 146r, 147r; Cam- bridge, Corpus Christi College, MS. 66, p. 66. Cf. supra, n. 135. terpretation of these data. The very matter-of- factness of the image, the "scientific" quality of at least that part of the composition which is rendered as a piece of undisguised cartography, must have put a considerable strain on his imagination. This surely explains why the design remained without a future. On the other hand, it is perhaps no accident that the one example we have is on a floor, for in this position it does have a particular meaning and a peculiar rele- vance. To complete our study we must finally return to the history of Christian floor decora- tion with which we started and view the Turin mosaic in the perspective of that history. V With a map of the world as its basic element, the Turin mosaic belongs to a category of geo- graphic and cosmographic representations for which there was ample precedent in Christian pavement decoration of an earlier age. Repre- sentations of this kind were part of the rich store of subjects which had appeared in the floor mosaics of early churches as an inheritance from pagan antiquity.'67 They first became prominent in a vogue of increasingly exuberant pictorial elaboration which can be observed in church pavements in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean during the fifth century; and they reached a peak of frequency, complexity, and "scientific" explicitness in the period during and after the reign of Justinian (527-565).168 The largest number of floors of that period dis- playing these and other "encyclopedic" sub- jects has been found in the excavations of churches in Palestine and Syria, but there are others in other parts of what was then the Byzantine domain. Three examples are particu- larly interesting in our context. A famous mosaic pavement in a church at Madaba (in present-day Jordan), well known to all students of early cartography, takes the shape of an actual map with a detailed representation of Palestine and parts of Egypt, complete with elaborate legends.169 A floor in the church of St. 167 See supra, P. 344 f. 168 Kitzinger, op. cit.

In rendering the ocean but not the earth cartographically, the Turin mosaic occupies a position midway between the pure cartography of the floor at Madaba and the exclusively decorative composition of that at Nikopolis. Like the latter, it can be described in essence as a decorator's paraphrase of a world map.'73 If the few stylized trees and birds in the Nikopolis emblema are meant to represent "everything that breathes and creeps," as the inscription says in a literal quotation from Homer, so can the much richer but even more formalized display of living beings inside the ocean frame at Turin. Pictorial map symbols always function on a pars pro toto principle. Both the Greek mosaicist of the sixth century and his successor in twelfth-century Italy made use of this method to present a view of the world with the help of the stock vocabulary of his craft. I have said earlier that on general grounds there is no likcelihood of a direct influence of the imagery of Early Clhristian and Early Byzantine floor mosaics on that of Romanesque ones.174 So far as our particular instance is concerned, the geograplhic lore which the T urin artist incorporated in his work, tlhough of ancient origin, had been funneled through the compendia of Isidorus of Seville and his countless medieval excerptors before it reached the Turin designer. His pictorial devices, too, are specifically medi- eval. Striking as the similarity of theme and method is, the Nikopolis and Turin floors must be looked upon as independent creations. The depiction of earth and ocean at Nikopolis and the whole group of cosmograplhic floor mosaics to which it belongs do, hiowever, pro- vide an illuminating foil against which to view the Turin composition. As I have shown in an earlier study,'75 the flowering of this encyclopedic subject matter on sixth-century church floors in the eastern Mediterranean region coincides with a reevaluation of the entire world of the senses under the influence of that mysterious late fifth-century author who wrote under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. The Christianized Neoplatonism of these writings, proclaimed under the authority of St. Paul's Athenian dis- ciple, exerted an enormous impact on Byzantine religious thinking. The physical world became 173 Cf. Kitzinger, op. cit. (supra, n. 170), p. 106. 174 Cf. supra, P. 345 f. 175 Op. cit.

This "anagogical" approach-the idea of the sensible as a means of attaining to the intelligible-was promptly ap- plied to the church building and its fittings. The architecture of the church was interpreted as an image of the cosmos; and the cosmos in turn stood for divine "Essence." 176 The symbolism was made even more explicit when early in the seventh century MViaximus the Confessor, further developing the same line of thought, equated the nave of the church with the physical world and the sanctuary with the spiritual.177 The concept justified and, indeed, encouraged a purely factual and "scientific" representation of nature subjects within the building; and the floor unsuitable for sacred images in any case- became an obvious carrier for such representa- tions. Pictorial decoration of the church floor first truly came into its own here. Without risking desecration, without even implying esoteric religious references, the artist was able to deploy on the floor a rich array of images. Secular iconography in and by itself came to have a racison d'etre in the house of God. And when the floor took the shape of a map, its decoration was doubly meaningful. In this guise it could help most directly to express the role of the building as an image of the cosmos. The visitor literally stepped on the earth, just as the dome or ceiling above him might, and often did, represent or suggest heaven.'78 Pre- cisely the image of the earth surrounded by the ocean which the floor at Nikopolis (and centuries 176 See a Syriac hymn on the Cathedral of Edessa (ibid., p. 220 f.), now available in English translation (C. Mango, The Art of the Byzantine Empire 312-1453, Sources and Documents in the History of Art Series [H. W. Janson, ed., Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1972], p. 57 ff.). The hymn entails a dual interpretation of the church building, which it proclaims to be a representation of the mysteries of divine Essence and divine Dispensation (verse 3); the first interpretation is carried through in terms of cosmog- raphy (verses 4-8), the second in Biblical and theological terms (verses 11-19); see A. Grabar, in: Cahiers arche- ologiques 2 (1947): p. 41 ff., especially p. 54 ff. For the "anagogical" interpretation of church fittings see a text of Hypatius of Ephesus (ca. 530-540 A.D.) which I have dis- cussed in: Dumbarton Oaks Papers 8 (1954): p. 138 (cf. also J. Gouillard, in: Revue des etudes byzantines 19 [1961]: p. 63 ff., especially p. 72 ff.). 177 Maximus Confessor, Mystagogia, ch. 3 (Migne, Patrologia Graeca, 91, col. 672); cf. H.-J.

The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were the peak period of a second and far more compre- hensive effort to integrate nature and science into a Christian world view. Centered in the Latin West, this effort is reflected above all in the great summae, "mirrors," and encyclopedic treatises which then had their heyday. Less concerned than their Byzantine counterparts with direct symbolic relevance, and intent, on the other hand, on a systematic coordination of all knowledge, Western scholars ranged more broadly, deeply, and freely over the phenomena of the physical world. By the same token, sub- jects from the encyclopedia of nature and science came to play during this period a conspicuous role in church art in general. One need only think of the sculptured decor of Romanesque and early Gothic cathedrals, in which much space is given to these secular representations alongside the figures and events from sacred history.'80 Again, however, it was the floor that offered a peculiarly suitable home for the secular category; and the new flow ering during this period of pictorial floor mosaic as a craft, already referred to in the introduction to this study, may in fact be due in part to this circumstance. At any rate, beginning in the eleventh century the church floor became once more a frequent and conspicuous carrier of images pertaining to the encyclopedia of nature and science, witness a long list of examples in France, Germany, and Italy.'8' Curiously enough, within this category of Romanesque floor decorations specifically geo- graphic themes are not very common.182 A mosaic in the church of St. Remi at Reims, destroyed in the eighteenth century and known only from descriptions, included in its rich encyclopedic program personifications of "Terra, 179 See the hymn cited in n. 176 (Mango, op. cit., p. 58, verse 4). 180 E.

Mare" and "Orbis terrae." 183 Fragmentary church pavements at Lyons and Saint-Paul- Trois-Ch,teaux contain representations of cities ;184 while another at Casale Monferrato displays among its varied subjects some of those strange creatures which according to the notions of medieval geographers inhabited the less acces- sible parts of the world.185 We may mention also representations of the terrestial paradise, an integral part of medieval geography which was represented on a number of floors.'86 But none of these pavements present any cartographic features pure and undisguised. In this respect the only true parallel in Romanesque art for the Turin mosaic is a floor that never existed. A poem written about the year 1100 by Baudri, at that time abbot of Bourgueil, describes in great detail the decor of the chamber of Adele, Countess of Blois (a daughter of William the Conqueror), as imagined by the author. While the ceiling of the apartment was rendered as the sky, with constellations and planets, and the walls were hung with tapestries depicting a wide variety of historical, Biblical, and mytho- logical subjects, the floor was a mappa mundi showing the earth encircled by the ocean. The water was filled with islands and all manner of fish and sea monsters; the earth displayed the three continents, their rivers, seas, mountains, and characteristic animals; and everything was extensively labeled.'87 At the end of his lengthy opus, the author freely admits that he let his imagination carry him away ("Plus quod decuit quam quod erat cecini").'88 But conceptually, at least, the rendering of the floor as an explicit piece of cartography had emerged-or rather, reemerged-here, two or three generations be- fore the Turin mosaic was made.

Possibly this ele- ment of cosmic symbolism was present also in our church at Turin. It is interesting in this connection to note that the orientation of the mosaic map on the chancel floor corresponds with the realities of the building. The northwest sector of the ocean with its islands lies actually to the northwest. The point should not be stressed unduly since most medieval maps show East on top, so that a map placed on the longi- tudinal axis of a normally oriented church will automatically be in a "correct" position. But whether or not the Turin mappa mundi was in- tended to impart a measure of cosmic symbolism to the architectural space in which it was set, its peculiar interest lies not so much in its con- formity with traditional cosmographic pave- ment decoration as in the new departure it entails vis-a'-vis that tradition. For the physical world was introduced here in a spirit and with an accent quite different from that which had characterized the related decorations of the Early Byzantine period. The decisive difference lies in the Wheel of Fortuna which the designer has placed at the center of the earth. In the thought world of the Christian East in the sixth century, earth and ocean, heaven and stars-figuratively or literally represented in the church building-mirrored "the mysteries of the divine Essence." 189 Contemplating God's creation was a means for the faithful to attain to a contemplation of God Himself. By con- trast, our twelfth-century artist has linked his representation of the earth with a moral allegory that spells instability, transitoriness, and vanity; and he has made that link so palpable and in- dissoluble that the earth itself becomes in effect an object of contempt. A moralistic and es- sentially pessimistic view of the sensible world has replaced the "idealistic" interpretation of an earlier age. It is through the intimate fusion of Fortuna's Wheel with the circle of the earth that the lesson is driven home. But the image and its message gain additional force through being placed on a floor. The earth is literally "put in its place" 189 See supra, n. 176.</page><page sequence="30">VOL. 117, NO. 5, 19731 WORLD MAP AND FORTUNE'S WHEEL 373 in the divine scheme of things. He who enters the sanctuary is obliged to step on it as he ap- proaches the altar. It is at the altar alone, and not in the contemplation of the created world, that we reach God. Only at the altar does true and lasting fortune reside. The picture of the earth is meant to be trodden on. There was no danger of desecration here such as St. Bernard had so vigorously decried. On the contrary, this is a representation which gained in effective- ness by being placed underfoot. Rarely had the problem of a meaningful Christian floor decora- tion been solved so neatly. Even the stern abbot of Clairvaux might have approved.</page></plain_text>
