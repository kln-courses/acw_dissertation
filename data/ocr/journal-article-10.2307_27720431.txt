I examine the relationship between aspects of early music scholarship and modernism, with specific reference to Ezra Pound's critical and editorial work on medieval song, and to the composition, in the 1920s, of his modernist opera Le Testament. This analysis places Pound's work as editor and composer not only in the context of recent critical reflections on the idea of authenticity, but also in relation to the histories and methodologies of medieval music interpretation. First, in drawing attention to Pound's much?neglected collaborative edition of medieval songs entitled Hesternae Rosae, I contextualise his experiments in rhythmic reconstruction with reference to early and late twentieth-century musicologists working in this field. I make particular reference to the work of Pierre Aubry and rhythmic mode theory, and the later perspectives of Hendrik van der Werf. Secondly, I proceed to analyse Pound's monophonie and dance song compositions in Le Testament, exploring the way in which serious medieval musicological scholarship prepared for, and is allied to, the development of a rhythmically and dramatically complex musical style. The subject of this article is the conscious imaginative relationship between a little-known work of modernist music theatre and a significant moment in the historical process of interpreting 'authentic' medieval song, a confluence in which an understanding of the past shaped, and was shaped by, an immediate modernist present. One of the great and most controversial medievalists of the twentieth century, the poet and composer Ezra Pound wrote the music and devised the drama for his 'opera' Le Testament in the early 1920s. The opera, created amidst the musical excitement of Paris in that decade, is absolutely recognisable as a work of its own period, a rhythmically complex, non-tonal, non-linear product of the modernist avant-garde; it also importantly grew out of both the serious historical-interpretative study and the creative work on medieval song that had occupied Pound since the early years of the twentieth century. From 1908, throughout the years of Pound's residence in London, he had been a prolific music reviewer, but his relocation to Paris in 1920 was to encourage him to move from criticism to composition. By 1923, with the help of his friend Georges Antheil, he had a complete score for his first opera.1 The opera consists in large part of settings of the medieval French poet Francois Villon, and incorporates a cast of characters who reflect variously on such 1 For Pound's collected music reviews and other music-related writings, see E%ra Pound and Music: The Complete Criticism, ed.

In many other respects, however, it is a distinctly 'unoperatic' work, belonging to those traditions of music theatre that define themselves against a 'high' operatic genre.2 This article examines Pound's early publications on medieval song and explores the ways in which his training in early music interpretation and reconstruction informs his creative musical composition. Firstly, I consider Pound's neglected collaborative edition of medieval songs, entitled Hesternae Rosae? This collection is discussed in the context of other contemporary and later musicologists working in the same areas, and in particular with reference to the rhythmic mode theory popularised by Pierre Aubry, and its opponents. Secondly, I analyse ways in which this early work shapes Pound's musical style as a composer of monophonie and collective dance songs, two forms central to his music-theatrical imagination. His musical idiom is characteristically modernist; at the same time his contemporary setting of Villon's original medieval lyrics in Le Testament demonstrates his particular understanding of medieval song. Throughout, I outline a specific relationship between early and modernist music at crucial points of their development. Much attention has recently been directed not only towards the continuing process of interpreting medieval song music, but also to the histories and methodologies of that process. The concepts of 'authenticity' and 'reproduction', for so long the tantalising holy grails of early music interpretation, have come under a good deal of practical and theoretical scrutiny. Do we have enough evidence to agree on what a medieval song performance might have sounded like? With several hundred years of endeavour in trying, and failing to agree, it is now possible to see some of the ways in which each generation has reinvented medieval music, quite often in its own image. In particular, two recent studies have sought to relativise the idea of an absolute evolution in our knowledge of early music. John Haines has considered the history of troubadour and trouv?re song interpretation through the lens of reception theory. According to Haines: [T]he reception is the music. My reception narrative takes place for the most part in times outside the Middle Ages, where there is more talk of printed notes and piano accompani ments than scribes or harps. But the former have much more to do with our Middle Ages than we often care to admit. Medieval music comes to all of us first as an impression, unacknowledged or not, and that impression is the result of a lengthy reception process.4 Daniel Albright has written persuasively about Pound's Le Testament in the context of such works of music theatre as Brecht/WeilPs The Threepenny Opera, a work which also draws significantly on the poetry of Francois Villon. See Untwisting the Serpent: Modernism in Music, Literature, and Other Arts (Chicago and London, 2000). W. Anthony Sheppard has also analysed the diversity of music-theatrical experimentation amongst modernist practitioners: 'The multitude of works that cannot easily be labeled "opera," "play," or "ballet" indicates the need for a broader and more flexible term ? thus, "music theater" '; Revealing Masks: Exotic Influences and Ritualised Performance in Modernist Music Theater (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2001), 3.

Seeing how one idea led to another, seeing how they interacted with other period concerns, and keeping always in mind what evidence was available at the time, it was impossible to avoid seeing also how much invention was going on and how firmly it was shaped by the preferences and beliefs of scholars.5 For Leech-Wilkinson this suggests a necessary re-evaluation of priorities, whereby historical musicology takes an equal and non-hierarchical place next to other modes of understanding and interpretation. If 'invention' has always been a sometimes unconscious and unwitting part of the search after an authentic truth, it is also very close to the more consciously imaginative process of new musical composition; composition informed by an understanding of the past but at the same time firmly located in its own 'period concern' and style. As a creative artist, Pound intuitively realised that there were many possibilities in medieval musicology, many ways in which its currency could be urgently expressed, fulfilling back in the 1920s at least part of Leech-Wilkinson's potentially radical idea that he directs towards the current generation of musicologists and performers: 'Work on medieval music can be done from an infinite range of viewpoints and with a great many worthwhile aims'.6 Pound has often been characterised, not least by his own propaganda, as an artist revolutionary, breaking with early twentieth-century traditions to forge a new artistic style in the context of an increasingly modernistic and fractured culture. Such a characterisation at the very least has to co-exist with the recognition that Pound was immersed in the artistic and historical traditions of Europe, America and Asia. I will argue that in his musical composition, the revolutionary and the traditional are not two separate aspects of his work, but that they are mutually dependent. In particular, as a contemporary composer of song and of opera, Pound turned to the European tradition of the troubadours, the trouv?res, and their successors: 'The particular problem, mot% el son, did occupy the best auditors in South Europe for at least a couple of centuries (troubadours and all that, Arnaut Daniel, Sordello to Dante) and to that epoch . . . one must still go for the ABC of the subject'.7 Interpreting the troubadour tradition: Pound's medieval apprenticeship In The Spirit of Romance (London, 1910), an early work on medieval literature and culture, Pound focused on medieval song in the chapters 'II Miglior Fabbro' (on the Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, The Modern Invention of Medieval Music (Cambridge, 2002), 6. 6 Leech-Wilkinson, 8. 7 Ezra Pound, Guide to Kulchur (London, 1966; f.p. 1938), 366.</page><page sequence="4">56 Charles Mundye work of Arnaut Daniel), 'Proenca' and 'Psychology and the Troubadours'. This book, part anthology, part critical study, explores the content of the songs in the context of the lives and culture of the troubadours, characterising the 'chivalric code' as a manifestation of a mystical cult. In the following years he extended these considerations to engage with the music of the songs, concerning himself with the interpretation of the medieval musical notation, its modernisation and its perform ance.8 The most tangible products of this developing interest were two music collections: the first, Hesternae Rosae, was a collaboration with the concert pianist Walter Morse Rummel; the second, Five Troubadour Songs, was produced with Agnes Bedford, and published in 1920.9 Hesternae Rosae incorporates musical settings of the original proven?al with alternative modern French and English translations (the English text adaptation is by Pound himself), and for Five Troubadour Songs Pound supplemented the settings of the original songs with alternative texts from Chaucer's poetry.10 These collections were conceived as parlour music, written for solo voice and piano accompaniment, which inevitably imposed several limiting compromises.11 The preface to Hesternae Rosae, whose very title ('the roses of yesterday') appealed to a market hungry for quaint medievalisms, consequently includes a guarded justification and disclaimer: 'To reflect some of the charm and atmosphere of these various works and melodies; to bring them before the public of to-day in as living and vital a form as possible ? the form best adapted to our modern times ? is the writer's only wish and intention'.12 This was an exercise in modernisation and popularisation; a translation or mediation of the 'original' songs into an accessible and easily readable form.13 The preface to Hesternae Rosae informs its audience that the medieval manuscripts of the songs, whilst indicating melodic pitch, give little or no clue as to the rhythm of the melody. For a modern collection of this kind, some kind of rhythmic imposition becomes necessary: The musical notation of all of these melodies is Neumatic (by nods or signs), and bears no trace of rhythmic indications, save for occasional vertical lines which are supposed to have 8 William D. Paden Jr. outlines Pound's philological interest in troubadour manuscripts: 'Romance philology was the one discipline other than poetry itself in which Ezra Pound could claim a nearly complete professional training . . . The most recondite form of his activity in this domain, the form most revealing of his technical expertise and his attitude toward the philological techn?, lay in his consultation of troubadour manuscripts.' 'Pound's Use of Troubadour Manuscripts', Comparative Literature, 32 (1980), 402?12: 402. Rummel, Hesternae Rosae, and Agnes Bedford, Five Troubadour Songs (London, 1920). John Haines mentions Pound's and Rummel's activity in Chapter 5 of Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouv?res, referring to Pound as 'the early troubadour advocate' (206). Pound justifies this choice in his introduction to Five Troubadour Songs: 'Chaucer, far less agile a metrist than the troubadours, offers perhaps the closest kinship with the originals' ., [ii] Augener Ltd published Hesternae Rosae, and Boosey and Co. Five Troubadour Songs. Rummel, Hesternae Rosae, [iii]. The manuscripts from which Rummel and Pound were working (see Paden, 'Pound's Use of Troubadour Manuscripts' for details) are themselves later written records of an earlier, oral, song tradition.</page><page sequence="5">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 57 CHANT.

The rhythmic re-constitution of such melodies is therefore, for lack of more positive records, a somewhat hypothetical task. A translation of the metre of the words into the rhythm of music or the correct adherence of the tonal to dynamic accents, seems the most plausible and admitted method of realising the rhythmic structure of this music, as by this process the notes very readily fall into the swing given to them by the metre of the words.14 This passage makes it clear that the imposed musical rhythms are determined, not by the particularities of a given textual rhythm, but by 'a translation of the metre of the words into the rhythm of music' (my italics). This is in evidence in Example 1 from the first song in the collection, Arnaut Daniel's 'Chansson Doil Mot'.15 The melodic line is constructed from a series of small rhythmic units (strong minim followed by weak crotchet), with a degree of variation created by the occasional inclusion of different note clusters, which nevertheless are equivalent to 14 Rummel, Hesternae Rosae, [iii]. The preface to Hesternae Rosae states that Pound himself rediscovered the music to this song, and to the second Daniel song in this collection, 'Lo Ferm Voler': 'The two Daniel melodies are here published for the first time to the writer's [Rummel's] knowledge, and he is indebted to Mr. Ezra Pound, M.A., for communicating them from the Milan Library' [iii]. However, Sch?fer points out that these melodies had been published before in 1896 (see E%ra Pound and Music, 27?8n).</page><page sequence="6">58 Charles Mundye the minim/crotchet shape of the basic pattern. Following the anacrustic crotchet setting 'Chans?', the basic metrical pattern is established for '?son doil', and this minim/crotchet pattern is repeated with variation for 'mot son', reverts to its basic manifestation for 'plan et', before the extended durational accent on the last and rhyming syllable of the line: 'prim'. This rhythmic pattern is then repeated, with a smaller middle variation, in the next line of text, and the rest of the song follows the pattern of these first two lines. The transcription ensures a correspondence between melody and text, but its insistent and repeated r?gularisation disallows the possibility of this correspondence developing any significant complexity or subtlety. Such a melodic setting is the musical equivalent of reading out a poetic text according to its metrical pattern and ignoring the particular rhythmic movement of the words themselves. Pound discussed the problem in a different context in an article for The New Age in 1912: 'Yet it is quite certain that some people can hear and scan "by quantity", and more can do so "by stress", and fewer still feel rhythm by what I would call the inner form of the line. And it is this "inner form", I think, which must be preserved in music.'16 The point is made from a different compositional perspective in F. S. Flint's Imagist statement from Poetry, March 1913: 'As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome'.17 The transcriptions of the troubadour melodies throughout Hesternae Rosae respond mainly to the metrical scansion, and not to the 'inner form' of the lines of text. They are ultimately too 'metronomic', and do not trust the 'musical phrase' of the text itself. Looking back on his experience, Pound was to write: I strongly suspect that Rummel and I in 1910, following other students who were supposed then to know more than we did, failed to recognize what might have been supposed to be a ms. indication. I suggest that the next digger try to interpret troubadour tune on the hypothesis that the line (of verse) is the bar and can be graphed to best advantage as a (that is one single) bar.18 'The bondage of melody': modal rhythms and monophonie song The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries were active periods in the interpretation of medieval manuscript melodies. The scholars Pierre Aubry and Jean Beck in particular were producing several volumes of medieval song editions, and related academic studies, and Pound certainly knew of their work.19 The rhythmic orthodoxy of Aubry and Beck centres on the hypothesis that monophonie medieval song is constructed around modal rhythms, an idea that is Quoted in Schafer, E%ra Pound and Music, 32. Quoted in Imagist Poetry, ed. Peter Jones (London, 1972), 129. 18 Pound, Guide to Kulchur, 199. In an article from the Quarterly Review, 1913: 'Troubadours ? Their Sorts and Conditions', Pound writes of troubadour song: 'Or he may try listening to the words with the music, for, thanks to Jean Beck and others [Pound provides a footnote here: 'Walter Morse RummePs Neuf Chansons de Troubadours, pub. Augener, Ltd., etc; also the settings by Aubry.'] it is now possible to hear the old tunes.' Reprinted in Literary Essays of E%ra Pound, ?d. T. S. Eliot (London, 1954), 95.</page><page sequence="7">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 59 presented succinctly in Aubry's study Trouv?res et Troubadours, first published in 1909 (the year before Pound published The Spirit of Romance, and was working on Hesternae Rosae with Rummel).20 This book provides a general but technically quite detailed introduction to both the text and music of the songs. The basic interpretative position is outlined early on. Aubry states: 'We shall treat later, in discussing medieval prosody, of the bondage of melody, and the strict rules which enslaved it to verse . . . The lyrical work of the middle ages must be judged as a combination of two arts, music and poetry, ceaselessly reacting upon one another.'21 The metaphoric description of the relationship between words and music in the terms of enslavement seems to contradict the sense of a 'combination' of arts, a contradiction that is the inevitable result of the rhythmic system which Aubry, and several of his contemporaries, believed governed the medieval songs.22 He describes this system at greater length in the section entitled 'The Mensural Theory of Music in the Thirteenth Century', arguing that the six basic rhythmic modes used to determine the rhythms of medieval polyphony should also be applied to reconstruct the rhythmic shape of monophonie song.23 These rhythmic modes constitute carefully defined and controlled sequences of regular rhythmic pulses, and each one, Aubry suggests, is more or less suited to different poetic forms. The absence of any obvious rhythmic indication in the medieval song manuscript is therefore explained, because each poetic form would imply a fixed and universally acknowledged rhythmic mode which would be automatically recognised and applied by any performer. However, such a systematic framework presents certain limitations: This limited choice of rhythmical formulae must have caused intolerable sameness, especially since no change of'mode' was allowed from one end to the other. Means of relief 20 All quotations are from, and references are to, the English translation of this book: Pierre Aubry, Trouv?res and Troubadours, trans. Claude Aveling (New York, 1914; rpt. New York, 1969). 21 Aubry, 9-10. 22 Aubry briefly acknowledges his debt for the basic interpretative ideas that inform his work: 'The notation is familiar to us from manuscripts quoted in the course of this work, but its significance was mysterious and puzzling until M. Beck solved the problem with his "modal interpretation", a solution accepted by the present author' (162). John Haines {Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouv?res, 218) has explored the argument between Beck and Aubry about who first 'discovered' the modal theory, an argument that led to accusations of plagiarism against Aubry, and to a civil tribunal in which Aubry was found guilty: 'Aubry gave up hope of ever recovering his scholarly dignity. He apparently contrived his own death, fencing unprotected in a routine practice that same month. The shocking outcome did no good for Beck, who, it was rumoured, was somehow linked to Aubry's death; some even said Aubry was preparing to duel with him, but this was only a fiction started to save both Aubry and Beck's honour.' The ferocity and length of debate surrounding the 'rhythm question' provided Haines with the initial impetus for his book: 'Why was rhythm considered so important in medieval song? ... I realized a proper answer would require a historiography which included writers and readers, players and listeners outside official historical turf. That is basically how this book came into being, as a rather long answer to a simple question' (1). 23 For a description of the rhythmic modes in the context of medieval polyphony, see for example Richard H. Hoppin, Medieval Music (New York and London, 1978), 221?31.</page><page sequence="8">60 Charles Mundye from this monotony were found to a certain extent; the use of equivalents helped to vary the interminable procession of shorts and longs.24 Whilst Aubry's theories allow that there is a close relationship between textual and musical form in the medieval songs, he circumscribes the possibilities of that relationship through his postulation of fixed and defined musical rhythmic modes, despite his rather tentative admission of the possibilities of variation through the use of 'equivalent' note clusters (for instance, the use of three crotchets for a dotted minim). The relationship between text and melody that emerges from this theoretical position will almost inevitably be restrictive. The resulting artistic problems are hinted at in the early part of Aubry's book, but are there implied merely in the particular metaphorical description of 'the bondage of melody, and the strict rules that enslaved it to verse' (my italics). In his conclusion, however, Aubry makes these reservations explicit: Though there is a certain nobility in the troubadour melodies, worthy of imitation, the rhythmical scheme is less satisfactory ... I would almost venture on the formula - no better and no worse than all formulae which claim to summarise an aesthetic judgement ? that a troubadour or trouv?re melody is of equal musical value with an air out of an old-fashioned comedy-opera sung without an accompaniment.25 This disparaging evaluation is arguably ascribable to Aubry's strict interpretation of the rhythmic mode theory. He denies melody freedom in its rhythmic constitution; the monodic line can mostly achieve its complexity from the degree to which its rhythm is complex and subtle, and Aubry's interpretation militates against this possibility. In transcribing the melody of 'Chansson doil mot' from manuscript, Pound and Rummel used the first rhythmic mode described by Aubry: 'The first "mode" (the classical trochee adapted to medieval music) is made up of two elements, a long of two beats, and a short of one'.26 Pound/Rummel's melody follows this trochaic pattern in anacrusis, with an imposed regularity described by Aubry's modal paradigm. One of the ways in which the rhythmic mode theory denies complexity is through its insistence, not only on fixed and regular musical measures, but also on the exact repetition of these units throughout the setting of a given poetic text. As the rhythmic modes are constructed around small-scale metrical patterns in the verse (for instance, the trochee, the iambus, the dactyl), so the basic mode is inevitably to be repeated (admittedly with the variation of 'equivalent' notes) several times in the setting of one line of verse, hence the degree of monotony that such a system can create. This over-regimented rhythmical design therefore not only militates against a detailed response to the subtleties of the small-scale rhythms of a verse line, but also to the larger shape of the line itself, and to the relationship of this line to the rest of the song. Although the rhythmic mode follows the basic metrical 24 Aubry, 157. 25 Aubry, 169. 26 Aubry, 154.</page><page sequence="9">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 61 shape of the verse, it constrains an accurate response to the actual rhythms present in any given line. Pound's suggestion in Guide to Kulchur that future scholars might interpret the melody by regarding the line of verse as the musical bar addresses this degree of over-determined rhythmic regulation: that is, the structure of the melody should respond not merely to the metre of the verse, but should also take into account the particularities of poetic rhythm in each given line of text. The modal rhythmic theory requires a restrictive interdependence between music and text; Pound's suggestion for future scholars here also recognises a relationship between the two, and indeed one in which the poetic text has a degree of priority, but by making the 'line' determine the 'bar' there is the possibility of extensive durational and accentual flexibility, of an almost infinite melodic variation. Melody set free? Whilst the rhythmic mode theory still has its adherents, there has been a steady and persuasive reaction against its likely historical validity (if such a thing can ever be established), and certainly against its aesthetic viability or desirability. Perhaps the scholar who has most championed an alternative way of thinking is Hendrik van der Werf, notably in his groundbreaking 1972 study The Chansons of the Troubadours and Trouv?res, and in his subsequent editorial work. In his 'Musical Introduction' to The Ijyrics and Melodies of Adam de la Halle, he writes: [I]n general, modal rhythm did not occur in trouv?re chansons. Even stronger, the difference in the notation [between Adam's motets and chansons] strengthens the conclusion, drawn from other features, that in the chansons the duration of notes and syllables could not be expressed in the mensural notation of the Middle Ages nor in the normal notation of our time. For this edition, therefore, the melodies are transcribed in a somewhat modernized version of the medieval non-mensural notation.27 To paraphrase, Adam de la Halle composed motets which are notated in medieval manuscript in modal rhythms. The absence of these modal rhythms from Adam's chansons manuscripts (and at least one of these manuscripts is written by the same scribe who notated the motets with modal rhythms) indicates to van der Werf that the chansons require a different and more flexible rhythmic interpretation. The practical implications of this hypothesis can be demonstrated through a comparison of two versions of Adam's song 'Li maus d'amors': Example 2(a), from Oeuvres Compl?tes du Trouv?re Adam de la Halle, edited by E. de Coussemaker (1872), and Example 2(b) from The Lyrics and Melodies of Adam de la Halle (1985).28 27 The Lyrics and Melodies of Adam de la Halle, ed.

See also Hendrik van der Werf, The Chansons of the Troubadours and Trouv?res (Utrecht, 1972). As a result of manuscript variants, Coussemaker's and Nelson's text for this song have several differences. Coussemaker has the opening words as 'Li maus d'amer', and Nelson has 'Li maus d'amors'. When referring generally to this song, Nelson's 'Li maus d'amors' will be used.</page><page sequence="10">62 Charles Mundye Traduction en notation moderne. ^=??. t* M r r i J%jg Li maus d'?- - mer me plaist miex ? sen M SE -**-+ *-+ * I * 2 ,r~ i r ? &amp; ? tir K'a maint a- mant ne fait li dons de ^P T*" Bt -?* Ijgjfe ^ )oi - e, Car mes es- - poirs vaut d'au- trui le ^T c?=? ?* ^^ W=&amp; BE ?^* ? *-? * ?Lf ????.r it* rFpf jo - - ?r Si bien me plaint quan-ques a - mours 2= m tn - voi - e Ex. 2a: Oeuvres Compl?tes du Trouv?re Adam de la Halle, ?d.

However, a modernisation of the melody, under the headnote 'Traduction en Notation Moderne', follows in each case.</page><page sequence="11">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 63 Van de Werf's version places the melody on a modern five-line treble staff, but with no imposition of a hypothesised rhythmic pattern. He concurs with Pound's conclusions on the treatment of the line as musical bar, as the layout on the page makes clear; each line of text is given a separate staff. This separation equates to Pound's suggestion in Guide to Kulchur in that it implies that each line of verse guides the shape of the musical units of the song (which is not to suggest that there has to be a pause or other musical separation at the end of each line; the line guides rhythm and phrasing, but that line in turn is part of the larger architecture of the song as a whole). The relevant textual syllable of the first stanza of each song is written under each note or cluster of notes, and it is from the rhythmic nature of the text that the performer must glean the melodic-rhythmic shape. The performer's judgement in terms of musical rhythm is variously shaped by the textual rhythmic pattern, the syntax, the meaning of the words and the overall emotional mood of the song. This transcription allows an exploration of the complexities of rhythmic and semantic combinations, and the open notation encourages these complexities to be fully realised by the performer. Musical considerations are free to work in conjunction with the subtleties of the poetry; they are not hindered by an extraneous rationalisation.29 The importance of this rhythmic interpretative freedom is most obviously demonstrated through a consideration of the way in which the setting of a song proceeds through its various stanzas. Troubadour and trouv?re songs are s trophic; one melody serves several stanzas of text. Hence both editions of Adam de la Halle's 'Li maus d'amors' discussed here provide only a melodic setting for the first stanza on the understanding that this melody will be used for all subsequent stanzas. The song provides a typical exposition of the various emotional states provoked by an unrequited love, and the opening melodic phrase in Coussemaker's version (Ex. 2(a)) presents an apposite accompaniment to the first stanza. This first line establishes the usual oxymoronic condition of pleasure found in suffering: 'Li maus d'amer me piaist miex ? sentir' ('It pleases me more to feel the suffering of love'). The particular shape of the melodic line here stresses 'd'amer'; the two full musical bars devoted to 'love' emphasise very clearly its centrality, not only in this opening 29 In one of the most important recent books engaging with the art of the troubadours, Elizabeth Aubrey summarises the history and variety of rhythmic interpretation in this field before suggesting that responsibility in this area might well rest firmly with a performer's preferences within a potential variety of performance styles: 'Given the complexity of the elements that make up a troubadour song, a singer's approach to performance might fluctuate from day to day, sometimes centred on the compelling features of versification, sometimes on the theme or the mood of the text, sometimes on the motivic relationships in the music, the tonal goals, or other musical features. A performance might be more measured one day, more declamatory the next, more variegated in rhythmic shape the next. If it is true that the songs lived for a specific hearing, then a singer might gauge the audience, the room, and the occasion, and adjust the approach accordingly.' Aubrey, The Music of the Troubadours (Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1996), 244. Such an inclusive approach places a significant responsibility on the performer. Whilst van der Werf's 'declamatory' style is here allowed as only one possibility amongst many, his uncluttered transcription of the melodies would be a necessary starting point for any performer interested in practising such interpretative pluralism.</page><page sequence="12">64 Charles Mundye ??p &gt;~7j | J. 1 J p~p 11? p 1 J jjj| J??J?

This is melodically balanced by the setting of the verb 'sentir' ('to feel') at the end of this first line, which receives a similar rhythmic representation to 'amer' (note the repeat of the triplet), with almost the same durational emphasis placed upon it. The similarity of musical emphasis on the words 'amer' and 'sentir' underlines the half-rhyme of the two words, and further responds to their significant durational weighting in the line of verse. The two central motivating concepts of the song, established in the opening verse line, are musically accentuated by this opening melodic phrase; 'love', and the emotional 'feelings' of the poet to 'love', are underlined by the rhythmic organisation. To this extent there is an obvious confluence between the shape of Coussemaker's melodic transcrip tion, and the rhythmic, and conceptual, shape and content of the first line of text. The strophic nature of the song, however, requires that this exact melodic line is used to set the first lines of all the subsequent stanzas. The opening phrase of the next stanza is, in Coussemaker's plan, identical to the first in musical structure, but not, of course, in textual content and textual rhythmic emphasis (see Ex. 3). Instead of working with the text, the melodic organisation creates a strong emphasis on the adjective 'douch', disrupting the grammatical flow of the line (a long pause is created between adjective and verb), and it further stresses a relatively unimportant conceptual element of the text. The structure of the melody here contains a directional caesura which works effectively with the first line of the opening stanza, but which in the first line of the second stanza creates a disruption to the conceptual, grammatical and rhythmic flow. Such problems are multiplied throughout the rest of the melody and its application to the successive stanzas. Each stanza is governed by particular emotional moods; desire and courage (stanza 2), pity and humility (stanza 3), sorrow (stanza 4) and so on. In order to express this range of emotional states and their particular verbal manifestation in this song, a performer needs access not only to a variable expressive dynamic range, but also to a range of musical rhythmic subtleties to do justice to the conceptual and rhythmic variety of the text. As van der Werf comments on the strophic nature of Adam's songs, and their satisfactory performance: In the process of developing a rendition aimed at getting the text across to an audience, one is likely to develop many subtle fluctuations in duration and emphasis. Since the meaning and the flow of the text varies from one line to another as well as from one strophe to another, such fluctuations are likely to vary accordingly.30 Nelson and van der Werf, eds., Adam de la Halle, xxxiii.

Subtle changes in the rhythmic disposition of the line, allied to variations in expressive dynamics, can, in this manner of transcription, work towards supporting and developing all of the various emotional mood changes of the song. This is not to deny the value of many strophic songs which do successfully use the same melody to render various textual stanzas; one thinks of the strophic lyrics of Dowland and Campion, which often use the restriction of the strophic setting to creative advantage. But the demonstrable inappropriateness of using exactly the same melodic formulation for all stanzas in such a song as 'Li maus d'amors' perhaps suggests that these medieval French songs are best represented without a fixed and rhythmically determined musical pattern through which all of their text is processed. Pound's Le Testament and monophonie rhythm Following his collaborative work on Five Troubadour Songs in 1920, Pound was to have little further direct involvement in the interpretation and transcription of medieval song melody. The lessons he learned, however, are in direct evidence in the way he approached his own melodic composition when setting the texts of the later medieval poet Francois Villon for his opera.31 His compositional technique in the songs of Le Testament grows out of, and is consistent with, his mature understanding of troubadour and trouv?re melodic interpretation. In a review of the 1992 York Festival performance of Pound's Le Testament, Wilfrid Meilers com mented that 'the relation between voices and instruments anticipated the sounds we now hear in "authentic" performances of medieval music; Pound's amateurism is today's professionalism, which says something for artistic instinct.'32 That Pound was able to re-create before its time an 'authentic' medieval soundscape is remarkable enough; that this soundscape is part of, and confluent with, a work that is characteristically modernist, says something further about the complex relation ship between modernism and the early music 'revival'. However, as I have demonstrated so far, the re-creation of this medieval sound was not the result of artistic instinct alone; by the early 1920s Pound was as immersed in the very serious theoretical debates and practice surrounding early music interpretation as any composer or poet then practising. The opera's modernist characteristics are variously manifested. The dramatic structure works through the elliptical juxtaposition of thematic relations: a collage quality of the interpreter, to improvisation . . .' [iv]. However, as previously demonstrated, the particular method of transcription in their collection militated against the full implications of this statement being realised in any performance of the songs. 31 Pound chose to set the poetry of Villon, for which no musical accompaniment contemporaneous with the poetry survives, and which, though historically later, he believed shared lyrical characteristics with troubadour and trouv?re poetry. He was to make this connection clear in 1934: 'Villon and Chaucer in France and England, had their root in Provence: their art, their artistry, and a good deal of their thought'. (Ezra Pound, Z?BC of Reading [London, 1951; f.p. 1934], 56.) 32 Wilfrid Meilers, 'Music ab ovo\ TLS, 3 July 1992, 22.</page><page sequence="14">66 Charles Mundye of lengthy excerpts from the text of Fran?ois Villon's 'Le Testament', set to Pound's original musical composition, is interpolated with the words and music of two original medieval songs, albeit newly orchestrated. The interaction of characters in the musical episodes is almost non-existent; the drama is stylised and non naturalistic; its scenic episodes centre on the characters performing in a space variously figured as a tavern, a church, a brothel and a gallows. When adapting the opera for a groundbreaking radio performance broadcast by the BBC in 1931, Pound fleshed out its drama with connecting dialogue, in part as compensation for the lack of a visual staging.33 But even in this 'popularised' version the opera is characteristically dissonant and fragmented, yoking together extremes of expressive language across linguistic and chronological boundaries, forcing a consideration of relation in difference, upsetting any generic sense of continuity and stability. In this version the cast of characters moves between singing in medieval French and a spoken dialogue that itself shifts in tone and style between 'American gangster' and Cockney vernacular, incorporating dislocating movements from song to speech: 'Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan? ... I dunno, I dunno where yer snows are gone, I dunno'.34 This dramatic eclecticism is matched in the instrumental range and combination of its orchestra. Robert Hughes has highlighted its coincidental similarity to another modernist orchestrational technique: But the dominant instrumental concept of the opera is a klangfarbenmelodie technique similar in concept to Webern's, the line being fragmented among a group of instruments which, played by 17 performers, consists of nose-flute, flute and piccolo (one player), oboe, saxophone, bassoon, trumpet (for two bars only!), horn, two trombones, mandolin, violin, cello, three contrabassi, a variety of drums (including six tympani), bells, "brass bells" (six) . . . gongs, sandpaper, dried bones and a percussionist whistling.35 Much of the opera's pointillist orchestration precludes any sense of traditional harmonic practice, however attenuated. The instrumentation itself is often sparse, percussion instruments predominate, while others (most insistently, violin, cello, oboe) play only limited roles, often supporting the vocal line in unison, although this is not sustained by one instrument throughout. When the strings vary from this echo of the vocal line, they sometimes produce sustained passages centred on one pitch. These pedal points tend to reinforce rhythmic patterns, and only as a secondary consideration do they colour the changing parts around them; but they do often punctuate vocal rhythms, and establish their own counter-rhythmic effects. However, there are periods of distinct contrast: one song is accompanied solely by tubular chimes; another by four contrabassi, cello, bells and piano playing low in their registers; and another only by solo violin. The last song, 'Fr?res humains', is For a detailed account of the genesis of this production, broadcast on the 26 and 27 October 1931, and of its significance to the technical and aesthetic development of the nascent art of radio drama, see Margaret Fisher, E%ra Pound's Radio Operas: The BBC Experiments, 1931?1933 (Cambridge, MA, 2002).

The opera's most immediately apparent modernist characteristic is its frequently complex melodic line, a complexity that is derived from the response of musical to textual rhythm. This disruption of traditional musical expectations is a result of Pound's detailed rhythmic negotiations of poetic text, exactly the area of song technique informed by his work on medieval song interpretation. Throughout Le Testament Pound rejected the option of strophic setting; the songs are through-composed, so that each stanza receives its own particular melodic representation. This is not to suggest that the melodic Une is completely different for each stanza of text; the melody is often reconstituted from its own previous material, allowing small-scale repetition which both responds to structural and ideational repetition in the text, and creates melodic coherence.36 This melodic technique is demonstrated particularly well in the thirteenth song o? Le Testament, 'Je renye Amours', a song with a single vocal melodic line accompanied only by a solo violin. It is sung by the Gallant, a dissipated and treacherous friend of Villon. Gallant enters the stage, accompanied by Rose, Villon's (also treacherous) lover. He sings of renunciation and retreat: love, he declares, has 'killed' him, developing the already established pun on la petite mort introduced in one of his earlier songs. In this respect it is a late addition to the genre of love song which both Arnaut Daniel's 'Chansson doil mot' and Adam de le Halle's 'Li maus d'amors' unproblematically exemplify; Villon's text plays with traditional generic expectations, replacing the oxymoron of pleasure in pain with an acerbic analysis of the way love has brought him to the point of death. The song presents a self-reflexive paradox on the nature of love and art. First, death, occasioned by love, has brought him to the end of his art: 'Ma vielle ay mys soubz le banc' (Tve put my fiddle under the seat'; that is, my days of loving and of music and song are over). And yet his arrival at the point of death also liberates him to challenge the generic expectations of love, and to do so through song: 'Et, s'aucun m'interroge ou tente / Comment d'amours ose mesdire, / Ceste parolle les contente: / "Qui meurt a ses loix de tout dire" ' ('If anyone asks me how I can say this about love, these words will have to do "Who dies, must have his say" '). There are several repeated rhythmic motifs in the melody of 'Je renye Amours', which lend shape to the melodic progression, and further provide a response to the large-scale structural similarities of the two stanzas. The first Une of the first stanza, shown in Example 4(a), begins by a large descent, unusual in the melodies of Le 36 The score of 1^ Testament has its own complex developmental history. My observations are based on Robert Hughes' unpublished performance edition of the opera, which has been used for several of its most important performances and recordings (including the Western Opera Theater, 1971; Holland Poetry Festival, 1980; Cambridge Festival, 1985; York Festival, 1992). Hughes' edition is based closely on the Pound/Antheil score of 1923. Despite their various differences, the underlying method of composition informs all of the different score versions, and it is for the sake of concision that I concentrate on this particular manifestation. See Brad Bucknell, Literary Modernism and Musical Aesthetics (Cambridge, 2001), especially 80?5, for a recent reflection on the different versions of the score.</page><page sequence="16">68 Charles Mundye I3~ T?

Testament, of an octave over four notes. This descent is a form of madrigalism, musically echoing the sexual detumescence of the Gallant, and his further, and related, 'fall' towards death. The word 'amours' is articulated by the last (extended) note of the first bar, and also by the opening minim of the second bar, a durational emphasis that responds both to the long syllable, '. . .mours', and further to the central conceptual importance of the word (this melodic emphasis on 'love' ? here as a subject for renunciation ? provides interesting comparison with Coussemaker's opening melodic line to Adam de la Halle's 'Li maus d'amer'). The first five notes/syllables of this opening line form a small melodic phrase. This phrase renders a syntactical unit of subject, verb and object, and the integrity of the phrase is underlined by the durational caesura in the first line created by the central pause on the second syllable of 'Amours', which musically divides the line of verse. The last three syllables of the verse, 'et despite', thus form a new phrase, which is emphasised both by the smaller intervals (consecutive seconds) of the pitch sequence, and by the extended melisma on 'des?' of 'despite'. The melody of this first verse line mixes symmetry and asymmetry. Its subordinate division into five and three-syllable sections is tempered by the exactly equal amount of musical time devoted to these musical sections, a time equivalent to twenty-six semiquavers each (although a shift in rhythmic emphasis is indicated by the change in time signature from 9/8 to 4/4). The first line of the second stanza, Example 4(b), reiterates and varies this melodic material. The line begins on the same note, and the general pattern of descent is followed, but also varied. The four notes fall by a ninth, and are in 4/4 time, which results in the dotted crotchet of the fourth note of the first line being replaced by a crotchet - the opening bar phrase of the second stanza falls slightly further in pitch in a shorter time than the opening bar of the first. The opening line of the second stanza is also divided into two subordinate phrases, this time of six</page><page sequence="17">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 69 and two syllables. The caesura occurs in the second bar of the Une on the quaver rest after 'plumail'. The division in the first line of the first stanza was achieved by the durationally emphatic minim on the second syllable of 'amours'. In the first Une of the second stanza the musical rest provides a more fitting division, as the short syllables of 'plumail' would be misrepresented by the long notes of the equivalent melody from the first stanza. The following phrase setting the two syUables 'au vent' receives a shorter meUsma than the equivalent phrase in the first stanza, but the melisma picks up on the ascending motif of the first line; this marks another reiteration, with further differences. As 'Je renye Amours' progresses, the cumulative variations and small-scale textual responses create more differences in the direction of the melodic line for each stanza, but this divergence is continually balanced by the repetition of melodic material. Although 'Je renye Amours' is through-composed, the music has to respond to large- and smaU-scale similarities between the two stanzas, and therefore proceeds both by reiteration and variation. Pound enables the melodic response to text to vary both in terms of rhythm and pitch, and yet this variation is continually balanced by repeated motifs throughout the songs. The defining characteristic of Pound's technique in this respect is the flexibiUty of the melodic Une in adapting and responding to the specifics of the text. The Une is not determined by overt regularity but by a subtle response to particular textual rhythms and shades of meaning, whilst it is also informed by the more general shape of the song.37 In Villon's poem 'Le Testament', the words of 'Je renye Amours' are his, not the Gallant's, and they have a poignant relevance to his potential danger from capture and execution. This is one of the few places where Pound alters the dramatic setting of a section of poetic text: the sincerity of the passage when related by Villon's persona is somewhat ironised by the context of GaUant's behaviour. His description of death is mediated through a series of sexual figurations, and the final expression of his despondency with love, and desire for death, is carried by an ironic musical phrase at the close of the song (Ex. 5). His 'dying' is an expression o? postcoitum triste as much as it is a realisation of his own mortaUty. It finds musical mimicry in the cadence, marked morendo, an extended madrigaUsm which is overturned immedi ately by the frenetic movement of the next song in the sequence of the opera, the dance song 'P?re No?'. GaUant's stage movements culminate in a final, drunken, collapse at the close of the song, and subsequently his lone voice is subsumed in the social collectivity of the dance. The force of movement: interpreting the chanson ? danser 'P?re No?' requires a large group of singers and instruments for the first time in the opera; their various melodic Unes intersect occasionaUy to produce complicated 37 In this respect Pound's setting of 'Je renye Amours' shares some common ground with van der Werf's later version of the Adam de la Halle song. Both differ from strictly strophic songs in their continual rhythmic adaptability, although van der Werf's open notation requires the performer to take responsibility for this, whereas Pound's responsive melody is shaped by the composer and annotated in the score.</page><page sequence="18">70 Charles Mundye Ex. 5: Le Testament, ?Je renye Amours', final bars. chords, creating a musical diversity that embodies the crowd scene. This group song is both a celebration and lament for Villon's friend John Cotart; it is also a drinking song, and the occasion for the largest musical ensemble in the opera, mourning and celebrating simultaneously.38 In providing an informed modernist pastiche of the medieval dance song towards the end of his opera, Pound's efforts were once again informed by his experience of working with original medieval materials. As most commentators acknowledge, the original medieval dance songs of the troubadours and trouv?res require a different order of consideration and interpreta tion from the courtly songs. John Stevens is characteristic in his differentiation: The relationship [between words and music] is different from that we have seen in la grande chanson courtoise and shall see in narrative poetry, in Gregorian chant and elsewhere. It is a physical thing, basic and close to ordinary human experience. Granted the tightness of my initial assumption, that 'all choral dance-songs, all dances sung and performed in company, must have a metrical base' ? a strictly measured regular rhythm ? words as well as music are likely to contribute to this effect.39 Pound's 'P?re No?' in Le Testament shows a clear understanding of this generic difference, an understanding that is predicated not merely on guesswork or 'instinct'. Pound learned about monolinear rhythms in collaborating with Rummel, but he also engaged with the problems of interpreting and transcribing dance song. The ninth and last song of Hesternae Rosae ? 'A L'Entrade', otherwise referred to by Pound in The Spirit of Romance as 'La Regine Avrillouse'? is representative of precisely this experience. In 1910 Pound included the first stanza and refrain of this chanson ? danser in The Spirit of Romance, remarking of it: 'The "April like Queen", or songs of like character, may have been used in connection with such fragments of the worship of Flora and Venus as survived in the spring merrymakings: the dance itself Throughout the song Cotart's name is occasionally changed to 'Jean Cocteau', who was present at the 1926 premi?re of the opera at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. John Stevens, Words and Music in the Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1986), 196.</page><page sequence="19">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 71 is clearly discernible in its verbal rhythm'.40 For Pound it is clearly important that the dance movement, itself in a complex symbiosis with the musical reaUsation, should grow out of the specific nature of the song's 'verbal rhythm'; it is equaUy clear that he sees the song as having a practical and social purpose, and one Unked to the rituals of ferti?ty and renewal.41 The collective mode of dance provides intersecting patterns of rhythmic sound and movement, and as Stevens intimates, a certain degree of rhythmic r?gularisation is required to coordinate the local divergences and reconciUations of the lyrical and somatic media. That this particular song discip?ne was Ukely to be a central preoccupation for Pound is evident in one of his much-quoted observations: 'Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance . . . poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music'.42 In The Spirit of Romance Pound incorporates only the text of 'A L'Entrade', and it is in the rhythm of the words that he locates 'the dance itself. The verbal rhythms provide a useful analytical starting point; although these rhythms represent only one of the many interacting systems of the artistic event, they provide the basis upon which Pound suggests the musical and somatic aspects are to be organised: A l'entrade del tens ciar - eya! Pir joie recomen?ar - eya! E pir jalous irritar ? eya! Vol la regine mostrar kele est si amoreuse Refrain: A la vie, a la vie, jalous Lassaz nos, lassaz nos Bailar entre nos, entre nos [When cometh the clear time in, eya! / That our joys we may begin, eya! / To stir up the jealous men, eya! / Is our queen to show again what gifts she has for playing. / Jealousy be gone / Go we now a dancing our own way.]43 40 Pound, The Spirit of Romance, 39. Aubry also includes the text, and a transcribed melody, of this song in Trouv?res and Troubadours. He remarks of 'A L'Entrada': 'This "dancing-song" is written in a very ancient and simple form. It is composed of single-rhymed verses sung by a soloist, followed by a refrain repeated by the chorus' (46?7). Van der Werf includes it in The Chansons of the Troubadours and Trouv?res, remarking: 'This chanson occurs in manuscript X, fo. 82, only and has been included primarily to show the difference in poetic style between a dancing song and the vast majority of the songs in the Old Proven?al and Old French chansonniers . . . In fact neither the melody nor the text contain any indication for a specific meter. Furthermore, since nothing is known about the meter of medieval dances, there is no reason to take it for granted that all dancing songs were performed in a ternary meter. Thus I can do no better than follow the example of the medieval scribe and present the melody here in a non-mensural notation' (98). William D. Paden, Jr. makes it clear that Pound consulted manuscript X in Paris whilst working on Hesternae Rosae. See 'Pound's Use of Troubadour Manuscripts', 406?7. 42 Pound, ABC of Reading, 14. 43 This version of the text and the following translation by Pound are taken from Rummel, Hesternae Rosae, 37?9.</page><page sequence="20">72 Charles Mundye The song text consists of three stanzas, each followed by a refrain. The content of the song concentrates on the vitality of Spring, represented in particular through the potential sexual avidity of the quasi-anthropomorphic 'April like Queen'. As a point of internal contrast the second stanza introduces an aging king, whose potential for spoiling the party is overcome by the repetition of the refrain, and the Queen's insistence on the irrepressible drives of youth and sex. The most noticeable initial quality of the text is its rhythmic variety and subtle dislocation. The first line, 'A l'entrade del tens ciar - eya', has seven syllables up to the break, followed by the nonsense word which is split in the musical setting into three sung syllables ? 'e?y?a'. The shape is in part guided by the assonantal echoes within the opening lines. The end-rhyme 'ar' echoes and half-rhymes with the 'e' vowel endings within the text ? 'joie', 'entrade', and also picks up on and modifies the opening 'A'; this vowel sound is then recapitulated in the refrain ending ? 'eya'. This assonant pattern is not confined to terminal word syllables. These first lines concentrate on various modulations of 'a' and 'e' vowel sounds; note, for instance, the subtle variations on the 'e' through the three consecutive syllables '. . . de del tens'. This creates a patterned disturbance by giving the ear a series of subtly variant internal sound structures which play against an unstable concept of line length (does the 'Une' end before or after the exclamatory refrain?). The subsequent text provides a further combination of destabilising and confirming forces: line four 'vol la regine mostrar' is not punctuated by the 'eya' refrain, but picks up on the same major rhyme ending ~ 'ar' (further support is here given to the sound patterns on 'a' and 'e' in 'la regine'). Line five, 'kele est si amoreuse', provides the first end-rhyme variation by modulating the hitherto four times repeated 'ar' to 'amoreuse', and so on in a stanza that consists of intricate sound systems of repeat and variation. It is followed by the stanzaic refrain, which substantially picks up on and further modulates these sounds, with the final Une, 'bailar entre nos, entre nos', more firmly estabUshing the sense of a smaller three-syllable sub-unit adumbrated in the preceding line's repeated phrase, 'lassaz nos'. This repetition also places 'nos' in both lines in the position of end-rhyme prominence; that the final-syllable rhyme of the refrain repeats exactly the same word serves to concentrate the importance of the first-person plural pronoun, which in turn directs our attention towards the communal celebration of the text. The repetition of 'nos' ('ourselves') emphasises the central movement of the text, which is towards a reconciliation of the diverse into the collective dance, a movement that is implied structurally by the drawing together of the diversity of sound throughout. The carefully structured sound mechanics of this song text are commensurate with the qualities Pound located in, for instance, the songs of Arnaut Daniel and other medieval composers, and indeed within his experience of Arabic music. Pound remarked in 1920, in The New Age: In this Arabian music, as in the Provencal metrical scheme, the effect of the subtler repetitions only becomes apparent in the third or fourth strophe, and then culminates in the fifth or sixth, as a sort of horizontal instead of perpendicular chord. One might call it a 'sort</page><page sequence="21">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 73 of counterpoint; if one can conceive a counterpoint which plays not against a sound newly struck, but against the residuum and residua of sound which hangs in the auditory memory.44 Two further stanzas of the song 'A L'Entrade' are included in the Hesternae Rosae setting, which reiterate, modify and expand on the textual sound patterning established in the opening stanza. However, 'A L'Entrade' is arranged for solo voice, so the collective communal drama of the text is implied, not enacted. Pound had provided an English translation for the songs in Hesternae Rosae, which required that the melody be potentially suitable for two different textual systems. No matter how much he tried to equate the general form of his translated text with the original, this exercise in accessibility created a series of two-way compromises between the melody and texts, some of which are mentioned in a rather confusing caveat in the preface: As to the rendering of these melodies, the writer wishes to point out that in employing measures in the re-constitution of the melodies he had in a few cases (mainly in the translations) to place unaccented syllables on the first beat, which, however, does not indicate necessarily that these syllables should receive a blow.45 The melodies of the songs in Hesternae Rosae were accompanied by piano, an instrument which for Pound became the antithesis of refinement of musical expression.46 Indeed, the piano accompaniment provided for these songs often seems completely inappropriate in terms of both the formal and conceptual aspects of the songs. The piano passage (Ex. 6), between the first stanza and the refrain, is typical of the sort of misplaced accompaniment throughout. Despite its attempt at fluid rapidity in the demisemiquaver run, the general feel of this passage is lumpen and rhythmically stolid, no matter how quickly it might be played; it seems more suited to a funeral march than a song of regenerative joy. As with the other songs in Hesternae Rosae, the melody of this dance song is rationalised into repetitive rhythmic patterns. The three stanzas are also strophically set, and so the first melodic phrase (Ex. 7) of the song is repeated, with some small pitch variation, for the setting of the first three lines of each stanza (it also provides the basic pattern for the melodic setting of lines five and six). The dotted quaver/semiquaver pattern creates some dynamic movement, but this is counter acted by the otherwise rather limited use of the simple duple and quadruple measures, despite the heavily marked syncopations. This musical line fails to re-enact the required energetic movement with sufficient complexity to respond to the variety of sound textures and structural systems of the text itself. It is surely a combination of the effects of these various compromises that prompted Pound's late footnote to his discussion of this song in The Spirit of Romance: Schafer, E^ra Pound and Music, 224. 45 Rummel, Hesternae Rosae, [v]. 46 See, for example, Pound's article in The New Age, 1 January 1920: 'The pye-ano, Gentlemen, the PYE-ano is the largest musical instrument known to man, with the possible exceptions of the Steam Calliope Whistle or Fog Signal and the three-barrelled pipe-organ'.

'Curiously enough the notation of one melody found with these words does not seem able to support the full vigor of their movement. At any rate when working with Walter Rummel a few years after writing the above we were unable to get a musical interpretation having the same force.'47 A far more modern outbreak: Pound's modernist stage Whilst the dance song in Hesternae Rosae lacked sufficient 'force', the development of his musical thinking about such issues is manifest in the composition of Le Testament. The song 'P?re No?' provided Pound with an opportunity to stage somatic drama, free from the various compromises imposed on him in the earlier transcription of 'A L'Entrade'. 'P?re No?' is written for a full vocal ensemble and a variety of instruments, and its melodic line is through-composed. The vocal line is mainly in triple and duple time throughout, as opposed to the micro-rhythmic complexities of several of the other songs in the opera. Although a single voice can balance intricate textual rhythms with forceful directionality, this is harder to achieve in a musical group context. Very fine rhythmic distinction is partly sacrificed to enact energetic direction, and to provide sufficient rhythmic coherence for the several voices to synchronise. The hedonistic booziness of the song is also better explained musically by a broader rhythmic brush. There is in this song a powerful rhythmic exuberance. 47 Pound, The Spirit of Romance, 40.

But this is only one element of the rhythmic complexity of the song. The poetic text displays its own powerful rhythmic force: 'P?re No?, qui plantas tes la vigne'. It works in long ten-syUable Unes, encouraging rhythmic expansiveness. The musical rhythms and punctuations derive themselves from this verse, and from their own rhythmic material. This Une is further complicated by the accompaniment; for extended periods, the duple time of the vocal line is sung in syncopation over an accompaniment in triple time, in a kind of sustained mathematical incommensurabiUty that suggests the paradox of controlled instabiUty. In Example 8, the rhythmic pattern predominant in the melody of 'P?re No?' is comparable to the similar dynamic movement of the transcription of 'A L'Entrade'. However, the earlier song never develops beyond basic repetition of this pattern; it cannot exploit group vocal dynamics and achieves no fruitful tension between the vocal Une and its accompaniment. The dramatic moment in the opera demands a crowd scene in which chaotic movement flows in and out of pattern.

"T/4rt Ja -Ji* ex-?Ktitt ?I Ex. 8: Z^ Testament, 'P?re No?'. as many instruments as possible play in groups that either reinforce the pattern of the melodic line, or establish counter-rhythms against that line. Their sound is far more continuous, overturning the semi-pointillistic, discrete sections of instrumen tal support that characterise much of the orchestration of the other songs, all of which combines to produce a many-textured cacophony which nevertheless adheres to strict rhythmical patterns. This results in maximum noise, maximum cohesion yet maximum diversity; Pound achieves rhythmic variety in the crowd scene without sacrificing clarity or cohesion; drunken chaos is artistically re-enacted by controlled complexity. The song 'celebrates' the life, and prays for the soul of Jean Cotart, a lawyer and drinker who, in the scheme of Villon's poem, Le Testament, had previously assisted the poet. Ironic in its address, it appeals to three notorious drinkers, the first of whom is Noah, to mediate for Cotart's salvation. It is an elegiac song inasmuch as it 'prays' for the dead man, but it is much more interested in the detail of his debauchery when alive than anything else; it is a bacchanal, defined by its own exuberance. Pound develops several refrains throughout the song: first the poem's own, repeated at the end of each stanza; and several further lines of text are also repeated throughout. But Villon's text doesn't include the nonsense word refrain so characteristic of the medieval dance song. It seems likely that in the first instance a confluence of sound between a fragment of a line from Villon's poem, and a nonsense refrain from a trouv?re Aube, or dawn song, led to an important interpolation: Et ne deust il avoir vaillant ung pigne; (hu et hu et hu et hu et hu et) Certes, sur tous, c'estoit ung bon archier</page><page sequence="25">Pound's musical modernism and the interpretation of medieval song 77 [And although he was always broke / (hu et hu), / certainly above aU, he was a great boozer.] The nonsense refrain picks up on the assonantal patterning and rhythm of Villon's phrase, 'Certes, sur tous, c'estoit', and it provides Pound with a further musical intensity, but it also introduces once more into the opera, and at a key moment, a fragment of an original trouv?re song. The nod towards the earUer tradition is expanded when the main text of the song is interrupted briefly between stanzas two and three by a solo male voice who sings the whole first stanza of the Aube from which the earlier refrain is taken: Gaite de la tor, Gardez entor Les murs se Deus vos voie, Cor sont a sejor Dame et seignor Et larron vont en proie. [Watcher of the tower, / Look around the walls, / And God befriend you; / For now at rest / Are lady and lord, /And the robber is on the prowl.]48 Margaret Fisher is surely right to claim the dramatic significance of this interruption: the dawn song genetically represents a warning that 'day' and potential retribution are Uterally on the horizon, and at the end of 'P?re No?' the directions call for Villon to be arrested and carried off to the gibbet, from where the closing scene and song of the opera is sung.49 In this respect the echo from an earlier tradition prefigures the danger of Villon's dramatic situation. However, it has a further significance as an intertextual marker that makes expUcit the way Pound has worked from the earlier medieval traditions throughout. He sets the trouv?re lyric, for which at least one 'original' melody exists, to his own sympathetic melodic line, incorporating, and yet allowing to stand sUghtly separate, this nod towards an earUer song tradition with which he had such sympathy, such professional understanding, and yet from which he took a technique that he subsequently deployed in the creation of his own contemporary and deeply complex musical idiom. Coda Daniel Leech-Wilkinson has commented on the ways in which serious work in the field of medieval musicology might provide the basis for a radical reconfiguration of how we view the music of the past, and what we do with it: If we do want to try to know something, however mistaken, about what happened in the past, we need all the hard evidence we can get. When we use it, of course, we are not 48 This version of the text, and translation, is from Aubry, Trouv?res and Troubadours, 73. Aubry provides the full text of, and a commentary on, this song. 49 See the extensive sleeve notes to the compact disc Ego Scriptor Cantilenae: The Music of E^ra Pound, Other Minds, OM 1005-2 CD, 2003, 34.</page><page sequence="26">78 Charles Mundye impartial observers; indeed, we may not wish to be observers at all, but rather to use medieval materials quite openly to construct something new.50 In Canto LIII, Pound records the injunction of 'Tching Tang', a Chinese 'Emperor' reigning 1766-1753 BC: Tching prayed on the mountain and wrote MAKE IT NEW on his bath tub Day by day make it new51 Pound is reformulating a phrase that has subsequently been used to encapsulate the revolutionary and form-breaking agenda, not only of Pound's work, but indeed of his whole generation of modernists. The irony that this phrase is part of Pound's appeal to the importance of learning from the past is never lost on the careful reader. A similar doubleness lies at the heart of his musical composition: he was trained, and then further trained himself, to the professional standards of his contemporary medieval musicologists, and in deploying the lessons he learned as a creative musician he prefigures the kinds of favoured interpretation of the monodic song line current amongst many of our contemporary musicologists and perform ers. But he was intent on creating something new, and at the same time his music is characteristic of its moment, characteristic in presenting and reworking the past 'authentically', and yet doing so in an idiom that is experimental, rhythmically and dramatically complex, and very much of a piece with its avant-garde time and place. Of course 'modernist' music and the serious revival of early music grew together throughout the first half of the twentieth century and beyond, and there is much more to be said about the inevitably close relationship between these strangely contemporaneous and yet historically distant art forms.52 No other work of music theatre, however, is more representative, more characteristic of this relationship, than Ezra Pound's remarkable Le Testament.^ Leech-Wilkinson, The Modern Invention of Medieval Music, 10. 51 Ezra Pound, The Cantos (London, 1989), 264-5. 'Canto LIU', first published 1940. Richard Taruskin, one of the most influential critics of the concept of 'authenticity', has made the claim that musical modernism is not only related to the revival of early music, but also that it has dictated the aesthetic terms of 'authenticist' performing style: 'Yet the ideal of authenticist performance grew up alongside modernism, shares its tenets, and will probably decline alongside it as well. Its values, its justification, and, yes, its authenticity, will only be revealed in conjunction with those of modernism'. Text and Act (New York and Oxford, 1995), 102. On a practical note, the opera continues to reach an ever broader audience. It has been commercially recorded as a complete work twice: Le Testament de Villon, cond. Robert Hughes, Western Opera Theater, Fantasy Records, 12001, 1971; Le Testament de Villon, cond. Reinbert de Leeuw, ASKO Ensemble/ASKO Koor, Philips, 9500 927, Holland Poetry Festival 1980. The compact disc Ego Scriptor Cantilenae: The Music of E^ra Pound contains extensive excerpts from Le Testament along with sections from Pound's two other original works of music theatre, Cavalcanti and Collis O Heliconii. Three volumes of Pound's music scores, edited by Robert Hughes and Margaret Fisher, have now been issued by the publisher Second Evening Art: Cavalcanti (Emeryville, California, 2003); Complete Violin Works of E^ra Pound (Emeryville, California, 2004); The Recovery of E^ra Pound's Third Opera Collis O Heliconii (Emeryville, California, 2005). A published edition of the score to Pound's Le Testament is forthcoming.</page></plain_text>
