<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RAFIDITES: A PRELIMINARY STUDY by W. Montgomery Watt Edinburgh Hellmut Ritter zum 7o. Geburtstage This study is not an attempt to survey the source material about the RMfi&lt;dites exhaustively, but rather to ask some questions about assumptions and presuppositions-questions which ought to be faced before such a survey is undertaken. If provisional answers are suggested, that is largely in the hope of stimulating further consideration of the questions. I. THE HERESIOGRAPHICAL TRADITION Little attention has been paid to the nature of the heresiographical tradition in Islam since the pioneer article of Hellmut Ritter on Muham- medanische Hdresiographen in: Der Islam 18/1929/34-59. Recent studies and editions of IHanbalite material in particular, however, make further attention to this subject a matter of urgency, since there are many discrepancies between Ifanbalite heresiography and the standard tradition, which is mainly Mu'tazilite and AM'arite. 1 If the Maqdldt al-Isldmfyin of al-AM'ari and the Firaq as-9?'a of an-Naubaxti are examined with regard to their structure, it is evident that both authors were attempting to bring some order into an unwieldy mass of historical phenomena. In this they mostly follow the natural procedure of arranging the sects according to the imim they professed to acknowledge. Thus an-Naubaxti (p. 19) says that on the death of 'Ali those who believed in his imimate as a matter of divine institution divided into three sects: those who thought he was not dead, but would return to establish justice on the earth; those who thought he was succeeded by al-HI.asan; those who thought he was succeeded by Mu- hammad b. al-IHanafiya. A little later, however (p. 23 f.), he describes what happened on the death of al-HIusain, and mentions one group of people who thought that Muhammad was best fitted to be the imdm 1 This is further discussed by the present writer in connection with the name Jahmiyyah in: JRAS 1962, 38-57. IIO</page><page sequence="2">The Rifitdites: A preliminary study III after al-IHusain, and another group which held that Muhlammad had been imdm all along and had sent al-.Hasan and al-IH.usain to fight against the Umaiyads. Next comes a consideration of what happened on the death of Muhammad b. al-I;Ianafiya: and so on. Now some of these sects or groups consist of people who were active at a period much later than the various events named-the deaths of 'Ali and his sons. These sects were basing their claims, by which they justified their activity in the present, on allegations about what had happened at some time in the past. What an-Naubaxti is doing-and to a lesser extent al-AM'ari-is to regard the allegations about past events as views held by persons contemporary with these events. Thus when 'Ali was killed in 661 there was probably nobody who thought that he was succeeded by Ibn al-H.Ianafiya; it was only towards 685 with the revolt of al-Muxtir that people would be interested in such a view. There are many other instances of this ascription of views or allegations about historical events to the contemporaries of these events. Once this point is admitted certain important methodological questions have to be raised. The first question to be raised is why the Muslims were so interested in arguing about the past. The answer appears to be that it was not historical curiosity, but that this type of argument about the distant past was the form which discus- sions of current politics took among the Muslims. Why this should be so is not clear to us; it may have had something to do with the autocratic character of the cAbb~sid regime which made more direct discussion of politics dangerous. Whatever the explanation, the fact can hardly be doubted. It is indeed only natural to suppose that if men devote much effort and vehemence to such an argument, something more important than a scholarly interest in history is involved. It follows from these considerations that the modern scholar who is trying to reconstruct the history of Si'ism must disregard statements that belong primarily to the architectonic of the heresiographers, and must try to discover the religious and political views actually held by individual men whom he can name and date, and also the political activities in which they engaged. It is not always easy, of course, to dis- cover information of this kind. Even when there is an assertion that a particular man held a particular view, the student has to consider who made the assertion and in what ways the man's real view may have been distorted. Once as much information as possible of the kind desiderated has been obtained the question has to be asked how the individual men are related</page><page sequence="3">112 W. Montgomery Watt to one another. It should not be assumed that all the individuals and sects belong to a single "Si'ite movement" which split up into a number of separate divisions. This is only one of two or three possible hypotheses to explain the complex of historical phenomena, though it is the one suggested by the structure of the accounts of the heresiographers. An alternative is that the various sects enumerated were almost entirely independent of one another, and that there was no general "Si'ite movement". Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes. Many of the sects, especially of the Oulht or extreme Si'a, seem to have been small local or regional affairs, virtually independent of one another. It may be admitted, however, that the various phenomena had a com- mon substrate, which gave them an appearance of similarity and unity; but this substrate was much vaguer and less determinate than anything which could be called a "movement"; it was rather a trend of thought, a frame of mind, or even a largely unconscious attitude. The essence of it was the widespread need for a charismatic leader. This was a need that could be met, at least temporarily, by men of various sorts, provided they could claim to have a charisma, either by birth or as the represen- tative of a man with such a charisma. The records show that during the Umaiyad period charismata were attributed to men from several different branches of the clan of HdSim: besides the descendants of al-I;Husain recognized by the later ImSmites and Ismi'ilites, there were descendants of his brothers al-Hasan and Ibn al-HIanafiya, of Ca'far b. Abi Tdlib and of the Prophet's uncle al-'Abbds (cf. Montgomery Watt, Shf' ism under the Umayyads, in: JRAS 1960/158-72). From this it must be concluded that, even among persons of Si'ite sympathies, there was no widespread recognition of the right of the Husainids to the imdmate until some time after 750. Still less was there any general acceptance of the conception of "designation" (nass), that is, the right and duty of the imdm to "designate" his successor, with the corollary that 'Ali was "designated" by God and Muhammad; it is probable, however, that the idea of "designation" was sometimes used, and not only by the IHusainids. These considerations lead to a further question: What was the position of the HI.usainid imdms during their lifetime, and to what extent had they a politically active following? The first imdm who seems likely to have meddled in politics to any extent after al-H.usain was his great- grandson Ca'far as-Sddiq (d. 765). Ca'far's father Muhammad al-Bdqir (d. 731) is said to have been recognized as imim by several sects, but this may have been after his death, or during his lifetime without his being involved. Ca'far was doubtless encouraged to enter the political field</page><page sequence="4">The Rdfi1dites: A preliminary study 113 by the prospects of gaining some prize in the break-up of the Umaiyad empire. If, as has been suggested (cf. Bernard Lewis, The Origins of Ismd'clism, Cambridge 1940, 30-43), the split between Ca'far and his son Ismc'il was due to the latter's desire to support certain revolutionary groups, this would indicate that Ca'far, perhaps after the establishment of the 'Abbdsids, had decided that meddling in politics was too dangerous. The remaining imdms of the Im~mites seem to have been politically quiescent. Even the Imdmite tradition, which tries to make out that they claimed the imamate and received widespread recognition while they lived, can produce little real evidence (the Imdmite tradition is summa- rized in D. M. Donaldson, The Shi'ite Religion, London 1933). One of the best known facts is that Ca'far's grandson, 'Ali ar-RitdI, became heir to the throne and married al-Ma'miin's daughter in 817. He died, however, in Sept. 818; and from the fact that his son Muhammad al-Cawid was not appointed as heir in his place, it might be argued that al-Ma'miin felt that his pro-Si'ite policy had failed; on the other hand, since the son was only nine or less when his father died, he was doubtless too young to be officially appointed heir. He lived in favour at court until his death in 835. On the other hand, his son, 'Ali an-Naqi or al-Hidi, was imprisoned soon after the decisive change of policy about 849, and remained in prison until his death in 868. He does not seem to have been closely incarcerated, and the government may have acted chiefly in order to keep him under surveillance. They presumably thought that there was some danger from him, but that it was not serious. His son al-Hasan al-'Askari (d. 874) was imprisoned for a little after his death, and then set free. The twelfth imim was the latter's son Muhammad al-Mahdi, who disappeared or died about the time of his father's death (if he ever existed). He certainly cannot himself have taken any part in politics. Thus it may be concluded that from 818 to 874 the imims took no active part in politics, and that there are no traces of any underground move- ment connected with them. 2. THE RAFIDITE THEOLOGIANS When an attempt is made to obtain precise information of the type described above, a useful beginning is found in some lists of Rdfidite theologians and writers, namely in Kitdb al-Intisdr, edited by H. S. Nyberg (p. 6), in Maqdldt al-Isldmimyin of al-AM'ari (63 f.), and in the Fihrist of Ibn an-Nadim (175-8). There is also an interesting account by al-Mas'~iidi in Muric ad-Dahab (6/369-76) of a symposium on love in which a number of Mu'tazilite and Rifidite theologians took part. Oriens 16 8</page><page sequence="5">114 W. Montgomery Watt Al-AM'ari (Maq. 31-63) gives a number of theological views, mostly of the men mentioned in the lists. There are also reports about the views of particular men in the later heresiographers. This provides a sufficient basis of information for the formulation of certain conclusions. The theological activity of the men whose names we are given must be about the end of the eighth century and in the first half of the ninth (with one or two still later). The symposium on love described by al-Mas- 'idi took place in the house of Yahyd ibn Xdlid al-Barmaki, and must therefore have been before his fall in 803. One of the participants-perhaps the eldest, since he was the first to speak-was 'Ali ibn Mitam, who is said in the Fihrist to have been the first theologian of the sect. cAll b. Mitam is probably the correct reading. Yaqit, Irs d 5/453-9, has an CAll b. Haitam, who was a secretary to al-Ma'mfin; but he is probably different, since he was a Zaidite and apparently younger. CAll b. Mitam is also said, however, in Intisar 99, to have argued with CAli al-Aswdri, a Muctazilite, of the generation of al-Cdhiz (d. 869). The most prominent Rdfidite theologian, however, who was also at the symposium, was HiSvm b. al-Hakam. The date of his death does not appear to be given anywhere-those in the Index of the Maqdldt are too late. The suggestion of the Fihrist that he died in the caliphate of al-Ma'mlin (813-33) seems to be about right, since he argued with the Mu'tazilite Abii l1-Hudail, and seems to have been roughly a contempora- ry, and Abii 1-Hudail is said to have died in 840, but does not seem to have been active much after 825. Hikim b. al-HIakam wrote books criticizing the views of two RMfidites, HiSvm b. Sdlim al-Cawdliqi and Muhammad b. 'Ali b. an-Nu'mdn, known as Sait.n at-Tdq; and so these must have lived about the same period. Another Rifidite, Muhammad b. Xalil as-Sakkdk (of whose name there are several variants), argued against the Mu'tazilites al- Isk~fi and Ca'far ibn I;Iarb, who are said to have died about 854 and 850; this fits in very well, since in the Fihrist he is called a pupil of Hitvm b. al-HIakam. Al-AM'ari also mentions some R~fidite Traditionists, of whom one was al-Fadl ibn dddEn (d. 874; GAL 1/199). Somewhat distinct from the men just mentioned are those who were active after the death or disappearance of the Twelfth Imdm in 874. The Fihrist mentions Abfi Sahl Ismd'il an-Naubaxti (d. 923) and his nephew al-HIfasan b. Mfisd an-Naubaxti (d. 912), both of whom wrote books on general philosophical theology as well as books of Si'ite apologetics (cf. Introduction to H. Ritter's edition of Firaq a?-S_'a; also GAL S 1/319. The present argument is not affected by the possibility that Firaq al-'a should be ascribed to someone else; cf. Oriens 7/204). As founder of the</page><page sequence="6">The Rdfi1dites: A preliminary study 115 specific Imdmite legal rite Brockelmann names Abi~ Ca'far al-Qummi (d. 903), while he also assigns a prominent place to al-Kulini (d. 939). This is as far as the matter need be followed here. The first group of theologians, those round Hi'im b. al-;Iakam, discussed many of the same questions as the Mu'tazilites of the period, though they had a tendency to anthropomorphism, and the Mu'tazilites often seem to have made fun of them. In the account of their doctrines in K. al-Intisdr (5 f.) they are said to have held that God has a form and an originated knowledge, that he reverses decisions, that he wills all evil, that there will be a return (rac'a) to this world before the resurrection, that the Qur'dn has been altered and that Muhammad clearly marked his successor, though most Muslims have not recognized him; there are also some differences of detail in their performance of the saldt. Another account of them, from a different standpoint, is given by Ibn Qutaiba in his Ta'wil Muxtalif al-IHadft (6; 259 ff.; cf. 84 ff., 97). He speaks of them as preferring 'Ali to the 'aixain (Abfi Bakr and 'Umar), but places the chief emphasis on the fact that they consider most of the Companions unbelievers; this last point is, of course, a consequence of their view that Muhlammad clearly designated 'Ali as his successor. The accounts of their views on particular points given by al-AM'ari in Maqdldt al- Isldmiyin are in keeping with the information in the Intisdr. So far we are given a picture of academic theologians with no undue interest in contemporary politics. The most significant remark in this respect is that of al-AM'ari (58) that they "agreed in holding insurrection wrong and rejecting the sword, even if they are killed, until their imdm appears and orders them to act in this way". Though he was writing after 874, his word "agreed" would naturally include the earlier Rdfi- .dites also. He also speaks of them (53) as all rejecting the use of "inde- pendent judgement" (ictihdd ar-ra'y), presumably in legal matters; and this indeed follows from their conception of the imam. It also appears that they were developing their own system of Traditions, dependent not on dubious Companions but on their own imams, such as Ca'far as-.Sdiq and his son Miisd (Intisdr 136). If the views of those who lived after 874 are left aside for the moment, it is clear that the Rdfi&lt;dite theologians whose names we know were not supporters of the IHusainid imdms; and there is no evidence of their being connected with any political movement involving the living .Iusainid imams. At most they narrated Traditions from long-dead imams; Ca'far had died in 765 and Miss in 799, whereas al-Xaiyit was apparently writing after the death of al-Cahiz in 869.</page><page sequence="7">116 W. Montgomery Watt 3. THE MEANING OF THE NAME Linguistically the name "RMfidites" comes from the verb rafada, probably with the meaning "desert", and so could be rendered "desert- ers". It is thus an unpleasant nickname applied by opponents, and not always applied in the same way (A. S. Tritton, Muslim Theology, London 1947, 20, gives references to five explanations). It is often said that it was Zaid b. 'Ali, the !i'ite insurgent of about 740, whom they "deserted" or refused to help; and certainly in the ninth century the Zaidites and the RMfidlites were two opposing groups. It seems unlikely, however, that this was the original use, for one of the very few times when the term "Imdmiya" is used in the Maqdldt (64.5) is when al-AM'ari is quoting from a Zaidite source. In K. al-Intisdr al-Xaiydt seems to speak of Rdfi&lt;da where the work he is criticizing speaks of the !i'a (cf. 4.8 ff. with 5.3 ff.; also 4.3 from foot; repetition with change). It is almost certain that al-AM'ari (p. 16) is right in saying that they were called "deserters" because they "deserted" Abfi Bakr and 'Umar. This only answers the question about meaning in a superficial sense. The deeper question that ought to be faced is what this implied in the ninth century, since it was apparently in no way an attempt to establish the IHusainid imdms, that is, to replace the 'Abbdsids by a living member of the family of Ca'far as-Sddiq. The primary political assertions of the RMfidites were that Muhammad had designated 'Ali to succeed him, and that the rest of the Companions had failed to carry out Muhammad's instructions and so were virtually unbelievers (cf. Intisdr 105 f.). It follows that Abii Bakr and 'Umar were never imdms at all, but only usurpers. There is a clear contrast here with the Zaidite position accord- ing to which, although 'Ali was best fitted to be imim, the "imdmate of the inferior" (imdmat al-mafid~al) was permissible (cf. Maqdldt 68; Farq bain al-Firaq 23; etc.; in Fihrist 176 Hiiam b. al-JHakam wrote a book against those who held the doctrine of imdmat al-maf~d~tl, while ;aitdn at- Tdq wrote one on this subject against the Mu'tazila, presumably the Zaidite section of them). The problem thus becomes a double one, since the Zaidites of the middle ninth century are as difficult to understand as the Rdfidites. There were some revolts whose leaders the heresiographers regard as Zaidites; for example, that of Miisd b. al-Qdsim in 834, and that of Yahyd b. 'Umar in 864. Yet these seem to be relatively local and isolated affairs, not involving the main body of Zaidite opinion. That there was such a body towards the middle of the century seems to be assured by the fact that al-C.hiiz in the opening sentence of his Risila fi Baydn Maddhib a?-SI'a says that the Si'ites are divided into RMfidites</page><page sequence="8">The Rafi~1ites: A preliminary study 117 and Zaidites, and that apart from these there are only scattered and disorderly groups or individuals (in Macmi'at Rasd'il, Cairo 19o6, 178-85; as Goldziher notes in Vorlesungen, 359 foot, there is little infor- mation in it. The general point is confirmed by the polemics of the Zaidite al-Qasim b. Ibrdhim (d. 86o) against the RMfidites; cf. GAL 1/197; Strothmann, Staatsrecht der Zaiditen, Strassburg 1912, 48). Before trying to decide about the political relevance of the doctrines held it is necessary to remind oneself that there were many political changes in the course of the century. The outstanding change was the reversal about 849 of the pro-?i'ite policy inaugurated by al-Ma'mfin. With this policy was linked the so-called Inquisition or Mihna, whereby government officials were required to state publicly that they believed the Qur'dn was created and not uncreated. The name "pro-?i'ite policy" must not be taken too exactly, but only as a rough description; the administration was probably trying to work out a compromise which would gain them the support of the vague but widespread body of moderate ?i'ite opinion. The theological position of the administration, in so far as it had one, was in fact Mu'tazilite, and many Mu'tazilite theologians were close to government circles. Now some of the Mu'tazi- lites were also Zaidites or very nearly so; and before 849 the Zaidites may therefore have been among the supporters of the 'Abbdsid govern- ment. On the other hand, the Zaidites are not prominent in K. al-Intisdr, which was probably written towards the end of the century, although there is much about the Rdfidites-more than is explained by the fact that al-Xaiydt regards the man he is criticizing, Ibn ar-RIwandi, as a RMfidite. Indeed it is recorded (p. 89) that the people of the town of 'Andt (or 'Ana) on the Euphrates were converted from the Zaidite position (as taught by Sulaimdn b. Carir) to the Mu'tazilite by Ca'far b. MubasAir (d. 848). Another sign of change was the brief appearance and then disap- pearance of a sect of 'Utm~niya, with which al-Cdhiz was connected. What then were the immediate political concerns of the RMfitdites and the Zaidites ? They were not concerned, it is being taken as admitted, to replace the 'Abbdsids by descendants of Ca'far as-Sddiq or of Zaid- any more than the 'Utmdniya were trying to restore the Umaiyads. This was the form taken by party political strife in the caliphate at this period. There are grounds for thinking that, as suggested above, the Mu'tazilites were trying to achieve some sort of compromise (cf. Mont- gomery Watt, The Political Attitudes of the Mu'tazilah, in: JRAS 1962). The Zaidite position might then be regarded as a variant of this. The Zaidites were trying to placate the Sunnites by acknowledging the caliphates of Abi Bakr and 'Umar, though sometimes adding that they</page><page sequence="9">118 W. Montgomery Watt were "inferior"; they mostly thought that a new imim ought to be appointed by a small council-a procedure that was perhaps still within the bounds of political reality. This may suffice provisionally, since it is not the Zaidites who are being specifically studied here. A clue to an understanding of the Rififdites is perhaps to be found in the remark of Ignaz Goldziher (Vorlesungen 234) that it is "rather the spirit of absolutism (sc. than of freedom) which permeates the religious outlook of Si'ism". Louis Massignon has some similar remarks, but they will be considered more closely in the next section. If there is something in these suggestions, then, can it be that what the Rifiidites were hoping for was a greater degree of absolutism in the existing 'Abbdisid regime? The designation of each imim or caliph by his predecessor would strength- en his position by giving him a "divine right" to rule, and would perhaps have been a feasible method in the circumstances of the time, before the advent of Turkish generals as caliph-makers. The 'Abbisid claim to the caliphate does not seem to have been clearly formulated in respect of the method of appointment. It had originally been some form of desig- nation, though the word nass does not appear to have been used, and had been received through Muhammad b. al-I.anafiya; but during the caliphate of al-Mahdi (775-85) the alternative claim had been put forward that the rightful imim after the Prophet had been al-'Abbds (cf. an-Naubaxti 43). It may have been difficult, however, to get evidence for the appointment of al-'Abbis comparable to that for the designation of 'Ali. The focus of interest, however, was perhaps not the caliphal dignity itself, but the forms in which the decisions of the caliph could be in- fluenced. An important body of power and influence within the caliphate was that of the Sunnite Traditionists, who achieved a measure of consoli- dation just after the middle of the ninth century with the composition of the Sahihain. It seems certain that the Rifi4dites represented some rival interest-group, though it is not clear who precisely it was. The Rifidite contention that most of the Companions had disobeyed Mu- hammad by not accepting 'Ali as imim on the Prophet's death dis- qualified them, even in a sense according to Sunnite principles, from transmitting Traditions. This is doubtless why Ibn Qutaiba is so anxious to denounce the Rifidites for their ikfdr as-sahidba. It is also significant that the Rififdites were producing their own rival Traditions, as noted above. Their inclination to regard the Qur'dn as created (Maqdldt 4o. 9; cf. A. A. A. Fyzee, A Shi'ite Creed, London 1942, 85) had a similar effect, though it was perhaps not so important in view of the imim's right of giving the authoritative interpretation. Thus there are grounds for</page><page sequence="10">The Rifi0dites: A preliminary study II9 thinking that Rdfi1ite doctrine was aimed at weakening the position of the Sunnite Traditionists and jurists, and presumably also at strength- ening some other section of the administrative machine. Here then in broad outline is a possible solution of the problem of the deeper meaning of the Rifidite position. What at first sight look like theological abstractions and historical pedantries prove to be elements in the struggle between rival power-blocs. Further study of the complex mass of relevant material may lead to modification of details, but the general lines of this solution appear to be sound. 4. R.AFIDITES AND IMA.MITES There remain two further questions to be asked concerning points which may be connected with one another or may be separate. One question is how and why the Rifidites were replaced by the Imdmites. The other is about the acceptance of the twelve imims, when it came about and in what circumstances. The term "Rdfidite" was always a nickname, not used by the people themselves. Ibn ar-Rlwandi seems to use "'i'a". The real point under- lying the first question then is when it began to be necessary to distin- guish the Rifidites from ?i'ite sects other than the Gulht or extremists. The Ismd'ilites founded the Fitimid state in North Africa in 909, and previously their agents had been active in Syria and further east. The Zaidites were also important during the ninth century, and the occur- rence of the name "Im~miya" in a Zaidite source used by al-AM'ari makes it probable that this term was first used to distinguish the group from the Zaidites; the use of the term "Rdfitdite" by the much later Zaidite writer Ibn al-Murta&lt;d in his Tabaqdt al-Mu'tazila may be explain- ed by his partial reliance of Mu'tazilite and AM'arite sources. A survey of the earlier sources suggests that the new name came into use about 900, though its first employment might be before 850 if it was actually used by al-AM'ari's Zaidite source, Sulaimdn b. Carir. The term "Immilya" is not mentioned in K. al-Intisadr, but there are one or two references to "Ahl al-Imdma" who are presumably the same; they are not clearly distinguished from the Rdfitdites. An-Naubaxti in Firaq a?-Sf'a (90-93) describes a sect of Im~miya, whose views he appears to share. Al-AM'ari speaks three times in the Maqdldt of the Im~miya: once in the report from Sulaimdn b. Carir (64.4), and twice (17.8; 31.9) at points which might be later additions to the manuscript, either by himself or even by a scribe. Apart from this, however, he has several references to men who held the doctrine of the imdma, often in conjunc-</page><page sequence="11">120 W. Montgomery Watt tion with the i'tizdl or Mu'tazilite position. Of the later AM'arite heresio- graphers al-Bagdddi makes the Imdmites a sect of the Rifi1ites, while as-Sahrastdni does not mention the Rdfidites at all, but makes all those formerly so called into Imdmites. What then is to be said about the general recognition of the whole series of twelve imdms? It has been argued above that between 818 and 874 there was a body of persons of Rdfitdite sympathies who had no thought of engaging in political revolts and no connection, even in idea, with those afterwards accepted as imdms. This conclusion is not upset by the fact that there were small groups of malcontents in various places who recognized various imdms. After 874, however, there was a change. It was not simply a change produced by external events-the death of the eleventh imam and the death or disappearance of his young son. The change was produced by an astute politician who realized the advantages of having no living imdm and no immediate possibility of gaining one (and who refused to look for another heir). A living imdm might not always be amenable to the politicians' wishes; he might even be incompetent. In any case the gigantic task of engineering a revolution was necessary before any of the H;Iusainid imams could become an actual ruler. With an imam who had gone into concealment, however, and who was unlikely to return in the visible future, things were much better. The political leaders of the party really had control, and they could not so easily be suspected of plotting revolution. Politically there was much to be gained by believing in a "hidden and expected imdm". From a religious point of view there was also something to be said for this arrangement. There was in the regions of the caliphate a wide- spread yearning for the kind of security that could be given by the knowledge that the leader whom one was following and obeying was divinely inspired. Strange as it seems, this yearning is to some extent met by believing that there is an imdm who will certainly come. For some persons this belief, though it seems to be about matters of temporal history, gives the same comfort and security as belief in an eschatological Messiah. Thus the new doctrine of the Twelve Imdms, of whom the twelfth was hidden and would return, is not simply a political device but has a genuine religious aspect. These general considerations can be closely linked up with the parti- cularities of history. The matter merits a careful study from the stand- point here outlined, but that is a vast enterprise. Provisionally the student may be referred to Louis Massignon's conclusions about the Imimites who were largely responsible for the condemnation of al- I.allic (Passion I/I40-5I). He considers that in the twenty years after</page><page sequence="12">The Rdfi4dites: A preliminary study 121 the death of the eleventh imam the Imdmites were welded into a strong and cohesive body by Abfi Sahl Ismd'il an-Naubaxti. Smaller groups were brought into a comprehensive unity. The whole was concerned to uphold the interests of the old Persian oligarchy, in whose hands was much of the work of administration. This result was reached by a line of thought somewhat different from that being followed here, but in general it gives the picture that the earlier part of this study led one to expect. It is impossible to say with certainty whether the recognition of the twelve imdms was connected with the change of name to Imdmites. What seems to be sure is that without the belief in the twelve imdms and the organization of a party round this belief, the old Rdfi&lt;dite move- ment would have split up and disappeared or become greatly transformed. In conclusion it may be remarked that there are some other relevant points which have not been touched on here. It would be interesting, for instance, to know how the Si'ism of the HIamddnid dynasty was related to the aspects considered here. It is also important to note that the well-known philosopher al-Fdrhbi (d. 950), who was latterly under the protection of the Si'ite Saifaddaula of Aleppo, produced in his al-Madina al-Fddila a political theory which expounds something not unlike Si'ite absolutism. Just as in the universe all existence is derived from God, so in the state everything is derived from the ra'~s, the head. Since several of the Imdmite doctors, such as al-H.Iasan an-Naubaxti, had been interested in philosophy, and al-Fdrdbi had spent some time in Baghdad, there is possibly some actual connection here. Altogether the question of the meaning and extent of ?i'ism in the period from 750 to 950 is well worthy of further study, and it is hoped that what has been said here may encourage some scholars to attempt this.</page></plain_text>
