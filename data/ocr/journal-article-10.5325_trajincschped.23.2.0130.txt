Over the years this class has included thirty, mostly internation- al, students, the majority of whom come from partner universities under the Erasmus exchange program—a program within the European Union designed to promote intercultural understanding among EU member countries. A smaller number of students come from the United States, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Czech Republic, Poland, Latvia, Finland, Hungary, Malta, Romania, Sweden, Côte d’Ivoire, Turkey, Cyprus, India, and Korea. Many of them have some knowledge of Greece and Greek culture. I taught this multicultural and multilingual group in English. I focus on food to advance cross-cultural understanding among the students. I provide them with a variety of sources from history, literature (prose, poetry, and travelers’ texts), visual arts (photographs, fictional films, and documentaries), museum exhibits (prehistoric wall paintings, repre- sentations on ancient vessels and vases, Byzantine icons), and ethnogra- phies. We visit museums, wineries, and restaurants. I share examples of material culture from my family including cookbooks, preserved ceremo- nial breads, bread stamps, and other preindustrial cooking tools. Students also review material on historic, archaeological, and cultural topics from my work as an editor of two Greek magazines—Explore Nature and Travel Book—and watch my documentary film Bread and Cheese: Forms of Popular Culture in the Region of Mount Psiloritis. In the beginning we focus on prac- tical issues. I introduce students to local foods of Crete, we discuss cooking techniques, special dietary habits such as fasting, table manners, and festive and ceremonial dishes. This emphasis on food and foodways helps students to adjust to their new cultural environment. As a theoretical framework, I introduce the class to Derrick Jelliffe’s classification model that organizes food into five categories: 1. Cultural super-foods: the dominant staples and main sources of calories and proteins. Because of their significance for the diet of a community, these foods have a crucial cultural and symbolic role, and are incorporated into mythology, religion, and rituals.  2. Prestige foods: reserved for important occasions; they are associated with the dominant socio-economic group in a particular society. These foods are usually expensive and rare. 3. Body-image foods: considered to affect the functions of the human body, either positively or negatively.  4. Magic foods: believed to have extraordinary properties. 5. Physiologic group foods: cannot be consumed by certain popula- tion groups based on gender, age, or health condition. I ask students to list local foods under these five categories, an activity which requires them to engage more deeply with Cretan culture. They listed bread, olive oil, and wine as super-foods, along with meat (especial- ly game), and fish—such as red mullet or sea bream. Shellfish, such as lob- </page> <page sequence="4"> EFI PSILAKI                                                                                       ster or crayfish, were regarded as prestige foods. Milk, fruit, greens and vegetables as body-image foods; pomegranates, milkwort, Cretan dittany (the herb of love), and nuts were classified as magic foods; broad beans and fish (neither of which, according to Cretan culture, should be con- sumed by children), snails (which are avoided by pregnant women) were listed as physiologic group foods. This activity prompted much discussion because specific foods may change category. For example, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, travelers to the Mediterranean attributed the spread of leprosy to the high consumption of olive oil. Today olive oil is ranked among the healthiest oils. Since my main focus is on bread, I also ask them to think about how cereal crops fit into Jelliffe’s framework both in Greek and in their own cultural histories.  Bread Wheat, olive oil, and wine—the super-foods of Crete—play a significant symbolic role in both ancient and modern religious practices. All three foods are considered gifts from the gods: wheat from Demeter, the olive tree from Athena, and vines from Dionysus. These foods have a central position in popular everyday customs as well as in official religious rites.  Historically, wheat was not the principal cereal grain in Cretans’ every- day diet; the dominant starchy grain was barley (Dalby 22). Today, however, wheat bread is consumed by the lower classes. Barley has been converted into a body-image food, and is in the process of becoming a prestige food.  Wheat bread was a prestige food in preindustrial communities in Crete. This is why ceremonial breads have always been made with white flour. However, their symbolic decoration is what makes them particularly attrac- tive. I introduce students to the importance of ceremonial bread in Crete via pictures and videos and by showing them preserved decorated breads from my collection. We discuss these breads not as isolated works of folk art but as integrated material with particular social functions. We discuss the shape and symbolic meaning of the decorations, which symbols fit each bread, and the specific occasion for which each bread is made. Students learn that ritual Cretan breads are classified into three main categories:  1. Sacred breads: There are two such breads in the Orthodox reli- gion: the Eucharistic bread and the Eulogia bread (Galavaris 40- 166; Psilakis and Psilaki 333-350). Both are stamped with sacred symbols. They are kneaded with white flour, shaped into two loaves which are placed one on top of the other, and stamped with wooden or metal seals.  2. Festive breads: baked only on ceremonial occasions, during festival holidays, but not part of the liturgy. Many are decorated with ela- borate designs. Different breads are made for each specific ceremo- nial occasion.  3. Breads for social occasions: made throughout the life cycle, from birth to death and the memorial services performed after a person’s </page> <page sequence="5">                                                                                                           transformations death. Their highly elaborate symbolic decoration seeks to propiti- ate the powers controlling human life, according to local beliefs.  Classification into these three categories gives students the chance to study Greek breads in parallel to breads from other regions, especially from their own countries (Cutler). They compare, for example, the levened prosphoron, the eucharistic bread of the Orthodox Christian religion, with the unleavened host of Western Christianity, and matza of the Jewish reli- gion. We also discuss wedding breads which are made in all cultures. We compare their symbolic decorations. The symbols on Cretan bread convey important cultural meanings. Plant designs and religious symbols are dom- inant on festive breads. Other breads, like Saint Anthony’s breads, made only in specific regions of Southern Crete, are anthropomorphic—in the form of the human body or of a body part (such as arm, leg, ear, or eye). Since Saint Anthony is honored as a healer in these areas, his breads plead for cure from illness. Hence, the shape of these breads depends on the suf- fering body part. The breads are taken to the church, blessed by the priests, and broken and distributed to the congregation.  Two more breads depict human images. One is baked only in Kalam- baka, a village in Southern Crete, and the other in the Mount Psiloritis villages of central Crete. Kalambaka’s round bread is prepared at Christmas for the sake of the depicted person’s health or cure from illness. The Mount Psiloritis bread is made to remember a dead person on Saint Lazarus’ feast day. It is oblong, up to one meter long, and represents a human body in sleeping position with the hands tied up. It is an effigy of a dead relative represented in the attire he preferred when he was alive and with some unique traits. If he had been a musician, his musical instrument is shaped with dough and placed next to his body. Until a few decades ago, it was common everywhere to bake anthropomorphic or zoomorphic small breads as gifts to children on major holidays, especially Christmas and Easter.  The breads of social occasions hold equal significance. Pregnant women are offered a special type of bread, either on the day of the deliv- ery or the day after, depicting the mother embracing her newborn child, surrounded by flowers and other symbols of happiness. A few days after birth another type of bread, a puppet, prepared with white flour, honey, and spices, is placed next to the newborn’s cradle together with some honey. Parents believe that in this way they can flatter the Fates, who determine the newborn’s future. On the first day the child walks, a bread is made in the shape of a bird, symbolizing flight, and decorated in floral patterns. Breads for bap- tism, engagement, or wedding ceremonies are more elaborately decorat- ed. Baptism bread is dominated by religious symbols, while engagement and wedding breads are decorated with fertility symbols. Birds’ nests with eggs, snakes, mice, scorpions, and other animal or floral patterns orna- ment the upper surface of these breads. Engagement breads usually have </page> <page sequence="6"> EFI PSILAKI                                                                                       bird couples and human hands with engagement rings on the fingers— symbols of union and marriage.  Many students already have some knowledge about breads made in their countries, including festive breads made mainly at Christmas and Easter, such as the Greek christopsomo and tsoureki, Czech vanocka, Polish chalka, Portuguese massa sovada, German stolen, Italian panettone, or British hot cross buns. Breads are also used across cultures for social occasions, mainly for weddings, such as the large, round braided korovai bread orna- mented with suns, moons, owls, herbs, and other animal and floral symbols that are prepared in Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. I ask students to describe the significance of bread in their cultures, and to compare breads of different cultures. They compare symbols of fertility and abundance, such as pinecones, grapes, leaves, flowers, and branches that are common on wedding breads across cultures. The Greek bread of the dead gives them an opportunity to talk about Mexican pan de muertos, which is decorated with bone-like pieces, and provokes a discussion of similar customs regarding the care for the deceased and the practice of offering.  Students discover that Greek and Turkish simit (also koulouri in Greek) has its equivalent in the German, American, Spanish, Italian, and French pretzel, Czech preclík, Dutch krakeling, Norwegian and Danish kringle, Polish precel, Hungarian perec, Bulgarian covrig, and so on. All of these breads are made with simple ingredients, formed into the shape of a ring and are often sold by street vendors as an everyday snack. Tiganites of Greece and Cyprus are similar to the English and American pancakes, French crêpes, Mexican tortillas, Russian blini, German Pfannkuchen, Italian frittella, and Czech and Slovakian palatschinke. I encourage students to share recipes or even bake a loaf of bread from their culture. They realize that there are remarkable similarities in all bread preparations. What is most important, however, is that bread is a staple food item, the staff of life in many cultures. It is used as an offering to the people, to God, to the departed; it is the sign of friendship, of sharing.  • • • Food is a challenging topic area for intercultural teaching. It highlights for students the complexity of human behavior and allows them to view cultures as historically dynamic. Teaching food also helps students to understand social structures, collective and individual attitudes, economies, and the roles of production and labor. In my class, studying food promoted a context for cross-cultural collaboration. Students drew from their own cultural backgrounds to discuss common experiences around food. By eating the food of the “other,” students from around the world could participate in Cretan culture, and share the experience embodied in a dish or in an arranged meal. Examining festive breads allows students to understand a particular cultural environment—in this case Crete—and specific social processes that codify that culture’s cus- toms, symbolic systems, and religious rituals.  </page> <page sequence="7">                                                                                                           transformations Anthropomorphic bread made on St Lazarus’ feast day.
