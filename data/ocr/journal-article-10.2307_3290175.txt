<plain_text><page sequence="1">ACADEME AND GALILEE By STELLA LANGE Chicago, Illinois The interesting paper by President Stob in the January number of the JOURNAL on "Stoicism and Christianity" brings up again a subject that has a perennial fascination for many minds. We are irresistibly tempted to Let the sweet birds of the Lord With earth's waters make accord; Teach how the crucifix may be Carven from the laurel tree, Fruit of the Hesperides Burnish take on Eden trees- in other words, to harmonize the two things that have had most influence upon all serious thought in the western world-Christi- anity and Greek philosophy. Like all fascinating subjects this one has its dangers and its pit- falls, and the cautious distinguo is indispensable in its treatment. It is easy to find parallels, actual or merely verbal, and equally easy to harp on differences, trivial or essential. Classical students are most frequently led astray by the former tendency, theologians by the latter. The matter becomes dangerous from a scholarly point of view only when a writer too hastily assumes from paral- lels, real or fancied, the dependence of one writer upon another, as is frequently done in the case of the later Old Testament books' or in the case of the relations of Seneca and St. Paul. Arguing from parallels is a delicate matter and without other evidence seldom proves conclusive; for it happens to be a fact that, given two writers of similar talent and temperament, in similar environment, 1 So, e.g., the relation of the book of Ecclesiastes to Stoicism and Epicureanism as well as to earlier Greek literature has been hotly debated. 470</page><page sequence="2">ACADEME AND GALILEE 471 dealing with the same subject, they are likely to say very much the same things, especially if the subject be a religious or ethical commonplace or a matter of natural human feeling. Now it is undeniably true that later Stoicism, Neoplatonism, and Neopythagoreanism developed in the same Hellenistic at- mosphere that fostered the growth of Christianity and that all of them bear some impress of the age that brought them forth; yet this would not prevent them from differing widely in many funda- mental matters. President Stob would seem to do well in empha- sizing the fact that the evolution of Christianity was from Judaism rather than from Greek philosophy, although it could not escape the influence of the latter, especially in its later development. We see traces of this in the Gospel of John, and it is very evident in the writings of the early Christian Fathers. But the Synoptic Gospels are very un-Greek in tone and subject-matter, the book of Revela- tion is a natural outgrowth of the plentiful apocalyptical literature preserved in the Old Testament Apocrypha; and only those who are intimately familiar with the writings of both Plato and St. Paul can see the utter dissimilarity in method between the logical reasoning of the one and the psychological exhortation of the other. After this prefatory distinguo to prevent misunderstanding, I should like to point out that the correspondence with Christianity on the three great topics of God, Man, and Providence, which President Stob denies to Stoicism, may be found in Plato. Plato's conception of God would be a subject for a lengthy monograph. Here we can touch on only a few essential points. The God2 of Plato is in essence far more akin to the God of Christianity than to the God of the Stoics. There are those who make Plato identify God with the Idea of Good. This, as Professor Shorey has pointed out,3 is not justified by the text of Plato. Like the Chris- tians, Plato took his conception of God from the traditional re- ligion of his people, only purifying it of all unworthy and immoral 2 Or gods-Plato uses sometimes the singular, sometimes the plural, with little dis- crimination. He followed common usage in employing the plural, but his own concep- tion was certainly monotheistic. 3 Plato, Republic (L.C.L.), II, Introd., p. xxv, and I, 183, note.</page><page sequence="3">472 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL anthropomorphism. To him God is essentially good4 and the cause of all good things. From him comes no evil. Evil attends upon mortal nature and this present world, whence we must attempt to flee by becoming as like to God as we can.5 God, he maintains, is unchangeable.6 With Him "is no variableness, neither shadow of turning,"'7 but He is the same yesterday and today and forever.8 He is true and cannot lie.9 Plato does not say anywhere in so many words that God is a spirit, but the whole tenor of his works affirms it and it is implicit in many passages. In the tenth book of the Laws, after he has proved to his own satisfaction the primacy of spirit and its su- periority over matter,10 he says, "This soul [i.e., that which guides the sun and stars] we must consider (a) god," and again, "Since soul or souls appeared to be the cause of all these things.. . we shall affirm them to be gods. . . ."11 Later,12 it is true, he says that our soul and body are indestructible, though not eternal, like the gods of tradition (oi Kara vb6ov 'rEcs OEol). But he is here evidently contrasting the traditional conception of God with his own, which he sets forth in that book and to which we shall return later. And in the Phaedrus he says as explicitly as his caution permits, "God, as an immortal being, possessed of both body and soul, conjoined forever, is something we fashion without ever having seen it or adequately conceived it. But let that be as God pleases."'3 It is undoubtedly true that no Greek philosopher had quite so personal a conception of God as did the early Christians. The reason is plain. Early Hebrew religion, like early Greek religion, was anthropomorphic. In spite of the fact that the sacred scrip- tures of the Hebrews repeat that God is not as man, yet they endow him with many human attributes. Even the greater proph- ets who like Plato, sought to make religion ethical and spiritual, are compelled to "speak with the vulgar." It is extremely difficult for the average human mind to conceive of things that transcend 4 Cf. Rep 379 E; Tim. 29 E. 5 Cf. Theaet. 176 A-B. s Cf. Rep. 380-81. 7 James i, 17. s Cf. Hebr. xiii, 8.

Witness the conversation of Jesus with Nico- demus.14 Taking away anthropomorphism frequently means taking away personality from the Deity. The early Christians escaped this dilemma because to them "God was in Christ." He was God in human form, "the express image of his person."'" But who shall say that great minds in all ages have not suc- ceeded in establishing a deep personal relation with a being wholly spiritual? Such were the writers of the fortieth chapter of Isaiah and of the twenty-third Psalm; such was the Jesus of the Gospels; such were the nobler mystics from St. Francis to Madame Guyon; and such, it seems, was Plato, or the Platonic Socrates. In the Phaedo he speaks of the gods as our guardians (wLrutEXov_4.vovs) and masters and is certain that he will be in their care even after death.1" In the Republic he frequently speaks of the good man as dear to, or the friend of, God."7 If God is described as good, true, unchanging, just, holy, wise, and as the friend and protector of men who seek to pattern themselves according to his likeness, we shall probably be safe in saying that Plato attributes personality to God. Let us see if Plato is less akin to Christianity in his opinion of the nature of man. In the Phaedrus Socrates says he endeavors to know himself, whether he is a beast more complex than Typhon or a gentler, simpler creature, partaking of the grace of God.'8 Matthew Arnold is a little careless in his quotation of this passage. Plato had no illusions concerning the actual state of human nature. He knew that the many-headed beast is with difficulty kept under by the man, or rather by the divine element in man (0oEL Us rE Kal OEOEKEXoP) and that if the lower nature is conquered it is OGaE loupm.n9 He could well understand St. Paul's, "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."

He has a desire to depart and to be with God, and he looks upon the body as a prison from which he would fain be released, finally by death, and mean- while by philosophy which scorns earthly things, and his soul would not again be entangled with the yoke of bondage to pleas- ures and pains after philosophy has made it free.21 In both the Republic and the Laws Plato is pessimistic concern- ing human nature, though in the earlier work he dreams of an ideal city of God among men, whose citizens shall be virtuous not merely 4i puotipa but by proper training. But this city finally takes refuge in heaven;22 and he tells us later that no human affairs are worthy of great concern.23 In the Laws he repeats this sentiment, adding that God alone is worthy of all serious concern.4 Man is at best a plaything of God, his puppet,25 his possession.26 The most that men can do is to worship and sing and play and dance and rejoice before God, being for the most part his puppets but possess- ing some little share of truth.27 And when the interlocutor objects that the Athenian, who represents Plato, is belittling the human race, he replies, "Wonder not, but pardon me, for I was looking upon God when I said this. But, if you wish, let our race be not worthless but deserving of some concern." The Stoics took the conception of Providence from Plato, who was the first Greek writer to deal with it; and this he did in a way that quite equals its treatment in the New Testament. If Paul says, "All things work together for good to them that love God," Plato says, "If a righteous man is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming ill, we must believe that this will issue in good for him whether he live or die."28 If Peter says, "Who is he that will 20 Rom. vii, 22-23: Ka(rT T6v 6fw0 iav9pwrov.

Plato says, "You shall suffer nothing dreadful if you are truly noble and good and practice virtue.""29 But the great sermon on Providence is the tenth book of the Laws. Here Plato definitely rejects the notion that the gods do not concern themselves with small matters.-" The gods are good; they know all and see all, and they are in charge of the affairs of this world. No good physician or pilot or general or the like neglects the details of his craft. Such neglect would be the result of laziness or ignorance, which we must surely not attribute to the gods. God, who has charge of everything, has ordered all things for the safety and perfection of the whole. And we, too, however infinitesimal, have our part in it. We exist for the sake of the whole, not it for our sake. In other words, God has a plan for the world, which includes a plan for all beings in it, and he, the great draughts player, moves us into our proper places. But Plato does not accept an enervating determinism. He feels with Tenny- son, "Our wills are ours to make them thine." The consequences of our actions are fixed, but the degree of good or evil that our souls admit depends on our own will,31 and as we grow better we are moved up, as we grow worse, down, whether in life or in death. And we shall never be neglected by God's justice though we dive into the depths of the earth or soar up to the heavens.32 If the prosperity of the wicked troubles us, it is because we do not see how they contribute to the whole. Such is Plato's vindication of the ways of Providence. There is no uncertainty about his faith in the immortality of the soul. If Socrates in the Apology leaves the question open and in the Menexenus33 voices the wistful Si quicquam mutis gratum acceptumve sepulcris, which even the Christian faith of Tennyson cannot suppress,34 yet the whole of the Phaedo, the tenth book of the Republic, and numerous passages in the Laws permit no doubt of the matter.3" Plato is not quite so dogmatic on the subject as St. Paul.36 He does not make this belief the corner stone of his 29 1 Pet. iii, 13; cf.

To the somewhat unfortunate saying of Paul, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable,""7 he opposes the statement that the most righteous man is the happiest, and the most evil is most unhappy, alike whether their character is known to all men or gods or is not known.38 But that is simply a matter of difference in temperament and in method between the two. Much that is extravagant has been written on the subject of Plato and Christianity. It will not do to read into either one all the doctrines of the other, as mistaken zeal has frequently at- tempted to do-even good Bishop Berkeley in the eighteenth cen- tury still crediting Plato with an anticipation of the doctrine of the Trinity--but nevertheless Faguet is pretty nearly right when he says, On peut presque dire que dans la penste de l'humanitM le platonisme et le chris- tianisme ont Wtd et sont destines rester insiparables. 9 7 I Cor. xv, 19. $8 PI., Rep. 580 C; cf. 612 B-C. 39 Faguet, Pour qu'on lise Platon, 392.</page></plain_text>
