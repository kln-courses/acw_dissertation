<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tanaka Atsuko's Electric Dress and the Circuits of Subjectivity Namiko Kunimoto Following the end of the American occupation in 1952, art in Japan was at a crossroads. How would Japanese art compete on the international stage? Would Tokyo remain the strong- hold of the contemporary art scene? Given that women held the right to vote since 1946, would the postwar period usher in a change in status for women? This was contentious terrain for art making. Rather than heralding a period of overwhelm- ing Western influence in the arts or an abandonment of national concerns for a new devotion to transnationalism, this moment was fraught and uncertain, challenging and stimulating. With the unprecedented changes occurring in postwar Japanese cities and the réévaluation of gender roles occurring at the time, it was as though one's very sense of self was being destabilized and reimagined. For Tanaka Atsuko (1932-2005), her ambition to become an important avant- garde artist from Osaka in the early 1950s called for her to chart a challenging course: to restructure her sense of place in the world, through art and for art. Tanaka used her creative drive to interrogate the interrelations between gen- der subjectivity, artistic status, and representation. From Tanaka' s first days as a member of the short-lived group Zero-kai, followed by her ten-year involvement with the Gutai Art Association (a group of artists working together in the Kansai area of Japan from 1954 to 1972), her work has stood apart.1 She garnered acclaim for her performance works, particularly for Electric Dress, a piece made of lightbulbs that Tanaka first made and wore in 1956 (Fig. 1). Reviewers, as well as the Gutai group's leader, Yoshihara Jirõ, lauded her paintings.2 Over the last decade, international recognition of her vivid acrylic paintings and groundbreaking 1950s perfor- mance art has skyrocketed. Tanaka' s first solo exhibition in North America, Electrifying Art, was held in 2004-5, and since that time* her work has been featured in the Elles exhibition (Paris, 2010, and Seattle, 2012) and Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, in 2007. Most recently, the first large-scale retro- spective, Tanaka Atsuko : The Art of Connecting, was held at Birmingham's Ikon Gallery (2011), Espai d'Art Contempo- rani de Castello (2011), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (2012). In February 2013 the Solomon R. Gug- genheim Museum, New York, highlighted her work in the first North American retrospective on the Gutai Art Associa- tion. International demand for Tanaka' s work has never been higher. Yet a deeper understanding of her oeuvre requires a fuller reconsideration of its connections to the social context of 1950s Japan than it has thus far received. Tanaka was a twenty-year-old artist in Osaka in 1952 when the American occupation of Japan came to a close. Within a few short years, destabilizing changes took place in the artist's hometown: a marked growth in population density created by transportation upgrades, a sudden increase in the commer- cialization of women's bodies in the media, unprecedented industrial development, and a surge of productivity in the arts. The average amount of private living space per person in the city dramatically decreased.3 What effects would this un- settled environment have on one's sense of self? Tanaka painted with vibrant vinyl colors and produced mesmerizing entanglements of circles and wiry lines that are distinct from the action-based gestural works of other Gutai members like Shiraga Kazuo, Shimamoto Shõzõ, and Mura- kami Saburõ. The important Gutai scholar Katõ Mizuho has played a msýor role in drawing attention to Tanaka's solo career. Katõ curated Tanaka's first retrospective show, Atsuko Tanaka: Search for an Unknown Aesthetic , 1954-2000 in 2001 and also co-curated Electrifying Art (1954-1968) with Ming Tiampo in 2005. In the former exhibition's catalog, Katõ argues convincingly that Tanaka searches for boundaries in her work. The artist's interest in boundaries and the body, according to Katõ, "was of an entirely different nature from Challenging Mudby Shiraga, or Breaking through Many Screens of Paper by Murakami, as she sublimated the materiality of the work instead of bringing it to the fore."4 Katõ concludes that physicality has a role to play in Tanaka's art, "yet rather than being elucidated directly by spontaneous and dramatic ges- tures, the relation to the body emerges symbolically from the animated surface with its appeal to the sense of touch and visible surface of the body."5 Still, it remains unclear what may have motivated Tanaka's interest in boundaries and surface materiality. English-speaking scholars have widely interpreted the Gutai Art Association (and postwar Japanese art in general) as an embrace of American-style democracy and individual- ism.6 True enough, some artists were indeed invested in expressions of individualism. However, assuming that all art- ists shared political ideals and a common sense of selfhood leads us to overlook important divergences in artistic identity and social anxieties of the time. The recourse to individual- ism as an explanation of artistic practice proves problematic. Rather than an articulation of individualism emerging from a fixed sense of self, Tanaka's work can be viewed as expressing the frailty of subjectivity. This inconstancy of self is revealed when considering performance pieces like Electric Dress and Stage Clothes in relation to the artist's extensive painted map- pings of circles and lines. Tanaka's art investigates the insta- bility of female subjectivity in light of urbanization through the materiality of surface. Without question, Tanaka's 1956 performance piece Elec- tric Dress has become the most celebrated of her works.7 The early performance piece owed its captivating quality in no small measure to the tension it generated between the sphere of cyborg spectacle and the vulnerable female body. Electric Dress is roughly the height of the average human body and covers the wearer from head to toe. Widely circulated pho- tographs of the piece, few that there are, show Tanaka's barely visible but recognizable visage peering out from be-</page><page sequence="2">466 ART bulletin September 2013 volume xcv number 3 1 Tanaka Atsuko wearing Electric Dress at the Second Gutai Art Exhibition, , October 1956, Ohara Kaikan, Tokyo, enamel paint on lightbulbs, electric cords, and control console, 65 X 31 V2 X 311/2 in.

As is evident from the full-length photograph (Fig. 1), her legs were completely covered by spiraling wires resembling an overgrown vine. Only her impassive expression and portions of her hands were visible. The work's nearly two hundred hand-painted bulbs, covered in synthetic resin enamel paints, resulted in an exceptionally heavy contraption, especially given the density of 1950s industrial materials - some have estimated its weight at more than 110 pounds, or 50 kilograms.9 To help offset the weight, Tanaka wore the piece as it was suspended from the ceiling. Tanaka first wore the dress at the Gutai' s 1956 Tokyo debut at Ohara Kaikan in the Second Gutai Art Exhibition (Fig. 3). She positioned herself strategically before a wall of her paintings and drawings displaying plans for Electric Dress - a testament to her interest in the relational development between three- dimensional and two-dimensional art forms. For the Gutai Art on the Stage show in 1957 at Sankei Kaikan in Osaka, she performed Stage Clothes. In this performance, fellow Gutai member Shiraga Kazuo, Satõ Seichi, and Toyoshima Takashi 2 Tanaka wearing Electric Dress , detail, Second Gutai Art Exhibition , October 1956, Ohara Kaikan (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Art Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) wore costumes made of colored flashing bulbs. Unlike the version worn by Tanaka, these were not suspended from the ceiling and were not given titles; instead, they acted as a theatrical segue from Tanaka' s Stage Clothes . For the Third Gutai Art Exhibition at the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in 1957, the piece was displayed and not worn. In 1958, for the Second Gutai Art on the Stage at Asahi Kaikan, Osaka, Tanaka directed and performed an untitled piece featuring an electric dress and illuminated disks. The multiple iterations of Electric Dress - as a performance piece worn by the artist, as a piece worn by male performers, as an unworn installation, as a reconstruction, and, as it is most widely seen, as a photographic record of Tanaka's per- formance - makes defining and assessing the piece challeng- ing. Because Tanaka prefigured the work in drawings and later reused the bulbs to create tableau art that hung on the wall akin to a painting, even pinning down the start or end point of the work is problematic. Lacking a stable reference point, Electric Dress thus leads to confusion, a result that Tanaka likely courted. The often overlooked fact that men, too, once wore ver- sions of the piece raises complicated questions for analysis. If men and women both wore it, is gender therefore irrelevant to the piece? While the work may have resonated differently with male or female actors, it was conceived and devised in a particular time and place. How might have Tanaka's gen- dered experiences in postwar Japan informed her creative motivations? Tanaka, to be clear, was no feminist. She balked at the term, as perhaps most artists of her generation would.10 In any case, feminism is an issue different from the role gender played in her political, personal, and creative experi- ences. Electric Dress emphasized the ability of industrial force to</page><page sequence="3">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 407 3 Tanaka wearing Electric Dress , standing in front of drawings after Electric Dress , Second Gutai Art Exhibition , October 1956, Ohara Kaikan (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Art Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) overwhelm the senses. Powered by an electric circuit co- developed by Tanaka and an electrician she befriended, the dress flashed sequentially and the velocity of the signals in- creased until reaching levels that Tanaka called "incessant and chaotic."11 The adornment of the physical form caused a barrage on the senses of the wearer - the incandescent brightness of Electric Dress hazing or blinding vision, its mass limiting mobility, its sound impeding hearing, its heat impair- ing touch, its immensity overwhelming. Viewers, to a lesser extent, were also vulnerable to the work's effects: it was a noisy and heat-producing contraption that could not go un- noticed.12 The piece drew attention not least because it appeared at some of the first performance art shows seen inside or out- side Japan. The apparatus drew the eye, yet at the same time, its enclosure effectively blocked access to the performer. The contraption both illuminated and concealed the subject, with flashing lights that heightened the tension between access and denial. Unlike the works of other Gutai members who boldly claimed their individualism through destructive spec- tacle, Tanaka's spectral subject was partially exposed, partially hidden. A composite of machine and body, Electric Dress suggested only an unfamiliar, incomplete subject. Subjectivity (Shutaisei) and the Postwar Period Following Japan's defeat in World War II, imperialist rhetoric that fostered commitment to the nation over the individual was roundly rejected, and a réévaluation of subjectivity car- ried great philosophical currency.13 The notion of shared experience, perception, and interpretation among members of a nation was brought into question. New theories of sub- jectivity were often divergent, contradictory, and ambiguous. Yet academics and art critics have consistently employed the concept of "individualism" as having critical purchase on postwar artists such as those in the Gutai Art Association. Arguments promoting Japan's postwar embrace of individ- ualism also falsely frame intellectual development in Japan. How can we be sure that the nationalist messages of priori- tizing community over the individual were thoroughly inter- nalized before 1945? How can we determine that a clear notion of individualism emerged only after the war? The abrupt shift from imperialism to constitutional democracy, produced largely by the American occupation forces, no doubt altered the relation between the individual and the state. But we cannot assume that subjectivity before the post- war period was underdeveloped or entirely group-based. This misconception may be fueled by deeper assumptions that individualism is an American trait helpfully introduced to Japan by the occupation forces.14 James A. Fujii discusses Japan since the Meiji period, underscoring how notions of the self are often problematically assigned by nationality: In Japan, a nation persistently and misleadingly character- ized by foreigners and Japanese alike as a society where</page><page sequence="4">468 ART bulletin September 2013 volume xcv number 3 "group" (family) displaces "self," Western (particularly ro- mantic) conceptions of the individual continue to be em- braced with considerable fanfare. Naturalized by over a century of sustained rumination, individualism has been adopted as a powerfully attractive ideal, whether it finds popular expressions as an insistent and revealing emphasis on kosá (individuality) or when it appears repeatedly as the subject of scholarly discourse.15 The conclusion that Gutai art speaks to a newborn sense of individualism overlooks the fact that this notion has largely been constructed by academics in the postwar period. In reality, struggles for expressing a sense of artistic self certainly predate the 1950s.16 Tanaka's ambivalent relation to individualism further dis- tinguishes her from Gutai colleagues, such as Shiraga Kazuo, whose quest for individualism was made explicit in his writ- ings and art.17 Although Tanaka discussed her own work, talent, and the search for originality, her comments veered away from notions of the individual. In fact, she expressed a sense of distance from her art. In 1963, Tanaka wrote: It feels strange to look at a work that is well done. If the work in question is mine, I wonder how on earth I could have made it. Then, I want to make something again. However, if I am too absorbed with its surface and fail to understand the underlying idea, what I create is no good. If I am hesitant, it disappears, like a liquefying lump of sugar.18 Rather than mounting a campaign for the new and modern individual, her art reveals a lack of fixity in the subject, a sense of uncertainty about the strength and physical presence of self. For Tanaka, selfhood was not a consummate form, with art as its vehicle for expression, but rather a set of chance circumstances. Subjective identification was circuitous, expe- rienced through connection, disconnection, and repetition. Throughout her career, Tanaka was based in the Kansai region: first in Osaka and then the remote area of Asuka, Nara. Rarely traveling, Tanaka chose to remain in Japan even while many of her pieces were shipped abroad. Thus, Tana- ka's connections to the outside world were negotiated through paintings and performance art. For Tanaka, art was a means to examine agency and apprehensions about contact with the outside world.. Her status as a minority woman artist was not declarative but trepid and cautious. Whereas Yoshi- hara persistently demanded originality as a means to declare Gutai' s artistic autonomy to the international world, Tanaka used surface to negotiate and question her sense of self far from the center of the art world. Transportation and Urban Change Movement was a source of thrill and anxiety for Tanaka and her husband, Kanayama Akira (both were members of Zero- kai and Gutai and married in 1965 when they left the Gutai group). Jinno Kimio reports that Kanayama and Tanaka of- ten enjoyed taking drives in their speedy cars, with Kanayama at the wheel. Tanaka did not have a license, making it all too ironic that she died after being hospitalized following a seri- ous car accident.19 It is possible that Kanayama was more taken with the thrill of speed, while kinetic energy in general attracted Tanaka; the train was her self-professed muse. She has said that most of her ideas came to her while on the train or near Osaka station.20 Trains were a marker of the intense changes in Tanaka's hometown. Following the American occupation, rapid trans- formations in Japan occurred at a number of different levels, including changes to urban geography, population, and transportation. In Osaka, a major industrial hub, these na- tional changes were magnified. This period was as crucial to Tanaka's artistic development as it was for the development of the city as a whole. Despite its high population, Osaka often received less cultural and governmental attention, a reality that posed greater challenges to an artist from the area in terms of grants, venues, and publicity. The changes to the municipality brought a growing awareness that resources and attention were routinely accorded to Tokyo and Kyoto. Crit- ics were attuned to the notion that industry dominated Osaka at the expense of cultural production. Writing in 1965, Jules Langsner noted: On first acquaintance, Osaka appears to be a most unlikely city for the emergence of a creatively vital, exuberantly non-conformist development in the twentieth century art. The business of Osaka is business. . . . With a population of over 3,000,000, Osaka is without a single gallery of signif- icances [s¿c] other than the Gutai Pinacotheca.21 Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that there is not one art critic of national stature in the town, leaving Gutai on the fringe of attention in the art press of the country.22 From the outset, Tanaka's art took up a modernity that was tethered to its roots in Osaka and the Kansai region. Art in Osaka was outside Tokyo's sway over Japan's contemporary art scene. The second most populous city in Japan, Osaka experienced rapid industrialization and immigration in the 1950s. The city developed faster during this period than even Tokyo and cemented its position as a major industrial center. Migrant laborers and Zainichi Koreans (permanent ethnic residents of Japan) became the city's biggest social groups.23 Many of these workers were forced to live in the city's low- income peripheral districts, and the city was ill-equipped to handle the increased commuter population. In 1954, there were more than 1,500 illegally built homes on sites where land readjustment projects such as new roads and parks were scheduled.24 By 1955, the housing shortage was estimated at more than 60,000 units. Reporting on Osaka's population influx, Hasegawa Junichi notes, "From 1941, the standard of 3.65 jõ [about SV2 square feet (1.08 square meters), or one tatami mat, the measure for room size] fell to 3.04 in 1948, and to 2.9 in 1953."25 This increase in urban population density profoundly affected everyday life. Moreover, the day- time population trebled, resulting in packed train lines and chaotic traffic.26 In 1955, the year Tanaka displayed her first electric works, Osaka saw the highest population growth to date and a cresting tide of urban transformation.27 Despite its origins and its status as an emerging economic powerhouse, Osaka provided a sharp contrast to the Kansai region's more picturesque cities of Nara and Kyoto. The port city's garish industrialism denied it a reputation for beauty</page><page sequence="5">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 4ß9 and historical grandeur. People from Osaka are reputed to talk and walk faster than those in the rest of Japan and are notorious for their colloquialisms. Moving through the city can be a challenge, as it has none of the orderliness of Tokyo, the tourist-focused organization of Nara, or the cherished (and constructed) tranquillity of Kyoto. As late as 1998, Tana- ka's memory of Osaka was characterized by recollections of clattery train stations, which she juxtaposed with her quiet lifestyle after moving to Nara: I really liked the nature here, but even though I've lived here [Nara] a long time, Osaka is still my favorite place, I miss it. Particularly when I see Tsuruhashi ... I get very nostalgic. When I hear the noise of the loop line, I really miss it. I always took the train at Tsuruhashi station.28 In 1956, Japan was poised for a period of breakneck tech- nological and industrial development and was practically buzzing with mechanical momentum. Key to the impending series of transformations was the reestablishment of Japanese National Railways in 1949 by the United States General Head- quarters, which set into motion circuitries of movement across the nation at unprecedented speeds.29 Connections between Tokyo and Osaka were to form the primary trans- port arteries. By November 1956, the Tõkaidõ express was running on electricity, enabling a passenger to travel the approximately 250 miles in six hours and thirty minutes and paving the way for the next development in transportation: the shinkansen .30 First proposed in 1957, the shinkansen , or bullet train, was promoted throughout the 1950s and had its first run in 1964 on the Tõkaidõ line.31 Capable of enormous speeds and powered by the country's advancing technical specialization, Japan's train network and the shinkansen in particular were trenchant symbols of the nation's modernity that continue to absorb a great deal of statewide focus to- day.32 More important, the trains actively manufactured that mo- dernity through the rapid transport of objects and bodies. As Paul Virilio has suggested, the mechanisms of war construct a direct interest in speed that has brought about a complete remeasurement of human experience.33 Although intended to heal the great rural /urban divide, the introduction of high-speed transport in fact may have exacerbated the prob- lem, as it permitted longer commuting distances, and fami- lies increasingly began to live in different regions. The flashing lights and sense of disorder in Electric Dress offer a synecdoche of the hustle and bustle of the city, vividly evoking the transportation networks that were central to postwar urbanization and economic development. Even in its earliest versions, the haphazárdly grouped lights had an un- ruly effect that negated their decorative aspect and empha- sized how media could overwhelm the subject-wearer. Tanaka herself was a child of Japan's industrial age: she was the youngest of nine children, supported by a father who worked in a match manufacturing plant. For Tanaka, the train stations of her hometown were always a prime fixation. In 1993, reflecting on her initial interest in Electric Dress , she said: For a long time I tried to come up with an interesting idea. After half a year or so, I was seated on a bench at the Osaka 4 Kanayama Akira, Work ( Railway Crossing Light), 1956.

This was it! I would make a neon dress!34 Like a traffic signal, the flashing colors command the viewer to stop and look. One can almost imagine the pulsating sensation that mesmerized the young artist as she witnessed the visual effects of the city's rapid commercialization. The piece by Kanayama exhibited in 1956 at the Gutai Outdoor Art Exhibition meshes with Tanaka' s preoccupations. In this conceptual work, Kanayama simply placed a railway- crossing signal inside Ashiya Park, juxtaposing the bold metal form with the greenery (Fig. 4) . It seems that the burgeoning transportation system was a source of inspiration and angst for both Kanayama and Tanaka. The rhythm of the bell on Kanayama' s "borrowed" railway-crossing signal coincided with that of the electric light in Tanaka's installation in the same venue, Stage Clothes , bespeaking their mutual interest in urbanization and each other (Fig. 5). Fujii has shown how trains further emerged as a space for cultural production in the Kansai area with the development of the Hankyu Railway after the turn of the century: If Marx was right in seeing the transfer of goods from the worker's shop to the market as a process of commodifica-</page><page sequence="6">470 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 3 5 Tanaka, Stage Clothes , installation view, Ashiya Park, 1956, enamel paint on lightbulbs, electric cords, plywood, vinyl sheets, motor, gears, and pulleys, seven objects, each 14 ft. 3% in.

Technology devised for utilitarian ends also gives rise to new shapes and deformations of sensibility, pleasure, desire, and fetishism.35 One could presume that during the postwar population boom the train's transient zone of social contradiction and "intimate alienation" of fashion, secretive gazes, and an in- creasing paucity of personal space would intensify to the point of subconscious and conscious disturbance. Signifi- cantly, Tanaka, in her performance pieces, covers herself with "made in Japan" exports of cloth and cheap industrial lights, drawing attention to capitalist evaluative systems that can treat bodies and products equally. Tanaka's work emerges from this "fragmentation of young women into their body parts and their fantastic recreation tellingly speaks to the logic of commodity production."36 Fujii's remarks reveal the train as a site of "disconnected encounter" crucial to subject formation in postwar Japan. It was in this heady atmosphere of speed and dislocation, when vast electric cir- cuits were laid across Japan, that Tanaka turned to wire her own works. Wires and the connections and disconnections of circuitry are perhaps the most common element of Tanaka's work. They materialize in the sequence of cords in Work (Bell), one of the first sound pieces ever made (Fig. 6) .s7 Circuits were also predominant in the wires in Electric Dress , and even in the threaded connections that linked each costume in the per- formance of Stage Clothes (1956). Most evident are the series of wiry lines in her paintings that followed Electric Dress , made from vivid acrylic and vinyl paint. Viewed in relation to her performance work, Tanaka's circuitries appear to enact a negotiation with the geography of the ever-changing city and state; moreover, they are symptomatic of the hazardous po- sition of the subject within that uncertain frame. The repet- itive presence of line and circle speaks to the tension between limits and limitlessness. Kusama Yayoi, born but three years before Tanaka, seems to share an interest in issues of finitude and endlessness. Yet Kusama's circles, at times in the form of mirrors, give back a reflection of the artist, either literally or metaphorically, in a way that Tanaka's work does not. For Tanaka, art offers no reassuring self-reflection. In its emergence in a time of elevated confusion and anxiety, Electric Dress is like a double-sided skin. On the one hand, it shines like the alluring city, spectacularizing the mundane and utilitarian lights and Tanaka herself. On the other, it is a luminous shield that keeps the outside at bay. Inviting as the vividness of the dress may be, its incandes- cence refutes touch. The glow and reflection of the lights enact movement, but the weight of the piece restricts bodily action. Tanaka's art experiment set the subject within a spe- cifically 1950s technology that was physical and spatial, unlike the work of later artists such as Eva Hesse, who took up similar formal interests in wiry connections. It can be said, then, that Electric Dress activates surface as a means to explore subjectivity as a nexus between inside and outside, negotiat- ing how the new technologies of postwar Osaka might be tested in the realm of performance art and representation, as well as on the body. Electric Dress is in a constant referential relationship to the body. When exhibited as an installation, the unfilled void at the center of the piece refers to its subject-creator, playing on the tension between the totality of the worn dress and the void of partiality it constructs (Fig. 7).38 Without electricity, there is a deadened sense to the work overall, as it hangs in empty stasis. Illuminated, the individualized glowing forms of the bulbs give way to a unified shape, and the shining figure is brought to the fore. Hence, Tanaka's choice to have the lights blink on and off enacts the oscillation between part and whole; furthermore, it suggests that whole- ness is ultimately an illusion brought about by the activation of segments.</page><page sequence="7">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 47ļ 6 Tanaka installing Work (Bell) at the Third Genbi Exhibition , November 1955, Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art, 20 bells, electric cords, control console, switch (photograph © Ryoji Ito) Mapping the Senses Tanaka's diverse oeuvre points to a strong interest in sensory experience. Bell , for example, worked with sound; Work (Yel- low Cloth ) (Fig. 8) was inviting to the touch; and Electric Dress transfixed viewers and evoked the melding of skin and ma- chine. Bell, a startling piece that has not received its due attention, was originally installed in 1955 and reconstructed in 1985, 2000, and 2004.39 It is an installation piece com- posed of a set of approximately twenty small bells of similar appearance placed at points roughly six and a half feet (two meters) apart around the floor of a gallery.40 The silver, circular orbs resting on their bases have a functional, non- decorative quality and are connected by a series of wires. A willing gallery visitor activates the piece through a single touch of a button. Each bell then sounds in sequence, and while all of the bells ring in an aggressive, high-pitched tone, each sound differs from the last, in a seemingly endless series of discordant tones that lasts about two minutes. It is a work that requires bodily action to be initiated and incurs bodily responses once sounded - if not the usual embarrassed and alarmed expression, a startled jump while covering one's ears, or at least an extreme vibration of the eardrum. 7 Tanaka looking at the Electric Dress at the Second Gutai Art Exhibition , October 1956, Ohara Kaikan (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Art Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) Key to BelF s effectiveness is the visitor's integration into the sensory experience. Tiampo aptly points to the significance of the interaction but characterizes the engagement as posi- tive: "Despite its irritating sound, interacting with the work is extremely pleasurable. First there is the thrill of transgres- sion - creating a racket in the quiet space of contemplation that is the art exhibition, as well as breaching the sacred rule, 'do not touch.' "41 Yet this so-called transgression is at the request of the gallery/ artist to the viewer, and, in fact, the ensuing prolonged, shrill din evokes at best a mixture of annoyance and displeasure. The piece is interesting because of this disj une ture, not despite it. Considering the code of behavior in the 1950s, it is likely that gallerygoers would have found their responsibility for the noise acutely embarrass- ing.42 Yoshihara commented that the work received severe criticism, adding that Tanaka's "dangerous projects often terrorized us."43 Bell's invitation and subsequent denial of pleasure indicate the risks in exposure to new media. Viewers disclaimed re- sponsibility after having pressed the button: "I didn't know it would do that!" "I don't know how to make it stop . . ."44 This common response intimates that rather than "breaking the boundary between art and life," as Tiampo states (thus mak- ing reference to Allan Kaprow's text on Happenings),45 Bell presents the possibilities but ultimately reaffirms the limits of our agency.

In the space of the sound intervals, viewers are faced with their own corporeality and the performative possibilities (as the security guards and other gallerygoers watch) within that frame.46 Electric Dress exploits a similar theme. It elevates the sensory experience of vision and physical contact through its context and production onstage. In contrast to Bell , there is no tan- gible point of contact with the work. Our eyes meet the surface of the dress, confounding material and light as one. Here an envisioned, imagined physicality, one that displaces Tanaka' s own presence, is the active site of contact. The repetitious flashing lights anchor the work in a system that is comforting in its recurrence and offputting in its heat and light. The work urges us to imagine our own immobility as we watch the lone figure that can make only small gestures from within her luminous costume. Likewise, the electric clothes render the body hidden and sexless. Watching Electric Dress , viewers have the opportunity to realize that it is we who sex the hidden subject, overly accustomed as we are to seeing the female body on display. To be sure, following the end of the occupation, the costumed woman's body took on a unique, overexposed visibility that is illuminating in terms of under- standing this work. Gender and Visual Culture Commercial visual culture and gender were tightly inter- twined as Japan struggled to regain economic footing after the war. A wave of popularity for tailoring, fashion icons, and "dressing up" in the 1950s is evident in the visual culture of magazines, newspapers, and posters of the time. The pages of the Daily Yomiwri (Yomiuri Shinbun ), for example, show that advertisements for newly opened dress shops, cosmetic com- panies, and fashion guides appeared frequently in each sec- tion of the paper (Fig. 9) . Newjapan, these images promised, would be modern and captivating. Movie listings in the larg- est newspapers featured depictions of Marilyn Monroe with each film she released. Her figure is larger than figures in other advertisements on the page, her legs shown uncovered and extending over the boundaries of the illustrated mar- quee, as though this boldly fashioned star, in excess of size and allure, was enticing the Japanese reader to be complici t in the glamorous dream of sexualized capitalism (Fig. 10). Monroe's figure, promoting How to Marry a Millionaire , sits in competition with other ads for handmade Western-style dress patterns or discounts on kimonos. Magazines like Housewife's Companion ( Shufu no tomo) with articles on how to turn kimo- nos into dresses and new ways to apply cosmetics to make one's eyes appear larger, maintained high levels of popularity following the war.47 These newspaper images, directed to the middle class, suggest a postwar réévaluation of the moga , a 1930s neologism for "modern girl," who was characterized by short hair, makeup, and a new public identity. Moga were perceived as a threat to moral standards, and government regulations were used in an attempt to control the risk of their supposed brazen sexuality.48 In 1925, for example, Osaka authorities banned dancing in places serving food, limited service hours,</page><page sequence="9">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 473 10 Asahi Newspaper, March 3, 1954, showing an advertisement for a movie starring Marilyn Monroe and outlawed dim lighting as a means to control social mo- rality.49 During the war and the American occupation, the status of women underwent further changes. Following the approval of women's right to vote in 1946, the media and the market capitalized on the notion of women's empower- ment. Tanaka participated in this surge in self-fashioning. She also took up the highly gendered role of amateur seam- stress - an activity that informed her art practices, as Work (Yellow Cloth ) and Stage Clothes reveal.50 As the visibility of women's bodies used in advertising skyrocketed, Electric Dress offered an alternative visualization of the female body, one that neither collaborated with the commercialized female body nor affirmed it as empowered. Curator and scholar Tatehata Akira has dismissed Tanaka' s works as fashion play.51 But "fashion" for Tanaka was more than a consumerist trend; it was, for her, a verb: to fabricate, adjust, configure. She understood that the world of fashion was producing and responding to changes in the representation of the female body, corresponding to the influx of Western and Western- ized women on television, filmj and advertisements. Rather than seeking out fashionability, Tanaka instead exposed how it had become both cage and armor for the female form. We might reconsider her interest in clothing as a preoccu- pation with the materiality of surface: the point of contact between the body and the outside world. The surfaces of clothing, especially in the 1950s, were a site of gender differ- encing. Surface become an arena of distinction, presented in Tanaka' s work as alluring and available as a potential, if elusive, site of contact. After all, surface is the external face of an object, structuring interaction. Emmanuel Lévinas tells us that the face-to-face encounter is the irreducible relation that brings about our sense of subjectivity.52 Consequently, we might understand that surface for Tanaka is foundational yet always uncertain terrain, allowing the subject the opportunity to hide or withdraw. Françoise Levaillant has remarked on Tanaka' s use of sur- face in other terms. She maintains that Tanaka deliberately brought into question the traditional social relation between the feminine body and its envelopment.53 Levaillant, who has summarized the use of electricity by Gutai members in the 1950s, has argued that Tanaka's colleagues such as Yoshihara Michio and Sumi Yasuo employed electricity as a signal, in an expressive, gestural, masculinist manner, while Tanaka har- nessed the energy contained within the material, to give it its full plastic richness.54 Tanaka meant for us to see that the female body was simultaneously bound and displayed by visual media. Media was a further component of complicated postwar developments and often affected gender in specific ways. Sandra Buckley has noted how commercialism and images of women were intertwined: "Television advertising increasingly focused on a well-dressed (Western) and perfectly coiffured woman (also often Western or Japanese-American) standing in a spacious Western-style kitchen surrounded by state of the art appliances. Women were drawn into a relationship of desire with this technologized, Westernized, domestic inte- rior."55 To be sure, commercialized desire had emerged in previous decades, but in the 1950s it became more pro- nounced. Significantly, these representations were part of a contradictory order of gendering. Highly feminized models in magazines and newspapers circulated at a time when women increasingly found themselves in workplaces and in subject positions that had previously been reserved for men.56 Films, too, addressed the embattled terrain of gender and help shed light on the backdrop of Tanaka's budding career. Kurosawa Akira's film Throne of Blood, or Spider's Web Castle (Kumon no su-jõ , 1957), a reinterpretation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan, was produced the same year as Electric Dress. Throughout the film, Mifune Toshiro's character Washizu wears bright metallic armor that contrasts with the shadows surrounding him, the armor symbolizing the failure of the powerful masculine body against the psyche and the un- known. His armor provides a striking comparison to Tanaka's piece. The glittering regalia offer no defense as Washizu battles his inner demons of ambition, fear, and anxiety. His battle, too, is played out in a highly performative and theat- rical manner, framed through the glittering surface of met- aphoric armor. Similarly, physical threats take a back seat to cultural anx- ieties in Ozu Yasujiro's Tokyo Story ( Tokyo monogatari , 1953), where female characters represent the fraught position of the modern woman. In this film, the mother is a full-bodied matriarch, who lumbers slowly through quiet interiors, still carrying the psychological burden of losing her son in the war. When she passes away, her large body is laid out for the private wake held in the cramped living room, her physical presence a symbol for the motherland of Japan and the loss of tradition. The film also features the much-loved star Hara Setsuko, portraying the widowed wife of the dead son.

Not extant (photograph © Ryoji Ito, provided by Ashiya City Museum of Art and History) ing prim and resolute, renounces personal goals, social con- nections, and material values to protect the customs of the familial unit. In this film and many others, female morality and loyalty to the family are coded, not so subtly, as the rules of the game for women. It was in this context that Tanaka, one of a small minority of female artists in Japan, began her difficult career path. Tanaka and other female members of Gutai were given ample space in exhibitions and in the pages of the journal Gutai (a newsletter produced by the group from 1955 to 1965). 57 In this sense, and in many others, Gutai was ahead of the times. Yet there is no doubt that Tanaka' s artistic abilities were viewed through a gendered lens, both by critics and by those within the group. For instance, Gutai member Sta- niamo to Shõzõ said in 1955: "Among these few examples of avant-garde art, Tanaka' s work has taught me about an aes- thetic sensitivity that I did not have, especially an alternate possibility of rigorous beauty that can be created from wom- anly sweetness and frailty. They were a great influence on me."58 Both Kanayama and Yoshihara Jirõ expressed surprise that Tanaka was able to lift some of her larger installation pieces, or frequently contrasted the slightness of her figure with her work. In an exhibition brochure, Yoshihara described Tanaka as "an annoying person of violence who is . . . endowed with a tiny body that can be held in one hand. When she plans her works, she expects no assistance from others. But who can just watch from the sidelines?"59 Tanaka herself may have contributed to this image; in several photographs from the 1950s and 1960s she posed in a side angle, dwarfed by the artworks next to her (Fig. 7) . The power of visual scale and its complicated relation to gender was not lost on her. Contemporary reception of Tanaka' s art was likewise highly mediated by comments about the artist's gender. More than one reviewer posed her success as uncharacteristic of her sex, stating that her work was dynamic and "unwom- anly."60 In another example, the headline of a 1955 edition of the Asahi Newspaper ran: "Twenty Bells Take You by Surprise: A Young Lady's Work Accepted for Genbi's Exhibition with- out Problem."61 Nearly ten years later, the same patronizing tone can be detected in a headline reading, "Tanaka Atsuko: With her outlandish ideas, she is bold, despite her frail- looking physique."62 In the English edition of the Mainichi News , Tanaka is repeatedly referred to as "Miss Tanaka" - language that may have been axiomatic at the time but nonetheless signals difference; Yoshihara and other members of Gutai were simply referred to by their surnames.63 This overemphasis on her supposed frailty as well as the everyday challenges of sexism may have elicited a degree of resentment in Tanaka, a resentment that surfaced through her art. In an untitled work, she placed a neon-pink rayon material against the dirt, juxtaposing the saturated color with the unmanipulated ground (Fig. 11, reconstruction).64 De- scribing her aims in 1955, she said: I wanted to shatter a stable beauty with my work. In the case of the pink fabric the size of twenty tatami mats [about 32 feet 10 inches by 32 feet 10 inches], I wanted to use the most distasteful color imaginable. I walked all over the city of Osaka and finally found this rayon. I wanted to destroy the superficiality of the conventional "artist-look," using the weird sheen that resulted from sunlight reflect- ing from the cloth covering the ground.65 The vivid color - a nearly nauseating pink (an extremely difficult color to find or make at the time) - was chosen, Tanaka said, because it was the color she disliked the most. Nevertheless, the bald monochrome suggests more than the limits of taste. It registers how color alone can connote the gendered issues of artifice, makeup, dress up, and made-up frivolity - things that Tanaka may have responded to with ambivalence. Surely, her work had a comedic "lightness" to it,</page><page sequence="11">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 475 but it was a humor directed at the most serious and danger- ous matters. This approach has a long history in art, as Honoré Daumier and others have shown us. Too often, re- viewers of Gutai have caught on to the "fun" while missing the punch line of the joke - namely, that nothing short of wom- en's agency was at stake.66 Throughout her career, Tanaka's works took a timely interest in fabric and women's fashion that was charged with an undercurrent of disquieting ambi- guity. Stage Clothes In the filmed version of Stage Clothes , performed in Osaka in 1957 (Figs. 12-14), Tanaka concocted a direct response to the growing demand for commercialized beauty, inverting the sexiness of the striptease. The young artist appeared in a green organza dress, with one yellow sock and one green sock, her face expressionless. She then proceeded to take off the sleeves and midsection of the dress, revealing a yellow frock underneath that then was pulled off to expose a fuchsia chiffon gown. She removed her layers of costumes rapidly and matter-of-factly, each action disclosing another color and style of gown beneath the one before. Though the dresses were frilly, colorful, and generally ostentatious, her clipped movements and efficient manner maintained an insistently sober atmosphere. She did not smile. Movements superflu- ous to the removing of clothes were kept to a strict minimum. The mysterious way that each dress appeared, bringing into play trick sleeves and removable panels, made the per- formance look more like a magic show than a fashion show. Tanaka's performance offered no sexy strut down a catwalk, no embellished turns. No surprise, then, that the work fin- ished without a flourish. The artist simply stopped when she was wearing only a thick black leotard that rendered her form invisible against the dark stage. That decision was significant. This was a striptease of anticlimax, where the body was virtu- ally obscured in a black void. Stage Clothes constructed tension between the viewer's desire to see and know the contours that define the individual body or character and the ambiguous, sober performance of the artist. Tanaka's studies for Stage Clothes (about 1956) bear out a similar interest in transformation rather than individualiza- tion (Fig. 15). In each of the sketches, the figure is drawn in a series of lines across the page. Tanaka delineates the ways each piece of cloth will be worn or removed by using red watercolor to indicate the placement of the cloth on the subject. In the first plan, the repeated figure is a minimally detailed shape with legs; in the other two plans, she draws stick figures in succession; and in the third, the rudimentary figures appear with vague breasts and hips. Regardless of the state of dress, the subject in the drawings and in the perfor- mances remains expressionless, sexually neutral, and devoid of personal gesture. This refusal of the erotic stands in opposition to the ubiq- uitous availability of women's skin in the postwar period. Historian John Dower states that "the eroticization of de- feated Japan in the eyes of the conquerors took place almost immediately, creating a complex interplay of assumed mas- culine and feminine roles that has colored U.S.-Japan rela- tions ever since."67 Such a sexualization of the nation reaches even further back to Commodore Matthew Perry's alleged "opening" of Japan a century earlier. In the 1950s, the sexual tension between the occupation forces and Japanese citizens was no less problematic. It is well known that Japan forced women into sexual slavery to create so-called comfort stations for its soldiers in Japanese-occupied territories in World War II. That the government called on Japanese women to work in state-run brothels for American military men during the occupation has received less attention. The American Gen- eral Headquarters shut down these stations because of the resulting spread of sexually transmitted diseases. But erotic dance shows, prostitution, and compensated dating re- mained commonplace throughout the 1950s. The sexual commerce between American soldiers and Jap- anese women was so pervasive that children frequently played a game called panpan asobi , where they would pretend to be GIs and freelance prostitutes.68 Considering the alarming intensification of traffic in women's bodies, Stage Clothes hits a nerve. Rather than an exaltation of individual spirit, as some scholars have suggested, the performance piece bespeaks the anxiety over the status of Japanese women in the postwar period. Stage Clothes , in its attention to fashion as well as the relation between body and performance, reveals the con- structs of gender without reinventing the oft-seen icons of the moga (modern girls) or panpan girls. Like the majority of Tanaka's works, it explores the touch points between the physical self and the world.69 At the same time, the viewer's obscured vision and the performer's multiple transforma- tions evoke the impossibility of confidently securing any iden- tification with the performer. Tanaka's reiterative transfor- mations make it clear that she is performing; we do not come to know the artist as an individual but instead witness the appearance of self as a facade, in all its changing manifesta- tions. Ratõ clarifies how Tanaka's oeuvre diverges from that of the other Gutai members due to her preoccupation "not with the body in motion but with its everyday character" but stops short of relating surface to gendered subjectivity.70 Surface in Tanaka's work is presented as alluring and available as a potential site of contact akin to the sexual capital of the postwar period. Electric Dress , with the artist's small face framed within the lights or the captivating use of color and mechanics, invites speculation about who it is that would don such a dress. Yet just as the lights and colors draw us in, the heat and unwieldiness of the piece keep us at bay. As Judith Butler reminds us, surface and the boundaries of the body play a profound role in gender subjectivity: the "boundaries of the body are the lived experience of differentiation, where that differentiation is never neutral to the question of gender difference or the heterosexual matrix."71 The seemingly never-ending series of compositions Tanaka made after Electric Dress is a painterly means of finding the limits of self and other, of how equivalence and difference can be achieved by testing the relation of two basic elements (circle, line) on the thin arena of paint and canvas. Perhaps the most relevant boundary that Tanaka pursued is that of the space between personhood and media. She sought out the upper limits of heat, sound, luminosity, and size that the physical body can bear. Tanaka determined the interstices between the body and technology, revealing how our media-</page><page sequence="12">476 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 3 12 Tanaka performing Stage Clothes at Gutai Art on the Stage , May 29, 1957, Sankei Kaikan, Osaka (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Art Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) tized selves produce the gendered self in their expectations, juxtapositions, and dangers. Tanaka made compositional plans for Electric Dress and also drawings after Electric Dress that were exhibited in the back- ground of the 1956 exhibition at Ohara Kaikan, signaling the importance of the work to her creative trajectory (Figs. 16, 3). The drawings and paintings that followed the piece were based on its form, color, and patterning. While some of the drawings refer to the circuitry and others map the structure of the piece, most are focused on the "pattern" of the dress - the surface composed of lines and circles. (Tanaka made four hundred two-dimensional works, and all rely on this complex patterning.) Throughout her oeuvre circles may be traced within other circles and in varying degrees of proximity to each other, but other geometric forms are rarely repre- sented, and circles, circles, circles repeat - and yet do not repeat, for each composition is observably unique. The paint- ing *87H, for example, is at once abstract, geometric, and serial (Fig. 17). Vivid circular shapes (which consistently appear throughout her body of work) are connected, bounded, distorted, and layered over by meandering lines. In the top right, the bold circle is held in tension by the wave of lines that seem to suggest a leftward movement. The intensity of lines on the left begins to meld, and distinguishing each element becomes increasingly difficult. The work is com- pacted with thick wiry lines and dark black circles that lend it a mechanical aesthetic. Acrylic lacquer, which Tanaka used throughout her career, emphasizes the synthetic nature of the textured, painted surface.72 Many scholars have become interested in the question of Gutai' s painterliness, arguing that even their performance work was ultimately a means to investigate the nature of painting.73 This is likely true, but the argument implies that the value of Gutai performance works is only relative to the traditional genre of painting. Beyond an interest in the na- ture of medium, Tanaka's performance works and paintings ask us to consider larger questions about selfhood through an interrogation of surface. Her paintings after Electric Dress ask if surface is whole or formed by its accumulations of fractures. Obliquely, this line of visual inquiry may be bound to the confounding issue of the modern subject in Japan. Where the figure is absent, where perspective is overridden for expan- siveness, where tension between chaos and order is palpable, the solidity of self is replaced with the connections and disconnections of lines and circles. These paintings refer back to Electric Dress but sublate the three-dimensional quality of the work. Though reducing the fullness of the dress, eliminating its mass and the noise of its cranking gears, the paintings still preserve some aspects of the original through color and the form of line and circle. Electric Dress , too, was disassembled and reused in a painterly arrangement of bulbs that hung from a vinyl sheet set against the wall. As the movement and transformational quality of surface in Electric Dress became immobilized and circumscribed, one wonders if this spoke to Tanaka's sense of the suppressive snare of Osaka and the pressures on a young artist who faced conflicting demands of gender hierarchies and artistic status. Tanaka's move from making three-dimensional to predomi- nantly two-dimensional art can also be linked to the threat posed by technological advancement, wherein the possibility of physical contact with the human body is removed and replaced by the televised body, the commercially represented body, or the body-in-transport. Industrial development held the promise of progress and change, but often it revealed the risks of swift transformation. Tanaka's own life was marked by tensions between the decision to push herself beyond her limits or to remove herself from the pulsating arena of the city; ultimately, she chose (as her doctor and husband recommended) to with- draw from the pressures of urban life and reposition her artistic status. As the young woman attracted the limelight, the Gutai group as a whole was receiving less press, and this strained relations between the group's leader, Yoshihara Jirõ, and Tanaka.74 Some have proposed that Yoshihara became</page><page sequence="13">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 477 13 Tanaka performing Stage Clothes at Gutai Art on the Stage , May 29, 1957, Sankei Kaikan (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Art Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) 14 Tanaka performing Stage Clothes at Gutai Art on the Stage , May 29, 1957, Sankei Kaikan (photograph © Ryoji Ito and the former members of the Gutai Ar ť Association, provided by Museum of Osaka University, Osaka) envious of the younger artist's success.75 In 1965, with the pressures of her solo career and the tensions within the Gutai group mounting, she became mentally ill and received psy- chotherapy.76 Tanaka and Kanayama left Gutai. She contin- ued to pursue her solo career, with Kanayama looking after her and taking over administrative responsibilities for her exhibitions. He initiated the move to a detached house on the grounds of the Buddhist temple Myõhõ^i in Osaka. Both Tanaka' s doctor and Kanayama felt the move to the quiet of the temple surroundings would further facilitate her recov- ery. She worked at Myõhõ-ji and the second floor of her parents' house in Tennoji-ku, Osaka. In 1972, Tanaka and Kanayama moved to Nara, living cooperatively with another couple, Hiroshi and Yasuko Fukuzawa.77 Tanaka' s struggles with gender hierarchies, artistic status among her peers, the changing urban environment, and her own personal issues were all likely factors related to her institutionalization in 1965; the precise nature of her private challenges can never be known. It may be tempting to con- clude that Tanaka' s creativity was fueled (only) by her unique mental instabilities (an idea that is furthered through com- parisons to Kusama Yayoi, who has relied on an autobio- graphical, psychological narrative to attract attention to her work).78 But seeing Tanaka as a crazed (read: hysterical) female artist, whose genius stemmed from her exceptional mental state, does a disservice to her art. Rather than simply a direct expression of her innermost turmoil, Tanaka' s art had stakes in the broader issues of female selfhood as it emerged in the Kansai region of Japan. Her performances and paintings were a means of asking questions about the</page><page sequence="14">478 ART bulletin September 2013 volume xcv number 3 15 Tanaka, Studies for Stage Clothes , ca. 1956, ink, watercolor, and pencil on paper, 11% X 8% in. (29.5 X 22.1 cm). Private collection (photograph © Ryoji Ito) viability and vulnerability of the gendered self in postwar Japan. Her art expressed an aura of disquiet that was shared by many who faced great uncertainties about what it meant to be a young woman in postwar Japan. Statistics reveal an acute rise in depression and an upswing in drug abuse among this demographic in the mid-1950s, ultimately indicative of larger cracks in the system.79 The Female Subject on the Precipice While the new high-speed Tõkaidõ train line resulted in economic growth and access to jobs for a wider demographic, the headlines that celebrated its unremitting increases in velocity soon shifted focus. Alarming reports of young women committing suicide by jumping in front of trains increasingly took precedence in the newspapers, gruesomely literalizing the obliteration of bodies by industrialization.80 According to the World Health Organization, Japan had the highest sui- cide rate in the industrialized world, peaking at a rate of 24 per 100,000 people per year in 1956 - precisely the year that Electric Dress was made.81 Furthermore, those most likely to commit suicide were Tanaka' s peers, women between the ages of twenty and twenty-four.82 This was the only historical moment to date when female suicides exceeded that of male suicides. Japanese women were four times as likely to commit suicide than their American counterparts in 1955, and sui- cide was (and remains) the leading cause of death for women between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four.83 Tobikomijisatsu , meaning suicide by train, was very common at the time, and it is still the main cause of delayed trains. When a train is delayed due to suicide (a regular occurrence in Tokyo), public announcement systems broadcast a standard euphe- mistic statement: "there has been a 'human incident' [jinshin jiko ]." In the 1950s, moreover, the urban center with the highest suicide rate was Osaka.84 Tanaka, who had faced her own challenges with mental health and harbored a fascina- tion for train stations, may not have been aware of the statis- tical realities but could not have missed the heightened levels</page><page sequence="15">TANAKA ATSUKO ' S ELECTRIC DRESS 479 16 Tanaka, Drawing after Electric Dress , 1956, crayon on paper, 42 SA X 29% in. (108.6 X 76 cm). Private collection (photograph © Ryoji Ito) of mental instability felt by her peers. These apprehensions were reenacted and explored in Electric Dress. Viewing the most frequently published photograph of the performance of Electric Dress, one can sense Tanaka's tenuous mastery of the production; she occupied a central yet unsta- ble position (Fig. 2). The work presented a visual spectacle yet was somehow restrained in movement and difficult to see: it would have been eye-catching and blinding, drawing the viewer to try and home in on the artist-subject. The low-level perceptibility of the subject-wearer, like a whisper, marks his or her hidden import. In the act of looking, the viewer, too, is complicit in the performative construction. In the making and wearing of her "electric clothes," Tanaka risks her body's security through exposure to heat and electric wiring in the performance while at the same time literally illuminating her role as artist. If, as Butler states, the self is constituted through the reiterative performative actions of the body, Electric Dress reveals the performative power to obliterate the body, even when the performative is what constitutes the self that "wears" it.85 In Understanding Media , Marshall McLuhan sees art as something that helps us prepare for the coming changes in the outside world, an idea whose relevance in performance art has been further articulated by Anne Wagner.86 In her article "Performance, Video and the Rhetoric of Presence," she argues that video art, particularly in its formative stage, sought to examine and expose how "art's summoning of selfhood is compromised by what we might call a 'media</page><page sequence="16">480 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 3 17 Tanaka, ' 87H , 1987, acrylic lacquer on canvas, 76 V4 X 101% in.

"87 Wagner views early video art not as electronic narcissism but as a politicized engagement with media, show- ing that, as McLuhan maintains, video "is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action."88 Vito Acconci, Joan Jonas, and Peter Campus are mentioned as those artists, among others, who know about "narcosis and numbing, know how to induce them and know that the reality of the body and of its senses - the reality of personhood - are somehow at stake."89 Tanaka, likewise, was absorbed in the potentially destructive aspects of urban- ization in modern Japan. She described the first time she wore Electric Dress in 1955: When I was finished, I was uncomfortable with the elec- trical connections. Since somebody had to wear it, I cov- ered myself with vinyl and put the electric dress on. The moment Mr. Sannomiya said, "I am turning the electricity on," I had the fleeting thought: is this how a death-row inmate would feel?90 Tanaka's comment compellingly conveys that Electric Dress evokes the overwhelming aspects of technology - so ubiqui- tous in postwar Osaka - constructed through a visual inter- rogation of surface, and, in doing so, the work explores the interstices and limits of gender subjectivity. The double- edged nature of this performance piece is evident in the riotous color and spectacular language of the dress versus the explicit threat of its weight and heat - and the channeling of a current that is deadly when misused. While the early per- formance piece occupies a critical position in terms of Tana- ka's work, it has consequences beyond the scope of her personal artistic maturation. Her piece is revealing of self- exposure and self-destruction, issues that loomed large in the 1950s for young women in Osaka. Electric Dress displays gen- der subjectivity as unstable and uncertain rather than declar- atively individualistic. It suggests how developing one's sense of self is a process that is powerful and yet rife with risks, bearing out subjectivity as vulnerable to the effects of surface contact, reliant on bodily performance, and exposed to in- dustrialization, urbanization, and the encroachment of tech- nology into ever more corners of people's everyday lives.

Tanaka was a member of the Gutai Art Association from 1955 to 1965. She joined the group with Kanayama Akira, Shiraga Kazuo, and Mu- rakami Saburõ, who were originally members of the small art group Zero-kai. She left the Gutai group with Kanayama in 1965, and the two were married that year. She continued to produce art until her death. 2.

For other works that align Gutai with the ideology of democracy and individualism, see Natsu Oyobe, Human Subjectivity and Confrontation with Materials in Japa- nese Art: Yoshihara Jirõ and Early Years of the Gutai Art Association, 1947- 1958 (PhD diss., University of Michigan, 2005), 224; Justin Jesty, "Arts of Engagement: Art and Social Movements in Japan's Early Postwar" (PhD diss., University of Chicago, 2010); and Ming Tiampo, Gutai: De- centering Modernism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011). Ti- ampo specifically includes Tanaka in her argument for Gutai's individ- ualism in " 'Create What Has Never Been Done Before,' " Third Text 21, no. 6 (November 2007): 689-706. Charles Merewether refers to Gutai as embodying "An Aesthetics of Freedom," in Art, Anti-Art, Non-Art: Ex- perimentations in the Public Sphere in Postwar Japan, ed. Merewether and Rika Iezumi Hiro (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2007), 7-10. Hirai Shoichi's foundational work on Gutai also aligns the group with individualism; Hirai Shoichi, "Mr. Gutai: Yoshihara Jirõ," in Gutai: The Spirit of an Era, exh. cat. (Tokyo: National Art Center, 2012). 7. When the piece was first discussed by Yoshihara, it was referred to as "clothes created by lightbulbs," and then later came to be referred to as denkifuku, or Electric Dress. The English translation of the work's tide has been somewhat controversial in terms of gender issues. The first two characters of the title mean electricity or electric, and the last character, Juku. , simply means clothes, suggesting the plausible transla- tion Electric Clothes. Had Tanaka chosen to specify women's clothing, she might have called it denki dress ( denki doresu ) or denki one-piece (denki wanpisu), but these terms created with the katakana syllabary, used to transcribe foreign-language words, would have connoted West- ernism perhaps more than Tanaka may have wanted. Katõ argues that the piece should be translated as Electric Clothes. This interpretation would also correlate with the English titles of two of Tanaka' s early pieces, both named Stage Clothes, although they, too, could be trans- lated as Stage Dress. Tatehata Akira, however, points out that Tanaka was alive when the work was exhibited abroad as Electric Dress and therefore would have raised objections had she had any (interview with the author, October 2008, Osaka) . It should also be said that the de- bate might be overstated because "dress" can be a gender-neutral term; moreover, discussion centering on the best translation may be taking the place of deeper analysis of the meaning of the work itself. For more discussion, see Katõ Mizuho, "Tanaka Atsuko Spring 1966: How Electric Dress Became Two-Dņnensional/ Tanaka Atsuko Spring 1966: 'Denki Fuku' wa ikani heimen e henkan saretaka?" Philokalia, no. 29 (2012): 105-27. 8. Some of the bulbs were of colored glass; some were painted with enamel paint in nine colors: dark red, light red, dark green, light green, purple, dark blue, light blue, yellow, and orange.

There is no photographer documented for these works; how- ever, the photographs were likely taken by Gutai members. Kanbee Hanaya of the Ashiya Camera Club was contacted to photograph other events, such as the Gutai Outdoor Exhibition and some staged perfor- mances.

At a symposium at University of California at Los Angeles on February 8, 1998, Tanaka stated: "My works have nothing to do with poli- tics . . . neither do they have anything to do with gender. It doesn't matter whether I am a man or a woman." Okabe, Tanaka Atsuko mõhi- totsu no Gutai. Ming Tiampo argues that gender is nonetheless critical: "Despite Tanaka' s claims to the contrary, the insertion of her self into the field of representation makes gender analysis both inevitable and important."

Other Gutai members also describe the sound of the electric gearbox as very noisy. Gutai ten I, II, III, 44 n. 38. 13. According to Victor Koschmann, the terms shutaisei (subjectivity) and shukan (the subject) were in high circulation in the postwar period, in part originating from debates about Marxism led by the Communist Party. These debates were concerned with how historical development would be charted and how the social subject would be used in that model. However, subjectivity also circulated as a term for a notion of Japanese existentialism that was tied to a Kierkegaardian "leap of faith" or, alternatively, as an individualistic ethos that was based on the Prot- estant ethic. Koschmann, Revolution and Subjectivity in Postwar Japan (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 4. 14. For example, Maruyama Masao argued that authentic democracy relied on the development of a "modern personality" that was not possible under imperialism.

For example, see Shiraga Kazuo, "Kotai no kakurtitsu" [Establishment of the individual], Gutai 4 (1956): 6-7. The oft-quoted "Gutai Mani- festo," written in 1956 by Yoshihara Jirõ, the ambitious and powerful leader of the Gutai Art Association, has exerted a heavy influence on the reception of Gutai. The manifesto states that Gutai will "take leave of these piles of counterfeit objects on the altars, in the palaces, in the salons and the antique shops. . . . Lock these corpses into their tombs. Gutai art does not change the material but brings it to life. Gutai art does not falsify the material." Yoshihara, "Gutai Sengen" [Gutai mani- festo], Geijutsu Shinchõ [New Journal of Contemporary Art] 7, no. 12 (December 1956): 202-4. While much can be made of the manifesto's emphasis on materiality, the convenience of its pat theoretical formula- tions has become detrimental to understanding what mattered most to artists associated with the Gutai group. That the manifesto was written by Yoshihara alone for the art journal Geijutsu Shincho two years after the group had begun to work together has been largely ignored. Hirai Shoichi, Gutai te nanda? [What's Gutai?] (Kobe: Bijutsu Shuppan-sha, 2004), 87. As a consequence, the Gutai have been approached as a ho- mogeneous entity despite the fact that the group had a membership of more than twenty at any one time; moreover, membership shifted over the eighteen-year period through which they stayed together (alto- gether, approximately fifty-eight people participated in the group, with msyor shifts taking place at three distinct periods) . It is perhaps time to move away from the overreliance on the manifesto and the persistent view that Gutai was a collective of homogeneous interests. Gutai was an "association" rather than a collective, meaning that members were in- terested in sharing resources and working space, encouraging one an- other to produce something new, but not necessarily sharing intellec- tual stances, political viewpoints, or artistic outcomes. 18.

Langsner says that among all the works produced by</page><page sequence="18">482 ART bulletin September 2013 volume xcv number 3 members of Gutai, Tanaka's stand out as those that "persist longest in memory," but argues that Tanaka could just as readily be from Los An- geles, Milan, or New York. I believe that the specific regional context of Osaka is important to her work and affects the asymmetrical transna- tional relations in which her paintings circulated. Langsner should be credited for noting that Tanaka does not easily fit within the confines of Gutai's aesthetic. 23.

Ibid., 128. 37. Janet Koplos has also commented on Tanaka's use of circuits. How- ever, Koplos concludes that Tanaka is interested in connectedness in a Buddhist sense. I do not see any linkage between Tanaka's work and Buddhism. Moreover, I find her work often disrupts any sense of con- nection, thereby raising the issue of disconnection as much as connec- tion. All too often, English-speaking critics lean toward frameworks of analysis that emphasize Buddhism, Zen, or other traits that further characterize the work as Asian. Although Tanaka lived for some time on Buddhist temple grounds, there is no indication that she was other- wise strongly interested in Buddhism. Koplos, "Circuitries of Color," Art in America^, no. 10 (2005): 147. 38. Hayashi Michio interprets this notion of absence in Electric Dress as predicated on Tanaka's interest in painting: "the [dress] was and has been exhibited repetitively without the artist's body in numerous exhi- bitions, often together with preparatory drawings."

For more on Bell, see Katõ Mizuho, "Atsuko Tanaka's Paintings, as Seen through Work (Bell)," in Tanaka Atsuko: The Art of Connecting, 39- 47. 40. Reconstructions of Bell at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, show the bells placed on the floor near the wall of the gallery space rather than in the center of the floor. The original was made of 131V4 feet of cord, twenty bells, and a motor switch. According to Tanaka, Yoshihara, and Kanayama (all whom were involved in the installation), the bells rang from front to back and to front again. However, at Electrifying Art the bells rang only in one direction. Washida Meruro writes that "if the work is repro- duced with the terminals in a spiral configuration as indicated in the remaining studies and photograph, the sounds of the bells only move in one direction, with the bells ringing simultaneously at up to three locations." Meruro claims the engineer Tanana Shinji pointed out the impossibility of bells moving forward and reversing when he recon- structed the Bells in 2005 for the Possible Futures show at the NTT Inter- communication Center in Tokyo. See Washida Meruro, "Be-ru ni tsuite" [About (Bell) by Tanaka Atsuko], Kanazawa 21 seiki bijutsukan kenkyzi kiyõ [21st-century Kanazawa journal on contemporary art and culture] 4 (2007): 39-42. Original and reproductions used the same number of bells and duration of sound. 41. Tiampo and Katõ, "Electrifying Painting," in Electrifying Art, 68. 42. These are the kinds of visitor reactions I observed at the exhibition Electrifying Art when Bell was displayed in the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2005. Yoshihara also referred to this work as "violent," suggesting responses to the original piece were similar.

Work ( Yellow Cloth ) is easy to mistake as a ready-made; a closer look re- veals that Tanaka cut into each piece of fabric and then subtly glued them back together.

Tiampo links Tanaka's performance to a negation of the body that is grounded in traditional Japanese art forms, rather than a self-conscious exploration of the relation between the body and the external world: "These anthropomorphic forms completely deny a consciousness of the body, implying an otherworldly presence. As with Denkifuku, or Electric Dress of 1956 whose conception of clothing the body utterly negates the body enshrined within, Stage Costumes also evokes the costumes of Noh, Kabuki and Bunraku which are a' fundamental part of the structured kami asobi [spirit play] stage of the matsuri [festival] ."

Given that Tanaka's career was skyrocketing, and she was not only a woman but also junior to Yoshihara, this would not be sur- prising. Jinno Kimio, interview with the author, 2008.
