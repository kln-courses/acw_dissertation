<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ryan Hediger Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show: The Uses of Animals, Science, and Film Introduction When in undergraduate courses I have screened Grizzly Man , Werner Herzog's compelling film about Timothy Treadwell, many student responses tend to resemble those common in the culture at large. They believe Treadwell was insane. Several of the students, like commentators about Treadwell on the Internet and elsewhere, further suggest that he deserved to die for engaging in so foolhardy an undertaking as living with grizzly bears.1 This reception of Treadwell often turns upon ostensibly common sense ideas about what is or is not normal. The notion of putting one's body at risk, for instance, is often taken as crazy, though of course most of us do this daily in dif- ferent contexts, such as when driving on freeways. Or the idea of communicating with animals, naming them, especially expressing love for them- these all seem unusual and questionable, particularly when those animals are wild bears. However, imputations of abnor- mality in such cases often take much of their cultural power from how ideas of "normality" remain unspoken and implicit.2 In this way, discourse on normality behaves like other politicized discourses such as those of gender, (post)coloniality, nature, and so on. The con- ventionally powerful side of binaries such as culture/nature, human/ animal, or normal/abnormal often can remain invisible, cloaked in Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 19.1 (Winter 2012) doi: 10.1 093/isle/iss025 © The Author(s) 2012.

This essay raises some of those unspoken assumptions in the Treadwell case into view and into question. I argue that many con- demnations of Treadwell, while often appropriate in some sense, also commonly displace real questions about human species identity and about human conduct toward animals and the wild. Treadwell is therefore constructed as a scapegoat or a "freak" in a well-established routine of discrediting unusual or marginal figures and thereby sim- plifying complex issues. I show that most discussions of him rely greatly on their genre or medium for their truth value, making use of documentary, news story, and science to reinforce what is often simply assumed about the four deaths in the case (Treadwell, his companion Amie Huguenard, and two brown bears): the fatal madness of Treadwell's animal sympathy This essay revisits many of those genres and media- science, news, and particularly Herzog's film- and interprets what might be called their "posthuman" semi- otics, a form of more-than-human meaning-making. Posthuman semiotics complicate the human/nonhuman distinction in important ways that bear on our understanding of animal lives and on how we should read many kinds of texts. For instance, despite Herzog's nar- rative insistence on absolute difference between humans and bears, the footage he screens demonstrates compelling cross-species com- munication. His film therefore gestures toward the ongoing work to redefine language and meaning-making in animal studies, ecocriti- cism, and other fields. I do not argue here against the basic idea that Treadwell was unusual, nor do I follow some of his more ardent supporters in sup- posing that his physical imposition of himself into the lives of the coastal brown bears was an act of pure goodness. As we will see below, it seems clear even to many of us who sympathize with Treadwell that his time in Alaska was largely motivated by self- promotion and by a strong desire to make his own life meaningful. However, I argue that imbedded in his desire is some genuine insight about the conditions of postmodern, posthuman life. Moreover, the sane "truth" yielded in criticisms of Treadwell frequently proves ster- eotyped in much the way Rosemarie Garland Thomson insists that notions of disability often are. Her book Extraordinary Bodies , my source for the term "freak," includes analysis of the cultural work of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century "freak shows," where humans with unusual physiologies and some animals were displayed for the public. Thomson demonstrates that these shows reaffirmed</page><page sequence="3">84 ISLE prevalent and reductive notions of the normal body by presenting extreme counterpoints. In Treadwell's case, as in Thomson's analysis, the stereotype functions as a heuristic by which notions of stable normality can be reiterated. Thus, many analyses of Treadwell merely reinscribe precon- ceptions about science and animal sympathy and fail to attend adequately to the particulars of the case, to the documentary material per se, to the actual science of the issues, or to animals themselves. Yet a great deal is at stake in these responses to Treadwell, including our views of bears, animals, humans, and the nature of nature more generally. As has been well documented, scenarios involving animals, particularly the so-called charismatic megafauna, tend to distill and clarify otherwise obscure cultural attitudes about nature and environ- ment.3 Herzog's treatment of Treadwell is particularly important to consider because it is so prominent and therefore so powerful. The story of Timothy Treadwell also compellingly signals inchoate changes to ideas of humanity along the lines of what is increasingly being understood as the posthuman, mentioned above. For the pur- poses of this essay, a posthuman sensibility involves decentering humanity and acknowledging human dependence and animality. Donna Haraway's When Species Meet exemplifies these posthuman attributes in noting that "human genomes can be found only in about 10 percent of all the cells that occupy the mundane space I call my body; the other 90 percent of the cells are filled with the genomes of bacteria, fungi, protists, and such, some of which play in a sym- phony necessary to my being alive at all . . (3-4). Such posthuman ideas have undergone much investigation in disability theory, in ecoc- riticism, in science studies, and in other discourses. Though these dis- courses are focused differently, the conclusions drawn in them can seem strikingly congruent. All these areas of inquiry have similarly and thoroughly shown how much social reality impinges on the pro- duction of "objective" scientific knowledge.4 In each of these cases, moreover, ideas of the "normal" prove to be problematic and histori- cal, whether we apply "normal" to types of human bodies, to ideas about human agency, to notions of objective science, or the like. Bearing such work in mind, I suggest that the case of Treadwell begs for a reading strategy that intercedes between the exaggerated extremes of science's pure facts and narrative's pure fiction. Such a reading strategy has been under development for some time in many of the fields mentioned above. The interdisciplinary investigation that follows, then, begins (in the second section) with the most prominent treatment of Treadwell,</page><page sequence="4">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 85 the beautiful and problematic film by Warner Herzog, Grizzly Man. Using another recent animal documentary, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill directed by Judy Irving, as a comparator, I argue that Herzog's rendering of Treadwell as freakish depends upon a reduc- tive definition of nature and wilderness as hostile and upon Herzog's filmmaking motives. The third section investigates Timothy Treadwell himself at greater length, reading what he calls his "expe- ditions" to Alaska as a kind of becoming-animal freak show that con- sciously and unconsciously performs a critique of contemporary culture and of the documentary forms he imitates. The fourth and fifth sections use scientific studies of animals and bears to further investigate this case, registering also a caution about the power of science to silence other important forms of knowing. Defining Wild Animality in Grizzly Man and The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill5 These compelling documentaries, both released in 2005, treat several of the central issues in ecocriticism, often in opposite ways. They both present socially marginalized men who turn to wild animals for companionship, renewed identity, and purpose in life. But Grizzly Man is presented by its director Werner Herzog as some- thing of a tragedy, while The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill is more a comedy, in the classical sense of its ending-in-a-marriage solution. The first is set in remote Katmai National Park on the Alaskan penin- sula, while the second is set in the urban space of San Francisco. Herzog's movie highlights the brown bear, while Judy Irving's film deals with the ostensibly much humbler parrots, a species exotic to San Francisco whose intelligence has nonetheless made them key figures in debates about animality. Both films are centrally engaged with questions of what defines wildness, where we might find wil- derness, and how we ought to conduct ourselves facing the wild and/or the wilderness. I have called these films' genre "documentary," but the practice of that genre is in fact quite variable and complex. Indeed, Herzog self- consciously defies this problematic category in important ways because he is not strict about working a "documentary" fashion. As Richard John Ascárate has recently explained, "Herzog freely applies cinematographic techniques from one genre to the other [documen- tary and narrative]" (485). Further, Ascárate quotes Herzog in claiming, "I do not make documentaries, no sir, I don't make docu- mentaries." Herzog continues, "Even though some of them come quite close to it. But, since I imagine a lot . . . some of it is scripted,</page><page sequence="5">86 ISLE some of it is rehearsed, some of it is staged. So where's the borderline? For me the definition [of documentary] itself doesn't make so much difference. For me it's all just movies" (qtd. in Ascárate 497, note 1). Herzog's awareness of fluidity in film genres runs contrary to his stated insistence on high walls around different species' lives in Grizzly Man. Indeed, the film's tragic pathos depends largely on its message that Treadwell made the tragic hero's mistake of trasgres- sive hubris, going beyond his native identity as human and entering into dialogue with the world of the bears, a criticism that is partly warranted but also problematic. Those bears stand for the radical oth- erness of wild nature more generally in Grizzly Man , so that Treadwell's transgression is also against nature itself, keeping "nature" and "humanity" as opposed terms. Irving's film, however, does not insist as strongly on so segregated a view of different species in its conceptual framework. Irving and her subject Mark Bittner allow for the otherness of the birds, but close human interac- tions with them do not spell their or humans' ruin. In this way, parrots stand for a hybrid, persistent wildness that is not entirely foreign to humans in The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill The significance of bear/human and bird/human differences depends considerably on the way the films' images are framed with narratives. Toward the end of Grizzly Man , for instance, Herzog screens a series of bears while he criticizes what he sees as Treadwell's sentimental views. In this sequence, Herzog suggests that Treadwell ignored the harsher facts of nature, insisting instead on love for the grizzly bears. Conversely, Herzog offers his own view that "the common denominator of the universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and murder."6 This is his film's definition of "wild": absolute, unbridgeable difference. While screening captivating close- ups of grizzly faces, Herzog's voiceover reports contrarily, "what haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy" in them, only the "overwhelming indifference of nature." This opposition between a naive view of nature assigned to Treadwell and the osten- sibly truer, if harsher, view that humans and bears have no affinity appears often in treatments of the Treadwell case, as we see more fully below. Herzog supports his view of nature with reports of male grizzlies eating young bears in order to be able to mate again, with imagery of a young fox killed by wolves, and of course most dramati- cally with the tale of Treadwell, whose grizzly love ended in four deaths. Rhetorically, the power of death plays crucially here, helping Herzog to insist upon his conclusion that little genuine communica- tion between human and nature is possible. In the film's semiotic</page><page sequence="6">Timothy TreadweU's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 87 language, that power of death is embodied in the grizzly bear, the imposer of limits on humans. Freakish Treadwell is killed because he will not acknowledge the apparently normal and sane notion that nature is dangerous, deadly, completely other. Yet, Herzog also claims for Treadwell an otherness that he depicts with wonderful images of the erratic glacial ice viewed from above in a flyover. Herzog's voiceover asserts of Treadwell, "this ice in turmoil is a metaphor for his soul." Here, Herzog clarifies the theme of his film: it is not finally about bears, which he has presented as too other to be comprehensible. Instead, it is about TreadweU's behaviors, which also offer, Herzog insists, "insight into our selves, our nature." In other words, as I understand Herzog, TreadweU's actions reveal the strange and incomprehensible desires inherent in human beings. TreadweU's extremeness merely exaggerates characteristics that Herzog seems also to find in the rest of us, using stunning natural imagery, in the end, to make a point about humans. This interpretation of TreadweU's life gains support from the film's structure. As it proceeds, Treadwell seems to be in an ever greater turmoil that crests in his rant about the park service, part of which has been silenced by Herzog, as his voiceover explains. It is too extreme to bear representation; Treadwell has freaked out. Fittingly, then, according to Herzog's good narrative construction, TreadweU's final piece of footage follows a few scenes later. Yet this is apparently an inaccurate account of Treadwell. According to Nick Jans in his helpful and not exactly celebratory analysis of TreadweU's life and death, The Grizzly Maze , "Far from sliding downward into madness and despair, he'd become, if anything, happier and more stable as the years went on" (xiii).7 To acknowledge this complexity in the Treadwell story, however, would deflect the impact of Herzog's narra- tive arc and reiterate questions that his interpretation forecloses. If Herzog's film is not strict about documentary accuracy, it does have an ideological consistency. It seems to suggest that narrow self- interest and utter solitude are the final characterizations of all life on the Earth. Herzog's worldview resembles what Frans De Waal, a prominent scholar on primate behavior, labels the veneer theory of morality. De Waal's Tanner Lecture of 2003, republished with responses in the book Primates and Philosophers , argues specifically against that theory- the idea that moral behavior is a thin veneer spread over what is otherwise a base and nasty nature. De Waal's work has focused in particular on moral behaviors in nonhuman pri- mates, leading him to insist that human moral behavior is in fact natural and on a continuum with other animals (e.g. 62). In this same vein, two of biologist Marc Bekoff's books, The Emotional Lives of</page><page sequence="7">88 ISLE Animals (2007) aņd Minding Animals (2002), present many examples of complex emotional behavior among a wide range of animals, from magpies to dolphins to elephants. Bekoff, much like De Waal, insists on the centrality of animal emotions as part of their/our nature, a point which problematizes Herzog's charge of sentimentality against Treadwell. Moreover, Bekoff's newest book Wild Justice , co-authored with Jessica Pierce, argues that many nonhuman animals display actions that should be understood as moral. These scientists' work suggests that it is not at all clear that nature, especially animal nature, is in some final sense "hostile." Rather, alongside nature's familiar harshness are cooperation and mutual assistance, especially among social animals. So, if by "sentimental" we mean emotional identification with another, it is at least some- what appropriate to be sentimental about bears, who are not the murderous machines they are often made to be in criticisms of Treadwell. Several narratives about bears, including some by non- scientists, demonstrate this point. Doug and Andrea Peacock's recent book The Essential Grizzly, for instance, presents an instance observed by Doug in which a female bear fights off a male bear in order to protect her cubs, and then goes to some pains to help one of the cubs who had been swept down a swift river (94-97). He goes on to describe how that same mother refuses to "abandon her maimed cub" who has been injured in a forest fire (108) and continues to protect her young, ultimately helping both to survive. Such stories are neither new nor unusual and remind us that there are competing ways to define what it means to be a bear, much as there are compet- ing definitions of humanity. Similarly, there are competing ways to understand the meaning of Grizzly Man. The film, taken as a whole, is often at odds with the rather heavy-handed narrative Herzog's voice imposes upon it. Despite its narrative argument, Herzog's movie gestures toward types of affinities between the human and nonhuman when it uses ice as a metaphor for the human soul, or dis- plays the apparent likenesses between the mischievous foxes and Treadwell himself, or even when it suggests parallels among Treadwell's and the bears' fierce desires to survive. Irving's film The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill negotiates these tricky issues of the nature of nature and human/nonhuman difference more effectively than Herzog does. The otherness of animals and the harshness of nature also appear in Irving's film, but to very different overall effect. Most prosaically, the parrots occasionally upset the order of Bittner's home and sometimes annoy him. More dramati- cally, any notions of simple bird harmony are belied when they fall victim to maraudings by birds of prey, such as the key scene in which</page><page sequence="8">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 89 a hawk kills a bird that seems to be Conor, the blue-headed conyer. This death is a dramatic signifier in the film for the potential hostility of nature, to return to Herzog's term. But Irving does not insist upon this hostility as nature's deciding attribute. Rather, such deaths are located in a community of life that permits differences to co-exist. The film focuses on survival, on persisting human/nonhuman commun- ities, apparent even in the overwhelmingly human place that is the city. "Wild" in Irving's movie signifies the ability of these birds and of Mark Bittner to pursue ends suited to their unique forms of life, without suggesting that this pursuit implies constant militancy against all different beings. In the terms of Thomas Birch's "The Incarceration of Nature," an essay on ideologies of wild and wilder- ness, Herzog's approach to bears is Hobbesian, assuming that "we exist fundamentally in a state of war with any and all others" (447). This is not the case in Irving's film. The wild parrots, having escaped captivity and gathered as a mixed flock, figure this version of the wild as a kind of resilient hybridity, much different from the species purity and species solitude implicit in Herzog's film. Several stunning images of the green birds in flight over the city of San Francisco are especially concise and moving representations of this notion. This version of the wild has much in common with Gary Snyder's extended definition of that term in The Practice of the Wild , relevant here given Bittner's avowed interest in Snyder, as mentioned in the film. Particularly germane is Snyder's definition of wild animals as "free agents, each with its own endowments, living within natural systems" (9). Elsewhere in the book, Snyder also importantly reminds us that speciation is often specialization that obviates the need for competition (109, e.g. and passim). This idea reinforces Snyder's final point in his definition of the wild: a comparison of the wild to Chinese notions of Dao, which he defines as "eluding analysis, beyond categories, self-organizing, self-informing, playful, surprising, impermanent, insubstantial, self-authenticating, complete . . ." (10). These descriptions are akin to Irving's notions of the wild. Timothy Treadwell: Postmodern HumAnimal It is important to recognize that Treadwell's own ideas of the wild and of bears were in fact relatively complex and were more like Snyder's than Herzog's, a point missed by Herzog's accusation of sentimentality. For one, Treadwell clearly and obviously recognized the risk of death in confronting bears, which we can see even in the film, as he discusses the danger various bears pose. Treadwell's book</page><page sequence="9">90 ISLE Among Grizzlies , co-authored with Jewell Palovak, makes this aware- ness unmistakable. The first paragraph proclaims that "The grizzly bear is one of the very few animals remaining on earth that can kill a human in physical combat. It can decapitate with a single swipe . . (1). Indeed, the fact of danger is so present in Treadwell's text that it justifies complaints from the other side: He actually uses the danger of bears to make his dwelling among them more dramatic, part of his self-promotion. The passage quoted above goes on to say, "Within the last wilderness areas where they dwell, they are the undisputed king of all beasts. I know all this very well. My name is Timothy Treadwell, and I live with the wild grizzly" (1). This inaugural para- graph writes Treadwell's identity in terms of the bears' power, and makes his living among them a sign of his own prowess in a seem- ingly masculinist world that runs according to the power of "kings." This masculinist stance is difficult to unite with the side of Treadwell Herzog conveys, presented perhaps most clearly in Treadwell's phrase "I love you" delivered to the bears and foxes throughout the film. This complexity or contradiction in Treadwell has inspired Mike Lapinski's proposal that Treadwell may have been bipolar (98), a notion which also appears in a more degraded and derogatory form on the Internet and elsewhere. But that sort of per- sonal diagnosis obscures a host of larger issues. For one, the dynamics of the "I love you's" are themselves complex. The phrase signifies in a radically different fashion for human viewers in the cinema than it does for the bears who are its immediate audience, so it functions at once as animal vocalization and as speech. For the bears, its sing-song nature may well have helped Treadwell communicate his ostensibly peaceable intentions, as he believed. But that very same attribute- the sing-song sound- combined with the semantics of the phrase, lead many cinema viewers to think him simply foolish or crazy. Treadwell's "I love you's," then, in being recorded, are subject to placement in con- texts beyond his control, particularly since he could not have assented to Herzog's film. Their unusual appearance thus partly results from their technological reproduction. In such cases, we can understand Treadwell to dramatize the problems and contradictions of his moment and place in potentially productive ways, also of course always recognizing the unnecessary and tragic deaths involved. Treadwell's life, following a familiar pattern of American cultural critics, should thus be interpreted partly as a symptom of industrial- ized, urbanized modernity. He sought some way to inhabit the world that engaged him more fully than the average middle-class lifestyle he experienced in youth, which left him bored and restless. In Among Grizzlies , Treadwell discusses childhood fantasies of escape into outer</page><page sequence="10">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 91 space or on a "wild horse" or "with a pack of timber wolves" or as a "grizzly bear" (2). Though Jans's investigation teaches us to read this account of Treadwell's early life with some skepticism, Jans nonethe- less reinforces this notion that Treadwell had a "deep yearning for the extraordinary" (13). That yearning took him to the extremes of ordinary American selfhood in several directions. He sought fame in the television world of Los Angeles (Jans 15), experimented with drugs and nearly died of overdose (Treadwell 1-7; Jans 14-15), and of course immersed himself in the nonhuman world of other animals. Jans characterizes him in sum as "a guy that much at war with himself that he ran . . . trying, hoping desperately, to be someone else" (15). Treadwell's final turn toward wild nature both parallels and parodies a long line of Western civilization's critics. Treadwell's strong regard for nature and especially bears was explicitly ethical. However, many critics have convincingly contested Treadwell's claim that his primary job on the ground in Alaska was protecting bears from poachers (Jans 33-39; Łapiński 25-35). These critics claim that poaching was largely Treadwell's fabricated justifica- tion for his presence there. Thus, his seriousness also parodies ethical seriousness, as if to demonstrate the sort of lousy or even horrible things done in the name of ethics in the twentieth century. Such con- fused seriousness appearing with the formal attributes of television nature documentary performs a kind of critique of this "objective" genre, marking and exaggerating its constructed nature, an echo, probably accidental, of Gregg Mittman's argument in Reel Nature. Treadwell's appearances throughout the popular media before his death were often colored by these contradictions and complexities. He was frequently cast as saint or freak, which contributed to his success. His publicity included two visits on The David Letterman Show, a People magazine story about him, appearances on Discovery Channel and on Fox's Wild Things , and more (Jans 46-58). Whether saint or freak, his abnormal position was assured; he functioned much as unusual humans or two-headed animals did in the nineteenth- century stagings that Thomson calls "freak shows." Indeed, Treadwell resembled the many other exotic figures paraded around the talk- show circuit, a partial substitute for that earlier freak show. The public fascination with his unusual life has been paralleled by the sometimes gleeful "I told you so" treatments of his death, visible in the press and in Internet comments (in two typical examples from internet writers, he is called "Blonde Dumbass" by Jessica Schneider in her blog and "cartoonish" by Ashley Carter in an online article). Treadwell's personal danger haunts the entirety of Herzog's film as a sign of his abnormality, making the criticisms of him seem</page><page sequence="11">92 ISLE always-already obvious and often eliding a more nuanced analysis. The film returns to sites of trauma, calling viewers to inhabit those same spaces and dangers. The viewer's ensuing fear adds to the drama and thus to the compulsion of the story, which is central to the film's success, but fear often prevents consideration of the larger framework. While confronting grizzlies is obviously individually dangerous, of course the larger danger in human/bear interactions (as Treadwell always insisted) is for the grizzlies, who persist in only 1 percent of their former range in the lower 48 US states (Peacock and Peacock xii). Treadwell's story thus reiterates the persistent problem of reducing complex political situations to personal weaknesses. And it matters that Treadwell's seriousness was tempered by his self-mocking humor. At several points in his autobiographical Among Grizzlies , Treadwell is as hard on himself as others are. One night as a storm blows in, for instance, Treadwell satirizes his skills as an out- doorsperson: "I was smug about having anchored the tent. Such fore- sight! Such a smart camper! I drifted off to sleep listening to the howling winds." The next paragraph answers with a jolt: "Such an idiot!" (148). He goes on to detail his vain struggle against the storm, finally presenting the wreckage of the next morning: "My tent looked ridiculous . . ." (149). At such moments, Treadwell enacts a kind of satire not just of himself but also of humanity's vain self-importance, a satire that can help to clear space for other ways of living in the world.8 The figure of Treadwell might also thus be understood to pose a danger to the modern industrial machine by dramatizing its contra- dictions, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally. Perhaps most clearly, he shows industrial culture's alienation not only of pop- ulations of nonhuman animals, but also of large populations of humans and major parts of human experience. Indeed, publicizing these concerns to a broad audience was part of his explicit purpose. He amplified a series of large questions about human animality and ethics, questions that many are too quick to disavow by rashly criticizing him: What are our obligations toward animals? What does the industrial economy do to animal life everywhere? What parts of the human animal flourish in natural, nonhuman environments? What prices are paid for the conveniences of modern life?9 Bears Themselves Herzog finds in nature only "chaos, hostility, and murder." As a precise characterization of bears, such an account is simply romantic; even if it may accurately represent common fears. That bears can kill</page><page sequence="12">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 93 humans does not mean that they are killing machines. Stephen Herrero, professor of Biology and Environmental Science in Canada and a bear expert, writes in his book Bear Attacks : Their Causes and Avoidance that "Modern bears, with the exception of polar bears, have become somewhat chunky and unspecialized for killing." He explains, "Compared to specialized predators, bears are inefficient, relatively unsuccessful predators of large mammals" (143). Their evo- lutionary path has taken them from being carnivorous experts to becoming generalists at eating that take advantage of many different food sources (143-47). Indeed, as flexible omnivores, many commen- tators have suggested that bears resemble humans (Peacock and Peacock x-xi; Shepard and Sanders 6-7). Bears are thus a particularly poor biological choice to embody a reductive stereotype of nature- their nature is flexibility. Herrero explains, "Bears don't behave like robots. Each bear is an individual with a personality and a set of experiences. The outcome of experi- ence is learning. . . . Because of learning, each bear is able to tailor its response to a specific situation. Despite this, the range and extent of flexibility of behavior are constrained by genetic influences on behav- ior" (189). Temple Grandin argues that this is true of animals more generally: "Animal behavior is a complex mixture of learned behav- iors, biologically based emotion, and hardwired instinctual behavior" (309). This fact is part of why, as Herrero also reports, "in certain sit- uations, such as at McNeil River Falls [in Alaska], habituation can be safe for people and for bears" (194). At these falls, bears congregate to take advantage of a large salmon run. Food is so abundant that bears basically ignore the human bystanders. Any bears who do show an interest in people are hazed away by Alaska Fish and Game personnel. It is a situation in which bear, salmon, and humans inter- act in a complex fashion that is neither exactly "natural" nor entirely "constructed," and one that indicates the complex possibilities of animal lives. It also indicates how the character of a genetic code's expression- life- depends greatly on context, on the world in which it develops, and that world is greatly influenced by the powerful pro- ductions of media such as film.10 Discipline and Punish: Treadwell, Science, and the Importance of Narrative in Animal Studies Partly because Treadwell's combination of showmanship, bravado, and scientific aspiration provoked such anger, science is regularly and often sloppily used to reinforce criticisms of him. For instance, the report of Treadwell's and Huguenard's deaths in the Anchorage</page><page sequence="13">94 ISLE Daily News , by Craig Medred, devotes the first two brief paragraphs to giving the facts, then moves to science in the third paragraph, reproduced fully here: "Scientists who study Alaska brown bears said they had been warning Treadwell for years that he needed to be more careful around the huge and powerful coastal twin of the grizzly." While superficially this statement simply communicates the danger Treadwell put himself and others in, it implicitly assumes that he did not recognize this potential hazard, making it easier to dismiss any and all of the claims he made about the complexity of bears and especially the lives of humans under the tacit notion of his blithe, unscientific madness. Nick Jans also reports the views of several scientists whose dislike of Treadwell leads them to criticize him fiercely, though these criticisms are often framed scientifically in problematic ways. Time and again, science is used, often in an idealized objective form, as the only available measure of Treadwell's activities. Treadwell is then faulted for his scientific weaknesses, obscuring the existence and importance of narrative genres about animals. Jans, himself arguing that Treadwell was no bear biologist, quotes for evidence US Geological Survey ecologist Tom Smith, who says of Treadwell's Among Grizzlies : "There's not one thing- not one single thing- in that book I didn't already know or couldn't look up in five minutes" (57). But, surely, Smith did not already know Treadwell's life story. Jans also interviews a scientist whose criticisms of Treadwell and his science are so fierce that he remains unnamed in the text, though we may read some of what Jans calls his "spontaneous combustion" (160). This scientist says Treadwell was "an absolute disaster with bears"; he says Treadwell's survival was "an incredible testament to their [the bears'] patience. Look, there are only two reasons, from a mature bear's point of view, why any creature would approach it closely- to mate with it or displace it" (162). The final suggestion here implies that bear behavior has little or no flexibility, a point which in fact contradicts what this same scien- tist has said moments before: The bears at Katmai, where Treadwell spent much time, "are so tolerant, so laid back, you could have a day care center out there" (162). So perhaps these particular bears are more flexible even when closely approached. As the interview pro- ceeds, the scientist clarifies that his frustration derives from contradic- tions in Treadwell's life, including, centrally, getting two bears killed while purportedly working to protect them (163). While this concern is clearly legitimate, the unevenness of the nameless scientist's own discourse about Treadwell begs for a further accounting. Jans recog- nizes this problem and presents his own summary of the issue as a</page><page sequence="14">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 95 reasonable middle-ground: "Timothy may understand a great deal about bears, [but] it's strained and filtered through a decidedly unsci- entific perspective/' Jans calls Treadwell's book "anthropomorphic/' emotional, and lacking in data (57). 11 But even Jans's critique, like Tom Smith's mentioned above, is somewhat unfair, since, again, Treadwell does not present his book as pure science in the first place. Its title, Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska , announces its narrative or memoir character clearly. But for these critics, any treatment of animals seems implicitly to become the exclusive prov- ince of the sciences. In that sense, Jans and Smith use the same approach as less careful writers who participate in the cultural dis- missal of Treadwell as a freak.12 Furthermore, many of these criticisms are again incautious on the questions of science that their authors presume more mastery over than Treadwell had. The common complaint that Treadwell was anthropomorphic proves problematic, for example, in view of recent work in animal studies. Many will assume that Treadwell's practice of naming the bears or attributing them with different emotional states or even different personalities is the obvious evidence for his flaw of anthropomorphism. But there is much scientific work showing, we saw above, that social animals do in fact have emotions that resemble human emotions in important ways. Furthermore, De Waal devotes a section of Primates and Philosophers to the issue of anthropomorphism. He allows that "if anthropomorphism is defined as the misattribution of human qualities to animals, no one wishes to be associated with it" (63, my emphasis). But he goes on to say that, in the science of animal studies, "though no anthropomorphism pro- ponent would propose to apply such language uncritically, even the staunchest opponents of anthropomorphism do not deny its value as a heuristic tool" (63). It functions as a means to "get at the truth" about animals (63), a strategy that traces back even to Darwin, as De Waal reminds us. These important nuances disappear in the angry criticisms of Treadwell (admittedly partly because of Treadwell's own uneven knowledge on the questions). This messiness matters because Treadwell's story is so much more prominent than, say, the interven- tions in methods of animal studies by the likes of De Waal, Bekoff, Grandin, and even Jane Goodall. In her foreword to Bekoff's The Emotional Lives of Animals, for instance, Goodall recalls her own expo- sure to such attacks as a younger scientist: "I was criticized for my lack of scientific method, for naming the chimpanzees rather than assigning each a number, for 'giving' them personalities, and for maintaining they had minds and emotions. For these, I was told</page><page sequence="15">96 ISLE sternly, were attributes reserved for the human animal" (xii). Literary scholars might shift the terms here to note the resistance in these cri- tiques to the problematic but crucial form of knowledge that is narra- tive. Its central presence in the work of scientists like Goodall and Bekoff complicates the objectivity of science as a discourse and raises into view the host of issues explored in animal studies discourses. In her foreword, Goodall goes on to contrast what she calls her "common sense but ethologically revolutionary ideas" (xiii) with the normal thinking of her time about animals, a thinking still very prev- alent today outside of specialized circles, as the criticisms of Treadwell indicate. Goodall had to break out of approaches that treated animals as completely other than human, as "its," in order to arrive at her findings, including her paradigm-shifting observation that chimpanzees use tools, such as "grass stems to 'fish' for ter- mites" (In the Shadow of Man 279). This finding, of course, has helped scientists realize how much tool use exists among animals of many sorts; it began with her patient observation of a set of chimpanzees. In other words, it began with Goodall breaking with what was then conventional science, trusting instead in anecdote and narrative, which she then developed into systematic study that could be sup- ported by data, as she has explained in several contexts.13 For Goodall, an upshot of her years of study is that "there is no sharp line between the human animal and the rest of the animal kingdom. It is a blurred line, and becoming more so all the time" (Bekoff, The Emotional Lives xiii). In light of such pronouncements from important scientists, sympathy with nonhuman animals begins to appear as a necessary modality for science. Animal sympathy also begins to look more and more like sympathy for our human selves, or at least for part of ourselves.14 Such changes in the concepts of humans and animals often are not registered in criticisms of Treadwell, even in those by scientists. Instead, in the circus atmosphere of Treadwell dis- cussions, reinforced especially by the artful filmmaking of Herzog, sympathy with nonhumans is for lunatics. Conclusion: Animal Semiotics and Film Much research in animal studies has recognized some animal ges- tures and movements as kinds of signification. In some cases, such as the well-documented use of sign language among great apes or dol- phins' complex interpretations of gestures, it is becoming increasingly difficult not to call such abilities linguistic.15 So people, including perhaps Timothy Treadwell and Mark Bittner in Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill , can communicate with many animals by way of bodily</page><page sequence="16">Timothy Treadwell's Grizzly Love as Freak Show 97 gestures and movements. Such performativity of embodied human/ animal communication, visible in films of many sorts, seems inescap- ably connected to redefining what it means today to "have" and use language, to be a self. With such points in mind, Herzog's filmic treatment of Treadwell, in its mixing and crossing of genres and its staging of even the claims of scientists in the context of narrative, can be seen to resist too ready or easy a dismissal. Its full cinematic account offers a language that often runs in productive conflict with Herzog's narration, seeming at times to resemble the more explicit claims about hybrid and wild human/nonhuman relationships made in The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill. Thus, my criticisms notwithstand- ing, Grizzly Man can be read in congruence with a larger movement in which language and animality have begun a rapprochement. Media like film emphasize embodied semiotics, resisting narrow, anthropocentric and logocentric definitions of language and meaning-making. In films like Grizzly Man and The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill , the nature/culture dualism seems to slip or even dis- solve in a drama of interaction and interinvolvement as nature infil- trates highly "cultural" forms. Sometimes, as in Treadwell's case, the dualism reverses such that nature reclaims humanity through préda- tion. In these texts, human/nonhuman differences do not disappear, but they show as complex and fluid, recalling and underscoring such findings as those mentioned above by Bekoff, Goodall, and De Waal that point out fundamental human/nonhuman likenesses. Interdisciplinary fields such as ecocriticism are particularly well posi- tioned and perhaps obligated to signal the complexities of these matters to culture at large. Notes 1. Treadwell often referred to the bears he interacted with on the Alaskan coast as "grizzlies." However, as Nick Jans reports, coastal bears are more properly understood as brown bears, distinct from their smaller but more aggressive relatives the grizzlies (20). Technically, they are the same species. 2. Rosemarie Garland Thomson's Extraordinary Bodies shows how notions of normality often remain merely implicit in discourses about disability or difference. 3. A great deal of new scholarship has reiterated this point. For one concise argument, see Erica Fudge, "A Left-Handed Blow: Writing the History of Animals," in Representing Animals. Many of the essays in that volume speak to these questions. Also see Fudge's book Animal, Steve Baker, The Postmodern Animal, and the collection of essays Killing Animals, by the Animal Studies Group (among many other texts, cited below).</page><page sequence="17">98 ISLE 4. See Donna Haraway's classic Primate Visions for a compelling example of such science studies. In ecocriticism, the resistance to " anthropocentrism" has long been a theme, as Lawrence Buell indicates in The Environmental Imagination. Buell's work insists on the need for interdisciplinarity, as does much of Glen Love's seminal early work (see Practical Ecocriticism for a more recent example). Subsequent and often critical texts, such as Dana Phillips's The Truth of Ecology, have clarified the hazards of interdisciplinarity in ecocri- ticism without renouncing its value in general. 5. See Jennifer K. Ladino for another comparison of Grizzly Man to a par- allel "documentary," Winged Migration in her case. 6. All film quotations in this essay are my own transcriptions. 7. In addition to Treadwell's Among Grizzlies and Jans's book, a third book by Mike Łapiński, Death in the Grizzly Maze: The Timothy Treadwell Story, adds some elements not present in the other books. Jans's text seems to me the most thorough and even-handed. 8. Treadwell's story opens compelling connections to weakness, disability, and animal theory beyond those I can discuss here. Thomson's book Extraordinary Bodies, cited above, takes a place among a number of studies that criticize notions of able humanity, complicating our ideas of ourselves in ways that connect to ecocritical work. Lennard J. Davis, Bending over Backwards: Disability, Dismodernism, and Other Difficult Positions, and Martha C. Nussbaum, Frontiers of Justice: Disability, Nationality, Species Membership, announce human weakness as a necessary addition to our self-conceptions, as does Jacques Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am. Though this latter text does not call itself disability theory, I think it helpful to read it in that context. 9. The Peacocks' book treats this subject well (e.g. 41, 44), as does Herrero's concluding discussion of the worth of bears (247-49). 10. It is important also to recognize that the "circumstances at McNeil, however, allow for almost complete management of people's behavior and activities. This is seldom possible elsewhere" (Herrero 194). 11. Łapiński also charges Treadwell with anthropomorphism (13). 12. See Jessica Schneider's web log, "Timothy Treadwell: Blonde Dumbass" and Ashley Carter for examples. A Google search for "Treadwell" yields many similar reactions. 13. See In the Shadow of Man, for instance, and Goodall's Foreword to Bekoff's The Emotional Lives of Animals. 14. Derrida offers a crucial intervention in thinking about self-other rela- tionships by criticizing the fundamentalism of the idea of otherness in his revolutionary posthumous book The Animal That Therefore I Am (e.g. 102). 15.
