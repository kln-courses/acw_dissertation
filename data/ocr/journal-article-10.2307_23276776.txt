<plain_text><page sequence="1">19 Hermes as Master of Lions at the Syme Sanctuary, Crete* Angeliki Lebessi Cretan iconography in the early first millennium appears peculiar in comparison with that of the rest of Greece, so that scholars are sometimes enticed into assessments that are divorced from reality.1 This is especially the case when no consideration has been given to the local factor, which, in the Greek world, varied considerably before the sixth century.2 In fact, the peculiarity of Cretan art reflects a cultural reality: the independent development of a pictorial idiom with the aid of earlier, Minoan or Mycenaeanising motifs, which were adapted in terms of form and meaning to fit into the new perceptual framework. Cretan art was also enriched at an early stage with imported motifs that arrived in an early wave of Near Eastern influences during the second half of the ninth century, but did not reach the rest of Greece until the late eighth century.3 The singular representation of a Master of Lions on a mould-made votive plaque from Syme belongs within this intricately woven web of past and present and is presented here to Peter Warren as a modest antidoron for his many contributions to the study of Minoan religion. The representation, executed in relief, was found broken in three non-joining fragments that belonged to one or two terracotta plaques impressed in the same mould (FIG. 19.1 a-c).4 For brevity's sake they will be referred to here as if they were parts of the same plaque, although the less likely alternative—that they belonged to two identical plaques — cannot be entirely excluded. In FIG. 19.2 a partly preserved winged human figure in frontal stance is reconstructed in a drawing. The wings are pointed and grow out of the shoulder blades, extending upwards. The arms are held alongside the body, with the hands placed on the heads of two lions with closed mouths, who are represented in profile and in contact with the lower part of the figure's body. The position of the heads implies that the animals were represented rearing up on their bent hind legs, while their raised front legs rested on the figure's thighs. The trace of a raised rib near the broken right edge of fragment (c) indicates that the animals' tail curled upwards, turning out at the tip.5 The figure's long, oval face and the 'archaising', angular shape of the wings are the only evidence for dating this representation in the Middle Daedalic period.6 The quiescent pose of the lions and their rectangular heads with the closed mouth — visible on the best preserved head — are features of an imported prototype, whose Cretan version had been developed by c. 675-650.7 The long wings identify the central figure as demonic or divine. The sex is unclear as is also the connection of the hands with the lions' heads, because the low relief has been incorrectly imprinted at this point. The identification of the figure as either a Potnia or a Master of Lions is equally possible, since winged figures of both genders flanked by lions or mythical creatures are common in Greek iconography in the seventh century.8 Nevertheless, a Master is the only likely choice for the figure on the Syme plaque. The rectangular upper torso is completely flat and the preserved part of the horizontal relief line at the waist suggests that the figure is wearing the typical garment of a Cretan male — the short, tightly clinched chiton with a barely perceptible over-fold at the sides, which is worn by many male figures on two-dimensional Cretan representations of the seventh and sixth centuries.9 In any case, there is no indication of breasts either in relief or by means of small impressed circles, as in other Cretan female figures of clay in the seventh century. * I am indebted to my colleague, P.

Fig. 19.2. Reconstructed drawing of the Master of Lions (by N. Dolia).</page><page sequence="3">HERMES AS MASTER OF LIONS AT THE SYME SANCTUARY, CRETE There are no typological parallels for this composition, although some of its iconographic elements occur on contemporary Cretan plaques. For example, the wings and frontal stance of the Master also characterise the naked Master of Animals on a cut-out plaque from Gortyn, while the rare motif of the hands touching the animals' heads occurs on another plaque from the same site that represents a Master of Griffins, who wears the same chiton as the figure on the Syme plaque.10 However, the gesture of the Masters from Gortyn, who repulse the animals with their bent and extended arms, is completely different, as is also the relationship between the Master and the griffins on the second plaque from Gortyn: the griffins, roaring with open beaks, resist the soothing gesture of the hands of the transcendental being. Thus, the basic typological difference of the Master of Lions from Syme is his benign, close connection with the lions that submit willingly to his protective authority. The benevolent relationship of the supernatural being with the wild animals also distinguishes the representation on the Syme plaque from the two Near Eastern types of the Master that are prevalent in Cretan iconography from the ninth century on.11 The latter convey either the superiority of the male figure over an attacking lion or the confrontation of the Master with two roaring, aggressive lions that flank him. The heraldic version of confrontation is latent even in the compo sition of the Master flanked by winged horses that occurs on votive plaques from Lato or on the shoulder of a Cretan pithos in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.12 There are no thematic parallels in Crete or the rest of the Greek world for this particular type of the Master of Lions. Indeed, in order to represent the benign relationship of a male or female figure to a quiescent lion the workshops of mainland Greece and the islands in the seventh and sixth centuries had to adopt another Near Eastern type. However, the Oriental prototype of the 'Lion Tamer' on the well-known ivory plaque from Delphi (c. 675-650) evoked no response in Crete.13 By contrast, the benevolent relationship of the Master with two wild animals is common on Minoan and Mycenaean seals,14 where the Master of Animals occurs much more often than his female counterpart and is more frequently associated with lions than with any other animal, real or imaginary.15 It may not, therefore, be coincidental that the Master of Animals is often represented with lions in Crete during the first millennium or that he occurs more often than the Potnia, who is more favoured in the rest of Greece.16 These thematic correspondences in Cretan icono graphy over the course of two millennia are most likely reflections of the local factor that has already been noted as the fundamental element of Cretan art in the first half of the first millennium. They demonstrate that the rare type of the Master of Lions on the Syme plaque incorporated the Near Eastern motif of the winged human being into the local representational idiom that derives inspiration from the Minoan past. A similar amalgam of past and present has been noted regarding other Cretan representations of the Master or Mistress of Animals in the first millennium.17 The frequent representation of the Master of Animals on the seals and sealings of the second millennium would support the proposition that the image on the plaque also retained the same symbolic meaning that it had in the Minoan past, an idea that has already been suggested.18 The authorities in charge of Minoan bureaucracy would have needed religious sanction to legitimise their administrative activities. There is, in any case, evidence for the religious and ritual symbolism of the Master of Felines in the second millennium, as is clear in the painted decoration of a LH IIIA2 rhyton from a Rhodian tomb, which has an attached bucranium on the lip.19 Nevertheless, even if a symbol can be traced back from a later to an earlier culture within the same geographical area, it still represents a new ideological perception and cannot be assumed to have retained its original semiotic value. A human figure in an emblem atic representation with a wide local distribution within the same period remains anonymous as long as the assignment of a name is not based on contextual associations. The identification of the Master or Mistress of Animals is impossible, even when the name of the deity worshipped at the sanctuary where their representations had been offered is known, since several deities were commonly worshipped alongside the principal divinity. In other words, the meaning and name of the Master or Mistress ofAnimals depends on the kind of votive on which they were represented, on the period, on the associated finds and, most importantly, on the character of the site where they were found.20 A single, overall interpretation of the Master of Lions, on the premise that he was frequently represented on artistic products of the same geo graphical area, as is the case in Crete during the first millennium, is also of dubious validity.21 10 Rizza and Scrinari 1968, pi. 121, no. 127 and pi. 26, no. 166. 11 Matthaus 2005, 306, 350.

It is firstly the diachronic characteristics of the sanctuary, i.e. its mountainous location with the dense, wild vegetation, its inter regional character and the continuous use of the site for cultic purposes from c. 2000 BC to the sixth or seventh century AD.22 The votives and inscriptions of the first millennium, which are chronologically the most closely associated finds, document the worship of Hermes kedrites and Aphrodite, the attendance of pilgrims from many settlements in east and central Crete, and the practice of maturation rituals for both male and female participants throughout this period.23 Prominent males offered objects of metal, while women dedicated only clay votives, the majority of which represent female figures.24 One of the basic differences between the second and the first millennium is that in the former period the female figure is absent from the sanctuary, which seems male-dominated. By contrast the female sex appears in the Protogeometric period and co-exists with the male throughout the first millennium, just like the male and female couple that the votaries worshipped. The division of the votives according to their material between the two sexes of the votaries corresponds to the distinct roles of Hermes and Aphrodite, while the collaboration of the two deities in the maturation rituals served a common goal: the sexual intercourse of those members of Cretan society who were of marriageable age and came to the sanctuary to request protection during their passage from adolescence to adulthood. The diachronic features of the Syme sanctuary and the contextual associations of the plaque provide supportive evidence for the identification of the Master of Lions with Hermes and contribute to the decipher ment of the symbolism inherent in this dedication. The lions as a symbol of dominance over wild nature signified the dangers faced by all those coming from the civilised settlement centres to an inter-regional cult place, which was under the protection of the god depicted on the plaque. It is worth mentioning here that the birth of Hermes in a cave of mountainous Arcadia as well as the areas where the young god carries out his famous deeds {Hymn. Horn. Merc. 4. 1-5,10-16) in order to secure a place in the Olympian pantheon, were all located at the eschatia, just like the sanctuary at Syme.25 The identification of the supernatural winged figure with Hermes can be based on non-Cretan parallels. Corinthian or Corinthianising vases from various areas, dated c. 600-550, represent the willing submission of wild animals to Hermes, who can be identified by the herald's staff.26 He is also the winged god, who stands or sits engaged in peaceful occupations on Attic vases of the same period.27 Furthermore, Hermes is the god recognised throughout Greece as the divine conductor of immortals, heroes and mortals whom he protected in every difficult transition.28 The maturation rituals for young girls that were practised at the mountain sanctuary of Syme under the protection of Hermes and Aphrodite constitute the elements of a 'religious landscape' that corresponds to a specific mythical event: the epiphany of Aphrodite, as a mortal girl, before Anchises, who is persuaded that it was Hermes who had kidnapped her from the 'meadows of the maidens' and led her through the forests of Mt Ida to his humble hut.29 The involvement of Hermes with Aphrodite in the midst of an untamed landscape, by means of poetic license, constitutes the basic feature of another mythical tale that is iconographically documented. In an impressive scene of the Judgement of Paris on a 'Melian' amphora of the late seventh century, produced in a Parian workshop, Hermes is shown as a winged figure, dressed in royal garments (?) and carrying the herald's staff.30 He leads Hera, Athena and Aphrodite towards Paris, walking alongside the fearsome Chimaera, who submits to his divine authority. This scene, in which Chimaera is removed from the well known myth of Bellerophon and submits to Hermes, is not a 'peculiarity' of the Parian workshop. These features also occur on a clay plaque of the late seventh century from Lato.31 On the plaque the representation is divided into two registers: in the lower, Chimaera is represented in a quiescent, semi-crouched position, while in the upper a winged Master of Birds, facing forward moves towards the viewer's left. The Master wears the same garment as the Master of Lions/Hermes from Syme and is shown running in the knielauf stance above the curve of the Chimaera's tail, as if he were moving in the boundless, wild landscape that the monster symbolises. There is other evidence of convergent views concerning Hermes in Paros and Crete in the seventh 22 Lebessi 2002, 3-5. 23 Lebessi 1981, 2-6; Lebessi and Stephanakis 2004, 179-87. 24 Lebessi 1985, 188-98; 2002, 269-82.

He is represented as a king on a bronze cut out plaque of690-670 from Syme and also on the neck of a hydria produced in a Parian workshop c. 650-640. In the Parian version he is surrounded by spiral tendrils and wears a chiton decorated with a huge bird and a smaller animal.32 The narrative character of the Parian vases is better suited than the emblematic representa tions of the Cretan votives for signifying the authority of Hermes over wild nature.33 Hermes as the Master of Lions may also lie behind another votive from Syme. The tame silver lion on the head of a sceptre traces the office of a magistrate-cosmos in charge of the organisation of the maturation rituals back to Hermes Master of Lions. This official honoured the divine protector of the sanctuary by offering him a sceptre of authority made of precious material.34 The connection of Hermes with Chimaera in the Judgement of Paris or of Hermes with the Master of Animals on the terracotta votive from Syme are pictorially rendered variations of religious beliefs in the beneficial influence of Hermes on real or imaginary wild animals. The Greek perception of his authority over the animal kingdom is expressed in mythical terms as the privilege 'to concern himself... with fierce lions ... and all that the broad earth nourishes', which Hermes received from Apollo, after Zeus had resolved the quarrel of the two brothers and completed the hierarchy of the gods by accepting young Hermes into the Olympian pantheon.35 The composition of the Hymn to Hermes, perhaps in the late sixth century, is inspired by oral tradition to a greater degree than that of the other Homeric hymns.36 Oral tradition also formulated the story of the Judgement of Paris, which was not included in the Homeric epics.37 It seems therefore that in the seventh century local craftsmen selected their subjects from a wider repertory of variant, popularly appealing myths, perhaps because the myths corresponded, to a certain degree, to some of the rituals in which people partici pated. In other words, it is possible that the maturation rituals that were practised at the mountainous Syme sanctuary inspired the representation of Hermes as Master of Lions, a concept that conformed to the development of his personality in myth. Myths and rituals constitute inter-connected means of expression in Archaic society, which were formulated in tandem, so that elements of ritual could be latent in myth making, particularly in the myths about Hermes, who was friendly towards humans and assisted them to a greater degree than the other Olympians.38 If, then, the lions on the Cretan plaque symbolise the mountainous location of the Syme sanctuary, Chimaera on the Parian amphora most likely signified the region and the dangers lurking in the forests of Mt Ida in the Troad, where myth locates the contest among the three goddesses.39 The correlation between Hermes-Master of Lions and Hermes-Tamer of Chimaera does not mean that the myth of the Judgement of Paris originated in female maturation rites.40 Nevertheless, if the divine beauty contest is a reflection of secular contests, it is possible that the latter derived from maturation rituals, because the concept of trial, as well as the beauty that characterises the young, constitute the essence of both these social activities. The real trial for every participant in a beauty contest corresponds to the symbolic passage of a girl from adolescence to adulthood, while the feature of youthful beauty is referred to at the Syme sanctuary by means of the epithet kala or kalai that accompanies feminine names on graffiti of the Hellenistic period.41 According to literary sources, beauty contests may have begun during the floruit of aristocratic society in the seventh century,42 i.e. in the same period that Hermes is represented as dominating the fearsome Chimaera in the narrative representation of the divine contest on the Parian pithos or as Master of Animals in the heraldic composition of the plaque from Syme. It is also in the seventh century that there is an increase in the number of plaques representing single, usually young, females, who requested from Aphrodite, the companion deity of Hermes at Syme, the pre-marital gift of beauty as a means of erotic attraction.43 Their request is represented on the plaques from the sanctuary through the idealised nudity of the youthful body, which is enhanced by means of the shawl and the festive polos, according to the prototype of the honoured goddess, Aphrodite (FIGS. 19.3-4).44 The emulation, in part, of the goddess by the mortal woman does not imply the latter's deification, but signified the divine quality that the votary wished to appropriate for herself.45 32 Lebessi 1985, 85-7, no. alpha 2, pis. 2, 52; 156-7 n. 455, pi. 59 upper right. 33 See Clay 1989, 141 n. 142 for a discussion of the textual evidence. 34 Lebessi 2001, 10-2. 35 Hymn.

Young votary on a mould-made plaque from Syme. Fig. 19.4 (right). Aphrodite of the anasyrma type on a mould-made plaque from Syme. Nevertheless, the marriageable girl also needed the assistance of Hermes, who, as the divine conductor, ensured her passage from her father's house to that of her husband. Hermes carries out the same role in a secular procession, represented according to the idealised model of the 'sacred marriage', on an Attic Black Figure amphora of the sixth century.46 The progress of the bride oikothen and oikade (Pind. 01. 7.4) is clearly shown on an Attic pyxis, dated to 440 BC, by the house door that is represented at the start and finish of the procession; the youth preceding the wedding cart is here equated with Hermes pompaios by means of his garments.47 Given that Hermes is often represented together with real or imaginary animals throughout Greece and also that women offered clay votives at the Syme sanctuary, the dedication of the plaque representing the god as Master of Lions can be ascribed to a young female votary. Indeed it was precisely the sex of the votary that conditioned the selection of the rare motif of the benevolent relationship of the honoured deity with lions; evidently, because the widely known Near Eastern type of the confrontation between Master and wild animals, which corresponded to the pre occupation of men with hunting,48 was incompatible with the role of women within their father's or husband's household. This is the underlying reason why a type that portrayed the protective relationship of Hermes with wild animals was developed. It is not unlikely that this type was inspired by a Minoan or Mycenaeanising prototype, since Cretan craftsmen frequently encountered artefacts of the past in cemeteries or cult places.49 From these relics they 46 Berard 1984, 94, fig. 135. 47 Oakley and Sinos 1993, 31 n. 60, figs. 75-8. 48 Fittschen 1969, 80-1, 87. 49 E.g.
