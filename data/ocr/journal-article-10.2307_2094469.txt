Analysis of data from a sample of Worth Carolina Episcopalians shows that this theory not only explains multidimensional religiosity patterns, but also provides a parsimonious interpretation for the effects of education and community size. Implications for the changing social basis of church religion in modern society and the process of secularization are discussed. Despite advances in conceptualizing and measuring religious commitment in recent years, remarkably little progress has been made in developing systematic, empirically testable theories of religion. Empirical studies on individual religiosity are typically descrip- tive and exploratory, concerned more with unravelling the multidimensional forms of commitment than with explaining why such patterns exist. Furthermore, the sociological explanations given are often burdened by in- stitutional assumptions about traditional re- ligion that are questionable, if not untenable, in modem society. This paper examines some of these sub- stantive issues and offers a theory of religious commitment, focusing upon local-cosmopoli- tan sectors as plausibility structures for "church" religion in contemporary society. My purpose here is two-fold: to develop more fully this theory, fragments of which are dis- * This paper reports on a reanalysis of data made possible by funds granted by the Research Council, University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Thus the paper is addressed to the need for con- structing more satisfactory, multidimensional theories based upon realistic assumptions about the plausibility of traditional religion in modern, industrial societies. As we shall see, approaching the problem this way yields not only an alternative theory, but also provides an explanatory scheme for interpreting the ef- fects of several other correlates of religious commitment. Preliminary Considerations Among the many social correlates of religi- ous commitment, four have probably received more attention in empirical research than any others: social class, sex, age and generation. These have all been examined, either separate- ly or in combination, in relation to various measures of religion, and are topics of ex- tended theoretical discussion. A brief review of these interpretations, plus their major limitations, provides the background for the present study. In accounting for why the social correlates above are important, theorists usually develop either a socialization or a deprivation-compen- 195</page><page sequence="2">196 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW sation explanation. The first is especially manifested in discussions on social roles and how they influence an individual's "style" of religiosity. For example, women are more re- ligious than men, presumably because of dif- ferential sex roles in American society. Be- cause wife and mother roles are expressive, they are viewed as more congruent with re- ligious values and sentiments (see Argyle, 1958; Glock et al., 1967:41-5). Interpreting the importance of age is less straightforward, but the conventional argument holds that be- yond age 35 there is a steady increase in re- ligious activity until old age (Fichter, 1952; Glock et al., 1967:38-59). Adulthood usually involves family responsibilities which, when combined with maturation, favor religious commitment. Members of differing social classes, likewise, are socialized into contrast- ing lifestyles and vary considerably in their participation in voluntary organizations. Middle-class people generally tend to partici- pate more in organizations and thus are more inclined to become affiliated with, and in- volved in, religious groups (Lenski, 1961 :44ff; Goode, 1966; 1968). Finally, generation is an important correlate, mainly as an index of as- similation calling attention to the tendency for Americans to become socialized into re- ligious, and especially church-going, norms (Herberg, 1960; Lazerwitz and Rowitz, 1964; Lazerwitz, 1970). Deprivation has been, however, the pre- dominant interpretation of religious involve- ment and commitment. Glock et al. (1967), for example, argue that women, older people and the lower socioeconomic classes-those most deprived socially in American society- find alternative gratification through religious involvement. Other theorists, focusing upon social class variations, have sought to refine the deprivation argument by means of multi- dimensional considerations. Fukuyama (1961), Demerath (1965) and Goode (1966; 1968) reason that the lower classes are more likely to "feel" and "believe" their religion whereas the upper and middle classes place greater stress upon the "doing" aspects. By distinguishing between types of commitments, they are able to show that social class is in- versely related to orthodox belief and devo- tionalism, but positively associated with the behavioral aspects of religious participation, such as church attendance and parish ac- tivities. The deprived are "sect-like" and the privileged "church-like" in styles of religious commitment. Both the socialization and deprivation in- terpretations rest upon an "institutional" model of religion which generally assumes that religious values are widely shared throughout the society. This fundamental as- sumption is, however, questionable in a highly differentiated society where religious norms are increasingly segregated from other institu- tional sectors. The case is that in modern soci- ety, obligations associated with age, sex and class roles can be fulfilled without serious at- tention to religious norms. Individuals not ex- posed to religious teachings cannot be ex- pected to express such values in their every- day roles and activities. Moreover, it is unlike- ly in a secular culture that deprived persons will find sufficient compensation in other- worldly rewards. As the plausibility of tradi- tional religion declines, so does the likelihood that people will turn to it as a source of grati- fication. This latter was forcefully underscored by Rodney Stark (1972) in a reappraisal of deprivation theory. After reviewing the recent evidence, he concludes that economic depriva- tion may predict differences in religiosity among church members, but not for the American population as a whole. Among those who have only minimal religious affilia- tions, class differences simply do not hold as deprivation theory predicts. Even in the realm of religious ideology, often cited as a haven for the dispossessed, his national data show that the lower classes are less committed than the middle and upper classes. Commenting upon this, Stark (1972:500) writes: In order for economic deprivation to result in certain kinds of religious commitment it is necessary first that a religious perspective is a plausible option for the deprived per- sons in question. If they have retained some minimal connection with religious perspectives, then it seems to follow that</page><page sequence="3">TRADITIONAL RELIGION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 197 poverty and failure will motivate persons to seek the comforts of faith. But the fact remains that the economically deprived are those for whom religious options are least likely to be relevant. In society, generally, economic deprivation operates mainly to shut persons off from religion rather than to drive them into faith as a means of com- pensation. Hence it seems unreasonable to expect that individuals in a secular society will offer re- ligious interpretations either for their worldly fortunes or their misfortunes. In the absence of a religiously-based moral order, structural- functional interpretations of commitment in terms of role and status position would appear to be less and less satisfactory. In effect, the plausibility of church religion is itself prob- lematic in modern society and cannot be tak- en for granted. Local-Cosmopolitan Plausibility Structures An alternative approach for analyzing re- ligion is to focus more directly upon the prob- lem of plausibility. Rather than assuming that church-related values provide the basis for cul- tural integration in society, it is appropriate to determine the social sectors in modern life in which traditional symbols and rituals are meaningful, and then to formulate theories about these as the social basis of church re- ligion in a secular order. This approach is con- sistent with, and extends suggestions arising out of several recent critiques of structural- functional interpretations of religion, includ- ing those of Luckmann (1967), Fenn (1970; 1972) and Estus and Overington (1970). Approached in this way, we begin by ask- ing: under what conditions would we expect church religion in contemporary society to be plausible? A sociology of knowledge perspec- tive suggests that the primary prerequisite for any belief system is the presence of an ade- quate socio-communal support structure. That is, definitions of social reality are "real" inso- far as they are confirmed through day-to-day interactions among those who share a similar perspective. Such a social base-what Peter Berger (1967) refers to as "plausibility struc- ture"-is indispensable for maintaining any kind of world view, religious or otherwise. Should the plausibility structure begin to lose its intactness or continuity, the subjective re- alities and meanings will themselves lose persuasiveness. Berger argues that in the modern world the plausibility structures for church religion have diminished in scope-from society as a whole to smaller, more circumscribed social enclaves. Because traditional beliefs and values are less and less capable of furnishing overarching symbols unifying society, religious plausibility is increasingly restricted to smaller "sub- worlds" of social experience. The latter are associated more with the private than with the public sectors of life; and structures such as the family, ethnic group or some other limited social sphere play a crucial part in sustaining personal religious loyalties. One such sphere in modern society, curi- ously neglected in studies on religion, is the local community. Contrary to the claims of mass society theorists, the local community has not withered in rapid dissolution as a pri- mary-group structure. It persists as a complex system of friendship and kinship networks, formal and informal associations as well as symbolic attachments, very much rooted in family life and on-going socialization pro- cesses. An extensive body of research litera- ture, in fact, underscores the continuing im- portance of locality attachments and partici- pation (see Babchuk and Edwards, 1965; Greer, 1962; Hunter, 1975; Kasarda and Jano- witz, 1974; Suttles, 1972). Like the family, it is, in Benita Luckmann's words (1970), a major "small life-world"-a micro-universe around which experiences may be structured and interpreted in the modern world. Studies ot people's attachments to com- munities have come to be codified largely around the local-cosmopolitan distinction. Following Merton (1957), who first intro- duced localism and cosmpolitanism as refer- ence orientations, the concepts describe the scale of social experience and participation ranging from one's immediate social networks to the broader society. This dimension has proven to be useful in research on political</page><page sequence="4">198 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW ideology (Nelson and Tallman, 1969; Ladd, 1972; Dye, 1963), prejudice (Liu, 1961), pro- fessional commitments (Gouldner, 1957; Blau and Scott, 1962) and lifestyles (Dobriner, 1958; Stone and Form, 1953; Thielbar, 1966). Frequently shown is the fact that local-cosmopolitan orientations are associated with level of education and social class, but that the range of independent variation in people's perspectives is considerable. In this respect, localism-cosmopolitanism may be thought of as a distinct axis of social differen- tiation and one which is especially insightful for analyzing traditional versus nontraditional patterns in contemporary life. A Theory of Religious Commitment Focusing upon local community attach- ments and interactive networks as a plausibil- ity structure for church religion, it is argued that locals are more religious-as measured by the conventional indicators of institutional commitment. Such a theory of religious plausibility can be developed in terms of both social participation and ideology. As to social participation, locals tend to favor voluntary organizations in which stable, communal relations are possible. That churches provide opportunities to develop such bonds is evidenced by the extent to which friendships exist among congregational members. Among Protestant and Catholic groups in the United States, according to Stark and Glock (1968:167), two-thirds of all parishoners report having friends in their con- gregations. Because of their strong primary- group ties, locals probably obtain satisfaction from socio-religious group involvement for social as well as religious needs. Among these are group-identification and awareness of soci- al location, which for many people in a plural- ist society are perhaps the most important functions of religious membership. This is es- pecially true in American society where, for historical and social reasons, religious groups have long played, as Greeley (1972:115ff) says, a "quasi-ethnic" role in providing a sense of belonging. Turning to beliefs and ideology, it is rea- sonable to expect greater congruence of life- experiences and traditional religious beliefs and practices among locals than among cos- mopolitans. Thielbar (1966) reports that locals tend to personalize their interpretations of social experience, which no doubt reflects at the cognitive level the immense importance they attach to interpersonal norms. For this reason, perhaps, they find anthropomorphic conceptions of the Deity more acceptable than do cosmopolitans. Orthodox beliefs, as well as private religious practices, should en- tail fewer cognitive strains among those who espouse traditional life-styles and values. In an earlier study, I have shown that local community reference is a good predictor of both socio-religious group participation and personal beliefs and practices (Roof, 1972). This research demonstrated that local-cosmo- politan differences in religiosity persisted even when statistical controls were introduced for social class, education, age and sex. Rather than simply replicating this, my purpose here is to explore ways in which local-cosmo- politan orientations may be incorporated into a more comprehensive theory of religious plausibility. To do this, it is necessary to ex- amine in some detail two important social cor- relates of religiosity: education and commun- ity size. Both of these correlates imply social psychological consequences for religiosity, and recent research underscores the need for greater clarification of these intervening pro- cesses. Education. Though education is often cited as a correlate, seldom do researchers fully ex- plain why, or exactly how, it affects religious commitment. The extent of formal schooling is typically treated as a social status indicator, emphasizing the differential styles of religios- ity for social classes (cf. Demerath, 1965; Goode, 1966; Estus and Overington, 1970). Yet education as status clearly does not ex- haust its import for religion. Just as easily, education can erode religious inclinations by prompting individuals to doubt and to ques- tion their beliefs and practices. Education ex- poses people to new perspectives and values- "contact effect" as Stouffer (1955) described it-generating incompatibilities in commit-</page><page sequence="5">TRADITIONAL RELIGION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 199 ment that may result in disbelief and/or dis- affiliation. Gabennesch (1972) addresses this possibility, arguing that individuals with broad social perspectives generally tend to hold less rigid, less reified moral commitments. This raises the interesting possibility that education may generate alternative, and per- haps even opposing, effects on religiosity. Education can result in broadened perspec- tives which, in turn, may undermine the plausibility of traditional religious beliefs and practices. But also it holds that education can raise a person's social status, leading perhaps- especially in the realm of socio-religious group participation-to greater religious activity. Dis- tinguishing between these two outcomes, and assessing their alternative effects, are issues to be explored. Community size. Rural-urban differences in religion are generally acknowledged. As city size increases, orthodox beliefs tend to de- cline. Religious participation also declines, al- though city size appears to have less impact on the behavioral dimensions of religion than on beliefs (Nelsen et al., 1971; Fischer, 1975a).' Recent research suggests that the influ- ences of urban residence on traditional values are due primarily to the social milieu of cities, not to the concentrations of population per se (Fischer, 1975a; 1975b; Inkeles, 1969;Portes, 1973). That is, the major impact of urban life in this realm is attributable to the diffusion of new values and perspectives which challenge, or erode, traditional meanings. As Gans' case study (1962) of "urban villagers" illustrates, urbanism entails, in addition to urban loca- tion, the discarding of narrow, particularistic views in favor of broadened social orienta- tions-in effect, cosmopolitanism. In Fischer's words (1975a), cosmopolitans are the "modernizing agents" who espouse alternative outlooks, establish nontraditional lifestyles and build up deviant subcultures. I At least in North America, this pattern holds. Outside North America, there are stronger negative associations between city size and church atten- dance. This is especially true in European cities where both religious beliefs and participation are in- creasingly removed from sectors of modern life. As with education, we have reason to con- ceptualize localism-cosmpolitanism as playing an important intervening role in transmitting the effects of community size. Most, if not virtually all, of the city size influence, may be explained indirectly in this manner. Thus, the local-cosmopolitan distinction aids in inter- preting the psychological process by which ur- ban experiences shape religious commitments. Data and Procedures Data permitting an analysis of the concep- tual model implicit in the previous discussions were available from a 1968 Episcopal Church survey in North Carolina. Mail questionnaires were sent to 890 adult church members, se- lected from the diocesan newsletter list by means of systematic sampling procedures. Be- cause newsletters are mailed to all members without subscription, this procedure yielded a random sample from the diocese. Usable ques- tionnaires were returned by 518 respondents, resulting in a response rate of 60 percent (dis- counting 28 errors in listing due to deaths and moves). Although the response rate is low, a subsequent short questionnaire returned by 91 non-respondents revealed only negligible differences in background characteristics be- tween respondents and non-respondents.2 As would be expected, Episcopalians are characterized by high socioeconomic status, professional occupations and above-average education. The general sample characteristics are as follows: 59% female, 55% under fifty years of age, 58% professional or managerial and 53% college graduates. Sample representa- tiveness of Episcopalians nationally is not easily determined, although the North Caro- linians appear to be generally comparable. For example, 44 percent of the sample were previ- ously members of other denominations, as compared with 45 percent in a 1965 NORC 2 With respect to sex, age, community size and occupation, the percentage differences between respondents and non-respondents are no greater than 2 percent. Respondents were slightly more educated (28% returning the short, non-respondent question- naire indicated no college as compared to 25% of the respondents).</page><page sequence="6">200 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Episcopal sample (cf. Stark and Glock, 1968: 195). Of greater issue is the southern sample. Seventy percent are Southerners by birth. Pre- sumably religion in the South-at least the popular religious culture-is distinguishable for its visibility, conservatism and orthodoxy (cf. Hill, 1972; Fichter and Maddox, 1965). Whether region systematically biases the ac- tual relations among the variables under study is difficult to say. This possibility cannot be ruled out with the data at hand; however, several recent studies suggest that southern versus non-southern differences in the basic patterns of religious commitment may not be as great as sometimes assumed (see Gibbs et al., 1973; Hoge and Carroll, 1973). In any event, data analysis procedures were chosen with the possibilities of sample bias in mind. Since my purpose was to assess the local-cosmpolitan model linking education, community size and individual religiosity, multiple regression was selected as the pri- mary mode of analysis. In addition to Simon- Blalock procedures of partial correlation, path analysis is used for decomposing zero-order re- lations into direct, indirect and joint associa- tion parts. Partial regression coefficients are less sensitive than correlations to skewed sam- ple characteristics, and thus should yield more reliable estimates of the actual relations among variables. Obviously, interval scale as- sumptions become necessary for such analysis, but the analytical advantages accruing to these procedures should compensate for any negli- gible measurement errors that may be intro- duced. Measures and Model The major exploratory variable, local com- munity reference, was measured by a mul- tiple-item scale. The scale items, previously used by Dobriner (1958) and Dye (1963), are as follows: (1) Despite all the newspaper and TV coverage, national and international hap- penings rarely seem as interesting as events that occur in the local community in which one lives. (2) Big cities may have their place but the local community is the backbone of Ameri- ca. (3) When it comes to choosing someone for a responsible public office in my commun- ity, I prefer a person whose family is known and well-established locally. (4) The most rewarding organizations a person can belong to are the large, state and nation-wide associations rather than local community clubs and activities. These items were randomly distributed in the questionnaire, and respondents were asked whether they strongly agreed, agreed, dis- agreed or strongly disagreed with each. Agree responses to the first three items were inter- preted as localistic references, as were dis- agreements with the fourth item. Responses were summated according to Likert pro- cedures, following an item analysis indicating reasonable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .8 1). Scale scores range from 4 to 16, with the distribution only slightly skewed to- ward low localistic scores as reflected in a mean value of 9.21.3 A check revealed only slight acquiescence effects, thus providing ad- ditional assurance of the scale's validity and reliability.4 3 Scale scores are sums of the individual item scores. Where there are missing data, in this and the other summated scale (i.e., religious orthodoxy), in- tegers nearest the mean values are substituted. This should not be a serious source of bias, however, since the mean percent of missing data for all questions is less than 2 percent. I An estimate of acquiescence effect was ob- tained by comparing responses to the fourth item in the localism measure with those to the other three, to see if there are any significant differences in how they predict other variables. Presumably, such an ef- fect should show up between statements positively and negatively stated. The standard deviation for the fourth item is slightly less than the average of the others (.848 and .941, respectively), and this item predicts less well. However, the differences among items are small and are always in the inverse direc- tion as expected. No doubt some acquiescence oc- curs, but it is unlikely that it substantially alters the findings. Acquiescence effects, and social desirability response sets generally, are more of a problem with lower income, poorly educated respondents. Given the present sample, response sets of this kind should be less serious.</page><page sequence="7">TRADITIONAL RELIGION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 201 For the other independent variables, the following measures were used. Education is in- dexed by the number of years a respondent attended school. Length of residence in the present community is measured in years, rang- ing from less than a year to over 40 years. Community size was indicated on a seven category rural-urban continuum, ranging from "farm" to "city of 250,000 to one million persons." Five measures of religiosity were included in the analysis. Three of these refer to socio- religious group involvement, or participation, and two others pertain to personal beliefs and practices. The measures are as follows: Church Attendance-the frequency of at- tendance at Sunday worship services. Religious Organizations-the number of church groups (e.g., choirs, men's clubs, study groups) in which the respondent regularly participates. Co ngregational Friendships-out of the four closest friends, the number who be- long to the same congregation. Doctrinal Orthodoxy-scale consisting of orthodox responses about God, Jesus, Heaven and Hell, and the Bible.5 The coef- ficient of homogeneity (Cronbach's alpha = .78) suggests a reasonable degree of intern- al consistency. 5 The scale items (starred responses indicating traditional, orthodox beliefs) are: 1. God is: *(a) a powerful and sometimes wrathful judge of man's behavior *(b) a personal Being who watches over and cares for our lives *(c) the creator and ruler of the universe (d) the beauty and majesty of nature (e) that part of each person which is bas- ically good (f) a kind of higher power or force in the world (g) ultimate or unconditional love 2. Jesus: *(a) Jesus was divine in the sense that he was in fact God living among men *(b) Jesus was divine in the sense that while he was only a man, he was uniquely called by God to reveal God's purpose to the world Devotionalism-scale combining responses regarding frequency of personal prayer and Bible reading. Product-moment correlation between the two is .52. Table 1 shows the zero-order correlations among all variables. The coefficients are gener- ally weak, but the patterns fall into place as expected. As was found in previous research on Southern Baptists (Roof, 1972), local com- munity reference is positively associated with all five religiosity measures. Community size is inversely related, and education is positive with religious involvement but negative with doctrinal orthodoxy and devotionalism. More important for our purposes here, however, are the proposed causal relations among variables. Figure 1 summarizes these relations in the form of a path diagram. In keeping with the theoretical discussion, local community reference is shown as intervening between the exogenous variables and religios- ity. Shown as well are the numerical coeffici- ents describing the relations among the exo- genous variables, and between these and local community reference. These latter depict localism as dependent upon three variables: education, community size and length of resi- (c) Jesus was divine in the sense that he embodied the best that is in all men (d) Jesus was a great man and teacher, but I would not call him divine (e) Frankly, I'm not entirely sure there really was such a person 3. Bible: *(a) The Bible was written by men in- spired by God, but it contains factual errors *(b) The Bible is God's Word and all that it says is factually true (c) The Bible is valuable because it was written by wise and good men, but God has no more to do with it than he did with other great literature 4. Heaven and Hell: *(a) physical places where all men live af- ter judgment by God (b) simply words that are used to express final rewards or punishments (c) ways of speaking about man's ac- ceptance of, or separation from, God.</page><page sequence="8">202 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 1.

Education and community size are treated as exogenous for reasons already cited, owing primarily to their liberalizing effects upon people's orientations. Length of resi- dence in the present community is included, given Kasarda and Janowitz's finding (1974) that it is a stronger determinant of local social bonds than any of the demographic or socio- economic status variables they studied. Like- wise, the results shown here support that con- clusion. What, finally, should be the effects of the variables in the model on religiosity? If the loc al-co smopolitan hypothesis holds, the major influence of the exogenous variables should be transmitted via broadened social or- ientations. Also, education should have both direct and indirect influence (see Figure 1). R.

These results, not shown in the path diagram, are issues for the remaining investigation. Results Shown first in Table 2 are partial correla- tions providing a test of local community reference as an intervening variable. Con- trolling in this instance should, if the model is correctly specified, result in attenuated rela- tionships between all three background fact- ors and religiosity. Education is expected to reduce less, of course, given that we anticipate direct, as well as indirect effects. The partials are largely consistent with the predictions. Controlling for community refer- ence, the correlations between length of resi- dence and four of the religiosity measures at- tenuate almost to zero. The pattern for com- munity size is essentially the same with the religious participation measures. Holding con- stant the intervening effects via localism- cosmopolitanism, these modest negative rela- tionshps are reduced to negligible. Though the partials for orthodoxy and devotionalism are reduced, the associations do not disappear. Traditional religious beliefs and private devo- tional activities are disproportionately found in rural and small-town settings, even with the intervening effects removed. Of greater interest are the findings for edu- cation. Controlling for the intervening variable here should attenuate the relationships provid- ing that both education and local community reference have similar signs. This is true for orthodoxy and devotionalism, and in both in- stances there is some reduction. As education increases, religious commitments of this kind decline-whether as a result of expanded social outlook or because of higher social stat- us. But with the religious dimensions that are positively associated with education (i.e., church attendance, organizational participa- tion and congregational friendships), con- trolling for local community reference pro- duces partials larger than total correlations. By removing the negative influence, educa- tion's direct, positive impact is maximized. This suggests in actuality that education ex- erts mixed effects on religious participation, both positive and negative. Not only are both operating, but the results suggest that the two counter one another in such a way as to pro- duce zero-order correlations that are decep- tively small. To examine this further, we turn to a re- gression analysis of the simultaneous effects of the several independent variables. The model predicts that religiosity should be di- rectly responsive only to local community ori- entation and level of education. This is tested by including all four independent variables in</page><page sequence="10">204 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 3.

Results of this analysis are reported in Table 3. Controlling for all independent effects, we find regression coefficients in support of the theoretical predictions. Direct effects of length of residence are quite small, suggesting that its major influence on religiosity is trans- mitted indirectly. The same holds true for community size, except in the case of ortho- doxy where there is a sizeable direct effect. Their lack of statistical significance is, of course, supportive of the hypothesis. By far, education and local community reference ex- ert the major influences. As education levels increase, socio-religious group participation goes up, and orthodoxy and devotionalism go down. As attachments to the local community rise, the religiosity scores increase on all five dimensions. Local community attachments are a strong- er predictor of socio-religious group participa- tion than education but, with orthodoxy and devotionalism, the two predictors are about equal. This is not surprising considering the differing aspects of religiosity these measures tap. Church attendance, organizational ac- tivity and friendships within congregations, are measures either of associational or com- munal involvement, both of which are highly sensitive to primary-group norms. Because locals tend to have stronger friendship and kinship bonds within their communities, they experience greater pressures to participate in socio-religious group activities. By contrast, orthodox beliefs and devotional practices are personal, more subjective, indicators of re- ligious commitment, and are probably less re- sponsive to local social influences. Such differ- ences underscore the importance of distin- guishing between social versus private types of religious commitment. As a final check on the model, the zero- order correlations are decomposed into direct and indirect causal effects, plus joint associa- tion due to the independent variable's covaria- tion with other antecedent variables that in- fluence religiosity. Decomposition permits us to see more clearly how each of the indepen- dent variables may be operating along all pos- sible causal paths. Also, it provides estimates of the actual effect parameters as distinct from spurious or unanalyzed components, which possibly are included in the zero-order associations. Table 4 presents the direct and indirect ef- fects and joint associations computed for all five religious dimensions. The indirect effects represent that portion of the total association, of course, which intervenes via localism-</page><page sequence="11">TRADITIONAL RELIGION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 205 Table 4.

This table reveals, generally, indirect effects stronger than direct for both length of residence and community size. While attention to the direct effects only would lead one to infer that these variables have negli- gible influence, the indirect effects show that by influencing an individual's community reference orientation, they have somewhat greater impact. These indirect effects occur primarily because small-size communities, and extended periods of residence within com- munities of all sizes, facilitate and nurture local social bonds. Once again, we observe that the association between community size and orthodoxy devi- ates from the others. Direct effects are some- what stronger here than the indirect effects. Although this inversion may have resulted from measurement error, it probably reveals the model's lack of fit. Recall, from the previ- ous discussion on community size that religi- ous beliefs are more sensitive than socio-re- ligious group participation to rural-urban dif- ferences. The intervening causal model is, in this instance, a poor approximation of the ac- tual empirical patterns. Education differs considerably from the other two background variables, both in terms of its strength of association with religion as well as its causal patterns. The direct and in- direct effects are brought into clearer focus in Table 4. Note that in all five instances, educa-</page><page sequence="12">206 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW tion's direct effects are substantial. But ob- serve also, that education generates opposing indirect effects upon socio-religious group par- ticipation. This latter influence is by no means large but, relative to the total effect, it is sub- stantively important. Because the influence is negative, it neutralizes a portion of educa- tion's positive influence. Consequently, educa- tion would have a much larger "status" effect were it not the case that cosmopolitanism, al- so dependent on education, tends to under- mine traditional religious plausibility. Hence, we observe here that direct effects are larger than the total correlations. With the two measures of personal religious commitment, on the other hand, both effects are negative, and thus the direct and indirect influences combined with the joint association sum in the same direction to reproduce the original association. In brief, the decomposition of the per- tinent correlations supports the proposed model of local community attachments and their effects on religious commitment. It shows that the influence of education, length of residence and community size can be re- presented by means of this intervening mechanism. Analytically, the findings illus- trate how an orientational variable aids in in- terpreting subtle, and inherently complex, forces that shape styles of religiosity. Of course, one must be cautious not to in- fer too much. The empirical associations are weak to begin with, the extent of measure- ment error unknown and the sample probably restricts variation in the exogenous variables. But, taken as a whole, the results of Tables 2, 3 and 4 clearly indicate that local-cosmo- politan orientations function as an important intervening variable in understanding both demographic and social status correlates of re- ligiosity. They underscore, repeatedly, the fact that local community bonds play a sig- nificant part in determining if an individual finds traditional religious beliefs and participa- tion plausible in his or her everyday life. Conclusions This analysis prompts several conclusions pertinent to developing more systematic ex- planations for religious commitment. These generally call for a conception of traditional religion essentially as a subculture rather than as the normative basis of modern society. Ap- proached from this perspective, we gain in- sight about the social location of religion in society currently, and we are better able to interpret its changing forms and functions. Generally, the findings provide support for a local-cosmopolitan theory of religious com- mitment. It was observed that local commun- ity attachments undergird both socio-religious group participation and personal beliefs and practices. This holds even when simultaneous controls are enforced for the other indepen- dent variables, except in one instance-devo- tionalism. Why this is an exception, perhaps, is explained by the "instrumentalization" of such activity-for example, reading inspira- tional literature in order to obtain psychic bene fits-and its increasing independence from other forms of institutional religiosity (see Luckmann, 1967). But generally, for pat- terns of church religion it is evident that local social bonds do constitute an important plausibility structure in contemporary Ameri- can society. Such a theoretical scheme focuses atten- tion upon sub-sectors of society, not the total society, as the social basis for church religion today. Previous research has emphasized other spheres such as the family and the ethnic group as a context of religious meaning. In much the same way as these, the local com- munity in modern mass society offers an in- dividual opportunities for nurturing and main- taining the "private" life, set aside and some- what distinct from the public sectors of soci- ety. Institutional church-type religion, both as a belief system and as a set of organized ritu- als, retains greater plausibility within these private, more restricted sectors and no doubt functions to symbolize and legitimate tradi- tional values and life-styles. Specifically, the conceptual model bears implications for a number of issues important to the empirical study of religion. One con- cerns the study of the social correlates of re- ligious commitment. Rather than look at the</page><page sequence="13">TRADITIONAL RELIGION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 207 correlates separately, the findings suggest there may be an advantage in linking sets of variables into a single explanatory model. In this instance, education, length of residence and community size are subsumed under the rubric of plausibility, thus linking macro- and micro-level variables together into a general theory of religious change. By no means is it a complete theory of change, but it does pro- vide a parsimonious interpretation of some of the processes involved. My effort in this re- spect to construct a more systematic, multi- variate model resembles Glock et al.'s earlier deprivation theory (1967) and Lazerwitz's more recent ethnic correlates (1973). Another implication concerns the study of secularization as a social psychological pro- cess. The influences of social status upon re- ligious affiliation and participation, often de- scribed in American society, appear to be par- tially offset by the declining plausibility of religious commitment. These patterns are brought out by means of the direct and in- direct effects of education on religion, es- pecially in the case of socio-religious group participation. As the society becomes more secular, socioeconomic status may become even less important as a correlate. At the very least, distinguishing between the "status" and "plausibility" consequences of education is crucial in formulating more precise explana- tions of religious change. Further research should be directed at rep- licating the local-cosmopolitan theory, using data from other religious groups, as well as for other dimensions of religiosity. The present analysis is obviously exploratory and limited in its generalizability. Nevertheless, it repre- sents, hopefully, a step forward in developing a general theory of religious commitment based upon considerations other than depriva- tion or socialization.
