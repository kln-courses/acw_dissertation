<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 21, Gower Street, London, W.C.1, on March 21st, 1927, at 8 P.M. X.-SYMPOSIUM: ERROR. By GERALD CATOR, C. E. M. JOAD, and H. J. PATON. I. By GERALD CATOR. I1 n'y saurait etre question que du profit intellectuel, et par la J'ecartele Pragmatisme. (Paulhan, Logique de la contradiction, p. 126.) Everything is real, so long as we do not take it for what it is not. (Bosan- quet, Logic, Vol. I, p. 273.) THERE is a certain penny which has the same sort of prescriptive right to be used as the example when we, in this Society, discuss questions of appearance and reality, as velvet and champagne had to typify luxuries in the writings of the political economists. I am, I trust, too loyal an Aristotelian to break with this tradition. Let us try, therefore, to discover the real penny. Imagine the penny to be fixed at the centre of an imaginary sphere of infinite radius. Place yourself first on the radius per- pendicular to the plane of the penny, so as to look at it full face. While you are too close the penny will look a transparent blur with a rim, but as you withdraw you will soon reach a position of best visibility and will see what Colonel Bogey-I propose that we adopt him as the concrete representative of the overworked " plain " or " average " man-calls the real penny, the penny as it really is. From this position outwards the penny as a visible object is, disregarding consequent changes in the visibility and definition of the markings, a simple function of the distance. Colonel Bogey's penny, the penny as seen under normal conditions by normal eyes from some one privileged position on T</page><page sequence="2">214 GERALD CATOR. this radius, is displaced from its position as the real penny by what I will call the penny as a concrete universal of the first order-the penny as seen from any position along this radius. Other universals of the first order may be obtained to express the peny along all other radii. The combination of all these first universals into a formula, which will express the penny from any distance and in any direction, will be a universal of the second order. Here we pause to notice an important result, namely, that here, disregarding, of course, any other aspects than shape and colour, we have exhausted the possibilities-we know the penny from all possible positions-and this is an important step towards the real penny. Suppose now that the same process is continued till, in a universal of the highest possible order, we have expressed the penny under all possible conditions and in all possible relations with all possible objects. Here at last, here and not in the penny as seen from a privileged position, nor in something lurking inaccessible behind a screen of appearances, we shall have the real penny set in its place in the real universe. In this last universal, which not only as a matter of fact, but, since it would exhaust possibility, also as a matter of theory, would be that than which no greater can be conceived, every aspect of reality, from the most momentous down to the most trifling and evanescent, would have its proper place and in that place would be essential to the whole. Common-sense objects (pots and pans, acorns, lumps of sugar, and the like), fictitious objects (the characters and events in Ivanhoe), objects of superstition, anthropomorphism or animism; objects of delirium or mania, scientific objects (atoms and elec- trons), religious objects (souls, angels). Each of these sorts of objects has its rights, and each of them has its duties; the Creator as Creator, the creature as creature, the necessary as</page><page sequence="3">ERROR. 215 necessary, the contingent as contingent, the important as important, the trifling as trifling. Now, it would seem at first look as if (a) a mind of infinite capacity would be able to utter no definite judgments. For instance, such a mind could not pronounce anything about the real shape of the penny or the real colour of a piece of cloth. All its judgments would be in the form that the penny (or the cloth} is such as to appear as of such and such a shape/colour under such and such conditions. This is a mistake. As regards the penny in the universal of the second order, the whole set of its appearances would be different from the corresponding set of, say, a cube. An intelligence, therefore, thinking in universals of the second order would be able to make categorical judgments about a penny NOTE.-Hoffding, Der Menschliche Gedanke, p. 114, writes:-" We cannot lay down any rule as to how comprehensive a totality of experience a particular experience must be incorporated in, in order to be entitled to be adjudged real. " The world of experience expands continuously and cannot be kept within prescribed limits. " The concept of actuality or of existence is, therefore, paradoxical as. it may sound, the concept of an ideal. To be in a position to make, in respect of any particular experience, an absolutely secure predication of actuality, we should have to be in a position to co-ordinate this experience with all other possible experiences, and this, of course, is not possible." I hold, on the contrary, that in certain respects it is possible. (1) The hierarchy of more and more comprehensive and exacting constructions of reality does not go on to infinity. It culminates in " Id quo majus cogitari nequit." (2) In respect of some of its characters, those which are plausibly repre- sented by the indemonstrable first principles of Thomist scholasticism, bright shoots of everlastingness, our experience is infinite and irreformable from the first. (3) The Theistic construction of reality is not only a possible con- struction, it is the ouly possible construction, because it is the only one in which everything is able to be what it is and to avoid being what it is not. May I refer to an old paper of mine for an elaboration of these positions, " Id quo majus," etc. (The Monist, October, 1908). T 2</page><page sequence="4">216 GERALD CATOR. as distinguished from a cube. And the same would hold of every higher order of universals. (b) We should be able to take no side in any dispute, but should always have to say something fatuous, such as " there are faults on both sides," " the accused is innocent from one point of view and guilty from another." Or, again, there would seem to be no reason for preference between two travellers disputing whether the object on the roadside ahead of them is really a robber or a bush. My theory of error is designed to avoid this inconvenient consequence while retaining the comprehensivist theory of real- ness. The suppositions with which I operate are:- (1) That there is an absolute intellectual good which consists --in the ideal possession of the whole system of reality. Sub- ordinate intellectual goods are stages on the way to this supreme good. Propositions are true so far as they promote, false so far as they hinder the mind's movement towards the good, abstracting from collateral moral, spiritual, emotional, or practical effects. (2) That though any significant assertion is of its own nature capable of being made the starting-point of a dialectical process culminating in the possession of this supreme good, yet not all starting-points are equally favourable. Let me illustrate this in two ways, each of which has some advantages. Even though " all roads lead to Rome," it does not follow that all roads are equally practicable. If the journey to Rome by some one road would need for its completion the expenditure of more physical energy than a traveller had at command, then he would never get to Rome by that road. It is the same NOTE.-By using the Leibnitzian infinite analysis of contingent truths I can provide for roads by which no traveller, however endowed, would ever get to Rome, though he would always be approaching it.</page><page sequence="5">ERROR. 217 with the Itinerarium mentis ad Deum, but here, of course, it is insufficient command of psychical energy that is in question. The propositions which mark the entrances into impracticable roads are errors. A perfect map of England would show every detail, but such a map would be as big as the country itself. If some smaller scale is imposed by circumstances, then some details must be sacrificed, and the only question is which. Similarly, with the intellectual representation of reality. The scope of our minds does not admit of full-scale representation of it. If we sacrifice the more central and important features for the benefit of the less important, we fall into error because we retard ourselves. Two men disputing as to whether a shield is black or white are each of them partly right and partly wrong. Each of them. is right about the colour of one side of the shield and wrong about- the other side, and as neither side is more important than the other, neither disputant has, on balance, any advantage over the other. The two travellers disputing about "bush" or "robbery" are also each of them partly right and partly wrong, but in this case the honours are not equally divided. The correct formula would be " such as to present the appearance of a bush under such and such conditions of illumination and of nerves, and the- appearance of a robber under such and such other conditions of illuminations and nerves." If the object is taken as a bush, a relatively short and easy way is opened to incorporate it into that common-sense construction NOTE.-We may choose as we like to say " is under certain conditions" or " presents the appearance of under certain conditions " so long as having chosen our locution, we stick to it consistently. What we must not do is to fall into Bogeyism and to say that the object is what it appears as under, what we choose to regard as normal conditions and only appears to be what it is under abnormal conditions.</page><page sequence="6">218 GERALD CATOR. of reality, which in its turn leads easily and naturally on to the Theistic construction of reality. If, on the other hand, the object is taken as a robber, it has to be regarded as a robber of a very peculiar kind-one, namely, which has the property of turning into a bush by day or when closely approached. If we enter on this way the complications soon become practically insupportable. I will not attempt anything like an enumeration of the causes why some starting positions are more favourable than others, some of them may depend on the original constitution of the human mind, others on acquired habits of thought. One chief reason is what I call the confusion of personalities. The common-sense construction of reality, the world of qualified (primarily material) things related externally in time and space, is developed almost without effort by the spontaneous intelligence in the service of the active life. There it is and there it remains. As a consequence of this preoccupation it pays the philosopher, pays him intellectually, to keep on friendly terms with the plain man within him, and not to admit complications and elaborations into his scheme till his alter ego is ready to receive them without being scandalized. The speculative army of occupation in each of our minds cannot hope to extirpate the aboriginal plain man. Instead, there- fore, of wasting our none too ample resources on a necessarily fruitless policy of repression, let us change our tactics and go in wholeheartedly for conciliation. Let me revert to the roads to Rome illustration. NOTE.-Meyerson, in his important work, " Identite et Realite," p. 339, says: " Directly we press our enquiries a little the world of common sense shows itself as what it is in fact, a first and very crude sketch of a scientific and metaphysical system." NOTE.-" Unus homo sustinet plures personas," the mind of a man is a committee of mindlets. Colonel Bogey and the speculative philosopher are two of these personalities.</page><page sequence="7">ERROR. 219 If the philosopher chooses one way he will have to exhaust himself in dragging his inseparable companion, kicking and struggling, with him. If he chooses another way, one which will lead him to the same goal, the plain man will readily agree to accompany him " as far as to the horizon"; and as they journey amicably side by side the horizon will recede and recede. It is a simple question of tactics. Our problem is essentially a housewife's problem. We have to lay out our endowment of psychical energy as economically as possible. Jf we do we shall appropriately gain a good house- wife's reward. We shall live intellectually in a world where there is a place for everything and where everything is in its place. NOTE ON THE CASE OF GALILEO.-SO far as I know, the seed- of the theory I have just expounded was sown in my mind by a remark of New- man's made, I think, in connection with the case of Galileo. I quote from memory. " Truth is error to those who are unprepared for it, because of the refraction with which it enters their minds." If the theologians who condemned Galileo did so because in their minds the two propositions: (1) The Earth is theologically the centre of the universe; (2) the Earth is astronomically not the centre of the universe- were incompossible, they acted rightly in point of logical Irincipl3 (see Bradley, " Principle of Logic," second edition, Terminal Essay, II1). These theologians were intellectually i.i the same position as is morally a man with a false conscience; he did one wrong to come by it, h- would do another if he disregarded it while it persists. For the same reason, the ru3tic who is reported to have looked solemnly at the giraffe and to have said, " I don't believe it," did right. The argument from esse to posse can be met by the counter argument from non-po3se tc non-esse.</page><page sequence="8">220 C. E. M. JOAD. II. By C. E. M. JOAD. (I.) I confess that I find difficulty in understanding Mr. Cator's paper, mainly because I do not know what he means by his terms. Terms like "absolute intellectual good " and "ideal possession of the whole system of reality " are to me practically meaningless, or, rather, they are capable of bearing so many different meanings that, until I know which of these meanings Mr. Cator wishes us to attach to them, I am afraid I shall run the risk of seriously misunderstanding him. All that I can do, therefore, is to proceed upon the basis of what I think he is, on the whole, mostly likely to mean, and to criticize him from that standpoint, bearing in mind the fact that it may be an illegitimate standpoint. I assume, then, that by his proposition (1) on page 216 he wishes to assert that truth is an absolute intellectual good, which consists in the ideal possession of the whole system of reality, and I assume this because if it is not truth that he is here writing about, I am at a loss to know what this absolute intellectual good is, or why it should be mentioned. This assertion seems to me to be open to the following objec- tions: (a) Nobody that we know is in ideal possession of the whole system of reality; it follows, therefore, that nobody knows what this intellectual good which is identified with truth is. If it is unknown to us, we cannot know what it is like or what it is not like. Since then we are ignorant of its position and nature, we cannot tell when we are moving towards it and when away from it. Now, a true proposition is, according to</page><page sequence="9">ERROR. 221 Mr. Cator, one that promotes the mind's movement towards this intellectual good. If, then, we do not know whether on any given occasion this movement is or is not taking place, we do not know and cannot know of any proposition whether it is true. In other words, we have no criterion of truth. Now, it is quite clear that there is some sense in which it is true to say that the whole is larger than the part, or that Caasar crossed the Rubicon; there is also a further sense in which we know that it is true to say these things. In abolishing the criterion of truth, therefore, Mr. Cator makes no provision for the fact that we know that some propositions are true in a sense in which their contraries are false. (b) If the nature of truth is unknown to us, we cannot know that any of Mr. Cator's propositions are true. In his proposition (2) he suggests that some propositions are truer than others (I presume this is what he mieans by saying that some starting- points for dialectical process are more favourable than others), and implies, therefore, a belief in degrees of truth. That one proposi- tion is truer than another may, of course, be the case, but, if it is we can never, on Mr. Cator's premises, know that it is. You can only measure the comparative distances of two points on a road from a goal if you know what and where the goal is. If Mr. Cator does not know what his absolute intellectual good is, then he cannot know with regard to any one starting-point that it is nearer to it or more favourable as a point of approach to it than another. Thus any candidate for the r6le of being a favourable starting-point could always be disqualified by the assertion that the ideal possession of reality was something quite different from what Mr. Cator supposes, and, since Mr. Cator cannot tell us what this ideal possession is like, he would have no success in maintaining his selected favourable starting-point against a person who insisted on a contrary proposition as his starting- point.</page><page sequence="10">22 2 C. E. M. JOAD. In this connection it should be noted that the analogy in which Mr. Cator makes use of the statement " all roads lead to Rome" is not applicable to the case in point. He truly points out that although all roads do lead to Rome, some are shorter and easier than others. But we only know them to be so because, having already been to Rome, we can compare the merits of the various ways of getting there. If we had not been to Rome and did not know where or what Rome was, we should not know either that some starting-points were more favourable than others, or, if some were in fact more favourable, which the more favourable were. It follows that even if there is some meaning in saying one proposition is truer than another, we cannot in our ignorance of the truth know what that meaning is or which is in fact the truer. (c) I showed in (b) that, if Mr. Cator's propositions are true, we cannot know that they are. But we can go further and assert that they are not true. Statements about the nature of truth are not the " ideal possession of the whole system of reality." Therefore, since this and nothing short of it is what truth is, they are not true. Nothing, indeed, which is not this ideal possession of the whole is, if Mr. Cator is right, wholly true. Therefore Mr. Cator is not wholly right, but partly wrong. Therefore it is partly false that truth is " the ideal possession of the whole system of reality." The above difficulties spring, in my view, from certain funda- mental errors in Mr. Cator's position. Of these the following are the most important: (a) In identifying truth with an absolute good he makes it unknown and, for all practical purposes and finite beings, unknowable. In so doing he (1) overlooks the fact that quite humble truths, such as that 2 + 2 =_ 4, are not only true, but are known to be true, and (2) implicitly denies the possi. bility of any human knowledge being true. If no human know- ledge is true, the distinction between truth and error is obscured,</page><page sequence="11">ERROR. 223 and, since the doctrine of degrees of truth cannot, as I have shown, be, on Mr. Cator's premises, sustained, it seems to follow that everything is both true and false. (b) Mr. Cator appears to hold that a test of truth is to be found in the fact that what tends to be or is on the way to being true gives mental or moral satisfaction. I infer this (i) from the discussion about the robber and the bush from which it emerges, that the object is to be regarded as more really a bush because as such we can " incorporate it into that common-sense construction of reality, which in its turn leads easily and naturally on to the Theistic construction of reality." (ii) From his description of truth as an intellectual good. (iii) From the reference to Pragmatism at the head of the paper. The difficulties to which the Pragmatic theory of truth is exposed are too well known to be recapitulated here. In the sense in which Mr. Cator seems to hold it, it ignores the fact that many propositions give neither mental nor moral satisfaction, yet are indubitably true in a sense in which their pleasing con- traries are false. Such propositions are, " I have just missed my train," " I have lost all my money," " I am about to visit the dentist." (c) He makes truth subjective by establishing its dependence upon the constitution of the human mind. This follows from his identification of greater truth with more favourable starting- points for dialectical processes, more favourable, that is, to the human mind, and his assertion that what determines a favourable starting-point may be a habit of thought. If, then, my habits of thought are different from AMr. Cator's, different starting-points will appear to each of us to be the most favourable, and what is true for me will be untrue for him. For monkeys, who may be assumed to possess a " different original " constitution of the mind, propositions will be true which for men</page><page sequence="12">224 C. E. M. JOAD. are false. Thus, on Mr. Cator's view, it might be true that from some points of view, e.g., from the monkey's, 2 + 2 = 5. Considerations of this kind are obviously applicable to what we think true; but we fall into grave error if we suppose them to have any bearing on the question, what is true. That there is a distinction between what we think true and what is true is obvious (if there were not, there would be no such thing as error); that what we think true depends in part, perhaps wholly, upon our temperaments, our wishes and the constitutions of our minds is equally obvious. But, if the distinction is to be main- tained, it is clear that what I think true cannot possibly have any bearing upon what is true. I may think propositions true because they are; they are not true because I think them so. I wish, therefore, to emphasize the point that what is true, as opposed to what is thought true, is not dependent for being so upon the constitution, disposition, interests, proclivities of any mind or minds whatever, but upon something external and other than the mind which asserts the proposition which is claiming to be true. (II.) I can most conveniently expand this statement by starting with what Mr. Cator says about the penny. I think there is some confusion in his account of what we see when we look at a penny, which arises from his belief that there is such a thing as a real penny " set in its place in the real universe," such that other pennies which are seen from less comprehensive points of view are somehow not real, or are less real than the real penny. (Per- sonally, I do not know what is meant by the suggestion that one thing can be more real than ano-jh2r. If a thing, whether penny or universe, exists, it is real, and nothing that exists can be either more or less real than it.) In opposition to this view I should maintain that there is no such thing as a real penny, either in the common sense or in the</page><page sequence="13">ERROR. 225 absolutist sense; what there is is a system of distinct but similar sense data to which we give the name of penny. In questions of perception I start from the assuLmption, which I cannot here defend, that what you see is not the same as your seeing; nor, indeed, does your seeing, taken as a mental act, contribute to or affect what you see. (The medium constituted by the physiological apparatus by means of which you see-that is, your eyes, your visual chords and the nerve centres in the brain-does contribute to and affect what you see; but this point does not concern our present issue.) Now, it is true that, from whatever point of view you look at the penny, you see something different; it follows, therefore, that there is a some- thing different to be seen from that point. This something is in each case a brown patch of a certain size and shape, and a different patch is seen from each point of observation. The system of the brown patches which are seen from all possible points of obser- vation is the penny; but that does not mean that there is a unified source or archetypal penny, as it were, behind the brown patches, of which each brown patch is a different aspect. The patches are not the common-sense penny for the reason that, if I look at a penny a yard away and a halfpenny an inch away, the brown patch which I see and which I call the half- penny will be larger than the brown patch which I see and which I call the penny. Yet the common-sense penny is larger than the common-sense halfpenny. The reason for denying the existence of the common-sense penny as a persistent entity behind the brown patches is that you never in experience meet with it. When you try to do so all that you in fact come across is more brown patches of different sizes and shapes. I have given this analysis of the occurrence which is known as seeing a penny because there follows from it a certain view of perception upon which the theory of truth which I wish to advocate depends. The view of p6rception is as follows:-The</page><page sequence="14">226 C. E. M. JOAD. relation of the object which we perceive (the object always being analysable into a set of sense data) to the mind is o;ne of direct presentation. The mind is aware, that is to say, of a directly presented sense datum. The relationship between the mind and that of which it is aware is always the same; it is the same whether the object is perceived or is thought about, the difference between perceiving and thinking being not a difference between mental activities, but a difference between the objects of which the mind is aware. Objects of which we are aware in thinking are variously known as subsistent objects, objects of thought, or concepts; they are never the same as the objects we perceive (this follows from the fact that what I perceive when I see a penny is a brown sense datum, but what I think about is nothing of the kind), but they are no more mental than the objects of perception. The assertion of the non-mental character of objects of thought follows from the assumption made above, that that which you perceive is never the same as your perceiving; if this assumption is valid as regards objects of sense, it is equally valid, and valid for the same reasons as regards objects of thought. It seems to me essential for any satisfactory theory of truth and error to emphasize these two points, first, that the relation- ship of the mind to its object is always the same, and, secondly, that this relationship is one of direct awareness. The mind, in other words, contributes nothing to that of which it is aware; it does not construct it, distort it, manipulate it, or add to it. We perceive and think about everything just as it is, and there is no difference, therefore, between the object as known and the object before it is known. Failure to adhere closely to this position leads us into hopeless difficulties. If, for example, we were to admit with regard to any object we know that the mind may have contributed something to its nature, then we cannot stop short of the admission that the mind may have manufactured the whole of it. It is impossible to draw the line between those</page><page sequence="15">ERROR. 227 parts of what we see or know which we ourselves have con- structed or modified in the process of seeing or knowing, and those parts which we know as they are; hence we can never know of any part or aspect of the object that this part or aspect is not the result of mental projection or construction. Since, then (if we make this admission), any part of the reality which we think we truly apprehend may, for all we know to the contrary, be not the external world at all, but merely a product of our own thinking, it follows that we can never know reality as it is, or, to be exact, that we can never know that we do. This view leads to the difficulties (1) that if we can never truly know reality, we can never know that any proposition we make about it is true; (2) that, since all our judgments may on this view be false, in the sense that, although purporting to be about some- thing other than ourselves, they nevertheless fail to relate to anything outside ourselves, the distinction between truth and falsehood, so far as we are concerned, goes by the board. If, then, we refuse to make the admission in question and steadfastly adhere to the view that the mind contributes nothing to what it knows, two conclusions emerge: (i) Since the relation between mind and its object is always the same, the distinction between truth and falsehood cannot be a property of that relation. When we make a false judgment we know the object about which the judgment is made in pre- cisely the same way as we know the object of a true judgment. (ii) The objects which we know in dreams and hallucinations are just as real, are known in precisely the same way as, and are no more mental than the objects of our normal waking thoughts and perceptions. We are now in a position to state our theory of truth and error. (1) Truth is a property of judgment or propositions. The presence or absence of belief in the judgment made or proposition asserted has no bearing upon the question of its truth or falsehood.</page><page sequence="16">-228 C. E. M. JOAD. For thousands of years everybody believed in the truth of the proposition " the earth is flat," but the existence of this belief did not make the proposition true. The truth and falsity of propositions and judgments is, therefore, independent of belief; it is also independent of any mental attitude on the part of any mind or body of minds. (2) The content of a proposition is deter- mined in part by its opposite, the proposition " snow is white" being determined by the contrary proposition "snow is not white." If, therefore, the true proposition " snow is white " is objective and states a fact, the false proposition " snow is not white " must be equally objective and must also state a fact. (3) Since every- thing that we experience, including even the objects of hallucina- tion, exists, and since false propositions have objective validity and state facts, what meaning are we to assign to error ? Truth and falsehood, we say, are characteristics of judgments or propositions. Now, in judgment I do not assert anything about my own mental states (if I were to admit that I did, the difficulty mentioned above would apply, and I should never know that I judged about anything other than my own mental states); nor do I assert a correspondence between an idea of mine and reality (there are no such things as ideas, and unless we know reality the correspondence could not be made out. This is the difficulty of the old copying theory of truth). Therefore a judgment is always about one or more objects of thought, and it asserts that objects of thought stand or do not stand in certain relations to each other. (4) Objects of thought may or may not have physical counter- parts (we can put this, if we like, by saying they may or may not stand in a certain relationship to the concept of existence), but the physical counterparts, which are sense data, are never the same as the objects of thought. (5) A true judgment is one that asserts a relationship between objects of thought such that their physical counterparts stand to each other in the same relationship, as, for example, in the case</page><page sequence="17">ERROR. 229 of the judgment, Caesar crossed the Rubicon. This judgment asserts a specific connection between the conceptual objects Caesar and the Rubicon, and as the connection in question held between the physical counterparts of the conceptual objects in question, the judgment is true. The judgment, Alexander crossed the Rubicon, is false, because no relationship of the kind asserted ever held between the physical counterparts of the conceptual objects in question. Where the judgment makes an assertion about the qualities of a subsistent object, it will be true if the physical counterpart of the object of thought which forms the content of the proposition asserted, does possess the qaalities which the object of thought is stated to possess. Thus the pro- position, the grass is green, is true, because the object of thought which is the content of the proposition, namely, green grass, possesses a physical counterpart. The proposition, the earth is flat, is false, because there is no physical counterpart to the object of thought, flat earth. (6) In conclusion, I would like to emphasize three points. First, in order to maintain that the function of the mind in belief is limited to that of direct awareness, it is necessary to hold that- the proposition in which belief is asserted, whether true or false, always asserts a fact; it is of this fact that the mind is aware. Since, therefore, all propositions assert facts, the contents of false propositions are constituents of reality. Secondly, the facts which true beliefs assert are not physical facts, but are facts about objects of thought; nevertheless, that which makes the belief true is a fact not about the object of thought, but about its physical counterpart. Thirdly, the objects with regard to which a particular judgment or proposition actually asserts a relation- ship, being objects of thought are other than the objects about which we purport to make an assertion when we wish to assert something about objects of sense, that is, about the physical counterparts of the objects of thought. u</page><page sequence="18">230 H. J. PATON. III. By H. J. PATON. (I.) IT is easy to fall into error, but curiously difficult to know what error is. We can find examples of error on every side, and most of us will admit that we have fallen, and do fall, into error our- selves; yet, in spite of this superabundance of examples, and in spite of this intimate personal experience, we must allow that we are only too likely to fall into error as to what the nature of error is. It is a poor consolation to know that if we do so, we shall at least provide an example, although we cannot offer an explanation, of that reality or unreality which it is our business to describe. The discussion of this subject by Mr. Cator and Mr. Joad serves to bring out one truth (or truism)-that our theory of error must depend upon our theory of truth. Indeed, in their accounts, the theory of truth bulks much more largely than the theory of error, yet even so I have difficulty in understanding their different theories of truth, and, consequently, an even greater difficulty in understanding their different theories of error. I attribute this difficulty to the fact that their theories are in each case part of a wider philosophy whose nature I have in the main to surmise. If I fall into error about their different points of view, I shall attribute that error neither to my own incapacity for following, nor to theirs for setting forth, a philoso- p~hical argument-although it is possible that such considerations may enter in-but rather to the fact that we all understand any theory as part of a wider whole. Where we do not have the whole in its completeness, we must in some way go beyond our</page><page sequence="19">ERROR. 231 evidence, and so may, and perhaps must, fall into error both about the part and about the whole. None the less, it would be impossible to do so, unless we had apprehended in some degree both the part and the whole of which it is a part, or, in other words, unless we had attained to some limited kind of truth. This appears to me to be not merely the simplest explanation of my own errors in this connexion, but also the main principle which lies at the root of all human error. As finite beings, we are dealing with parts which we know to be parts of a whole, but since we cannot attain to the whole in its completeness, we are liable to fall into error in regard to the parts. None the less,, we could not fall into such error, unless we had some truth both about the parts and about the whole; and where we have a part. which is itself a rich and highly articulated, if still partial, whole (as in mathematics or empirical science or history or philosophy), we have reason to believe that we have a greater hold upon truth. The progress of truth among men is made as our thinking becomes more systematic, and as we grasp more thoroughly the coherent articulation of the universe as a whole of parts. It will be seen from this that I am in agreement with Mr. Cator as against Mr. Joad in what appears to me to be the main differ- ence between them. Mr. Cator recognizes that the real is a systematic whole, and that truth belongs to propositions in so&amp; far as they contribute to a systematic understanding of the universe; while Mr. Joad-or, so it seems to me-attempts to shiver truth and reality alike into a series or aggregate of isolated splinters. I propose, therefore, to say no more about Mr. Cator in the way of criticism, except this: firstly, that his account appears to me unnecessarily pragmatic; and, secondly, that to me it is not quite clear whether he regards advance in truth as the adding of one external thing to another or whether he regards it as a living and organic growth. If he regards truth as a mere aggregate or sum of truths, then it appears to me that Mr. Joad's</page><page sequence="20">232 H. Ja PATON. criticisms are unanswerable. If he does not, then the supposition behind Mr. Joad's criticisms becomes invalid, and the criticism itself (except in so far as its presuppositions can be established, as the only possible basis of a true philosophy) appears to me to be a mere ignoratio elenchi. (II.) It is more difficult for me to deal with Mr. Joad. In his case I am faced with perhaps the greatest differences which can divide philosophers. Broadly speaking, nearly all his pre- suppositions appear to me to be false, while his conclusions are incomprehensible. I propose to deal first with the presuppositions -or premises, and thereafter with the conclusions. Perhaps it would be well to begin with the only fundamental doctrine in which he and I are in at least partial agreement. On page 226 he says: " If, for example, we were to admit with regard to any object we know that the mind may have contributed something to its nature "-I presume that he means " its nature as known "-" then we cannot stop short of the admission that the mind may have manufactured the whole of it." This statement I believe to be true, although my interpretation of it would, I imagine, be somewhat different from that of Mr. Joad; and would certainly not mean that the object was manufactured by a momentary act of awareness, or even that it was manu- factured by a mind as an isolated thing in itself with a beginning and ending in time. If we set aside, however, the admittedly difficult question of interpretation, I affirm with confidence that as a matter alike of experience and of theory my previous thinking does make a difference to every object that I know, and does, therefore, contribute something to its nature. My under- standing of a poem or an argument manifestly depends on my previous experience and my prcvious thought, and-to take</page><page sequence="21">ERROR. 233 merely one side of it-on my knowledge of the language in which it is expressed, a knowledge obviously acquired through a long acquaintance. And this means that to me the object is a different object because of my previous history. Mr. Joad seems to prefer to consider only objects of a humbler kind, but the same truth holds, although in a less conspicuous degree, of humbler objects such as horses and motor-cars, and even, as we shall see in a moment, of what he calls sense-data. The mind obviously contributes something to the nature of the object as known, and therefore, according to Mr. Joad, may have manufactured the whole of it. Mr. Joad, however, shrinks from the conclusion, and therefore denies the (to me) manifestly true supposition on which the conclusion follows. His only arguments are directed against the conclusion, and depend upon the further presupposition that reality must be something wholly external to, and other than, mind. It seems to me perfectly clear that his attempts to prove this are made possible only by the presupposition that it is already proved and, indeed, that anything else is unthinkable. I would suggest to him that there is at least the possibility of another way ouLt, a way which certainly deserves a little further explora- tion. So far from his problem being the refutation of idealism, it is precisely this problem which leads to the development of idealism in its modern forms. I would add just one word on the subject of sense-data. I am aware that on this subject he is perhaps more likely to find support than I, but I should like to press upon him the question whether these sense-data are given direct to the mind as the basis and starting-point of further knowledge, or whether they are given as the result of analysis by mind itself. If they are the first, I should say that such things could not possibly be given and never are given; if they are the second, they are fictions which may have a greater or a less utility in psychological investigations. I</page><page sequence="22">234 H. J. PATON. am concerned with them only in the first sense, and I deny that in that sense they can be an object of mind apart from the activity of the mind which knows them. Certainly, the brown patches which are the object of my present seeing are what they are as instances of a universal, as having a definite position in space and time, as organic parts of an ordered world. They are, in short, much more than sense-data and cannot be given to sense at all. Except as distinguished from other things they are to me nothing, and this distinction is possible only to a mind whose activity goes beyond the moment. I believe that Plato in the Theaetetus disposed of these unrealities, and that although the same error is constantly recurring, his arguments-not to mention those of Kant-have never been answered. We must all have observed the great difference that there is in the quality of a sound which we thought to be caused by something far away, and then discover to be caused by something near. And I am glad to have an opportunity of expressing my disagreement with the view so often stated that " if I look at a penny a yard away and a halfpenny an inch away, the brown patch which I see and which I call the halfpenny will be larger than the brown patch which I see and which I call the penny." Such a statement is true, only if I regard both as existing in the same plane parallel to the plane of the eyes. When we estimate the relative sizes of things we do so only by reference to some situation in space. This, however, is merely a side-issue, and my heresy no doubt may require qualifications. What I must insist upon is that the mind always and necessarily contributes something to the character of the object as known. Mr. Joad may be right in saying that this implies at least the possibility that the world as known may be created-or, if he prefers it, manufactured-by mind. His difficulty about this is simply an unargued prejudice that reality cannot be mind-created, and consequently that in knowing the mind-created we are knowing something other than</page><page sequence="23">ERROR. 235 the real. The plausibility of such a contention depends on my view upon a false theory of mind. I do not know how far Mr. Joad would accept my account of his theory of mind, but it appears to me that he regards the knowing or thinking mind merely as an object or series of objects. He thinks of mind as an object which is contemplated, rather than as an activity which is enjoyed. Mind is to him something about which he thinks, and not the thinking about thought which he himself practises and enjoys. I believe, from something I read of his elsewhere, that he modifies this position, at least in regard to art, but I can see no sign of any other position here, and his remaining doctrines all seem to me to follow from some such view of the mind. At any rate, starting from a supposition of this kind, I can go with him a certain distance along what I believe to be the path of error. The mind, as an object, becomes at once inert and inactive. It contributes nothing to what it knows. Its relation to its object is always the same. That relation is one of direct aware- ness, and the mind is, I presume, a series or succession of direct awarenesses. Objects of various kinds, all existing in complete independence-sense-data, objects of thought, true and false propositions, objects of dreams and hallucinations-impinge upon it or comne before it at different times. In all this it does nothing whatever. The difference between sensing and thinking, the difference between denying and asserting-and even, I suppose, the difference between questioning and supposing and thinking and knowing-all these lie on the side of the object. The mind, in short, becomes a mere blank, all its differences are transferred to its objects, and all that remains to it is direct awareness or, perhaps, a series of direct awarenesses which in themselves are all exactly alike. This direct awareness is perhaps not improperly described as a relation, or, as Mr. Joad calls it, " a relationship." I do not know whether he meant to imply</page><page sequence="24">236 H. J. PATON. some difference between " a relation " and " a relationship, but in any case I should like to know what it is that is related. Such a view appears to me a perfectly coherent development of the initial supposition. I would merely ask why we should stop at this point. I can see no reason for retaining the mind on this view at all. It would be much simpler to regard minds as mere bundles of objects. The next step would be to deny all connexion between the different objects. I do not know whether Mr. Joad takes this step or not-he denies the " unified penny," although he speaks of it as " a system of distinct but similar sense-data "-but, in any case, it appears to me the logical conclusion. To regard mind as merely an object like other objects is, in the end, to deny mind altogether and to abolish unity from the world. Without the activity of mind the world becomes a series of distinct existences between which there is no connexion. Mr. David Hume and Mr. Bertrand Russell have already shown us the way, and I can see no ground for stopping short of their conclusions. (III.) I now turn to questions more nearly concerned with truth and error. One of Mr. Joad's strongest objections to the doctrine of Mr. Cator is that it abolishes the criterion of truth. Yet, so far as I can see, Mr. Joad's own theory has precisely the same effect. If our state of mind is exactly the same, whether we attain truth or falsehood, it surely follows that we can never know whether our judgments are true or false. In each case we have direct awareness, and in each case we have a real object. The fact that at other times we have direct awareness of another real object does not seem to me to help, but I shall return to this later. For myself, I can only say that if the mind is reduced</page><page sequence="25">ERROR. 237 to a series of immediate or direct apprehensions, there is no distinction whatsoever between truth and error. Mr. Joad is very anxious to maintain that we know certain humble truths to be true, such as that 2 + 2 = 4, and that Csesar crossed the Rubicon. This view has obvious attractions, but I do not think that Mr. Joad's theory justifies such knowledge, nor do I think that those who hold other theories " overlook" such facts-so far as they are facts. My confidence in such truths depends not on immediate awareness, but on the fact that these judgments are bounid up with a whole system of judgments, and that the whole system stands or falls with them. Roman history is all nonsense if C2esar did not cross the Rubicon, and arithmetic is all nonsense if 2 + 2 are not equal to 4. Yet I must add that we must be prepared to modify even some of the truths which seem to us most certain and most immediately apprehended. If I understand it aright, the work of Einstein compels us to modify theories which formerly seemed to be most certainly true, but this does not mean that these previous theories were errors and nothing else. The kernel of Mr. Joad's position appears, however, to lie in the contention " that what I think is true cannot possibly have any bearing upon what is true." Such a contention seems to me sound so far as it asserts that thought, considered as an immediate fact or a direct momentary awareness, does not guarantee the truth of what is thought. An idealism which rests on pure immediacy (like that of Bishop Berkeley at his weakest) is erroneous, and can with difficulty be distinguished from some forms of realism. It does not, however, follow that thinking plays no part in truth or error at all. On the contrary, it is thinking which makes either truth or error possible. Without thinking there is no truth, and without thinking there is no error. No statement of any kind i, an error unless somebody believes it to be true. It is one thing to say that truth (or what is true) x</page><page sequence="26">238 H. J. PATON. does not depend only on an immediate awareness. It is quite another thing to say that mind is not essential to the existence of truth or to any thing's being true. Mr. Joad seems to me to confuse these very different statements or to infer the one from the other. He might as well argue that because a rifle without a cartridge is harmless, it therefore plays no part whatever when a man is shot and killed. Up to this point I seemn to myself to have been able to follow, although not to accept, Mr. Joad's argument. Thereafter, perhaps because of the brevity of his exposition, I find myself in a strange region wherein I can maintain no sure foothold, although I can still recognize that some of the things he says are said also by other people. There is consequently a danger of my criticisms seeming merely verbal, but I can only say that they are meant as an attempt to clear up what are to me obscurities. I gather first of all that the mind is directly aware of judg- ments or propositions (the terms seem to be interchangeable) which are objects among other objects. Yet they have the curious property of being " about " other objects, and these other objects (which I understand to be always the special kind of objects called objects of thought) are always equally, and appar- ently in the same sense, real. These other objects (called also " the content " of the propositions) are known to the mind, and their being known and being real are entirely independent, alike of anything that the mind does, and of the truth or falsity of the proposition which is about them. I take it that the proposition or judgment is not merely a collection of words or sounds, and it is said to " assert." I am not sure whether a proposition or judgment may be also called a belief; Mr. Joad speaks of "true beliefs " and at the same time describes truth as a property of judgments or propositions; on the other hand, he talks of " belief in " a judgment-is this different from " direct awareness " ?- and says it has no bearing upon the question of truth or falsehood.</page><page sequence="27">ERROR. 239 He also speaks of " the proposition in which belief is asserted." Does this mean that the proposition asserts belief (which would make belief essential to a proposition), or that something else asserts belief in the proposition ? And, again, a proposition is said to be " asserted " as well as to " assert." These statements are all taken from Mr. Joad's final exposition of his theory of truth and error with which alone I am now concerned. The subject is a difficult one, but the account given certainly does not help me to understand what is meant by a judgment or proposition which is not an activity but an object of mind. For myself I can understand a person or mind judging or assert- ing, and when I say that a judgment asserts I mean simply that a mind in a particular act of thinking asserts. What is asserted is " that S is P." " That S is P " is what is asserted not what asserts, and I am quite prepared to call it a proposition. But in itself it is nothing except a collection of words; it is a mere abstraction, and calls ouLt for the " I think" to complete it and to give it life. Apart from the " I think," which is not an object thought about but a subject thinking, there is no truth or error at all. Hence I do not understand in what sense Mr. Joad's proposi- tions assert, since to me nothing can assert except a mind. Nor can I understand what it is that they assert. Mr. Joad compli- cates this by introducing what he calls " facts." Propositions assert facts, and these facts, like the propositions themselves, are " about objects of thought." Perhaps we may dismiss these facts as mere reduplications of the propositions. Propositions, then, are about objects of thought and assert that these objects stand or do not stand in certain relations to one another. At this point we come to the most interesting and surprising part of Mr. Joad's theory. Thought is for ever doomed to remain within the circle of its own peculiar objects (whatever they may be) and can never penetrate to sense-data or physical reality-</page><page sequence="28">240 H. J. PATON. these latter are to Mr. Joad the same. I think I am right in saying this about thought, and I am certainly right in saying so about propositions. We cannot think about sense-data or physical realities, and we cannot make or know propositions about them, for such propositions do not exist. Fortunately, however, some objects of thought have physical counterparts c illed sense-data, though how Mr. Joad can think or assert this on his own theory I am quite at a loss to understand. This alone seems to me sufficient to condemn his theory, and the innumerable difficulties of detail need not concern us. The judgment that Cosar crossed the Rubicon " asserts a specific con- nection between the conceptual objects Caesar and the Rubicon." These objects are not to be called " ideas " ; if they were so called, it would be obvious that the judgment never asserts that our idea of Coe3ar crossed our idea of the Rubicon. Mr. Joad wisely prefers to call them " conceptual objects," and I at least have not the remotest conception of what these are, if they are not old-fashioned ideas, nor have I the slightest conception as to what is meant by the " specific connection " between them. I can only think-though I am precluded from doing this on Mr. Joad's theory-that it is something like the connexion between sense-data moving about in space. Propositions are apparently true or false according as the conceptual objects which they are about have or have not physical counterparts. At this stage Mr. Joad reintroduces one of his " facts." " That which makes a belief "'-I think he must mean a proposition here-" that which makes a belief true is a fact not about the object of thought, but about its physical counterpart." This shows that I was wrong in identify- ing " fact " and " proposition " above, because no proposition, however much it may seem to be so, can really be about physical counterparts. If this " fact " is not a proposition, I do not know what it is. But such details do not greatlv matter. Truth</page><page sequence="29">ERROR. 241 and error depend on the same relation existing between con- ceptual objects on the one hand and their physical counterparts on the other. This helps us not at all unless there is a thought which can somehow apprehend both the conceptual objects and the physical counterparts; but this, according to Mr. Joad, is impossible. Incidentally, I should like to know whether the r Aationship between sense-data is itself apprehended by thought or not. Even if it were apprehended by thought, this would not be sufficient for our purpose3, since before we can make use of it, we must be able to think that it is the relationship between the sense-data. A complete separation between perception and thought, between sense-data and conceptual objects, cannot explain truth and error, unless that separation is somehow overcome. I must, therefore, reject Mr. Joad's tlheories and seek the light elsewhere. Even if I endeavoured to swallow all the assertions which Mr. Joad makes, I could not believe that a proposition asserting a relationship between conceptual objects was true or false according as that relationship did or did not exist between physical counterparts. It would be false only if the proposition (or the thinker) asserted that the relationship between the conceptual objects implied a similar relation between the physical counterparts; and this it neither does nor apparently cmn assert. If I assert a connexion between conceptual objects, and that connexion exists between these objects, then manifestly I judge truly, whatever connexion exists or fails to exist between other objects. Unless I think something about these other objects, it is surely nonsense to sav that I am in error or have made an erroneous judgment about the objects which alone are the objects of my thought. There can be no error in a proposition or in anything else unless somebody believes it to be true; andc the error must be relative to what it is about, and cannot be a relative to what it is not about. However useful it may be to y</page><page sequence="30">242 H. J. PATON. divide up the living work of thought into propositions, we ought not to let ourselves forget that all-important truth. Thinking is as necessary to error as it is to truth, and I venture to suggest it is the attempt to deny this, which is ultimately responsible for all Mr. Joad's difficulties. I feel that it is a little unfair to criticize without offering my own views for criticism, and for that I apologize. But circum- stances over which I had no control have compelled me to write this in a hurry, and my paper is already too long. I had hoped to finish by expounding my own view briefly, but I fear I must leave it to be gathered from my criticisms and from the indication of it which I gave at the beginning.</page></plain_text>
