<plain_text><page sequence="1">Forty-Plus Writing Activities Theodore W. Hipple, Robert G. Wright, Jane H. Yarbrough, Bruce Bartholomew As English educators, we support writing in the schools, as much of it as possible. Yet we lament the apparent fact that a large proportion of writing is some variation of the five paragraph theme or another dreary book report. We believe that most of the objectives of the writing program can be achieved with other kinds of writing, with the frequent use of short, manageable writing activ- ities. Forty such activities follow; many permit a number of variations. 1. Cereal Box Copy. Someone, believe it or not, actually writes the stuff that goes on cereal boxes. Why not your students? Let them invent a new cereal. Or give them Soggies, which don't snap, crackle or pop, but simply go to the bottom of the bowl and sulk. Then have your cardboard caricaturists write what would go on the box. 2. Invention. Bring in a common object, a brick or a spatula, an umbrella or a paper clip. Give the students five minutes to list as many uses as possible of this object, another five minutes to share what they have written. 3. Contest Entries. Remember the old, and occa- sionally still used, contest format: "Tell why you like in 25 words or less." Try it in your classes. Let each student choose a product or agree on one collectively. In many ways this activity is a paradigm example of what we are proposing. It is short, easily handled in part of a class period. Students can manage to com- plete it without all the problems attendant in the writing of long themes or book reviews, where they make false starts, use faulty organi- zation and logic, commit numerous grammar and usage errors. It can be shared quickly with others in the class, creating a sense of excite- ment that derives from a common writing experience. It requires only minimal grading, at most a check in the gradebook to signify that the activity has been completed. It will give students confidence; they can indeed write, if not long assignments, at least short ones. And this confidence can help make good writers out of previously mediocre ones. 4. Writing Characterizations. With the students' help, compile a list of 100 words or more that describe people. Then choose a well-known public figure or a character from a literary work the students are familiar with. Thinking of that character, students are to put a "yes," a "no," or a question mark beside each word as it applies to that character. Once they are done, ask them to use the "yes-words" and write a brief characterization. 5. Test Items. As you teach a long work of litera- ture on which you plan to give an objective test, ask each student to write six test ques- tions, two easy, two hard, and two sort of middling. Your students will have a writing assignment: you'll have a collection of ques- tions, many of which you can use. 6. Soap Opera Teasers. "Will Mary find happi- ness with Reginald? Can Rachel survive psy- choanalysis without having an affair with her doctor? Is Mike really the father of Stephanie's child? Or is it Alec? Will the opening of the March 1983 73</page><page sequence="2">gay bar next to Herb's bowling alley force Lucky out of the closet? Be sure to tune in to tomorrow's episode of .... ." Your students can do as well, probably better. 7. Self Analysis About Writing. Help your stu- dents to think through how they write by urging them to write a paragraph description of their writing "space." Do they write at home or at school? At a desk or table or on the floor? With the TV going or a baby sister crying in the next room? Do they use pen or pencil? Blank or lined paper? (Refrain from boring them about Abe Lincoln in front of the fireplace writing on the back of a shovel.) 8. Obituaries. Ask students to write the obituary for a literary character. Variation: students write their own obituaries for sixty years hence, thus making them reflect on what they want to be and do. 9. Dear Abby Letters. First, everyone in the class writes Dear Abby letters. Though anonymous, these are coded so that the writers can get their own letters back. A second writing activity- someone else in the class writes a response. Variation: write and answer the Dear Abby letter a literary character might have written. 10. Guinness Book of Records. Have students individually or in small groups make up eight or ten absurd records that might appear in the Guinness Book of Records. Examples: soph- omore girl rides crocodile for eleven minutes. Freshman boy eats 4.7 school lunches in one sitting. Ask students to choose one of the records and write the sports page report for it, replete with all sports page jargon. 11. Coining Words. Read "Jabberwocky" to your class and ask them to write four to eight sentences that contain at least ten made-up words which appear to make sense. Sharing these can be fun and can teach students some- thing about how language operates. 12. Those Bad Days. Read aloud Judith Viorst's Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, a children's book that even sophisticated seniors enjoy. Then urge students to describe their own terrible, hor- rible, no good, very bad days. Variation: next time ask them to describe their marvelous, beautiful, really fine, very good days. 13. Musical Images. Play a classical record, Deb- ussy's La Mer, perhaps, or Pachelbel's Canon. Before playing it, tell your students to let their minds flow freely while the record is on and to write images or sequences suggested by the music. You may want to play the record twice. 14. Point of View. Ask students to become typical schoolhouse objects-a locker, an English teacher's red Bic pen, a grammar handbook, a basketball-and write a page or so describing a day in the life of their object. 15. Dialogues. Your students or you outline the scenario. The blind date between Charlie and Bev is a disaster. The first time he used it, Tom smashed Dad's new MG. Ginny is told by the drama teacher that not only did she not get the lead in the school play but that it went to Rachel, who, Ginny thinks, couldn't act her way through a door. The students write the dialogue, with at least ten exchanges in speak- ers. 16. Cartoon Captions. You supply the cartoons or comic strips from which you have removed the captions. Your students create new captions, some of which will be funnier than the origi- nals. 17. Traveling Stories. Each student has the same opening: "It was a dark and stormy night," or "The trouble really began when ... " Given that instruction, each student writes for two minutes, then passes the paper on to the next student who adds new material for two min- utes, then passes, etc. After ten or so minutes (five writers) have a few of the stories read 74 English Journal</page><page sequence="3">aloud. Caution: allow a little extra time for the later writers to read what they receive before they add to it. Variation: do this activity in groups of five: that way, all students can get their portions read to at least their small group. 18. Horoscope Entries. Read some from the news- paper, then ask students to write their own. Addition: let them invent and describe a new sign, with all the paraphernalia about that sign, e.g., the characteristics of people born under it, the way in which these folks mesh with those born under other signs. 19. Design a Person. Each student chooses a name from the telephone book, then writes a char- acter "profile": age, sex, physical appearance, family status, job, favorite things, basic atti- tudes, beliefs about gun control, or snow- mobiles. You could add to this activity some study of Auden's "Unknown Citizen." 20. Names. Develop with your class a list of things that need names: a baby girl, a new tree, a motel that changed owners, a new hamburger stand, another kind of Chevrolet or Ford, a just discovered planet. Get about twenty-five or thirty, then set students to work writing the names. 21. Question Writing. Your students are going to get to interview someone famous. But first each one has to write at least ten questions to ask the interviewee. 22. Paraphrasing. Ask students to pick a para- graph (you may wish to stipulate minimum length) from a high school textbook in an- other subject and rewrite the paragraph so that it could be understood by a third grader. 23. Make Up Book Titles. Students first make up several book titles. Then, in two or three sen- tences, they summarize or describe each book. 24. Rewritten Cliches. From a list of twenty or so clichbs, students choose six to eight to rewrite, using both synonyms and literal meanings. 25. Ads, Classified. You've got thirty words, kids, to sell your old tennis racquet or to promote yourself as a prom date. Write the ad. 26. Ads, Billboard. Give each student a blank sheet of paper which becomes their billboard. They design the billboard. 27. Ads, Radio. Your students choose (or invent) a product and write the 125-200 words that will be used in a radio advertisement. Let them tape it if they like, complete with background music of their own choosing. These ads, like many of the writing activities, share a useful feature; they have real world equivalents. Stu- dents see or hear ads and know or can learn that someone, somewhere, somehow, writes them. Writing which has this realistic con- nection is valuable to explore in English class so that students can understand that writing is not simply a classroom exercise but something they may do when they are no longer in school. 28. Mental Maps. Put a term on the board- college student or wolf or marriage or suc- cess-and then ask students to write eight or ten features they associate with that term. Their subsequent sharing of what they have written will probably reveal that no two peo- ple have exactly the same mental picture for even what all believed to be commonly under- stood terms. 29. TV Synopses. Your students are to write synopses of several TV shows. They can use no more than two sentences with no more than thirty words total. Can they hook (or con) viewers into watching? 30. Life in These Reader's Digests. Flood the classroom with Reader's Digest anecdotes, jokes, quotations, etc. Urge your students to try to write something similar. A few may even be worth submitting. 31. Dictionary Entries. You make up a word: squix or dorf or cundle. Your students supply the dictionary entry. Their sharing of what they have created can be fun and can help them learn something about language. 32. Short Story Introductions. For many students, writing short stories is exceedingly difficult; they can begin them, but they can't end them. Presto. Simply have them write the begin- nings, the opening two or three paragraphs or just the opening couple of sentences. (Some students, by the way, given this kind of man- ageable assignment, will go on to finish the stories they have begun.) 33. Wedding Report. Lady Macbeth married Mac- beth. Holden and ol' Sally Hayes, five years later, finally tie the knot. Hester divorces Chil- March 1983 75</page><page sequence="4">lingworth, marries Dimmesdale, with Pearl as the flower girl. Your students' task: write the wedding story for the local newspaper, prop- erly reflecting, of course, the participants, the time, the place, the guests, the reception, and any other details they think fitting. 34. The New Commandments. Let your students write-in Biblical language if that won't vio- late your sense of church-state separation- their versions of the Ten Commandments for behavior at school, at home, at McDonald's, at a football game, at a party. 35. Beastly Thoughts. Ask students to choose some animal they can watch for a bit, the family dog or cat, a neighborhood squirrel, the cow on the next farm, or the roach in the next room, and spend some time in its head to imagine the world it inhabits. Then, with no anthropomorphism, they are to write a de- scription of the animal's world and life. 36. Wishes Unlimited. Grant your students one wish. They write it down, then write their justification. (Credit is deducted from those who immediately wish for three more wishes.) 37. Limited Space. Send your students to the library with instructions to summarize an ar- ticle or an encyclopedia entry. You provide the paper: one 3 X 5 notecard. They'll learn some- thing about selective reading and writing. 38. Letters. Urge your students to write letters-to friends, parents, teachers, principals, editors, penpals-and send them. 39. Lists. The Wallace family has made a career of lists. So can your students. Over time, say a month, they are each to list their ten favorite books, movies, songs, foods, flavors of ice cream, whatever. These lists, by the way, if put on the bulletin board, will tell your students a lot about each other. And how about putting your own lists up there, too? Your students might be interested in knowing how much you like Casablanca and chocolate almond fudge. 40. Writing Activities. Have students write a writ- ing activity, something like these. You won't be able to use every one you get, but you'll find some of them valuable. And even the rejects may spark an idea in you. So there, for what they are worth, are our Forty- Plus Writing Activities. Use them in good health, yours and your students'. The authors teach at the University of Florida.</page></plain_text>
