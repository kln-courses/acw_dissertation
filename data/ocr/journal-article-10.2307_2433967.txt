Berlin, Heidelberg and New York: Springer-Verlag. 1978. Price DM 125. The publication in 1970 of Hallea and Oldeman's slim Essai sur l'architecture et la dynamique de croissance des arbres tropicaux can now be seen as something of a milestone in tropical botany, an attempt to bring order to the diversity of tree form and to build on the findings of early workers like Raciborski and, more lately, Corner, among others. Since then has appeared Horn's Adaptive Geometry of trees (1971), Oldeman's L'architecture de la fore't guyanaise (1974) and there have been important contributions from Cremers on lianes and, from workers of the Montpellier school, theses on herbs and conifers as well as dicotyledonous trees. Our under- standing of the reproductive biology and 'strategies' of rain forest trees has also greatly advanced with several symposia dedicated to these topics, most recently at Harvard Forest, the proceed- ings of which were published as Tropical Trees as Living Systems (1978). The authors admit to presenting 'a point of view' in this book, which is a synthesis of all the recent work and reviews on tree structure, 'strategy' and forest dynamics in the tropics. An introductory chapter attempts to show the botanical wealth of the tropics when compared with the temperate zone: the large angiosperm families with predominantly tropical dis- tribution, the tropical woody families or subfamilies with temperate herbaceous counterparts and the numbers of species of trees represented in rain forests compared with temperate forests. The second chapter deals with the elements of tree architecture from the morphology of seed- lings through the positioning of buds to shoot growth both rhythmic and continuous, phyllotaxis, branching, branch polymorphism, inflorescences and root systems. Chapter 3 is essentially a revision of the Essai, though most of the beautifully illustrated examples, the elegant line drawings among them being chiefly the work of Halle himself, are new. Further, there is a key to the architectural types or 'models', whose naming after botanists is ably defended. Of the theoretical models of the Essai, one is suppressed and a second is recognized as Stone's Model, exemplified by the 'coniferoid' pandans of Madagascar; bamboos and similar plants are included in a second new model, named after McClure, making a total of 24, including one theoretical model. Models, as developing morphological types, are seen in this work as con- venient and frequently observed noda in a continuum and are extended to cover many lianes and herbs. Several lianes do not fit these noda as the work of Cremers has shown: they are all to be found here, and include our own ivy. Under each model is a list of taxonomic examples and also a fashionable 'strategy of the model', explaining the possible ecological importance of each branching type: the plea, by P. F. Stevens, communicated by T. C. Whitmore at the Harvard Symposium, to replace this word, so charged with notions of planning and tactics, by the less anthropomorphic 'syndrome', seems to have been ignored, so that we find considerable discussion of the zoological 'k' and'r' strategies. The next chapter, 'Opportunistic tree architecture' covers the possibilities of plastic response as a result of damage and the develop- ment of the crowns of forest trees, dwelling particularly on Oldeman's concept of 'reiteration' - the repeating, during development of the basic model - and its relation in terms of energetics with the environment, as well as vigour and death. Chapter 5 deals with the architecture of forest plots and the dynamics of successional cycles in forests. There is a glossary, a very full bibliography with useful references to the pages where the works listed are cited in the text, and index of plant names with their models, and a subject-index. The book is printed on high-quality paper in a two column format. The price may seem steep, but by modem standards such a copiously illustrated well-bound book of over 440 pages must be considered as something of a bargain. With such a scope it is not surprising to find several errors in Latin names, so that, for example, Quercus petraea appears as Q. sessiliflora and Guarea guidonia as G. guara, but, like the rather random use of authorities for these names, these scarcely detract from the (American) text, which is almost free of printer's errors. There are one or two surprising unsupported statements, however, as (p. 2): 'The tree-ferns and most woody monocotyledons (e.g. palms) represent examples of trees based on primary, not secondary, construction and it is likely that these monocotyledons are a relatively recent experiment in tree-making', particularly when it is suggested (p. 220) that the peculiar branch- system of the coniferoid pandans of Madagascar is relictual. A more serious criticism, perhaps, is the rather dry, clinical way in which the facts are presented, with little zest for what to</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 859 students is truly exciting botany, and even a rather provincial apologeticism, which verges on the embarrassing. Nevertheless, this book is bound to be a spur to research in tropical botany because so many questions are thrown up. What is it about Rauh's Model that makes it so successful in so many economically important timber and crop trees - oaks, pines, mahoganies, Triplochiton, rubber, breadfruit, ash and avocado? Why should that weed Sphenoclea zeylanica (Campanulaceae) have the architecture of either the frangipani and sumach or the oft-quoted coniferoid pandans? Why should some Mammillaria spp. (Cactaceae) be the only dicotyledons to have truly dichotomising apices like the doum palm, and the Bird of Paradise? If the 'lower orders' of clubmosses and other Pteridophyta, and even cycads, represent the relics of the old arborescent order, may not the architecture of the toxic herbs of the Ranales tell us something of the shape of early angiosperms? More importantly, the architectural continuum, with the 'central' position of models like Scarronne's show how within families, the model grades can be climbed, so that within genera like Cassia, Boea, Euphorbia, and Pandanus as well as Carlina, we see the results of architectural radiation within genera, though this is scarcely hinted at in the text. The 'unbranched' Corner's Model may be attained from suppression of flowering in the plagiotropic branches of Rubiaceae as Leroy has pointed out: clearly only careful taxonomic and developmental studies can show us the clades in the grades. Our colleagues in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been working on the architecture of temperate examples of Compositae and Campanulaceae for several years. Who with possibly more easy access to the tropics will take up the challenge of Phyllanthus, Vernonia, Eugenia, Piper or Solanum? Again, what does this range of evolving architecture, from the flagelliflorous pachycaul to the wispy rheophyte, mean to the bats, the birds, the ants, the bees and the squirrels, employed by and employing the trees? For obvious practical and historical reasons, a good deal of ecology and physiology as well as morphology derives from the study of temperate plants. Yet it was the tropics that led Adanson to condemn the Linnaean System of classification and where von Humboldt and Robert Brown pioneered what has become plant geography, and it was in the tropics that Eugen Warming carried out the first 'ecological survey': indeed, it was the tropics where Darwin and Wallace came to their convergent conclusions. Yet until recently the tropics still bore the stamp of the colonial imposition of botanical (as well as agricultural) cant with its roots in the essential morphology of Goethe and the deterministic ecology of Clements, its final flowering being the 'museum hypothesis' of rain-forest origins. Not before time then, the winds of change are bringing a reversal of attidude such that the preface to this splendid book exclaims, 'If the reader still retains a sense of the monstrous, the fabulous or the unreal in using this book he should try to make a mental reversal of the situation, which is botanically more appropriate. How strange is the temperate tree leafless for a large part of the year, with such marked synchrony in its development, its brief period of extension growth, its ability to flower only once a year and with its peculiar anuual radial increments of growth in the wood. Here is a bizarre object indeed!' D. J. MABBERLEY</page></plain_text>
