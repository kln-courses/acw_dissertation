<plain_text><page sequence="1">The authors reply How and why do humans value species? This is not just a question of esoteric interest, but is also important for applied reasons. For example, the management of invasive species is affected by the choices people make in selecting organisms, and the deci sion to prioritize certain species for conservation can also be affected by personal likes and dislikes. In a recent article (Front Ecol Environ 2007; 5[8]: 409-14), we showed that the amount of scientific research conducted on a species is related to the interest the public has in that species. In response to our article, Proenca et al. conclude that scientific output could be used to identify which factors affect exis tence value (ie the satisfaction that humans derive from simply knowing that a species exists). They propose that organismal complexity (as quantified by the number of cell types in an organism) is related to existence value, and base this argu ment, in part, on the fact that scien tific output per species is higher for more complex organisms. This con cept is certainly appealing and is sup ported by their analysis. The ques tion, however, is whether complexity per se drives people's interest. Despite the fact that most life is microscopic, humans tend to con centrate on macroscopic organisms. This is natural, as we can directly perceive and interact with these organisms, using our unaided senses. However, the apparent interest of humans in more complex species may be due, in part, to an anthro pocentric view of complexity. A dif ferent measure, say the number of life stages, would result in a very dif ferent relationship between scien tific output and complexity. Instead, we propose that existence values are more affected by how closely a species resembles our own. To test this hypothesis, we regressed the number of scientific articles per species (as presented by Proen~a et al. above) against the age since diver gence between each group and the human lineage. Age since divergence was used as a measure of similarity to the human species, although mea sures of morphological similarity could also be used. We found a similar relationship to that demonstrated by Proen~a et al. (Figure 1). We would caution, as we did in our original article, that it is very easy to generate plausible hypotheses using data on scientific output or public interest. Scientific output is mea sured here using journals that define themselves as publishing papers on ecology or conservation biology. Taxonomic biases in the delineation of fields of study need not reflect general value systems. Existence value (as with scientific output or web presence) can be affected by trivial or frivolous factors. For exam ple, when, in 1997, visitors to the London Zoo were shown pictures of the red-faced black spider-monkey and the Diana monkey, they said they would prefer to conserve the red-faced black spider-monkey; but if ?

Type II (reduced major axis) regression between number of papers per species and the time since each group became separated from our own lineage. Pearson r = 0.75, n = 14, P &lt; 0.01; regression equation (95% Cl): intercept = 6.97 (3.48, 10.46), slope = -3.07 (-4.36, -1.79). Variables were log1o transformed. Age since split was derived from recent dated phylogenies (Berney and Pawlowski 2006; Donoghue and Benton 2007). In the case of mammals, we used an average value between the split from chimpanzees (most recent, 8.25 Mya) and the split from monotremes (oldest from a living lineage, 176.8 Mya), values were derived from averaging minimum and maximum estimates in references, and the range in time of divergence for mammals is shown as a dotted line. they were told the common names, their preference was reversed. This effect is partly attributable to the fact that Diana, Princess of Wales, had recently died (Carvell et al. 1998). Scientific output, however, gives a much better indication of utilitarian value and shows less geographic and taxonomic bias than measures of how generally popular species are (eg internet presence). As such, scien tific output is not the best surrogate for existence value (as defined here). We conclude by suggesting that multiple factors are needed to explain the way humans assign value to species - complexity, size, accessi bility, degree of anthropomorphism, edibility, and cultural influences. Each factor is only useful if used in the appropriate context, when it is closely related to what we are trying to measure. We doubt whether taxo nomic patterns in research output, and the peculiar cultural biases that are partly responsible for those pat terns, should be used to set conserva tion goals.
