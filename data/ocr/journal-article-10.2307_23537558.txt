<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Pleasures of Stupidity: Gary Larson as a Baudelairean Caricaturist David Carrier When, in the course of writing my High Art: Charles Baudelaire and the Origins of Modernism, I came to Baudelaire's essays on carica ture, I was pleased to find that Michele Hannoosh's recent book dealt so nicely with this topic that there was no need for me to take it up.1 I felt fortunate that she had developed this account—my own approach, providing a philosophically plausible reconstruction of Baudelaire's ideas, rather than merely setting them in historical context, proved not easy to extend to his remarks about caricature. Developing an admirably detailed discussion of the caricaturists discussed by Baudelaire, Hannoosh provides a veiy full and convincing statement of the historical context of his thinking, but has little to say about the application of his ideas to present day caricature. That is unsurprising, for this part of his aesthetic theory is grounded in highly traditional Catholic ideals. Much (but not all of) Le Peintre de la vie moderne can be read as a manifesto for modernist art, a prophecy of the tradition of art depicting urban consumer society running from Manet and the Impressionists through to Andy Warhol, the other Pop artists and their successors in the 1990s.2 In comparison, De l'essence du rire, like Baudelaire's account of Delacroix, seems centered on ideas now essentially of historical interest. Baudelaire proclaims that our pleasure in laughter shows the importance of original sin. We laugh because we are sinners: "II est cer tain ... que le rire human est intimement lié a l'accident d'une chute ancienne.... Dans le paradis terrestre ... la joie n'était pas dans le rire" (527—8). Christ experienced anger and tears; but "aux yeux de Celui qui sait tout et qui peut tout, le comique n'est pas" (527). It seems obviously difficult to extract his claims from this essentially theologi cal context; but if modern day unbelievers will have great difficulty taking literally such claims, what remains of Baudelaire's theory of caricature? What then has caused me to come to reconsider this way of thinking has been my more recent study of a contemporary caricaturist whose im ages, in absolutely uncanny ways, exemplify this Baudelairean theory of humor. Although in the 1980s Gary Larson became much more famous than any visual artist known only within the artworld, his caricatures 62 Nineteenth-Century French Studies 27, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, Fall-Winter 1998-99</page><page sequence="2">David Carrier 63 have not inspired commentary, so far as I know, by art critics. This is surprising, for his extraordinarily inventive images tell us a great deal about American culture of that era. My aims here are, first, in self— conscious emulation of "Quelques caricaturistes étrangers," to present a Baudelairian account of Larson's concerns; and then to suggest what light this can shed on Baudelaire's account of caricature.3 For purposes of my theorizing, it is convenient to have at hand a condensed summary of Larson's ways of thinking; it would be inappropriate to offer an exhaustively documented discussion of images that are very easily accessible.4 Larson employs repeated, even obsessive development of a few central concerns; for every example I cite, many similar ones could easily be provided. Totally apolitical—apart from his passionate support for animal rights—Larson hates change, which he thinks always brings disaster. Taking almost all his subjects from lower or middle class white American life, but not a chauvinist, his only significant foreign settings are African jungles, the Arctic, and rivers inhabited by headhunters. Borderlines between city and country, and humans and animals, are blurred: deer are hunted in their own living rooms; dogs steal family cars; animals take photos on vacation and appear on quiz shows. Larson loves endless mindless repetition—people in hell doing five million leg lifts or discovering that cold fronts never arrive; and disasters that be fall those stupid enough to eat potato chips or buy tropical fish in the desert. (Heaven is of less interest to Larson than hell.) He shows petty theft, minor crime and, occasionally, homicide; menacing ocean scenes hold a special attraction for him. He adores sharks. Larson's archaeologists are doomed never to learn about the past; his anthropologists, to understand nothing about the 'natives' they study. His animals mimic humans doing stupid things. Larson's world is oddly asexual in a preadolescent male way. He loves toilet humor and hu man—animal couples, not as illustrations of bestiality, but as just an other variety of dumbness. His women would just as soon be married to an animal—and why not when all people are so stupid. Apart from such normal fascinations as dog-cat battles, his odd obsessions include cross-dressing cowboys, men with peg-legs, and—what does this mean?—the erotic significance of chickens. His stupid, sadistic and dysfunctional characters enjoy their lives. Gravely serious academic commentators have written much about 'postmodernism' and the end of history. Larson's immense popularity— is there anyone who really dis likes his work?—shows that, at some level, very many people suspect that progress is finished. It is hard to imagine him showing the tri umph of virtue. The man at the blackboard who has discovered "the purpose of the universe"—an elaborate equation he works on sums up to zero—summa</page><page sequence="3">64 Gary Larson as a Baudelairean Caricaturist rizes Larson's world view. Living in a run down universe can be fun. Scientists who play games instead of doing research; pilots who cannot read instrument panel dials; a musician who tries to perform with only one cymbal: Larson's characters are happily hopelessly incompetent. He really has only this one major theme, disaster— that is why en countering his pictures one-by-one in the newspaper was more fun than looking at the collections of his art. Humor is only occasionally a cen tral concern in old master art.5 Unfunny paintings, calling for knowl edge of esoteric texts, give their interpreters the sense that they are smart. Larson's cartoons make you feel as stupid as the characters he loves to depict; temporarily imagining being stupid, he shows, can be fun. Or as he puts it, quoting Mel brooks: "Tragedy is when I cut my fin ger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die" (PreHistory 5). One part of the essence of such humor, Baudelaire claims, is "de développer chez le spectateur, ou plutôt chez le lecteur, la joie de sa propre supériorité et la joie de la supériorité de l'homme sur la nature" (543). But this is not the whole story, for in his view humor also re quires recognizing our own inferiority; our dual nature means that we have simultaneously a sense of superiority and of inferiority. (No doubt we are thus logically inconsistent—that too shows something about our nature.) Seeing Larson's idiotic characters, we recognize our own superi ority. I would never let my dog drive whilst myself hanging out the car window like a dog. This seems, on reflection, a modest superiority. A farmer meets extra-terrestrials who are walking hands— "Inadvertently, Roy dooms the entire earth to annihilation when, in an attempt to be friendly, he seizes their leader by the head and shakes vigorously": Why is he funny (Far Side 3 78)? Few people really desire that our planet be destroyed and yet, the idea that it might be de stroyed by such stupidity is, who can doubt this?, amusing. We laugh, flattered to be reminded that we are not as stupid as people who read manuals about snake identification whilst fatal snakes bite them, or aliens who come all the way to Earth only to steal chickens. Responding aesthetically, we are enjoying imagining disaster. It may seem odd to speak of 'an aesthetic response' here, for all of Larson's fig ures, even Jackie Onassis, are hopelessly ugly. And yet, lucky people!— that does not disturb them, for they are found desirable by others. When "the elephant man meets a buffalo gal," they find each other ravishing (Far Side 4 109). In his apolitical way, Larson shows the problems with belief in the superiority of your own species. Fascinated by religion, Larson is skeptical of its claims. His charac ters frequently are scientists or inventors, but he rejects entirely belief in technological progress; it is surprising that nerds, one of his great sub jects, seem to love him. Everyone in his pictures looks old, even the</page><page sequence="4">David Carrier 65 children—they have no future. Bad as it presently is, this world could be even worse: That assertion is funny because we postmoderns fear that it might be true. Perhaps this is why technocrats seem to especially enjoy his work—this worry must be an occupational hazard for them. Larson appeals to those who don't much like modern art. When he shows Leonardo da Vinci learning to draw from a matchbook adver tisement, you cannot but help feel his populist ambivalence about high culture. Need you be a closet-sadist to laugh at Larson's fat women calling her dog to run into a blocked door, "Here, Fifi! C'mon! .. . Faster, Fifi '."(Far Side 2 9)7 When Amnesty International objected to his scenes of torture—"Congratulations Bob Torturer of the Month" reads the slogan behind three bound victims—he said: "this group has at least raised my consciousness to this problem" (PreHistory 164). Like cat lovers who objected to showing the dog tying up the new cat, these critics blur the line between appearance and reality. As no doubt we all do in responding to caricatures—but without some such temporary sus pension of disbelief, cartoon art would be impossible. Could a man in a slowly sinking rubber life raft be watching a portable TV? Might a time machine run out of gas, leaving its inventor stranded amongst di nosaurs? Would deer tie up a hunter, leaving the hunting license stuck in his mouth? If you think too much about them, Larson's images cannot 'come off. To understand his art, you must both enjoy momentarily be ing stupid and feel, at the same time, somewhat uneasy. Comedy, this is the old cliché, is an inherently conservative artistic genre—it shows that nothing changes. What more specifically defines Larson's caricature is its roots in joke-telling. You cannot 'tell' a Matisse, for his art is essentially visual; but you can usually 'tell' a Larson, for mostly his essential conceptions are verbal. What Baudelaire calls our "double nature" (543) consists in the capacity, on one hand, to enjoy imagining people being injured in disasters whilst ourselves remaining safe and, on the other, to feel ourselves implicated in the disaster. Laughter is the outward manifestation of this dual ity—it expresses our awareness of being both inferior and superior, both at the same time. God and advanced intelligences from other planets are no smarter than humans in Larson's anthropomorphic world—his sun rises and sets, run by a man who operates a switch. Aliens intelligent enough to operate flying saucers are as dumb as humans— they crash because a bee enters their spacecraft or because they get too close to the Statue of Liberty. Even God is humanly stupid: He dials the wrong phone number; discovers that snakes are easy to construct; and when a child— who are His parents?— tries to make a chicken in his room.</page><page sequence="5">66 Gary Larson as a Baudelairean Caricaturist Almost all Larsons are absurdly easy to interpret. (When it takes ef fort to understand his image, as in some few he analyzes, then he fails.) Interpreting museum art, inevitably commentary treats it as an example of personal expression, the artist's choice of subjects understood in rela tion to his patrons, his politics, and his private life. When Larson shows scenes that almost everyone understands immediately, asking about his personal life is irrelevant. Many accounts of populist culture, growing out of Marxist tradition, propose to see through such images; today this condescending procedure is no longer satisfying. No doubt Larson makes these images because of events that his biographer might discuss in detail. But insofar as what we value in a Larson is what that work tells us about our collective desires, fantasies and fears, such analysis is essentially irrelevant. What constitutes the interpretation of a Larson is laughter; in thus interpreting a Larson cartoon, we learn about ourselves and our culture, and recognize that there are some things that we don't know about ourselves. Such knowledge, we may think, shows our superiority; that ignorance demonstrates that we are, at the same time&gt; inferior. Larson almost always has a very simple iconography. Two men in a disheveled room peel open the Venetian blind—"Roommates Elvis and Salman Rushdie sneak a quick look at the outside world" (Far Side 5 23). To understand Larson's images you need only know of the most fa mous people: Einstein (the would be basketball player), Picasso, Superman and the once notorious hijacker D. B. Cooper. 'Only a one-lin er'—what visual artist wants to be told that once you have 'gotten it' there is nothing more to be said about his or her works? But Larson's en tire œuvre consists of but the pleasure of imagining disaster, which is why it is perhaps good that he retired early on—he is a one-theme artist.6 For a long time, Baudelaire's unoriginal theory of humor seemed to me obviously implausible.7 Finding Baudelaire's odd anti-theology obviously absurd, to me it seemed a waste of time to analyze his argu mentation. Some modern caricaturists develop images playing with Baudelairian pleasure in doing evil.8 Edward Gorey's scenes of chil dren's disasters, for example, belong to this somewhat precious self-con sciously camp tradition. But unlike Gorey, Larson is a genuinely popular artist. Baudelaire's irony, Hannoosh argues, implies that his account of humor should be interpreted not as 'false', but rather metaphorically, as an ironizing which itself is "an example of comic art in the best sense" (283). We must pretend to take the doctrine seriously, whilst knowing that it is play—and this is unlike simply rejecting Baudelaire's theology, on one hand, or taking it to be true, on the other. This kind of play is very naturally associated with Larson's carica tures, which are funny only for the viewer who can pretend to accept</page><page sequence="6">David Carrier 67 something like his view of sin. If you find Christian morality absurd (or offensive), then you can hardly make sense of joking scenes set in hell; if you literally believe in hell, then the idea that this hot place might temporarily be cooled by a boiler failure, as Larson often sug gests, will not be funny.

All rights reserved</page><page sequence="7">68 Gary Larson as a Baudelairean Caricaturist Only some of Larson's scenes play with theology in this way, but this attitude can be suggestively generalized to explain how he thinks of his non-religious subjects. Very frequently he shows animals behav ing like, or being mistaken for humans; these situations, denying the traditional claim that human being are inherently different from ani mals, thus touch upon religious tradition. To imagine that a cat could kill a bird by blowing up its cage; that a dog would play ventriloquist to a cat sitting on his knee; or that the rowers on a slave ship be enter tained by pianist playing "row, row, row your boat": this requires tak ing something like a former believer's attitude towards religion. What is comic for Larson are situations that can be called absurd because they are neither simply the way things are nor just impossible to imagine. To speak in terms of Baudelaire's doctrine of our double nature, we laugh because "l'artiste n'est artiste qu'à la condition d'être double ... "—be cause "il est bien vrai qu'il le sait; mais il sait aussi que l'essence de ce comique est de paraître s'ignorer lui-même ..." (543). Larson's examples employing ideas of religion provide such a useful model not because caricature need depict explicitly sacred subjects, but because frequently modern attitudes towards theological tradition em body this essentially comic attitude; how funny it would be, such a secu lar person can naturally think, were such traditional beliefs correct. In High Art I argue that Baudelaire's general aesthetic includes two very different accounts: a traditionally oriented way of thinking, and an an ticipation of a radically original art of the city—a compromise ex pressed in his passionate admiration for both Delacroix and Guys. What makes his theorizing hard to grasp, I claim, is that it presents these very different approaches, without any attempt at synthesis. The same, I now see after studying Larson, could be said about his the ory of caricature, which both looks backward historically to religious tradition and, by treating that way of thinking ironically, expresses the skepticism associated with secularization. When we laugh at his images, we both take seriously religious ideas and act as would—be modernist skeptics; to describe this situation in Hannoosh's ironical terms, the very doubleness of our divided nature appears with carica ture in viewing one such image. Why do we laugh at Larson's caricatures? Here, in ways that Baudelaire himself does not spell out, his art criticism provides some suggestions. High Art draws attention to the very general way in which Baudelaire following the tradition in which interpreters under stand a picture by 'moving it', envisaging the next moment of a scene. (The difficulty of modernist visual art, I argue, is that insofar as it fails to indicate what will happen next, it threatens to be indecipher able.) Larson's humor very often depends upon a viewer's expectation about how thus 'to move' images. (He probably learned from comics, in</page><page sequence="8">David Carrier 69 which that next scene is actually depicted.9) Presented with one mo ment of an ongoing action, we imagine disaster in the next scene. As he explains, his images are funniest when, only implying "what is about to happen," they thereby heighten "the tension" (PreHistory 136). Why do we project the next scene thus?—there is, after all, nothing to pre vent us from imagining that disaster be averted. "Don't be alarmed folks ... He's completely harmless unless something startles him" (Far Side 192). Imagining the next scene when the door of a crowded elevator will close on this 'harmless' lion's tail is funny. A model of the way we 'move' such pictures is provided by the great Larson in which hapless man walks unknowingly to face a sniper (Fig. 1): "Misunderstanding his employees' screams of 'Simmons has lost his marbles,' Mr. Wagner bursts from his office for the last time" (Far Side 4 142). Imagining the next moment when Wagner will be killed, we laugh. That we seemingly freely choose this as the next scene reveals our double nature. We enjoy cruelly imagining disaster—for there is nothing to prevent us from supposing, in happier narratives, that the sniper throws down his weapon or that Wagner, realizing the danger, does not come forward. This disaster we imagine is not, so we hypocriti cally think, really our fault—we only pretend that it seems inevitable. Such pictures are what Arthur C. Danto calls enthymemes, visual syl logisms with an obvious missing premise that the reader must supply. This reader, Danto says, "is not, as a passive auditor, told what to put there; he must find that out and put it there himself ..." (170).10 Reasoning thus, we both acknowledge aggressive fantasy, and disavow any such intention. Both taking ourselves to be superior and acknowl edging our inferiority, we disavow our fantasy, pretending to believe that it is not our malice but only Larson's situation that inevitably will bring about disaster. This reveals our dual nature—laughter for Baudelaire is the 'spasm' that results from this clash. For a some time, many art historians have had much to say about how Baudelaire's account of Guys anticipates the modernism of Manet and the Impressionists. Now, with the aid of Hannoosh's research, it is possible to discover that his aesthetic theorizing also anticipates re cent accounts of popular culture. An interpreter of Gary Larson's carica tures can learn much from De l'essence du rire. What Baudelaire did not very fully anticipate was the ways in which such applications of his theorizing could tell us about shared cultural values. Reflecting on Larson's caricatures reveals much of our present day beliefs about ag gression, progress, and the role of religious ideas.11 Carnegie Mellon University Department of Philosophy Schenley Park Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-3890</page><page sequence="9">70 Gary Larson as a Baudelairean Caricaturist I thank Paul Barolsky, Arthur C. Danto, Marianne L. Novy for comments on earlier drafts, and Michele Hannoosh, who has provided extremely helpful detailed suggestions. Notes ^See Michele Hannoosh, Baudelaire and Caricature: From the Comic to an Art of Modernity and my "Baudelaire's Philosophical Theory of Beauty," published in revised form in my High Art: Charles Baudelaire and the Origins of Modernism. 2a different approach is provided by Froidevaux, Baudelaire: représentation et modernité, ch. 5 "la caricature ou l'affirmation négative du beau." ^My subject is Larson the cartoonist as revealed in his work, not the person 'Gary Larson' who may, for all I know, be a quite different sort of individual. ^Larson's caricatures, presented without original date of publication, are published in The Far Side Gallery, The Far Side Gallery 2, The Far Side Gallery 3. The Far Side Gallery 4, and The Far Side Gallery 5. These themes are found throughout Larson's work; only when dis cussing individual caricatures do I cite references. 5But see Paul Barolsky, Infinite fest: Wit and Humor in Italian Renaissance Art. 6His work has some affinities to Thurber's, but otherwise it is hard to cite art historical sources for Larson's art. He has, in obviously ironical ways, described his childhood sources of his art—see Larson, The Curse of Madame "C". ^Larson's one exercise in Baudelairean Satanism, the scene of Christ, risen from the grave, wondering "what time it is ... I feel like I've been dead for three days" (PreHistory 105), is, as he notes, not very funny. 8 See my High Art, 'Introduction: Baudelaire's Metaphysics." 9See my "Piero délia Francesca, Hergé, and George Herriman: Comics and the Art of Moving Pictures." l^My argument borrows from Danto, The Transfiguration of the Commonplace, which applies rhetoric to visual images.
