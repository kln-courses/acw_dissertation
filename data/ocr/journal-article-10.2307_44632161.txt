Khalil and Kuang-Huei Lin Engineering Mechanics Dept. General Motors Research Labs. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT Current mathematical simulation of occupant impact and interactions with the vehicle interior, in the event of crash, is based on lumped mass-spring formulations. These models lack the fidelity to simulate structural deformations and to capture the detailed contact and interactions between the occu- pant and the impact targets. As a first step in improving the technology, we have developed a detailed three-dimensional finite element (FE) model which simulated thoracic impact on the steering wheel. The model consisted of Hybrid III thorax, lumbar spine and self-aligning steering wheel. The model was developed using DYNA3D and represented the dynamic large deformation response of the system by a combina- tion of solid, beam and shell elements. Both elastic and viscoelastic material properties of various system components were experimentally identified and implemented in the model. Initially, the accuracy of the individual component was ascertained by comparisons with corresponding experimental data. The predicted midsagittal force-deformation response of the thorax from an impactor with initial velocities: 4.3 and 6.7 m/s, respectively followed closely corresponding corridors derived from dummy and human cadaver tests. Also, the elastic-plastic response of the self- aligning structure in the steering wheel was accurately captured, and compared favorably with test results. Then, the thoracic impact on the steering wheel was computed for three initial velocities: 6.9, 7.9 and 8.8 m/s. The predicted system kinematics and thoracic and wheel deformation and associated force histories compared well with corresponding mini-sled tests. In addition, the model provided a unique capability for predicting the evolution of the contact force between the thorax and the steering wheel. INTRODUCTION Occupant protection in vehicle crashes is an important design consideration during the vehicle development process. The majority of occupant harm results from occupant movement and subsequent collision and interaction with the pas- senger compartment interior components. In frontal crashes, the steering assembly is likely to be im- pacted by the driver more than any other components [l]. This observation has motivated much research to mitigate potential horacic harm. The research focused on two issues: i) to understand the biomechanics of thoracic response and tolerance to impact; and ii) to develop the necessary hardware and associated experimental techniques to assess the extent of thoracic protection provided by the steering assembly structure. The biomechanics lit- erature of thoracic response to impact loads is voluminous [2-8], and discussing it here is beyond the scope of this paper. Accordingly, we shall briefly review current technology used to evaluate the efficacy of steering assembly design in occupant protection should a crash occur. Mini-sled experiments [9,10], in which the head-neck-thorax complex of a Hybrid III anthropomorphic test device or dummy is propelled to impact the steering assembly are typical test methods. Similar tests are also used where the Hybrid III dummy is replaced by a rubber model of the human torso commonly known as " blak tuffy" to comply with Federal Motors Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 203. In addition, "Hyge" sled tests are used where a complete Hybrid III dummy or a human cadaver is used to impact the steering assembly [11]. Finally, an instrumented vehicle with a Hybrid III dummy in the driver seat is allowed to impact a rigid barrier from some initial velocity (approximately 50 km/h) to comply with FMVSS No. 208. All these tests provide invaluable information to assess steering assembly design for occupant safety. However, such experiments are both time consuming and expensive, particularly at the early stage in vehicle design. Therefore, accurate analytical models to complement or replace the tests are desirable≈° 1864</page><page sequence="2">Interestingly, while there are several experimental techniques developed to evaluate steering assembly design, there is a comparable dearth of knowledge pertaining to detailed analyti- cal models of either the Hybrid III thorax or the steering structure. The currently available model of the thorax [12], developed in the early 1970's, consists of three lumped masses interconnected by nonlinear springs and viscous dampers. This model can simulate the unidirectional force-deformation re- sponse of a dummy or a cadaver thorax. The inertia, spring and damper constants were established by iteration to insure that the model response falls within established experimental data. In 1987 a similar model was developed to simulate the impact response of the steering assembly by the second author. This model relied on component experimental data to characterize struc- tural deformation and energy absorption. The basic deficiency in these mass-spring models lies in their inability to capture the contact and interac- tion process that takes place between the thorax and steering wheel. Although rigid body mechanics based occupant simulators such as CAL3D [13] and MADYMO [14] can account for the interaction between contacting segments, it can only be formulated in one dimension along the impact di- rection. Extension of the contact algorithm to three-dimensional treatment is not feasible due to load path dependency. Furthermore, calculation of interaction force between the thorax and a potential contact target requires a mutual force-deformation curve for each impact situation. Thus hardware design, at the vehicle concept stage, is often based on past experience and engineering judgment due to the lack of quantita- tive techniques based on mechanics of deformable structures. A rational design procedure for impact protection based on a system model of the occu- pant and vehicle might lead to improvements in steering structures from a thoracic protection point of view. This paper describes the development of a finite element system model consisting of Hybrid III thorax, lumbar-spine and self-aligning steering wheel. The model was developed using DYNA3D and represented the dynamic large deformation re- sponse of the system by a combination of solid, beam and shell elements. All material properties of the various system components were represented as measured experimentally. Initially, the accuracies of the component responses were ascertained by comparisons with corresponding ex- perimental data. Then, the thoracic impact on the steering wheel was computed for three initial velocities: 6.9, 7.9 and 8.8 m/s. The predicted sys- tem kinematics and thoracic and wheel deformations and associated force histories compared well with corresponding mini-sled tests. ANALYSIS Mathematical modeling of contact-impact and interactions between two or more deformable bodies such as the thorax and steering wheel can be approximated by FE analysis. Such techniques represent our best mechanics based knowledge of treating contact problems based on their detailed geometry and fundamental material properties. Classical closed form techniques, though desirable, are almost impossible to use without extreme simplification in the geometry and associated material response. The problem at hand is characterized by the following attributes: complex three-dimensional geometry consisting of solids, beams and shells; large deformations and rotations; several linear and nonlinear materials (elastic, elastic-plastic and viscoelastic); transient dynamic response persisting for about 50 ms; and time varying boundary conditions at the contact interfaces. Our previous experiences in vehicle structural crashworthiness analysis [15] has shown that the explicit FE method can be used in this type of analysis. We used the nonlinear FE code DYNA3D to develop the system model. A comprehensive description of the code capabilities and its founda- tion can be found in Refs. 16 and 17. DYNA3D utilizes updated Lagrangian mechanics to formulate the semi-discrete equations of motion for solid, beam and shell elements. The equations of motion are derived by applying the principle of virtual work to a weak form of the momentum equation. The spatially discretized second order differential equations in time are subsequently solved by the central difference (explicit) technique. This integration scheme requires no formulation of a global stiffness matrix, and thus reduces computer storage and associated cost. The code is highly vectorized for computational efficiency. The compu- tation cost is further reduced by using primitive (one-point integration) elements and "hourglass" control to eliminate the spurious energy modes. The code has several constitutive models to allow for simulating various linear and nonlinear material responses. The most unique feature of the code lies in its versatility to capture the dynamic con- tact between three-dimensional interacting deformable structures. SUBSYSTEM FINITE ELEMENT MODELS AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION The development and validation of the Hybrid III thorax and self-aligning steering wheel models are described in this section. HYBRID III THORAX MODEL - The Hybrid III dummy, developed at GM in 1976 [18], represents state-of-the-art anthropomorphic test devices currently used in the automotive industry for compliance with FMVSS 208. Its head, neck and chest responses correspond to biomechanical frontal impact data of human cadavers. The thorax FE model was developed to mimic the geometry of the Hybrid III components as closely as possible (Fig. 1). The model components included the spine, shoulders, spine plate, six ribs with bonded damping material, sternum, sternum pad and outer skin. The sternum pad simulated the urethane foam bib provided for load distribu- tion between the outer skin and sternum. The rib 1865</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 Hybrid III thorax hardware and corres- ponding FE model cage was attached to the back of the spine and to the sternum which in turn was attached to the sternum pad. The shoulders, approximating the in- ertia of the clavicles, rested on top of the spine. The outer skin, simulating the outer jacket of the dummy, was attached to the spine in the back and to the sternum pad in the front. For each model component, the type of element, number of elements and type of material are listed in Table 1 below: Table 1.

For the shoulders, ribs, spine, spine plate and sternum the material properties were assumed to be isotropic, elastic with their constants selected from the literature. The viscous damping coeficient for the discrete rib dampers was taken from Ref. 12. The rib cage was initially modeled with shell elements bonded to a layer of viscoelastic solid elements to simulate the material. Prelimiary executions of the model exhibited monotonically increasing deformation in time leading to rib cage inversion. A thorough investigation revealed that the single-point-integration shell element formulations in DYNA3D [19,20,21] were incapable of capturing the long duration impact response of the rib cage. Thus, to obtain an accurate thoracic response without having to develop a new shell element, the rib cage was subsequently modeled with three-dimensional elastic beam elements in combination with discrete viscous dampers. The beam element was derived from Hughes and Liu three-dimensional nonlinear shell formulation [20,22]. This modification resolved the problem of rib cage inversion encountered previously. The latest ver- sion of DYNA3D has a fully integrated shell ele- ment which we have recently tested and shown that it can reproduce the results obtained from beam elements. For the purpose of validating the thorax FE model, existing experimental data was selected from the literature. In such experiments, the Hybrid III dummy was seated upright on a horizontal plat- form and struck at the front by a cylindrical bal- listic pendulum impactor over a specific area of the rib cage. The thoracic force-deformation response compares well with the similarly established human cadaver impact response corridor [18].

The 1866</page><page sequence="4">predicted rib deformation-time response compared well with the experimental data (Fig. 3). Figure 4 presents the predicted force-deformation response superimposed on experimental data from the Hybrid III thorax and human cadaver. It is clear that the thorax FE model accurately captured the essential features of the corresponding hardware responses and demonstrated the viscoelastic effects in the model. Fig. 4 Force-deformation response from the tho- rax FE model in comparison with experi- mental data STEERING WHEEL MODEL - The self- aligning energy absorbing steering wheel used in this study was an experimental prototype developed at GM [23]. A deformable energy absorbing (EA) structure consisting of six prefolded plates was built into the steering wheel hub. Upon driver im- pact on the lower rim, large deformation of the EA structure would allow the wheel to tilt downward and align with the driver's thorax, resulting in a broad contact between the chest and the wheel rim, spokes and hub. Deformation of the EA structure in the wheel hub would also provide ad- ditional energy absorbing capacity. This steering wheel was tested quasistatically as shown in Fig. 5. The loading rod was pin- connected to the uniaxial load cell on the station- ary crosshead of the test machine so that no bend- ing moment would be transmitted to the load cell. To minimize lateral forces on the load cell, the Fig. 5 Static test of self-aligning energy-absorbing steering wheel specimen was positioned in such a way that the loading point on the wheel rim would stay as close as possible to the loading axis. The wheel rim was loaded at its 6-o'clock point in the vehicle forward direction. The resulting load-deflection curve is shown in Fig. 6. 4 000 - : 3000 * a h --DYNA3D Analysis g 2000 -pV r*] -==~ Static Test 0 L- 01 23 45 678 Deflection (cm) Fig. 6 Comparison of FE dynamic force-deflection curve with experimental static force- deflection curve for self-aligning steering wheel The FE model of the steering wheel represented the geometry by a combination of solid, beam and shell elements. Table 2 lists the type of element, number of elements and type of material for each of the five parts of the wheel structure. The wheel assembly was rigidly supported by constraining all three degrees of freedom at a number of selected nodes on the hub core. Elastic-plastic material properties, selected from the literature, were assigned to the wheel components. Table 2.

A lumped mass was assigned to the node at the 6-o'clock position of the rim to dynamically load the wheel. Two nodes on each side in the immediate vicinity were tied to this central node to form a finite loading area, corresponding to the test setup. An initial velocity of 10 m/s in the vehicle forward direction was assigned to these five nodes to simulate an impact loading. A sequence of deformed shapes of the self-aligning wheel is shown in Fig. 7. The deformation occurred mostly in the EA hub area as was observed in the quasistatic test (Fig. 5). The model captured the key features of the structural behavior of the wheel under impact loading, without penetration. The computed dynamic load- deflect ion response is shown in Fig. 6, superimposed on the quasistatic 1867</page><page sequence="5">time = 0 2 ms 4 ms 6 ms 8 ms 10 ms Fig. 7 Time sequence of deformed shapes of self- aligning steering wheel from FE model test result. As expected, the dynamic response curve exhibited inertial spikes during the first 2 cm of deflection, where the predicted force level was higher than the quasistatic force. The subsequent dynamic force response oscillated about the static force level. This comparison indicated that the FE model deformation and associated force were in good agreement with the experimental results when the difference between the dynamic simulation and quasistatic test was taken into consideration. THORACIC IMPACT ON STEERING WHEEL BY MINI-SLED EXPERIMENT Three thorax-steering wheel impact tests were conducted for the purpose of validating the finite element system model. The test setup and test results are described in this section. MINI-SLED TEST SETUP - As shown in Fig. 8, the Hybrid III thorax was accelerated with a linear propulsion device up to a prespecified ve- locity and then released to impact the self-aligning steering wheel mounted on a special load cell which can monitor three force components and two torque components. Two string pots were installed to monitor the displacements in the column longitudi- nal direction at the 6- and 12-o'clock locations of the wheel rim.

The trolley was constrained by the guidance system to move horizontally in the vehi- cle fore-aft direction. Upon the thorax contact with the wheel rim, the trolley would keep moving, but the thorax would start rotating about the lateral pivotal axis and pushing the lower wheel rim forward. The thorax and the trolley were instrumented to record chest deflection at the mid- sternum, chest triaxial acceleration at mid-spine and trolley acceleration in the fore-aft direction. In each test the total impact energy was expected to exceed the energy absorbing capacity of the steering wheel assembly. To prevent damage to the thorax, it was necessary to install an addi- tional energy absorber to dissipate the excess im- pact energy. For this purpose, a Hexcel honeycomb block which would provide a constant force level of 4000 N while being compressed was mounted on the sled base and aligned with the trolley as shown in Fig. 8. Between the honeycomb block and the trolley there was an initial gap. Three high speed cameras (1000 frames per second) were used to record the impact event. MINI-SLED TEST RESULTS - Three impact tests were conducted at 6.9, 7.9 and 8.8 m/s. Figure 9 shows the sequence of kinematics for the 6.9-m/s test from 0 to 50 ms at 5 ms intervals. Initially, the lower part of the thorax contacted the lower rim and most deformation took place in the relatively soft lower thorax while the steering wheel stayed undeformed. As soon as the lowest rib came in contact with the wheel, the wheel started to tilt and align itself with the chest. As time progressed, the chest contacted not only a large portion of the wheel rim but also the spokes and the hub plate and further crushed the energy absorbing hub. Upon rebound the thorax separated from the steering wheel. The deformed shape of the wheel looked very similar to that resulted from the static test shown in Fig. 5. In each test the wheel rim displacements measured at both 6- and 12-o'clock points (Fig. 10) reached the maximum at the same time. The maximum displacement increased with increasing impact velocity. In all three tests the measured 1868</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 9 Time sequence of motion of Hybrid III thorax and self-aligning steering wheel in a 6.9 m/s mini-sled test 40 -J--/- *'jA - ^ - -J- 12 o'clock I ^ 30 ‚Äû -4^- I 8 V^' i -¬ª - - : S T' ' -40 '- * ' 'V-V -¬´0 -V-^' 6 o'clock- .¬´o t'^'r * ' - 'K¬ª 0 S 10 15 2025 30 35 40 45 60 56 ¬´0 Time (ms) Fig. 10 Steering wheel rim displacement-time histories from mini-sled tests displacements at the lower rim were consistently greater than those at the upper rim which can be explained as follows. The longitudinal displacement consisted of two components, one due to rotation and the other due to forward translation of the wheel. Refering to the driver side view, the clockwise rotational component was positive (rearward) for the upper rim and negative (forward) for the lower rim. The translational component was negative for both upper rim and lower rim. Therefore, the lower rim displacement had to be greater than the upper rim displacement. The special load cell recorded three components of the column load history in each test. The lateral component oscillated about zero with a very small amplitude since the thorax was supposed to impact the wheel symmetrically. The vertical component acted upward (negative sign) throughout the impact event with varying magni- tude (peak value 3-4 kN). The longitudinal component was the most dominant component with the largest magnitude (peak value 7-10 kN) and its load-time curve looked very much like the resultant curve (Fig. 11). The peak resultant column load increased from 7 to 11 kN as the impact velocity increased. The load cell also recorded two components of the column torque-time history. The chest deflection-time histories for the three tests are shown in Fig. 12. The maximum deflection increased from 38 mm for the 6.9-m/s test to 48 mm for the 8.8-m/s test. 1869</page><page sequence="7">"I 1 I I I I I I I 1 i 10 - zz i ? t' '" ' ¬´ : S f v /-√§aS=; r- : i - ==^¬øM-v^^:=f= f v r- ¬£&lt; ZZc≈π^^- 7/ 1- -'√≠xXi ' ' , 7/ ' ' H ~//S~ ¬∞0 s 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 SS ¬´0 Time (ms) Fig. 11 Resultant column load-time histories from mini-sled tests jm i jaj i i 1 i ‚Ä¢- - 1 - ~ "* ~y*~ &gt;L ~ A / ?/ wz ^'&gt;r' 2 M 'SX I ‚Ä¢ 4R - ; ¬´ s 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 ¬´o Time (ms) Fig. 12 Hybrid III chest deflection-time histories from mini-sled tests SYSTEM FINITE ELEMENT MODEL AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION SYSTEM MODEL - The system model was developed to simulate the mini-sled experiment described in the previous section (Fig. 8). The thorax model had to be modified to include a lumbar-spine mounted between the spine plate and the trolley. A deformable three-dimensional rubber model was developed to replicate the experimentally Fig. 13 System FE model initial configuration corres- ponding to the mini-sled test observed lumbar-spine moment-rotation response presented in Ref. 26. In addition, the shoulder structures were extended downward to simulate the inertia of the upper arms and to limit the upward movement of the top ribƒì The system FE model (Fig. 13) shows the initial configuration corresponding to the mini-sled test. In order for the thorax to rotate about the lumbar H-point, all nodes along the pivotal axis were constrained to slide only in the fore-aft direction on the horizontal plane to simulate the trolley motion. The mass of the trolley was distributed among these nodes. The steering wheel was rigidly mounted to allow no translation or rotation at its base. The wheel rim normal inclined 20 degrees from the horizontal to approximate the steering column angle. A trapezoidal force-time function was used to simulate the honeycomb energy absorber. The shape of this function was dictated by the trolley deceleration pulse observed in the mini-sled test. A peak force of 4000 N was chosen to represent the honeycomb crush characteristics. This force was distributed equally among the nodes along the pivotal axis. Contact surfaces were assigned between the skin outer surface and the steering wheel as well as between the skin inner and the interior components of the thorax. The thorax was then driven at a specified initial velocity to impact the stationary steering wheel. SYSTEM RESPONSE - Three computer runs were obtained corresponding to the three mini-sled tests discussed earlier. In these runs, the thorax was assigned initial horizontal velocities of 6.9, 7.9 and 8.8 m/s, respectively, to impact the stationary steering wheel. The FE analysis provides information about the system kinematics and associated force, stress and strain time histories at virtually any point in the model. The following is a discussion of some responses of the system which is focused on comparing the model prediction with corresponding experimental data. For each impact velocity the interactions between the thorax and steering wheel were simulated for a time span of 0 to 50 ms. Figure 14 shows the overall system kinematics obtained from the 6.9-m/s run, at 5-ms intervals. It may be noted that at 5 ms the forward movement of the thorax exerted small forces on the steering wheel associated with large indentation in the skin at the contact zone due to a stiffness mismatch between the polyurethane skin and the steel wheel. As time progressed, the forward thorax motion en- gaged more of the rib-backed skin with the steering wheel rim, causing the wheel to tilt and align itself with the thorax profile. During this interaction, the EA legs in the wheel hub were subject to large plastic deformation. The forward motion of the thorax continued until 30-35 ms, while the wheel attained its maximum deformation and the thorax started to rebound. As the thorax moved backward, it tended to slide on the tilted wheel and leaned forward slightly more than the experi- mental results shown in Fig. 9. Since friction was not included in the model at the lumbar spine 1870</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 14 System FE model deformations in time V ‚Ä¢ Experiment Model HNllL i - J' i ' i / ' / &lt; ‚Ä¢100 &lt;' ST 7 Ir" _JI__ ZZZZZZZZ-^UZZUƒ™IZZZZZ -150 - - - - - - - - - I- - - - - - - - - - - 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Time (ms) Fig. 15 Predicted trolley displacement-time history in comparison with mini-sled test data junction with the trolley, this might have contributed to this discrepancy. For all practical purposes, it may be stated that the overall kinematcs predicted by the system model was in good agreement with the mini-sled test results. This observation can be substantiated by comparing the model displacement history of the trolley with corresponding experimental data as shown in Fig. 15. It was further observed that the overall sys- tem kinematics did not seem to be strongly affect- ed by the impact velocity. However, the thorax compression increased with increasing impact velocity, which was consistent with the experimental observation. The wheel deformation sequence clear- ly illustrated that the FE analysis had indeed captured the self-aligning action attributable to the EA hub structure. Upon impact, the rim, spokes and hub plate rotated in the vertical plane as a rigid body and energy was absorbed mainly by plastic deformation in the hub structure. The rib cage deformation history computed from the difference between the transverse displacement of nodes A and B, located at the mid-spine and mid-sternum, respectively (Fig. 13), is presented in Fig. 16 for the 6.9-m/s impact run. The compression was less than 10 mm in the time period from initial contact to 22 ms.

The first pulse corresponded to alignment of the steering wheel rim with the thorax surface. In the second pulse, reflecting a full contact of the thorax with the wheel, the compression attained its peak value. The computed compression was in excellent agree- ment with the test data. The thorax compression for impact velocities 7.9 and 8.8 m/s exhibited the same pattern as in the 6.9-m/s run, except for producing proportionally increasing compression as also observed in the tests. The bar graph in Fig. 17 illustrates excellent agreement between the predicted and measured peak thoracic compression. It also shows the dependency of the compression on the initial impact velocity. i ^ ^ ^ RUN NUMBER Fig. 17 Summary of predicted and measured peak rib cage deformations The unique feature in this system model lies in its ability to predict the evolution of the three- dimensional contact force between the thorax and the steering wheel structure. This field quantity has not been computed previously by any model and measuring it experimentally would be extremely difficult. Figure 18 shows the global X, Y and Z components of the contact force history for the 6.9-m/s run. The X and Z forces lie in the mid- sagittal plane and the Y component is perpendicular to this plane. The contact force is an important biomechanical quantity in thoracic im- pact studies as it represents a measure of the me- chanical energy directly transmitted to the thorax. This contact force could be used in formulating chest injury criteria based on actual impact severity input rather than using response quantities derived from the mechanical input such as acceleration or compression [25].

The 12-o'clock point moves backward (positive) and the 6-o'clock point moves forward (negative) as shown in Fig. 19 for the 6.9-m/s run. Good qualitative agreement was noted between the model and the experimental results, indicating that the steering wheel model exhibited structural response similar to that of the hardware. At the 12-o'clock position, the predicted peak deformation was in excellent agreement with its experimental counterpart, with the difference being within 2%. At the 6-o'clock position, however, the predicted peak deformation was about 33% larger than the experimental result. It is likely that this large discrepancy was due to experimental errors in measuring compression by string pots. 80- jƒºƒºj^ƒº ‚ñ° Off. ‚Ä¢ O-OjOCK ‚ñ† ra oc*, ii o-aocx -180-1 1 , , . 1 2 S RUN NUMBER Fig. 20 Summary of predicted and measured steering wheel deformation peak values A bar graph is presented in Fig. 20 to compare the predicted and experimental peak wheel deformations for the three impact velocities. 12-1 ii- a.

The predicted viscoelastic force-deformation response of the rib cage from a ballistic pendulum impactor was in excellent agreement with Hybrid III dummy data and human cadaver experiments as well. 2. The computed elastic-plastic deformation response of the steering wheel showed good qualita- tive agreement with corresponding data from a quasistatic experiment. 3. The FE system model response agreed quite well with mini-sled tests and clearly demonstrated the self-aligning action of the steering wheel. Furthermore, the model captured the three- dimensional contact and interactions between the thorax surface and the steering wheel rim without any penetration.
