Price Â£2 2 s. net.) The author of Territory in Bird Life has enhanced his reputation with this volume. Mr. Eliot Howard combines the power of accurate, sustained, and detailed observation with the faculty of seeing the wider reference of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 717 what he observes and the result is that his theories are built on the bed- rock of carefully recorded facts. In this work we have Mr. Howard at his best, and the result is an important and stimulating contribution to ornithology. When biologists realised the errors into which anthropomorphism could lead them and tried to avoid describing the behaviour of living creatures as if they were defective human beings a considerable advance was made. But then there came on the field the term " instinct," as efficient a word to conceal his ignorance as man ever invented. The value of Mr. Howard's work lies in this, that it is an effort to understand the behaviour of the bird and to describe it in non-anthropomorphic terms. He regards the bird and its environment as a complex of reactions, and makes a determined attempt to sort out the influences which are extrinsic and intrinsic and to show how reciprocal they are. Using as data a remarkable series of detailed observations of Bantings and other species, the writer divides the birds' behaviour during the breeding season into four phases. In the first phase " the female does not appear as a situational item, the male is occupied with his territory." The second phase is marked off by the arrival of the female in a condition to stimulate and be stimulated. Coition, nest-building, and the laying of eggs mark the third phase, and the fourth concerns incubation and care of young. Instead of speaking of these changes in behaviour as being due to the operation of instincts, sexual, aggressive, parental and so forth, the author holds " there are not a number of separate forces, but one neurally linked pattern of reactions which with appropriate intrinsic excitation comes functionally into being." Mr. Howard shows how delicate is the reaction of the bird to its environment and what an important part the pro-cestrum, or period before the female is ready for conjugation, plays in securing that the young should hatch when there is an adequate food-supply. His point of view is shown in the following excerpt : "In a sense there are not two sexes but one sex, not two organisms but one organism, and the purpose of it all is to hatch out young at a certain time in a certain environment." In his concluding chapter, " An Approach to a Mind Story," the writer considers whether a bird's life may be described in purely behaviouristic terms. Is the life-history nothing but the account of external stimuli acting upon inherited structural constitution ? Mr. Howard's conclusion is that there is a mind-story as well as a life-story. There is not only cognitive reference but prospective reference - implying prospective imagery. A bird is not always the instrument of blind reaction. In birds one finds reference which is distinctively mental, and it appears to be the case " that space impressions are revived in the form of imagery whenever internal excitation, with which they were initially correlated, recurs, and that they contribute to guidance of action." " Revival in the form of imagery is the keystone on which the edifice of territory is reared." In this work the writer has advanced ornithological science a distinct step, and whether his views are accepted or not, he has at any rate made it possible for the serious student of bird life to observe in a profitable, systematic way. Perhaps in a succeeding volume Mr. Howard will apply himself to the problems of bird migration. Such observations as those of the sky- lark with two territories should be of value in this connection. The writer of this review believes that migration may be explained without any of the far-fetched hypotheses which have been put forward, but as the operation on the grand scale of factors which guide the bird in its everyday routine - the impulse to seek congenial environment, recognition of territory, and the like. The illustrations by Mr. G. E. Lodge are a valuable adornment and it is a pleasure to find artist and author collaborating. The volume is produced</page><page sequence="3">7i 8 SCIENCE PROGRESS according to the best traditions of the Cambridge University Press, but it is a pity that the price of such an interesting book should be such as to keep it out of the libraries of many of our young ornithologists.
