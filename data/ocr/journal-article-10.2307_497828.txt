<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BRONZE AGE OF OSTERGOTLAND. A monograph by Arthur Nord'n with about 500 figures and 141 plates. Ph.D. dissertation, Uppsala, 1926. Folio, 178 pages text and about 200 pages of illustrative material. Henric Carls- son's Publishing Co., Link6ping, Sweden. This monumental treatise represents fifteen years of research work in the state of Osterg6tland. Part I contains an historical sketch, setting forth the achieve- ments of previous investigators. Then follows a detailed description of relies belonging to the six periods of the earlier and later Bronze Age. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the rock-carvings under four headings: the groups of Vikbolandet, Norrk6ping, Linkiping, Vettern. In Chapter V the author deals with the Bronze Age topography, settlements, place names, domestic and wild animals, age of the rock-carvings, their motives, technique, composition and style, their purpose and significance, development and connections with the Bronze Age carvings of the Iberian Peninsula, lines of communication between the North and the South, means of communications and the racial question in Osterg6tland during the Bronze Age. To the above are added statistic tables, a complete inventory of the rock-carvings of Ostergotland, a valuable bibliography, relics lately discovered, addenda, corrigenda and postscript. The value of the treatise is greatly enhanced by hundreds of excellent illustrations, impressions (avklappningar), tracings, maps and photographs. Part II consists of photographic plates covering the entire material under dis- cussion. Space being strictly limited, all that can be given here is a superficial abstract of the nature of the rock-carvings and the author's conclusions relative to their origin, significance and connections with similar rock-carvings elsewhere, partic- ularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The most important rock-carvings are found in the region of Braviken, and the greatest number within the limits of the city of Norrk6ping. The carvings wher- ever found are composed of human figures, weapons, animals, domestic and other- wise, ships, plain and ornamented, sometimes drawn by horses or borne aloft by human beings, concentric spirals and wheels, both thought to be symbols of the sun, processions of human figures carrying swords, swords carried by two men, sometimes by one, figures suggesting the soles of human feet placed close together, the symbolic significance is not known, and hollows (skalgropar) the meaning of which is debatable. The rock-carvings are found on ledges mostly along the waterways of the state. The regions where the carvings occur have at all times been favorable to agriculture, even during the Stone Age. The carvings, occurring as they do along roads used at the present time, indicate the site of the earliest settlements of the state. The city of Norrk6ping situated at the eastern endof the great waterway: Braviken- Motala str6m-Glan-Boren-Vettern, was a great Bronze Age center, just as today</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 395 similarly situated parts of a region are bound to become centers of production and distribution. There are parallels in the Mediterranean countries. The origin of Norrk6ping may, therefore, be traced back to 1500 B.c. The ax, Thor and St. Olof cults of the state show cultural developments of a certain international homogeneity. In respect to settlements, dwellings, workshops, etc., nothing specific can be said. But since forms for casting bronze axes and metals have been found, such shops must have existed. No remains of animals from the age in question have been found, but the rock-carvings indicate clearly that the horse, horned cattle, the swine, the goat and the dog formed part of that ancient culture. Under the head of rock-carvings and symbolic signs, the author advances the the- ory that rock-carvers, like the later cutters of runes, were professionals. The works at Himmelstadlund, Ekenberg and Fiskeby he attributes to great masters of the craft. In other carvings he sees the hand of two or more (Herrebro, Leonardsberg). The Gladlunda carver was a specialist in animals. As for the composition of the carvings, there is, generally speaking, no evidence on the part of the artist to place his figures in any distinct order--except in the case of the carvers whom he refers to as great-but decorative effect seems to have been aimed at in many instances. The realistic style prevails in all Osterg6tland carvings, with the possible exception of the horse. The usual characterization of the Swedish rock-carvings as realistic in the northern part and schematized in the south, the author rejects in so far as Ostergotland is concerned and suggests a differ- ent classification. It is locality that determines their character. Rock-carvings in southern Sweden are found in the midst of cultivated areas close to the one-time dwellings. The northern, like the Spanish, Portuguese, North African and Italian carvings, are found in uncultivated parts. The same is true in the island of Crete. In the Ligurian Alps they are found close up to the snow-line. They were placed there in order that they might be more easily observed by the "Powers." For the same reason the paintings of the paleolithic caves were placed deep below the earth's surface. During the Bronze Age in Sweden, there were two classes of people: the hunters and the agriculturists. The former sought their "Powers" in the wilds, the latter in the midst of their acres. The southern carvings are therefore more symbolic (sun and sword cults), the northern more often represent objects pertain- ing to the chase. The interpretation of the carvings is impossible unless we assume that they were of vital importance in the life of the people. On the cultivated soil they bound the life-giving energy of the sun for the benefit of the earth's generative power. In the grave they protected the dead against evil powers and furthered his new existence. Likewise the ship, moved about on wheels, constituted part of a cult closely associated with early domestic life in the North. Less certain it is that the carvings had anything to do with a strictly reli- gious cult. However, the author advances the theory-quite contrary to the views of previous investigators-that there is much in the carvings to suggest anthropo- morphism. The "Powers " worshipped, the author thinks, had already been differ- entiated through the spear, ax and sword cults. His hypothesis is based on the gigantic swords in the carvings, now carried by one man, now by two, and found in processions where one being-a giant-towers above the rest. In this connection the author refers to the "Shield-Power" concept and its origin in Greece, where at the time of Homer it found its expression in Pallas Athena. He does not consider Hellenic influence impossible in the North. Whether the Himmelstadlund spear-man, the two horses and the armless figures above the Ekenberg ship could in any way be connected with the signet ring of Mycenae, he leaves open. At any rate, the Ekenberg carvings impress the author as a hymn to the sword, in which one is inclined to see an intensification to the highest potentiality of the sword, i.e. an anthropomorphization of it. Be that as it may, the fact re-</page><page sequence="3">396 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY mains that the people of the period under consideration worshipped the sun and other natural forces and used various symbols for them. Towards the end of the period, anthropomorphism must be assumed. Proof of this are extant miniature statues, explained as a kind of Terra Mater of Oriental origin. There is nothing in this hypothesis to clash with religious cults and practices at a later time in Scandi- navia. The lighting of bonfires at certain seasons is of heathen origin. In the Bronze Age, as at the time of Tacitus and much later, the chariot was part of the cult. The sword and the ax were worshipped. The former was the attribute of Tyr, and from him Odin inherited it. The sword's r6le in heathen cults is essentially religious. And so the hammer. Even today it survives in the thunder bolt (Torsviggen). It passed through the Stone and Bronze Ages as an ax, in the Iron Age it took the form of a hammer, and in Christian time it assumes the form of the cross. So in Iceland. (And if two Bronze Age axes are laid crosswise upon one another, we have the Swastika.) There is a parallel in the Hindu myth of Indra (the Thor of the North). He had a weapon of stone; later it was made of ayas (Lat. aes = copper or bronze). The Golden Horns of Gallehus and their ornamentation-human beings, swords, suns, stags-reflect the continuation of the ancient cult. Under the heading "Ideographic writing " the author asks whether it is not possi- ble that we are face to face with primitive linear script in some of the rock-carvings. In Crete, an older hieroglyphic alphabet wherein ships also figure as alphabetic characters, was the basis of linear script (A. Evans). At any rate, the bronze cul- ture of Osterg6tland has its westernmost sources in Spain at the mouth of Guadiana, Rio, Tinto and Guadalquivir. The rock-carvings of Osterg6tland constitute the final link in a long chain of developments. Tracing them backward, we arrive at the headspring of culture in the North. Hugo Obermaier's theory of the unbroken tradition of rock-carvings through paleolithic, neolithic, copper and bronze eras, the author accepts despite difficulties of the transition period from stone to bronze. The Iberian rock-carvings are strikingly similar to those of istergotland. In one respect they differ: they contain no ships. But since they are synchronic with those of Sweden, there is no reason why Spanish influence should not have made itself felt in the North. To prove this he argues that metals were imported from Spain. Furthermore, he points to the Spanish ax. He thus assumes commercial contacts. The visitors from the North observed the rock-carvings, became acquainted with religious cults, and all this led to imitation at home. There were two routes between the North and the South: the western (by water?); the eastern across the Continent. The latter has long stood as the accepted one (Montelius). The western line of communication presupposes that the people of the North possessed ships. The best proof that they did we have in the rock- carvings. Here follows a long description of the early ship construction and a refer- ence to Tacitus' statement about the seafaring Scandinavians. Under the caption "Race and culture traditions" is discussed the early dualism in Ostergotland culture, i.e. during the period of dolmen burials (ganggriftstiden). At the inception of the Bronze Age, it seemingly came to a close. Yet, during the Bronze Age, the cist appears almost exclusively in the western part of the territory under consideration. Likewise the most characteristic relics, qualitatively speak- ing, are found in the central and western parts. Over against this we have the strong concentration of the rock-carvings in the eastern section. Whether this cultural antithesis is due to racial difference cannot be determined at present. But it is significant if we recall that even at the present time a strange demographic dualism exists in the state. This leads the author into a discussion of the Goths and their exodus from Sweden (Ostergdtland) as related by Jordanes and corroborated by many investigators.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 397 The grit and temper of the emigrants seen in their imperishable achievements on foreign soil, the author recognizes in the inhabitants of the region and at the time with which we are concerned. They, too, have created traditions-literary and artistic-during the course of centuries, first in their bronze and iron cultures and later in Old Nordic literature. The author closes his monograph by saying that there are few localities in the North which show evidence of a continuous cultural development during 3,500 years as does the state of Ostergotland, where during the Bronze Age the master carvers reached the highest artistic level of contemporary rock-carving.
