THE IMPLICATIONS OF HUMANISM AND OF THE PRAGMATIC CRITERION1 Ontological Pragmatism or Humanism.-From the days of Xeno- phanes we have been reminded by philosophers of the fact that each individual is compelled to view the world and to interpret it from the point of view of his own species. The world known by the lion and the gods that he would worship if he worshipped at all, differ from the world and the gods recognized by humanity. Bacon's de- scription of the "idol of the tribe" is perhaps the most incisive form- ulation of this limitation from which we suffer. As human beings we are condemned to know not the world as it is in itself, but only those aspects of the world which may be glimpsed through the im- perfect media of our human faculties. The other idols-the per- sonal equation, and the undue influences of tradition, and public opinion-may, in large measure, be discounted or even removed. They are but slight handicaps to knowledge, as compared with the ineradicable racial limitation of outlook. Now, at first sight, the theory of humanism appears to be nothing but a very emphatic and extended disquisition on the idol of the tribe; but a further examination of the doctrine reveals a curious note of optimism which is usually quite absent from the treatments of this topic. W\Te seem to detect the humanistic pragmatist in the act of bow- ing down to the idol and rejoicing in its presence instead of endeavoring, however, fruitlessly, to cast it out. The ordinary man of philosophic turn can never watch a dog nosing joyously in a heap of refuse without feelings of regret and shame that his human organs of sense preclude him from perceiving any but the unlovely aspects of that refuse. But the humanist seems positively to delight in the narrowness of human vision, and in the limited and anthropomorphic character of human knowledge. And when we seek the reason for this strangely optimistic attitude we find traces of a far stranger assumption, the assumption, namely, 1 For the three preceding papers of this series, see this JOURNAL, VOl. VI., pp. 460-463, 485-490, and 543-549. 561</page><page sequence="2">562 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that the world reflected in the mirror of human faculties is the world, the real world in which we live. Of course this assumption would not be strange at all in a naive realist, or in one who regarded the human mind as a clear and adequate rather than a distorting and limited mirror of existence. What makes it strange in the case of the humanist is that in one breath he descants in the spirit of Bacon and the ancient sceptics on the power of the human mind to overlay reality with humanistic qualities, and in the next he praises the humanized objects thus created as constituting the real world. But because this doctrine is strange I would not imply that therefore it is self-contradictory, or even false. Perhaps it is possible to regard the world known by us as being in large measure determined by our human cognitive reactions and as being, at the same time, the real world in which we live. Indeed, the relation of humanism to the doctrine of the idol of the tribe is rather strikingly analogous to the relation between the theories of Kant and of Hume. Hume demonstrated to his own satisfaction the subjective origin of that law of cause and effect on which all natural science was based. It seemed clear to him that a subjectively grounded science could not apply with any certainty to an objective world-hence his scepticism. But Kant accepting, with certain differences of detail, Hume's conclusion as to the subjectivity of causality and the other categories, took an optimistic attitude and declared that just because the laws of science were man-made they were for that very reason applicable to nature. The cure for the sceptical ills of subjectivism was more subjectivism. Not only causality, but also the spatial and temporal order, in which nature's facts are presented, is subjective. As the laws of nature and the laws of knowledge have, therefore, a common root in human reason, there must of necessity be perfect harmony between them. Out of the very ashes of Humian scepticism arose the phzenix of Kantian rationalism, with its new foundations for science, morals, and religion. But to return. By humanism I understand the conjoined the- ories: (1) That what world we shall know is determined largely by our specifically human faculties, and that these cognitive faculties and functions are in turn determined by our emotions, desires, and needs. (2) That the world that we come to know in this way is the real world itself, and not in any sense a distorted image of it. Our question is: Are the implications of this most novel doctrine realistic or not? My answer is that they may be either, according as they are interpreted. The more natural, and actually the more frequent, interpretation is, I think, definitely subjectivistic. But I shall en-</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 563 deavor to show that there is a second and less obvious interpretation which is quite compatible with realism. Now, first for the subjective interpretation: Human knowledge, whether consisting of explicitly formulated judgments, or of those more primitive and inchoate judgments called perceptions, sensa- tions, and feelings, is always a reaction of the organism to its environ- ment. Every reaction affects the thing reacted upon, and is in its own nature partly determined by that which reacts. The human being reacts in accordance with its needs and desires, hence the environment of human beings, in so far as it is a subject of the cognitive reaction, has been humanized. Through generation after generation men have reacted cognitively to nature and thus nature, or at least the nature that we know, has been moulded and adapted to human needs. This implies that nature is plastic. As a lump of clay conforms itself to the sculptor so nature conforms herself to our categories, which are nothing but typical forms of reaction. This does not mean that any one is free to think what he likes about nature. Any new thought about nature, any new cognitive reaction, has to overcome the momentum, as it were, of the entire mass of reactions contributed by the race during past time. But, despite this acquired structure, the world is and always will be plastic; to what extent it retains its plasticity, we can learn only by experiment. To the question as to whether the humanist believes that the nature that we know was ever wholly without form and void, and whether all her characters are acquired and none of them innate, I can find no clear answer. It seems to be a methodological maxim of human- ism to try to trace back, so far as that is possible, any seemingly stubborn and innate character of the world to the ancient and deep- lying reactions of the race. Even space and time may be regarded as very primitive human reactions which were so tremendously use- ful to man that they were preserved and handed down as integral parts of his cognitive apparatus, so that now he fails to recognize his own handiwork, and tends to regard them as the eternal and in- trinsic properties of nature herself. This way of interpreting humanism assures to us, moreover, a harmony of the good and the true. For the cognitive reactions by which we confer upon nature her forms and characters are governed by our needs and desires, hence reality must be pretty much what the race has wished it to be. When we find bad parts of reality we must, I suppose, explain their badness as due to the fact that even a plastic nature can not be all things to all men, and our present desires are sometimes out of tune with those of our ancestors who got ahead of us in moulding nature. There are two points in this type of humanism that are obscure to me. Would the humanist treat the specific facts of the world, such</page><page sequence="4">564 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY as air and water, or such as stars and comets, in the same way as he treats its general forms of space, time, and number? Are they, too, to be regarded as human inventions, or may they be attributed to nature in her own right, as exceptions, so to speak, to her generally plastic character? And such things as death, pain, and failure-are they nature's own contributions to our world, or are they perhaps the harvest of some ancestral sowing of wild oats, the outgrowths of primitive needs which have been somehow preserved-presumably on account of their utility? A second point that humanism leaves obscure is its relation to bovinism, caninism, and equinism. Are they precluded or implied? Are the forms of the world in which we live the product only of our race or are they also the product of all races? And if the latter, then how are we to think of the relations between these different forms? Is there one nature which is the resultant of all the racial types of cognitive reactions, or are there as many natures as there are types of life? Does, for example, the dog's cognition of the world have any direct effect upon the cognitive forms with which we clothe the world, or are the different sets of categories neutral and transparent with respect to one another? I have tried to formulate the subjectivistic interpretation of humanism in good faith, and to avoid caricature. The doctrine, as so interpreted, seems to me extremely picturesque and utterly false -I hesitate to call it absurd, only because it reminds one so strongly of Kantianism. The plastic reality of the subjective humanist and the Kantian thing-in-itself exhibit the same complacent submission to the infliction upon their own spaceless and timeless natures of space, time, and other forms of human cognition. How, in either case, it is possible, not to mention useful, to know reality as it is not, is difficult to understand. There is one important point, however, in favor of the Kantian over the humanistic view. Kant postulates a transcendental ego as the legislator for nature, while the humanist attributes creative cognition to the natural ego. As we know nothing about what a transcendental ego could do, it seems innocent enough, though somewhat gratuitous, to assume that it can create a world of time and space. But we do know something about our natural egoes, our concrete empirical selves, and to assume that they have in the course of evolution imposed upon nature the very categories which define that evolution-to assume that at a certain time and in a cer- tain place psychophysical organisms did by means of their cognitive reactions create or invent the time and space in which those reactions occurred-to make such assumptions does seem to lead to a perfect seething stew of contradiction and confusion. But let us turn to the more congenial task of formulating the second or non-subjective interpretation of humanism. We can ar-</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 565 rive at this second interpretation most easily by making two simple substitutions in the doctrine we have been criticizing. For the con- ception of objective nature as formless and plastic substitute the conception of multiform variety. And for the conception of cog- nition as creative or transformative substitute the conception of cog- nition as selective. We shall then get a theory not nearly so novel or picturesque as the other, but one that is sufficiently impressive and quite free from paradox. Let us begin with an illustration. Imagine a number of harps, the strings in each harp being of differ- ent lengths from those of the others. Imagine these harps to be set vibrating in response to a disturbance in the air. Compare the harps to living beings of different species, and the air that sets them to vibrating to the world that calls forth our cognitive responses. Now, if you think of the disturbance that causes the harps to vibrate characteristically as being itself toneless, lacking in vibrations of any specific length, then the illustration will apply to the first inter- pretation of humanism. But if you think of the air as containing all sorts of vibrations, from which each harp selects for sympathetic response the particular set corresponding to its own strings, then the illustration will apply to the second interpretation of human- ism. Let us think of nature, not as poor and formless, with the plasticity of soft clay or of a painter's empty canvas, but rather as a being of infinite variety. Of the multitude of energies which are continuously impinging on sentient organisms, each organism can select for specific cognitive response only those few which its own set of organs are attuned to transmit; and from these our perceptual attention again selects those that are adapted to the needs of the moment; and from these again our reflective attention selects those which seem of most value for our rational, or permanent, interests; and, finally, from these last human society collectively selects from each individual mind the best, and with them constitutes human traditions, customs, and science. Not creation, but selection, is the essential feature in all these stages in the evolution of knowledge. The world that we know is a man-made world only if by man- made we mean man-selected. The selection is, moreover, pro- foundly and continuously modified by our needs, desires, and as- pirations. There are other types of relation between objects than the space relation, and it is conceivable that there was a time when our ancestors had not found it either possible or expedient to cog- nize their world under the form of space. Space might in such a situation have been "invented," if by that we mean no more than " discovered. " There are two further points to which I would call attention before concluding the examination of humanism: First, the</page><page sequence="6">566 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY denial of the plasticity of nature with respect to our cognitive responses does not in the least imply that it is not plastic and alter- able with respect to our voluntary activity. Nature may be as dynamic, as changeable, even as indeterministic, as you please and yet perfectly unaffected by our mere acts of cognition. Soft clay is plastic and changeable enough, but it is not changed by our looking at it, by our mere appreciation of its presence, any more than if it was a piece of adamant or an eternal verity. If we want to change the clay we have got to handle it. And if we want to change our environment we have got to perform work upon it. The human race, like all other races, has made very considerable altera- tions in its physical environment, and these alterations have been guided by knowledge. But knowledge has never been directly effect- ive but only indirectly, as a means by which the work of alteration could be effectively carried on. And the second point which I would make is to anticipate a certain criticism. It may be said that the distinction between the first and second types of humanism is a verbal and barren one, a typical intellectualistic distinction that makes no practical difference. I have chosen to ridicule the notion that cognition confers forms upon a plastic nature, and have praised the notion that cognition selects from the many preexisting aspects of nature those which it needs. The only difference, it may be said, between the two notions is that one formulation happens to excite unpleasant feelings in the present writer and the other pleasant feelings. Thus might run the criticism. The only way I could answer it properly would be to refer the reader again to the two formulations and leave him to judge whether the distinction between them is empty or real. But without going over the whole matter, let me call the attention of my hypothetical critic to the following: What I know of the nature of my ancestors depends upon the information that I receive about them. My conception of them changes and grows as my information changes and grows. Isn't this just plain sense? Now suppose I say that my dead and gone ancestors depend upon the information that I receive about them and that they change and grow as my information changes and grows. Isn't this just plain nonsense? And isn't the distinction between the sensible and the nonsensical statement a real and not merely a verbal distinction? Cognition is pointing. The sensations that nature gives us are the pointers or the indicators through which we know nature. The kind of pointers we get from nature will determine which of the qualities of nature we shall perceive. And these pointers, or sensations, will in their turn be selectively determined by the kind of sense-organs and brain which we have. The impressions that nature gives to the horse will point to or</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 567 reveal to him the equinistic characters of the world. The impres- sions that man receives will indicate or reveal the humanistic aspects of the world. The responses of the equine and the human nervous apparatus will respectively constitute the ratio cognoscendi of the world perceived by the horse and the world perceived by the man. To interpret this as meaning that the horse or the man is a creator of the forms and qualities which he perceives in nature is to con- found ratio cognoscen,di with ratio essendi. And just as when criticizing the psychological pragmatist we saw that he would in all probability never have been tempted to identify the truth relation with the experience by which it is verified if he had kept clear the distinction between the cause, of knowing a thing to exist and the cause of the thing's existence, so here we may say that the subjective humanist, or the humanist who should pooh-pooh the distinction be- tween the two interpretations of his doctrine, would be guilty of the stock fallacy of the idealists, whose main basis for identifying esse and percipi is their identification of ratio essendi and ratio cog- noscendi. It sounds very fine and impressive to inveigh (in the ab- stract) against the "abstractness" and futility of distinguishing conation from cognition and the cognitive response from the object cognized. It is only when you take the trouble to think the thing through, to apply it to concrete cases, to test it pragmatically by the test of consequences, that you discover that to recognize the above distinctions leads to sense, and that to overlook them leads else- where. The answer to our question, May a realist be a pragmatist of the ontological or humanistic brand? is a qualified affirmative. We de- fined humanism as the doctrine that (1) what world we shall know is determined largely by our specifically human faculties, and (2) the world that we come to know in this way is the real world and not a distorted image of it. We have tried to show that if we inter- pret humanism to mean that cognition is creative and that the reality cognized is plastic or amorphous with respect to cognition, then humanism is incompatible with realism and is false in its own right; while if we interpret it (as we have a right to do) as meaning that cognition is selective, and that reality has a rich variety of aspects from which we choose for recognition and elabora- tion those which best meet our human needs, then humanism as so interpreted implie.s realism, and is true in its own right. Logical Pragmatism.-We come at last to that fourth form of the pragmatic doct.rine to which all three of the leaders of pragmatism may perhaps be said to subscribe equally. The defender of instru- mentalism, the defender of the conception of truth as the immediate experience of verification, and the defender of humanism, appear to</page><page sequence="8">568 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY be united in the belief that pragmatism does at least offer a new and fruitful method of testing the truth of propositions. "The truth of a proposition depends upon the value of its consequences." Let us begin by noting briefly the apparent ambiguities of this statement, ambiguities which have, I think, been convincingly and exhaustively analyzed by Professor Lovejoy in his article on The Thirteen Pragmatisms (see this JOURNAL, VOl. V., pp. 5-12; 29-39)-: Are the "consequences," whose value is to be the test of truth, con- sequences of the thing asserted in the proposition, or consequences of holding the proposition? I think it is the latter which is usually meant. Are the consequences that test a proposition to have value for society generally or only for the individuals who may hold the proposition? I suppose the pragmatist would answer: sometimes one, sometimes the other, preferably both. The more the benefits and the more the people benefited, the more likely the truth of the proposition. Are we to mean by "value" theoretical value for further knowledge, or practical value for conduct? and if the latter, then are the beliefs which satisfy our higher emotional nature and help us to live serenely and happily, to be adjudged as true, or only those beliefs which preserve our physical existence and make more efficient our reactions to our environment? I fancy that the pragmatist receives such questions with a certain impatience. He might reply that he meant by value each and all of the things mentioned and that we had no business to try to pin him down to a choice. What satisfies our cognitive needs would, of necessity, sooner or later satisfy our practical needs. And just in so far as a belief meets a practical need, whether of the spiritual or of the material sort, just in so far has it the value that indicates truth. So be it, let us take the pragmatic principle in the broadest, loosest, and most generous sense and not plague the pragmatist by putting to him cases of propositions, the acceptance of which would satisfy practical needs but not theoretical needs, or esthetic needs but not ma- terial needs, or my needs but not your needs. In short we will refrain from the tempting and easy task of pressing him to acknowledge some criterion for evaluating all these very dis- tinct types of value, and allow him to say that the more value of any kind and to anybody that the consequences of a propo- sition have, the more likely are they to indicate its truth. There is, however, one possible interpretation of the pragmatic crite- rion which we must definitely bar out. We are not to under- stand the statement to mean that the valuable consequences flow- ing from a proposition are the same as its truth, or a cause of its truth, but only that they are a reliable index or symptom of its</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 569 truth. We bar out this interpretation because we have treated it at length, and by itself, under the caption of "psychological pragma- tism." We attempted there to show that the identification of a truth with the criterion or process by which it is tested, led to nothing but confusion. "Valuable consequences" is not to con- note "truth" in our present discussion, but is to be treated as a new test or criterion for determining truth, into the validity and impli- cations of which we are now to examine. Our examination need not be long. We may admit at once that generally, and in the long run, most of the true propositions have consequences of practical value, and that most of the propositions having consequences of practical value are true. There is, in short, a considerable degree of correlation between propositions that are useful and those that are true. This correlation does not hold, how- ever, between degree of utility and degree of certainty. The propo- sition that there are four flies on the table where I am writing pos- sesses a very high degree of certainty for me and for any one else who has confidence in my veracity. Its utility, and the utility of its consequences, either practical or theoretical, social or individual, material or spiritual, is assuredly very small in amount. I will not say that it has absolutely no utility, for I am using it as an illustra- tion, and then, too, it is conceivable that some stray entomologist might wander in here and find it valuable to accept the proposition. Or again, the proposition "15,554 is divisible by 7" is virtually, if not quite, certain; its degree of utility is so small as to be negligible. Either of these propositions has a far higher degree of certainty and an infinitely lower degree of utility than Newton's laws, or than the atomic theory. But notwithstanding the complete break-down of the pragmatic criterion if interpreted quantitatively, it retains a certain sporadic and occasional value. It is, however, so far from being the sole criterion of truth that we never dream of using it practically and concretely except as a last resort. In the case of the belief in immortality, for example, we may imagine a man who has come to the conclusion that all the logical evidence, for and against, comes to a perfect balance, but that the practical value in matters of con- duct and sentiment, to himself and to others, of holding the belief is very considerable. Such a person might be justified in concluding that for these pragmatic reasons it was a little more likely to be true than false. Yet even here I imagine that most of us would regard it as more dignified and honest to come out with a frank expression of scepticism rather than to save oneself from that unsatisfactory state by clutching at the pragmatic straw. But if the pragmatist really takes his criterion seriously and regards it as having anything more than a meager measure of ab-</page><page sequence="10">570 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY stract intellectualistic validity, why does he not test it pragmatically? Why does he not point us to concrete cases in which it is practically valuable to test the truth of a proposition by its practical value? When we consider the extent to which pragmatists fulminate against the abstract and the purely theoretical and eulogize the practical, the concrete, and the empirical, it is a matter for real wonderment that their own writings in defense of the concrete are themselves so ab- stract. If an empirically-minded person believed that he had dis- covered an important criterion for testing the truth of propositions, wouldn't you suppose that the very first and most natural thing for him to do would be to draw up, in good Baconian fashion, a statis- tical table of all the typically different cases of propositions having useful consequences and observe: (1) What proportion of them were truie. (2) What proportion of those that were true had been found to be true by a study of the utility of their consequences. I hazard the guess that any such statistical tabulation would show: (1) That (a) the great majority of useful propositions are true, but that (b) there is still a goodly number of beliefs, such, for example, as the overestimation of your friends' virtues and the underestimation of your own, which are very useful and not at all true. (2) That of the useful propositions which are true (a) the great majority could only be verified by other evidence than that of the utility of their consequences, though (b) a considerable number could be verified both pragmatically and otherwise, while (c) a very select few could be tested only by the pragmatic criterion. I am not concerned to defend the correctness of this hypothetical table. I wish only to call attention to the really extraordinary fact that no one of the prag- matists has cared enough about his own theory of the correlation of utility and truth, to nmake any kind of decent, serious, inductive test either of its value or of its validity. But as to the implications for or against realism of this fourth type of pragmatism-I do not see that there are any at all. The pragmatic criterion might be true or false and realism might be true or false-all quite independently. And now finally to conclude: The terms of our question, Alay a realist be a pragmatist? have been defined, and the question itself has been answered under four headings corresponding to the four theories that the term pragmatism appeared to cover. We found that (1) a realist might be a pragmatist of the biological or instru- inentalist type, and that an instrumentalist, to make his theory con- sistent, would have to adopt a realistic standpoint. (2) Psycholog- ical pragmatism, or the theory that truth is identical with verification, was definitely subjectivistic and, hence, incompatible with realism. (3) Ontological pragmatism or humanism was susceptible of two in-</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC MET'HODS 571 terpretations, one of which is idealistic, the other realistic. (4) Logical pragmatism, or the pragmatic criterion for testing the truth of propositions by their utility, was an ambiguous theory, of dubious value, lacking empirical verification, and without any a pparent bearing upon the question of realism.
