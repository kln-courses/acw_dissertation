In this way I try to supplement and strengthen the anthropology that Cassirer formulated in AN ESSAY ON MAN. Finally I discuss the historical character and value of this anthropology.

Within the studies and discussions on Wittgenstein's philosophy there has emerged a school of interpreters that opts for a so-called resolute reading of Wittgenstein's works. This school holds that one should not try to grasp what the various texts of his really state, argue or declare. There is no objective content to the texts that one should try to capture formulaically. The point is not to champion the relativity of possible interpretations, but to emphasize the fact that Wittgenstein thought of the writing of philosophical texts as an activity, namely as an activity directed towards certain kinds of readers. This goes for all phases of Wittgenstein's writing, though in the hands of the later Wittgenstein it turns into the idea of philosophy as a sort of therapy, which is exercised on the reader and performed by the writer. 1 1 The first account of a resolute reading of Wittgenstein is usually attributed to Diamond (1991), although Cavell (1959) had taken a first step in that direction. Variations on the approach also date back to Waismann (1968). In my view, the main proponents of a resolute reading of Wittgenstein are Cora Diamond, James Conant, Juliett Floyd, Gordon Baker, Daniéle Moyal-Sharrock, Christoffer Gefwert, and Rom Harré. S.

But still, the point of the resolute readers applies just as much to Cassirer as it does to Wittgenstein. As I will argue below, because of the encyclopaedic nature of Cassirer's writings, there is a sense in which the content of any of his texts is open-ended and relative to a variety of other texts, both his own and others'. Understanding Cassirer means understanding his texts in relation to a very wide range of different kinds of texts that are written by a very heterogeneous group of scholars. According to a resolute reader, the audience for an assessment of Cassirer's works is not given. Instead, all sorts of new audiences should arise. This is why the widespread tradition of viewing Cassirer's texts as embodying some sort of generalization of either Kantian, Leibnitzian, Hegelian, Goethean or Humboldtian frameworks should - for very principled reasons - be avoided. Such interpretations may well be very deep and sophisticated and add to various schools of thought. But the historical, cultural situation in which Cassirer found himself is rather the following. There are to begin certain developments in the sciences, the arts, and religion. The philosopher now recognizes that these developments embody different generalizations (or just modifications) of certain schools of thought. Consequently the normative task for the philosopher is to elaborate some lines of communication between these different generalizations. This brings no extra, neither supra-development nor a new Meta school. It only brings a vision for holding the many new intellectual land- scapes together. And so there nevertheless emerges a "Wittgensteinian situation Cassirer would be seen by a resolute reader as a performing intellectual who does not simply deliver a set of messages and arguments. His agenda is instead to suggest how, for instance, the physicist, the biologist, and the psychologist could sit down and initi- ate a fruitful intellectual conversation. In contrast to traditional Kantian thought, there is no given "rational" contribution from any of the established intellectual traditions to the unity or conjunction of these. The job of the philosopher is to provide such a rational perspective, in ever new ways , in relation to ever new fields of knowledge. I think Cassirer scholars tend to fall short in noticing this character of his works. They usually believe that Cassirer meant to deliver some very general, eternal philo- sophical statements. The non-resolute reader believes that Cassirer wanted to and succeeded in making a particular, distinct contribution to philosophy. But to the reso- lute reader's mind, Cassirer did the opposite. He wrote on the problem of knowledge only in order to teach us that there is no such thing, but that a certain set of problems have been reformulated time and again as the history of thought has progressed. He did the same thing with any other crucial philosophical concept and problem, and below we shall for instance see the many different ways in which he scrutinized basic notions such as "symbol" or "form". How then can one read Cassirer's own texts as striving to possess an absolute standing, in view of all the other texts he wants us to read with a sense of historical relativity? If my point is granted, it makes little sense to talk about such things as "Cassirer's position" or "view" on certain, basic philosophical problems. There is no corpus of viewpoints that any Cassirer scholar ought to grasp. Instead, one should, according to the resolute reader, understand Cassirer as providing, potentially, a series of "voices" that can be of value and interest, in different ways, in certain contexts in so far as these voices come to communicate with one another. Springer</page><page sequence="3">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 95 Consequently, in this paper I will elaborate a certain resolute reading - among several possible - of the anthropological dimensions of Cassirer's works, which addresses a broad, heterogeneous audience within modern philosophy of culture and sociology, an audience that might be brought to make use of Cassirer's thoughts, because it is already inspired by such writers as Wittgenstein, Bourdieu, Merleau- Ponty, Clifford Geertz, Tim Ingold, Ernst Wolfgang Orth, and Oswald Schwemmer. 2 A philosophical encyclopaedia revisited The first claim of our resolute reader is that Cassirer's works - seen as a whole - must be read in "encyclopaedic" fashion. By this our reader means that it should be rec- ognized as a historical fact that there is a variety of what, in logical terms, could be called self-justifying intellectual disciplines, traditions, and forms of expertise, includ- ing the individual sciences, the established religions, and forms of art. Consequently, the second point of the resolute reader is that there is nothing called "philosophy" over and above the other forms of expertise. "Philosophy" is not even one specific intellectual tradition within the range of such. However, because the various forms of expertise influence and challenge each other, there is a call for a number of special intellectual endeavours, and those endeavours make up, our reader claims, what Cas- sirer called "the philosophy of symbolic forms". In principle, the interplay and modal interrelations between the various intellectual disciplines, as such, constantly entertain historical change. So there is also in that sense nothing called the given tasks and meth- ods of "philosophy". Accordingly, questions about the "unity", or "union", between the various fields of experience and knowledge have to be reformulated and reinter- preted as such fields develop. Accordingly, there is no given philosophical question "what is Man?" The character and content of such a question changes as the sciences, the arts, the religions, the politics, and the technologies develop. And what is more, the indications of a possible answer will vary as well. Perhaps, sometime in the future, it might be significant to claim things like "Man is a special Robot or Cyborg", or "there are more than two sexes" (given certain genetic and technological modifications of the human body). The point of all this is not that we, as philosophers, should refrain from posing "big" questions like "what is Man?" The point is that philosophical reflection must begin, as it were, "outside of itself". So the resolute reader notices that already within the various intellectual disciplines themselves we find a series of reflections, which we - without saying too much - can call "philosophical". So, on our table we have a series of views and problems that are raised within the various fields of expertise. Phy- sicians, biologists, psychologists, teachers and preachers, the many artists, politicians, and historians, all these fine people, and many more, provide reflected, historically justified, reasonable views on "Man". The book An Essay on Man is in effect noth- ing but Cassirer's account of these historically cultivated views and how they are interrelated. The book "leaves us" where religion, art, history, and science happen to leave us. The book carries no claim over and above the given, historical condition of mankind. Cassirer could in that sense have used Wittgenstein's two expressions, that this is merely "how I find the world", and that "philosophy leaves everything as it ^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">96 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 is". The book An Essay on Man is in effect Cassirer' s own resolute reading of his intellectual production. Now, what the philosophically reflective person "finds", where he leaves us, is not in confrontation with a list of facts, but instead with a list of norms and tasks. We are left with a set of reasons for change, without a strict plan for where to go and how. The philosophical cry of the resolute reader sounds: "You can all prepare yourself better in respect to the aspirations you might happen to have". This is as such a general cry, and it is at this point that we can, with Cassirer, begin to assess a deeper, continuing "philosophical voice". This voice reminds us of all the many similar cries that we have experienced throughout our cultural history. This voice reminds us how certain developments within myth, religion, art, science, and technology more or less implic- itly led to a transformation in what we can call the "temporal horizon" of various human endeavours, in that the very relations between past, present, and future were restructured. They were reconstructed not the least because the various functions of feelings, perceptions, intuitions, representations, thoughts, works, action-types, insti- tutions, linguistic expressions, and artefacts changed. Consequently, a major task of any "philosophy" will be an examination of such possible functions. The resolute reader takes this part of Cassirer's works to be a contribution to what he called "the problem of knowledge".2 And so the resolute reader underscores how a "critique of knowledge" - the examination of these possible functions - is already a contribution to a "critique of culture". 3 A resolute step back to basics When English-speaking philosophers address German philosophical topics, the question soon arises, "but is it exegesis or paraphrase?" Well, if this is an unavoid- able dichotomy, the following is paraphrase. But maybe there is a sense in which a paraphrase may be formulated so as to add substantially to the understanding and rec- ognition of a set of texts? The resolute reader risks the endeavour of trying to formulate such a paraphrase, initially by presenting a very broadly formulated framework for Cassirer's philosophical anthropology. A first metaphysical remark for a resolute reader of Cassirer could well be cosmo- logical to the effect that human beings are spirit. One could try to define or circumscribe this notion of our being Geist by quoting Hegel or Kierkegaard, say, or one could look for some formulation in certain papers of Cassirer that deal explicitly with questions of "Spirit and Life". But the resolute reader thinks that any such attempt to be precise will lead to a notion that is too abstract and formal. It wouldn't so to speak make metaphysi- cal sense. One must be able to formulate a broader, open, notion, such as the following: the individual human being is always part of a "unity of being and becoming" that supersedes what can be called the individual person's life. Second, our being Spirit means that there is something called a person's awareness of the world, an awareness that by necessity is "troubled", in the sense that (most) people (most of the time) 2 As is well-known, Cassirer was continually occupied with that problem, writing four volumes on how to reconstruct the history of both philosophy and the sciences (Cassirer 1994). Springer</page><page sequence="5">Synthese (2011) 179:93-113 97 cannot but try to reorient themselves, and do so by means of creating and producing a variety of expressions, actions, works, and deeds. In this respect, human awareness is the awareness of an "I" that faces both a "world" and faces "others" (faces "you and you and you"). Such is the reality of things, and such is the historical situation of the human being. We are, each of us, nothing but a Gemüt , a source for a bundle of "ener- gies", which we, more or less freely, can bring forth and thus put to work within the dynamics of things. Not the least, we manage to produce feelings, emotions, intuitions, and pictures in the light of which the world takes on a different shape. For the resolute reader, we have hereby not declared, absolutely, what the Human Being is. Instead we have provided the first part of a platform upon which we can recognize Cassirer's texts as inviting certain audiences. A second basic feature of Cassirer's anthropology, for our reader, concerns the metaphysics of experience. The resolute reader might choose the following summary statement: we are always posi- tioned within "worlds". Our reader would here make a distinction between being thus positioned, and being "situated" as a person. "Positions" are positions within reality. They express the "place" from where one experiences one's surroundings. Such places are parts of frameworks, or grids, like those allocating a spatial position, a physical position towards other organic bodies or some sort of presence towards other peo- ple. The resolute reader relates this to the active ability to move and act within such organized manifolds and thus anticipate various forms of experiences in certain ways. The main point for the resolute reader is here that our presence is always mediated by certain structures of phenomena. The very possibility of there being a phenomenal world is conditioned by these structures. The resolute reader notices that such worlds, as we shall see, can be anything from the Funktionskreise in the biological sense of von Uexkiill, over the ordinary social organization of things into recognisable material objects to the theoretically posited world(s) of modern science. We not only "have" or "share" such a variety of worlds; we uphold them by means of productive efforts , like language, technique, emotional expressions, and conceptually informed representa- tions. The resolute reader underscores that we take position of reality in these ways by bringing forth and maintaining certain kinds of shared world. The next feature of being human to be assessed by the resolute reader is that we are situated as persons within social and cultural settings, as members of tribes, families, institutions, villages, cities, countries, and other forms of communion. Here, there are no inter-subjective relations in abstraction from the concrete ways in which people can engage with one another on the background of a shared "space" of action. The resolute reader points out that there must be some sort of "spatiality", such as various aesthetic, mythical, or geometrical forms, that conditions the possibility for engaging in certain kinds of activity. In this respect, what is at issue is the variety of ways in which subjectivity engages in forms of objectification , because their relations to things mediate the push and pull between persons.3 The dynamics of the situation of persons is already part of the dynamics of our relation to things and features within our surroundings. Consequently, as persons we are always situated within a variety of spaces. "Being situated" within 3 Cassirer (1993b). â Springer</page><page sequence="6">98 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 such spaces means, for the resolute reader, being actively engaged within a Gliederung , a differentiation and integration, of possible forms of "participation and division" within the communion with other people. Recall that these characterizations of our being human are not to be seen as one definite bundle of truths. They are more what Wittgenstein called reminders, namely a set of remarks that many times, too many times, needs to be put to scholars that are tempted to say something different , for instance scholars that reduce our being human to an intellectual or moral capacity. As such these reminders have a kind of pre-given, imagined audience. 4 The spiritual integration of the notions of "form", "symbol", and "life" The resolute reader notices a distinction made in the anthology Geist und Leben. In that text, Cassirer deals in a very abstract historical manner with some basic dual- ities of Western philosophical thought, like that of nature-spirit or nature-freedom as well as Descartes' original duality between the two kinds of substances, mate- rial and non-material. Cassirer makes the case that all such "previous" dualities have been associated with certain ideas about "energies of effect" ( Energie des Wirkens). By contrast, Cassirer now brings forth an alternative idea of "energies of formation" ( Energie des Bildens). We are told that this alternative shifts the focal point away from "potentialities of being" to a functional-dynamic view of the very relation between certain basic kinds of process (i.e. the formation of symbols) and its products (i.e. produced forms seen as active-dynamic instances of a form-position [Form-Setzung]). Consequently, "energy of formation" concerns the formation and function of "forms", a formation that is brought forth by means of a "symbolic" expression. For the resolute reader there is a theme here. Cassirer calls it "mediated activity" ( mittelbare Tätigkeit ).4 One example, but not the first and primary example, but an example that is very clear, is Cassirer's view of technique as such a mediated activity. We refer to a form of activity as "technical" if we see it as a way to let a set of items and circumstances "stand out there". By a technical effort we manage to let things be Heraus- gestellt . Consequently, the resolute reader underscores that such a formative process involves more than imagination (Vor Stellung) and presentation (Darstellung). The Stellung provided by the formative process is not fixed, it is not a logical position in the mathematical sense in which the numeral 4 is placed in relation to other numer- als. The technically produced item, for instance a tool or a machine, "stands there" ready for use, ready for all kinds of different uses. As such, it stands there as pregnant with a variety of different meanings, functions, and applications. This is not only a characteristic of technical activity; it is the character of symbolic production as such, the character of making (items that make) sense. It is the character of the production of (functional) forms and of the positioning of forms within a variety of circumstances. This was the theme. The point for the resolute reader, in considering this theme, is that the distinction spirit-life does not mark a duality, but marks a unity, namely the functional unity of the production of forms in the sense just explained. Again, we 4 Cassirer (1993a, p. 46). â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 99 see how a general theme is voiced through Cassirer's text, not as a final goal in itself but instead in order to address a certain kind of philosopher, namely, in this case, the dualist who thinks that an immaterial, non-localized, and undetectable spirit belongs to a different realm of being than concrete life processes and life manifestations. Now, if we look at the paper "Zur Logik des Symbolbegriffes", we are told that the concept of a "symbol" is a complex concept that has no given historical "definition".5 It is related to the very distinction between a sign and what this sign denotes. It is also related to the very act of "relating" something to something else, as well as to certain ideas about semantic notions like "sense" and "truth". And it is even related to questions concerning the relation between matter and form. Accordingly, the resolute reader notices a variety of possible audiences in respect to these remarks. Our reader can now turn to another of Cassirer's papers called "Begriff der sym- bolischen Form im Aufbau der Geisteswissenschaften". She notices that the concept of a symbol is associated with the idea of there being "directions" of awareness. The resolute reader thus recognizes that for Cassirer, it will always be too narrow to con- sider such directions only in the particular. Our reader might therefore associate this remark with the more technical definition of a "symbolic form" as a spiritual energy through which a given sign attains a meaningful content in its concrete application.6 Consequently there are different angles on how to assess the crucial notion of "form". A resolute reader might therefore circumscribe this notion in three aspects. First, transcending a more narrow semantic view of a given "sign", where a "sign" is seen only in relation to a capacity for denoting singular items, the resolute reader wants us to learn to see the sign as a "symbol" by learning to see the "whole" of the possible applications of that sign. We thereby learn to regard the sign as a spiritual act and not just as an "activity of the understanding". A specific point to put to some philosophers is that such spiritual acts will unfold in specific spiritual directions but always so that other possible directions are "kept in mind".7 The sign thus becomes symbolic when it is seen in relation to the possibility of positioning a form within the life of spirit. The spiritual application of signs and the positioning of forms ( Formsetzung ) are two sides of the same coin, we say if we resolutely point to this spiritual aspect of the notion of a form. However, the positioning of a form is such that it is associated with the power to modify and change that very form. This feature, the destruction of form, is a crucial feature of all symbolic forms but especially of language, since the constant change of grammar is a crucial feature of there being language.8Our reader may resolutely stress this historical focus of Cassirer. A further aspect comes to the fore in the section on "Spirit and Life" in Part IV of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms. Here we find a discussion of the tight connec- tion between the two notions of "life" and "form". There is even a kind of definition or characterization of "life" as meaning, in principle, "the becoming of form". The 5 Cassirer (1969, p. 207). 6 Cassirer (1956, p. 174). 7 Cassirer (1969, p. 177). 8 Cassirer (1993a, pp. 56-57). Springer</page><page sequence="8">100 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 spiritual creation and positioning of forms is seen as a basic feature of our human being, of the human form of life. The human form of life is the life where forms are expressed. And so we see, in a new light, how the pair Spirit - Life does not mark a duality but a unity in the production of forms. The resolute reader thus recognizes that she has to address several issues in order to assess Cassirer's account of his basic notions. There is neither a strict line of argument nor a set list of definitions and statements that she, simply and merely, has to adopt. There are no constitutive concepts and problems on the philosophical horizon of Cas- sirer. The resolute reader should consequently bear that in mind when she turns to the effort of making sense of a further range of "technical core concepts" of Cassirer that we shall try to bring into play below. Just one example will demonstrate our point. It is clear that Cassirer in Part IV of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms tries to relate the topics that we have dealt with so far to the following large philosophical issue; and yet it would be wrong to say that this, finally, is the ultimate question of his philosophy.9 It is in a sense the ultimate question, because it logically is the most general and complex question. It is, so to speak, the question that contains all the other questions. But to the resolute reader, this is just another beginning , another way to see connections and another way of looking harder. It is never the absolutely decisive question. In light of these reservations, it is indeed one of the big issues of "a philosophy of symbolic forms" that assessing the particular symbolic forms, assessing the cultural traditions of myth, religion, art, science, language, and technique, are ways in which an individual life as such becomes visible to itself. Consequently, the various symbolic forms can be interpreted as organs and documents of life itself This is clearly a central view of Cassirer's in Part IV of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms. But to the resolute reader, even such a major point still finds its addressee wanting. 5 Dimensions of meaning-circumstance We have seen that a sign becomes a symbol by being associated with more than strict semantic rules. The sign is, in narrow semantic terms, associated with a kind of reference. However, as a symbol it is part of the continuing embedding and posi- tioning of individual human lives. As such, the sign, as symbol, is a dynamic force in relation to what - in the terms of a resolute reader - could be called a "meaning- circumstance". By this the resolute reader refers to the conjunction of Form-Setzung and Sinn-Gebung. The formation of forms by means of making sense of things is, in sum, a way in which individual people position and situate themselves in relation to their surroundings. Below I will now characterize three dimensions, or features, of such meaning-circumstances in resolute fashion: (i) Symbolic expressive functions (ii) Relations and schemes of order (iii) Monograms of the imagination 9 Cassirer (1996). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthese (2011) 179:93-113 101 6 Symbolic expressive functions As an example of the general account of signs as symbols, we can say that percep- tions - in so far as these carry a sign-function - always are fuelled and enlivened by acts of making sense of given impressions as symbols. Accordingly, perceptions are not impressions but expressions that are shaped through the ways in which a human being orientates herself within a spatio-temporally structured surrounding world. The resolute reader notices that this "symbolic presence" can - in each concrete case - be characterized as "placed" within a manifold spun by two axes, an axis corresponding to "levels of expression" and an axis corresponding to "levels of intuition". The former axis concerns Cassirer's famous distinction between the three "func- tions of expression", and I will come back to that shortly. The latter axis may be seen as a fine structure within the former axis, but as I will explain below it makes sense to see it as an independent axis. For I think that the latter axis concerns what Cassirer called the "original phenomenon of expression" (Cassirer 1985, p. 9), which means the real outcome of any human expression, which again involves a subjective presence or awareness. Consequently, the "levels of intuition" relate to different features of actual phe- nomena that are generated by means of expressions. By contrast, Cassirer invokes his famous distinction between the different functions of symbolic expression as a means of analysing "expressive phenomena". The mention of these three functions of symbolic expression marks a reflective characterization of the relation between the individual human being (that expresses himself) and what the expression "brings forth", i.e. the relation between Äusserung and Tat/Werk. Consequently, for the resolute reader, the various functions of symbolic expression concern the relation between th e fact that a particular person expresses himself and the form that is "placed" (produced) by that expression. One can say that this relation between factual expression and form mediates the possibility of an objective stance within subjectivity. This, then, is to the resolute reader a point of note: that the root of these distinctions comes from Dilthey indicates that the reference to the functions of symbolic expression could be directed at an inquiry concerning the way in which an objective, scientific account of expressions could be formulated.10 The idea of a science of art and culture lurks round the corner. For the resolute reader it is not surprising that the main example of Cassirer in relation to the "levels of intuition" is Goethe's distinction between three forms of aesthetic expression, Nachahmung , Manier , and Stil (mimetic style, skilled style, and artistic style). These three forms of aesthetic expression exemplify three general lev- els of intuitive understanding. The corresponding forms of expression are called the mimetic , analogical , and symbolic forms of expression by Goethe and Cassirer. In the mimetic forms of expression, there are some specific qualities of the things or circumstances to which the expressions refer, that are somewhat copied or echoed. In the analogical form of expression, a reflective subjectivity mediates the reference to the subject matter at issue such that these matters are not merely present to the 10 Dilthey (1958) concerning different "categories of life". Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">102 Synthese (2011) 179:93-113 perceiving subject, but instead placed within a kind of mapping of a range of items. Finally, in the highest symbolic form of expression, the ability to represent things in the analogical sense is raised to an artistic level, where a more or less free subjective effort is revealed. The objects are here presented by means of symbols in a certain fashion and style, which as such mark a unity between subjective efforts and objective posits.11 These different levels of intuition could now be associated in resolute fashion with their corresponding "functions of symbolic expression". So far, we have been talking about these in an abstract sense as relations between factual expression and form, and thus as the possibility of an objective subjective stance. However, there are a variety of ways in which such objective stances can be assessed as cultural functions within a life world. This resolute association comes through most clearly in the first sections of the chapter on language in An Essay on Man. The whole chapter turns out to be an analysis of the relations between an emotional , a formal , and a pragmatic understanding of linguistic phenomena and acts.12 The chapter is for the resolute reader in effect an analysis of how to characterize the various real, expressive phenomena as functions of expression. By referring to emotional, formal, or pragmatic forms of expression we, so to speak, transform the expressions, qua real phenomena, to expressive acts, and so into cultural acts within a life- world. 13 At least, this is how a resolute reader might view Cassirer's agenda and the audience he invites. The resolute reader can now unfold her interpretation of Cassirer, for example, in the following way. A crucial characteristic of the first symbolic expressive function, which is called simply "the expressive function", is that the expressed symbol remains within what can be grasped merely by intuitive means.14 Examples would be charac- teristic features of the world of "primitive man", of the world of myth, and the works within simple, historically early, forms of art. The claim is that a human being - in so far as he lives within "the expressive function" - is at one with his surroundings. The world presents itself as a world filled with life and thus filled with what belongs to life. There is no gap between how men can feel and perceive and how the world is available. Accordingly, there is no gap between how men can experience and deal with the world and what they experience, no gap between know-how and know-what, for the reason that such a primitive life-world is not organized in terms of a propositional know-that. It is precisely the latter that comes with the second symbolic expressive func- tion, the Darstellungsfunktion , the function of presentation. Two main examples of this function are, as indicated, the propositional function of language, and the use 11 See Cassirer (1969, p. 178ff). 12 Cassirer talks in this relation of three phases in the rational understanding of linguistic phenomena, namely the "mythical", "metaphysical", and "pragmatic" accounts of linguistic phenomena. The represen- tatives that Cassirer mentions for these different phases are primitive man, Ionic philosophers of nature, and the Sophists. Below in my characterization of symbolic forms as cultural achievements, I will point back to these representatives. 13 Cassirer's most thorough account of the idea of an expressive function is from the Nachlass : Cassirer (2004). 14 Cassirer (1985, p. 13): "[ ...] bleibt stehen innerhalb des Anschaulich-Fassbaren." Springer</page><page sequence="11">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 103 of "mathematical schemata" within the natural sciences. Other central examples of how an original expressive function transforms itself to a function of representation include the shift when "naming" something turns from being a simple ostensive point- ing to being part of making a list of something, or when works of art are supposed to not only move those that experience them, but are also supposed to show or say something more general. The resolute reader might see the big point in all these cases as lying in the fact that intuition changes from being part of experiences to being a vehicle for experiences. Immediate forms of experience are transformed into medi- ated forms where what we experience is modeled, in the sense of being intuitively re-presented. The last symbolic expressive function, that of "pure meaning", relates to features of grammar, logic, and mathematics. Here, it is no longer intuition that mediates our experiences; instead what mediates is a series of symbolic operations. It is the world of symbols as such that we learn to operate. Exactly at this point, our resolute reader should pause, for there are a couple of general themes that - as a matter of course - come to the fore the very second we address the general notion of symbolic operations. First, there is no way in which any of the particular symbolic expressive functions can work in isolation from each other. They are always at work together . So we talk not about exclusive expressive functions, but about complementary ones. Second, any such complementary co-operation only takes place within a specific symbolic form, say, within language or within technique. To take the latter, one feature of Cassirer's view on technique is the production of tools for which there is no predetermined use. The possible forms of use are open-ended. Now, recall that we should say something analogous concerning all symbolic forms. That is a main reason why we should be care- ful when we speak about the very idea of logic, grammar, or mathematical reasoning. Like Wittgenstein, we should say that there is no logic, grammar, nor mathematical thought - no such formal operations - in abstraction from the open-ended, possible forms of non- formal application.15 In short, very basic issues in the philosophy of logic, mathematics, semantics, and thought arise. For the resolute reader, the point is not to settle basic problems within these philosophical disciplines. The point is to understand in what sense Cassirer addresses various proponents of views within these disciplines. Our suggestion is that such addressees are invited to look at symbolic operations as "inserted" into cultural his- torical settings to the effect that the focus shifts from looking at symbolic operations as epistemic achievements, in the abstract, to seeing them as practical achievements that are part of the re-figuration of a human life-world. The technical term of "pure meaning", that particular function of symbolic expression, should therefore not be associated with some "highest" or "complete" form of expression but instead be rec- ognized as a strong form of expression. When people manage to formulate a formal symbolism, in science and elsewhere, what they achieve is a means for introducing discipline, method, or goal-directed investigations, all of which add to and transform 15 This is a general theme of most of Wittgenstein's later works, from 1933 and on, but finds ultimate expression in Wittgenstein (1967, IV, §2, p. 133e): "It is the use outside mathematics, and so the meaning of the signs, that makes the sign-game into mathematics." ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">104 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 a given social setting. The achievement of discipline and method can never be a final goal in itself. So the resolute reader concludes that the analysis of symbolic expression in terms of functions direct the reader's attention towards questions about the cultural transformation of an intellectual landscape, and does not merely add to given academic philosophical disciplines. 7 Relations of order The resolute reader notices another thread in Cassirer's work concerning the phi- losophy of mathematics. This thread has two sides to it. First there is the idea of a mathematical generalization concerning given forms of order. Say we begin with the Aristotelian idea of a system of categories and systems of classification, then with the introduction of the mathematical notions of differential and integrating functions we get a more complex idea of a functional manifold, and further, after the development of modern arithmetic and the possibility of reformulating all Euclidean and Riemann- ian geometrical spaces and forms in the terms of arithmetic, it made sense for Felix Klein and his successors to want us to see mathematics as a continuing transforma- tion and generalization of previously given forms of manifolds and calculus.16 Such transformations, however, do not arise out of the blue. They are usually developed and assessed as a productive force and kernel within the development of the math- ematical natural sciences. So this first dimension, to be noticed resolutely, concerns levels of formal complexity and the according functional sophistication within specific empirical applications of the various symbolisms. Another dimension concerns what is attributed an order. In An Essay on Man we read for instance that ethics imposes an "order of action", science imposes an "order of thought" and the arts an "order within the apprehension". It is thus fair to say that such "orders" express various forms of media or symbolic mediation to the effect that the positing of a cultural order is mediated by a certain totality of possible structures, by a certain kind of Gestalt. Consequently, the resolute reader notices that there arises the ambition of attaining a "structural view on culture": Man's outstanding characteristic, his distinguishing mark, is not his metaphys- ical or physical nature, it is his work. It is this work, it is the system of human activities that determines the circle of "humanity". Language, myth, religion, art, science, history are the constituents, the various sections of this circle [...] All human works arise under particular historical and sociological conditions. But we could never understand these special conditions unless we were able to grasp the general structural principles underlying all these works. In our study of language, art and myth, the problem of meaning takes precedence over the prob- lem of historical development [...] this structural view of culture must precede the merely historical view.17 16 See the first part on mathematics in Cassirer ( 1 999). The strongest argument for the view is, on my view, delivered by Waismann in Waismann (1996). 17 Cassirer (1992, pp. 68-69). Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 105 The resolute reader thus highlights one of the facets of the idea of symbolic forms, namely that they embody structural principles for the generation of what we called "meaning-circumstance". Now, since the positing of a structural manifold - a set of relations of ordered relations - is, in mathematics, what constitutes a space , the reso- lute reader wants to regard the invocation and outcome of the various symbolic forms as a means to configure what might be called culturally expressive spaces. This is a notion that makes such broader terms as "the Renaissance", "modernity", or "the West" more accessible as concepts to be rationally scrutinized. The development of the symbolic forms of myth, art, language, technique etc. are consequently seen as constitutive features of the formation of expressive spaces that are posited in ways that would not be possible otherwise. 8 Monograms of the imagination The positing of expressive spaces marks a way in which to anticipate our surroundings. This is for the resolute reader in affinity with the original Kantian idea of schematiza- tion. Kant formulated these first and foremost in order to "ground" the workings and rules of the understanding within a specific application of the categories to reality. This is for the resolute reader the cornerstone of Kant's natural philosophy. The possibility that the categories apply to reality is - on this account - at one with the principles for tracing kinetic and dynamical gravitational relationships, i.e. the geometrical rep- resentation of motions in space and time by means of a coordinate system and the according representation of the distribution of gravitational forces in space-time. As such, this is a schematization of an intuitive empirical or phenomenal world, which in effect constitutes a method for the representation of mechanical forms of physi- cal change. Consequently, for the resolute reader, the achievement of a schematization may in general be assessed as a method for representing, and thus anticipating , certain forms of change. It is the uniformity of the range of possible representations that is crucial. All sig- nificant forms of physical change - within a given field of experience - are depicted according to the same principles of intuitive construction. The resolute reader thus notices that it only makes sense to search for a "generalization", and thus also modifi- cation of, the idea of a schematism - a generalization made so as to cover all kinds of experience - if it makes sense to invoke a broader notion of " uniformity " than strictly speaking belongs to formal mathematics. One example could be artistic style, another a technical focus on functionality, or an ethical view on actions as based on motives. The resolute reader accordingly must be able to assess the fact - if it is a fact - that men do indeed possess the ability to formulate such broader "fields of forms" where, if not uniformity in a strict sense, instead another systematic kind of "form-relation" between different kinds of form is available for the mediation of human experiences. The resolute reader notices that one character of such form-fields is the possibility of producing "markers", which are not, as in the original mechanical sense, Merkmale proper. In the generalized sense, "markers" merely mean that there are ways of positing objects within the various fields of experience. Our reader notices in this relation how Cassirer sees an intimate link between the emergence of language and the development Springer</page><page sequence="14">106 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 of new forms of objective representation.18 The use of language within the various symbolic forms implies in different ways the "erection" of a world-of-objects that inhabits the appropriate fields of experience. The point is not just that there emerges a "different" set of such objects in respect to the different fields. For the resolute reader, the point is more that the positing of objects has a different function within the various fields. For example, the positing of objects in a technical sense means to engage in a special kind of "preparation" towards an open ended series of actions, whereas an artistic presentation places the objects as a manifestation of certain forms of human concerns. 9 Subjectivity and self-liberation At this stage in her account, the resolute reader has unmasked some of the pillars in the philosophical building that Cassirer tries to erect. Each of these pillars would for the non-resolute reader count as interesting in themselves as examples of problems and considerations concerning philosophical views that are formulated by certain masters of philosophy. By contrast, the resolute reader sees each of the points as a means for making the individual themes available to a new and wider intellectual audience. What is more, the resolute reader invites such audiences to be sensitive to the ways in which, if not all, then a large group of the previous themes may be brought together and inserted into a more concrete historio-cultural assessment of certain possible con- texts of discussion. The resolute reader thus wants to transform a whole landscape of intellectual inquiry into a concrete, relevant diagnosis of certain features of our time. However, as we shall see, the resolute reader does not have the first word in this effort, she has the last, after we have acknowledged the similar contributions of other intellectuals such as artists and historians. To begin, the resolute reader notices that for Cassirer, there are no independent "subjects".19 The individual human being is like a charged test-particle that can be embedded in a variety of different electro-magnetic fields such that this embedding has an impact on the re-configuration of the field. We do neither have the Cartesian self-subsisting subject nor the empiricist-liberal individual who can store in his mind a long set of experiences and act according to personally generated desires, motives, and reasons that propel the individual person's actions. The "subject" is not such an independent centre from which knowledge, action, and thought springs. Neither is the individual human being merely a medium for a transcending world-spirit or in any other sense for a historical process. There is no cultural history over and above the reality that is given, and only given, in and through the experiences and actions of individual human beings. In that sense, we have a radical view on subjectivity and individuality. We have a position stronger than "methodological" individualism. However, we should not regard the individual person as free in a radical poetic sense, as if anyone were fully free to do whatever happens to be that person's will, taste, or ambition. The freedom of anybody has conditions and limits, and here it makes sense 18 Cassirer (1985, p. 126). 19 Cassirer (1993b, p. 214). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="15">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 107 for the resolute reader to say that many people, in many kinds of circumstances, share the same limits and conditions for their personal freedom. The resolute reader could now mention that, for Cassirer, the various symbolic forms, in their interplay, carry an important cultural function, namely that of man* s progressive self-liberation. This is to say that the continuing generation of new mean- ing-circumstances within the culturally expressive spaces is both a fixation of new conditions of freedom - and as such a self imposed non-freedom - and a liberation from former such self-imposed conditions. In principle, the space of possibilities for the individual human being is open-ended and men can in many ways change that space and reflect on how and why to do so. In that sense, the ongoing making avail- able of possibilities is in effect a way in which man "searches for himself'. The resolute reader notices that Cassirer, in line with this, claims that "self-knowledge is the highest aim of philosophical inquiry" and says that any stage of culture always involves some "crisis" in our self-knowledge.20 However, the resolute reader would stress that one should not exaggerate this statement, for it says nothing about the ideals - like clarity, self-transparency, and self- respect - that some philosophers believe are normatively associated with self-under- standing. Our reader only claims, as it were, that man is "troubled" by his knowledge of himself. How man is troubled is a different story in relation to different kinds of socially and culturally framed personal situations. The point for the resolute reader, here, is only that the general ability to generate ever new forms of understanding goes with an interest in profiling and reshaping our self-knowledge, and that this effort does not proceed as a pure "epistemic technique". This may sound a bit happy-go-lucky, and the resolute reader will sense a darker nuance in the way in which Cassirer expresses the views uttered in the very conclusion and final remark of An Essay on Man : Human culture as a whole may be described as the process of man's progressive self-liberation. Language, art, religion, science, are various phases in this pro- cess. In all of them man discovers and proves a new power - a power to build up a world of his own, an "ideal" world. [And here the resolute reader notices that the quotation takes on a darker nuance.] Philosophy cannot give up its search for a fundamental unity in this ideal world. But it does not confound this unity with simplicity. It does not overlook the tensions and frictions, the strong contrasts and conflicts between the various powers of man. These cannot be reduced to a common denominator. They tend in different directions and obey different principles. [The resolute reader marks that the darker tone shifts back to a more positive angle, but not without some reservation.] But this multiplicity and disparateness does not denote discord or disharmony. All these functions complete and complement one another. Each one opens up a new horizon and shows us a new aspect of humanity. The dissonant is in 20 Cassirer (1992, p. 1). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="16">108 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 harmony with itself; the contrasts are not mutually exclusive, but interdependent: "harmony in contrariety, as in the case of the bow and the lyre.21 The resolute reader realizes what Cassirer's darker tone does not imply when compared to other philosophical views. There is no indication of a grand metaphysical or otherwise universal misery or negativity. There is no negative dialectic, no Angst , no alienation that marks the cultural-historical development of mankind throughout. There are also no general bewitchments of understanding or continuing forms of con- fusion and bewilderment, nor unavoidable forms of unhappiness and melancholy. This all indicates a variety of possible audiences. The resolute reader might wish that Cas- sirer had been more explicit on what drives cultural history though, for we are neither allowed to say that men are always characterized by features such as curiosity, wonder, dissatisfaction, need, or certain kinds of hope - such as reaching divinity or reuniting with nature. We can say no more than what is already a characteristic teleological feature of the various symbolic forms. Consequently, the resolute reader asks herself if there is a sort of historical under- standing, an assessment of the history of culture that, so to speak, makes a platform for a certain view concerning the current historical situation of mankind. If the pres- ent situation for Cassirer is not only an outcome of history, but is even a historically justified outcome, the resolute reader will have discovered what would be a suitable future audience for Cassirer. Our reader will have discovered in what sense Cassirer's is a philosophy for the future. This is the path our resolute reading will now pursue. 10 The resolute character of a number of symbolic forms First, on a certain resolute view, Cassirer's general picture of primitive and religious man is the picture of a human being that "rises" over and above the world of animals. That special creature aims at finding his place within a wilderness and strives to be secure, and live within established and settled conditions. In this respect, man seeks survival, order, and security. Second, Cassirer's view on myth and religion, at least in their original forms, seems to imply that these forms of cultural existence concern more the effort to make sense of one's own life than wonder about a trans-human reality. With the development of the different forms of art, and the growing influence of the second kind of symbolic expressive function, the Darstellungsfunktion , and consequently with a more distant positing of objects outside of the immediate world of intuition, there emerges also a more speculative attitude towards things. The hope for the future is no longer mere survival and the maintenance of a given cultural order. These early civilizations begin to map items in their surroundings, develop categories of things, and investigate why things happen as they do. With the natural philosophy of early Greek/Ionic culture, men even began to wonder about the general principles behind all forms of being. Spirit set men on a course which pointed outside of the given social settings, which in effect also meant the collapse of belief in both the personal gods of Greece and 21 Cassirer (1992, p. 228). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 109 the functional gods of Rome. With Christianity the link between society and earthly life, on the one hand, and a general understanding of human life had been cut. Men no longer lived the earthly life as their true and secure home, but lived instead merely in settings that, at best, could prepare for and lead the way to the true heaven. It was believed that the true human world was not yet realized. This is a basic existential mood, which in later times takes many different cultural forms in the Renaissance, early modernity, mature modernity, and late modernity. For the resolute reader, the role of technique, then, is not least of all the effort to make sure that we are indeed on a right path. With technique we do not only save the crops for the winter, we prepare for the future in a much more substantial sense. The use and understanding of tools did not arise first with Christianity, but the Chris- tian order and the idea of an instrumental approach to farming and other forms of production and distribution of goods fit well together. Another side of technique is the growing connection between means of transport and a world order of trade and cross-cultural intercourse. Our reader notices that the scientific attitude is not synonymous with the idea of control and planning. For Cassirer, it is rather an attitude of creative searching for knowledge. However, science has its focus on regularity, stability, and intuitive structure. Science goes with the idea of an order of things that can be reconstructed according to a plan. Science takes us back into the wilderness and out on the open dark sea, where men, now well equipped, conquer new territories. Once, when men are taken "out there" - away from any home for humanity and away from the bonds of the past - we can also assess the functions of art, of the cultural sciences, and of philosophy in a new perspective. Cassirer writes on art, that what we feel in art is not a simple or single emotional quality. It is the dynamic process of life itself - the continuous oscillation between opposite poles, be- tween joy and grief, hope and fear, exultation and despair. To give aesthetic form to our passions is to transform them into a free and active state. In the work of the artist the power of passion itself has been made a formative power [...] art turns [...] pains and outrages, these cruelties and atrocities, into a means of self-liberation, thus giving an inner freedom which cannot be attained in any other way.22 So art has a role in respect to the "inner" dimensions of self-liberation. The resolute reader sees this as an issue of authenticity in that the way in which emotions, pas- sions, and feeling are integrated into various forms of experience come to the fore. We get, Cassirer says, quoting Goethe, a "deep" look into the ways of human existence. Accordingly, in a life-world that has more than economy, technique, and science, but also has art and other forms of formative powers, the operations and transformations made by modern man, in relation to a long set of "theoretical skills", are associated all the way through with heartfelt and hard earned lessons of life. What is at stake in cultural development is not only how to transform and extend the action-space of people, but also what change means for people . 22 Cassirer (1992, pp. 148-149). Springer</page><page sequence="18">1 10 Synthese (201 1) 179:93-1 13 Whereas the lessons of life that are brought to the fore by art are significant because they have a meaning across a historically given series of experiences, and thus express more universal features, the lessons provided by the cultural sciences are for the res- olute reader in principle contextually conditioned. The specific task of the cultural sciences is to interpret past events, works, traditions, and institutions as out springs of human life, to interpret them as expressions of life. The resolute reader thinks that an important feature of this kind of cultural interpre- tation is what, in relation to Goethe, has been called the ability of Blick-Lenkung , the ability to see connections and relations between a seemingly disparate set of cultural phenomena in order to grasp a wholeness and historical pattern that would otherwise be "lost in translation".23 The resolute reader notices that the master of this ability is the historian. Cassirer writes, Life in the light of history remains a great realistic drama, with all its tensions and conflicts, its greatness and misery, its hopes and illusions, its display of ener- gies and passions [...] written and read in the right way history elevates us to this atmosphere of freedom amidst all the necessities of our physical, political, social, and economic life.24 The resolute reader underscores that history, as cool science, does indeed point to the conditions and implications of specific historical circumstances, but does so in order to set men free from the prejudices and bonds of previous situations that were not as "polymorphous" as human situations in principle can be: History proceeds in a quite different way [than the natural sciences]. It can live and breathe only in the human world. Like language or art, history is funda- mentally anthropomorphic. To efface its human aspects would be to destroy its specific character and nature. But the anthropomorphism of historical thought is no limitation of or impediment to its objective truth. History is not knowledge of external facts or events; it is a form of self-knowledge [...] in history man constantly returns to himself; he attempts to recollect and actualize the whole of his past experience. But the historical self is not a mere individual self. It is anthropomorphic but it is not egocentric. Stated in the form of a paradox, we may say that history strives after an "objective anthropomorphism". By making us cognizant of the polymorphism of human existence it frees us from the freaks and prejudices of a special and single moment. It is this enrichment and enlarge- ment, not the effacement, of the self, of our knowing and feeling ego, which is the aim of historical knowledge.25 The resolute reader next notices that this praise of the historian leads to a view of his- tory and art as somewhat complementary aspects of culture. Our reader could quote the following: 23 Schieren (1998). 24 Cassirer (1992, p. 206). 25 Cassirer (1992, p. 191). â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Synthese (2011) 179:93-113 111 Art and history are the most powerful instruments of our inquiry into human nature. What would we know of man without these two sources of information? [. . .] We would find only the "average" man, the man of our daily practical and social intercourse. In the great works of history and art we begin to see, behind the mask of the conventional man, the features of the real, individual man.26 Art and (cultural) history then stands as two poles. Where the former generates a proper aesthetic view of things, the latter generates a proper organic view of things, since it "seeks to determine the place of historical knowledge in the organism of human civilization".27 The resolute reader notices three characteristics of Cassirer's view on historical knowledge:28 it sharpens and extends our understanding of the great "tensions" in our human lives, it transcends the understanding of the civilized social person, whom it unmasks, and finally it points to a sphere of freedom, over and above civilization, where man in principle can set himself free from the bonds and limitations of any particular social setting, tradition, or condition. As such, freedom is a matter of learning how tomorrow may be very different from today. Historical knowledge does not bring liberation as such, not even in particular forms, like that of "women's liberation". Such a view wrongly indicates that we have broken with the past - that today is a new day - which is the deluded cry of many ide- ologists and politicians. Historical knowledge instead brings us a more free relation to our own past . We turn towards the future in a freer fashion, but none of the specific elements of horror and oppression of the past, like fascism, witch hunts, taboos, or ritual sacrifices, are dead and gone forever. Such horrors may always return in new and terrifying ways and forms. To deny this would be analogous to what, following Cassirer, we might call a "myth of the state" or simply blindness associated with the societies of modernity, early or late. This then was a survey and summary of the way in which the present states of affairs, with their given normative horizons, are in a sense historically justified. The resolute reader stresses that this kind of assessment of the present is not associated with any principled or schematic conception of progress, evolution, nor a hierarchical development. 11 Why Cassirer is not a voice of the past, but provides a call to the future Consequently, the resolute reader reminds a forthcoming audience about an important aspect of the idea of a philosophy of symbolic forms, seen as an encyclopaedic endeav- our: the aim of such a philosophy is not to bring all the various forms of experience into a common denominator and cast a universal light on them all. On the contrary, the ambition is to sharpen and make clear the profile and special character of the individual forms. So Cassirer's philosophy has the virtue of helping us to stop idle attempts to "fuse" or "unite" the individual forms of experience and expertise. It helps 26 Cassirer (1992, p. 206). 27 Cassirer (1992, p. 206). 28 The explicit distinction between the natural sciences and the cultural sciences is discussed by Cassirer in several texts, even if it is blurred in An Essay on Man. The exact relation between the cultural sciences and Cassirer's cultural philosophy is a final, important issue, see E. W. Orth's paper in this volume. Springer</page><page sequence="20">112 Synthese (2011) 179:93-113 us to block excesses when, for instance, someone thinks that the developments of, say, information technology, brain research, women's sexuality, or international terrorism each mark a decisive moment in our cultural history, in the sense that all or the whole of our human forms of life are shaken. The kinds of crucial, historical developments that Cassirer writes about are not of the kind that would fill the pages of newspapers and best selling magazines. We know this from his careful analysis of the impact of fascism in the book The Myth of the State , which indeed gives us a fine analysis of the historical significance of this twentieth century political phenomenon and disaster. In this respect there is a conservative ring to Cassirer's philosophy, in that it under- scores the long and winding relations and interconnections that have already evolved within our cultural history. Not even the advent of fascism could change this inter- constellation in one fell swoop. Having made this claim, the resolute reader would hurry to add that the philosophy of symbolic forms in another sense points radically to the future. For the problem with the excessive, idle claims concerning cultural rev- olutions is in fact, as Hegel said, that they come too late when the owl of Minerva has flown elsewhere.29 Cassirer's philosophy has learned that Hegelian lesson: this philos- ophy - a true philosophical encyclopaedia - only re-configures and re-interprets the various forms of experience in order to provide a platform for possible forms of re-ori- entation yet to be exercised, if and when they are called for. As such, this philosophy expresses what Goethe called the "culture of knowledge", namely a reassessment of various kinds of experience that not only takes stock of the situation, but also positions itself in the light of an assessment of why it is worth to have experienced what we have.30 The resolute reader addresses Cassirer's forthcoming audience by claiming that what might at first seem like old-fashioned, solemn, and abstract voices of the past could and should be heard as radical voices of the future. The voices of the giants of culture, which Cassirer brings together in order to produce a multilingual echo, were each such "historical voices". They were themselves voices directed towards the future in the light of past experience. They were already rational calls for change and never merely an expression and analysis of what went before. So that is how the resolute reader urges one to read and hear Cassirer himself. References Cassirer, E. (1956). Der Begriff der symbolischen Form im Aufbau der Geisteswissenschaften.
