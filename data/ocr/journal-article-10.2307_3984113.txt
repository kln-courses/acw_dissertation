<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical Trends in Perceptions and Uses of Animals in 20th Century America Stephen R. Kellert * Yale University Most analyses of this country's environmental history presume that Americans are increasingly concerned about animals and nature.' The period since World War II is especially regarded as a period of rapid ex- pansion in animal-related awareness, particularly following "Earth Day" (1970).2 Do we presume too much? Is this age truly distinctive in its degree of environmental and animal-related awareness? Do the legislative changes since World War II reflect substantive shifts in the average person's percep- tions of animals? The passage of laws is often more representative of the ability of special interest groups to influence policy than the actual con- cerns of the general public. It should be emphasized that this study does not dispute the radical changes which have occurred in animal-related uses and perceptions in America prior to the 20th century, particularly from 1860-1900.3 A cur- sory description of this period indicates a profound shift in practical dependencies on animals, as well as a remarkably destructive exploitation of wildlife leading to the development of an American conservation move- ment and an associated governmental regulatory structure.4 What is uncer- tain is the nature and extent of changes which have occurred in animal use and perception since 1900.1 Methodology Two methodological challenges confronted this research: the need to identify a source of data that adequately reflected the views and behaviors of average 20th century Americans, and the development of procedures * Many thanks to Miriam Westervelt who co-authored the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, General Printing Office report (#024-010-00-641-2) of the historical trends study.</page><page sequence="2">to measure these changes in an empirical and standardized fashion. An analogous study by Bos et al.6 suggested that the content of newspaper articles might be a reasonably good indicator of public perceptions and uses of animals. Newspapers are generally oriented to local constituen- cies and thus can be relatively good indicators of generally held views and interests. If judiciously selected, newspapers can reflect urban, rural, and regional attitudes. By selecting newspapers in continuous publication, historical changes can be assessed in a manner relatively undistorted by interpretive recall. The Ayers Directory of Publications,1 American Newspaper Market's Circulation,I and Newspapers in Microform U.S.' were employed to iden- tify 20 newspapers as candidates for the study. Four newspapers were even- tually selected for the analysis representing two rural, two urban, and four regional locations. The two urban newspapers were the Los Angeles Times and Hartford Courant, while the two rural newspapers included the Buf- falo Bulletin (Buffalo, WY), the Rocky Mountain newspaper, and the Dawson News (Dawson, GA), representing the South. The considerable time required to analyze the content of newspaper articles necessitated a random sampling of issues. Every third year start- ing with 1900 was selected, although during critical historical periods every other year was chosen (the two year interval periods included the Theodore Roosevelt era from 1900-1906, World War I, the Depression, and World War II). A total of 31 years were involved in the analysis. Seventeen to 18 newspaper issues were selected for each single year, yielding approx- imately 550 issues for each newspaper. Using the World Almanac's'? perpetual calendar, 32 starting dates were randomly identified, with issues chosen each successive third week. Time constraints necessitated a smaller sampling of the Hartford Courant. Specific issue selection for this newspaper was based on the Los Angeles Times sample, with the date of every third Los Angeles Times issue used as the basis for choosing the Hartford Courant sample, resulting in 86 Hartford Courant issues. The second methodological challenge was the development of a stan- dardized procedure for recording and analyzing the content of the animal related newspaper articles. The final format recorded 17 kinds of infor- mation. Basic descriptive data included: the newspaper in which the arti- cle occurred, the issue date, the location of the article in the issue, its relative importance, the geographic scope of the article, and the type of article (e.g., general news, column, etc.). Information on specific animals covered: the taxonomic identity of the animals; the relationship of the animals to human beings (e.g., pet, livestock, etc.); if the animal was wild, its population status (e.g., endangered, rare, etc.) and the geographic loca- tion of the animals (e.g., region of the U.S. country). Detailed informa- tion on 31 animal-related activities was also recorded including hunting, fishing, trapping, animal-related art, birdwatching, animal-related food gathering, nonconsumptive wildlife use, animal-inflicted damage, animal ecology, animal welfare, pet ownership, wildlife management, and a number of other activities. The final information category focused on perceptions of animals. A typology of 10 basic attitudes toward animals was employed in this analysis, derived from a previously developed system."I One-sentence definitions of each attitude are indicated in Table 1, although more lengthy 20</page><page sequence="3">descriptions are available elsewhere. '2 The strength or intensity of the at- titudes was measured on a 1 to 10 scale, with 1 indicating the attitude as strongly present, and 10 reflecting the attitude as only slightly present. At least one attitude was coded for each article, although this attitude was not necessarily recorded as strongly present. Conversely, it was not Table 1: Attitudes Toward Animals - Definitions Aesthetic - Primary interest in the artistic and symbolic characteristics of animals. Dominionistic - Primary interest in the mastery and control of animals, typically in sporting situations. Ecologistic - Primary concern for the environment as a system, for in- terrelationships between wildlife species and natural habitats. Humanistic - Primary interest and strong affection for individual animals, principally pets; regarding wildlife, primary focus on large animals with common anthropomorphic associations. Moralistic - Primary concern for the right and wrong treatment of animals, with strong opposition to exploitation or cruelty toward animals. Naturalistic - Primary interest and affection for wildlife and the outdoors. Negativistic - Primary orientation a dislike or fear of animals. Neutralistic - Primary orientation a neutral relation to and emotional detachment from animals. Scientistic - Primary interest in the physical attributes and biological func- tioning of animals. Utilitarian - Primary concern for the practical and material value of animals or the animal's habitat. uncommon for more than one attitude to be found in an article, or for more than one attitude to receive "strongly present" codes. Five persons were trained to record the content of the articles. Each coder analyzed a minimum of 50 pretest articles before working on the sample issues. A large sample size, careful coder training, and the employment of a small number of coders hopefully minimized the unavoidable subjectivity of con- tent analysis. RESULTS A total of 4,873 animal-related articles were analyzed during the 75-year period. An average of 157 articles occurred per year, or 2.74 per issue. No major increase was found in the number of animal-related ar- ticles during the century (Fig. 1). The greatest number of articles in a single year was 275 in 1964, although more than 200 articles were also en- countered during 1921, 1927, 1930, and 1967 (Table 2). When the 75 years were distinguished by historical period, an average of 200 or more articles per year occurred from 1921-1927, 1930-1936, and 1961-1967. The lowest average number of articles - less than 114 per year - were found during 21</page><page sequence="4">the two World War periods, 1916-1918 and 1940-1944. The periods with the greatest number of animal-related articles have been identified by Rose'3 as times of major conservation interest during the twentieth century. According to this and other analyses, a marked in- crease in wildlife and nature-related interest in the 1920s was partly attri- F IGURE 1 FREQUENCY OF ANIMAL-RELATED NEWSPAPER ARTICLES 1900-1976 6 5 z w 4 CY ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ YA w LL 3 z W 2 0 cr w a- 0 L --A I I 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 YEAR butable to the influence of the automobile. '4 National parks and wilderness areas became, for the first time, readily accessible to tourists, campers, and sportsmen, and an unprecedented demand resulted for recreational contact with wildlife.'5 An increase in animal-related interest during the 1930s may have been related to the impacts of unwise resource use and depletion associated with the depression, and Federal government attempts at wildlife and public land management.'6 The 1960s witnessed the emergence of broad public environmental concerns, marked by the plans for "Earth Day" as the decade drew to a close.'7 In contrast, the two periods of least animal interest - the two World Wars - may have reflected a shift in the country's attention away from domestic concerns to the imperatives of conflict. The various newspaper articles were also distinguished according to broad stylistic categories. The gene4s , iews article was by far the most frequently encountered, accounting for 63% of all animal-related articles. This type of article decreased significantly, however, from 79% of the total in 1900-1915 to 55% during 196141976. Pictorial stories were second in overall occurrence, increasing dramatically from 3% of the total at the beginning of the century to 19% since 1960. Hunting and fishing columns 22</page><page sequence="5">also increased markedly from not being found in any newspaper from 1900-1915 to comprising 4% of the articles during 1961-1976. Feature stories involving animals accounted for approximately 11 070.

The utilitarian attitude was by far the most prevalent perception of animals, especially during war periods. Despite this domi- nant position during the entire 75 year period, the relative frequency of the utilitarian attitude declined substantially in recent decades (Figure 3). In the 1970-1976 period, for example, the utilitarian attitude occurred 12% more often than did the neutralistic perspective (the second most frequent); in contrast in 1900-1906, the utilitarian attitude was 36%o more common than the second most frequent attitude, the humanistic. This decrease was especially pronounced in the Los Angeles Times, where the utilitarian perspective declined from more than 50%o during World War I to 30/o after 1970. In contrast, in the rural newspapers, the utilitarian attitude decreased only slightly and, in the Dawson News from 1970-1976, this attitude occurred in nearly two-thirds of this newspaper's articles. The humanistic attitude was second in overall frequency of occur- rence during the century. This perspective was found in 16%o of the ar- ticles, although its relative rank dropped from second in 1900-1906 to fourth by 1961-1976. The humanistic attitude occurred most often dur- ing World War II, when 26%o of the articles included this perspective. This attitude increased significantly in the Los Angeles Times, particularly after World War II. In contrast, in the rural newspapers, this attitude decreased 23</page><page sequence="6">substantially and, by 1961-1976, just 30/0 of the rural newspaper articles included this perspective.

In the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, a substantial decrease in the utilitarian perspective was cor- related with a major increase in the humanistic attitude. An analogous urban/rural difference was reported in a 1978 national study of 3,107 Americans. '8 The neutralistic attitude ranked third in overall frequency, steadily increasing during the century and ranking second by 1970-1976 (Fig. 4). This increase was especially pronounced in the rural newspapers. In the Buffalo Bulletin, for example, this attitude occurred in just 6% of the articles prior to 1930, but in 40%0 after 1960. In contrast, the neutralistic attitude appeared in 18%o of Los Angeles Times articles from 1946-1960, and 80/o since 1960. 24</page><page sequence="7">FREQUENCY OF TEN ATTITUDES TOWARD ANIMALS 1900-1976 FIGURE 2 0 Utitar o Humanistic * Negativistic 7 0 c Scientistic A Neutralistic a A Dominionistic * Aesthetic 6 0 / ;O0 Ecologistic 0 Moralistic v Naturalistic 50e C: D 40 :340 Li c a- @ 30_ 20 - 10 A 0 1900-1906 1909-1915 1916-1918 1921-1927 1930-1938 1940-1944 1946-1958 1961-1967 1970-1976 Historical Periods FREQUENCY OF UTILITARIAN ATTITUDE, 1900-1976 70 60 ~50- w w 40 I1 30 w 20 w a- I 0 0 1900- 1909- 1916- 1921- 1930- 1940- 1946- 1961- 1970- 1906 1915 1918 1927 1938 1944 1958 1967 1976 HISTORICAL PERIODS 25</page><page sequence="8">FREQUENCY OF NEUTRALISTIC ATTITUDE, 1900-1976 30 FIGURE 4 z I w 20h w U- z 1900- 909 1916- 1921- 1930- 1940- 1946- 1961- 1970- 1906 i915 1918 1927 1938 1944 1958 1967 1976 HISTORICAL PERIODS The negativistic attitude decreased markedly during the century, although this perspective ranked fourth overall, and occurred in 11% I of the articles (Fig. 5). Reflecting this decline, the negativistic attitude was found in 14%7o of the articles from 1900-1946, but in 7% after World War II. This decrease was particularly dramatic in the rural newspapers, but far less evident in the Los Angeles Times. The relative occurrence of the utilitarian, humanistic, negativistic and neutralistic attitudes was similar to results reported in the 1978 study of American attitudes toward wildlife.19 Percentage differences, however, were substantially larger. The aesthetic attitude was fifth in relative frequency of occurrence, and found in less than 1Oo of the articles. This attitude increased slightly during the century although, in recent decades, it was most often en- countered in the urban newspapers. This latter result further suggested that an appreciative and less pragmatic perspective of animals was more characteristic of the urban than rural newspapers, especially in more con- temporary times. The dominionistic attitude was present in 8%o of the articles, ranking 6th in relative frequency. This attitude occurred most often in the Los Angeles Times, particularly after 1960. The ecologistic attitude was found in 7% of the articles and ranked seventh overall. This attitude increased significantly and, by 1970-1976, ranked fourth in relative frequency of occurrence, appearing in 13%o of the articles. This increase was especially evident in the Los Angeles Times where, prior to 1960, this attitude was found in 6%Mo of the articles, but 18%7o after 1960 (Fig. 6). In the rural newspapers, the ecologistic attitude increased only slightly. 26</page><page sequence="9">FREQUENCY OF NEGATIVISTIC ATTITUDE, 1900-1976 30 FI GURE 5 z U D 20 a CS S = ..... ...

HISTORICAL PER~~~~~~......IODS... The scientistic attitude was the eighth most frequent attitude, en- countered in 70/o of the articles. Additionally, this perspective decreased substantially during the century. Newspaper differences were insignificant in recent times although, prior to 1940, the scientistic attitude occurred most often in the rural newspapers. The naturalistic attitude was rarely encountered throughout the cen- tury. This attitude was most prevalent in the Los Angeles Times in recent years, although still found in only 8% of this newspaper's articles after 1960. The moralistic was the least frequently occurring attitude, present in 3% of the articles. This result was somewhat surprising as the moralistic perspective was among the four most prevalent attitudes in the 1978 na- tional study. This difference may reflect the varying methodologies employed in the two studies. It may also suggest the limited importance of animal cruelty and rights considerations as newsworthy events. The rari- ty of the moralistic attitude was particularly evident in the rural newspapers, with this perspective being almost nonexistent after World War II. In contrast, in the Los Angeles Times, the moralistic attitude was found in 80o of the articles after 1940. Types of Activities and Animals The frequency of animal-related activities and types of animals was also examined. Farming and livestock production were the most common activities during the century, found in 25% of the articles. This theme decreased significantly, however, comprising 15% of the activity classifica- tions after 1960 (Table 4). Relatedly, the frequency of the domestic livestock animal category declined from 41% of all classifications prior 27</page><page sequence="10">to 1946 to 25% after 1960 (Table 5). During World War 1, livestock ac- counted for a remarkable 63 % of all animal citations. These shifts were especially pronounced in the Los Angeles Times, where farming declined from 13 Wo of activity classifications during 1900-1915 to 5% after 1960. In contrast, in the Buffalo, Wyoming newspaper, this decline was only slightly evident and, in the Georgia newspaper, farming classifications actually increased from 33 to 42% of the total.

From 1946-1960, however, game animals increased to 25% of animal classifications and, in 1961-1976, occurred in 39%o of the articles (displacing livestock as the most frequent animal category). The proportion of hunting-related articles also increas- ed substantially, comprising 12% of the activity classifications from 1946 to 1960, and 17%7o after 1960.

General descriptive articles concerning animals comprised 5% of the total, increasing from 2% prior to 1960 to 11I % after 1960. The occurrence of specific animals was also examined. The most fre- quently encountered animals were the dog, horse, and cow (Table 6). The deer was the most popular wild animal, eighth in overall occurrence. Pets, livestock, and game animals consisted of the 10 most frequently occurr- ing animals. Among vertebrate classes, mammals accounted for two-thirds of the animal citations; birds, 14%; fish, 8%; and reptiles and amphi- bians, 3%. Invertebrates comprised 9% of the animal classifications. Geographic Scope and Endangered Species The majority of animal-related articles focused on local issues and animals native to the United States, with this parochial tendency increas- ing during the century. Approximately 75% of the articles emphasized local matters, 8% were regionally-oriented, 137o had a national focus, and 4%1o stressed international issues. This local emphasis increased from 550%o of the articles in 1900-1915 to 88%7o after 1960. Articles of national scope, on the other hand, decreased from 20% to 6% during the same period. This trend was particularly evident in the rural newspapers. In the Buffalo, Wyoming newspaper, for example, locally-oriented articles increased from 28%Mo in 1900-1915 to a remarkable 99.8% after 1960. The proportion of local articles in the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, increased only slightly from 69% to 73% during the same period.

Articles on rare, endangered, or extinct species were infrequently encountered, appearing in just 2070 of the articles. The greatest proportion of articles concerning imperiled species were found during the initial and latter parts of the century. Conclusion The results of this research cast serious doubt on the presumption that a major increase has occurred in the amount of animal-related awareness and interest in American society. What appears to have transpired, instead, is a substantial shift in the nature rather than volume of American perceptions and behaviors toward animals, particularly wildlife. Three periods of pronounced concern for animals and the natural environment were encountered during the 1920s, '30s, and '60s. These periods also corresponded with eras identified by others as major epochs of conservation-mindedness in the United States. The 1920s has been described as a time when American recreational interest in wildlife and nature was profoundly affected by the advance of the automobile, render- ing natural areas readily accessible to the general public.20 The 1930s, on the other hand, witnessed a major expansion in public concern for the damaging effects of exploitation of natural resources related to the economic hardships of the depression.2" The 1960s was marked by the emergence of a large public constituency concerned with expanded non- consumptive enjoyment of and desire to protect the natural environment.22 Major changes in the character of American perceptions of animals were also reflected in significant shifts in the occurrence of utilitarian, negativistic, neutralistic, and ecologistic attitudes. These changes suggested a pronounced decline in exploitative and fearful attitudes toward animals, and a corresponding increase in appreciative and emotionally neutral perceptions of nonhuman species. These views were geographically variable, however, with a less pragmatic, more aesthetic and emotionally positive attitude toward animals occurring in the urban areas. The rural areas were characterized, instead, by a strong and stable utilitarian and emotionally detached and less anthropomorphic and protectionist attitude toward animals. A major increase in animal-related recreational and entertainment activities was also observed. Conversely, a major decline was found in farming and livestock activities, particularly in the urban areas. These ac- tivity trends collectively suggested a growing interest in animals as sources of pleasure and leisure distraction rather than material gain or practical advantage. On the other hand, the continuing dominance of the utilitarian perspective suggested this shift toward a "nonconsumptive" and less pragmatic relationship to animals should not be unduly emphasized. Americans have apparently remained a highly pragmatic and commodity- oriented people in relation to animals and the natural world. While shifts away from this predominant value orientation have occurred, the utilitarian perspective continues to be a major force in American perceptions of animals. 31</page><page sequence="14">Refinement of the research methods and a broadening of the data base will be required before a clear picture emerges of American attitudes toward and uses of animals during the 20th century. Historical studies are necessarily fraught with uncertainty when novel, empirically-oriented, and interdisciplinary research is attempted. Nevertheless, this exploratory study should provide some insights regarding human relationships to animals in American history. E?z ENDNOTES 1.
