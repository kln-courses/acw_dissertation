<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FORMATION OF A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE. From very early times thinkers have felt the diversity of languages in the different parts of the world to be a great dis advantage and handicap to the progress of the human race. So have arisen the legends of the "golden age" when all men, and even the animals, had a common speech, and of the loss of this blessing following the loss of innocence. Although we do not, perhaps, to-day think that if we could give to all nations a common tongue the world would return to a state of primeval blessedness, there are nevertheless many persons in many lands who feel that such a gift would be an inestimable boon to mankind. That this is the case is evident from the widespread welcome which has of late years been accorded to such notable attempts in this direction as Volapuk, La Langue Bleue of M. Bollack, Espe ranto, and its successor Ido. These, despite their simplicity of construction and many other excellent points, either have failed, or probably will fail, to achieve what their inventors hoped for them. And the cause of such failure should most likely be looked for in the fact that their originators have not gone to the root of the matter. A knowledge of Esperanto or Ido, for instance, is doubtless easily acquired by a European, especially if he has a slight knowl</page><page sequence="2">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 3d edge of Latin and a couple of other European languages besides his own ; but it cannot be particularly easy for a Chinaman, a Jap anese or a South Sea Islander, owing to the fact that its vocabulary is based upon those of Europe. Knowing that the inventors of these languages and many other scholars, all far more learned and with far greater opportunities for studying the matter than will ever be his, have given much time and thought to this question, it is naturally with great diffidence that the present writer asks the attention of the public to the scheme which follows, in which, it seems to him, lies the germ of a language framed on scientific principles, a language as easily acquired by the Tartar and the Fijian as by the Englishman and the Italian, a language whose relationship to thought will be analogous to that of phonetic shorthand to speech. Man as a maker of language must in the beginning have been in the disadvantageous position of not being able to discuss the best way to set about it until he could manage to make himself under stood somehow. And by that time the mischief was done. Now let us for a moment indulge in the extravagant supposi tion that man in the beginning, though rational and intelligent as now, was dumb. Let us further imagine that he had perfected a code of dumb-show signals by which he could communicate to his fellows every idea which occurred to him. Then let us suppose that all of a sudden the gods?seized by one of these whims which must have made them so difficult to get on with in those times?sent down a messenger with the gift of articulate speech. What would the humans have done? Doubtless, being intelligent as we said, they would have called a solemn assembly of the whole race to decide what was the best use to make of the new possession. They would at once have perceived that sounds would make a much more convenient medium for the expression of thought than sign making, if once they should agree as to what idea each sound should express. They would first of all carefully try how many distinct and different sounds they could produce. The result of this inquiry would show that there were about sixteen consonant sounds which most of them could enunciate clearly?though cer tain individuals here and there found some difficulty with two or three of them?and about ten clearly defined vowel sounds. They would then consider whether with this small number of sounds it was possible to express the manifold ideas which from time to time they would need to communicate to each other.</page><page sequence="3">302 THE MONIST. After what would probably be a somewhat lengthy and very animated discussion, the chairman would call upon a noted sign maker to sum up the result of their deliberations. This gentleman would then address his spectators in their sign language, showing that, as far as he could gather it, the general sense of the meeting was that, with strict economy of the material to be worked on, it would be possible to use speech as a medium for the exchange of ideas; that it was the intention of the conference to appoint a committee to draw up a scheme for this purpose ; that before elect ing the members of that committee and deciding on the date of their next meeting at which the said scheme should be submit ted for common approval, it would be as well to summarize broadly the lines on which they wished their committee to work. The chief points to which they would direct the attention of the com mitteemen were: 1. That to each sound should be allotted a general idea, par ticular ideas being expressed by the combination of these sounds into words or syllables. 2. That in so far as it was possible to avoid doing so, two dif ferent ideas should not be expressed by the same concatenation of sounds. 3. That the grammatical construction of the language should be as simple as it could be made, the necessary rules once decided on being applied consistently and without exceptions. 4. That if it were found possible to give adequate expression to all ideas without making use of such sounds as offered dif ficulty to this or that portion of the human race, it should be done ; that if not, they should be used as sparingly as possible. We can imagine that the meeting would then break up after having elected the committee and passed a resolution pointing out the evil results which might follow if any one tried to express him self in speech before the date of the next meeting and the final adoption of a scheme. We can also imagine that at the next "general meeting" of the human race, the signalman of the committee, in the few remarks with which he would introduce the report, would state that, while his fellow committeemen and himself felt that they had succeeded in carrying out the wishes of their electors with regard to recom mendations Nos. 1 and 3, they had not been quite so successful in the cases of Nos. 2 and 4. With regard to No. 2 : Owing to the fact that ideas were many</page><page sequence="4">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. and consonants few they had found it necessary to allot to each of this class of sound two meanings, and even to use some of them in a third sense in forming inflexions, and it thus sometimes happened that the same group of sounds did represent two ideas. Thus it-ar would be found to stand for "was dark" and i-tar for "to darken," and it to mean "was" and also "cold," but that he did not feel that any confusion was likely to result from this. With regard to recommendation No. 4: The committee, owing to this same paucity of consonants, had felt constrained to make use of certain sounds which he feared a large number of his fellow men had a difficulty in enunciating. These were notably r, s and th. But he would like to point out to his Chinese, Polynesian and French friends that even if these sounds were a little bit hard to say, they were at least quite easy to write, and that communication with distant peoples would largely be written. And here, in a few well-chosen contortions and grimaces, he would explain the method and intention of the art of writing, which he and his fellow com mitteemen would doubtless have invented and included as an ap pendix in their report. Having, he hoped, not unduly trespassed on his spectators' time, he now had great pleasure in submitting to them the result of the committee's deliberations in the form of a rational language to which they had provisionally given the name of Tel (pronounced like "tail") and meaning, as they would shortly be in a position to see for themselves, "The Easily Understood." And the great scheme itself might very well have been in substance that which follows. Convention I. Every idea which occurs to us comes through the medium of one of the five senses ; and by a happy coincidence five happens to be the number of the clearly differentiated vowel sounds in com mon use among mankind. Here then we have the basis of the first convention of our rational language. Let each vowel connote one of the five senses. It does not matter much which vowel stands for which sense, so long as we are all agreed. So we will allot them as follows : a to seeing, e to hearing, i to touch, 0 to taste, u to smell. Our first lesson then, is that whenever the vowel a occurs in a syllable its meaning has something to do with seeing ; whenever e occurs the meaning of the syllable has something to do with hear ing, and so on of the other three vowels.</page><page sequence="5">304 THE MONIST. Convention II. Ideas being many and the sounds which we are capable of utter ing but few, we shall have to give each of the consonants two values according to its position in the syllable. This brings us to the second convention: Every word beginning with a consonant other than is a noun, and each consonant standing at the beginning of a word shall have a definite meaning. Here again the allotting of the mean ings is arbitrary, but not without considerable thought the following table has been drawn up : Each word beginning with b is the name of a beast, tt tt tt tt V f 9 r I " " m " " k " " s " " _ tt a d " " t " " sh " " th " " ? &lt;i n tt a tt bird, fish or reptile, invertebrate animal, solid, mineral, etc. liquid, gas, vapor, human being, plant, limb, member, part, manufactured article, thing, abstraction, shape, space, " " time, weather. tt tt tt a a a a tt a a a a a tt tt tt tt tt Convention III. The consonants when they occur in the middle or at the end of a word shall have the values given in the table below. These values are adjectival or adverbial as the sense requires. Their meaning also varies slightly according to the vowel with which they are combined. Thus b has the general meaning of "good," "well," and so when combined with the vowel a means "good to see," i. e., "beauti ful." When combined with the vowel e, it means "good to hear," i. e., "musical." When combined with i it means "good to feel," i. e., "pleasant." When combined with o it means "good to taste," and when with u "good to smell," i. e., "sweet-scented."</page><page sequence="6">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS.

For instance let us take the word bag. This begins with b and is therefore the name of an animal of mammalian order ; its vowel</page><page sequence="7">3o6 THE MONIST. is a which means "appears"; g is the adjective "great." Bag is, then, "the animal which looks big." This may be the elephant. It may be objected that it may just as well be the hippopotamus. That is so ; but we shall be able presently to add a second syllable which will define it more clearly. Beg, a reference to the tables will show to be "the loud-voiced animal"; big, "the heavy animal"; bog is "the strongly-flavored animal," and bug "the strongly-smelling animal"?obviously the skunk or the polecat. At this stage the student will find it an interesting and useful exercise to take any two consonants and put the five vowels in turn between them, and then write down the meaning of the resulting word. In doing so, he must bear in mind that bag is the animal which appears great, not the animal which sees greatly, i. e., the keen-sighted animal ; that beg is the animal which is heard greatly, not the animal with a keen sense of hearing. We shall come to these others by and by. We may also form a large number of simple adjectives. These begin with a vowel and consist of two letters only. From k which means "bad," we get ak, "ugly"; ek, "unmusical"; ik, "unpleasant to the touch" ; ok, "nasty" ; uk, "foul-smelling." The verb "to be" is expressed by the letter i, and this vowel as a prefix is the characteristic of all other verbs. By placing it before each of the vowels we get the five verbs: ia, "to see"; ie, "to hear" ; it, "to feel" ; io, "to taste" ; iu, "to smell." From each of these are formed two other verbs with the aid of each of the consonants. In the case where the consonant pre cedes the sense vowel the latter has an active meaning, and where the consonant follows the sense vowel it has a passive meaning. A few examples will make this clear: Iga is "to see greatly," i. e., "to gaze" ; tag is "to appear great," i. e., "to loom." Ige is "to have a keen sense of hearing," ieg "to sound loud." Igi is "to have a keen sense of touch," tig "to feel big, i. e., "to be heavy, to weigh." Igo is "to have a keen sense of taste," tog "to be strong-flavored." Igu is "to have a keen sense of smell," iug "to be strong-scented." Having got so far, we are enabled to form a new series of nouns by placing consonants before the verbs of the iga type, e. g. : Miga, "the gazer" ; biga, "the far-sighted animal, the greyhound" ; viga, "the hawk" ; sigi, "the organ which has a keen sense of touch, the finger" ; bigu, "the hound."</page><page sequence="8">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. Convention V. Adverbs are formed by the addition of the letter u to adjectives. Thus ab, "beautiful," gives abu, "beautifully"; af, "small," gives afu, "little, slightly"; av, "high," gives avu, "up, upwards." Convention VI. The preposition "of" is expressed by the word 0, and this preposition is used very freely to express obvious relationships, much as it was in old English where it was possible to say, "He was killed of a stone," "They were found of their enemies," "He did it of a Monday morning." By the addition of 0 to adjectives?and in a few cases to other parts of speech as well?prepositions may be formed from them. As these are not quite so obvious in mean ing as the words we have up till now considered, a list of the commoner ones is appended. We have not so far dealt with the combination of two con sonants, but it will be as well to say here that s, which has move ment for its primary meaning, is incorporated in prepositions to give the idea of motion. So from many adjectives we get two useful prepositions of kindred meaning, the one implying rest, the other motion to or from. From ab, "agreeable," we get abo, "in accordance with." From ak, "hostile," we get ako, "against," and akso, "against" (motion). From ad, "fixed," we get ado, "at," and adso, "to, towards." From af, "small," we get afo, "near," and afso, "near." From ag, "great," we get ago, "far from," and agso, "from." From an, "low," we get ano, "under," and anso, "down, under." From ap, "light," we get apo, "outside," and apso, "out of." From ar, "dark," we get aro, "in," and arso, "into." From av, "high," we get avo, "upon," and avso, "up." Inflections. Inflections are, of course, reduced to the smallest number pos sible. The noun is inflected for number only, the plural being formed by the addition of y to the singular, e. g. : beg, "dog," begy, "dogs" ; sigi, "finger," sigiy, "fingers" ; bagrag, "whale," bagragy, "whales." It is true that from the word bigu, which signifies "dog" gen erally, we can'form the words biguatn, "a male dog," and bigual,</page><page sequence="9">3 8 THE MONIST. "a female dog," but these are compound words rather than inflec tions in the grammatical sense of the word. Case is expressed as in English by the position of the word in the sentence, and not by inflection as in Latin. The nominative precedes the verb, the objective follows it, or comes after a prepo sition. Maf imi bigu means "The child holds the dog." Bigu imi maf means "The dog holds the child." Zer o mamaf i at means "The boy's drum is blue." The adjective is not inflected either for gender, number, case or degree of comparison. The comparative and superlative are ex pressed, as in the case of the longer adjectives in English, by put ting words equivalent to "more" and "most" before the simple form of the adjective. The verb is inflected for tense, mood, and voice, but not for person and number. The last two are quite unnecessary when, as in most modern languages, the pronoun is expressed, and in T?l they are accordingly not found. The verbal inflections are added immediately to the verbal sign i, and precede the letters which contain the meaning of the verb. The future is shown by the presence of the letter r: ipi, "to pierce; fut., me irpi, "I shall pierce." A t is the sign of the past tense : me itpi, "I pierced," "I have pierced," or "I did pierce." By combining these two we get the future perfect tense: me irtpi, "I shall have pierced." Should any difficulty be experienced in pronouncing the com bination thus formed?or indeed at any time in the language Tel? an atonic e is inserted, e. g., me irteba, "I shall have smiled." This e is scarcely sounded at all ju^i. as in our "the" when said quickly in the middle of a sentence. In writing, this e may be omitted altogether, as was always done in the old Egyptian and kindred languages ; but it is a good plan for a beginner to put it in, using for the purpose a different form of the letter?say the Greek e? to distinguish it from the letter which indicates the idea of "hear ing." Throughout the remainder of this article a small superior e is used to denote this atonic vowel. The pluperfect is formed by doubling the t which signifies the past, inserting the atonic e to enable the double sound of the t to be heard: me itftpi, "I had pierced."</page><page sequence="10">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 3O9 L is the sign of the conditional mood: Me ilpi, "I should pierce" ; me iltpi, "I should have pierced." The infinitive does not differ in form from the indicative: Mar itga ieb, "The negro wished to sing." Mamaf ilga itmi vat, "The boy would like to have caught the blue bird." Zip imta irpi zil, "The needle was seen to be about to pierce the cushion." The word imta in the last example belongs to the passive voice. This is shown by putting the letter m immediately after the verbal sign i, before the letters indicating mood and tense: Me ipif " I pierce" ; Me impi, "I am pierced." Me itetpi, "I had pierced"; Me im*tetpi, "I had been pierced." The full conjugation of the verb imi, "to hold" or "have," is as follows: ACTIVE. Pres. Me imi, I hold Fut. Me irmi, I shall hold Past. Me itmi, I held, I have held Fut-pf. Me irtmi, I shall have held Plupf. Me itetmi, I had held Condit. Me ilmi, I should hold .. Past. Me iltmi, I should have held Inf. pres. imi, to hold .. Fut. irmi, to be about to hold .. Past, itmi, to have held PASSIVE. Me imemi, I am held Me imermi, I shall be held Me imetmi, I was held, I have been held. Me imertmi, I shall have been held Me imtetmi, I had been held Me imelmi, Ishould be held Me imrttmi, I should have been held imemi, to be held imermi, to be about to be held imetmi, to have been held There is in Tel no distinction between nouns and pronouns, the latter being expressed by the use of certain nouns. "I" is me, the person heard, the speaker. "Thou" is ma, the person seen. For the pronoun of the third peison whether "he" or "she," the word me is used which is really simply "the person." If the speaker wishes to emphasize the sex, however, he will use mam for "he," and mal for "she." In the case of animals be, ve, pe or je will be employed instead of me, according to the class of animal referred to ; whilst "it" is de, i. e., "thing." In all cases the plural is formed as in other nouns by adding y to the singular. Of course the remarkable custom so prevalent</page><page sequence="11">THE MONIST. in modern languages, of saying "you" when we mean "thou" will have no place in Tel, and "you" must always be translated by ma when one person only is addressed. The objective case is of the same form as the nominative, and the possessive is expressed by means of the preposition o : Mal iWago me d-imrar o ma, "She gave me your letter." The demonstrative pronouns "this" and "that" are respectively dafo and dago, that is to say, d, "thing" compounded with ajo, "near" and ago, "far." The corresponding majo and mago, re ferring to persons, are our "the latter" and " the former." Majo (plural, ma joy) is also used for all the reflexive pronouns which refer to persons, e. g. : Me irshi majo, "I shall cut myself" ; Mamajy itefki majoy, "The boys had hurt themselves." Dajo, dajoy are the corresponding "itself, themselves." We now come to a very important feature of T?l. This is the use of the "long" vowels. And here it will be as well to say a word as to pronunciation. As Tel is intended for use as a uni versal language, it will be best to give to the vowels what are to-day their most widely accepted values, and not those which are peculiar to the English tongue. The following are therefore suggested as the best values to give them: a has the sound of a in "father," ? that of a in "all." e has the sound of e in "pen," ? that of ai in "pain." i has the sound of i in "pin," I that of i in "machine." o has the sound of o in "not," that of o in "note." u has the sound of u in "put," ? that of oo in "boot." The long vowels are used to signify the same sense as the cor responding short ones, but with the meaning transferred to the mental plane. Thus, long a means "appearing to the mind's eye" and "seeing with the mind's eye." Long e means "heard by the mind's ear," "learned" ; and "hear ing with the mind," "apprehending," "understanding." Long i means "felt by the mind," and "touching with the mind." Long o means "savoring of," etc., and "tasting with the mind." Long u means "having the scent of to the mind," i. e., "suggest ing"; also "suspecting," "guessing" etc. A few examples will show what a wide range of ideas may now be expressed. Whereas tab is "to be well-looking"; i. e., "to flourish," "to</page><page sequence="12">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 3" be in health" ; iab is "to be well-seeming to the mind" ; i. e., "to be favorably received," "to be granted," "accepted." Iba is "to look kindly," "to smile" ; ib? is "to look kindly on with the mind," "to receive favorably," "to accept." Iak is "to be ugly," "unbecoming," "in bad condition"; i?k is "to seem ugly to the mind," "to be unacceptable," "to displease." Ika is "to look foully on," "to scowl; ik? is "to view hostilely with the mind," i. e., "to refuse," "to reject." Ab is "beautiful to look at"; ab is "beautiful to the mind," "pleasant." lef is "to emit a faint sound" ; i?j is "to be dimly understood." I je is "to hear faintly"; ij? is "to understand but slightly." Im is "hard"; ?m, "difficult." Imi is "to touch masterfully," i. e., "to grasp," "hold," "have" ; imi, "to comprehend," "to know." Ok is "nasty to eat"; ?k, "revolting" (to the mind). Ug is "strong-smelling"; ?g, "reminding strongly" (of). So far we have considered the building of words which comprise not more than three ideas, and these we have found to consist of one, or at most two, syllables. These root words are, however, capable of being combined in a great variety of ways, giving new words of more precise meaning. In making these compound words it must be borne in mind that the qualifying syllable or letter always follows, never precedes, that which it qualifies. The qualifying syllable may be originally a noun, an adjective, a verb, or even sometimes a preposition or an adverb. The word bag is "the animal which looks great," and so may stand for any big beast. By adding as a second syllable rag which is "the great water," i. e., "the sea," we get bagrag, "the whale." If instead of rag we add ris, "the moving water," i. e., "river," we get bagris, "hippopotamus." Baged is "the big beast with the deep voice," "elephant." Whilst bagsiusip, "big beast nose horn" is "rhinoceros." Berob, "the grunting animal, good to eat," gives us the "pig." Then from this or any noun we may get a new series of adjectives, e. g. : A-berob, "looking like a pig." (It will be as well, by the way, during the earlier stages of our acquaintance with Tel to separate the elements of the word by hyphens [a-ber-ob], or we may be misled into reading the first two letters as ab, "beautiful"). E-ber ob is "sounding like a pig," i-ber-ob "feeling like a pig," o-ber-ob</page><page sequence="13">312 THE MONIST. "tasting like pork," u-ber-ob "smelling like a pig." From each of these adjectives, again, the corresponding abstract noun can be formed by prefixing t : ta-ber-ob, "piggishness" ; to-ber-ob, "a pork like flavor." From any noun a verb may be made by the simple expedient of putting the verbal prefix in front of it. Thus from rar, "ink," we have i-rar, "to write." (Conjugation: ir*-rar, it-rar, irt-rar, itet-rar, il-rar, ilt-rar; Passive: im-rar, im^r-rar, im^rt-rar, imtet rar, etc.) Especially important is the series formed from abstract nouns. These are what are generally called "factitive verbs" ; for example, i-tab, from tab, "beauty," means "to make beautiful," to "beautify." Toi, "sweetness," gives i-tol, "to sweeten." So we have, i-tav, "to raise," i-tath, "to level," i-tif, "to lighten," t-tom, "to salt," i-tuk, "to make to stink," and so forth. The only drawback to these is that they are in the present tense of the same form as the past tense of those of the series tab, ieb, etc. For instance, it-ar is the past tense of the verb iar, and so means "was dark," whilst i-tar means "darkens." But neither in the spoken nor the written language will this be found to cause any confusion in practice.

Two consonants may be used to qualify the same sense vowel. In such a case it does not in the least matter, so far as the sense is concerned, which of them comes first. Thus "green" may be either at*sh or ash*t, whichever happens to be the easier word to say. You cannot be misunderstood either way. The numeral adjectives are distinguished by beginning with the letter y which, as has been seen, is the sign of the plural in nouns. The first ten numbers are each formed of a word connected in some way with the number indicated. The others are formed by composition from these. 1 is ysav (head) 6 is ytit (frost) 2 is ysia (eye) 7 is ydap (planet) 3 is ykap (lily) 8 is ylis (wind) 4 is yset (hoof) 9 is yteg (knowledge) 5 is ysigi (finger) 10 is yob (perfect) The numbers from eleven to nineteen are made by putting "ten" before "one," "two," "three," etc.: 11, y?bsav, 12, y?bsia, 13, y?bkap, and so on. The multiples of ten have the multiplier in front of the ?b: 20, ysi?b; 30, ykap?b; 40, yset?b; 50, ysig?b, etc., the words for twenty and fifty being contracted where the two vowels come to gether. 100 is y?bag, "great ten." The ordinals are expressed by, 0 shysav, i. e., "of place one"; 0 shysia, "of place two," 0 shykap, "of place three," etc. The adverbs "firstly," "secondly," "thirdly"' are made by add ing the adverbial sign u to the cardinal numbers: ysavu, ysiau, ykapu, etc. Words including the idea of number in a less definite manner are : y, "some" ; yag, "many" ; 0 thy, "sometimes" ; 0 thyag, "often" ; the construction of these should present no difficulty to the student.</page><page sequence="15">3H THE MONIST. Interrogation is expressed by beginning the sentence with the word que, or some word beginning with qu. Que stay o majal i arf, "Are the girl's eyes dark?" Interrogative words are : Quado, "where" ; quadso, "whither" ; quasso, "whence"; quo, "why"; queme, "who"; quede, "what"; quagu, "how" (to what degree) ; quabu, "how" (in what manner) ; quethe, "when." The letter as an initial is reserved to express the idea of negation. First we have the simple ne, "not." Then we get such adjectives as nish, "blunt," from ish, "sharp"; and nouns such as tenish, "bluntness," corresponding to tish, "sharpness." In verbs the comes before the root but after the verbal prefix ; e. g., from iath, "to be level," we have math, "to be rough," iltenath, "would have been rough" ; and from itath, "to level," itenath, "to roughen," with passive pluperfect, imetet-tenath, "had been roughened." One of the most striking features of a language formed on such principles as these is its economy of material, since every com bination of sounds carries with it a definite meaning. Whereas all the languages now in use, and probably all the languages which ever have been used, are encumbered with sesquepedalian terms while at the same time they wastefully make no use at all of numbers of the shortest and most easily pronounced combinations. Thus in our own language we have indeed the words "dig," "dog," and "dug," each compactly and clearly expressing an idea. But we have attached no meaning at all to the equally clear and simple sounds "dag" and "deg." These simple monosyllables are wasted whilst we take up our time and exhaust our inkpots with such words as "notwithstanding" and "anthropomorphism." If you take the consonants in pairs and place between them in succession each of the five vowels, you will find, I think, that only in the case of the b-g series?bag, beg, big, bog, bug?are all the five resulting words made use of in English. Now in Tel every such combination would have its meaning and express an idea consisting of three elements. Thus dag is "a thing which looks big" and deg is "a loud sounding thing." The foregoing pages do not, of course, claim to contain a per fect language, but only to suggest a principle on which, if a few competent persons were to work together, they might soon evolve a code in which any person who can read and write would be able to express at least his simpler thoughts to any other person equally</page><page sequence="16">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS.
