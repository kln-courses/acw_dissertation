<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. M. CIORAN A Bouquet of Heads Canny Old Socrates IF HE HAD GIVEN US any precise notion of the nature of his demon, he would have squandered a good part of his glory. His canny caution stirred as much curiosity about him among the ancients as among moderns, and moreover allowed the historians of phi- losophy to dwell ponderously on a problem having nothing what- ever to do with their real preoccupations. Socrates reminds us of another case: Pascal. The Demon and the Abyss: for philosophy these are two fetching weaknesses, two pirouettes .... The abyss in question, be it said, is, of the two, the least baffling. Nothing is more natural for a soul in open struggle with reason than to recognize the abyss and call on it for help. But was it natural for the inventor of the concept, the promoter of rationalism, to act on the authority of "inner voices"? Such an ambiguity is useful all the same to a thinker who has his eye on posterity. We are not much bothered by a consistent rationalist: we guess what he is getting at, and leave him to his own system. Socrates was both calculating and inspired and knew very well what twist to put on his contradictions, to surprise and disconcert us. Was his demon purely psychological or did it cor- respond, on the contrary, to some profound reality? Was it of divine origin or was it only a response to some moral need? Did he really hear it or was it simply an hallucination? Hegel took it as a purely subjective oracle, with nothing outward about it; Nietzsche thought it was a comedian's trick. How is it possible to believe that anyone, for a whole life-time, could play at being the man-who-hears-voices? To keep up such a role would have been a difficult if not impossible undertaking, even for Socrates. It doesn't matter, at bottom, whether he was ruled by his demon or merely used him for the cause! If he created him out of nothing, no doubt it was because he had to, if only to make himself inscrutable to others. As a solitary sur- rounded by followers, his first duty was to escape them by fencing himself off in mystery, feigned or real. How can you tell the dif- ference between a real demon and a fake? Between a secret and</page><page sequence="2">THE HUDSON REVIEW an apparent secret? How can we tell whether Socrates was really wandering or simply being foxy? Yet, it is true that even when we are indifferent to his teaching, the talk he touched off about himself fascinates us. Was he not the first thinker to set himself up as a case? Was it not with him that the insoluble problem began: the problem of sincerity? The Wrong Side of a Garden When the problem of happiness replaced the problem of knowledge, philosophy had deserted its proper domain and taken up a suspect activity: an interest in man. ... It was now com- pletely absorbed in questions it would not have stooped to before, and it tried, with an air of great seriousness, to answer them. "How can we keep from suffering?" This, first and foremost, was the question to be answered. Philosophy had entered a phase of weari- ness: gradually turning away from its impersonal concerns, its de- sire to know, it gave up speculation. In place of disturbing truths, it set up comforting ones. That was the sort of truth a ruined and enslaved Greece wanted from Epicurus; she was on the look-out for some restful formula, some remedy for anxiety. Epicurus was for his time what psycho- analysts are for ours. Did he not also, in his own way, denounce the "sickness of our civilization"? (In every confused and over- refined era, a Freud tries to unburden the soul.) With Epicurus, even more than with Socrates, philosophy shifted toward therapy. To heal, but above all to heal himself: that was his ambition. Although he wanted to deliver men from the fear of death and fear of the gods, he suffered from both fears himself. The ataraxia he prided himself on was not his ordinary state of mind: his "sensibility" was notorious. As for his contempt for the sci- ences-for which he was blamed later on-we know this is often characteristic of "wounded sensibilities." This theorist of hap- piness was a sick man. He vomited, so it seems, twice a day. In what misery he floundered, for so despising the "perturbations of the soul"! The little serenity he was able to manage was no doubt reserved for the benefit of his disciples. Grateful and naive, they created his reputation for wisdom. Our own illusions being much feebler than those of his contemporaries, we easily see straight through to the wrong side of his Garden. 492</page><page sequence="3">E. M. CIORAN Saint Paul We can never blame him enough for making Christianity an inelegant religion. For foisting off on it the most detestable tradi- tions of the Old Testament: intolerance, violence, provincialism. With what indiscretion he meddles in things that are none of his business, about which he knows absolutely nothing! His pro- nouncements on virginity, abstinence and marriage are simply nauseating. In shaping our religious and moral prejudices, he fixed the norms of stupidity and multiplied the restrictions that still paralyze our instincts. From the old prophets he took none of their lyricism, nothing of their elegiac and cosmic tone. What he took was their sectarian spirit and all their bad taste, the drivel, the crazy utterances for the benefit of the crowd. Morals interested him in the highest de- gree. He has only to mention them and you can see him vibrate with malice. He is obsessed by the city-the one he wanted to de- stroy as well as the one he wanted to build-and the relations be- tween men and God interest him far less than those between men. Look closely at the famous Epistles: you will not find one moment of repose or delicacy, of contemplation or discrimination. Nothing but rage, huffing, lowbrow hysteria. There is no comprehension of the mind, the solitude of understanding. There are intermediaries everywhere, family ties, and the family spirit: Father, Mother, Son, angels, saints. There is not a trace of intellectuality, of definite concepts, nobody who wants to understand. Nothing but sins and recompenses, the bookkeeping of vices and virtues. His is a re- ligion without questions, a debauch of anthropomorphism. I blush for the God he offers us. It is our duty to disqualify Him, but con- sidering what He has come to, He is done for anyway. Neither Lao-tse nor the Buddha appeals to an identifiable Be- ing. Wary of the maneuvers of faith, they invite us to meditate, and, so that meditation should not run on in a vacuum, they fixed its object: the Tao or Nirvana. They had a different idea of man. How can you meditate if you must always come back to an in- dividual Being... even though He is Supreme? With psalms and prayers you are not looking for anything, you don't discover any- thing. People personify and implore the divinity out of laziness. When the gods began to seem insufficient, the Greeks woke up to philosophy; concepts began when the Olympians were finished. 493</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW To think is to cease venerating: thought is a revolt against mys- tery, a declaration of its bankruptcy. The convert, when he adopts an alien doctrine, thinks he is taking a step toward himself, but in reality he is only side-stepping his problems. To escape the sense of insecurity that dominates him, he latches onto the first cause that comes along. And once in possession of "the truth," he wreaks vengeance on others for his old uncertainties, his old fears. Such was the case of that typical convert, Saint Paul. His grandiose airs scarcely covered up the anxiety he tried so unsuccessfully to control. Like all neophytes, he thought his new faith would change his nature and resolve those doubts he was careful not to mention to his correspondents and his listeners. His game no longer deceives us, but countless minds at the time were taken in. True, it was a time when people were searching for "the truth," when they were not interested in individual cases. If our apostle was badly re- ceived at Athens, if he found himself amongst people who obsti- nately rejected his lucubrations, it was because there they still argued and sceptics, far from abdicating their position, still de- fended it. His Christian twaddle could make no headway in Athens, but to make up for that, it seduced Corinth, a city of the rabble, resistant to dialectics. The common people want to be knocked on the head by in- vective, threats and revelations, smashing speeches: they love windbags. Saint Paul was such a one, the most inspired, the most gifted, the shrewdest in the whole of antiquity. The noise he made ... we still get the echoes. He knew how to leap to the plat- form and bawl out his rage. Was it not he who introduced the tone of the market-place into the Greco-Roman world? The wise men of the time counselled silence, resignation, renunciation- ideas that were impractical. He, more adroit, came along with his enticing recipes, to save the riff-raff and demoralize the refined. His revenge on Athens was complete. If he had triumphed there, perhaps his hatred would have softened. Never has a defeat had such grave consequences. And if we are pagans . . . mutilated, blasted, crucified pagans, put through a profound and unfor- gettable vulgarity, a vulgarity two thousand years old, we owe it to that defeat. A Jew-not-a-Jew, a perverted Jew, a traitor. The impression of insincerity emanating from his appeals, his exhortations, his vio- 494</page><page sequence="5">E. M. CIORAN lence, comes from that. He is suspect: he acts too convinced. You don't know where to take hold of him, how to define him: situ- ated as he was at the crossroads of history, he certainly underwent many influences. After hesitating among numerous paths, he ended by choosing one, the right one. His sort know how to play the game: haunted by posterity, by the echoes their actions will set off, if they sacrifice themselves to a cause they do so as victims who will get results ... efficacious victims. When I am looking around for someone to take out a grudge on, I open the Epistles and right away I feel reassured. There is my man. He terrifies me, makes me shudder. To hate him close on, as a contemporary, I make a clean sweep of twenty centuries and follow him on his rounds. His success disheartens me, the tortures inflicted on him fill me with pleasure. The frenzy he arouses in me ... I turn it against him: this was not, alas, the way the Em- pire operated. A rotten civilization comes to terms with its disease, loves the virus that consumes it, loses its self-respect, lets a Saint Paul cir- culate.... In doing so, it declares itself beaten, ruined, finished. The odor of carrion draws and excites apostles, those greedy and loquacious grave-diggers. A world of magnificence and light gave way before those ag- gressive "enemies of the Muses," those fanatics who, even today, fill us with a panic mixed with repugnance. The pagan world treated them with irony, a harmless weapon, too noble to reduce a horde insensitive to the finer points. The Boeotian who prays always gets the best of the cultivated man who thinks-who, stuck on his mountain-top of contempt and amusement, succumbs to the first assault. Dynamism, the privilege of the dregs, always comes from the bottom. The horrors of the ancient world were preferable, a thousand times, to the horrors of Christianity. These fevered heads, these souls filled with ridiculous remorse, these wreckers of the gracious life dreamed by an over-refined society-they set about maltreat- ing people's consciences in order to make "hearts" of them. The most competent set about with a wilfulness that at first repelled the intelligent, but later was destined to mark and disturb them, and make them a part of their unspeakable enterprise. The Greco-Roman twilight deserved a better enemy, a better promise, a better religion. How can you believe even in the 495</page><page sequence="6">THE HUIDSON REVIEW shadow of progress when you remember that those Christian fables, with no trouble at all, smothered Stoicism! If Stoicism had been able to grow and spread, to seize hold of the world, man would have come through, or almost. Resignation, made obliga- tory, would have taught us to endure our suffering with dignity, to silence our voices, to face our Nothingness coldly. Would po- etry have vanished from our practices? Let poetry go! In exchange we would have developed the ability to endure our trials without fuss. To accuse no one, to stoop neither to sadness, nor joy, nor regret, to reduce our connection with the world to a harmonious play of defeat, to live condemned and serene, never imploring the deity but rather putting him on notice. . . . That was not possible. Stoicism, overrun from all sides and faithful to its prin- ciples, had the elegance to die without a struggle. A religion founds itself on the ruins of wisdom, but the tactics used by re- ligion are scarcely appropriate to wisdom. Men will always prefer to despair on their knees rather than standing up. Salvation-it is man's cowardice and weariness that make him aspire to it; he is incapable of rising to inconsolability and finding in it a reason for pride. Anyone dishonors himself who dies escorted by the hopes that kept him alive. Let the crowd and the haranguers crawl toward "the ideal" and bog down in it! Solitude is not a gift, it is a mission: to rise to it, to take it upon oneself, is to renounce that portion of baseness needed to guarantee the success of any enterprise whatever, religious or otherwise. Look back over the history of ideas, actions and attitudes: you will see that the future has always been the accomplice of the rabble. No one preaches in the name of Marcus Aurelius: since he spoke only to himself, he had neither disciples nor followers. On the other hand, temples continue to be built where certain Epistles are still recited ad nauseam. So long as that is how it is, I will pursue, hammer and tongs, the one who so shrewdly involved us in his torment. Luther It's not enough to have faith; beyond that, you must suffer it, like a malediction. You must see in God an enemy, an executioner, a monster; you must project onto Him everything inhuman you are capable of, or dream of, and yet love Him in spite of that. The 496</page><page sequence="7">E. M. CIORAN 497 Church has made Him out dim-witted, degenerate, lovable. Lu- ther protests: God, he maintains, is neither the "blockhead," nor the "meek in spirit," nor the "cuckold" we have been given to worship. He is a "devouring fire," madder, "more terrible than the devil"; he thrives on torturing us. Not that Luther's respect for Him is timid. Sometimes he tells Him off, talks to Him as an equal: "If God does not protect me and save my honor, the shame is His." Luther can get down on his knees and grovel; he knows how to be insolent, how to make a prayer sound like a provoca- tion, how to begin with a sigh and end with a reprimand. He prays like a debater. For worship and cursing, any old term is good enough, even the most vulgar. By calling God to order, he gave a new meaning to humility, making it an exchange of miser- ies between the Creator and the creature. Enough of piety and unmanly anxiety! The least bit of aggression will restore faith: God pays no attention to tender supplications; He wants to be yelled at, pushed around; He loves those misunderstandings be- tween Him and His which the Church racks its brains to smooth out. In watching over the style of its faithful, the Church cuts them off from Heaven; Heaven responds only to cursing, swear- ing, cries that come from the entrails-expressions that defy both theological censure and good taste, even . . . reason itself. If you want to know what reason is good for, don't ask phi- losophers-it's their business to respect and defend it. If you want to get to the bottom of its secret, go to those who know it to their cost, know it in their bones. It is not by chance that Luther called it a whore. For that is what it is, in its nature and its habits. Does it not live by make-believe, inconstancy, and shamelessness? Since it does not attach to anything, since it is nothing, it gives itself to everybody, and anyone can claim it: the just and the unjust, martyr or tyrant. There is no cause it will not serve: it levels everything, without reservation, misgiving, or preference; the first come gets its favors. Only the naive call it our greatest good. Luther unmasked it. It's true it is not given to everyone to be visited by the Devil. There are those souls who throw themselves in the way of temptation, who live on an intimate footing with the Devil and only flee him the better to find him .... "I carry him hanging around my neck," Luther said. "He sleeps beside me in my bed</page><page sequence="8">THE HUDSON REVIEW oftener than my wife." In the end, he even asked "if the Devil might not be God." Far from being a haven, Luther's faith was a deliberately pro- voked disaster, a peril that flattered and elevated him in his own eyes. If a religion were pure, it would be sterile: if anything in it is profound and virulent, it is not the divine but the demoniac. To try to rescue it from any connection with the Devil is to degrade it, make it anemic and sickly-sweet. To believe in the reality of salvation, you must first believe in the reality of the fall: every religious act begins with a perception of hell-the raw material of faith. Heaven comes along only afterward as a corrective and a consolation: a luxury, a superfetation, an accident required by our taste for equilibrium and symmetry. Only the Devil is necessary. The religion that dispenses with him sickens, wastes away, be- comes a shapeless rationalized piety. He who seeks salvation at any cost will never make a great career in religion. It is to the Reformation's credit that it troubled the sleep of conscience, denied it the narcotics of Rome, and in the place of the image of a benign God and a commonplace Satan it set up a dubious God and an all-powerful Devil. The idea of predestina- tion, as Luther knew, is immoral. So, for him, all the more reason to support and promote it. His mission was to charge into others' minds and scandalize them, to aggravate their anguish, drive them back against a wall of impossible hope; in a word, to cut down the number of the elect. He was honest enough to admit he yielded on certain points to the suggestions of the Enemy . . . which explains his audacity in condemning the majority of be- lievers. Did he mean to panic them? Without a doubt. It is the cynicism of prophets that reconciles us to their doctrines, and even to their victims. Despite his incapacity for hope, he cut the figure of a liberator. More than one emancipation movement proceeds directly from him. His reason for proclaiming the absolute sovereignty of God was to cut down all other authority. "To be a prince without being a brigand is almost impossible," he said. His maxims on sedition are beautiful, those on heresy even more so. If Europe was formed by a series of schisms, if its glories come from a parade of heterodoxies, it is Luther's doing. He was the father of many an innovator but he had the advantage of them all in not going over to optimism, a vice that is the disgrace of revolutions. Being 498</page><page sequence="9">E. M. CIORAN nearer than we are to the sources of Sin, he could not help know- ing that to liberate man is not necessarily to save him. Tossed back and forth between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, torn between his convictions and his conflicts, this Rabelais of anguish was better suited than anybody to bolster Christianity as it was running down, dying out. He was the only one who knew how to make it gloomy. His piety was black. Even Pascal's, even Kierkegaard's, are pale beside his; the first was too much of a writer, the other too much of a philosopher. But Lu- ther, with the strength of his peasant neurasthenia, had the right instincts for wrestling with the forces of both Good and Evil. Familiar and racy as he is, his vulgarity is never repulsive. There is nothing false about him, nothing of the typical apostle-neither their knowing hatred nor their studied violence. And a note of humor, something completely lacking in those boosters of the Cross, breaks through the unceremoniousness of his terror. Luther? A Saint Paul, humanized. The Pleasures of the Abyss When a believer finds that he is intolerant of any solution, of any attempt to shut off the processes of knowledge, when he de- velops a distaste for conclusion, when he feels like this, all he can think of is to punish himself for having yielded to the blandish- ments of salvation. That is why he invents sin, or turns toward his own "dark night." The latter, too effective to have been merely invented, lays hold of his faith, unsettles it, and turns it into an eclipse of the Light. I cannot resist reading religious thinkers, luxuriating in their terrors, feasting on them. I look on, in raptures, at Pascal's and am amazed to see how close he is to us. Senancour is Pascal gone diffuse, Chateaubriand is Pascal bombastic. There are few themes in moder psychology he did not touch on or foreshadow. But he did even more: by cramming religion with doubts and likening it to a deliberate stupor, he rehabilitated it in the eyes of disbe- lievers. Ambitious, fractious, and nosy in his own way, this gossip- columnist of heaven and hell was no doubt jealous of the saints, resentful because he was not their equal, because all he had to use against them was his torn faith. Lucky that it was torn-other- 499</page><page sequence="10">THE HUDSON REVIEW wise he would have left us a few insipid Little Flowers or a sopo- rific Introduction to the Devout Life. Boredom, a condition that engrossed him somewhat more than grace, is what he thinks of endlessly. He makes it our substance, the "venom" of our minds, the principle that resides "in the bot- tom of our hearts." Is it possible he was only pretending, in order to feel it? Nothing could be more false. We can play at charity or piety, pray deliberately (which is what he did), fold our hands and strike an attitude to suit the occasion (which is what he recom- mended); but boredom-no exercise, no tradition, no method prepares us for it; no doctrine advocates it, no belief exonerates it. It is a feeling with a curse on it. Pascal responded to it be- cause he had it inside him, and perhaps loved its "venom." He is obsessed by it, just as he is by "glory"-he speaks of the latter with so much insight we can hardly imagine he was using it sim- ply as a pretext for denouncing our vanity. He described our need for it, analyzed it in all its details-suspect and revealing minutiae. An obsession with glory often hides the operations of boredom. Ambiguous, like all moralists, and eager to rivet us to our torment and our wounds, he taught us to hate ourselves and to savor our spasms of self-loathing. If our consciences are running sores, if we are pest-ridden ecstatics, enthusiasts of our own rotten- ness, the responsibility rests with him. He is spiritual and sensual at once: when he contemplates our insignificance we can feel him quiver with pleasure. He is drunk on our nothingness; he is stirred by anything that cancels us out. The gulf between the infinite and the infinitesimal throws him into exaltation; he participates like a connoisseur in the spectacle of our corruption. Was it not he who taught us the art of extract- ing from our miseries the substance of our joys? The pleasures of self-hatred: the pleasures of the abyss! Let's stop pitying the man who discovered an abyss right beside him. No doubt he drew out of it many a delight ... and-to save face -feigned terror. Even the greatest writers lie, when it comes to their own voluptuous pleasures: peering into the abyss is one of them. You need to be shameless in the modem way to own up to it without blushing; you need that naked curiosity we all feel about our own secrets. It may be that those soundings "of the heart" led to the discovery of the Unconscious, the latest version of Pascal's "abyss." 500</page><page sequence="11">E. M. CIORAN Gogol Certain witnesses-they are rare, it is true-make him out a saint; others, more frequently, a phantom. "There was so little of the living creature about him when he was alive," wrote Aksakoff the day after Gogol died, "that afraid as I am of corpses-I can't bear the sight of them-I didn't feel anything like that when I stood in front of his." Gogol was tortured by cold. It never left him, and he never stopped repeating, "I am shivering . . . shivering." He rushed from country to country, consulted doctors, went from hospital to hospital. No climate can ever cure that inner cold. He is not known to have had any intimate relationships. His biographers speak openly of his impotence. There is no defect more isolating than that. The impotent man draws on an inner strength that makes him peculiar and lonely, inaccessible and, paradoxically, dangerous: he frightens people. He is an animal that has emerged from animality, a man of no breed, a life deserted by instinct; he is lifted up by what he has lost; he is the preferred victim of the spirit. Can you imagine an impotent rat? Rodents accomplish the act in question marvellously. No one can say as much for human beings. The more exceptional they are, the more likely they are to be deficient in that major way which wrenches them out of the chain of beings. They are permitted every activity except the one that connects them with the zoological family. Sexuality equalizes us, or better, it takes our mystery from us.... Much more than our other needs and enterprises, it puts us on an equal footing with our own kind. The more we practice it, the more we become like everybody else. It is in the accomplishment of a so-called bestial act that we prove we are citizens. Nothing is more public than the sexual act. Abstinence, either forced or voluntary, places the individual both above and below the Species. He is, in fact, a melange of saint and idiot, who puzzles and astounds us. From that comes the equivocal distaste we feel for monks, or for any man who has re- nounced women, renounced his resemblance to us. We can never forgive him his solitude. It humiliates as much as it disgusts us; it arouses us. The strange superiority conferred by a defect! Gogol confessed one day that if he had given in to love, he would have been "reduced instantly to dust." Such a confession staggers and 501</page><page sequence="12">THE HUDSON REVIEW fascinates us, makes us think of the "secret" of Kierkegaard and his "thorn in the flesh." However, the Danish philosopher was erotic by nature. The breaking off of his engagement, his failure in love, tormented him all his life and marked even his theological writings. Must one then compare Gogol to Swift, that other "blighted one"? That would be forgetting that Swift had, if not the chance to love, at least the chance to victimize. In order to situate Gogol, we have to imagine Swift without Stella, without Vanessa. "The human beings we have before our eyes in The Govern- ment Inspector or in Dead Souls," one biographer observes, "are 'nothing.' And being 'nothing,' they are 'everything.'" In effect, they lack "substance," and from this comes their uni- versality. What are Tchitchikov, Pliushkin, Sobakevitch, Nozdrev, Manilov, the hero of The Overcoat, or the hero of The Nose, if not ourselves reduced to our essence? Empty souls, says Gogol. For all that, they rise to a kind of grandeur: flat grandeur. He might be called the Shakespeare of the trivial, a Shakespeare chained to the observations of our little habits, our petty obses- sions, the web of our lives. No one has gone farther than Gogol in his perception of daily life. Because of their reality his char- acters cease to exist, turn into symbols in which we recognize our whole selves. They do not decay; they are decayed and always have been. We can't help thinking of The Possessed. But while Dostoievsky's characters rush toward their limits, Gogol's fall back on theirs. The former seem to respond to a call that is beyond them; the latter only to their own incommensurate triviality. Toward the end of his life, Gogol was overcome with remorse. His characters, he thought, were nothing but vice, vulgarity, filth. He wanted to give them some kind of virtue, snatch away their moral decay. So he wrote the second part of Dead Souls. Happily, he threw it in the fire; his heroes could not be "saved." This ges- ture, which has been laid to madness, came in reality out of his scruples as an artist. The writer got the better of the prophet. We like his ferocity, his contempt for men, his vision of a damned world. How could we have endured an edifying caricature? An irreparable loss, some say. A loss for the good, rather. The late Gogol is still possessed by an obscure force he does not know how to use. He sinks into a lethargy broken only at long intervals by disjointed activity, the activity of a spectre. His humor, 502</page><page sequence="13">E. M. CIORAN which had kept his "fits of anguish" at a distance, disappears. A pitiful period in his life begins. His friends abandon him. He was foolish enough to publish his Selected Correspondence which, as he recognized, was "an affront to the public, an affront to his friends, an affront to himself." Slavophiles and Occidentalists alike repudiated him. His book was an apology for power, for slavery- a reactionary digression. In his misery he attached himself to a certain Father Matvei, a man impervious to art, narrow-minded, aggressive, who had over him the power of a confessor, a torturer. He carried the letters he received from Matvei around with him, reading and re-reading them: a remedy so stupid and idiotic it makes Pascal's stupefy-yourself seem like a mere caprice. When a writer's talent gives out, some conscience-keeper steps in to fill up the vacuum of inspiration with nonsense. Pushkin encouraged his genius; the other set about smothering what was left of it ... Preaching didn't satisfy Gogol; he wanted punishment too. His work gave universal meaning to farce, to the grimace; his religious torment suffered from it. Some maintained that Gogol deserved his misery, that by it he was paying for his audacity in deforming the figure of man. The contrary seems to me true. He had to pay for being right. In mat- ters of art, it is not our errors we pay for, but our "truth," what- ever inklings of truth we have really seen. His characters pur- sued him; he carried the Klestakovs and the Tchitchikovs with him always, as he confessed, and their sub-humanity crushed him. He was never able to save one of them; as an artist, he could not. When he had lost the power to write, he tried to save his soul. The heroes he had created kept him from it. In spite of himself, he had to remain faithful to their nothingness. In this case, it is not the Regent, Philippe d'Orl6ans, we are reminded of (who, according to Saint Simon, was "born bored"), nor Baudelaire nor the Preacher of Ecclesiastes, nor even the Devil and his unemployment in a world where there is no evil. We think rather of someone who turns his prayers against himself. At this point, boredom attains a kind of mystical dignity. "All absolute sensation is religious," Novalis said. In time, boredom replaced religious faith in Gogol, and became for him an absolute sensation, a religion. [Translated from the French by Marthiel Mathews] 503</page></plain_text>
