US$62.50 (hardback), $20.95 (pbk) For the reader who has been lulled to sleep by the Utopian harmony and peace of Christian community, Nava's book brings an abrupt awakening. To overturn a New Age, soft and fuzzy, conception of Christianity, Nava draws on the mystical thought of Simone Weil and the prophetic thought of Gustavo Gutierrez. It may appear strange to discuss Weil and Gutierrez in the same breath, yet the justification offered by Nava for the uneasy alliance is to critique the reduction of mysticism to a feeling or an experience. This reductionism has led to a pure subjectivity, a position from which it is impossible to regain solidarity with others who exist outside of the self. For Nava, the most famous version of this turn to pure subjectivity is Descartes' cogito ergo sum ("I think therefore I am"), that culminated in a private religion in which "knowledge of God ... is at a different level altogether than intellectual (or aesthetical and ethical) achievement"(p. 73). For Nava, this Cartesian inferiority results in do-it-yourself ideologies, substitute gods and a "specious mysticism [that] flees from historical existence in order to evade the pain of time, especially the consent to necessity via human labour" (p. 26). To counter this modernist heresy, surprisingly Nava invokes that icon of metaphysicians: Plato, in particular, his notion of the Good. When one asks why, the answer is: Goodness, or the best life, can only be attained by looking outward, attuning oneself to a rational cosmic order that is installed somewhere in the sky accessible only in the otherworldly intuitions of art, religion and philosophy. The love of this exterior cosmic order empowers people to order their own lives to the Good. The good life consists of imitating this vision of a pre-existing, unchanging, external order of reality, by subordinating one's passions to one's reason. By identifying meaning with a first principle, that is, the idea of the Good itself, this is said to overturn philosophies that uphold the subjective as the end-in-itself and as the supreme value. While it would take a longer and more detailed argument to make such a connection clear, without a vague sense of the Good, Nava quoting Weil says, we slip into the "illusion of being the centre of space"(p. 55). Placing the self at the centre has issued in visions that glorify unrestricted freedom, amoral force, and arbitrary assertiveness on the part of individuals, groups, and sometimes 191</page><page sequence="2">Mystics Quarterly whole nations. Yet another weakness of turning to the self is a belief that there are no standards set above the individual. This gives rise to meaninglessness and banality. Nava notes that the connection between Weil and Gutierrez emerges out of this repudiation of all given phenomena to identity with consciousness. Gutierrez's liberation theology rejects anthropomorphism or the cogito ergo sum, as the book of Job makes evident. On Job Nava, quoting Gutierrez, says that "the speeches of God have brought home the fact that human beings are not the centre of the universe and that not everything has been made for their service" (p. 87). Nava notes that Gutierrez faults modernity for reducing God to human interests: this is echoed by Weil. Unlike Weil, however, Gutierrez is not so much concerned with the way to live one's life as he is with our relationship to others. We need to ask what is our responsibility to a fellow citizen who suffers from persecution; or to the man across the street with Aids; or to the street urchin in South America; or to the beggar in your back yard? In redirecting attention away from metaphysical ideas he wants to show those metaphysical ideas hardly function in the lived environment, only in the academy, and they need not do so there either. For Gutierrez, knowledge must be deconstructed into the context. The difference between supposedly objective and non-objective standpoints can be understood as the degree to which existential concerns are implicated in their disclosures. His existential theology amounts to a revision of what knowledge and truth mean. Gutierrez sums up his existential starting point as "involving a profound contact with God in the face of the neighbour" (p. 90). "It is with them," he says, "that we live out the message. Faith cannot live in pure privacy with the self; it is the negation of every turning in upon the self" (p. 93). Part of the purpose of Nava's book is to surmount subjectivism that makes the ego the fundament of all knowledge and consciousness. The philosopher Martin Heidegger has taken a similar recourse; however, Plato's philosophical world view is reproached for sowing the poisoned seed of the modem turn to the self. Heidegger's Being and Time, in which he argues that there occurs in Cartesian metaphysics a deepening of Platonic interiority, is everywhere explicit on this. Heidegger's criticism of the Western preoccupation with interiority is echoed in the existentialism of Jean Paul Sartre, the hermeneutics of Hans-George Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur. These theorists have in common a notion that embodiment, corporeality, materiality, physicality are culturally specified yet essential conditions of being and knowing. We cannot at any time take them out of the picture. To this end it 192</page><page sequence="3">Vol28,#4, December 2002 becomes especially necessary to undermine the whole cult and culture of the idea; to repudiate philosophy as Plato initiated it. Theology, Metaphysics and Morality become the universal opiates through which this alienated condition is sustained. Nava ignores this debate as far as possible in order to establish a pseudo-connection between Weil's Platonism and Gutierrez's existentialism. If we leave aside for one moment the question as to whether these frameworks are compatible, Nava's analysis is a welcome corrective to a private, subjective religion. In an age where Christianity seems to have lost its nerve, Nava's reading of Gutierrez's existentialism attempts to subvert the withdrawal into a nether world of pure thought and urges us to look outward. For Nava, Christianity requires an outward response to the suffering of the world which visibly surrounds us, all those things which postmodernists hardly seemed to notice. Applying Weil's enlightened mysticism, which is set within a framework of objective truth, requires that we praise the good, condemn evil, and seek purpose and value in our activities. Otherwise, Christian spirituality will be seen as another subjective option. God will be trivialized by being reduced to a mere means to avert boredom, create excitement, enhance self-image or give some order and sanity to family life. Yet in reading Gutierrez out of context and into the realm of Weil's enlightened mysticism, Nava runs into a basic problem: subjectivism is not overcome but reinstated. Through a focus on the Good there is the idea that we are disembodied, but in fact we are not. Subjectivism is not something one can drop at one's pleasure, like an old, worn-out pair of shoes, or set aside, like a game with which one has become bored or a conversation that has gone stale. The human mind is simply unable to step outside of the sensible world in order to represent that world from the point of view of some kind of omniscient interpreter. So perhaps this notion that we can transcend subjectivism is in the end Nava's own private fiction. Ree Bodde University of Auckland 193</page></plain_text>
