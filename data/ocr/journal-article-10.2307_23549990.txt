<plain_text><page sequence="1">"I DON'T DO SYSTEMS": AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ1 Arun Micheelsen I had the. honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Ofparticu lar interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz empha sizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and herme neutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenom enology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Further more, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way. Introduction Most students of religion know that Geertz has had an enormous impact on the general study of religion with his interpretive anthropology. On the one hand, he has opened new and stimulating areas of re search through his interpretive perspective. This perspective, with its definition of religion as a cultural system and, therefore, as a sym bolic system, has helped the study of religion to understand the 1 I would like to thank Jeppe S.Jensen, Armin W. Geertz, and the Department of the Study of Religions at the University of Aarhus for advice and funding. 1 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2002 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 14, 2-20</page><page sequence="2">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ Ó mechanisms and processes which create and communicate meaning within historical and cultural perspective. This is partially possible because of the emphasis he placed on culture, system, symbol, sym bolization and "thick description" methodology. On the other hand, the shift in focus—and the resulting partial emancipation from traditional anthropological paradigms—has gen erated an ongoing debate in the study of religion. This debate has to some extent evolved around the issue of our task as researchers of religion, the definition of science, and the concept of interpretation.2 There are a number of reasons for this, but the main one is that Geertz's characteristic way of introducing his thoughts, his literary style, and inherent theoretical assumptions are challenging. This is not meant to be a critique of Geertz's research, but there remain still—after all these years—a few central points that could be clarified for the benefit of scholars of religion. Therefore, this interview fo cuses on Geertz's disciplinary background, his theory of meaning, his opinion on method, and his definition of the symbol. I hope that it will be beneficial in the sense that it is Geertz who clarifies his view points on these matters and, furthermore, that my concluding re marks may help shed some light on Geertz's research for those of us who "do systems". The interview Micheelsen: I would like to ask you how you came to focus so explicitly on the phenomenon of culture? Geertz: In Available Light I tell in length of how I worked with Clyde Kluckhohn and A. L. Kroeber on their Culture book as their assist ant, which of course influenced me (Geertz 2000: 12; Handler 1991: 604; Kluckhohn &amp; Kroeber 1963 [1952]: v). The other reason is that I came out of a humanistic background. I had studied philosophy and literature, not anthropology or social sciences. I actually never had an anthropology course before I came to Harvard. Therefore, I naturally went toward culture with that background. Micheelsen: Did yourfeldwork in Indonesia in the 1950s also inspire you to focus on culture? 2 The debate, which has been going on for almost three decades, is too extensive to comment on here. For an introduction to and critical review of and some good references to Geertz's work, see Ortner (1999).</page><page sequence="3">4 ARUN MICHEELSEN Geertz: Well—I went to Indonesia with a team, and it was my task to study religion, which gets you into cultural matters rather quickly. Because I did my thesis on religion, I suppose I ended up with cul ture, but I would have ended there anyway (Geertz 1960). Micheelsen: If we look at your work and method, you write in Person, Time, and Conduct in Bali that: What we want and do not yet have is a developed method of describing and analyzing the meaningful structure of experience (here, the experi ence of persons) as it is apprehended by representative members of a particular society at a particular point in time—in a word, a scientific phenomenology of culture. (Geertz 1966: 7) Do you feel that you have reached this point, i.e., developed a scientific phenom enology of culture? Geertz: I do not know if I have reached it, but I certainly continue to work on it. I recently did a seminar with Thomas Luckmann, and we talked about phenomenology—his approach to it and mine. My phenomenological approach is not unlike Luckmann's or Peter Berger's (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Although for them—as for Edmund Husserl—phenomenology is a prior subject. They do that before they do the analysis, understood as a general consideration about the life world. I have no objection to that, but I do not work that way. I work directly empirically. Therefore, whatever pheno menological developments occur in my thoughts, occur in the con text of analyzing the material. Consequently, it is not a prior notion or a prior philosophy of culture that I have. I am not against it, but it is not what I do. The question of science is another matter here. Nevertheless, I think that phenomenology of culture is what I have been doing in all my work. Not just in Person, Time, and Conduct in Bali, but also in Negara where I talk about the phenomenology of power (Geertz 1980: 85). Maybe I did not use those terms, but that is the general approach I have, i.e., to describe the life world in which people live, using more of the late Ludwig Wittgenstein than Husserl. The science part I might leave out now, but I do not feel that I am close to some kind of omega point, i.e., a final scientific phenomenol ogy of culture—though, I think, I have been developing a general phenomenological approach to culture or at least an approach that is consistent with phenomenologists like Luckmann and Berger. There are of course some problems with Husserl which I would have trou ble with, like the transcendent ego and the Cartesianism that exist in some forms of phenomenology. Nevertheless, I think I have learned a</page><page sequence="4">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 5 lot from those people and I try to apply it in my work. Especially as time goes, since I have become more interested in how people see things and how they understand their life world. Micheelsen: But does that mean that you also have to be hermeneutic in your approach? Geertz: Yes—I have been much influenced by Paul Ricoeur and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Perhaps more by Ricoeur. However, her meneutics inevitably takes you into phenomenology, or at least a phenomenological descriptive approach (Geertz 1980: 103-104). Again—I work empirically. Both Ricoeur and Gadamer are inter ested in the general possibility of knowledge, which I have learned a lot from, but it is not what I am doing. I am trying to get some knowledge about some thing. I am trying to have an applied phenom enology, an applied hermeneutics, to really do a hermeneutic job on whatever it is that I am trying to understand. For example, the cock fight, which is an example of an attempt to get a phenomenology into a hermeneutic approach—and back again, which is also notice able in From the Native's Point of View (Geertz 1980: 103-104; Geertz 1983: 55-70; Geertz 1995: 114). So I see myself as belonging to the phenomenological tradition, although my work tends to be a little shy of a general philosophy of culture. Micheelsen: Could one then argue that you are eclectic when it comes to your theoretical presumptions—for example your use of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Susanne Langer, Gilbert Ryle, Talcott Parsons, Paul Ricoeur, Alfred Schutz, Max Weber and others? Geertz: Well, it is eclectic in the sense that they are different people, but they all have a similar focus, i.e., symbol, meaning, or the phi losophy of mind. Parsons introduced me to Weber's work, so I have to some degree a Parsonian view of Weber. The interpretation of Weber and, therefore, the discussion about Weber is of course whether he really believed in a social science with a scientific ap proach to culture, or if he believed in an interpretive one. I think one can read him either way—although I use him from the interpretive perspective. I am more interested in the sociology of religion than types of faith and so on. Langer, Wittgenstein, Schutz, and Ricoeur are all interested in meaning in some sense. Ryle was interested in the philosophy of mind (Ryle 1976). So I do not think it is an eclectic list. There are many people not there—all the positivists are missing. It is of course eclectic in disciplinary terms, but the list has an inner consistency.</page><page sequence="5">O ARUN MICHEELSEN Micheelsen: Did you feel that there was, within anthropology, a lack of tools when you started studying culture? Geertz: Yes, one did look around—first to Langer and Ryle, but always toward Weber. Later on toward Wittgenstein, Gadamer, and Schutz. Anthropology is a much better user of concepts than a devel oper of concepts. Most concepts are borrowed from other disciplines because anthropology is so empirically focused, or used to be. Micheelsen: In relationship to meaning, you say that: one cannot write a "General Theory of Cultural Interpretation." Or, one can, but there appears to be little profit in it, because the essential task of theory building here is not to codify abstract regularities but to make thick description possible, not to generalize across cases but to generalize within them. (Geertz 1993: 26) Nevertheless, is the particular interpretation not based on some kind of "theory of meaning", and if it is, what is your theory of meaning? Geertz: No, I do not think that a particular interpretation has to be based on a general theory of meaning—whatever that may be. I am not a meaning realist. I do not think meanings are out there to theorize about. One tries to look at behavior, what people say, and make sense of it—that is my theoretical approach to meaning. But no, I do not think I need a general theory of meaning. That is why I said that I differ a little bit from the phenomenologists. They concern themselves with general issues of meaning independently of any em pirical case. I am concerned with what some thing means—what the cockfight means, what a funeral means. I have a conceptual frame work—you have to have that—but a theory of meaning, which clas sifies meaning and formulates laws about meaning, is not my style of work. I cannot think of anywhere in my work where I have a theory of meaning, even in more general discussions such as Thick Description (Geertz 1993: 6-10). I am not even sure of what a theory of meaning would be. However, my work is certainly based on different concep tions of, for instance symbols, reference etc., which go back to the semiotic or semantic tradition. I have not contributed to the discus sion of a general theory of meaning. Of course, I have learned from Gottlob Frege, but I do not do that kind of thing. I learn from others and try to use it. Micheelsen: In relationship to this, you state that your view of culture is essentially a semiotic one, which can be viewed as clusters of signs (or symbols), and that the means for unpacking the inherent meaning in such symbolic systems is through thick description (Geertz 1993: 5, 6, 14). Furthermore, you state that:</page><page sequence="6">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ Such an approach is neither introspectionist nor behaviorist; it is se mantic. It is concerned with the collectively created patterns of meaning the individual uses to give form to experience and point to action, with conceptions embodied in symbols and clusters of symbols, and with the directive force of such conceptions in public and private life. (Geertz 1970: 95-96) On the other hand, you use terminology from the semiological tradition in Mean ing and Order in Moroccan Society (Geertz et al. 1979: 200-201). Do you understand interpretive anthropology as a semiotic enterprise? Geertz: Well, semiotics is of course not just one thing, but I do agree that I am interested in meaning and symbols, and in that sense one can understand my work as semiotic, though without a general theory of meaning. Ferdinand de Saussure and the structuralism that followed in his steps is not the approach I use. Of course, I have learned from Saussure—no one can ignore him—but as I have al ready said: As I am not interested in a separate science of phenom enology, I am not interested in a separate science of semiotics. The other tradition is Charles S. Peirce, who is, in his phenomenological approach, too much a realist for me. But I am more in the Peircean tradition. However, semiotics as a formal, scientific, abstract, ob jectivistic discipline is not the way I go (Geertz 1983: 120). So, when I say semiotics, I do mean in the sense of the general conception of the function of sign or symbol. Nevertheless, it is the pragmatic tradi tion and the phenomenological conceptual tradition which I feel myself more comfortable with. Again, semiotics as quasi-logical, quasi-formal discipline is not for me. Micheelsen: Umberto Eco has, in my view, tried to bridge the two traditions, i.e., Saussure and Peirce, and he—as you do—places the sign within the bounda ries of culture (Eco 1976: 66). Have you been inspired by his work? Geertz: I have read some of Eco's work. I have not been deeply influenced by him—not because I do not like his work. I just have not read that much of him. He tends to be, like me, a little bit of an essayist. I like what he has to say about interpretation, but then again, I tend to be an anti-structuralist, which means that I have stayed clear of his more formalistic work. Micheelsen: If you say that you to some degree do semiotics, why do you call it symbols and not signs, i.e., use different terminology? Geertz: Well, that distinction comes out of Susanne Langer (Geertz 1993: 100; Langer 49: 60-61). I do not really care about the terms. I am willing to use the term sign, as long as it is understood that a sign</page><page sequence="7">0 ARUN MICHEELSEN is conceptual and not a signal (Langer 1962: 54-65). In this sense, a dark cloud is a sign of rain, but it is not a symbol of rain, except in somebody's poem (Geertz 1993: 91). I have no objections to the term signs, as long as it is understood in the Peircean way and not in a Saussurean way. There is a difference between an index, an icon, and a symbol. Micheeisen: Which means that you hold on to the idea of the sign hewing a reference? Geertz: Yes—the sign is about something, which is a better formu lation than "a reference". Signs in the Peircean sense have an aboutness (Langer 1962: 112, 147). Therefore, when I use the term symbol in my work, it is to be understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes symbolical via a cultural interpretation. Dogs cannot, in my view, respond to symbols. They can only re spond to signs. The famous example is from Langer, where she tells of a person who comes into a room where there is a dog. The person said the master's name—for example, "James"—and the dog re sponded by looking for James. If you do the same to a human, the person would properly respond with: "What about James"? (Langer 1962: 149). You see, there is an "aboutness". That is the distinction 1 want to hold on to. Micheeisen: If we look at the critique you have encountered, then reservations against interpretive anthropology as a program have been raised by Paul Shankman (Shankman 1984), because of the general particularity of interpretive anthropol ogy, its concept of "Cultural analysis [as] intrinsically incomplete" (Geertz 1993: 29), and with the practical method of "guessing at meaning assessing the guesses, and drawing explanatory conclusions from the better guesses " (Geertz 1993: 20). Furthermore, Talal Asad has focused on the construction of meaning and power from a historical and institutional perspective, which is a subject he feels you fail to attend to in your work (Asad 1983). How do you respond to this? Geertz: Well, I do not agree with their critique. If I did, I would change what I am doing. Shankman has a very superficial under standing of what interpretation is. He talks about Wilhelm Dilthey, but he does not really know what went on in that tradition. When Shankman gave his critique, Dilthey was not translated into English, and I doubt that he has read him in German. Therefore, I must admit that I have not given much attention to his critique. Asad is a more significant figure, and here I think there is a real disagreement. I think I have used a historical constitutional framework in my work, which he says I have not. To be honest, I think he is a power</page><page sequence="8">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 9 reductionist. He thinks that it is power that really matters and not belief. His notion of definition and his following critique just ignores what I was doing (Asad 1993: 29). I suspect Asad is a Marxist who cannot be material-reductionist anymore, so instead he is a power reductionist. Micheelsen: Do you, in opposition to Asad, view meaning as being before power? Geertz: No. I just do not think that power has any independent existence outside of a cultural or historical context. Moreover, I think there is a tendency nowadays to view human phenomena as a power struggle. From that perspective, any kind of meaning is a cover for a power struggle. Nevertheless, to say that meaning is before power would make me a meaning realist and idealist, which I am not. I just do not think that all significance comes down to the distribution of power. Micheelsen: Although you say that "you do not do systems" (Geertz 2000: x),you refer to art, ideology, common sense, and religion as systems (Geertz 1983; Geertz 1993). How is this to be understood? Geertz: Well, I think I do not do systems, but that is a fair question. The terms were just titles. When you read my analysis of art, religion, etc., it is not that systematic. I just said that there is some kind of internal coherence, and one should look at them in a contextual way. That is as far as I went with system analysis, and I do not use that title anymore. However, it is Parsons' influence—who ended up viewing culture as a pure system (Parsons 1937: 762-763)—that can be seen here. But I do not view culture like that. The title is just an attempt to realize Parsons' program of cultural systems, which I still would do, i.e., try to show systematic relationships (Parsons 1951). However, the systematic relationships are to be found in that which one is studying, not formulated before the analysis via a general philosophy or a general theory. I do not formulate general theories about anything! Micheelsen: But what about philosophical standpoints before one starts to study culture? Geertz: Well, first of all, before is not the right word. It is always already. One always has a perspective when one starts. In my case, before anthropology it was philosophy and literature. At that time, I was interested in ideas and society or practice—which is still my main interest. When I started to study anthropology, I tried to see the same relation in terms of culture and structure/practice. Then later</page><page sequence="9">10 ARUN MICHEELSEN in the Wittgenstein tradition via action and so on. So you are right, one always starts somewhere. Except it is not that one starts with a philosophical position and then changes it when confronted by facts. You start with a generalized take on the world, and as an anthropolo gist, it is within a professional context. But then again, I think that even though I have developed my views through time, they are still recognizable with what I started out with. Micheelsen: But doesn't that which you produce when writing your books or when you go into thefield and analyze have to have some kind ofi independent value or some relevance? Geertz: Yes, things that were obscure and confused are clear when you can understand them. The cockfight is a good example (Geertz 1993: 412-453). When I first observed the cockfight, I had no idea at all of what was going on. If you have seen one cockfight you have seen them all, but the Balinese were passionate about them, and I could not figure out why. Hence, I tried to clarify what was going on because I did not understand it. A pure description might point toward gambling, but it was clearly more than that. What I wanted to do was to understand or clarify the fight, to understand how the participators might understand it and, at the same time, try to show how such an analysis should be done. The cockfight analysis is thus a model or an example of how to do this kind of work. You try to make sense of it, i.e., make sense that they make of it. Try to understand how they make sense of their world. In that way, it is phenomeno logical and hermeneutic. It is an attempt to understand things from the native's point of view. Nevertheless, it is on our terms, i.e., the observer's. Micheelsen: Should one then, afier the analysis, go back to the natives and show them ones results? Geertz: In general, no! When it comes to the cockfights, it is more difficult. I tried to do that, but the cockfight is based on an illusion, so they do not want to understand it. If they did, it would not work. Sometimes people have a natural resistance to understand what they are doing. On the other hand, I did go back and talked with them about what they were doing, but they are not interested in social science or alternative understandings/interpretations of what they are doing. They are not interested in the hermeneutics of cockfights. They already know what it means to them. What I want to do is tell somebody, who does not already know what the cockfight means, what it means.</page><page sequence="10">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 1 1 Micheelsen: Is what you are doing also from a psychological perspective then? Geertz: Well, there are some psychological dimensions in my work, but I do not do psychology. Micheelsen: If we turn to your view of the religious perspective, then you say in Islam Observed: We look not for a universal property—"sacredness" or "belief in the supernatural," for example—that divides religious phenomena off from nonreligious ones with Cartesian sharpness, but for a system of concepts that can sum up a set of inexact similarities, which are yet genuine similarities, we sense to inhere in a given body of material. We are attempting to articulate a way of looking at the world, not to describe an unusual object. ... The heart of this way of looking at the world, that is, of the religious perspective, is ... the conviction that the values one holds are grounded in the inherent structure of reality, that between the way one ought to live and the way things really are there is an unbreak able inner connection. What sacred symbols do for those to whom they are sacred is to formulate an image of the world's construction and a program for human conduct that are mere reflections of one another. (Geertz 1970: 96-97) This seems to exclude anthropomorphism, which is evident in your definition of religion (Geertz 1993: 90). Why do you choose this perspective on the phenomena and study of religion, and how, in this context, are we to understand sacred symbols if we are not to talk about "sacredness"? Geertz: Doing that, i.e., giving an essentialistic definition of religion, is what Asad is accusing me of doing, which he then says is really a Christian view of religion, and therefore unusable (Asad 1993). That is not what I am doing, but that is what I am accused of. I am more empirically focused, and if one starts out with the concept of "sa cred", I do not think that that will hold up empirically. I do not think that belief in the supernatural is necessarily a part of religion—early Buddhism would not be a religion in that sense. One can do that, i.e., make the concept of the supernatural a part of religion, but I think that one will eliminate many things. In addition to this, I think that the concept of the supernatural is a Western idea. Even cultures or societies who believe in spirits—as the Native American Indians do— do not in that sense view them as being supernatural, and therefore do not divide the world into a natural and supernatural world. I am at least open to the possibility that they do not. Therefore, I do not want to make an essentialistic definition of religion. Micheelsen: Armin Geertz suggests the concept of 'transempirical' in his definition (A.W. Geertz 1999: 471).</page><page sequence="11">12 ARUN MICHEELSEN Geertz: Yes, and I do like Armin Geertz's work, but even that seems to assume that people are distinguishing between the empirical and the trans-empirical. I think—to some degree—that the dichotomist view, i.e., sacred/profane, supernatural/natural, or trans-empirical/ empirical, is a Western notion, which is not necessarily true in all cases. I am not on a crusade about it; I am just skeptical about it. In most cases, the religious person would understand his or her religious beliefs as being natural, or what we might view as being supernatural as being natural—of course insofar as the person has a notion of natural and supernatural. In relation to this, I have had my problems with Melford Spiro (Spiro 1968: 91, 96). Micheelsen: Is it because you want to be as close to the data as possible? Geertz: I would not say I am closer to the data than Armin Geertz, who is an extraordinary researcher. I just want to be open and re sponsive to it—to go where it goes, rather than where I want it to go. I do not want to put ideas in people's heads, if they are not in there, such as distinguishing between the natural and the supernatural, un less that is what comes out of what they are doing. Micheelsen: I see that we cannot stay clear of the discussion of what science is. Armin Geertz tries to formulate in his work a scientific standpoint for studying religion, if we want to call it a science (A. W. Geertz 1999: 446-447). Geertz: Yes, I tend not to do that. The model for science is essen tially taken from the natural sciences, which goes back to Edward Tylor. And that tends to make people look for laws and abstract regularities—which again goes back to Wissenschafi—which do not apply in Geistesiuissenschaft. I do not make that distinction that sharp either. I think that the attempts to highly scientize social science, from behaviorism in the 1920s to social biology today, are destructive of what I want to do in the social sciences, which is to help people understand one another.3 I do not care if you call it science or social science, as long one does not understand science in a positivistic way. Micheelsen: But there are theories of interpretation and therefore limits or boundaries for interpretation as a perspective. Geertz: Yes, I am not saying that one should not think. I just do not think that the natural science model should be applied uncritically in the social sciences. I am not against reason or even science with a small "s". 3 "Looked at in this way, the aim of anthropology is the enlargement of the universe of human discourse" (Geertz 1993: 14).</page><page sequence="12">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 13 Micheelsen: With the eradication of private language via Wittgenstein, the focus on the evolution of the human mind as parallel with the evolution of culture, and the notion of cultural systems as guides for human perception, what is your opinion on cognitive science in general and the "second cognitive revolution", i.e., Mark Turner, George Lakoff, Jerome Bruner, and Umberto Eco for that matter (Geertz 1963: 67; Geertz 1993: 12, 55-83, 216).» Geertz: Bruner claims not to be a cognitivist anymore. Again, what happened to cognitive sciences, after the cognitive revolution, was that it became subject to the natural sciences model, i.e., AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Chomskyism, which became what I would call a kind of super-science. I think that the "second cognitive revolution", in so far that there is one—although I find the idea interesting—is more what Bruner would call cultural psychology, like Turner and Lakoff. I think that they are going in the right direction, because they are opposed to the highly formalized cognitive tradition which came out of Noam Chomsky. Turner and LakofFs work is interesting, but it does seem a bit redundant. In my own work, I talk about the evolution of the brain and the growth of culture, not the evolution of culture (Geertz 1993: 55). I do not believe in cultural evolution— culture changes and grows, and maybe by some standard, it evolves. I do believe that culture is involved in our brain's evolution. How ever, culture does not evolve in the Darwinian sense. Micheelsen: Finally, I would like to ask you what interpretive anthropology's potential development in the new millennium is, especially in regard to the postmodern paradigm. Geertz: I think that postmodernism is past its sale date. It is not irrelevant, it had tremendous critical importance. However, as a pat tern for future development I think it is a dead end. I think we should listen and learn from them and then move along. They have with their critique helped to clarify some of our fundamental concepts, such as culture or interpretation, but they will not last as a program in themselves. And that, the clarification and critique, changed the direction of anthropology. Therefore, my way of interpretive anthro pology will go on much chastened by this. We will no longer have a simple-minded notion of what interpretation is; we are now aware of the problem of meaning-realism, and so forth. All this is terribly important. Personally, they influence me, and to some degree, I am 4 See Bruner 1983, 1993; Eco 2000; Turner 1987, 1998; Lakoff and Johnson 1981; Lakoff and Turner 1989.</page><page sequence="13">14 ARUN MICHEELSEN still a part of it. As for cultural anthropology, it will in my view go on in reasonable continuity with its past. Micheelsen: But do you think that interpretive anthropology might get more systematic through time? Geertz: I think that disciplines tend to move in a rhythm where it becomes more systematic until it becomes a straitjacket, and then people move in different directions and break it apart. I do not think that a simple linear movement toward systematization is in store for interpretive anthropology, though I think some parts of it will be come more systematic and taken for granted. It is almost a dialectic movement between systematization and renewal. But then again, I cannot predict the future! Closing comments As we have seen, it is Geertz's opinion that the systematic relation ships are to be found in that which one is studying, not formulated before the analysis by means of a general philosophy or a general theory—and therefore one shoùld be careful of formulating any theory at all. In other words, it is to some extent his opinion that theory in itself can spawn its own imaginary systems. But what do those of us who study religion do when we do systems to some degree, i.e., when we identify systematic relationships in that which we are studying, in co-operation with theory? Can we, like Geertz, survive with only a conceptual frame as our life-jacket, or do we need something more? I fully agree with Geertz, that "[ajnthropologists don't study villages (tribes, towns, neighborhoods ... ); they study in villages" (Geertz 1993: 22). However, should we not have something more than a pragmatically-applied phenomenological and herme neutical method—a method, to be sure, without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture—before we plunge into the sea of human culture? "The understanding of understanding", which Geertz calls cul tural henneneutics, is possible because of his conceptual framework —comprised of individual concepts that all have their own discipli nary story to tell—and the acceptance of the observer's participation in the enterprise of interpretation via the "thick description" method in itself (Geertz 1983: 5). Therefore, the question is if one should deny the disciplinary autonomy Geertz applies, or if one should rec</page><page sequence="14">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 15 ognize the usefulness, and possible necessity, of an explicated inter pretive theory, so that we know how we and others like us experience these understandings. There might after all be systematic relation ships in "the way we think now", and in relationship to this some general assumptions may need to be identified (Geertz 1983: 147-163). If meanings are not out there to be studied, then assuredly symbols are. Therefore, we should concentrate on them and their relation ships in order to clarify Geertz's concept of interpretation and method, i.e., the relationship between our conceptual frame, the life in the "village", the observer, and the unavoidable a priori assump tions that are present. The starting point thus is Geertz's definition of the symbol. As we have seen, Geertz understands symbols in the tradition of Langer and Peirce (and, as already mentioned, Peirce understood the symbol as a subclass of the sign). With the help of an applied phenomenology and an applied hermeneutic method, Geertz has a perspective that can clarify the fundamental mechanisms of the creation and communica tion of meaning within a culture (Geertz 1966: 67; Geertz 1993: 98, 215-220; Geertz 1995: 114). The symbol is thus a relational entity in which meaning, understood as a public phenomenon, is suspended. It is suspended in the sense that the symbol is comprised of three elements: the representamen (the tangible side of the symbol), the object (that which the symbol refers to), and the interprétant (which is the relation between the representamen and the object) (Peirce 1955: 98-119). This means that meaning is not "stored" in symbols or outside our cultures, as a free-floating phenomenon (Geertz 1993: 127). In this perspective meanings are a matter of the relation be tween human beings, their natural and cultural environment, and the symbols' "aboutness". If this is the way we humans perceive ourselves and our surroundings—at least some of us hope so—then meaning is not only an internal matter (i.e., a purely singular and/or a general mental mechanism or process), but a partially open and explicated process which involves natural and cultural objects and the ongoing process of action via the symbols, i.e., symbolization. Consequently, it should be stressed that although the symbol is a pragmatic tool for any analysis (which to some degree enables us to convey specific cultural meanings from one system to our academic elaboration and explication of the same meaning—and in that process clarify how this is done), the symbol is already a theoretically formulated concept</page><page sequence="15">16 ARUN MICHEELSEN and is therefore not in direct contact with the data that one wishes to analyze. Thus when in use, the symbol as an analytical concept is already coming from a specific perspective. The abstraction, however, does not stop here, for within any cul tural matrix the symbols can have, or be given, a systematic relation ship, which again can be assimilated by the inhabitants of that cul ture (Geertz 1993: 83). The systems, still understood as systematic relationships, can be distinguished as art, common sense, religion, ideology, etc., and are therefore at a more basic analytical level than the concept of symbol (Geertz 1983: 73, 94; Geertz 1993: 129, 193, 230). The systems can be defined—as Geertz did so many years ago with religion—as a guide for a new orientation for our research, and new analytical concepts attached to the system can be introduced, such as ethos and worldview (Geertz 1993: 87-141). Furthermore, the generalization does not end here, for these systems can interact with each other, such as common sense and religion do (Geertz 1970: 95). Although the interactions are culture-specific, they are still general relations between systems in all cultures. In that sense, science and common sense are also related to each other (Geertz 1970: 94-95; 1993: 111-113). It is here that we begin to glimpse the general within Geertz's thinking, i.e., the concept of symbols and their systematic relationships in any culture. However, we seldom analyze (or interpret) religion as a phenom enon sui generis, but rather as a model for interpretation, i.e., we interpret interpretations. Geertz, with his concept of "model of' and "model for" has stressed the interpretive function of religion for the believer (Geertz 1993: 93, 118). Nevertheless., this changes several things, for we now have to clarify what it is we wish to study. Is it our task to study what a religion means, or is it our task to study how religion generates and articulates meaning? It is my view that Geertz is concerned with both issues, which is why he applies and combines a phenomenological and hermeneutical perspective. If this is the case, then the specific what and the general how is combined in Geertz's method and therefore one cannot do without the other. The question is: what is the general, and in which way is it related to the concept of symbol, culture, or even one's general assumptions? Does Geertz's interpretive anthropology then constitute an inter pretive theory? This certainly depends on what is meant by theory. With his conceptual frame, including all the assumptions in each concept (for instance, symbol), his pragmatically-applied phenomen</page><page sequence="16">AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ 17 ological and hermeneutical method, which has the capacity to pen etrate and explicate cultures, and his unavoidable axiomatic base structure, he does have a theory in a restricted sense. It may be an open theory because of the bottomless quality of cultures and the refusal to formulate any general regularities or abstract laws (Geertz 1993: 26, 29). However, the abstraction is already there in his con cepts and method, even though the hermeneutics is never-ending. Nevertheless, even though our academic life-world may be subject to the same inquiry as any cultural phenomena are, it is a life-world that is constructed on the basis of inquiry both toward itself and our subject matter (Geertz 1993: 230-233). It is ideological and scientific in the sense that it wishes to understand the world, communicate that new understanding, and does all of this by following—critically—a distinct method. By critically I mean, on the one hand, that we accept the history of our concepts and, on the other hand, that we constantly and explicitly reformulate our concepts and working method in relationship to whatever we are dealing with at the mo ment. However, our analytical concepts are not isolated entities which we can use eclectically, but are part of a tradition, and an even larger theory. They might, when we single them out, have the same focal point, but eventually they are selected in relationship to their analytical relevance. Furthermore, in each specific perspective, the base axiomatic structure and the conceptual frame defines what can be understood as relevant for the analysis at hand and how to analyze the subject matter. The perspective and analysis that follows from the perspective have assumptions after all, like our common sense. Geertz may with good reason formulate this as "always al ready", but it is my conviction that an explicated theory of interpre tation could explicate those assumptions. Which consequences does this have for the study of religion and the understanding of Geertz? To some degree, there are none. Geertz's opinions can easily be found in his own work. However, his own clarification of his definition of the symbol can be of some help. Because culture, common sense, art, religion, law, etc., are symbolic systems, and because we humans not only think, but also perceive and act via symbolic systems, the overall understanding of the symbol has tremendous importance for the understanding of Geertz's re search. The symbol as a key concept establishes the general outlook and limit for observation, interpretation, and overall understanding of the human species. In other words, the symbol, and that which</page><page sequence="17">18 ARUN MICHEELSEN constitutes it, is on one level that which enables our species to think, act, and reflect. On another level, the symbol is that which we pro duce and which influences us, i.e., cultural systems. Finally, it is the tool for our investigation of others and our own life-world through a hermeneutical and phenomenological perspective. In this sense, the limit of interpretation is "always already" drawn by the definition of the symbol. If the definition of the symbol is, as I am claiming, one model or perspective among others, then we could do well with a general argumentation and investigation of the validity of this model in rela tionship to what we are studying—humans, cultures, religions, etc.— in order to separate and understand the specific what and the general how. In many respects, Geertz has done that. His essay on common sense as a cultural system is, in my opinion, a good example of exactly that (Geertz 1983: 73-93). However, his efforts have inten tionally never produced any general conclusions, except maybe one: "If you want a good rule-of-thumb generalization from anthropology, I would suggest the following: Any sentence that begins, 'All societies have ...'is either baseless or banal" (Geertz 2000: 135). And right he is. But it is of some interest that one can conclude just that—that is, that one can formulate the relative in an absolute manner and vice versa. I neither can nor will draw any final conclusions on this matter. Instead I will let Geertz have—almost have—the last word: What we need are ways of thinking that are responsive to particularities, to individualities, oddities, discontinuities, contrasts, and singularities, responsive to what Charles Taylor has called "deep diversity," a plural ity of ways of belonging and being, and that yet can draw from them— from it—a sense of connectedness, a connectedness that is neither com prehensive nor uniform, primal nor changeless, but nonetheless real. (Geertz 2000: 224) It is my opinion that Geertz's unique method has the capacity of exactly that, i.e., of grasping the culturally specific in a general way.
