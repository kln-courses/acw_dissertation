(Retired) ABSTRACT Hyge sled tests were conducted using a rear-seat sled fixture to evaluate submarining responses (the lap belt of a lap-shoulder belt restraint loads the abdominal region instead of the pelvis). Objectives of these tests included: an evaluation of methods to determine the occurrence of submarining; an investigation into the influence of restraint system parameters, test severity, and type of anthropomorphic test device on submarining response; and an exploration of the mechanics of submarining. This investigation determined that: 1 . Slippage of the lap belt off the pelvis due to dynamic loading of the dummy and the resulting kinematics can cause abdominal loading to the dummy in laboratory crash testing. 2. The 5th female dummy submarined more easily than did the Hybrid III in the test environment. 3. Motion of the pelvis was controlled using a "pelvic stop", which reduced the submarining tendency for both the 5th female and Hybrid III dummies. 4. Shortening the buckle strap length (in conjunction with a pelvic stop) increased the submarining "threshold". 5. Modifying the belt restraint by removing the retractor from the lap-belt and adding a retractor to the shoulder belt (with the standard seat) increased the "threshold" severity for submarining. 6. The occurrence of the belt slipping off the pelvis and loading the abdomen was well correlated to rearward rotation of the pelvis. 7. In addition to standard film analysis, detection of the belt slipping off the pelvis is strongly enhanced by use of a submarining indicating pelvis, pelvic in-line accelerometry, and belt force transducers. 8. The development of a method to unequivocally detect the occurrence of submarining, and to predict the severity of any resulting injury would greatly strengthen the analysis of restraint performance. LABORATORY TESTING OF BELT-RESTRAINT systems may result in submarining. This involves the belt slipping off the dummy pelvis and directly loading the abdominal region. There are many issues related to assessing belt restraint performance associated with direct abdominal loading. One group of these issues is directed toward field relevance, another is directed toward laboratory assessment of submarining, and still another is directed toward development of counter-measures to prevent abdominal loading for a range of occupant sizes, seating positions, and crash severities. Field relevance includes such considerations as: the frequency and severity of abdominal injuries due to belt loading observed in the field; and differences between laboratory and field conditions that might influence interpretation of the test results or the setting of performance goals (e.g., clothing, impact configuration and severity, occupant characteristics, etc.) [1-8]. Considerations in laboratory assessment include: the biofidelity of dummy response; the risk of Injury If direct abdominal loading by the belt restraint does occur; as well as the differences between laboratory and field conditions (e.g., adjustment and placement of the belt-restraint, occupant initial posture, etc.) [1-8]. Various methods have been developed to detect motion of a lap belt past the anterior superior iliac spines of the pelvis in laboratory tests. The traditional method has been to review high speed movies. But, such reviews are subjective in nature and might not have sufficient visibility on which to base judgments (due to obscuration by other dummies, intervening doors or panels, or by loose clothing on the dummy, etc.). Several approaches have been proposed which utilize instrumentation in the dummy to measure belt loading, either as the belt slides over the iliac spines or after it slips off the iliac spines and loads the abdomen. Studies of the tendency of the belt to slip off the dummy pelvis In laboratory tests have demonstrated that at least five groups of parameters can influence submarining: 1) the belt restraints; 2) the vehicle environment; 3) the exposure severity; 4) the characteristics of the dummy; and 5) the test setup 1810</page><page sequence="2">parameters such as dummy positioning or belt adjustments. A variety of recommendations exist in the literature which propose system configurations that may reduce the tendency for the belt to slip off the pelvis, and which demonstrate that in addition to the various belt restraint characteristics, other vehicle structures can also be a primary factor in providing restraint [9-14]. Various studies [10-14] have also recommended a kinematic analysis of the dummy motions to better assess the restraint performance. METHODOLOGY Hyge sled tests were conducted with a rear-seat buck having reinforced belt anchors. The "baseline" configuration consisted of a bench seat and an add-on shoulder belt to a rear-seat lap-belt restraint. The upper anchor of the shoulder belt was shelf-mounted directly behind the shoulder and did not have a retractor. Thus the shoulder belt was shorter and had less potential elongation than typical for front seat applications. The lap- belt had a retractor at the out-board anchor location. The buckle strap extended from the junction of the seat cushions. All anchors were reinforced and rigid. Various modifications of the restraint system were made. A Styrofoam pelvic stop was used to reduce the tendency of the dummy to submarine. The stop had to be tightly coupled to the floor-pan to prevent large forward displacements of the pelvis. An alternative pelvic stop was constructed of wood, which was also tightly coupled to the floor pan. Modifications of the belt restraint were also tested. The buckle strap was shortened so that the buckle was at the junction of the seat pan and seat back and not near the pelvic anterior iliac spine. A retractor was added at the shoulder-belt anchor and removed from the lap-belt to reduce the excursion of the pelvis and increase the forward bending of the upper torso as per Adomeit's kinematic criteria [10-12]. While the aim of these modifications was to improve restraint system performance, they did not comprehend other issues such as comfort and convenience. A generic sled acceleration characteristic was used for these tests and did not model any particular vehicle nor some aspects of car crashes such as pitch. Tests were conducted at several severities to determine the submarining threshold for this test environment. A typical pulse is shown in Figure 1 . High speed movies were taken of all but the last four tests and included: an offboard wide-angle view, an onboard view of the inboard side of the dummy, and an offboard view of the outboard side of the dummy. In the last four tests the wide-angle view was replaced with an onboard view of the outboard side. A Hybrid III dummy and a 5th percentile female dummy were used in these tests. The Hybrid III dummy had more instrumentation than the 5th female dummy (Table 1). The pelvic rotation instrumentation consisted of 5 in-line accelerometers, Figure 2, and used the analysis from Ref [15]. The Hybrid III was equipped with a load-bolt pelvis [16] which provided an indication of belt slip over the anterior superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each iliac spine of the load-bolt pelvis has three load transducers, situated vertically to indicate the superior/inferior location of the belt load, Figure 3. During the test, the pelvis rotates rearward and the belt load shifts from the lower load bolts to the higher load bolts. At the time of submarining, as the lap-belt slips over the anterior-superior iliac spine, the upper bolts suddenly unload. Note that the load bolts would not detect a belt placed directly on the abdomen (i.e., a misplaced belt). The forces in the shoulder and lap belts were recorded during these tests using GSE Model 2500 Seat Belt Force Sensors. The shoulder belt load cell was positioned on the outboard side of the dummy between the shoulder and the anchor or retractor. The lap belt load cell was placed on the inboard side of the dummy between the buckle and the seat back. Previous studies [13,14] have demonstrated that submarining is associated with rearward rotation of the pelvis (the iliac crests move in a posterior direction relative to the pubic rami). If sufficient, this rearward rotation allows "unhooking" of the lap-belt from the pelvic iliac spines. (Also involved, but to a lesser extent, is the decreasing lap-belt angle caused by the the forward and downward translation of the pelvis.) Because of the rear- seat environment, the test movies could not be used to determine changes in lap-belt angle for many of the tests. However, rotation of the pelvis could be determined using an' array of accelerometers known as an in-line array. The in-line array takes advantage of the measurable difference in the accelerations experienced by accelerometers mounted along a line, and constrained to rotate as a unit. The information in these accelerations can be used to obtain rotational: acceleration, velocity, and displacement. A least squares fit of these parameters through the five accelerometers gives accurate results. [15] RESULTS The test matrix is provided in Table 2 and includes occurrence of submarining. In tests where the belt slipped off the pelvis on one side only, it was always on the buckle strap (inboard) side. SUBMARINING THRESHOLD/BASELINE SYSTEMS - The Hybrid III dummy had a submarining threshold of about 42 km/h in the sled tests using the conventional seat and "add-on" shoulder belt. For test severities slightly greater than the submarining threshold severity, the belt slipped over the pelvic iliac spine only on the buckle-strap side - likely due to lifting of the lap-belt by the shoulder-belt. The 5th female dummy submarined on both sides of the pelvis at all severities tested, indicating that the submarining threshold for the baseline system is less than 35 km/h. Thus the 5th female dummy tendency to submarine is greater in this environment than that of the Hybrid III dummy. SUBMARINING THRESHOLD/MODIFIED SYSTEMS - Hardware modifications influence the submarining threshold. Use of the pelvic stop, or the modified belt restraint raised the submarining threshold from about 42 km/h to greater than 52 km/h for the Hybrid III dummy. 1811</page><page sequence="3">TYPICAL 8LED ACCELERATION PULSE ^ Accélération (g) ÍT' ^ -6 4 1 , , O BO 100 160 200 Tim« (ma) Figure 1 .

Because submarining occurred only on the buckle-strap side, 53 km/h must be slightly above the submarining threshold. Thus, for the 5th female dummy, the pelvic stop increased the submarining threshold from below 35 km/h to almost 53 km/h. Tests with the pelvic stop and a shortened buckle-strap increased the submarining threshold to greater than 56 km/h for the 5th female dummy. SUBMARINING DETERMINATION - The occurrence of submarining for the Hybrid III dummy was determined independently, and blindly (the test number was not known when the interpretation of the data was made) through analysis of the high speed movies, load bolt data, belt load data, and the pelvic in-line acceleration data. A summary of the results of the individual determinations follows, with a comparison of the various methods in the discussion section. FILM ANALYSIS - The pelvic angular displacement, the occurrence of submarining, and frame in which it occurred were recorded during film analysis. Table 3 lists the results for each test. Submarining occurred in tests 1 , 3, 4, and 6. There was no submarining in any other test (n.b., the lap belts were severed by the photographic targets in tests 2 and 9, which limited the amount of information obtained from those tests). Because of inadequacies inherent in filming with fixed cameras, it was very difficult to determine whether submarining had occurred on the outboard side in test 4, and whether It occurred on either side in test 8. LOAD-BOLT PELVIS - The criterion used to determine whether or not submarining had occurred was the shape of the load time curves examined as a whole and individually, Figure 4. The combination of factors assumed to indicate submarining was asymmetry in the curves which normally approximate bell shapes, rapid unloading of the belt, and shifting of the load from the inferior to the superior load bolts (Because the belt is wider than the inter-bolt spaces, there were usually forces on two bolts recorded simultaneously). Table 4 displays the determination of the occurrence of submarining using the load-bolt data. In some tests, absolute determination of the occurrence or non- occurrence of submarining was not possible. These included test 6 where a determination could not be made on the outboard side, and test 8 where the clothing of the dummy made it very difficult to be sure. BELT LOADS - The criterion used to judge the occurrence of submarining for the belt load data was similar to that for the load bolt data, viz. asymmetry of the force-time curves. The belt load curves are very similar to bell shaped curves when the dummy kinematics yield no submarining. Therefore, rapid unloading of the belts, and/or multiple peaks or deviations from the bell shape were assumed to indicate the occurrence of submarining, Figure 5. The results of the belt load data analysis are presented in Table 5. PELVIS ANGULAR RESPONSES - Table 6 indicates the maximum rearward pelvis rotation associated with the Hybrid III tests. A logistic regression analysis was performed on the pelvic rotation data using submarining as the dependent variable. The amount of pelvic rotation was analyzed by itself and in combination with the belt loads as independent parameters. The results have been graphed in Figure 6. The best fit occurred with the single parameter regression on pelvic rotation, which yielded a X = 8.88, r = .655, and p = 0.0029. The ED50 for the occurrence of submarining is at 28.0° for these tests. Examination of the pelvic rotation graphs for the tests in which submarining occurred shows that all curves have a common feature that is not present in the curves for tests with no submarining, Figures 7,8. In each graph of a test in which submarining occurred, there is a discontinuity in the displacement versus time curve. For simplicity if one fits a line to the rising portion of the curve, the slope changes abruptly at some point in the curve of all the tests in which submarining occurred. Further examination shows that in 3 out of the 4 tests the change in slope took place at or near the angle of the pelvis at which submarining occurred as determined in the film analysis, Table 7). DISCUSSION These experiments suggest that shoulder and lap belt loads, the load-bolt pelvis, and in-line pelvic accelerometry can each provide indications of lap-belt slippage over the pelvic iliac spines and could provide an objective indication of submarining for many situations. Even when all methods are used (see Table 8), in any particular test there can still be some uncertainty as to the occurrence or non-occurrence of submarining. The errors made fall into the following 3 categories: (I) False Positives, which occur when interpretation of the transducer output indicates that submarining has •occurred but, in actuality, it has not. • The load bolts and belt loads gave false positives when the pelvic angle photographic target cut through the belt. (II) Unknowns, which occur when interpretation of the transducer output does not unequivocally indicate whether submarining has occurred. • The film analysis resulted In unknown determination of outboard submarining when the view was obscured in test 4. • The belt load data yielded an unknown determination in tests 1 and 8. (III) False Negatives, which occur when interpretation of the transducer output indicates that submarining has not occurred when, in actuality, it has. • The film analysis in test 8 showed no submarining while the load-bolts and in-line accelerometers indicated submarining, and the belt loads indicated a high possibility of submarining. • The in-line data in test 3 indicated no submarining had occurred when in actuality it had. This was probably because the mechanism of submarining was shoulder belt lifting and not pelvic rotation. The belt loads show a high shoulder belt load which peaks before the lap belt load. 1814</page><page sequence="6">TABLE 3 - SUMMARY OF FILM ANALYSIS RESULTS Test Submarined ?

LOAD-BOLT PELVIS - The load-bolt installation and the load transducers change the shape of the iliac spines (Figure 3) and thus could change the "critical" angle, between the lap-belt and pelvis, at which the belt slips off the pelvis. This may introduce a change in the dummy's tendency to submarine. This pelvis also appears to be more sensitive to tears in the simulated flesh covering the iliac spines. However, the load bolt pelvis was as reliable an indicator of submarining as the other instrumentation investigated in this study. IN-LINE ACCELEROMETRY - These results indicate that the belt will slip from the pelvis after approximately 28* of rearward rotation of the pelvis from the 22°-23# initial position (total angle of 50°-51° relative to vertical). Of course this does not allow for changes in the lap-belt angle which increases the tendency to submarine as the pelvis translates forward and downward. On this basis, the 40 km/h test with the standard seat and belt restraint was close to submarining (25° rearward pelvic rotation) as was concluded by the submarining threshold severity analysis. In contrast, in the tests with the pelvic stops, rearward pelvic rotation was reduced to 10.°-11° by providing a force which tended to rotate the pelvis in a direction opposite that of the belt. This aspect of belt restraint systems has been discussed by others [9-14] and is corroborated in this study. THRESHOLD SEVERITY - A "threshold" severity concept for submarining provides a method to compare experimental situations on the basis of submarining tendency. This method has the disadvantage of requiring multiple tests to establish the submarining threshold severity, but could be a powerful tool for some situations. The submarining tendency among types of dummies could be compared by determining the submarining threshold severity for each of the dummies in one or more restraint situations (i.e., the submarining tendency of the Standard vs the Hybrid III version of the 5th percentile female dummy could be effectively determined by this technique). This technique would be effective in comparing the submarining tendency of design modifications of a particular dummy, and could have been used in our study to determine if the load bolt pelvis influenced submarining tendency for restraint configurations similar to that tested. ANALYSIS OF SUBMARINING PERFORMANCE - The analysis of submarining performance can be expanded beyond a yes/no evaluation of submarining. The kinematics of the dummy's pelvis interacting with the belt restraint can be a powerful tool for comparison of submarining performance of prototype systems. The degree of pelvic rotation can be used to estimate how close the exposure came to actual submarining, or how much a system's performance is above the submarining threshold. Other measures of submarining performance can likewise be effective for comparison of submarining tendency among restraint designs or among test dummies. The uncertainty in the determination of the occurrence of submarining shown by the methods evaluated in this study, and the absence of any Information on the significance of the abdominal loading by the belt, underscore the need for an improved and objective method of dealing with lap belt submarining. The development of a method to detect abdominal loading and to predict the severity of any resulting injury would greatly strengthen analysis of restraint performance.
