<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  3   Deep sustainability: ecopoetics, enjoyment  and ecstatic hospitality   Kate  Rigby   Mind the gap!   In 2007 an article appeared in the science journal T rends in Ecology and  Evolution with the witty title, ‘Mind the Sustainability Gap’. Th e gap in  question refers especially to the ecological dimension of the sustainability  agenda and concerns the chasm that continues to yawn ever wider between  ‘what we know needs to be done and what is actually being done’ to avert  catastrophic climatic and environmental change ( Fischer et al.  2007 : 621).  While the authors acknowledge ‘regional-scale improvements in some  indicators of poverty, food supplies and the environment’, they argue that  these are ‘overshadowed by ongoing deterioration of key biophysical  indicators at the global scale’, especially with regard to biodiversity loss  and global warming ( Fischer et al.  2007 : 621). In view of the evident  failure of existing approaches to sustainability to redress such dire threats  to more-than-human life on Earth, Fischer et al. recommend a redirection  of sustainability research, policy and management along two main axes.  Firstly, in place of the conventional ‘triple bottom line’ of environmental,  social and economic sustainability, they favour a ‘hierarchical’ model,  with the ‘biophysical limits of Earth setting the ultimate boundaries within  which social and economic goals must be achieved’ ( Fischer et al.  2007 :  621) Secondly, they argue that closing the sustainability gap necessitates  bridging the disciplinary divide:  Human action in the world emerges from a complex dialectic among  the living world itself, the social contexts of human life and action, and  the conceptualisations through which human life is made meaningful.  Fundamentally enhanced collaboration among natural and social sci- entists and scholars of human contexts, symbols and meanings would  signal the beginning of a new paradigm for addressing the sustainability  gap.  ( Fischer et al.  2007 : 623)   In this chapter, I argue that the twofold renovation of the concept of  sustainability proposed by Fischer et al. invites a deeper questioning of  prevailing cultural assumptions, perceptions and values regarding human  52 </page> <page sequence="2">  Deep sustainability 53 identity, aspirations and interrelations with nonhuman others and our  earthly environs, and I explore the potential contribution of literature to  this cultural work of ‘deep sustainability’.   Th e ‘transdisciplinary’ research programme advocated by Fischer et  al. is modelled by the article itself, which arose from a multi-perspectival  workshop on sustainability hosted by the Australian National University ’ s  Fenner School of Environment and Society. Its seventeen co-authors include  physicists and ecologists, geographers and engineers, agricultural scientists  and conservation biologists, along with the co-founders of Australia ’ s  National Working Group in the Ecological Humanities, which had been  inaugurated at the Australian National University in 2001: historian of  science and environment, Libby Robin, and anthropologist and cultural  theorist, Deborah Bird Rose. Among the other workshop participants  thanked in the acknowledgements was the eminent feminist ecophilosopher,  Val Plumwood, and it is from her paper, ‘Deep Sustainability as Cultural  Work’, that this chapter takes its title. Following Plumwood ’ s death in 2008,  an article partially based on that paper was published in the Ecological  Humanities Corner of the  Australian Humanities Review , under the revised  title ‘Nature in the Active Voice’. Here, Plumwood diff erentiated her depth  model of sustainability from conventional constructions of both ‘deep  ecology’, with its prioritisation of ‘wilderness’ preservation, and ‘shallow  ecology’, with its privileging of exclusively human interests. Instead, she  proposed a ‘mixed framework’ that reveals how ‘human-centredness can  have severe costs for humans as well as non-humans’ ( 2009 : 116). Reject- ing the ‘pernicious false-choice’ of the deep/shallow divide, Plumwood  argues that human-centredness – ‘a complex syndrome which includes  the hyperseparation of humans as a special species and the reduction of  non-humans to their usefulness to humans, or instrumentalism’ – engenders  a hazardous ‘failure to understand our embeddedness in and dependency  on nature [and] distorts our perceptions and enframings in ways that  make us insensitive to limits, dependencies and interconnections of a  non-human kind’ ( 2009 : 116). Accordingly, in her earlier paper, she had  argued that the ‘cultural work of deep sustainability’ entailed the critical  investigation of conceptual frameworks and social systems that occlude  the agency and interests of nonhuman others, along with the ‘ecological  services’, upon which human social and economic sustainability remain  dependent. In ‘Nature in the Active Voice’, she goes on to suggest how  certain forms of writing can help to loosen modern cultures out of the  bonds of human self-enclosure by providing a space for what she calls  an ‘animating sensibility and vocabulary’ ( Plumwood  2009 : 126) that  recognises other-than-human creative agencies, communicative capacities  and ethical considerability. Th is she had previously hailed as a ‘critical  green writing project’ that ‘might make visible whole new interspecies  dialogues, dramas and projects’, and thereby ‘dispel the sado-dispassionate  </page> <page sequence="3"> 54 Discourses of sustainability “imaginary” ... that has supported and nourished the post-enlightenment  illusion of human monopoly of mindful, cultural, intentional elements in  the world’ ( Plumwood  2007 : 19).1    In her workshop paper, Plumwood explicated ‘sustaining’ in line with  earlier ecological feminist articulations of an ethics of fl ourishing (e.g.   Cuomo  1998 ), namely as referring to activities that ‘nourish’ or ‘support’,  thereby ‘contributing to the other ’ s resilience and fl ourishing’ ( Plumwood   2006 : 1). Following this defi nition, an apt emblem for sustainability might  be found in the fi gure of the nest: an avian work of ecopoetics, understood  literally as the making of an  oikos , a place and a practice for bringing new  life into being, which, in its interwoven threads of diverse materials,  reiterates the connective processes that compose fl ourishing ecosystems.  In the latter part of this chapter, I will return to the nest, specifi cally as  it fi gures in the work of the Romantic poet John Clare and is refi gured  in the ecopoetic experimentation of the contemporary writer (and erstwhile  conservation biologist) David Morley.   Th e interpretive frame that I bring to this discussion is informed by  several further lines of theorisation which enrich Plumwood ’ s proposal  for a ‘radical green writing project’: ecophilosopher Freya Mathews ’ s  transpecies ethic of ‘bioproportionality’ (2014), which I relate to Derrida  and Dufourmantelle ’ s notion of ‘radical hospitality’ ( 2000 ), and Mathews ’ s  ‘ontopoetic’ model of the transvaluation of desire ( 2010 ), which I connect  with recent work on ‘alternative hedonism’ by Kate Soper and others  ( Soper et al.  2009 ). While the trajectories of radical hospitality and alterna- tive hedonism are seemingly divergent, with the former presupposing  an altruistic ethic of alterity as opposed to the self-pleasuring implicit  in the latter, I argue that both are necessary to advancing the work of  deep sustainability and can be shown to bear upon one another in the  ecopoetic practices that I discuss here. Firstly, though, it is necessary to  consider more closely the limitations of conventional understandings  of sustainability, in order to explain why, and how, these shortcomings  need to be redressed.   Reframing sustainability: beyond the ‘triple bottom line’   As previously indicated, one of the two major problems with prevailing  models of sustainability research, policy and management identifi ed by  Fischer et al. arises from the construction of sustainability as consisting  of three ‘pillars’. Th is metaphor features infl uentially in the UN General  Assembly ’ s resolution endorsing the outcome of the 2005 summit on  sustainable development, which included the commitment to promoting ‘the  integration of the three components of sustainable development – economic  development, social development and environmental protection – as  </page> <page sequence="4">  Deep sustainability 55 interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars’ ( 2005 : 11–12). While  ‘pillars’ invokes an architectural image in which the removal of any one  support structure would cause the ceiling to collapse, another way of  imaging sustainability along these lines is the Venn diagram, in which  the three dimensions are seen to be distinct, but overlapping at a central  point. Th is has given rise to the popular concept of the ‘triple bottom  line’, which implies, fi rstly, that these are discrete concerns, and secondly,  that there is a parity between them. In much corporate and governmental  practice, this has enabled economic considerations to take precedence,  often primarily in the interests of a privileged minority, moreover, with  matters of social development and environmental protection being  addressed with more or less token measures, if at all. In many cases,  then, the semantically slippery rhetoric of sustainability is deployed with  a view to maintaining capitalist business-as-usual in ‘developed’ nations,  while extending it to ‘developing’ ones. It is for this reason, then, that  Fischer et al. call for the reconceptualisation of the three components as  a hierarchy of considerations, based on the recognition that ‘[s]ocieties  cannot exist without a functioning life-support system, and economics can  only fl ourish within a functioning social system with eff ective institutions  and governance structures’ ( 2007 : 622). In other words, there is only  one bottom line, and it is set by those biophysical processes that have  engendered, and remain crucial to, the diverse more-than-human life of  this planet.   Th is recommendation echoes some earlier formulations of sustainability  (e.g.  Eichler  1999 ) that have since been sidelined, but are now being  rearticulated in relation to the UN ’ s proposed new Sustainable Development  Goals. In a 2013 Comment in  Science , for example, the eminent climate  scientist, Dave Griggs, in company with a group of other researchers  (including Will Steff en, one of the co-authors of  Fischer et al.  2007 ),  proposed a revised model of sustainability based on what they termed a  ‘nested concept’ ( Griggs et al.  2013 : 306). Th is entails an amendment to  the widely accepted defi nition of the UN ’ s 1987 World Commission on  Environment and Development (chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland),  which is verbally modest, but conceptually momentous. Instead of framing  sustainable development as ‘development that meets the needs of the  present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet  their own needs’, the proposed new defi nition refers to ‘development that  meets the needs of the present while safe-guarding Earth ’ s life-support  system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depends’  ( World Commission  1987 : 305).   Th e spur for this crucial redefi nition is the UN policy initiative to  frame a new set of Sustainable Development Goals for the period 2016  to 2030 to replace the Millennium Development Goals following their  expiry at the end of 2015. Griggs and his colleagues are contributing to  </page> <page sequence="5"> 56 Discourses of sustainability this initiative through the transnational  Sustainable Development Solutions  Network Leadership Council  ( 2013 ), which has produced an ‘Action Agenda  for Sustainable Development’ that broadly accords with the ‘nested’  approach. For example, while economic development and ending extreme  poverty remain key priorities, these are now to be achieved in ways that  respect ‘planetary boundaries’ by ensuring environmentally sustainable  production and consumption patterns and helping to stabilise the human  population globally by mid-century. Improvements to agricultural systems,  rural prosperity and urban quality of life are also to be keyed to enhanced  environmental sustainability, which is now understood to include not  only the protection of biodiversity and improved management of water  and other natural resources, but also concerted climate change mitigation  by means of arresting and reversing deforestation, along with a rapid shift  to clean energy production ‘for all’.   In the model presented in S cience , Griggs and his colleagues synthe- sise the ten ‘priority challenges’ identifi ed in the ‘Action Agenda’ into  six over-arching goals – Th riving Lives and Livelihoods; Sustainable  Food Security; Sustainable Water Security; Universal Clean Energy;  Healthy and Productive Ecosystems; and Governance for Sustainable  Societies – each of which cuts across the nested economic, social and  environmental domains. Th is reframing of sustainability poses profound  challenges for ‘developed’ as well as ‘developing’ nations, in addition to  promising to redress the marginalisation of ecological considerations  that has continued largely unabated, despite – perhaps even under  the cover of – the proliferation of the rhetoric of sustainability. In the  encompassing outer circle of Griggs ’ s model, humans and nonhumans  alike fi nd themselves in the same ‘nest’, one that is at once constitutive of,  and constituted by, the Earth ’ s biosphere. Th e precise coordinates of this  meta-nest are provided by the nine ‘planetary boundaries’ identifi ed by  Johan Rockstöm and colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, which  defi ne limits to climate change, biodiversity loss, changes to the nitrogen  and phosphorus cycles, ozone depletion, ocean acidifi cation, freshwater  use, changes to land use (especially the conversion of wildlife habitat to  agricultural or industrial purposes), chemical pollution, and atmospheric  aerosol loading. Forms of economic and social development that transgress  these boundaries, Griggs et al. warn, are liable to cause ‘widespread,  abrupt and possibly irreversible changes to basic Earth-system processes’  ( 2013 : 306).   At this point, however, a further possible pitfall of the sustainability  agenda comes into view: namely that identifi ed by Steve Mentz as a ‘fantasy  about stasis’ ( 2012 : 586). While Mentz ’ s suspicion might hold true of  some popular visions of sustainability, I do not believe that this is implicit  in the notion of planetary boundaries, which presupposes the dynamism  of biophysical systems whilst seeking to conserve the conditions under  </page> <page sequence="6">  Deep sustainability 57 which the ‘discordant harmonies’ ( Botkin  1990 ) discerned by post- equilibrium ecological science might continue to resound on Earth, in  new variations and in new keys, into the future. What is to be sustained,  on this understanding, is not a stable set of entities and relations, then,  but the potential for ongoing or, in sites of pre-existing degradation and  diminishment, renewed more-than-human fl ourishing. Th is in itself  nonetheless implies a transformation of business-as-usual, not only for  environmentally harmful industries, but also for prevailing environmental  practice. For, in light of the new ecology, and in the grip of global warming,  biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration can no longer consist  in the endeavour to maintain species within, or return them to, their  pre-existing geographical bounds: rather, both entail facilitating species’  migration or hybridisation ( Becker et al.  2013 ), as free-living plants and  animals seek to forge their own pathways of survival into an uncertain  future. Under today ’ s intensifying conditions of heightened ‘landscape  fl uidity’, new models of environmental sustainability are needed, such as  the seemingly oxymoronic notion of ‘anticipatory restoration’, as proposed  by Adrian Manning and his colleagues (several of whom also co-authored  ‘Mind the Sustainability Gap’) in their guest editorial to a 2008 issue of  the  Journal of Biogeography . Th is involves restoring the ‘ properties of past  functional ecosystems without attempting to create unattainable facsimiles  of the past’, not only in ‘re-wilded’ zones, moreover, but also in mixed or  ‘cultural’ landscapes, so long as, in these places, sustainable forms of  ‘commodity production’ can conceivably co-exist with fl ourishing popula- tions of free-living biota ( Manning et al.  2008 : 195). A further conceptual  shift is required here too: for while modelling of climate change impacts  continues to improve, we also need to get better at anticipating the  unforeseeable. Recognising this element of incalculability necessitates the  development of improvisational forms of ‘adaptive governance’ ( Brunner  and Lynch,  2010 ), as we seek to act responsibly under conditions of  uncertainty. As I have argued elsewhere, this entails in turn honing our  skills of creatively and compassionately ‘dancing with disaster’ ( Rigby   2009, 2015b ) in the face of the increasing frequency and intensity of  weather-borne extreme events.   Th ere is, nonetheless, a further fl aw with conventional constructions  of sustainability: one that is more fundamental than the ‘fantasy of stasis’  targeted by Mentz, and has evidently been carried over into the nested  model of sustainable development. Here, as Stacy Alaimo has observed  of the original Brundtland defi nition, ‘[n]ot only are the “generations”  usually taken to be human, but the lively world is reduced to material for  meeting their “needs” ’ ( 2012 : 562). Th is unrefl ected anthropocentrism is  indicative of the second problem identifi ed by Fischer et al.: namely, a  failure to ‘refl ect on foundational issues’ and to ‘confront potentially  uncomfortable ethical questions’ ( 2007 : 623). It is in order to redress this  </page> <page sequence="7"> 58 Discourses of sustainability shortcoming that they strongly advocate enhanced collaboration between  natural and social scientists and humanities scholars, with a view to more  eff ectively linking ‘short-term policy actions with agreed longer-term  sustainability targets’ on the basis of ‘critical analysis of foundational and  longer-term issues (e.g. values, beliefs and motivations)’ ( Fischer et al.   2007 : 623). Th is point is elaborated further in a co-authored Perspective  piece in  Nature Climate Change that desiderates the marginalisation of  the environmental social sciences and humanities from current discussions  of the ‘human dimensions’ of global climatic and environmental change  ( Castree et al.  2014 ). Conducted almost exclusively by natural and quantita- tive social scientists, existing research in this area ‘off ers little or no sense  of humans as diverse, interpretive creatures who frequently disagree about  values, means and ends; and there is no mention of power, violence,  inequality and the perennial desire of some people to replace one socio- environmental regime with another’ ( Castree et al.  2014 : 765). Occluding  cultural, philosophical and socio-political diff erences in perspective, the  sustainability agenda universalises a historically specifi c view of other- than-human ‘nature’ as a store-house of resources and provider of services  for Earth ’ s sovereign species. While this view might have counterparts  in some non-Western civilisations, it enters the discourse of sustainability  from a distinctively modern Western line of thinking. As decades of  research in the environmental humanities have clearly demonstrated, this  can be traced back to certain Greco-Roman and biblical notions of human  exceptionalism, but became consolidated in that project of human mastery  fi rst formulated as such in the context of the scientifi c revolution (a project  in which anthropocentrism was historically correlated also with andro- centrism, as Th eodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer noted in their D ialectic  of Enlightenment of 1944 (1 979:  3), and has since been examined in more  depth and detail by ecofeminist scholars such as Carolyn  Merchant  ( 1980 )  and Val  Plumwood  ( 1993 )). In order to move from ‘paradigms of conquest  to paradigms of connectivity’, as Fischer et al. propose ( 2007 : 623), or, in  Plumwood ’ s formulation of this shift, to disavow the Cartesian quest to  extend the ‘empire of man over mere things’ in favour of negotiating ‘life  membership in an ecological community of kindred beings’ ( 2009 : 119,  121), a more thoroughgoing reconceptualisation of sustainability is required:  one in which the current and future generations, whose needs are to be  met, are understood to be more-than-human.   As already noted, consideration of more-than-human fl ourishing is  given a higher priority in the nested model of sustainability to the extent  that biodiversity loss constitutes one of the planetary boundaries that  must not be transgressed (along with climate change, which is set to  compound existing pressures on wildlife habitat and dramatically escalate  the extinction rate). However, in the absence of an explicit affi  rmation of  ethical regard for other-than-human beings in their own right, the tacit  </page> <page sequence="8">  Deep sustainability 59 assumption here is that biodiversity loss should be limited primarily in  order to protect human interests in the medium to long term. Some  conservation biologists might well be among those who see the protection  of biodiversity (including genetic diversity within species) as an end in  itself, considering that while extinction is intrinsic to evolution, it is  fundamentally unethical for one species, which is possessed of the cognitive  capacity and moral discernment to do otherwise, to be condemning so  many others to oblivion at the current calamitous rate. But in societies  that remain highly ‘anthroparchal’ – characterised, that is, by systematic  forms of human domination, exploitation and marginalisation of nonhuman  others ( Cudworth  2005 : 63–70) – it is rather unsurprising that the value  of biodiversity should commonly be framed primarily in terms of its  human benefi ts. Yet, as Freya  Mathews  ( 2013 and 2016 ) has demonstrated,  the anthropocentric case for biodiversity conservation is not only ethically  questionable; it is also ultimately unconvincing.   Two of the most frequently cited grounds for biodiversity conserva- tion are particularly fl imsy. Firstly, the idea that we should save other  species (generally of the charismatic kind) so that our grandchildren  can have contact with them is readily countered by the argument that  since people only miss what they have known, future generations are  unlikely to care much about species that had disappeared before they  were born, especially as they are likely to live on as simulacra (which is  the only way that most children have contact with them today anyway,  give or take the occasional zoo visit). Secondly, the claim that people need  contact with nonhuman others and more-than-human places for their  psychophysical health provides reasonable grounds for pet ownership,  farm visits, country rambles, bush walks and the provision of urban parks  and gardens; but it does nothing for the protection of free-living species  in far-fl ung locations, where little human contact is feasible, or probably  even desirable, on a regular basis. A far sturdier anthropocentric case for  biodiversity protection can be made on the basis of its role in the provision  of ‘ecosystem services’, and it is in these terms that it is framed in the  draft Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, as Mathews observes, future  technological advances in biomimicry, such as are already underway in  the development of robotic pollinators to compensate for the decline in  honeybee populations, hold out the possibility that our fl edgling high-tech  civilisation could plausibly fl y the biospheric nest in which it hatched,  enabling future generations of humans to get along just fi ne with a radi- cally reduced suite of other species, retained either for their ornamental,  companionate or instrumental value.2    A further weakness in the anthropocentric ethic underpinning con- ventional framings of biodiversity conservation that Mathews identifi es  is that it only triggers intervention at the point of endangerment, thereby  tending towards an ‘ecology of last things’ (see Joshua Schuster ’ s essay in  </page> <page sequence="9"> 60 Discourses of sustainability this collection). Th is is actually an oxymoron, as fl ourishing ecosystems  rely not only on dynamic interrelations among diff erent species, but also  on the relative abundance of each species (with far fewer top predators,  for example, constituting a viable population by comparison with herbivores  and invertebrates). Importantly, population size is also a key factor in  maintaining genetic diversity, and hence the capacity of species to adapt  to changing conditions. Mathews therefore proposes instead an ethic of  ‘bio-proportionality’, grounded upon a generalised respect for living things  in themselves, rather than simply as service providers for humans. Th e  express goal of bio-proportionality is the optimisation of populations of  all members of those multi-species collectives (frequently including humans)  whose dynamic interrelations engender ecosystemic fl ourishing.   In the era of the Anthropocene, on a planet increasingly given over to  servicing exclusively human domiciles (however inequitably), the principle  of bio-proportionality enjoins an ethic of bio-inclusive hospitality: the  imperative, that is, to make space on ‘our’ Earth for the domiciling of  ‘otherkind’ (an ecotheological coinage that felicitously conjoins recognition  of alterity and kinship in ‘humankind ’ s’ relations with other creatures).3   Bio-proportional hospitality falls short of Jacques Derrida ’ s defi nition of  the radical categorical imperative of hospitality. Th is enjoins an uncon- ditional welcome to any and every ‘arrivant’: ‘whoever or whatever turns  up’, that is, ‘whether or not the new arrival is the citizen of another country,  a human, animal, or divine creature, a living or dead thing, male or female’  ( Derrida and Dufourmantelle  2000 : 75, 77), prior to any identifi cation,  without any expectation of reciprocity, and beyond any possible calculation  of collective wellbeing. In practice, however, hospitality towards the  ‘arrivant’ is inevitably always qualifi ed by one ’ s other duties of care, as  Derrida reminds us with the tale of the biblical patriarch, Lot, himself a  non-native inhabitant of Sodom, who off ered up his own virgin daughters  in place of his angelic guests to the Sodomites who wished to ‘penetrate’  them. An ecopolitical analogue of this might be the actions of those  legislatures that have sought to protect wildlife habitat, questionably  construed as ‘wilderness’, at the cost of expelling indigenous peoples. By  contrast, Mathews ’ s bio-proportionality ethic envisages multi-species  collectives, in which humans might well play a critical role in ‘caring for  country’, to use an Aboriginal English expression, as is already the case  across large swathes of central and northern Australia, where Native Title  holders, drawing on their traditional ecological knowledge and skills in  conjunction with a selective use of contemporary science and technology,  are engaged in vital conservation and (increasingly, anticipatory) restoration  eff orts ( Altman and Kerins  2012 ).4    Mathews also foresees a vital place for those techno-scientifi c advances  (for instance, in nutrition, housing, water use and energy production)  that could help to relieve the human pressure on the biosphere as we  </page> <page sequence="10">  Deep sustainability 61 transition to a new, ‘ecological civilisation’. 5 In addition to constraining  human population growth and consumption levels through democratically- instituted forms of sustainable development that promote social equity  and inclusion within the framework of a bio-inclusive ethic of more-than- human fl ourishing, bio-proportional hospitality would mandate the opening  up of migration corridors for species unhoused by climate change, as well  as making provision for otherkind in the face of increasingly frequent  and intense extremes. Such practices instantiate what I have elsewhere  termed ‘ecstatic hospitality’ ( Rigby  2008 ), modelled biblically in the fi gure  of Noah ’ s Ark, in which refuge is off ered by a host whose own home too  is unmoored and liable to be lost.   To frame bio-proportionality in terms of hospitality is to wager on  altruism. Personally, I think highly enough of human potential (despite  ample contrary evidence) to consider this wager worthwhile. But I am  also enough of a realist (and, for that matter, an epicurean) to share the  view of Kate Soper and her colleagues that, at least among the more  pampered citizens of the ‘developed’ world, the pleasure principle is likely  to provide a more powerful motivation for the kind of socio-ecological  transformation entailed in the bio-inclusive practice of sustainability. To  incline people towards ‘deep sustainability,’ though, might require a ‘deeper’  kind of pleasure than those forms of ‘alternative hedonism’ identifi ed thus  far under this rubric, such as ‘slow food’, self-provisioning, cycling and  sensual immersion in ‘wild’ places ( Soper et al.  2009 ). In Mathews ’ s analysis,  it necessitates nothing less than the ‘transvaluation of desires’ ( 2010 : 3),  entailing a fundamental re-orientation towards materiality  per se .   Within the limits of this chapter, it is not possible to expand upon the  onto-epistemological underpinnings of this proposed re-orientation, as  explicated by Mathews in her monograph  For Love of Matter ( 2003 ) and  explored further in R einhabiting Reality ( 2005 ).6  Put (far too) simply,  though, Mathews ’ s ‘contemporary panpsychism’, like Plumwood ’ s ‘philo- sophical animism’ ( 2009 ) and other variants of ‘new materialism’ (e.g.   Coole and Frost  2010 ), challenges the prevalent view of matter as passive,  mute and mindlessly mechanistic that came to prominence with Cartesian  dualism and Newtonian atomism. Th e inadequacy of this view was already  becoming apparent to those physicists, such as Werner Heisenberg and  Niels Bohr, who began exploring the weird and wonderful world of quantum  mechanics in the 1920s, and it is now being challenged more widely by  contemporary physicists such as Karen  Barad  ( 2007 ). In the meantime,  though, reductive materialism had become rooted in modern Western  culture, where it found a neat fi t with consumer capitalism. Stripped of  creative agency, communicative capacity and ethical considerability, the  realm of ‘mere matter’ becomes available to be mined, manipulated and  disposed of in whatever way those humans with the buying power to do  so think fi t.  </page> <page sequence="11"> 62 Discourses of sustainability  In Mathews ’ s analysis, this impoverished view of reality also profoundly  impoverishes human existence, no matter how rich in stuff  it has made  some of us, in that it tends to limit our potential for self-actualisation in  and through our intersubjectival relations with others to interactions with  fellow humans (interactions that are themselves increasingly semiotically  diminished by being reduced to words on a screen), albeit possibly sup- plemented by animal companions and/or supernatural deities. The  reductively materialist metaphysics that haunts modern Western culture  in turn feeds the hunger for ever new, ever disposable consumer trinkets  precisely because, perceived as ‘mere things’, valued not even principally  for their utility so much as for the social identities they allow their owners  to embrace and display, they forever fail to satisfy our deeper longing to  participate in an inherently meaningful more-than-human world. While  Mathews has presented carefully reasoned arguments for her alternative,  monist metaphysics for the benefi t of fellow philosophers, her version of  the cultural work of deep sustainability is more practical than theoretical.  In order to ween ourselves from reductively materialist and socio- ecologically unsustainable forms of commodity fetishism, Mathews  recommends the cultivation of practices that aff ord the deeper pleasures  of interactive self-actualisation, or co-becoming, through experiences of  intersubjective encounter, communicative interchange and, potentially,  synergistic co-creation with more-than-human others and those places  in which we might meet with them. Mathews terms such interactions  ‘ontopoetic’ ( 2009 ), and in the remainder of this chapter I consider some  examples of literary works that are conducive to this ontopoetic transvalu- ation of desire in ways that are also consistent a bio-inclusive practice of  hospitality.   Refiguring the nest: the ecopoetics of deep sustainability from  Clare to Morley   If, as suggested previously, the bird ’ s nest is taken to be both literally  and fi guratively emblematic of the life-sustaining work of contributing  to the other ’ s fl ourishing, then there is surely no better English-language  writer to consider in this connection than John Clare, who penned some  one hundred poems dedicated to birds and their nests. Clare, along with  several other Romantic writers and philosophers, has attracted a good  deal of ecocritical attention following the publication of Jonathan Bate ’ s  landmark study of ‘romantic ecology’ in  1991 ; and in his later monograph,   Th e Song of the Earth , Bate homed in on Clare ’ s nest poems in particular as  exemplary of an ecopoetics of dwelling. Yet, as Richard Kerridge observes  in his discussion of ‘Green Pleasures’ ( 2009 ), Romanticism occupies an  ambivalent position in relation to sustainability. In the infl uential analysis  </page> <page sequence="12">  Deep sustainability 63 of Colin  Campbell  ( 1987 ), the Romantic celebration of the human capac- ity to imagine possibilities that render everyday realities disappointing  by comparison nurtured an ethos of inchoate longing that became the  cradle of insatiable consumerist desire. Campbell stressed, however, that  this constitutes a historical irony, as most Romantics took a more or  less explicitly critical view of the growing commercialism of their day:  ‘Getting and spending we lay waste our powers’, proclaimed Wordsworth  in ‘Th e World is Too Much with Us’, as Kerridge recalls ( 2009 : 142). In  Kerridge ’ s view, this is an irony that ‘might conceivably cut both ways. If  Romanticism provides the structure of desire that motivates consumerism,  then Romanticism remains powerfully latent in contemporary culture:  there to be renewed in non-consumerist forms’ and capable, perhaps,  of providing a ‘bridge between pre-industrial and the post-industrial  sensibility’ ( Kerridge  2009 : 146, 147): a possibility explored further by Kate  Soper in her discussion of ‘avant-garde nostalgia and hedonist renewal’  ( 2011 ). To this I would add that Romanticism is in any case an inchoate  historical phenomenon, such that all summary characterisations, including  Campbell ’ s, ‘imply a coherence ... that close inspection calls into question’  ( Day  1996 : 5).7    Within the highly heterogeneous fi eld of British Romantic literature,  Clare defi nitely did not share the fetish for inchoate longing, preferring  instead precisely that mode of close observation of the other-than-human  inhabitants of his rural environs in all their material particularity and in  a spirit of non-appropriative empathetic attentiveness which Mathews  identifi es as a critical fi rst step towards the ontopoetic transvaluation of  desire ( 2010 : 3–4). Take, for instance, ‘Th e Nightingales Nest’, a poem  that cuts its fi gure against a long-standing literary tradition of putting  the nightingale, and above all his (or, as is more often the case in poetry,  if not in nature, ‘her’) nocturnal song, to symbolic purposes. One of the  most prevalent poetic uses of the nightingale since classical times is as a  fi gure for the joy and anguish of amorous love, and it is this anthropo- morphising trope that Clare initially invokes:  Her wings would tremble in her ecstasy   And feathers stand on end as  ’ twere with joy   And mouth wide open to release her heart   Of its outsobbing songs. ( Clare  2004 : 168)   While the charge of anthropomorphism, as Plumwood argues, is all too  often deployed as a ‘policeman for reductive materialism’ ( 2009 : 126),  patrolling the boundaries of human–nonhuman hyperseparation, the  conventionalised projection of human-referenced attributes onto a non- human other is also problematic if it blocks recognition of alterity and  singularity. Clare is evidently mindful of this risk, as he cites the conven- tional fi guration of the nightingale ’ s song precisely in order to depart  </page> <page sequence="13"> 64 Discourses of sustainability from it: fi rstly, this bird is said to be singing all day, not all night; secondly,  the use of the conditional, ‘as  ’ twere’, signals a note of uncertainty about  what this bird might actually be feeling. In the following lines, moreover,  her apparent enjoyment of the ‘happiest part / Of summer ’ s fame’ is  referenced to the poet ’ s own ‘happy fancies’. Such culturally conditioned  imaginings are counter-posed to the corporeal as well as mental eff ort  entailed in trying to apprehend this particular bird in her own sphere of  existence and world of signifi cation: her distinctively avian  Umwelt , in  Jakob von Uexküll ’ s terminology ( 2010 ).8  In so doing, however, Clare also  draws attention to the creatureliness shared by bird and human, even  while stressing the necessity of getting out of his or her comfort zone for  the would-be birdwatcher, who is depicted ‘[c]reeping on hands and knees  through matted thorn / To fi nd her nest and see her feed her young.’  Clare also hints at the conjunction of human–animal similarity and alterity  in the preceding line, which foregrounds the appetitive aspect of this  quest: ‘Th ere have I hunted like a very boy’ ( 2004 : 168). Th is simultaneously  links his current practice to, and distinguishes it from, the nest-raiding  of ‘rude boys’ (such as Clare himself had once been) – an activity now  perceived as morally dubious, being motivated not by subsistence require- ments but by the perhaps distinctively human thrill of non-nutritive  collection: one that the nightingale has learned to foil by building her  ‘secret’ nest ‘where rude boys never think to look’ ( Clare  2004 : 169).   As an adult, the speaker has evidently discovered where to look;  but the desire that propels his search is no longer appropriative, but  empathetic, and, in Mathews ’ s terms, incipiently erotic. Eros, in this view,  refers to the desire not to lustfully possess the other, but to connect with  them in such a way as to respect their alterity, whilst seeking a mutual  fl ourishing. Th e transition away from the ‘brute-striving of appetite’ to  an ‘awakened reaching-out’ ( Mathews  2003 : 150) is signalled in the shift  from the speaker ’ s initial injunction to his interlocutor in the opening  lines to ‘softly rove’ and ‘Hush!’, which serves the ambivalent purpose of  enabling them to sneak up on the nightingale, more for their benefi t than  for hers, to the later exhortation to resist the temptation to ‘trample’ on  the brambles to access her nest, mindful that ‘our presence doth retard  / Her joys’ (C lare  2004 : 170). Advancing a bio-inclusive ethic of respect  for the dwelling-places of otherkind, the speaker urges his companion  (and the poet thereby his readers) to leave ‘her home ... as we found it:  safety ’ s guard / Of pathless solitudes shall keep it still’ ( Clare  2004 : 170).  Th is shift is prompted by an empathetic attentiveness to the way in which  the bird is reading and responding to the human intruders, the cessation  of her song, alarm call (‘a plaintive note of danger’ ( Clare  2004 : 170))  and anxious movements being legible as signs of fear on the basis of the  shared creatureliness that subtends the acknowledged diff erences between  human and avian semiospheres. Th is call to compassionate self-restraint  </page> <page sequence="14">  Deep sustainability 65 is nonetheless followed by a rapturous address to the avian songstress,  hailing the ‘melody’ that ‘seems hid in every fl ower / Th at blossoms near  thy home’, and proceeding to a lingering description of her ‘curious’ and  elusive nest ( Clare  2004 : 170):    no other bird   Uses such loose materials or weaves   Its dwelling in such spots – dead oaken leaves   Are placed without and velvet moss within   And little scraps of grass and, scant and spare,   What scarcely seem materials, down and hair. ( Clare  2004 : 170)   While the poem concludes with a reiteration of the call for restraint in  order to protect the bird ’ s hidden nesting-place with its fi ve ‘curious eggs’,  altruistic concern for the other ’ s fl ourishing has now been joined by erotic  enjoyment of non-appropriative contact with a kindred being, along with  her glorious song and distinctive  Umwelt .   In his discussion of ‘Th e Yellowhammer ’ s Nest’, Washington remarks  that the titular nest is portrayed by Clare as ‘a unique composition, expertly  crafted by this individual bird within a particular ecology’ ( Washington   2014 : 668). Such nests appear as the product of a creative agency that  exists on a continuum with that of the poet in weaving his work of words,  which in turn bears witness to, and in that sense upholds, the bird ’ s  handiwork. Clare felt that his own literary productivity was actually gifted  to him by the multiple agencies of his more-than-human environs,  maintaining that he ‘found the poems in the fi elds’ (cited in  Bate  2003 :  15). Like Patrick Bresnihan, I do not believe that this should be taken as  a mere fi gure of ‘poetic sentiment’. Rather, it was indicative of Clare ’ s  recognition that his poetry was materially co-constituted by ‘the force of  the world acting on him’, it arose from his embodied encounters with  diverse others in a particular space and time, and as he attended to ‘the  way self and world were revealed, or achieved, through ongoing relations’  ( Bresnihan  2013 : 80).   While Clare indubitably draws on pastoral tropes and traditions in  much of his verse, he does not depict the multi-species collectives that  nourished his writing as entirely harmonious. As ‘one of the great poets  to chronicle the daily lives of animals, their sounds and shapes, their  habits and habitats, their wonder and welfare’, Clare also records not only  their ‘sorrows and suff erings at the hands of humans’ ( Washington  2014 :  665), but also, as in the case of the yellowhammer pair whose nest is  raided by a peckish snake, those that arise in the normal course of creaturely  existence. Th e changes that he perceived to be unfolding in association  with the enclosure of erstwhile common land, though, exposed other  creatures to a whole new regime of human domination, as well as under- mining the subsistence needs of the rural poor. Clare ’ s concern about  </page> <page sequence="15"> 66 Discourses of sustainability this wider threat to the domiciles of free-living animals doubtless informs  the anxiety that the speaker betrays in ‘Th e Nightingale ’ s Nest’ regarding  the invasiveness of his own birdwatching activities. Th is link is implicit  in the affi  rmation, ‘We will not plunder music of her dower / Nor turn  this spot of happiness to thrall’ ( Clare  2004 : 170),  thrall being the word  used to characterise the relationship of mastery and possession instituted  by enclosure in Clare ’ s protest poem, ‘Th e Mores’: ‘Th ese paths are stopped  – the rude philistine ’ s thrall / Is laid upon them and destroyed them all’  ( 2004 : 91). It is perhaps also this wider context of socio-ecological change  that motivates the move, in the concluding lines of ‘Th e Nightingale ’ s  Nest’, out of the mode of loving attentiveness to the particular – which,  as Clare surely knows, can never be captured in its concrete singularity  in any work of words, no matter how skilfully crafted – into a more  abstract and generalising register: ‘So here we ’ ll leave them, still unknown  to wrong, / As the old woodland ’ s legacy of song’ ( 2004 : 171). Th is ‘legacy’  can be read literally as the perpetuation of birdsong down the avian  generations, facilitated by the protection of their nesting-places. But it  might also be understood fi guratively, with reference to something more  like a g enius loci , such as that embodied by the speaking brook in ‘Th e  Lamentations of Round-Oak Waters’. As such it refers to a circumambient  sentience that ‘still’ inheres in the inter-specifi c co-becoming of the  commons, but that is being silenced by the conversion of this ‘animated,  sensible landscape’ ( Irvine and Gorji  2013 : 123) 9 into a mere storehouse  of ‘natural resources’: land to be rid of ‘pests’, such as the moles ‘hung ....  as traitors’, as Clare puts ‘Remembrances’ ( 2004 : 134), and rendered  ‘productive’, no longer of vibrant multi-species collectives, but of cash  crops and, thereby, taxable income for private land-owners.   As Bresnihan observes ( 2013 : 79), Clare off ers a telling image of the  new mentality associated with enclosure in one of his earliest poems, ‘A  Ramble’. Here, the speaker ’ s enchantment with ‘every trifl e nature ’ s bosom  wears’ is contrasted with the indiff erence of the ‘heedless passenger’, who:  Soodles me by, an animated post,   And ne’er so much as turns his head to look   But stalks along as though his eyes were blinded   And as if the witching face of nature   Held but now a dark unmeaning blank. ( Clare  2004 : 8)   Read in conjunction with Mathews ’ s critique of reductive materialism,  these lines disclose how the simultaneously de-animating and, as suggested  by ‘stalks’, predatory mindset of industrial modernity-in-the-making also  devitalises human subjectivity. A world stripped of its inherent meaningful- ness, reduced to a passive screen for human projections and a means for  human ends, is one in which the self-proclaimed sovereign subject too  is psychically diminished. Reduced to an ‘animated post’, she too is liable  </page> <page sequence="16">  Deep sustainability 67 to be instrumentalised as part of the support structure for a system in  which anyone, as well as anything, can be reduced to what Martin Heidegger  in ‘Th e Question Concerning Technology’ ( 1993 ) aptly termed ‘standing  reserve’ (analogous, that is, to trees defi ned as timber, left standing only  to be felled).   Arrested in his self-actualisation as a psychophysical being in com- munion with an agentic and communicative more-than-human world,  the possessive individual of the new enclosed order, where ‘Fence meets  fence in owners’ little bounds’, fi nds themselves also ‘imprisoned, ill at  ease’, as Clare puts it in ‘Th e Mores’ ( 2004 : 90). Th e dis-ease occasioned  by this cut-off  condition (for which compensation would later be found  in the increasingly frenetic shopping of commodity fetishism) contrasts  with the psychophysical nourishment aff orded by the interconnectedness  of co-becoming, such as Clare celebrated, for example, in his fond recol- lection of co-habitation with the big old tree, whose felling he laments  in ‘Th e Fallen Elm’ ( 2004 : 141–3). Hailed as a ‘friend not inanimate’, who  ‘murmured in our chimney top / Th e sweetest anthem autumn ever made’,  this beloved tree is said to have provided ‘comfort to our heart ’ s desire’,  summer shade for children ’ s play and a nesting-place for the mavis (a  thrush, whose highly musical song would no doubt have occasioned further  delight following the birds’ return from their annual migration to breed).  By contrast with the animate character of this hospitable arboreal com- panion, the landlord who had it felled is implicitly classed among those  soulless humans who (recalling the ‘animated post’ of ‘A Ramble’) are  fi gured as ‘stocks and stones ... many formed of fl esh and bones’. Here  too, a further dimension of the mindset of the new order emerges in  Clare ’ s ironic references to its rhetoric of ‘freedom’, whereby the legal  freedom of property owners to dispose of their possessions however they  see fi t is shown to be eroding the liberty, livelihood and hence life chances  of the rest. Th us, for instance, when:  Th e common heath – became the spoiler ’ s prey:   Th e rabbit had not where to make his den   And labour ’ s only cow was drove away.   ...   Such was thy ruin, music-making elm:   Th e rights of freedom was to injure thine.   As thou wert served, so would they overwhelm   In freedom ’ s name the little that was mine. ( Clare  2004 : 143)   In addition to modelling ecopoetically the cultural work of deep sustain- ability, then, Clare ’ s verse provides a diagnosis of the roots, at once  socio-economic and psycho-social, of the potentially ecocidal trajectory  of industrial modernity in the failure to cultivate delight in, and respect  for, the domiciles and lifeways of more-than-human others and the  </page> <page sequence="17"> 68 Discourses of sustainability communicative matrices co-created by their vital interactions. ‘To a Fallen  Elm’, in which the impact of the enclosed order cuts closest to home for  Clare ’ s speaker, has acquired a new salience, moreover, in light of the loss  of almost all elm trees throughout Britain, as well as much of Europe,  Canada and New Zealand. ‘Dutch Elm disease’ was fi rst identifi ed in  Holland in the 1920s, but the most recent and considerably more pathogenic  strain of the beetle-borne fungus that aff ects elms, and to which the iconic  English elm is particularly vulnerable, entered Britain only in the 1960s,  evidently on a shipment of timber from Canada ( Gibbs et al.  1994 ): Britain ’ s  elms, then, have now fallen victim  en masse  to the transnational trade in  ‘natural resources’, a key element in the unsustainable ‘Great Acceleration’  of the industrial order of the Anthropocene that Clare saw taking hold  in Helpston in the 1820s.1 0   On the eve of a new outbreak of this disease that was reported to be  threatening Britain ’ s remaining English elms in 2010 ( Seddon  2010 ),  however, some of the trees that had died previously were aff orded a kind  of afterlife in an ecopoetic art installation undertaken by David Morley  as part of a Slow Art project initiated by Chrysalis Arts on the grounds  of the Bolton Abbey Estate in Yorkshire in 2008. Morley ’ s indebtedness  to Clare as an ecopoet is most evident in the tribute that he pays his  Romantic predecessor in a book-length sonnet series entitled Th  e Gypsy  and the Poet ( 2013 ), which also honours the ‘gypsy,’ Wisdom Smith, another  frequenter of the disappearing commons with whom Clare is known to  have conversed. Himself of Roma heritage, Morley is by training a conserva- tion biologist, and committed to exploring how poetry might contribute  materially to increasing the species diversity of a given habitat. In his  contribution to the Slow Art installation, he attempted this by acquiring  some elm planks that had been stored long enough for the off ending  fungus to depart, on separate pieces of which he carved a series of haiku,  written in response to the remnant of ancient oak forest, Strid Wood, in  which they were then sited on short poles. Th e carved words of these  ‘Ankle-High Haiku’ were fi lled with potter ’ s clay and consequently teemed  with microbes from the human hands in which it had been moulded.  Th ese literally living words of clay were subsequently ‘read’, fi rstly, by  algae attracted to the microbes, then by lichens attracted by the algae,  which in turn lent the letters a greenish hue, rendering them more visible  to any passing humans (especially children, in whose eyeline they are  located), as well as attracting birds, who ‘read’ them in their own way as  a source of suitable nesting material. Morley ’ s ecopoetic experiment  instantiates a synergistic practice of more-than-human co-creation by  opening a space that invites other species to get in on the act as they  appropriate his artwork to enlarge their habitat. Stumbling upon Morley ’ s  ‘Ankle-High Haiku’, possibly while waiting for their canine companions  to add to the species diversity of the upcycled elm planks by pissing on  </page> <page sequence="18">  Deep sustainability 69 them, human visitors to Strid Wood, meanwhile, are invited by these  literally green words to attend more closely to their wooded environs.  Coming upon ‘Sussuration’, for instance, they might read:  Th e Academy   Of Ancient Root systems is   Open. Hush. Listen. ( Morley  2014 )1 1   Prompted to listen for the sound of wind in the leaves, the audible self- disclosure of the trees, human readers are encouraged also to consider,  and ideally delight in, the material intelligence, creative agency and  communicative capacity of the varied more-than-human others who have  co-created the space in which they fi nd themselves.   It was, as it happens, Morley ’ s erstwhile colleague at Warwick University,  Jonathan Bate, who launched the ecocritical re-evaluation of Clare and,  in particular, his bird ’ s nest poems to which Morley ’ s Slow Poetry project  also pays tribute, albeit more obliquely. In its interweaving of Heideggerian  phenomenology, Adorno and Horkheimer ’ s Marxist critique of the  domination of nature within capitalist modernity, and Michel Serres ’ s  notion of a ‘natural contract’, Bate ’ s take on Clare in  Th e Song of the Earth  was important in foregrounding the relationship between human psy- chophysical wellbeing and socio-ecological conditions. As I have argued  elsewhere ( Rigby  2004 ), however, I think that in his reception of Heidegger,  Bate is lured into an anthropocentric over-valuation of the poetic word:  while a poem might invoke and, in its musicality partially echo some of  Earth ’ s diverse more-than-human voices, to cast any work of merely human  words as ‘the song of the earth’ ( Bate  2000 : 251) risks falling prey to a  colonising kind of human self-aggrandisement. From a posthumanist  material ecocritical perspective, then, it is important to stress that for all  the tender protectiveness that Clare ’ s poems evince towards birds and  their nests, they themselves are, as it were, empty nests, inevitably failing  to provide the space for the nurturance of fl ourishing more-than-human  life that he so desperately, and ultimately despairingly, sought to safeguard.  As an element in the wider discursive–material matrix in which humans  intra-act with more-than-human others, however, literature that invites  its readers to pay empathetic attention to the surprising lives and strange   Umwelten of otherkind can potentially help to foster the bio-inclusive  ethos of hospitality that necessarily undergirds a bioproportional model  of sustainability, as well as awakening a desire to experience the kinds of  ontopoetic encounter that such literature might invoke. But only ‘poten- tially’: for, to recall a motto of the Scholastics, ‘whatever is received is  received according to the mode of the receiver’ (q uodquip recipitur ad  modum recipientis recipitur ;  Bretzle  2013 : 200), which is in turn dependent  upon a host of extra-literary material–discursive factors (cultural, social,  political, economic, geographic, institutional, personal etc.).  </page> <page sequence="19"> 70 Discourses of sustainability  Th e same is true, of course, of the human reception of Morley ’ s ‘Ankle- High Haiku’. As a work of ecopoetics, however, the Slow Poetry trail  marks a necessary movement beyond both the cultural-historical and  aesthetic limits of Romantic nature poetry. At a time of escalating anthro- pogenic extinctions, Clare ’ s ethic of letting be is insuffi  cient: the restoration  of bioproportionality demands that humans actively create aff ordances  for the fl ourishing of other species, whose habitat, like that of the woodland  birds invited to avail themselves of the lichen on Morley ’ s ‘Ankle-High  Haiku’, is being anthropogenically eroded. 12 Moreover, at a time when  ever more people, and especially children, are being lured into simulacral  worlds of more or less exclusively human construction, ecopoetic projects  that draw their recipients outdoors have a better chance than mere words  on a page of fostering a taste for the alternative hedonism aff orded by  spending time with free-living plants and animals and the lively, com- municative and (if we follow Mathews ’ s panpsychist premise) sentient  places in which they might be met. Making material provision for other- than-human dwelling through creative practices of bio-inclusive hospitality,  ecopoetics beyond-the-page simultaneously works towards the transvalu- ation of human desires by opening recipients to the deep pleasure of  ontopoetic encounter.   Clearly there is much that needs to be done in a range of ways and  contexts, and with varying degrees of urgency and diffi  culty, to bridge  the sustainability gap. Literature, especially that which entails and discloses  intra-active processes of multi-species co-creation, can play a part in this  by contributing to that shift in underlying attitudes, assumptions, values  and desires which would be conducive to the safeguarding of planetary  boundaries in the interests of the renewed fl ourishing of Earth’ s  diverse  more-than-human life.   Notes   1  Plumwood ’ s move into literary territory in this essay was encouraged by  the invitation to present a keynote lecture at the 2002 conference of the UK  Association for the Study of Literature and Environment: the essay is based  on that plenary presentation, and enriched by the discussions it occasioned.   2  See also  Conniff   ( 2012 ) for a succinct discussion of a number of other lines  of critique of the concept of ‘ecosystem services’ and, in particular, attempts  to price them.   3  See e.g. Nash, who refers to ‘all creatures, human and otherkind’ ( 1996 : 9).  More recently, Anne Elvey has defi ned this term more inclusively to include  ‘both those we understand as living (e.g., fl eas, whales, and eucalypts) and  those we understand otherwise (e.g., glaciers, sand, and air)’ ( 2014 : 36).   4  ‘Caring for country’ should not be confused with Western ecofeminist ‘ethics  of care’. It has a foundation in traditional ecological knowledge (‘Law’), rather  </page> <page sequence="20">  Deep sustainability 71 than sentiment (although Indigenous Australians do evince a high degree of  aff ective attachment to their ancestral homelands) ( Rose et al.  2002 ). Presup- posing more-than-human agency, communicative capacity and human– nonhuman connectivity and kinship, ‘caring for country’ entails something  rather more like the considered practice of intra-active material–discursive  interrelationship among diverse human and nonhuman actants envisaged by  Adeline  Johns-Putra  ( 2013 ) in her new materialist model of environmental  care. Th e (thus far) most extensive historical study that amply evidences the  socio-ecological effi  cacy of Aboriginal land management in sustaining very  high levels of biodiversity over extremely long time periods is  Gammage   ( 2011 ). It should be stressed that this case should not be assumed to be  universally representative of indigenous culture  per se , not does it preclude  the possibility that the distant ancestors of Australia ’ s First Nations peoples  might have inadvertently contributed to the extinction of the megafauna that  they encountered on this continent some 40–60,000 years ago, many of which  nonetheless co-existed with humans for at least another 30,000 years, suc- cumbing only after the climate changed from cold-dry to warm-dry and  water became scarcer at the end of last glacial maximum ( Musser  2014 ).   5  ‘Ecological civilisation’ is a Chinese concept with roots in Taoist philosophy  that Mathews has been studying for several years, in collaboration with col- leagues in China. Mathews currently holds the position of Adjunct Professor  of Eco-Civilisation Studies at Monash University ’ s Institute of Sustainability.   6  For an overview, see  Rigby  ( 2006 ).   7  On Romanticism and ecocriticism, see  Rigby  ( 2014 ).   8  Clare ’ s attention to species-specifi c U mwelten is also discussed by  Washington   ( 2014 : 666) and examined in the wider context of Romantic-era precursors  to biosemiotics in  Rigby  ( 2015a ).   9  In this connection, Irvine and Gorji cite from a letter Clare wrote in connec- tion with his relocation from Helpston to Northborough: ‘the very molehills  on the heath and the trees in the hedgerow seem bidding me farewell’  ( 2013 : 123).   10  Evidence for the Great Acceleration is provided in  Steff en  ( 2004 ) in a series  of graphs charting changes in human activities and correlating environmental  impacts along j-curves, all of which take off  during or from the 1950s.   11  This is also discussed in the series of Slow Poetry videos available at   www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/audio/more/slowpoetry .   12  Morley ’ s contribution to the Slow Art project also involved the commissioning  of a series of bird-boxes, on each of which he inscribed a poem that he had  written in response to the morphology, habits and vocalisation of the particular  species for which the box was likely to be most attractive. Dubbed ‘Bard  Boxes’, these were then sited in appropriate places to aff ord additional nesting  opportunities ( Morley  2014 ).   References   Adorno ,  Th eodor  and  Max  Horkheimer  [1944] 1979 .
