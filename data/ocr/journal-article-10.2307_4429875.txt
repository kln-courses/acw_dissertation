<plain_text><page sequence="1">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY AN ANALYSIS OF HERODOTOS HIST. VII 12-19; 47 BY R. G. A. VAN LIESHOUT The present essay x) deals with the dream which, in Herodotos' version, appears twice to Xerxes and once, on invocation, to Arta- banos, at the eve of the final confrontation of East and West. Our comments will focus successively on the terminology of the story, the contents of the dream, the dream-apparition, the interpretation of the dream, the magic ritual, Artabanos' criticism, the origin of the dream, the literary situation and the question of Persian or Greek (Herodotean) origin of the story; finally some notes are made on ethico-religious implications of the story. "Die R?tselhaftigkeit und Wichtigkeit der Geschichte f?r das Ganze rechtfertigen sicher- lich die vielen Versuche einer Analyse", notes P. Frisch in his recent commentary on the passage 2). a. Terminology The dream-story offers a great variety in terminology in the wording of the dream-experience : ?? t? ???t? e?de ????

(?3&gt;t) ? d?ape???sa? ???eta? (15,2). Striking details in this terminology are : 1. that ?de?? appears only once; 2. that the coming, staying and going of the dream-apparition is more or less locally indicated with verbs such as: ?p?f??t??, ?p?p?t??a?, p?a????a?, ?????a?, f??t??, ?f?sta?a?, ?pe??sta?a?, ?????a?, ?p?p?t??a?; 3? that the dream?as is more often the case?is introduced as personal and speaking, so that the distinction between dream and dream-apparition no longer exists (cf. e?pe??, ?pe???e??, ??? ???ta, d?a?e?e???e???) ; 4? that more abstract verbs such as (?p?)fa??es?a? (especially) and pep?a??s?a? occur only between c. 16 ? 2, from where Artaba- nos gives his enlightened view of dreams (? 1 is a quotation), and 17, where the dream takes Artabanos himself by surprise. In c. 47?an after-consideration of the dream?the term fa??es?a? appears again. It can also be observed that only in this enlightened reflection are the terms for dream general and vague too: e??p??a, ???e? (t??) ??e???t??. The word ??e???? is explicitly and always replaced either by critical expressions like : d t? d? ??t? ?st? t? ?p?fa????e??? t?? ?? t? ?p???as if the word itself were too defining?or it is only in- dicated by 'it'. Only when by way of introduction Artabanos re- peats parts of Xerxes' account, does he use d?e????. But, again, here it is remarkable that only in his mouth is the word used in the masculine. Could it be that Artabanos thinks the traditional ter- minology misleading ? ?) ?) ?. Latte, Gnom. 5 (1929), 161 ?. ?, rightly remarks that the ???e? pep?a?????a? in Her. VII 16 cannot be proved to be a trace of a theory ascribed to Demokritos by Aristotle De div. p. somn. 464 a 9, since it assumes without sufficient grounds a similar meaning for d??e? pep?a?????a? and e?d??a (?p????a?) fe???e?a ( = ?olitantibus umbris, Petroniusfr. 30, or rerum simulacra, Lucr. IV 32). The verb pep?a??s?a? also occurs in Heliodoros Aeth.

Also the terms for dream are very varied: d???, d?e????, d?e????, e??p??a, ???e? (t??) ??e???t??, d??? t?? e??p????, d??? t?? ??e????. We note here : d??? is used on 7 occasions, and either by ?? t? ???t?, ??e???t?? (e??p???? and ??e????), or by the general context, restricted to dream-vision. Once the plural of d??? is used. At least 5 times the neuter d?e???? is used; twice the genitive ??e???? as such cannot be defined as to gender; once the masculine d?e???? is found; ??e??ata once appears as determinant ; e??p??a appears once ; e??p???? functions as determinant. b. Contents The same dream appears three times, twice to Xerxes and once to Artabanos. Three times the same distinct order is given, negatively: not to recall a decision already taken ; positively : to throw a bridge across the Hellespont and to march against Hellas. The dream no- where suggests the outcome of the battle and therefore cannot be qualified as a deceptive dream-order 2). A climax is to be seen in the t???? ??e???t?? pep?a??????? teta?a??????. A superficial reading of Helio- doros' dream-stories left the impression of a Herodotean terminology. i) Cf. Liddell and Scott: "In early writers only in pass., . . . become visible, appear". This verb seems to suggest the reality rather than the subjective character of the dream. It would seem that Frisch presses the connotation of 'subjective', 'personal?, 'psychological* too much, when he infers from Herodotos' use of d??e?? on one hand, and from his conviction of the divine origin on the other: "In der Zeit beginnenden Religionsverfalls und rationaler Welterkl?rung verteidigt er besorgt seine fromme Ansicht, wie wenig er auch ?bersehen kann, dass die Tr?ume wirklich nur inneres Erleben des Menschen sind" (o.e., 48, 49). 2) Therefore R. Crahay, La litt?rature oraculaire chez H?rodote (Paris 1956), 222: "?l?ment nouveau: les dieux veulent abuser Xerx?s" seems wrong. Moreover, it is too anthropomorphic. The fate-god only intimates that the Hellespont should be bridged, and the expedition should be under- taken. No defeat or success is suggested, however, unless it be the personal failure of Xerxes, should he disobey. In this respect any identification of this type of dream and anthropomorphic deceit by the gods in Horn. II. II 1 sqq. does not seem to be to the point, as H. R. Immerwahr, Tat und Ge- schichte bei Herodot, in: W. Marg, Herodot. Eine Auswahl aus der neueren Forschiing (M?nchen 1962), 525, rightly observes (cf. Eusth. ad II. II 8; 166, 7).</page><page sequence="4">228 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY threats: first it says: returning to your decision is wrong, and I am against you ; next : if you do not advance, your star will descend as quickly as it ascended ; finally, after a repetition of the threat to Xerxes and an appeal to t? ??e?? ?e??s?a? the apparition proceeds to action: it begins to burn out Artabanos' eyes with hot irons ?). c. The dream-apparition The identity of the dream-apparition is once indicated by ??d?a ???a? te ?a? e?e?d?a, as for example in V 56 2). The great problem for Xerxes and Artabanos is : is it a divine messenger, whose orders are to be obeyed without comment (e? ?? ?e?? ?st? ? ?p?p??p??; ?e?? t???? p??p?; ?e?a, t? t?? ?e??? ?et????; da?????? ????; ta ?? t?? ?e?? pe?p??e?a) ? Or is the dream pa?' ??de??? ? The repetition of the dream and a few other criteria, which we shall introduce later, weight the scale in favour of the divine origin of the dream-appear- ance. This solves the problem of whether the order must be obeyed. Hey rightly observes: "Dieser Traumd?mon ... handelt ... ganz wie ein vern?nftiges Wesen" 3). d. Interpretation The contents of the order of the '?bermensch' (superman) are clear as daylight ; only it is not clear if it is to be taken seriously, as i) As to this punishment see Jerem. 39, 7; 52, rr, where Nebuchadnezzar orders Zedekiah's eyes to be burnt out. Cf. Heliod. Aeth. II 16, where a terrifying dream-apparition deprives the dreamer of one eye.. The interpreta- tion given by Knemon is in harmony with Artemidoros Onirocr. I 26 (Pack, p. 32 s.) : it announces evil for sons, brothers and parents,, when the dreamer is blinded on both eyes. If only one eye is blinded, the death of one son, brother or parent is announced.?See also Tac. Hist. IV 83-85, where the dream-story shows similar features: superhuman size and beauty of the ap- parition, repetition of the same dream, a climax of threat and the feature of the 'Doppeltraum', here too not simultaneous. 2) K. Abicht (Comm. ad toc.) mentions other passages in Herodotos in which beauty and size appear combined: VII 187 (??d?e?); Ill ? (????t??); I 112 (pa?d???); cf. also IX 96; I 60. Besides Her. V 55-56, Aisch. Pers. 39 and Xen. Cyr. VIII 7, Plato Crit. 44 A also describe dream-apparitions in a similar way. Sextus Empiricus gives a similar description of the Democritean e?d??a, which characteristics would bring about among men the idea of 'god' (Adv. mathem. IX 19, 42). For later references (e.g. Liv. VIII 6, 9-11; Tac. Hist. IV 83-85) see L. Deubner, De incubatione cc. IV (Leipzig 1900), 12-13. 3) F. O. Hey, Der Traumglaube der Antike (M?nchen 1908), 30.</page><page sequence="5">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 22? it is given in a dream. The way in which the divine significance is defined, and the crescendo in the reaction to the dream, provide in- teresting data for the interpretation of the dream. Xerxes does not take the first appearance seriously (????? ??d??a ?p???et?) and acts for the rest on his own insight, as if he had not had a dream at all. When, however, the dream repeats itself, he jumps out of bed pe??de??, and sends for Artabanos. He assures him that a second repetition of the dream, but this time to Artabanos, would give him absolute certainty as to the divine significance, and he orders Artabanos to force this certainty by luring the apparition to him by means of magic procedure. To this end Artabanos must take the regalia, sit on the throne, and then sleep in the king's bed, a ritual, which Artabanos?after an interesting protest?performs. This 'private incubation' is successful in as much as Artabanos does dream the same dream again, though the dream-apparition was obviously not to be deceived. The apparition now even proceeds to action?which makes the e????e?a more reckless still. Artabanos jumps out of bed with a cry and tells Xerxes his dream and his 'conversion' as a result of it. Artabanos' wisdom by experience, by which he sees the risks of Xerxes' reckless and ambitious plan is now contrasted with knowledge by 'revelation', by which he dis- covers a da?????? t?? ???? at the back of the event. When he con- cludes that a f???? t?? ?e??at?? threatens the Greeks, he goes far beyond the data of the dream. In c. 47 the dream is mentioned again, and there it appears that Artabanos' conversion was not all that whole-hearted. He eagerly desires that the dream (which one?) should result in what both of them wish, but up till then he is de??at?? ?p?p?e?? ??d' e?t?? ??e??- t??. There he appears not (any longer) to belong to the ?pa????te? t? d?? of c. 18,4 *). Here the significance of the dream for Xerxes as well as for ?) W. Marg (o.e., 299) forgets to take c. 47 into his description of Arta- banos' total reaction to the dream: "Der falschen Sicherheit des religi?sen und nationalen Egoismus kann also auch der vorsichtige Alte nicht entgehen". But it is this c. 47 which makes it clear that, even after the dream, Artabanos has not this certainty. Marg continues: "Sein K?nigsglaube wirkt ihm hier den Irrtum". I shall argue that Artabanos does not consider the dream- er's kingly status a criterion for the divine origin at all.</page><page sequence="6">230 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY Artabanos appears to depend on the repetition, preferably in different subjects, and on the e????e?a, a property which could be rendered by 'alive', 'vivid' *), and which is a typical feature for the apparition of gods, heroes and men. e. The magic ritual Xerxes proposes to evoke the repetition of the dream in a person other than himself, and for that person he makes use of a ritual which may be qualified as 'magic' or 'theurgic'. Artabanos must deck himself with the regalia, sit on the throne and sleep in the king's bed. The rite betrays the following religious convictions in a some- what rudimentary way. i. Only kings and their equals can have significant dreams. We do not find this conviction only here; it also seems implied in Herodotos' story of Kuros' death (I 209-211) 2), and it is explicitly stated in Homer, II. II 80 through the mouth of Nestor. Aristotle wonders how dreams, if god-sent, would appear regardless of intelligence or social status (De div. p. somn. 462 b 20 ff.). Again, it is recorded by Artemidoros, in his Onirocr. I 23), as a criterion to be ?) Cf. Her. V 55-56 and Aisch. Pers. 179-181. There is some analogy be- tween the e????e?a of a dream, which correlates in some way or another with absolute certainty of truth or reality in the dreamer, and the compelling character of religious 'objects' or 'truths', which correlates with unshakable faith on the side of the believer ('real knowledge' in contrast with 'notional knowledge', says Newman; the overwhelming feeling of religious realities, which seems the main problem of the science of religion, and the criterion for its object). In either case, the correlation involves a strong personal note, on both sides, and it seems to be there all of a sudden ('conversion'), and almost against conscious intentions and logic. "... ein mystisches Erlebnis (kann) durch eine ganz besondere seelische Realit?t sich von einer Halluzination unterscheiden", says K. Ker?ny (Apollon, Studien ?ber antike Religion und Humanit?t, Wien 1937, 23-27)? People who have this strong conviction of reality of their dreams (or prayers, or even mathematical truths) can only make other people share this conviction by evoking in them the same cor- relation. That is what Xerxes tried to do with Artabanos, by trying to let him have the same dream. 2) Frisch (o.e., 53) rightly observes that in Herodotos' Historiai ten dreams are dreamed by kings, and he seems to suggest that Herodotos him- self did accept the principle that only kings could have relevant dreams. 1 find it hard to accept this suggestion. 3) Pp. 9-11 Pack. Cf. also Macrobius (Comm. Ill 14-17) on the question whether Scipio could be the proper person to have a dream which had public and universal relevance.</page><page sequence="7">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 23I used for the acceptance of a dream as significant : only a ?as??e??, an ????? or t?? t?? ?e??st???? (he specifies: st?at????, ?e?e??, ???t?? of the polis) is qualified to receive dreams, which are relevant for ta d???s?a: t??t??? ?a? ?a? pef???t?sta? ta ?????; Artemidoros adds : one commoner (?d??t??), on his own, can never dream a dream which has political significance, but when many commoners dream about the same issue, and reveal their dreams, they make the d???? the recipient of the dream: st?at????, ?????t?? ??d?? ?tt??. Ar- temidoros refers for this criterion to Nikostratos of Ephesos and Panyasis of Halikarnassos. Thus the history of mantic privilege becomes significant for social history1). The reservation of signi- ficant dreams to qualified persons reminds us of a similar reser- vation of other kinds of mantic abilities to descendants of royalty, as for example the Iamids at Olympia. It furthermore seems implied in Aisch. Agam. 1084, where the chorus is surprised that the divine gift of prophecy should still abide in Kassandra's mind, though she be enslaved. According to Plutarch apparitions of the gods are the privilege of an ?lite (De genio Socr. 589 D; 593 D-C) 2). 2. The success of the dream-incubation?which at first was not only used medically3)?can be stimulated or forced4), for in- ?) Cf. Salomon's dream in Gibeon (I. Kings 3, 5-16; Chron. 1, 6-14) and Daniel's dream in the Legend of Aqht: "both to be qualified as provoked incubation dreams experienced by kings. Obviously, such a dream is here considered a royal privilege", says L. Oppenheim, The Interpretation of Dreams in the Ancient Near East, Transact. Am. Philos. Soc, N.S. 46 (1956), part 111, 188. Among other samples of royal incubation in the ancient Near East Oppenheim also mentions the dream of Sethos, in Her. II 139 (cf. also incubation as a privilege for priests in Arr. Anab. VII 26, 2). Furthermore, Oppenheim draws attention to dreams of Gudea and Nabonidus, "both being provoked in order to confirm the interpretation of a symbolic dream seen by these rulers" (p. 139). 2) W. R. Halliday, Greek Divination (London 1913, repr. Chicago 1962), 67-70, observes on the connection of ?a?t?s??? and royalty: "it is closer the farther back you trace the history of divination". Cf. also Ps. Kallisthenes 2,1. 3) Not even at Epidauros, as appears from IG IV2, 122, 19 sqq. Cf. O. Weinreich, Antike Heilungswunder (Giessen 1909), in, note 1. 4) Xerxes' resort to incubation in order to force the dream-apparition to reappear, might be regarded as a remnant of an old belief, that ritual involves 'G?tterzwang' (magic); cf.

Wolters, Der gefl?gelte Seher, Sitz.-ber. der Bayer. Akad. der Wissensch. 1928: 1, 5-6. 2) Walton o.e., 78 : "It is an old superstition that to sleep in white induced dreams". It does occur in the Isyllos-hymn. See also Philostr. V.A. VIII 7. L. Deubner deals with it in more detail as far as it occurs in the chthonic cult and in magic (o.e., 25). 3) A spring is, for example, to be found in connection with every Askle- pieion. Walton (o.e., 40) and Halliday (o.e., 124 sqq.) put forward two texts which in their opinion connect water and oracular power in general. Paus. VII 21, 13 does not deal with dreams, but with medical catoptromancy (lecano- mancy) at Patrai; here the quality of truth attached to water is evident. Plut. Arist. XI tells how the Plataean general learnt the right meaning of the Delphian oracle via a dream; water is not mentioned, unless indirectly via the term ???f???pt??, active in a manteion on the Kithairon, to which Arimnestos perhaps belongs. L. Deubner mentions only a drinking from holy sources in order to promote true dreams in the ritual which preceded the consultation of Trophonios?which he wrongly takes to be a dream-incuba- tion (o.e., 24). He gives the references where subtiliores sensus (Plin. Nat. Hist. XXXI 2, 12) are the result of drinking water, but here dreams are not involved. Philostratos (V.A. I 6) mentions how the drinking of water from a spring near Tyana, sacred to Zeus Orkios, affects perjurers. Similar pro- cedures in manticism and taking an oath are often to be found. As W. R. Halliday observes : in oaths, rivers frequently figure as divine witnesses and punishers of perjury (o.e., 117, and note 3 for references). M. Ninck, Die Bedeutung des Wassers in Kult und Leben der Alten (Leipzig 1921, repr.</page><page sequence="9">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 233 3? Decking oneself with the typical attributes of a king or of a god is not necessarily an usurpation, but rather an attempt at iden- tification in the religio-mystical sense. In order to intensify contact with Apollo, the Delphic Pythia among other ritual acts occupies the God's ritual seat, says E. R. Dodds x). It is part of the Greek phenomena which Back signalises under the title "De caerimoniis, in quibus agebantur dei aliquid facientes" 2). Reinhardt expresses himself as follows: "Die Person des Warners, wenn sie in der Haut des K?nigs steckte, angetan mit der Magie der K?nigsw?rde... sie erf?hre ganz das Gleiche' ' 3). 4. Dreaming, so to speak by proxy, is a common phenomenon, notably attested more than once in the Epidaurian ???ata4). In Herodotos it appears twice, attested by barbaroi, it is true, but in a Darmstadt i960) establishes 'tertia comparationis' between water (demons) and dream (apparitions) : the unlimited capacity of changing and adapting of both water and dreams; the reality of a dream-apparition in dark sleep resembles the (three-dimensional) image in the dark water-mirror; both the experience of sleep and the hearing and sight of rushing water seem in a position to arouse a dreaming mental condition (cf. some pieces of modern art in the London Tate Gallery). 1) The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1951), 73. 2) F. Back, De Graecorum caerimoniis, in quibus homines deorum vice fungebantur (Diss. Berol. 1883). The term 'magical' is perhaps less justified than the term 'sacramental' is anachronistic. Back cites mystery-plays like the hierogamy, the play of Apollo's miasma and purification at Delphi, the play of Demeter and Persephone, the play of Diana's pursuit at Tegea. Priests and priestesses act the parts of the gods, and in particular animal at- tributes often have a function and determine their titles. In Aischylos' Per sai Dareios is strangely concerned about the clothes of Xerxes (v. 832). Can we detect here the same belief in attributes ? ("Fine feathers make fine birds"?). Or does Wilamowitz's reference to stage technique provide a satisfactory explanation: "Die K?nigin musste entfernt werden" (Aischylos-, Interpretationen, Berlin 1914, 46) ? F. Stoessl (Die Trilogie des Aischylos, Baden bei Wien 1936, 160) points out that there was no dramatic need at all to dismiss Atossa from the stage. He prefers to trace v. 845 back to the Phoinissai of Phrynichos, Aischylos' substratum for the Persai. Aischylos will then have failed to adapt this piece smoothly to its new surroundings. 3) K. Reinhardt, Herodots Persergeschichten, in: Marg, o.e., 367. 4) IG2, IV, 122, 1-7; Strabon XVII 1, 17 (in the temple of Sarapis at Kanobos near Alexandria) ; XIV 1, 44 (in the Charonion near Ocharaka at Nysa). Also the coincidences of dreams in incubant and the person giving the order or in a relative of the incubant are mentioned, for example the mother, who dreamt on behalf of Arata : both had the same dream.</page><page sequence="10">234 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY Greek incubation-oracle x). That our present passage should show an "unm?nnliche Gesinnung des Grossk?nigs", and should be meant to be comic, seems the exegesis of a 20th century Prokrustes 2). Gabriel Germain 3) tries to read Herodotos' dream story on the eve of the great enterprise with an 'esprit babylonien'?as recon- structed by Frazer and Ren? Labat. Notably the ritual of the enthronement of a king's substitute would, according to them, point to the so-called 'Year-king' (i.e. Artabanos), who at ominous moments to be fixed by astrologers (i.e. the expedition against Hellas) would replace the proper king (i.e. Xerxes), and after receiving the blows would be killed (Artabanos lived on, and that is why Xerxes' expedition failed). In Germain's opinion Herodotos learned this story from an anti-Achemenid source. He rendered it as faithfully as possible, but he appears not to have understood it in an oriental spirit, which is particularly clear from his omitting ?????? in Artabanos' speech. Herodotos is thought to have judged the story ''selon ses habitudes de bon sens", and these excluded the idea of a "roi vicaire des dieux et duquel ?manaient contin?ment des pouvoirs surnaturels". Thus from the Assyro-Babylonian tradi- tion Germain considers the enthronement of a king's substitute the key to the right understanding of the story. To Herodotos, however, the incubation of a substitute is the clue, and we may confine our- selves to this view, as we are attempting to register Greek associations and annotations to dream-stories. f. Artabanos' criticism Artabanos refuses to obey the first order, as he does not think himself worthy of sitting on the royal throne (??? ???e??e???). Was h e afraid such a deed might be condemned as usurpation or high- t reason?as once happened to Smerdis, though he was only found sitting on the throne in a dream? 4) Was he afraid he would do ?)

The term ???e??e??? is not decisive in these questions, but after the protest the last two possibilities no longer seem likely. The text only allows for a humble obedience in order to show that Xerxes was talking nonsense (c. 17,1 ??p???? ?????? ?p?d??e?? ?????ta ??d??). At last Artabanos obeys under compulsion and after a pro- test which we would paraphrase in direct speech as follows: "despite the ambitious advice of bad men always to be aiming at more than one has, you have at last chosen the best thing. But now you have changed your mind again. Why? Because you had a dream which ordered you to do so, and this in the name of a god : ?e?? t???? p??p?. Let me, as one so much older, teach you what dreams really are. Things that worry us in the day-time usually haunt us in the form of dreams at night. Dreaming is the nightly free-wheeling of intense mental activity of the day. And consequently there is nothing divine about it (??d? ?e?a). But just suppose you are right, i.e., that this dream had something divine (t? t?? ?e??? ?et????), then I must ?in this you are right? have this dream too (for I am the only person who gave you the opposite advice), and this without the trick of disguise, or a changing of beds. For if what appears in your dream (d t? d? ??t? ?st? t? ?p?fa????e??? t?? ?? t? ?p??) is to be deceived by garments, this would be the very proof of its nonsensical nature. Therefore I propose something different : we must find out if i) Crahay, o.e., 222; cf. Plut. Alex. 73-74, ?. See also Frisch, o.e., 16: "Artabanos str?ubt sich vor dem b?sen Omen ... Es beschw?rt nicht etwa die Einsetzung des Artabanos als neuen K?nig herauf, sondern Entmachtung oder Tod des Xerxes". "Denn auch im Traum des Kyros soll die Er- scheinung des Dareios nicht diesen als neuen Herrscher ank?ndigen, sondern die Aufmerksamkeit des Tr?umers auf sich selbst lenken". I cannot follow the causal connection ('denn' ) between Artabanos' fear for the omen and the personal significance of dreams dealing with others than the dreamer himself. I cannot agree with Frisch when he opposes: "Die Furcht des Artabanos vor dem Omen zeichnet ihn als einen ergebenen und in pr?logischen Vorstel- lungen denkenden Menschen, nicht etwa als Rationalisten. . .". As I see it, both attitudes are present and, as I shall try to show, necessary in a man of religio-ethical perfection.</page><page sequence="12">236 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY the dream keeps coming back to you. If this is actually the case, I will also accept that the dream comes from god, even if I myself have not had the dream, with or without changing garments. Be- sides, I will, of course, obey, if you insist on my attempt having the dream via the disguise. Again, I too am prepared to accept the validity of such a dream, albeit for reasons different from yours' \ Salient points in Artabanos' protest are : a. a rational, psychological explanation of the dream-phenomen- on, as had already been given by Empedokles (at least according to later doxographical literature) and as occurs in Hippocratean literature 1) is expressed here. Allowance is, however, made for exceptions (???as?). b. These exceptions become clear when the dream repeats itself 2). c. A magical procedure like simulating royal dignity is, even if it seems successful, no proof of the special character of the dream. On the contrary: it is unworthy of a god, because it shows stupidity3). d. Significant dreams are no status-symbol. i) Empedokles fr. 108 (DK): see the quotations of Philoponos and Simplikios in DK ad loc.\ Hippokr. Morb. Sacr. 17; Insomn. 3 ( = Viet. 88). Cf. S. Freud, Der Traum, I4te Vorlesung, p. 254 (Koehler, 578 sqq., 1922): "Die Einwirkung der Wunschregung auf die Tagesreste schafft den weiteren Anteil der latenten Traumgedanken, jenen, der nicht mehr rationell und aus dem Wachleben begreiflich erscheinen muss". The theme that dreams are the day's residues ("quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit") is beautifully elaborated in a fragment of Petronius (nr. 30; p. 121 Heraeus). This view more usually occurs in literature with an Epicurean tinge, combating the Stoic theory that dreams could be sent by the gods. 2) Repetition of the same dream bringing about a climax of terror can be established frequently in ancient literature, e.g. Genesis 41, 1-7: Pharaoh's dream; Aisch. Pers. 176 s. and Prom. 645 sqq. Chrysippos, Stoic. Vet. Fr. 2, no. 120 s. : a man who is about to be murdered at Megara thrice appears in his relatives' dream (cf. Cic. De divinai. I 57; Val. Max. F acta et diet. mem. ?, ? ext. io) ; Livy II 36, 1 sqq. : Titus Latinius' dream. About the greater reliability of dreams which repeat themselves see Artem. Onirocr. IV 27. 3) Also elsewhere in Herodotos the immorality of 'G?tterzwang' (theurgy) or trying out the godhead is suggested. For instance, to Herodotos Kroisos' and Mardonios' trying and selecting of the oracles is clearly not good man- ners from the Hellenic religious point of view (I 46; VIII 133-134)?no more than Polykrates' attempt at warding off divine f????? by throwing away what is dearest to him (III 40-41) ; cf. H. Klees, Die Eigenart des griechischen Glaubens an Orakel und Seher (Stuttgart 1965). O.Weinreich points out that</page><page sequence="13">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 237 The private incubation takes place in spite of Artabanos' protest, and a striking point in this is that the actual dream not only ans- wers the criteria of divine significance required by both Xerxes and Artabanos?viz. repetition and e????e?a?but also the special criteria put forward by Artabanos: first, that the dream must know to whom it is talking, or?negatively?that the dream-apparition is not deceived by the garments ; and secondly, that the dream must appear irrespective of persons. The dream actually begins by rudely identifying Artabanos: "So you are that man (?e????), who tries to prevent Xerxes' expedition against Hellas, out of so-called anxiety for him!" In other words the dream-appearance is independent of magic ritual and royal dignity. And so Artabanos too had to acknowledge the divine origin of the dream, for it fulfilled the criteria required by him x). g. Origin The question as to the origin of the dream, framed in terms in which ?e?? 2), ?e??? 3) and da??????? 4) function, has after some ar- information given by spontaneous dreaming was considered more relevant than the information given through dreams evoked by means of ???????s??, a practice particularly current among the uneducated (Heilungswunder, ? io). ? ) Can Artabanos' four criteria for the divine significance of the dream be called 'rational' ? It seems not. It is hardly possible to say that here the divine origin of the dream is proved via a 'ganz rationales Beweisverfahren', as A. Lesky qualifies the argumentation (G?ttliche und menschliche Motivation im homerischen Epos, Sitzungsber. Heidelb. Ak. der Wiss., 1961, nr. 4, 48). 2) Twice without and twice with an article?which, according to W. P?t- scher does not determine the idea ?e?? any further, but only makes it more pregnant (G?tter und Gottheit bei Herodot, Wiener Stud. 71, 1958, 5-29). 3) t? t?? ?e??? ?et????: conj. Schweigh?user, followed by Hude (OCT), Kallenberg (Teubner) and Legrand (Bude). All the MSS, however, have ?e??. T? ?e??? elsewhere occurs in Herodotos only four times : I 32, 1 ; III 40, 2; III 108, 2; IX 100, 2 (plural). The adjective ?e??? occurs frequently, e.g. I 126, 6; II 66, 3; III 139, 3; VI 69, 3; VIII 94, 1. I have taken these in- stances mainly from P?tscher (art. cit., 23, note 56). It is remarkable that the substantive is used whenever the 'wise counsellor' is speaking.?Cf. also L. Bieler, Te??? ????.

(ce. ?^?d)1). The divine origin of the dream has been interpreted along lines of an horizontalistic concept of the divine, or, more specifically: the divine in this context would be identified with Xerxes' personal fate (da????) : "der Traum benimmt sich mehr wie ein pers?nlicher Daimon, als ein homerischer G?tterbote../' 2). Admittedly Euri- pides gives evidence of such an internalizing of the idea of god, and Herakleitos calls a man's character his da???? (???? ?????p? da????)3) ; Aristotle dismisses the 'vertical' dimension in a dream's divine origin, and seems to 'horizont alise' this origin by saying that dreams are da?????a, as human nature is in general 4). However, Herodotos' formulae for the divine origin, as collected above, do not allow of a horizontal interpretation of ?e??? (psychological immanentism in theology) ; on the other hand, they are vague enough to be dis- tinguishable from the mythological Homeric names for a dream's origin 5). 'Adieu' bieten . . . Als ein solches stehendes Epitheton geleitet das Wort Helden und Herrscher, S?nger und Seher durch die Literatur". 4) W. P?tscher's definition is: "das einzelne, unerkl?rliche, ungew?hn- liche und schicksalhaft-m?chtige Geschehen", not 'Heaven' or 'das G?tt- liche' (art. cit., 5, note 3). He does not mention the present passage. 1) Nilsson (Geschichte, I, 760) remarks, strangely enough: "bezeichnend ist, dass Herodot nicht sagt, wer den Traum gesandt hat". The divine origin is not only indicated, but even proved; t?? ?e?? pa?ad?d??t?? can only mean in this context: "since the godhead orders the enterprise", rather than "since the godhead provides you with everything". 2) Thus H.

The question may be asked: does the same dream also be- come Artabanos' da????, when it appears to him ? 4) Aristot. De div. p. somn. 462 b-464 b. 5) J. A. S.Evans, Cl. J. 57 (1961), 109-111, assumes an alternative meaning of the dream by taking it as the voice of the Persian ?????, rather than as the voice of 'fate' ("one of the most overworked ideas in the criticism of Greek tragedy"): "... if Xerxes does not make his Greek campaign, he will be changing the ????? of Persia (i.e. to be at war: cf. VII 8) radically, and thereby endangering himself and his empire, for these ????? have made Persia into a great imperialist state" (no). "What drives him into an act of hybris is not his fate, but the ????? of Persia"; "... for the Persian king, changing the ????? is not so easy" (in). The strong emphasis on the character of the dream does not favour this alternative understanding, unless, again,</page><page sequence="15">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 239 On the other hand, I share W. P?tscher's view that the formulae used are suggestive of a divine cause of the Persian war (and, consequently, I think, also of their signs), which to Herodotos' mind goes far beyond "den Wirkungsbereich eines individuellen Gottes" : it is "kein beschr?nktes Individuum des anthropomorphen G?tter- himmels, sondern der Gott schlechthin". The words t? ?e??? and ?e??? (2?), used in this crucial stage of Herodotos' story, may even suggest the idea of god, which P?tscher qualifies as originally Herodotean: "ein Begriff des G?ttlichen als Produkt einer Re- flexion..., der aus dem auf (?) ?e?? oder die mythischen G?tter zur?ckgef?hrten Geschehen abstrahiert worden ist" ?). There is no reason why on the one hand the premisses of Arta- banos' dream-vision?particularly the rational ones? should be qualified as 'Greek', while on the other hand their conclusion that the dream comes from god should be ascribed to Artabanos only. I am inclined to regard this as Greek, and even as Herodotean. h. The literary situation of the story The triple dream-appearance functions as the finale of the Persian summit-conference on the eve of the dramatic struggle be- tween East and West. All the reasonable pros of the expedition are blown up, all the cons blown down by the dream. Mardonios draws Xerxes' attention to Hellas and gambles on his innate ambition and greed: c. 5. The Aleuads and the Peisistratids from Thessaly call in Xerxes' help against Hellas : c. 6. Onomakritos stirs up the Persian court against Hellas with a selection of oracles : c. 6. Behind all this is self-interest. The final conference?perhaps deliberately resembling the as- sembly of the gods in Homer?is a tug of war between Mardonios and Artabanos for Xerxes : "der K?nig in der Mitte zwischen seinem Warner und seinem Verf?hrer", as K. Reinhardt puts it 2). Xerxes propounds his plans for the bridging of the Hellespont and an one was entitled to identify ?e??? and ?????.

For him the motive of revenge is of secondary importance. Mardonios' main motive for the expedition is retaliation and he does not think much of the Greek resistance: c. 9. Artabanos has the heart to attempt to dissuade Xerxes from the enterprise, first of all for material reasons: the Hellenic force should indeed be taken seriously, and dependence on a bridge carries special risks with it; and secondly for a theological reason : the simple fact of human greatness is sufficient reason for the gods to destroy it : c. 9. According to him revenge can be taken just the same. Xerxes, in spite of a burst of anger at first, is left without a final decision. Deliberation during the night makes him share Artabanos' views. This is followed by the dream, which, like a ?e?? ?? ???a??? overrides all rational deliberation. Herodotos' aim in inserting the motive of "the conversion of a hesitant king" is, in W. Aly's words: "den Krieg als Schicksalswillen der freien Be- stimmung des Menschen entziehen"... "Das widerspricht dem Motiv des Kriegsrates, der ja mit guten, recht menschlichen Gr?nden den Krieg gut geheissen hatte" *). A literary idealisation of the Persian war was given in the Persai by Aischylos?perhaps inspired by Phrynichos' "excursions in recent history", from which titles like Persai, Sack of Miletus, and Phoinissai have come down to us 2). An exhaustive comparison of Aischylos' and Herodotos' dramatisation of the events is outside the scope of this study. I only cite a few interesting details : Herodotos ascribes the r?le of the wise adviser, played in the Persai by Dareios, to Artabanos. Their advice is in both cases at the same time a theological interpretation of the situation. In the Persai the doom hanging over the Persian enterprise is announced in an enigmatical oracle 3), while Herodotos' version makes the repeated dream pro- nounce the doom. ?) W.

Herodotos shifts the responsibility for the dream-intermezzo from himself with the words: ??? and ?????eta? ?p? ?e?s??? (c. 12). This, however, does not alter the fact that the dramatic setting and the chresmic type and the theoretical and practical entourage of the dream are designed in the Greek manner. The ?e?? ?? ???a??? on the failure of human deliberation?a procedure whereby a particular motivation is guaranteed by god?is also found in Aischylos' Hepta, where Polyneikes gets enthusiastic about his plan via a dream x) ; in the Choephoroi too Orestes thinks he receives via a dream of Klytaimnestra a divine imperative favouring his plan to murder his mother 2). In all these cases the dream overrides sensible delibera- tion, and in all three cases this is the main offence, not the action itself. H. R. Immerwahr 3) specifies the Greek features in the dream- story: the ??d?a ???a? te ?a? e?e?d?a; the (Homeric) flying away of the dream; "einige der Raisonnements des Artabanos". Oriental motives he sees in the change of garments?which is not certain, after what we said above about ritual disguises within the Greek cult 4)?and also in the appearance of a chief adviser to the king. That here a dream functions and not an oracle, is, in Immerwahr's opinion, not to be taken as an orientalism 5). This sounds more con- vincing than the view of K. Reinhardt 6), who in addition to the exchange of dress also calls the king's dream, with its climax of repetition, and the resulting change of mood, Persian, though he remarks that with the wonder-story Herodotos "auch um seines eigenen Plans willen die welthistorische Entscheidung in der Kl?glichkeit ihrer Fatalit?t vor Augen f?hren will", and though he remarked before, "dass die Schichten reinlich voneinander abzuhe- ben nicht mit Sicherheit gelingt" ...

In his opinion a Persian divine messen- ger and a Greek 'Schicksalsd?mon' have been blended in this story of the king's dream. He does not specify the origin of chapter 16 any further. H. Klees *) in his search for differences between Greek and non-Greek manticism pushes the Persian element in VII 12-19 a little far. Besides the Persianisms, listed by Reinhardt, he mentions : the unambiguous nature of the order; the repetition of the same mantic device in the same matter; the Teira-Haltung' of Xerxes; the opinion that the godhead can be induced to send the same dream to somebody else in order to prove the authenticity of the revelation ; the idea that the godhead can be deceived : all these he regards as so many Persianisms 2). In our discussion of the magic ritual we have given a few paral- lels of dreams by proxy collected from Greek literature ; of means of ?) O.e., 56-59. Klees also defines the characteristics of the Greek belief in oracles and seers from the attitude of Greeks and non-Greeks to dreams. In Herodotos it strikes him that the dreams of non-Greeks are clear and une- quivocal. However, to him a dream is clear even when it reveals only part of the truth (I 34). To the dream of Kambyses (III 30 sqq.), obscure on ac- count of its being homonymous, Klees attributes 'Klarheit des gemeinten Sinnes'. That furthermore it would appear from the dreams in Herodotos that the non-Greeks are unexegetical with regard to their dreams, is not so clear either. Artabanos (VII 49) remains anxious and thoughtful in spite of the 'clear' dream. Both Astyages and Xerxes consult Magi on the meaning of their dreams. On the other hand, Hippias (VI 107) chooses from his ??p?? the meaning which suits him. The contrast between exegetical and non- exegetical attitudes towards dreams seems an ethical rather than a national distinction. Furthermore, no mention is made of the dreams of Polykrates' daughter, of Hipparchos, Hippias, Agarist? (Greeks!), and the dream - orders to the Persians Otanes, Datis and Xerxes (VIII 54). We must pose the question whether the 'interpretatio Graeca', with which Herodotos chiefly handles religious data, does not require knowledge of contemporary Greek dream-facts to decide what is Greek and what exotic, rather than knowledge of non-Greek dream-facts. Finally I quote Marg's observation: "Die Grund- konzeption des Xerxesbildes als herodoteisch, entgegen ?. Reinhardts These von der persischen Tradition in Herodotos' XerxeserZ?hlung (Von Werken und Formen, 1948, 209 sqq.) behandelt die ungedruckte Kieler Dissertation meines Sch?lers Eberhard Hermes: DieXerxesgestalt bei Herodot, 1951" (W. Marg, Herodot ?ber die Folgen von Salamis, Hermes 81, 1953, 204, note 2). 2) Frisch, o.e., 15, referring to Oppenheim's study on Oriental dreams, recognises an oriental feature in Xerxes' sudden awakening and jumping out of bed.</page><page sequence="19">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 243 furthering true dreams by magic or forcing them in incubation ; of the 'agere personam dei (r?gis)'. We have also pointed out that the rationalistic reduction of the dream?which H. Klees does call Greek?is connected with a belief in the divine significance of ex- ceptional dreams, notably those dreams which repeat themselves e?a???? in the dreamer himself. Artabanos only rejects the royal status as a condition of significant dreams, and consequently the exchange of dress. Prophetic unambiguous dreams are frequent in Greek literature: Horn. II. II 6; XXIII 65 sqq.; Od. IV 796; VI 20; Pind. Pyth. IV 159 sqq. ; Olymp. XIII 67 sqq. ; so many pieces of advice received in the incubation-dream; the ?at' ??a?-inscriptions on voti ve-offerings; Plato's remark on 'wild' growth of cult, via man's dreams: Leg. 909 E-910 A; Epin. 985 C. Furthermore, also in VII 12 sqq. there is no 'repetition' of a mantic device: the dream appears twice on its own accord, and a mantic device is used only once, and besides, the dream evidently appears in spite of the device. The repetition of horrifying dreams does not only occur with Io, in Aisch. Prom. 640 sqq., but also with Klytaimnestra in Aisch. Choeph. 32 sqq., and with Atossa in Aisch. Pers. 176 sqq. (whose dream is also seen through Greek eyes!). Lastly it is questionable whether Xerxes' attempt at calling up the dream again can be put on a level with the typically barbarian pe??a-attitude, finding ex- pression for example in Kroisos' preliminary investigation of diverse Greek oracles. For Xerxes' ordering a private incubation does not originate in initial scepticism as to his dream, but from his great confidence in his dream of royal status. Consequently there seems to be no sufficient reason to qualify only the rationalistic ex- planation as Greek. In my opinion the whole opening of the Graeco-Persian drama is conceived in the Graeco-tragic manner. In the dream-discussion only primitive religious elements are to be distinguished as against Ionian enlightened but nevertheless religious elements. I am in- clined to agree on the whole with Aly, who establishes that in the story of the factual events the chapters 12-18 inclusive are super- fluous: "19 schliesst an 11 glatt an und hat wohl auch irgendwo und irgendwann einmal daran angeschlossen". He goes on to suggest ?after establishing that the dream-story in chapter 19 has no</page><page sequence="20">244 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY significance at all?that the Artabanos-scene (12-18, incl.) and the dream of Xerxes might be regarded as doublets, existing in the tradition of the events, and meant to suggest the same idea. Aly concludes: "Dann liegt der Verdacht nahe ... dass die einfachere Form des dritten Traumes der Leitfadenerz?hlung angeh?rt, w?hrend in der Artabanosszene der gegebene Gedanke von Hdt. frei ausgef?hrt ist, vielleicht erst nachtr?glich" x). Whether chapter 16, i.e. Artabanos' criticism of Xerxes' proposal, is to be traced back to the same source as the rest of the story, is doubtful, not only because of the contrast between the psychological reduction of the dream as well as Artabanos' purer idea of religion and the dream-superstition and magic with Xerxes, but also, as I said before, because of a remarkable change in terminology for dream and dream-experience. Is it perhaps Herodotos himself speaking here ? Not only to give an extra dramatic turn to his story, but also to say?indirectly via a speech by a wise man?what he thinks of dreams ? The fact that he makes the Nestor-like wise Artabanos act as p??s?p?? for this piece of theology of history?as Solon does for the Kroisos-story, and Dareios in Aischylos' Persai? is also a valuable pointer in this direction. For it has been established that Herodotos often uses wise counsellors?typically oriental figures?as his mouth-piece 2). A comparison could be made with the manner in which Euripides weaves his criticisms into his tragedies 3). i) Aly, o.e., 168-170. Cf. p. 250, note ?. Aly takes only the Agarist?- dream (VI 131) to be an invention of Herodotos. 2) See R. Lattimore, The Wise Adviser in Herodotos, Class. Philol. 34 (1939), 24-36; he qualifies Artabanos as the 'tragic warner'. H. Bischoff (Der Warner bei Herodot, in: Marg. o.e., 302 sqq.) : "Herodot hat die Eigenheit, Sentenzen und Urteile, die ihm sicher pers?nlich wertvoll scheinen und am Herz liegen, nicht selbst zu verk?nden, sondern sie jemand in den Mund zu legen" (p. 310). H. Klees (o.e., 63, note 193, and 66) quotes U. H?lscher for the view that it is typically non-Greek to take an oracle in its most obvious sense ("das v?llige Fehlen der exegetischen Haltung gegen?ber den Orakel- Spr?chen"). If this also holds good for the dream, Artabanos shows the Greek moral attitude to the dream, for he remains full of anxiety. But is it not precisely "das v?llige Fehlen der exegetischen Haltung", which charac- terises Iphigeneia and Orestes with regard to their dream and oracle in Euripides' Iphigeneia in Tauris ? 3) For example the nurse in his Hippolytos and the messenger in his Helena, 744 sqq.</page><page sequence="21">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 245 With a variant J. Vogt's general assertion may also apply here: "dass in der Darstellung persischer (or even so-called Persian) Einrichtungen eine indirekte Kritik hellenischer Sitten ge?bt wird' 'x). That would also enable us to explain the remarkable fact that Artabanos mentions only ???t? and vestments 2) and not ?????? ; only the former two were known in Greek incubation. W. Burkert's observation is even more specific: "zumal Herodotos bringt in der Schilderung der Barbaren manches, was er in bezug auf Griechen bewusst verschweigt" 3), as for instance the ban on beans and the story of the Egyptian masterthief, paralleled respectively by the Pythagorean ban, and the cult legend of Trophonios and Agamedes. H. Diller formulates the same principle in a more abstract way: "Die kritische ?usserung kleidet sich ... in die Form der naiven Beschreibung eines von aussen gesehenen Vorgangs, dessen Pro- blematik demjenigen, der ihn sonst ohne Nachdenken vollzieht, durch diese unvoreingenommene Beschreibung deutlich gemacht werden soll" 4). Our conclusion is : if Herodotos really speaks his mind here, we are justified in saying that normally he reduces the dream to free- wheeling of intense activity in the daytime, but that in exceptional cases, in which the dream repeats itself and possesses a special e????e?a, he acknowledges the divine origin of the dream 5). ?) J. Vogt, Herodot in ?gypten, in: Marg, o.e., 427. Cf. Her. I 131, 1, where Persian nature-worship is played off against Greek anthropomorphism. 2) Crahay (o.e., 222, note 7) suggests that ???t? does not appear in Xerxes' order and formulae for its execution. But 15, 3 (and 17, 1 ) contradicts this assertion. Though Herodotos introduces Artabanos' objections to the procedure by ??? ???e??e??? ?? t?? ?????? ??es?a? (?6, ?), the throne does not occur in the objection itself. Compare Germain's explanation of the omission of ?????? in Artabanos' criticism : supra, p. 234 3 ) Weisheit und Wissenschaft. Studien zu Pythagoras, Philolaos und Piaton (N?rnberg 1962), 138. 4) In: Entretiens Fondation Hardt, VIII (Gen?ve 1962), 63. See his references. 5) J. Wells (Studies in Herodotus, Oxford 1923, 195) puts "that the nar- rative shows that he (= Herodotos) did not accept the explanation, but that, here as elsewhere, he looked on dreams as revelation from supernatural powers". I comment on this: it is not right to give only half of Artabanos' explanation, and then stamp it as 'rationalistic'. Artabanos actually first gives a normal dream-case and then the criteria which to him constitute the exceptional dream-case. The repetition of the dream puts him in the right.</page><page sequence="22">246 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY j. Religio-ethical implications The question of the part played by the dream in the deliberation on the expedition against Hellas offers an opportunity to make a few theological and ethical annotations, though with regard to our subject they are only of marginal value, and they are only re- lated to one of the many starting-points for inferring Herodotos' theology and ethics x). A god-sent dream, which like a deus ex machina puts an abrupt end not only to the weighing of pros and cons, or an equality of votes, but also to a judicious resolution, seems to justify the con- clusion that the course of human history is evidently mapped out by a blind reality (called god or fate), which, no matter what man's ideas of 'sensible', 'good', 'true' and their opposites are, has its own way, ruthless, merciless. To this blind force in history one cannot apparently ascribe either truth or He, reward or punishment, nor the will to cause a man's success or downfall. He (or 'it') is simply beyond these anthropomorphic predicates 2). The vertical intercourse of this god-fate and man is confined respectively to the 'eructation' of obscure and inadequate signs, one of which is the dream, and the conscientious reception of these always multivalent signs?which is religion and the primary criterion for ethos. The reception and scrupulous interpretation of the signs is the vertical, transcendent orientation in man's ethical attitude?an orientation, for which we will reserve the word 'moral', in contrast with 'ethical', with which we will indicate the horizontal element. This vertical orientation in man's ethical attitude cannot be defined as 'doing God's will', for materially this 'will' is never there. Nor is Therefore my opinion is that Herodotos indeed accepts Artabanos' explana- tion of the dream, yet at the same time the revealing character of some dreams. In the same work, p. 95-1 n, Wells tries to identify Herodotos' Persian source with Zopyros, a nephew of Xerxes and the son of a general. He came to Athens about 480. In Van Groningen's opinion (Comm. vol. 5, 6) the story goes back to a Persian source, or at least to one kindly disposed towards the Persians, but in the speeches he finds strongly Greek-coloured thoughts. 1) The ideas and material here come mostly from J. Kirchberg, Die Funktion der Orakel im Werke Herodots (G?ttingen 1965), 31-32; 87-90. 2) See p. 227, note 2.</page><page sequence="23">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 247 the formula 'submitting to fate' any better, for this fate always remains obscure. Only the scrupulous, ever repeated interpretation of obscure signs is sufficiently expressive of this vertical moment. Its opposite, i.e., insensibility or even obduracy towards the signs, is ?????. Sensibility to the signs from the 'god-fate' might be called s?f??s???, but since the fearful interpretation of irrational signs plays such an important part in it, this s?f??s??? is closer to de?s?da?????a x) than to f????s??, so that the most important (set of) ideas in ethics, as suggested by Herodotos in the story under dis- cussion, might be de?s?da?????a and ?????2). Fear (anxiety) is ?) See also H. Bolkestein, Theophrastos' Charakter der Deisidaimonia, Rel.-gesch. Vers, und Vorarb. XXI, 2 (Giessen 1929), 3-11. The word de?s?da???? first appears in Xenophon. Thus P. Koets, ?e?s?da?????a (diss. Utrecht 1929), 6-8; Xenophon qualifies Agesilaos as de?s?da????, a quality which is motivated by ??????? t??? ??? ?a??? ???ta? ??p? e?da????a?, t??? d? e???e?? tete?e?t???ta? ?d? ?a??????? (Ages. 11, 8). So also here de?s?da???? proves to be the attitude opposite to self-assuredness, an attitude which receives a positive description in Ages. 1, 27: ?e??? s??e??; 3, 2: ta ?e?a ?s??et? ; ??, 2 : Agesilaos is a pa?ade???a of a ?e?se??? man. In the Kyropaideia (III 3, 58) the qualification de?s?da???? is used with reference to starting the pa???a t?? ???????e??? and joining in them ?e?se???. So here the term ap- pears to refer to the observance of the ???????e?a; de?s?da????e? in critical circumstances are less afraid of men, adds Xenophon. For this attitude Euripides (Iph. Taur. 268) uses the word ?e?se???, in contrast to a????a ??as?? (v. 275). In his Hipparchikos (IX 8-9) Xenophon states explicitly why he has so often used the formula s?? ?e? p??tte??. Because in critical situations all depends on the advice of the gods, given in all sorts of signs, among which he mentions dreams. Furthermore Xenophon is of the opinion that the gods prefer to give this advice to people who ?e?ape??s?? . . . t??? ?e???. Here again we find a rejection of self-assuredness and a searching for signs via religious practice : observance of the ?????. Herodotos may be less anthropomorphic in his religious and ethical ideas than Xenophon, and less optimistic about the influence of the observance of the ????? on the signs from above, but their practical (not dogmatic) religious attitudes resem- ble each other very much in this searching for signs of the gods out of a conviction of a deficiency and in respect for the ???????e?a, also those of the enemy (XI 1-2). To us therefore it is quite justifiable to characterize Hero- dotos' ethical-religious attitude?as this emerges from the texts we studied? with Xenophon's de?s?da?????a. Xenophon is considered a "representative of an old-fashioned type of piety". 2) With Aischylos insensibility to divine signs is hypostatized into "?ta (Pers. 99), caused by a da???? (v. 724). Man can only precipitate what the godhead has decided. Cf. Kirchberg, o.e., 90, note ?.</page><page sequence="24">248 A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY frequently mentioned in this story: cc. 15, 1; 18, 1; 47, 2; 50; 51,1. It seems that one ought to be de??at?? ?p?p?e??, as contrasted with self-assured. Sokrates' anxious trying out of the oracle regarding himself, given to Chairephon, should perhaps also be understood as a highly moral de?s?da?????a. In this light too Xerxes' moral attitude is correct, when he took the divine sign seriously, unlike Artabanos who kept to rational considerations; but Artabanos proves that he possesses the proper moral attitude when he contin- ues his anxious scanning of the future even after the dream, and in spite of Xerxes' self-confidence and precipitance. Xerxes' insensibi- lity to signs or his self-conceited interpretation also appears in c. 19, where he explains a dream in his favour; in c. 37, where he accepts the flattering interpretation of the eclipse; in c. 43, where he gives no heed to panic; in c. 57, where he disregards very strange por- tents. The secondary criterion for measuring the ethos of a deed remains rather in the background here, but in III 16 and 38 it proves to be a historical and social criterion : the ?????, in the sense of territorially sacred tradition in matters of cult and morals. The ????? of the territory demand strict observance; the ????? of others ask for tolerance; who conforms to them is 'good', who does not is 'bad', but this 'ethical' (in contrast with 'moral') viewpoint has only a horizontal, historical, human validity: in other words it does not count in the relationship of man with god or vice versa. This ex- plains how ? ?e?? can order Sabakos to commit as??e?a, without the godhead becoming ase??? himself. Obedience to the order would only make Sabakos ?se??? (Her. II 139). 'The will of god' is never the projection or canonisation of any pattern of human conduct, neither has any pattern of conduct descended from heaven. Not heaven, but history and society are the founts of ethical attitude and conduct. Or, in other words : the ????? owe their validity only to their long standing and general acceptance, and only among men. Since moral and ethical conduct is urged by the same power, conflicts are possible. For deeds which are good in accordance with the ?????, and deeds which are bad according to the same norm, can both be hybristic, i.e. without fear of and attention to doom. This imprudence and blindness can be caused not only by am-</page><page sequence="25">A DREAM ON ? ?????S OF HISTORY 249 bition, lust of revenge or power, but also by youth, the 'sacred disease', and even by a sharp reasonable insight into the situation 1). Thus Artabanos' good and sensible advice is immoral, because it ignores doom. Mykerinos, who by means of an ethical reign wanted to refute an oracle saying there was to be an unjust reign, was morally wrong, despite his 'ethical' justice2). On the other hand, characters in tragedy, like Orestes, Polyneikes, Oidipous?and also Kroisos?are 'morally' good, because they are specimens of anxious attention to their doom, known to them via oracle or dream, though in view of the ????? they are totally 'un-ethical'. From this it follows that from a vertical (moral) standpoint man is only responsible for the way he resigns himself to his doom, in fear or self-assuredness ; from a horizontal (ethical) point of view, as with regard to polis and tradition, he is also responsible for his deeds themselves. Or concretely : neither Xerxes nor Artabanos are guilty of the bridging of the Hellespont and the defeat: they are only guilty through their ?????, permanent in Xerxes and caused by his imperialism, transient in Artabanos and caused by his human wisdom. This difference makes Xerxes the hybristic hero and Artabanos the tragic one. Does Herodotos suggest that man al- ways finds himself in this dilemma, i.e. between the devil and the deep sea? Human tragedy consisting in thinking and re-thinking on the one hand, and the impossibility of shaping reality according to this knowledge on the other, is beautifully expressed by the Persian who was invited for dinner by the Greek Attaginos shortly before the battle of Plataiai: ????st? d? ?d???
