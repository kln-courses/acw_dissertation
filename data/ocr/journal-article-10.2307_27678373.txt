<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guided Reading Programme What is God? Introduction (pp. 1-10) Gabriel Daly This is a very short book on a very large subject. It needs to be read slowly, for it is deceptively simple. The author, John Haught, is asking his readers to look in perhaps unfamiliar directions for evidence of the presence of God. His title 'What is God?' is very deliberate. As he remarks, 'For most theists, at least, it seems more natural to ask "who" God is' (p. 1). In short, our immediate idea of God is personal. Whatever else God is, we feel, he cannot be less than the best we discover in our own human lives. Now the best we discover in human life has to do with personal relationships. We therefore think of God as, above all, a person who relates to us in ways which are altogether special, yet somehow similar to the best of our human relationships. Scripture instructs us to think of God as 'Father' (an image which is admittedly in some trouble as a result of feminist insights); 'Shepherd' (an image which depends for its effect upon a realiza tion of how the ancient oriental shepherd related to his flock); 'Husband' (an image which depends on a deeply Jewish conception of the close relationship between Israel and Yahweh - to say nothing of its conception of marriage); and so on. In every case our image of God is borrowed from intimate human relationships. What happens, however, when our experience of these relation ships is, for one reason or another, seriously flawed? Human fathers and husbands are, in most cases, by no means perfect. The marriage relationship is differently perceived in different cultures. Yet we all have some idea or vision of what an ideal father, hus band, or marriage should be. This we project upon God in an effort to represent to ourselves who God is and how he relates to his creatures. Haught therefore calls on us, not to reject personal analogies, but instead temporarily to employ neuter analogies which trans cend gender and which touch depths in us which are not immedi Gabriel Daly is an Augustinian priest of the Irish Province.

He hopes thereby to evoke in us certain resonances which familiarity with the word 'God' may have stifled or never have allowed to come to consciousness. Our ancestors at some point in their journey into full humanness felt the presence of an unseen world. They represented that unseen world to themselves by stories and symbols. Note the important paragraph (pp. 2-3) beginning with the words 'The idea of God . . .', where the author reminds us that, historically, myths and symbols preceded abstract thinking about God. He remarks that in these myths and symbols we may have 'an ever renewable plenitude of meaning'. In other words they have a perennial effect which no degree of sophistication can remove. It would be a great mistake to think that we today are sophisticates who have 'progressed' from myth to learned discourse and can now afford to discard our inherited myths. Our myths remain exceedingly important, because they speak to our imagination and our subconscious in a way that abstract concepts cannot do. However, we must also strive to think about God, and so Haught asks if the word 'God' can have a universal meaning which takes into account universal human experience and not just the experi ence of people who are normally considered to be 'religious'. Instead of beginning from a God 'out there' we are being asked to reflect upon our own deepest experiences as realities which may suggest to us what it means to speak of God. Attending to the neuter as distinct from the personal may help us to free ourselves, if necessary, from the image of the tyrannical ring-master so often presented and exploited down the ages by Christian teachers and preachers. We are asked to look within ourselves for signs of 'the divine'. Paradoxically we may find that thinking about 'the divine' can actually bring God closer to us than representing him to ourselves in supra-human personal images which are all too easily flawed by our meanness of spirit, hostility, aggressiveness, jealousy, and, perhaps above all, by our (often unconscious) desire to control others. The word 'anthropomorphism' means mentally attributing human characteristics to God, on the one hand, and to non-human beings (animals, toys), on the other. Some degree of anthropomor phism is necessary - and beneficial, as long as we know what we are doing. The sort of thinking Haught is asking of us may encourage us to deepen our apprehension of God by making us heed the words of St Augustine which I quoted last month. 'If you are far from yourself, how can you draw near to God?'</page><page sequence="3">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 719 PROJECT Consider this sentence from p. 8 of our book: 'There is a strong temptation in all historical religions to reduce their notions of God to manageable anthropomorphic proportions for the sake of easy access to and even control of deity.' Beginning from childhood memories, such as 'God will punish you if you do that', list further instances where the image of God has been exploited for all too human ends, especially those associ ated with power. Disturbing The Peace, chapter 2 Vincent MacNamara Our image of Jesus Christ may have lain unexamined in the attics of our minds and hearts for a long time. We might begin by asking where we got it. It is probably a composite job, snatches from childhood stories, from school, missions, sermons, books - the infant in the crib, the moral teacher, the judge, the Crucified one of the Stations of the Cross, the infant of Prague, the Sacred Heart, Hunt's figure of the one who stands at the door and knocks. I don't know. It was inevitable that the gospel image would have been touched up by persuasive journeymen through the centuries. What Disturbing The Peace challenges us to do is to look at and listen to the Jesus of the gospels. In this chapter the questions are thrown insistently and awkwardly at us to shake our complacency: who is this man Jesus; what does he do; why is he; what does he communicate in word and work; what does he ask? What are we to make of one who takes the old theme of the kingdom and recasts it? How are we to respond to one who dares to make the breakthrough to ? God who is 'Abba'? We are invited by him to enter into his perspective. That means shifting the focus of our lives, as he did, from ourselves to Abba and his purposes. It might be useful to ask ourselves about our focus, about the source of our energies. I read this in a Saul Bellow book of short stories the other day: The emotional struggles of mankind were never resolved. The same things were done over and over, with passion, with pas sionate stupidity, insectlike, the same emotional struggles in Vincent MacNamara is a priest of St Patrick's Missionary Society, Kiltegan.

From where, out of where, do we live our lives? Is it from ourselves and our frantic efforts to prove or promote or defend ourselves? Or is life, as it was for Jesus, some kind of surrender to the source of life and love, to Abba? There is in the chapter a strong suggestion that if we take the very langauge forms of Jesus seriously they will revolutionize our lives, because he chooses forms that are calculated to upset - quixotic, paradoxical. One of the questions about Christianity these days is whether it has anything of bite. I do not mean the bite of an institu tion that will ravage anybody who would question its traditional power and patterns. But whether it has anything to say that will illumine and shape and enhance human life in the raw towns where we live. People trot out glib remarks about Christian values (well, they must in some sense be Christ-values - so what were they?), a Christian society etc. What does this kind of talk mean: are we really only saying what the good humanist is saying rather better? The 1975 statement of Pope Paul VI, Evangelization in the Modern World, spoke of Jesus and his message as affecting the standards by which people make judgments, their prevailing values, their interests and thought-patterns, the things that move them to action, and their mdoels of human living; in so far as any or all of these are inconsistent with the Word of God and the plan of salvation they are to be in some sense turned upside down by the power of the gospel (trans. D. Dorr, Option for the Poor). That is a different story and you see something of it in the prover bial sayings (pp. 26-7). Forget the picture in the attic and allow yourself to be confronted by the gospel. Who is this man with his sayings that go 'far beyond common sense, balanced judgment, and the accumulated wisdom of the ages' (p. 28)? He is certainly a disturber of the peace - our peace. We might well feel like the possessed one in the gospels who pleaded with him to go away. We may be even more sharply challenged by the upside do wnness of the parables. What if you were a priest or l?vite or any Jew listening as Jesus quietly (mischievously?) dropped the explosive words of the Good Samaritan parable into the midst of his hearers? All you ever thought about your security and impor tance, all you ever heard from your elders about election, salvation, Church would be in bits. If you had been around a while with Jesus your mind would surely flash to another day when he wrote in the sand and the respectable churchmen who were so sure that they knew the ways and will of God had to slink shamefacedly away.</page><page sequence="5">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 721 Disturbed certainly. Wiser? Closing their hearts to it? Or allowing in the chink of light? A troublesome man, Jesus of Nazareth. And yet there were those who even then had the suspicion that he had it right - that it is only in losing one's old life-style that one finds real life. It seems to be the case that it is only when the cosy and carefully-spun cocoon of our lives is shattered that the light can come. Not just economically and socially - that too - but even psychologically. It is when the satisfied citadel of our ego-schemes has been breached by loss, hurt, rejection, fear that we are ready for the kingdom. Blessed are the poor and those who suffer and those who are persecuted and rejected and those who do not count because the Kingdom of God is at hand. A life of discipleship becomes a real option. 1. Have you found the source(s) of your image of Jesus? Is anything happening to it as you read this book? 2. What do you make of the expressions 'Christian values'/'a Christian society'/'gospel values'? 3. How do you find the 'Abba' language? What do you think of the remark that the God-language of Israel had masculine and feminine overtones (p. 29)? What masculine and feminine images do you have of God?</page></plain_text>
