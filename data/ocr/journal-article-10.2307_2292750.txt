<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER XV ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE WOLFGANG S. SEIFERTH DEFINING THE SUBJECT AS TO ESSENCE AND STRUCTURE The history of the Jews in Europe furnishes the classic example of the minority problem. It fully demon- strates the complex character of racial, religious, national, and cultural pre- dicaments that is so typical for minor- ities. It arose on a continental-wide scope in ancient times yet the official history of whole centuries has passed it over in silence. Today it causes, and will cause, world-wide repercussions no matter what turn the events will take. The events of this history are of distinctly double nature allowing, thus, a deeper insight into human ways and historic laws than many other fields of historic research. First, these events present themselves as facts of a physical nature. They are done to a group of people (as the word fact suggests). They determine, from then on, completely the lives of these people and eventually create conditions of an outlawed and segregated existence. Second, these facts are of a greater significance than their limited physical category may indicate. Since they are imposed upon this minority from with- out, they are a definite symptom of a disturbed balance within the whole body, within a nation, within a civili- zation, or, even within mankind as such, if indeed the issue should as- sume-as it seems to-suchtremen- dous proportions. Thus the history of the Jews in Europe always has been a barometer showing and even fore- casting with statistical accuracy the rise and the fall of freedom, peace, and tolerance, and of their respective ad- versaries. Any single event in this his- tory become, thus, of spiritual signifi- cance. According to the complex char- acter of the matter any single event will reflect not only purposeful poli- tical or economical moves, but intel- lectual and even religious develop- ments as well. The fate of a minority cannot be separated from that of the ruling majority nation, however pow- erful efforts to that end may be made, and it will cast its shadow over the continent of Europe long after these efforts seem to have succeeded com- pletely. The present day conditions of our subject are dealt with in other contri- butions to this Yearbook. These con- tributions, by way of a cross-section, shed light on the recent past and on the immediate future of our problem, on the yesterday and on the tomorrow, and they will admit all the conclusions as to the inner life and the balance of the whole, as outlined above. Yet a cross-section is not the only approach to so complex a problem. Jewish history in Europe is the only history of any minority that covers a time span of world-historic propor- tions, of almost two thousand years of unbroken continuity, and thus offers a longitudinal section to the historian who searches for the essence of this development, for the historic substance and for the underlying principles, 466</page><page sequence="2">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 467 though he may disregard for a while the details and the various modifica- tions that dominate the view at a closer range. Just as the problem of the American Negroes cannot be solved merely by the insight into so- cial, political, and racial facts (im- portant and indispensable as this insight is) but can be solved only if and when the white people recognize and acknowledge the historic respon- sibility that has necessarily grown from exploitation and slavery, so the substance of the Jewish problem be- comes evident and urgent from an analysis of its history. History reveals the ethical substance of minority prob- lems, and only this substance may in- duce the majority to act not merely according to naked self-interest, but along lines of tolerance, cooperation, and reciprocity. The history of the Jews in Europe, as a field of research, has been ap- proached by Jewish and Christian scholars likewise, and with an appre- ciable degree of objectivity, since the middle of the 19th century. The multi- tude of these studies', the diligence and the efforts invested in them may suggest that these scholars not only devoted themselves to the service of historic truth, but that they likewise felt the ethical implications of truth. In some contributions from the Chris- tian side even a move of conscience is distinctly noticeable: they do not elude the painful insight into the aberrations of sophistry and the abuses of organized religion. In an age of relatively independant research 1 To list only names: H. Graetz, Aronius, Abrahams, L. Brentano, M. Weber, I. v. Doel- linger, F. Gregorovius; and collective publica- tions like the Jewish Encyclopedia, 12 vols. 1905 Sf.-Juedisches Lexikon, 5 vols., 1927 fif. and thought, as we may come to con- sider the past century, these scholars hoped to prevent, by means of enlight- enment, a reccurence of movements like those which they studied. And to-day, when those noble efforts seem to have altogether failed, their pur- suit appears a duty more than ever before. Many of these studies have, for obvious reasons, emphasized the racial and the economic aspects of the issue. Indeed, the entanglement of these sides of the problem with the purely spirit- ual aspect is almost as old as the prob- lem itself. But one should clearly see that the problem has its roots in the religious nature of the issue: it is, first of all, a subject of religious history; the racial and the economic features in it are only of secondary importance. Without the bond of a creed the Jewish race as such would have hardly sur- vived, but would have been submerged like so many others in the catastrophes of the centuries. An approach from the religious side, a definition of the issue in terms of the history of religion will come closer to the roots than an over- emphasis on national, racial, or eco- nomic facts as given to the issue par- ticularly by political movements of today. There is still another consideration that recommends this approach. The history of the human mind, as well as an elementary psychology, shows that behind many political and economic arguments and movements certain par- ticular impulses are at work that can be traced back to pseudo-religious sources. The fanaticism so evident in many political and economic move- ments is ample proof of this origin. Fanaticism is fear, organized and</page><page sequence="3">468 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION utilized; and fear is certainly one of the most genuine sensations of man out of which magic and primitive re- ligion have grown; and it is evident still in the popular notions and prac- tices of each religion. Fanaticism, no matter whether turning towards na- tional, racial or religious issues, draws its violence and strength from this most genuine sensation in human na- ture. Movements of similar strength, to be sure, may be produced by the plain self-interest of a group or even by smart calculation; such move- ments, however, are usually inclined to compromise just for the sake of self-interest or opportunity. But the uncompromising blind fanaticism, the partisan zealotry, so common today, grows from hidden and ancient layers of the human soul, which, the deeper they are, are the less under control and the more easily aroused and en- flamed. Even fanaticism that pretends to be merely political and would em- phatically deny that origin, is a pseudo-religious attitude. The tech- nique of propaganda and defamation, the picturing in black and white only, the definition of the political opponent in terms of all human vices (regard- less of the true reasons for his opposi- tion) are proof to that and betray a purposeful exploitation of these primi- tive sensations. In order to explain this fanaticism it is not enough to say that the "state" or "nation" or the "north- ern race" has been elevated to the rank of the highest deity. This ex- planation merely rationalizes, for the use of the intellectuals only, that "solid layer of savagery beneath the surface of society" (Sir James Frazer, The Golden Bough). The proof may be seen in the fact that the only serious and enduring resistance to the totali- tarian order has come, and still comes, from sincere and determined represen- tatives of Christianity who strive to free this religion once more from fear (and thereby from superstitions of all kinds) and to restore it on purer ground, even in face of the fact that human nature as such has not changed. ROOTS OF THE PROBLEM With regard to the space available we shall limit our study to two deci- sive periods in the history of our prob- lem, namely, the Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment; trying to re- duce the problem to its essence and structure. Contrary to general belief the Mid- dle Ages proper are not entirely the "dark age" with respect to our prob- lem. The Carolingian age first, then the 10th and 11th centuries were com- paratively peaceful times for the European Jews during which the re- ligious aspect of the problem could be fully developed while the racial issue was not realized at all and the eco- nomic aspect of still more minor im- portance. For these centuries the problem limits itself almost com- pletely to that of the relationship of the Old and the New Testament, i.e., to its strictly religious substance, and it is only temporarily and for reasons to be stated later, that this substance is permeated and falsified by outside factors up to the time when the cru- sades finally bring about the decisive changes. What was, in the judgment of the Middle Ages, the significance of the Old for the New Testament? It arose from the fundamental doctrine that the Old Testament is the indispens-</page><page sequence="4">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 469 able, preparatory foundation of the New Testament. This doctrine is based on Christ's own words; he integrated the sacred traditions of his people into his own teaching by construing those traditions in accordance with his mes- siahship. This fusion and interdepen- dence of the Old and the New is fre- quently referred to in the Gospels, and it resulted in considering both tradi- tions as one unit on the basis of God's successive relations to man. This cor- relation was firmly established in the first Christian century; it got its in- tellectual shape by the patristic au- thors and was valid throughout the Middle Ages. It is often referred to by the phrase of "Concordia Veteris et Novi Testamenti," i.e., an accordance between the two traditions, a harmony in ideas, in events, in characters. A strict parallelism of both Scriptures was developed on the assumption that the important outcomes of the New Testament have been foreshadowed by such of the Old that they were com- prehensible already then like "an im- age reflected in the mirror." The mes- sianic prophecies offered an abundance of such relations, and the Old Testa- ment became gradually a figure of the New. This "Concordia" has been the most inspiring source for the arts in the Middle Ages, sculpture and paint- ing made full use of it, and the ap- parent narrowness of the subject yielded the richest and most extra- ordinary artistic achievements. The "Concordia" offered certain practical directions as to the relation of Christians to Jews. It can be formu- lated about thus: "The death of Christ is not a guilt burdened upon the Jews for ever and ever. The Jews are not definitely repudiated by God, he does not retract his promise. In days to come, when the multitude of heathen has become believers, Israel, too, will do so and-live in harmony and community with the gentiles." Or "The Jews are and remain our brothers who will join us only later, then namelyy when we, by virtue of teach- ing and of a good life, shall have in- spired them to compete with us there- in." These versions, as found in patris- tic authors, imply, first, that Chris- tians and Jews, sub specie eternitatis, are of the same kin as children of God, even if separated temporarily; and, second, that the Christians are not entitled to anticipate the decrees of Heaven by curtailing the freedom of worship of the Jews. The question is: how did this con- cept of the "Concordia," how did the supposed interdependence and unity of the Jewish and the Christian religious traditions affect the actual situation of the Jewish people in Europe? The answer is given in the various condi- tions of religious liberty that were, in most instances, identical with the con- ditions of what we term today civic liberties. These conditions of freedom of religion and worship underwent several changes. In order to describe them we have to specify various periods. The great migration of nations re- sulted in a sort of tolerance, partly out of indifference, partly for the fact that the Teutonic conquerors adhered to Arianism, i.e., to a stronger monothe- ism than that of the official Catholic church of Rome. In the instance of Theodoric the Great (d. 526) it was superior statesmanship that made him grant freedom of religion. He defended the violated civic rights of the Jews in</page><page sequence="5">470 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION the city of Rome against the local Catholic clergy. Remarkable is one sentence in a decree issued for the Jews of Genoa: ". . . we will not order you to believe in Christianity because nobody is forced to do so against his will." The papacy, while still in the beginning of its ascendancy, also took a stand against the arbitrary and en- forced conversion of Jews, and indeed, as far as we can see, out of religious motives and clear principles. We refer particularity to the Pope, Gregory the Great (d. 604), who pronounced the principle that Jews should be con- verted only by means of persuasion and gentleness, but never by force, and he did not cease to impress the prin- ciple of tolerance upon the minds of fanatic bishops and rulers who began to consider the making of proselytes a deed pleasing to God, or made use of it for political reasons. He conscien- tiously protected the Roman citizen- ship granted to the Jews since ancient times: "We forbid to molest the Jews, or to restrict them, as against the es- tablished order; we allow them to live as Roman citizens and to do with their property as they want to; only keep- ing Christian slaves is forbidden to them." He compensated Jewish com- munities for injustice and damage done to them, and he stated time and again, that freedom of religion was granted to them since times imme- morial. He made it likewise clear that the ultimate goal was to win the Jews over to Christianity, he only repudi- ated the coercive methods of zealots and fanatics. Thus his practical policy is a perfect illustration of the "Con- cordia." There, is to be sure, also evidence to the contrary in these centuries; one needs only to look, as for instance, into the records and the legislation of the church of Gaul during the 5th to the 8th century. But characters like Theo- doric and Gregory set the pattern to which the free spirit could look up and appeal to. Freedom of speech and of discussion has been defended or granted even during times of pressure and persecution. Gregory, a bishop of Tours, records a disputation between himself and a learned Jew (around the year 575). This record is of value be- cause it shows that the fundamental issue had not been disturbed yet by interference from without, it was a dis- pute on terms of equality. It clarified the contradictory positions completely. The bishop could not, according to his own account, refute the perseverance and interpretation of his equally learned opponent although he con- fronted him with all the biblical proof of the messiahship of Jesus. It is just the Christian concept of God and sal- vation, and of the divinity of Jesus, that the Jew could not accept. He made these statements: "God does not need to promote his work of salvation by a son born in the flesh; he cannot share his divinity with anyone for there is only one God; and he would not be beaten, humiliated and cruci- fied"-altogether assumptions detract- ing from the spiritual, divine and un- divided character of God as the Jews see it. His strict and rigid monotheism opposes the anthropomorphic messiah- concept of historic Christianity with its miracles and figures. Here we touch upon the genuine nucleus of the con- flict. The Carolingian age has been re- ferred to by Jewish historians as the "Golden Age of the Jews." There is</page><page sequence="6">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 471 much evidence to justify that praise. Charlemagne purposefully made use of the commercial activities in which the Jews in the Mediterranean coun- tries and in Asia Minor were engaged. He encouraged them in his empire to- wards commerce and trade and thus opened his lands to world-wide trade routes. In their commercial activities the Jews were subject only to those restrictions that applied likewise to all merchants. The barriers of social and professional discrimination were widely reduced. Motivated by these opportunities and unmolested by a narrow and doctrinary jurisdiction the Jews of France and the Rhine lands began to spread far into the Eastern provinces of Charlemagne's domain. This movement extended in the follow- ing century as far as Bohemia and be- yond the Elbe river into Slavic territory. Many of these Jews were literate men, versed in several lan- guages, as a consequence of their en- gagement in commerce. These conditions even improved under Charlemagne's successor Louis. His "protective letters," issued to a large number of individual Jews, put them on favorable terms as mer- chants; allowed them to move freely, to own real estate, and even to serve in state functions. The owners of such letters were subject only to the em- peror's jurisdiction throughout the em- pire. In return the Jews had to pay high taxes and "to serve the king faithfully." It is a historic fact that these concessions had a decisive mo- tive in financial considerations. The issue is, however, very complex and has also some other roots of genuinely spiritual nature. They sprang from the "Carolingian Renaissance," from the revival of learning and study under the inspiring initiative of Charlemagne himself. His appreciative and open mind, his purpose-free curiosity and his untiring interest in the life of the spirit as well as in that of the peoples created and promoted a remarkable activity around the court that ex- tended over wider circles of his offi- cialdom and of the clergy. The move- ment was essentially a movement of laymen and showed tendencies to- wards a general education on secular ground, just as, under Charlemagne's rulership, the state law was superior to the canonic law, the pope in Rome being just the first bishop of the em- pire. The most brilliant spirits of Europe gathered at the court and created an intellectual universality and an enlightened atmosphere. The merits of this movement as to science, letters, education, and art have been often emphasized, and they have come down to us visible in a structure so superb and perfect as the Palatial Chapel in Aix-la-Chapelle. It should be seen, too, that this open- moindedness, appreciation of and ob- jectivity to historic and spiritual fea- tures were bound to alleviate the burden of the Jews, and we notice indeed in the foremost representatives of this age a revival of the ancient "Concordia." The Jews had freedom not only to perform their rites unmol- ested, but also to speak freely about their religion and its distinctions in the company of Christians with whom they were allowed to associate. Re- ligious discussions on equal terms could take place and, at such occa- sions, the Jewish religion may have developed a certain missionary power (for we hear of a conversion) just be-</page><page sequence="7">472 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION cause it was not burdened with poli- tical compromises, mistakes, and open misuse as compared with the ruling state religion. The advantage of being a tolerated opposition, without having any material responsibilities, may have worked in some instances to the favor of Judaism. This aspect of the Carolingian age proves that the "Con- cordia" was still a living concept, and not merely an early theological scheme, being still acknowledged and practiced with its consequences. Fore- most among these consequences was the fundamental principle that the contemporary Jews should be toler- ated and respected "as the descen- dants of the Patriarchs and Prophets." The "Concordia," if taken seriously and in its full meaning as a historic truth (in the terms of the age) and as a responsibility, explains the tolerant and undoctrinary attitude of the Carolingian age sufficiently and with justice to either side. TENET VERSUS SPIRIT The picture would be incomplete without presenting the contemporary opposing forces. The movement of Agobard, Bishop of Lyon (d. 840), against the rights conceded to the Jews is the first one (of so many to follow) that can be defined, with a certain degree of plausability, as to origin, significance, and implications. Just as the tolerant attitude of the age had sprung from the philosophical sincerity and the historic justice of the layman, and from that deeper source of religion that supplies man- kind with tolerance and freedom of thought, we observe now that the re- action has its roots in the canonic law, i.e., in those legal principles of organ- ized religion which tended towards a strict and final doctrine, absolute claims and domination of society. And just as that tolerance was assisted and sanctioned by the independent and impartial power of the king, i.e., of the civic authority, we observe now that the reaction against this tolerance comes forth from a church that claims authority over both state and society. Agobard is a distinct forerunner of the later medieval dogmatic period that culminated in the triumph of the pa- pacy over the rulers and peoples of Europe. The conflict arose from the practical and relatively unimportant problem of whether pagan slaves of Jews should be admitted to baptism and thereby become free. The canonic law excluded only Jews from owning bap- tized slaves and thus this measure worked to the disadvantage of Jews only. The "protective letters" had just tried to prevent the open abuse of such a convenient economic weapon. With an abundance of biblical pas- sages Agobard proves fully the "right that even a slave has on God" and of which no social condition can deprive him-a genuine religious principle. Agobard associates this principle and even identifies it with the canonic law, the legacy of a church-dominated so- ciety. That a Jew should not own Christians as slaves nor employ them for pay could not be documented from the Scriptures, yet Agobard claims for this canonic principle the same au- thority as for the Gospels. Thus his position is, from the beginning on, a compromise between the spirit of the teaching and the political implications of his office. His church claims to be identical with God's word. The min- ority issue is shifting from its genuine ground over to the political field where</page><page sequence="8">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 473 it becomes a means among others. We have stated already that the "protec- tive letters" yielded lucrative reve- nues to the court. They were a means, too, but Agobard's countermove, in spite of its pretended air of religion, is not of a higher level. Agobard's writings demonstrate a growing resentment and zeal and seem to be motivated, in an increasing way, by the infallibility of the priest who strives for power. The later writings are full of obvious exaggerations and harsh words agianst the Jews and their friends. He creates the impression that the whole Christian society is about to collapse under the growing insolence and power of the Jews who dominate, as he says, the intellectual, economic, and political life; and even the fash- ions. They insult the Christians, per- secute the church, and blaspheme the Lord. Agobard therefore advocates the strictest enforcement of the older reg- ulations of the church of Gaul with the purpose of complete segregation, and he leaves no doubt that ,in order to realize that end, he has done every- thing that can be done from the pulpit. Agobard stood indeed on legal ground with his demands. The canonic law, as already indicated, had grown under the influence of a doctrinary hierarchy that was as hostile to the Jews; the protective letters and the liberal attitude of the age had only suspended that canonic law. In order to revive it Agobard tried to prove from the Scripture that Jesus him- self repudiated the Jews, indeed an entirely arbitrary conjecture. He then draws mainly from the Acts and letters of the apostles, that is to say from a time when our problem had entered already the stage of open com- petition and conflict between rivalling religions. It is not difficult to find in the Acts the historic evidence of grow- ing enmity between the Jewish com- munities and the Christian converts. Again Agobard interprets these simple historic facts as a basic religious ele- ment, as a valid and final consequence of the teaching of Jesus. He does not discriminate between the religious novelty of Jesus' message and the very human resentment by which the apostles reacted to the natural enmity of the Jews. Agobard feels that he has to take up the cause of the apostles against the Jews once more; he is heir and successor to the apostles and has to execute the sentence pronounced by them. The argument clearly has fore- saken the genuine religious realm, it has become a concern of the "Church triumphant." It is hard to distinguish, in that phraseology, the religious sin- cerity from the will to power, to tell justice from revenge. The idea that the Jews are responsible for the death of Christ and are to be punished for it, is not pronounced yet, but such a conclu- sion could easily be drawn. The highly intellectual opposition of the Jews to the concept of death and resurrection of Christ (probably often and freely discussed in certain circles, and indeed a logical critique if one has no share in that specific Christian concept) be- comes, in the eyes of the bishop, a persecution by the Jews, menacing the very existence of Christianity, an in- sulting challenge that has to be met by means of complete and efficient segregation. History does not know much about the actual success of Agobard's move- ment. His spirit was kept alive by his successors. We hear of enforced bap- tism of Jews in South France around the middle of the ninth century. As a</page><page sequence="9">474 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION whole, the peaceful times for the Jews were still enduring and extended to the Mohammedan states in Spain. This peace was due to the development of independent royal power in these parts of Europe, particularity in Germany where the church was only one insti- tution among others. The priority of the state over the church was main- tained. Thus in the records of the tenth and eleventh centuries we hear little of persecutions of Jewish communities in the central parts of Europe, when, like a catastrophe of nature, the cru- sades changed the conditions com- pletely, and extended the principle of war for religion's sake over the Jewish minorities. EFFECTS OF THE CRUSADES The Middle Ages had known re- ligious wars prior to the crusades; it always had been a merit to wage war against the unbelievers. But the Jews, living as minorities among the peoples of Europe, had not been considered pagans; the "Concordia" linked them with Christianity, a religious tie with the Christians, however faint, was still acknowledged. Now, in 1096, religious -fanaticism produced the idea of exter- minating the "enemies of Christ" at home. For a multitude of zealous and misled pilgrims it meant to earn the credit of the crusade quicker than through actual warfare in the Orient. It was the simple and tempting con- cept of the mob to take into their hands the punishment of the Jews for the death of Christ by annihilating the Jewish communities or forcing bapt- tism on them. These excesses were seriously opposed by the responsible leaders of the crusades but they re- peated themselves, in France, Ger- many and England, during each crusade, with the regularity of a dreadful phenomenon of nature. Even the genius of Bernard of Clairvaux, who inspired Europe to the second crusade in 1147, was powerless against this spirit of revenge, superstition, and fanaticism. These excesses destroyed the potential value still slumbering in the "Concordia" and opened an age of increasing humiliation, oppression, persecution, and violence in every form. We quote from a contemporary chronicle: While the whole creation was calling up to the service of the creator, the evil one sowed weed among the good seed, aroused false prophets . . . among God's soldiers under the pretext of religion, whereby even the chosen people were led astray. . . . Count Emicho, a man of ill repute for his despotic arbitrariness, started out and claimed that divine revelation had called him to his new vocation, like another Saul, and he wrong- fully assumed the leadership of about twelve thousand crusaders. When these hosts passed through the cities along the Rhine, the Main, and Danube rivers, they tried to demon- strate their zeal for Christianity in that they exterminated completely the cursed people of the Jews, or tried to have them baptized by force, wherever they met them. ... [The Jews of Mayence had found refuge in the residence of the bishop] yet neither the bishop nor his men . . . were able to protect the Jews and to save them from the hands of the pilgrims; perhaps because Christians would not fight Christians for the sake of Jews. . . . Only very few sur- vived who resorted in their despair to bap- tism; and surely the Jews should be the least to be forced into Christianity against their will. Similar events took place everywhere. The kingdom of Jerusalem came into being only after the Jews who lived there had been burned in their syna- gogues. The secular power in France, Ger- many, and England did as much as</page><page sequence="10">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 475 possible to prevent these destructive short circuits. Henry IV, of Germany, restored at once the rights of the Ger- man Jews, in 1097; a few more power- ful cities defended their Jews against the pilgrims who passed by. Frederic Redbeard, of Germany, issued the strictest counter-measures before he left for the Holy Land in 1189, and so did Richard of England. The secular power had to act systematically to get control of these recurring events by placing the Jews under the direct and sole protection and jurisdiction of the king declaring that they belonged to the royal chamber. It was a move in consequence of the "protective letters" of the Carolingian age, and it took place during the 12th century almost in all European countries. It was the only move possible, and it was of dubious value. Though it secured pro- tection in return for high taxes, it rendered, in course of time, the Jews the living property of the rulers. Often the kings would realize these assets and pawn them to their princes, elec- tors, or cities, in return for support, granting them the privilege of exploit- ing this particular type of property. The material value of the Jews, and the right of the rulers to draw from it, became a common part of the prac- tice and theory from the thirteenth century on. It gradually confined the Jews to one place like serfs, deprived them often of their European connec- tions (without giving them a real home at the place of their residence) and reduced them, inwardly and out- wardly, to an isolated, sectarian, and despised existence. The measures of the church were even more thorough. The church com- promised with the misled fanaticism of the multitude (with which it shared indeed the historic responsibility) by sanctioning these dubious spirits indi- rectly and by accepting their goal, i.e., the violent oppression of religious min- orities, into its theology. The thir- teenth century is distinguished by its crusades against such minorities as the Jews and the Albigenses. The Lateran Council of 1215 (the same council that instituted the Holy Inquisition) pre- scribed to the Jews the wearing of badges and other discriminating signs and prepared thus the road to the ghetto. The Pope, Innocent III, pro- nounced the Jews as destined by God to serfdom forever-as a punishment for the death of Christ, and he as- sumed for Christianity the responsi- bility to execute this punishment. The numerous local authorities, who were in charge of Jews by virtue of royal privilege, excluded them gradually from guilds and trades, from real es- tate and from social intercourse with their environment. Soon they were generally limited to the only occupa- tion that the dogma of the church did not see fit for Christians (without being too consistent in that), namely, to lending money for interest. By these developments official Christianity withdrew from the "Con- cordia" as defined in the previous paragraphs. From now on was the Old Testament reduced to theological sig- nificance only; from here no light fell into the lives of the Jews. By doctrine and practice they had ceased to be the "descendants of the Patriarchs and Apostles" and were stamped as the "murderers of Christ." They became the easy victims of any outbreak of public enthusiasm, expectation, or fear. Instituting a new church festival usually meant distress and persecution for the Jews, as, for instance; the</page><page sequence="11">476 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION Jubilee of 1300. The accusations of ritual murder, desecration of the holy wafer, and sorcery became more fre- quent-followed by confiscations, public executions, burning of sacred books and religious implements. The most cruel reaction occurred from 1346-48 when the devastation and hor- ror of the great plague, the Black Death, was blamed and revenged on the Jews all over Europe. From then on the problem ceases to be a problem of the history of religion; it has its full share in the history of ignorance, su- perstition, and fear. Amidst this decline of a genuine re- ligious idea and during this humilia- tion of a minority, it is remarkable to see that the "Concordia" continues to give inspiration to the arts. "Concor- dia" is presented here by two women characters, "Synagogue" and "Ec- clesia," personifying the Old and the New Testament. Both figures made their way early from theological liter- ature into the minor arts and the medi- eval drama, reflecting much of the changing spirit of the problem. And while, in actual history, the tie of the "Concordia" that linked Christianity with Judaism was definitely cut, the art draws from the contemporary ca- tastrophe the finest inspiration. "Syn- agogue" plays a distinguished ryle in a unique drama, written in Latin around the year 1160 in Germany "ludus de Antichristo," in that the last events prior to the day of Judge- ment, the coming of the Antichrist and the end of his usurpation are pre- sented. After all the kingdoms of the earth have fallen to the Antichrist, mistaking him for the reappearing Christ, and forced into subjugation by gold, false miracles and fear, it is then the "Synagogue" who recognizes his true character, pronounces aloud and courageously his dreadful name and suffers martyrdom for Christ. This poetical fulfilment of the old prophecy, implied in the "concordia," may be inspired by Bernard of Clairvaux' great sermons against the persecution of Jews in 1146. And during the thir- teenth century, so fatal to the Jews all over the continent, it is the monu- mental sculpture that places Syna- gogue and Ecclesia side by side at the portals of the great cathedrals; to be sure, Ecclesia as the church trium- phant, and Synagogue humiliated and with veiled eyes. Yet great art does not live on hatred, discrimination and fear, and, consequently, some genial and truly independant masters gave Synagogue and Ecclesia a shape that is unforgettable to anyone who ever looked at them with some knowledge of their spiritual and historic signifi- cance. Thus they appear, in Strass- bourg and in Bamberg, though in their traditional posture, as of the same kin, physically and spiritually, one is in- clined to say, as sisters. They bear witness not only to the kinship of re- ligion and art, but also to the timeless significance of the "Concordia."2 EMANCIPATION The fight for the emancipation of the Jews during the 18th century is a coherent part of the general struggle for the "right of nature" or the "hu- man rights"; thus the forerunners of the latter, as the Magna Charta of England (1215), the Habeas Corpus Acts (1679) and the Bill of Rights 2 For a detailed historic monograph of the whole issue, as outlined so far in this article, see the author's publication "Synagogue and Ecclesia," to be published in 1942.</page><page sequence="12">ABSTRACT OF A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN EUROPE 477 (1689) have contributed to the eman- cipation by restoring elements of self- determination, dignity and freedom, though these were still limited to classes and nations. The first direct impulse, in favor of the Jews, came in England, when, in 1714, John To- land published his "Reasons for na- turalizing the Jews, in Great Britain and Ireland on the same foot with all other nations. Containing also a de- fence of the Jews against all vulgar prejudices in all countries." While de- cisive steps in the homeland were de- layed, the American colonies were open to settlers of any creed, and in 1740 Jews were here admitted to citi- zenship-a memorable date indeed when looking back over centuries of humiliation and homelessness. During the American war of Independence the various constitutions of the young states stressed the general ideas of freedom and equality and thus affec- ted decisively the coming French Re- volution. In 1781 the emperor Joseph II decreed his edicts of tolerance, and, from 1789 on, the cause of the Jews became definitely linked with the French revolution. Against popular prejudice, maxims of administration, privileges, church influence, and other obstacles, the emancipation made slow progress: parts of the French empire adopted emancipation even before the end of the 18th century. Prussia fol- lowed in 1812 in the course of her reconstruction. After the Vienna Con- gress, emancipation was held up for almost half a century. The remaining European countries completed the legal measures in the main between 1850 and 1870. In no single instance was emanci- pation of the Jews from their medieval bonds a mere act of legislation, but rather a slow historic process whose problems could not be met by the law only and continued to exist after the legislation had been enacted. The pro- gressing industrialization and the growing importance of large cities as- sisted the emancipation and stressed the necessity of making all citizens equal in duties and rights. On the other hand the centuries-old notions of es- sential differences between Jews and Christians took a firm grip on public opinion and prepared the basis of the anti-Semitism of the 19th century. In order to define these events in terms of the preceding paragraphs we need only to search after the religious elements in the "Age of Reason." Al- ready in the 17th century the English Puritanism, just on account of its es- teem of the Old Testament, had come to a new attitude towards the Jews. Cromwell's failing attempt to draw Jewish merchants from the Nether- lands to England (from where Jews had been banned officially since 1290) was partly motivated by that. Rem- brandt, the painter, who was a Men- nonite, again saw in the Jews, in whose midst he lived in Amsterdam, the di- rect descendants of the biblical char- acters-and one does not need to emphasize the importance of this fact for Rembrandt's art. One basic conviction of the 18th century is its confidence in the valid- ity of reason. On the basis of reason the science of the universe had been established by Galilei and Newton; philosophy had been orientated on rational ground by Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz; the science of history had developed various strictly critical branches assisted by classical philo-</page><page sequence="13">478 THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO EDUCATION logy: the declaration of Independence of human reason had been pronounced long before action was taken on the actual field. For the critical mind neither reason nor truth was found in many a historic institution within a nation, and the nations started out to rebuild their institutions on the basis of reason. No reason was found in theology as such; scientific critique had denied its doctrinary claims and its orthodoxy. The discriminating bar- riers that separated the creeds broke down, the enlightened spirits of the age dreamed of and discussed a reasonable religion, beyond theological argu- ments, acceptable to all mankind. En- lightenment would overcome ignor- ance, fear, magic, and superstition- the elements out of which those dis- criminating barriers had been erected. What had been true for the "Concor- dia," namely, equality before God and tolerance in life, came true once more through the adoption of reason on a wider scale than in the Middle Ages, embracing all fields of human en- deaver and theoretically, mankind. The Jewish problem was only one issue among others, and it was attacked with increasing effect. Only a few epochs of this evolution are to be men- tioned here. John Toland printed on the title page of his pamphlet in 1714 (see above) a passage from Malachi, a se- lection, that shows clearly the justifi- cation of human rights on biblical ground and might have been applied, just as well, to the "Concordia" dur- ing the Middle Ages: "Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously everyone with his neighbour?" (II, 10). The idea of religious tolerance was most ably presented in the writ- ings of Moses Mendelssohn, a Jew in whose intellectual achievements the complete union of the Jewish legacy with the modern culture of the 18th century is evident. Mendelssohn's in- fluence exceeded far the narrow limits drawn for his people and still valid in his days, and proved to the contempo- rary world that the Jews were worthy of and ready to citizenship in the world of enlightenment after centuries of seclusion, isolation and sectarian- ism. It was his friend Mendelssohn whom Lessing had in mind when he conceived the idea of his "Nathan the Wise," giving, in 1779, to the German public and to Europe the most pro- found, poetic concept of racial and re- ligious tolerance. Exactly at the same time practical suggestions concerning the integration of the Jews into state and society came forth: in 1781 (coin- ciding with the edicts of tolerance by Joseph II) Chr. W. Dohm published his memorable pamphlet "ilber die bUrgerliche Verbesserung der Juden" that found an echo in Mirabeau's policy. Dohm burdens the responsi- bility for the deplorable historic con- ditions of the Jews upon the vulgar prejudices of the public and the atti- tude of the state. He recommended civic equality, abolition of the many special taxations, admission to the trades, to art-craft, to agriculture and to the educational opportunities of the time. It took about a century to real- ize this program. For the historian the most important feature in Dohm's program seems to be that he restored the interdependence of majority and minority which had been the essential and practical value of the ancient "Concordia."</page></plain_text>
