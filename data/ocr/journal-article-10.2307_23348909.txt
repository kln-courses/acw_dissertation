<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kaani, the One-eyed Chick (A Note on the Story and the Translation) Bikram K. Das Basant Satpathy is said, by at least one critic, to belong to a tradition fathered by Fakirmohan Senapati. This means that he is perceived as, first and foremost, a gifted story-teller, writing within a naturalistic framework. His stories are fairly conventional in narrative technique - there are no startling innovations. Stylistically, he prefers the simple, colloquial idiom used by common folk. Basant Satpathy is also said to share the humanist tradition associated with Fakirmohan. He writes mainly (or often) about the marginalized and the down-trodden, with sympathy. However, he seems to have no ostensible reformist designs, unlike Premchand or Sarat Chandra. Social issues are viewed with tolerance and there is often an element of gentle, ironic humour in the stories. 1 discovered, in the story a text that was quite different from what others - who were far more widely read and better equipped critically - had found. To begin with, I found the story disturbing, although "disturbing" is not an adjective that many readers and critics would use to describe Basant Satpathy's work. The two unusual elements in the text to which I responded strongly were, first, a kind of brooding 'blackness' which seemed to me to hang over the story. It opens tamely enough, with a father taking tender care of his (apparently) motherless children. Almost immediately, however, an element of subdued violence is introduced. A kite carries away a chick, struggling and crying for help, to which the narrator's youngest child has been playing</page><page sequence="2">144 Indian Literature: 268 foster-mother. The quiet father suddenly thirsts for revenge against a mere bird, which is only doing what nature meant it to do; at the same time, the father realizes that such violence is, in his case, contrary to nature. The violence is infectious, however, and spreads to little Tunu. Violence escalates into an epic batde between metaphysical forces in the next part of the story. The narrator introduces a new protagonist, Shrinibas Mandal or Shini, a young lad belonging to an untouchable caste, living in a village dominated by Brahmins, who has been disowned by his father and turned out of the home. Shini has been serving the people of several villages by providing them with necessities, until a very minor government dignitary, a corrupt bus-conductor, deprives him of his livelihood ; but in return for his services the inhabitants of the village dub him a thief and a rascal. He is forced to take up poultry-keeping to earn his living, but his survival is threatened a second time - this time by a pair of kites. Unlike the narrator, Shini is not going to take the threat lying down. He climbs to the top of the tree on which the kites have nested, at great risk to himself, calls for a burning torch and demolishes the nest and the young ones living in it. The battle between Shini and the kites is described in gruesome detail. There is a striking contrast between this part of the story, which dominates the narrative, and the gentle, almost pastoral description of the village and the people who live in it. It is as though the action suddenly leaps to a new, almost elemental plane of existence. The kites become symbols of some sinister, unknown power and Shini is turned into a super hero. One wonders: why is the writer showing us these glimpses of a higher drama? What is going on? As a reader, I found it disturbing. I was unable to read it as a simple story about a boy and a bird - as the author may perhaps have intended. The other unusual element which I, but not everyone, discovered in the story was a strong element of surrealism - perhaps 'magic realism' is a more appropriate term. Reality and fantasy, the natural and the supernatural, mingle; human, animal and divine life come together. A five-day old chick cries out for help to its young caretaker. A she-kite offers sage advice in Sanskrit to her partner. The crowing of a cock reaches Lord Shiva in his temple and so disturbs the god that he feels obliged to destroy</page><page sequence="3">145 Bikram K. Das it. Shini becomes the prototype of the same angry god, dancing the tandav, the dance of destruction, on the tree-top. The kite reminds someone of the mythical Jatayu, the divine vulture. Even the title of the story, Kaani Chiyan (in Odia), has an anthropomorphic ring to it: the chick is given a name and becomes a person, a character. The structure of the story did not seem, to me, to follow the usual conventions of naturalistic narrative. (Another story by Basant Satpathy, which I read later, has the title 'Anti-romantic." Perhaps one could, with some justification, label this one 'Anti naturalistic.") The story opens in Puri, moves to Parlakhemuni, then to some other location which is not named, and finally, back to Parlakhemundi. The most important part of the action takes place in the unnamed place. A few places and natural objects in the neighbourhood, which are named, give us a clue as to where this place might be - but I had the feeling that the author was deliberately keeping the place, as well as the time of the action, ambiguous. And finally, 1 found the use of symbolism quite pervasive in the story. The strongest, recurring symbols are the kite and the simuli tree. Even though the story moves to several locations, the kite and the simuli tree seem to be everywhere - so that one begins to wonder if they are natural objects at all. â–¡</page></plain_text>
