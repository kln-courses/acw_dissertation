Agnes de Mille addressed the conference members at a luncheon. They viewed John Mueller's impressive film pro- grams and dance slides collected by Nancy Reynolds and Susan Reimer. Dance companies around the city welcomed them graciously to their classes, rehearsals and performances. And, most important, they held two business meetings to try to hammer their individual planks of experience into a comfortable and functional clubhouse for the organization. Despite the basic similarities of their situations, the only sub- ject on which they could easily agree was their-original defini- tion of purpose. The association, they declared, shall exist "to encourage excellence in dance writing through education, re- search, and the exchange of ideas." Having said that, they went on to disagree, politely but at great length, about nearly everything else. Who will be a member, they asked. How much will it cost? How often will we meet? Who will be in charge? An ex- ecutive board? How large? How often will they meet? Several silly questions were posed, and many more crucial ones were crushed beneath the necessary machinery of parliamentary pro- Dance and Theory of Expression Jack Glickman The 35th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Aesthetics (at the University of Washington, Seattle, October 26-29, 1977) featured a symposium on Dance and the Theory of Expression, with papers by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Curtis Carter (both with slides), comments by David M. Levin, and a lecture-demonstration by Jan Collum and members of the Ballet Tacoma. The phrase "the theory of expression" refers to aesthetic theories that attempt to explain in what sense art can be ex- pressive and how such expressiveness is effected. The prob- lem is to understand how, for example, a piece of music can be joyful or triumphant, how a painting can express gloom, or-to bring us to our present topic-how dance can express anguish, say, or joy. I cannot hope to do justice here to the subtlety and detail of the papers presented; I'll try only to indicate what were some of the main arguments in the papers by Cohen and Carter. Cohen elicited a framework for analyzing dance expres- sion from suggestions in a 1916 article by Fokine in the Rus- sian periodical Argus. There, she said, Fokine contends that dance is the "development" and "idealization" of naturalistic gesture, and that it is through gesture that the dancer conveys the feelings of the character he portrays: "The choreographer must develop the gesture to intensify its impact, isolating it for clarity, purifying it of accidental distractions to make it cedure which, regardless of available time, guaranteed every- one the opportunity to speak his piece, irrespective of its im- mediate relevancy, on every issue. I wondered why the discussion revolved around the size of the clubhouse when a fortress seemed more in order. Why should questions arise about limiting membership when safety always lies in numbers and not hanging together often leads to hanging separately? If the function of the organization is to legitimize and protect the members' efforts, aren't deadlines, wages and editorial policies the most pertinent issues? Perhaps it is only fair to measure the success of this meet- ing in terms of the concern the members demonstrated for its successors. They did elect a board: Iris Fanger, Boston; Alan Kriegsman, Washington; Alan Robertson, Minneapolis; Kitty Cunningham, Deborah Jowitt, Jean Nuchtern, Marcia Siegel, Tobi Tobias and David Vaughan, New York. I doubt any or- ganization can stand for long on theoretical foundations with- out its members' buttressing support. If, by means of parlia- mentary procedure and free expression, firm foundations have now been laid, the dance writers who meet a year from now will have something concrete on which to erect the shel- ter they need and the forum they want. project beyond the footlights. At the same time, he idealizes the gesture, stylizes it in a manner that does not contribute directly to its emotional quality. The choreographer, Fokine urges, should select the movement style that is most appro- priate to the era and nationality depicted in his work; then he should employ that style consistently so that costume, setting, and movement together create an harmonious whole." In explicating Fokine, and drawing out the implications of his view, Cohen showed how these notions of development and idealization might help to explain instances in which dance fails to achieve an appropriate expressiveness; they may be construed as instances in which the particular devices of de- velopment and idealization are misused so as to detract from, rather than enhance, the total effect of a dance segment. Also she suggested how these notions may help to define the basis of expression: "Perhaps," she conjectured, "the expressiveness of movement may lie in the interplay of two sets of tensions: between the original gesture and its development; between the developed gesture and its idealized form." In the course of her argument, Cohen discussed some differences between dance and mime, and between dance and acrobatics; and she sharply challenged Susanne Langer's claim that in dance what is expressive is not physical movement but rather the "apparent forces" created by movement. Carter examined the theory of Rudolph Arnheim ex- pounded in Art and Visual Perception (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969) and "Concern- ing the Dance" reprinted in Toward a Psychology of Art (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1966). Arnheim, who bases his theory of expression on the Jack Glickman, who teaches philosophy at SUNY Brockport, chaired the Program Committee of the 35th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Aesthetics. 62</page><page sequence="2">principles of Gestalt psychology, rejects the common view that the "sadness" of a weeping willow, for example, is merely an anthropomorphic projection. Rather he argues that the expression of sadness is in the very structure of the tree's appearance, and human expression is merely one in- stance of a kind of behavior occurring throughout nature. As Carter put it, on Arnheim's theory "expression can be embedded in the structure of such widely various objects and situations as the emotion of sadness, the appearance of a willow tree, a steep rock, the colors of the sunset, Picasso's Guernica painting, or the shape and movements of Martha Graham as she dances in 'Lamentation' .... Expression, for Arnheim, consists of actual structural properties which he calls dynamic qualities. These qualities result from the forces that establish the respective structures of emotions, objects, movements and other events." Carter explored in detail the implications of Arnheim's theory, illustrating how the theory answers various questions: for example, it "offers theoretical insight into the question of why some combinations of movement, costume, music and lighting work together, and why others do not. Successful integration of these elements can be achieved by selecting elements exhibiting the same expressive structures." Also, Carter argued, Arnheim's theory has the flexibility necessary to explain the source of expressiveness in dances that depend on narrative and theatrical conventions or on subject matter as well as the expressiveness of those that have no story and minimize theatrical conventions in favor of an emphasis on pure movement: "there is no problem with expressive pat- terns working in conjunction with subject matter, of with artistic conventions such as the gestural signs of the panto- mime." Carter pointed out, however, that the theory's great- est advantage, its generality, also poses the greatest problem for the theory-namely, identifying the structural pattern common to all instances in which a given feeling is expressed. David Levin commented very briefly on the papers by Cohen and Carter; unfortunately his remarks were cut short by limitations of time. The skillful lecture-demonstration by Jan Collum and members of Ballet Tacoma included a pre- sentation and analysis of "Gingko" a dance made for the company by Robert Rodham. The lecture-demonstration focused on the practical problems faced by the choreographer and the artistic director in trying to achieve specific kinds of expressiveness. Surveying the situation in aesthetics today, Carter noted that although there is substantial interest in the theory of ex- pression itself, and the many books and articles on the sub- ject "are mind boggling in their variations and subtle distinc- tions, for the most part . . . aestheticians writing on the expressionist theory have left aside the subject of dance.... There are surprisingly few references to or illustrations from the dance in the main stream discussions of the theory of ex- pression." The question of expression is exceedingly difficult and complex.1 And certainly a prerequisite to theoretical pro- gress is clearly defining the problems that require attention; it is salutary that there emerged from this symposium a clear sense of what some of the main problems are. This was due largely, I think, to the speakers' care not to neglect or blur important distinctions which may seem obvious when pointed out but which are too often overlooked. The speakers demonstrated the need to distinguish, at least preliminarily, the related processes of expression and representation, the expressiveness of the choreography and that of the dancer, the conventionalized expression of a particular identifiable emo- tion and the (inevitable?) expressiveness in the dynamic flow of the movement itself-to cite only a few examples. One hopes that the speakers will develop further the work undertaken for this symposium, and also that some of the aestheticians who were present have been encouraged to turn their attention to the problems of dance expression.
