HUSTON SMITH Professor of Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology TRANSCENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL CHINA' China's regard for nature, as expressed (for example) in Sung landscape painting, is clear and well recognised. What the Chinese believed to exceed the natural world, the realm of 'the ten-thousand things', is less clear. The present essay tries to explore this question systematically. We must first distinguish between the views of the peasants and those of the intelligentsia. Peasants believed the unseen world to be peopled by innumerable spirits, both benign (shen) and malevolent (kuei), who could dwell in idols and natural objects and be used or warded off by magic and sacrifice. After Buddhism reached China the geography of the spirit world was mapped in 33 Buddhist heavens, 8i Taoist heavens, and i8 Buddhist hells. Divination, astrology, almanacs, dream interpretations, geomancy, and witchcraft all figured as ways of establishing relations with invisible powers. We shall not linger over this popular view of the supernatural. In essence it is the Chinese version of folk religion which, where not dispelled by enlightenment modes of thought, has been universal throughout human history. What interests us here is the way the transcendent appeared to the Chinese intelligentsia-scholars, administrators, and landed gentry. A common answer, from Voltaire to James Legge and Hu Shih, is that transcendence scarcely figured in the outlook of the literati at all. A rep resentative statement asserts that 'Confucius confined his attention to reality, and his views are incompatible with religious matters'.2 Chinese intellectuals, by this view, were humanists, rationalists, and moralists. When they referred to heaven or took part in sacrifices it was from force of mechan ical habit, or to provide sops for the sentiments of the masses. Four things work to encourage this interpretation of the Chinese outlook. (i) The social accent of her outlook produced an unusual number of philosophers and schools that were purely utilitarian: The Realists, of course; but beyond them and within the Confucian stream itself such philo sophers as Yen Yuan and Tai Chen in the Ch'ing Dynasty (I644-19 I2) and such schools as the Yung-k'ang and Yung-chia in the Sung Dynasty (690 1 I am indebted to my colleague, Professor Nathan Sivin, for a number of helpful suggestions bearing on this study. 2 Liang Ch'i-ch'ao as quoted by C. K. Yang in John K. Fairbank (ed.), Chinese Thought and Institutions (Chicago. University of Chicago Press, I957), p. 270.</page><page sequence="2">I86 HUSTON SMITH I279).l (2) Chinese positions that are not exclusively utilitarian tend to appear more utilitarian than they are, because the general social bent of the Chinese mind inclines it to be more explicit about social matters even when it does not really wish to limit itself to them. (3) The utilitarian interpretation of Chinese thought fits nicely with the prejudice of modern academia which, inclining toward rational humanism, is pleased (as were Voltaire and the Enlightenment Sinophiles) to find this prejudice anticipated by the sophisti cated Chinese. Concomitantly the interpretation suits the propensity of modern Chinese intellectuals who are eager to justify Chinese civilization in the face of the stronger and rationalistically oriented Western world which considers mysticism and faith in supernatural powers to be symbols of way wardness and inferiority. (4) Finally, Chinese thought patterns are apt to appear utilitarian when considered 'functionally' by social scientists. Social scientists study society. As a consequence their professional biases cause them to pay particular attention to, and therefore to see most distinctly, the social aspects of what they look at. When, therefore, they look at the metaphysical and religious dimensions of cultures, it is the social roots and consequences of these dimensions that leap to view. Durkheim's concept of religion, which for fifty years has dominated sociological and anthropological studies of the subject, is the classic formulation of this bias. 'The idea of society', he writes, 'is the soul of religion'.2 The gods of religion are collective representations. This means most obviously that they are ideas imposed on individual minds by the group, and more significantly that 'they not only come from the collective, but the things that they express are of a social nature. The reality, which mythologies have represented under so many different forms, but which is the universal and eternal objective cause of these sensations sui generis out of which religious experience is made, is society'.3 Durkheim's mistake consists in passing from the truth that religion has social consequences and reflects social patterns in its imagery to the erroneous conclusion that it must therefore have arisen and developed for social pur poses. This is like reasoning that because marriages usually produce children, children must be its object. In fact, couples often marry ahead of their schedule for children, with intent to have no children at all, or (as in old age) knowing they could not reproduce if they would. It is eminently the case that in China 'the religious factor plays an important role in justifying political powers, in establishing administrative authority, in maintaining peace and order, in upholding civic values, and in inspiring faith in the government and raising public morale during public crises'.4 But it is also 1 See T'ang Chun-i, 'The Development of Ideas of Spiritual Value in Chinese Philosophy' in Charles Moore (ed.), Philosophy and Culture: East and West (Honolulu.

Reviewing the role the Mandate of Heaven has played in Chinese history, a Chinese sociologist sees it as a device whereby 'the awe and respect for the supernatural ... put ... the coat of morality and honour on a dynas tic founder, who was basically a master manipulator of force and violence'.2 The retort of a Chinese humanist is that 'what the [sociologist] has failed to see is that the person leading the rebellion is a man of his own age and beliefs and not of ours. He would not, therefore, even dare to start a rebellion had he not been assured that the Mandate of Heaven was with him. In other words, the Mandate of Heaven was not a device to achieve political ends, but something seriously believed by both the ruler and the ruled. It was religious in a ... profound sense'.3 Actually the humanist overstates his case here. There doubtless were agnostics in every age who cynically played on prevailing faith to secure their worldly ambitions. But unless such cynics had been in the minority, there would have been no prevailing faith for them to play upon. That the numinous was real for Taoism and Buddhism, no one doubts; it is in regard to Confucianism that the question arises. We read in the Analects: The Master did not talk about extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings. (vii, 20.) While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits? ... While you do not know life, how can you know about death? (xi, I I.) To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof [at a distance] from them, may be called wisdom. (vi, 20.) But as H. G. Creel pointed out in a revealing study of this question a quarter of a century ago, of the pre-Sung commentators on these and similar passages in the Analects, not one saw in them signs of agnosticism, while among later commentators only four suggested that they contained such signs.4 The Romans may have assumed that man is the highest being there is; the Chinese, Confucians included, would have sided with the Greeks who considered such a notion atopos, 'absurd' (Aristotle). 'In spite of its pre occupation with this-worldly matters, Confucianism cannot be considered a completely rationalistic system of thought'.5 Confucius carefully kept the 1 George Ling, 'Functional Interpretation of Chinese Religion', Quarterly Notes on Christianity and Chinese Religion, XII, 2 (July 1963), p. 8. 2 C.

The formalised Confucianism about which we sometimes read, the Confucianism that is all exterior with no sensitivity to inwardness and the hidden mystery into which all of life's roots ultimately invisibly descend-this is fossilised Confucianism where it is Confucianism at all. The 1i which stood at the heart of Confucianism-alive was a tap-root fixed in the mystery of the Tao which, where not cut by selfishness, kept both individuals and society in living touch with Heaven's majestic will. We labour this point because it constitutes the chief barrier to accurate assessment of the traditional Chinese outlook. No more than the masses did the Chinese intelligentsia see the world as a disenchanted causal mechanism floating on a foundation of nothingness. The principal terms by which they referred to the transcendental 'more' that envelops and permeates the phenomenal world were 'T'ien (Heaven)' and 'Tao (Way)'. The former tends to be associated with Confucianism, the latter with Taoism. The differences between these complementary strains in the Chinese persuasion are more than terminological. The Taoists were in love with nature, the Confucians with history. This meant that the Taoists tended to stress the importance of keeping human nature, 'the uncarved block', undefiled, while the Confucians searched the past to discover which social patterns reflected T'ien most faithfully. 'The essential difference is the difference between Lao-tzu's direct way to the Tao and Confucius' detour by way of the human order ... Lao-tzu immerses himself in (the Tao), while Confucius lets himself be guided by his awe of [it] as he moves among the things of the world'.' But the differences are in approach and emphasis only. No more than Lao-tzu did Confucius take the community as an absolute. Both believed man and nature to be undergirded by an eternal numinous reality from which life proceeds and which inclines it toward harmony. We can summarise the metaphysics of the Chinese literati in five points: i. Both men and Heaven, both the phenomenal realm and the noumenal realm, are real. Underlying the visible is something of immense importance that is invisible. 2. The essential relation between the two is unity or non-duality. Life's dependability, mingling with nature's, betokens a hidden oneness in the bosom of the multiple, a total interdependence at the heart of the spheres. In this respect Chinese metaphysical thought simply instances the correlative character of Chinese thought generally. Many Chinese terms, such as 'i (principle)', 'ming (ordinance)', 'tao', 'teh (power)', and !yang-yin', apply to Heaven and man equally. Tien ming, for instance, the Heavenly Ordinance, 'exists neither externally in Heaven only, nor internally in man only; it exists, rather, in the mutuality of Heaven and man; i.e., in their mutual 1 Karl Jaspers, The Great Philosophers (New York. Harcourt, Brace and World, 1957), p. 70.</page><page sequence="5">TRANSCENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL CHINA I89 influence and response, their mutual giving and receiving'.' Other terms, like 'God (ti)', 'pneuma (ch'i)', 'grand polarity (t'ai-chi)', 'non-polarity (wu-chi)', 'the Origin (yuan)', and 'non-being (wu)', refer primarily to Heaven but are manifest and function in man also. Still others, such as 'mind', 'emo tion', 'desire', and 'ambition', denote human qualities while connoting that these qualities have their sources in Heaven. A rhythm falls upon the visible, breaking it into day and night, summer and winter, male and female, but these divisions are caught up and ordered in a superior integration, the Tao, which resolves the tensions and reconciles the apparently irreconcilable. As the Great Commentary puts it: 'Nowyin, nowyang: that is the Tao'. Heaven and earth agree. They are united in a hymn for a double choir, an antiphony on a cosmic scale. A paradigm of correlative thinking appears in those strikingly un-Semitic instances-e.g., the Chou rites for King Wen as well as for his ancestor Hou-chi-in which the Chinese joined man with Heaven and sacrificed to both in the same act.2 3. In keeping with another general theme in Chinese thought, that the mutual reciprocity that pervades all things is in most instances between unequals, the relations that link man and nature are not symmetrical. Heaven is clearly the senior partner. As Confucius says: 'Only Heaven is great .. . The superior man ... stands in awe of its ordinances' (Analects, xvi, 8). 4. Heaven's grandeur does not, however, force it into the foreground of human thought. The Chinese perspective remains humanistic in the double sense that (a) man is more often than Heaven the explicit object of attention, and (b) when the Chinese mind does think explicitly about Heaven it usually gets at it through man by considering Heaven's relation to and import for man.3 Again Confucius is paradigmatic. 'He who lives by jen has but one anxiety in his heart: not to know man' (Analects i, I6). In short, the Chinese were interested in man as he appears against a noumenal backdrop. He is smaller than the backdrop, but he stands out more clearly in our attention. Or if we prefer a musical analogy, the note the Chinese sounded was man, but it carried numinous overtones. The overtones were more majestic, but the note actually sounded was more distinct. 'The wise man vibrates the heart of man and the universe harmonises. The one who can understand these resonances is able to understand what moves the celestial, the terres trial, and all of creation in its multiplicity' (I Ching, Commentary on hexa gram 31). 5. The weighting of explicit attention toward man as noted in the pre 1 T'ang Chun-i, 'The T'ien Ming (Heavenly Ordinance) in Pre-Ch'in China', Philsophy East and West, xi, 4 (January I962), p. 195. 2 Tang Chun-i, op. cit. p. 201. 3 Cf. William S. Haas, The Destiny of the Mind: East and West (New York. Macmillan, 1956), p. 149: 'The Eastern [read East Asian] mind is not interested in ... an independent object.... From the very beginning the main problem was to secure an unassailable position for man in the face of all that exists within and around him.'</page><page sequence="6">I90 HUSTON SMITH ceding point causes the numinous to receive in Chinese thought less sharp, objective symbolisation than it does in either India or the West. In ancient Chinese thought the numinous was personified: the character for Heaven was originally a rough sketch of a man, and in the Odes, the Book of History, and the Tso Chuan, Heaven loves the people and metes out rewards to the virtuous. The coming of philosophy dissoved not only this kind of anthropo morphism but all attempts to describe the numinous explicitly. Confucius never made last things his direct theme. At the approach of the ultimate he grew diffident. Seldom did he speak directly about Heaven, death, or the Tao. When asked about such matters he gave answers which left the questions open. We have noted the rationalist's tendency to conclude from such evasions that Confucius was a politically-minded positivist: he did not believe in the numinous but had sense enough to realise that it would be unpolitic to say so outright. For our part, having found reasons to reject this agnostic interpretation, we look to other explanations for his reticence. The principal one we have already named: his refusal to let his direct gaze be distracted from man. But beyond this, Confucius' answers to questions about the numinous left the questions open because the subject imposed such answers. Like the Buddha whose teachings were to move in and take their place beside his own, Confucius was aware at some level of the extent to which men are led to ultimate questions by inauthentic motives: idle curiosity or the wish to circumvent responsibilities at hand and thus detour the road into life. Confucius had no wish to pander to such motives. More important, he sensed intuitively what philosophers today, be they phenomen ologists or analysts, are coming to see explicitly: the impossibility of discus sing objectively what can never be the object of such discussion. In our time Heidegger, Jaspers, Buber and Wittgenstein have all stressed the violation that is wrought when one tries to discourse objectively about what can never, properly speaking, become an object. Ultimately it is the same perception that prompts both the Tao Te Ching's opening warning that 'the Tao that can be expressed in words is not the eternal Tao' and Confucius' refusal to speak directly to metaphysical themes. No more than 'Lao-tzu' was Confucius indifferent to the unknowable. He became chary at its mention because he was unwilling to deform intimation into pseudo-knowledge and lose it in words. 'For him the Encompassing is a background, not a theme to work with; it is the limit and foundation to be considered with awe, not the im mediate task.' His certainty was rooted in the Encompassing, but it enjoined him to turn to mankind in the actual world. So we discern the presence of last things in his outlook only indirectly, 'in his pious observance of customs and in maxims which, without explicitly saying much, suggest a way in critical situations'. His direct concern was for beauty, harmony, integrity, and happiness in the world, but all these were grounded 'in something that is not made meaningless by failure and death'.</page><page sequence="7">TRANSCENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL CHINA I9I What Karl Jaspers says of Confucius in these last three quotations' can be said of the Chinese intellectual position generally. The spiritual 'upholds all, is imminent to all, and nothing can be separated from it' (Doctrine of the Mean, xiv). But it is a zone which 'one contemplates without seeing, listens to without hearing' (ibid.). Like the cosmos itself which both manifests the Tao and conceals it, sages can allude to the numinous but are quickly brought to silence. 'When man has examined the universe closely-the perfect alter nation of days and nights, of heat and cold, their constriction as they go, their unbending as they come [again]-he reaches a point beyond which he cannot go' (paraphrased from the I Ching, Great Appendix, chapter v, by Confucius or his school). To understand the depths of Tao or the decrees of Heaven is impossible for man. 'The Tao! How deep and unfathomable!' (Tao Teh Ching, Giles translation). 'Heaven is what it is' (Doctrine of the Mean, xxvii). So the literati alluded to Heaven more than they defined it, and they sensed it more than they alluded to it. At the same time they were shrewd enough to realise that they could not eschew symbolisation entirely or deference would turn to forgetfulness. So they sacrificed. When the Emperor offered the annual sacrifices to Heaven and magistrates gathered villagers around mounds to sacrifice to earth, peasants may have visualised gods being fed and buttered up generally to ensure their continuing benefactions. Most scholars would have had no such anthropomorphic imaginings, but they would not for this reason have deemed the sacrifices less important nor valued them solely for their effects on the masses. For gentry no less than peasants, 'sacrificial and ritualistic activities were carried out for a sense of awe, wonder, and gratitude toward an unfathomable power which [could] never be explained simply in socio-economic and psychological terms'.2 Sacrifices represented the community's collective recognition that it was not autono mous, that it was enveloped by a 'more' that nurtured it as long as its divine imperatives were honoured. They constituted the Chinese way of expressing the feeling 'this nation, under God'. To summarise: For the literati the noumenal was (i) real, (2) organically related to the phenomenal, (3) more majestic than the phenomenal while being (4) less in focus or rewarding for direct attention and (5) better intima ted than explicitly described, better sensed than thought. What the sense provided above all else was the awareness of being related. According to a contemporary psychiatrist, this awareness is man's fundamental want. 'A longing for knowing that one has roots, that one's existence reflects the order and trustworthiness and utter 'sanity' of the universe itself . . . a longing for some absolute awareness of relatedness [is] man's deepest need'.3 China's 1 The Great Philosophers (New York. Harcourt, Brace and World, I957), p. 70. 2 George Ling, op. cit. p. 8. 3 Robert Murphy ,Psychotherapy Based on Human Longing (Pendle Hill. Pamphlet i i I. September 1960), p. I2.</page><page sequence="8">I92 HUSTON SMITH concentric vision, the vision of society set like a stone in nature and nature set similarly in the deep repose of eternity, filled this need. If everything is tied together in an organic system of interdependent parts, man's life shades into eternity. The concept inspired a medley of profound religious institutions. One sensed the blessings of Heaven and Earth as they flowed into the society which sustained one's life. Or if taste tended toward monism, one sensed the soul of man as identical with the soul of Heaven and Earth and all things. Security was assured, for society was no holding operation, pieced together against chaos by some precarious social contract. It was man's natural condi tion, the condition to which cosmic sources naturally inclined man if he did not wilfully and selfishly divert them. But security was not the vision's only yield. Relatedness gave life meaning as well. An important reason for existen tial despondency in the contemporary West is the existentialists' conclusions that man's values are free-floating, that they have no grounding or sanction beyond his own private regard. The Chinese saw things otherwise. The values that rightly order society imbue everything. They are rooted in being itself. 'The Heavenly ming (Ordinance) . . . and . . . "what one's heart feels peace in" . . . are two aspects of one thing." When Confucius extolled the legendary founders of Chinese civilisation it was no idiosyncratic inventiveness that he praised. He revered them because, having perceived the eternal archetypes of heaven, they ordered their lives by them to the point where they became transparent through them. 'Only heaven is great; only Yao was equal to it'. These psychological benefits which the Chinese derived from the trans cendent were important, but equally important was the way it re-enforced the dutiful, social conduct they prized so dearly. First, it provided grounds for their conviction that the social norms (ii) which individuals should strive to exemplify in their conduct toward one another were not arbitrary. Had the Chinese suspected that these norms were no more than conventions or, worse, had been perpetrated by a segment of society to shore up its privileged position, they could have regarded them more lightly. As it was, they saw them as sanctioned by the cosmos: they were natural law. 'The "rules" . . . have their origin in Heaven and Earth, i.e., in "the central harmony between Heaven and Earth".'2 When society is ordered as it should be, when men behave human-heartedly toward one another, when rulers govern wisely and sacrifices are observed in spirit as well as form, then society, nature and cosmos combine to function like a beautifully synchronised machine. But deviate from the heaven-appointed pattern and everything will go wrong. Wars and pillage will abound. Even nature will be thrown off its track and erupt in plague and rampage. It is in this connection that we have our best chance of understanding Confucius' 'reversed time orientation', for it was in the human record that Confucius thought men have the best chance of perceiving what the Heavenly 1 T'ang Chun-i, op. cit. p. 213. 2 Ibid. p. 208.</page><page sequence="9">TRANSCENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL CHINA 193 sanctioned values are. If Confucius has been mistaken for a rationalist, he has been mistaken oftener for a conservative. The mistake is understandable for he did characterise himself as 'a transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients'.' But we must be careful, in reading this sentence, making sure in particular that we balance it with his seemingly opposite assertion that 'a man born in our days who returns to the ways of antiquity is a fool and brings misfortune upon himself'.2 As no uncomplicated conser vative could have said that, we do better to read Confucius' attitude as historical rather than conservative in any mechanical sense.3 He loved the past, but not for itself so much as for the fact that it is there that we see the woof of man's doings laid out on the warp of eternity. This makes it the place where normative values become most clearly evident, ideally through exemplification, but if not, then through their conspicuous absence. To embody these values in the present calls not for blindly reduplicating the past but for translating what was good within it into contemporary idiom. Repetition of the eternally valid, this rather than imitation of empirical history was his object. Only on this interpretation could Karl Jaspers say of him: 'Here for the first time in history a great philosopher shows how the new, merging with the tradition flowing from the source of eternal truth, becomes the substance of our existence'.4 If the Confucians loved history, the Taoists loved nature. Here we come upon a second way in which the Chinese sense of the transcendent supported appropriate social conduct; namely, by imbuing her people with the sense that human nature inclines toward appropriate conduct in a kind of natural tropism. Instead of scanning the past to see which attitudes and acts go well and which do not, the Taoists advocated centring down to 'the uncarved block', man's original unspoiled, Tao-endowed nature, believing that if we could unburden ourselves of society's warping effects we would all behave very well. Though the Taoists were unique in staking everything on this 'return to the source', the notion that man is naturally inclined toward virtue is widespread in Chinese thought. Very early the Odes tell us that 'Heaven gives birth to the people. If there is a thing there is a rule for it; therefore the nature of the people will naturally incline to virtue'. Confucius continued the refrain-'True goodness springs from man's own heart . .. Is virtue so far away?'-while Mencius went 'much further than Confucius in his insistence upon the goodness of human nature ... teaching ... that since human nature is endowed by heaven, it must be good'.5 'Man's natural 1 Analects vii, i. 2 Quoted in Karl Jaspers, op. cit. p. 54. 8 The attitude of Confucianism, as distinguished from that of Confucius, is another story well reviewed in A.

Yet . . . its role in Chinese history has been largely that of conserver'. 4 Op. cit. p. 54. 8 Lee Shiu Keung, 'The Doctrine of Man: Confucian and Christian', Quarterly Notes on Christianity and Chinese Religion, v, 2 (June I96I), p. i.</page><page sequence="10">I94 HUSTON SMITH tendency toward goodness is like the water's tendency to find the lower level', he wrote. The ancient sage kings were simply men who fully developed their innate goodness. With the passing of the centuries the debate over whether man is innately good was to deteriorate into pedantic bickering and trivial scholasticism. But in the formative stages of Chinese thought the question was vital. For our image of ourselves affects our conduct: we do not always behave like the kind of person we think we are, but we tend to do so. To believe that one's fundamental nature participates in the transcendent source of all goodness, call it Tao or T'ien, is to be disposed to some extent to act accordingly. Though man is naturally inclined toward virtue, this inclination is at birth, as Mencius says, only a tender shoot which must be nurtured and developed. This brings us to a third way in which the transcendent re enforced appropriate social conduct: it rewarded virtue's cultivation. In ancient times this reward meant worldly prosperity. Thus we read in the Book of Odes that Heaven cherished the illustrious virtue of King Wen, and so the Heavenly Ordinance (ming), which would ensure a successful reign, came upon him. With the coming of sophistication, Heaven's reward came to be conceived more inwardly, moving toward a Chinese version of virtue as its own reward. It continued to be assumed that the Heavenly Ordinance would descend on the man who cultivated his virtue, though it might be clearer at this stage to say that the virtuous man's life would become aligned with the ming; but the ming for the individual (the ming for the ruler was a different matter) no longer implied worldly success. 'It does not necessarily follow that upon the man who "receives the Heavenly ming" God will definitely bestow wealth and high rank, and make him the actual king ... [Being] unlimited . .. the . . . Tao may be realised equally in the outward success and the outward failure of men'.' This drift of thought led directly to Chuang Tzu's concept of the man of virtue as one who is in complete harmony with whatever transpires. Through unswerving loyalty and filial piety man becomes indifferent to both pleasure and grief. The man who preserves his inner harmony and spiritual glory will be so attuned to the operation of ming amidst variable circumstances that he will be in accord with whatever happens. From this premise Chuang Tzu proceeds to his ideas of 'enjoying one's heart in accordance with things as they are' and 'non-differentiation of things leading to a state of untroubled ease'. The man whose heart has come to rest in ming is indifferent to circumstances in pursuing his duty, even to death. 'Death and life are great considerations, but they could work no change in him. Though Heaven and Earth were to be overturned and fall, they would occasion him no loss.'2 'I and Heaven and Earth are born together, and I and all things in the universe are in a state of unity.'3 Amidst these changing concepts of the character of reward, ' T'ang Chun-i, op. cit. Part I, p. 201; Part II, p. 32. 2 Chuang Tzu ch. v. 3 Ibid ch. ii.</page><page sequence="11">TRANSCENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL CHINA I95 the constant element was the notion that things in their widest and most ultimate context, are set up in such a way that, whether visibly or invisibly, grossly or subtly, outwardly or inwardly, virtue brings satisfaction. Fourth, the transcendent supported social conduct by encouraging its development beyond any given stage that it actually reached. This comes out in the idea that 'the Heavenly ming is not unchangeable' (Book of Odes and Book of History). Were it unchangeable, a man who had developed a modicum of virtue could rest on his oars, content with the Heavenly blessing that came with the virtue he had acquired. In point of fact, however, ' "acceptance of the Heavenly ming", in its true meaning, is ... the starting point of something to be done, rather than a terminal point of something already accomplished.... Once one has received ming he must further cul tivate his virtue." The reason he must do so can be stated both positively 'The more fully men cultivate their virtue, the more fully will heaven confer its mandate on them'2--and negatively: those who fail to keep cultivating their virtue will find Heaven's blessing withdrawn. Such statements obviously point to a relationship in which 'there is mutual influence and response between Heaven and men'.3 In his discussion of 'correlative thinking' and 'resonance' in the second volume of Science and Civilization in China, Joseph Needham describes this relationship with great penetration.4 Here, with limited space, we try to reach its essential point through cybernetics: Cybernetics is not just a technological revolution; it is a revolution in our way of thinking.... Western man has traditionally thought . .. in terms of cause and effect going in one direction. That is, if A causes B, B cannot cause A. The reason for this assumption is that event order has been confused with logical order; Western man has assumed that because 'circular argument' is prohibited in logic, there cannot be circular causal relationships in natural or social events. But not everyone has thought this way ... Peoples in pre-communist China ... have seen the universe as a mutual process of. . . influences in harmony and occasionally disturbed harmony-in complementary balance rather than in vertical opposition ... In a sense they have been living cybernetically . . . Cybernetics [in one of its aspects] is concerned with the growth, development, and the rise of complex structures resulting from mutual interactions between components which do not fall into a causal hierarchy.5 The relation between the Heavenly ming and human effort constituted an important instance of such mutual interaction. The more man exerted himself in the cultivation of his virtue the more the Heavenly mandate 1 T'ang Chun-i, op. cit. pp. 201, 203. 2 Ibid. p. 202. 3 T'ang Chun-i p. 203. 4 Cambridge University Press, 1956; especially pp. 279-91. r Magoroh Maruyama, 'Cybernetics', NEA Journal (December I964), pp. 51-2.

The more his efforts slackened, the further the mandate receded and the more difficult it became for him to renew his moral exertion. Finally, in all of the four ways we have enumerated, the transcendent encouraged political as well as private morality. The Emperor's position was not simply that of the man who had risen to the top of violence's heap. He ruled with the Mandate of Heaven for the benefit of the world under Heaven. As this Mandate is unceasing-'Heaven constantly loves the people and therefore looks on all parts of the world to find a dwelling place for its mandate, which it confers unceasingly'1-if one Emperor's regime ceased to furnish the Mandate a fitting abode, Heaven would be forced to spot and back to victory a new Emperor whose regime would renew the hospitality. 1 T'ang Chun-i, op. cit. p. 203.</page></plain_text>
