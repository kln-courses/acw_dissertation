(Communicated by Gordon R. Willey.) TOPOGRAPHICAL SETTING The province of Pataz (see map, Fig. 1), located at the eastern edge of the Peruvian highlands, enjoys an isolation that is un common even in rural Peru. Not only is it too far east to be in the orbit of the ancient north-south route through Huamachuco, Ca jabamba, and Cajamarca, but its own ter rain has prevented its extensive use as a jumping-off place for one of the several trails from the highlands into the eastern jungle. Aside from pure distance from the centers of population in the highlands, like Huama chuco, Pataz is also cut off from the main body of the mountains by the canon of the Maranon River, which forms a barrier from south to north. Pataz is simply the western slope of the final eastern range of the Andes. From the Maranon, flowing at an altitude of 1,300 meters in the Pataz region, to the top of the eastern cordillera at more than 4,000 meters the distance as the crow flies is only 14 km at some points and nowhere more than 25 km. The Maranon and the crest of the eastern cordillera form the west ern and eastern boundaries of the province. This gives the whole province the effect of being turned up at an angle of about 1 This report summarizes the architectural find ings of an expedition to Pataz during a part of the months of July and August, 1949, sponsored by the Institute of Anthropology of the National Uni versity of Trujillo, Peru. The personnel included the author, Luis Gutiérrez, John Ladd, Mrs. Helen P. Ladd, and Mrs. Phyllis Curtin, all of whom contributed to the preparation of this re port. The author is indebted to Richard Schaedel, the director of the Institute of Anthropology, and to Drs. José Eulogio Garrido and Manuel Zava leta C., of Trujillo, for their assistance in the field. He also wishes to express appreciation for consul tations with Drs. A. Kidder, II, and Wendell C. Bennett. Sr. Gutiérrez is preparing a report on the ceramic and skeletal materials from Pataz, which will appear elsewhere. •20°, but this slope is not uniform. The valley of the Maranon was once a pleasant saucer shaped valley with the river flowing on hard rock strata at about 2,500 meters. Once these strata were worn through, the river cut through the softer material leaving a canon with extremely steep sides falling off more than 1,000 meters from the original valley floor. The difficulties in crossing the Maranon, even by mule, have retarded the economic development of Pataz, but in recent years two mining centers have grown up at Réta mas and La Paccha. Until now the mines have been supplied by mule trains from across the Maranon and by air to a small landing strip at the southeast end of the Laguna de Pias. A highway from Huama chuco to Chagual on the Maranon and from there to Tayadamba, passing through the mining centers has been under construction for some years and may be finished by 1951. In addition to the inaccessibility of the region from the central highlands, the eastern tributaries of the Maranon have cut the province transversely, at some points to the depth of the Maranon itself. In central Pataz there are two such barriers. One of these is the valley formed by the Parcoy River, the Laguna de Pias, and the Alpamarca River. The second is the river valley formed by the Rio de la Playa rising near Buldibuyo and the Rio de Cajas rising near Tayabamba. These join at Huaylillas to form the Rio de Nahuinbamba flowing into the Maranon at Puente Jocos. These two deep valleys ef fectively separate the central massif and the high puna lying between Chilia, Parcoy, and Buldibuyo from the regions centering around Tayabamba to the south and the town of Pataz to the north. 49</page><page sequence="2">50 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 41, NO. 2 The expedition in 1949 confined itself to a the Nahuinbamba on the south and the survey of the archeological remains in the Parcoy on the north. This forms a small central area, that is, to the area between natural geographical region centering around Fig. 1.—Map showing archeological sites in central Pataz, Peru.</page><page sequence="3">February 1951 curtin : new archeological sites in pataz, feru 51 the town of Chilia and its rich valley. Al though this region is not large, there are enormous climatic variations. In the high puna within the triangle Chilia-Parcoy-Bul dibuyo the cold high grasslands are used principally for sheep raising. Lower down transportation animals are grazed. Still lower in the valleys of Chilia, of the Parcoy, the de la Playa, the Parcoycito, and the Queros the normal Andean crops of maize, wheat, potatoes, and alfalfa are grown. In the canon of the Maranon there are no crops below the altitude of 2,500 meters because of ex treme aridity. Only desert vegetation is found from that altitude to the bottom of the canon. Along the banks of the river it self small areas are irrigated and planted in coffee, oranges, mangoes, and bananas. Sur plus agricultural products are mainly sold to the two mining centers at Rétamas and La Paccha, but a small amount is also ex ported across the Maranon. CHILIA The present village of Chilia, at 3,170 meters in the center of the arable area, was not an ancient habitation site. It was formed, according to local legend, under the Viceroy Toledo in the late sixteenth century from the two older villages of Chilia and Charcoy located on opposite sides of the valley. The tradition of the two separate villages is still strong and has a part in many local rivalries. Nevertheless, the patasinos generally have forgotten Quechua and any precedent lan guages and speak only Spanish. Casual ob servation seems to indicate that the popu lation is almost entirely mestizo. In spite of its relatively recent origin, Chilia has come to have more stone sculp ture than any site found in Pataz. The Fig. 2.-—Stone relief slab with feline motif, Chilia Village. Fig. 3.—Warrior figure 86 cm high from stone relief slab, Chilia village. ancient citadel of Nunamarca is close to the village and has supplied almost all of the building stone used in its construction. The inhabitants have also gathered a number of stone slabs carved in relief. These are kept as decorative pieces for door sills or for decora tion within the houses. Twenty-four pieces were examined, though there are surely many more in the vicinity.2 These fell into moder ately well-defined motif catagories. Of the 24 examples, eight had designs depicting felines. These are carved in relief 5 to 10 mm high on one side of stone slabs about 20 cm wide by 50 cm long and 10 cm thick (Fig. 2). These figures showed no particular orientation of the head to the right or the left of the slab, but all faces were shown full face and had a strong tendency toward an thropomorphic features. All tails were curved upward. The number of toes shown on the feet varied from one to four, with several examples having two very birdlike toes. In addition to the eight slabs showing a single 2 The National Museum at Pueblo Libre has a collection of stone sculpture from Chilia and Nunamarca made by Dr. Julio Tello in the late thirties. Unfortunately, Dr. Tello did not pub lish a report on this expedition before his death, and the National Museum does not indicate the exact provenance of these exhibits. In addition to the sculpture types found in 1949, this exhibit includes head-tenons from the Chilia area.</page><page sequence="4">52 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 41, NO. 2 Fig. 4.—Figure 35 cm high from stone relief slab, Chilia Village. feline, two slabs showed two feline figures. One of these had two typical felines with their heads together at the center of the slab. The other was similar, except that the two felines shared a single head, having one body on either side. Next to the feline, the most common figure on relief slabs was a warrior figure, occurring on five slabs of the 24. Typically this is a full-length figure of a man holding a club in one hand and a trophy head in the other. The only clothing commonly shown is a 3-element crown on the head, ear plugs, and an ornament resembling wings projecting on either side of the body from the hips. Genitals are often shown (Fig. 3). Third in frequency of occurrence is a full face anthropomorphic figure with both arms and legs in the air, occurring in four of the 24 examples. The arms are shown straight out from the shoulders and then upward at a right angle from the elbow (Fig. 4). The legs are bent outward from the hips and upward from the knees The only cloth ing shown on this type of figure is a three element crown worn by two of the four examples. The remaining stone sculpture is not clearly classifiable by groups. Three of the five remaining designs were geometric in character (Fig. 5) and showed no recog nizable naturalistic motif. Of the remaining two, one showed a monkey in sitting posi tion (Fig. 6). The other was a human head in the round, very roughly carved in the natural rock about 26 cm high and 13 cm in diameter. NUNAMARCA Closely associated with Chilia village there are two archaeological sites. The more im portant of these is Nunamarca, the largest site discovered in Chilia Valley. It is located at the top of a rocky promontory jutting into the center of Chilia Valley at an alti tude of about 3,500 meters, or 300 meters higher than Chilia itself (Fig. 7, b). These ruins can be reached from Chilia by following the mule trail toward Buldibuyo for about 4 km and then turning off sharply to the right at the farm of Augusto Dominguez. This house roughly marks the northern limits of the site. To the south and west the site is bounded by the steep sides of the bluff. At present Nunamarca is in a very bad state of preservation. It has been cultivated for some generations as well as being used as a quarry for building stones over the last several hundred years. Few of the former walls can be traced, but large numbers of cut stones are now piled up or built into walls to clear them from the fields. The remains of walls and building stones, how ever, still cover an area about 500 meters in length by 200 meters in width, an area considerably larger than the present village of Chilia. At the southern border of the site area, overlooking the bluff and cliffs, there is an extensive retaining wall about 150 meters in length and 10 meters to 12 meters in height, the total height being broken by a terrace about 1 meter wide some 5 meters from the top of the wall. This wall is con Vk\7/i i77 Fig. 5.—Latticelike design in low relief on slab 67 by 47 cm, Chilia Village.

An adobe mortar was used and the rows are somewhat irregular. Toward the eastern end of this wall about 2.5 meters from the top there is the entrance to a gallery about 1 meter square faced with stone and covered with a single stone lintel at the opening. According to local informants this was for merly open for some distance under the site, but a second shaftlike entrance at the top of the ruin was filled a few years ago. The dirt from this fill now blocks the gallery a meter or so beyond the entrance. Although the sculptured stones in Cliilia village originally came from Nunamarca, only one piece of sculptured stone was found ,, , „ ,0 ,. , . . „ „ ™. , , , , „„ pig. 6.—Monkev figure 18 cm high Irom relief at the site itself, f his was a slab about 00 cm gja|5j chilia village. in diameter, having a design of six concentric semicircles cut into it to the depth of about ward Hacienda "Deliciana."

These are placed in a row on the hill side, one below the other. A fifth chulpa lies some distance up the hill to the south of the well-preserved example, and a closer exami nation of the ruins will probably reveal more. Although the well-preserved chulpa is on the unterraced hillside, 8 meters up hill there is an artificially leveled area about 10 by 3 meters protected by a stone retaining wall on the upper side. On this level there are the remains of a rectangular structure. The only remaining wall in good condition is in the shape of an "L" about 2.7 meters high at the corner and 2 meters long toward either arm. This wall has a projecting corbel about 40 cm from the top. At the eastern end of the Matibamba ruins there is another wall in excellent pres ervation. This appears to be the remains of a rectangular building about 6 meters high standing on an artificial terrace. This "iglesiaor temple, as it is called locally, appears to have once had two stories and in many respects to be similar to the large central structures at Charcoy and Pueblo Viejo. SITES SOUTH OF CHILIA VALLEY Matibamba is the last of the seven sites examined along the north rim of Chilia Valley. According to local reports and exami nation from the distance there are fewer sites along the corresponding ridge to the south. The most prominent of these is Ush cun (see map, Fig. 1), lying on the southern ridge overlooking the Ruyabamba opposite Corrales de Piedras on the north. Some stone sculpture and burials are reported there. Still farther to the south, the extensive ruins of Colpan are found at the height of a pass between the valleys of the Aullobamba and the Nahuinbamba. These ruins consist of buildings and terraces similar to those examined in detail. Another similar group of ruins is Huancuy, found about 15 km south of La Paccha on a high point ringed with concentric terraces. This ruin is located just above Cachipicza on the valley floor and seems designed to protect the pass where the present trail crosses the shoulder of the mountain into the valley of the Nahuin bamba. This site was visited by Raimondi in I860.3 PIRURO To the north of the valley of Chilia, the site of Piruro presents a classic example of the hilltop structures found in Pataz (Fig. 7, c). It lies about 500 meters to the north west of the mule trail from La Vina to Alpamarca at the height of a small pass about 3,200 meters in elevation immediately before the final descent into the Parcoy valley. The situation is very striking for its location, giving a clear view up the valleys of the Ariabamba and Yurayaca as well as a large part of the valley of the Parcoy. Ap proaching by way of La Vina, Piruro is visible from the trail for several hours before actually arriving at the site. The structure itself consists of a large oval platform about 90 meters long by 50 meters wide. The sides of the platform now slope down to the hilltop about 8 meters below, but they may once have been faced with stone. On top of the platform there is a truncated pyramid about 8 meters high, being roughly 12 meters in diameter at the top. There are some sections of former re taining walls, but in most places these have been removed for modern buildings or walls. On the west side of the pyramid, where the walls are best preserved, there are indications that the sides once rose in four steps about 3 meters wide. All the remaining walls are of normal pirca construction with no pattern of large and small stones. Although a large number of well-cut rectangular stones were found near the site, none of these were in place. On the eastern side a treasure-seekers' excavation has completely removed a large part of each level.

Five general types of masonry were ob served in the Pataz region: (а) Unfaced rough pirca. (б) Faced pirca built with average uniform stones. (c) Faced pirca built ' with large and small stones in alternate courses. (d) Faced pirca of large stones placed at ran dom throughout a wall of smaller stones. (e) Faced pirca having a three-course repeti tive pattern. These masonry types are used either in walls completely of stone or as facing for clay and rubble walls or in retaining walls. Two additional features of the local stone work are the use of decorative corbels near the top of walls and of the corbeled roof. Although a reconnaissance survey of this sort can not be comprehensive, even for an area as small as central Pataz, it allows limited conclusions about the type of archi tecture and the extent of archaeological re mains to be found in the trans-Maranon region of Peru. But these conclusions must be very tentative, since the areas immedi ately surrounding Pataz on all sides have not been explored by archaeologists, even at the survey level. Particularly the southern part of Pataz, the provinces of Maranon and Pomabamba, and the general area between central Pataz and Chavin de Huantar merit a careful examination. Large ruins are re ported at Tarrija and Uchos in southern Pataz and at Llayno near the town of Poma bamba. Even surveys in these areas would help to clear up many problems connected with the appearance in Pataz of traits associ ated with the cultures of the Callejon de Huaylas. Among these traits, only to mention the most obvious, are stone-lined galleries, houses that were probably two-storied, and emphasis on the feline motif in stone sculp ture.4 The preponderance of round house out lines about 1 meter high and 3 meters in diameter as the ancient dwelling-house type in Pataz calls for special mention. The author observed nothing of this sort in current use 4 Bennett, Wendell C. The North Highlands of Peru. New York, 1944. in Pataz, but this type, though uncommon, is still used in parts of the Callejon de Huaylas. In these present-day buildings, the base is a rough stone wall approximately the same height and diameter as those in Pataz, while the roof is a conical thatching sup ported by a vertical pole in the center, 4 to 5 meters high. On the other hand, the Matibamba chul pas present a problem that must be left till further exploratory work is done. This type of square boxlike structure on a round base is striking, yet no examples have been re ported in the surrounding regions, that is to say, at Chavin, in the Callejon, at Marca. Huamachuco, or in the region of Cajamarca. On a more general plane, the whole area of Pataz seems to have been formerly more heavily populated than it is today, even if it is assumed that all sites in the valley of Chilia were not occupied at the same time. Of the sites visited only Matibamba and Lagarpampa are not equipped with defense works or located in easily defensible posi tions. Several of the sites, notably Charcoy and Pueblo 'Viejo and Huayan, are located at almost 4,000 meters elevation, far above the arable area and far above any visible source of water. This raises the question of the prehistoric political situation. Against whom were these defenses built? A tentative answer is suggested by Garcilaso's state ment that the pre-Incaic boundary between Huacrachuco and Chachapoyas was found just to the south of Pias.5 If this is true, the long valley of the Parcoy and Alpamarca Rivers forms a natural frontier. The heights to the south and west of the Parcoy, then, would be the natural defense line of Huacrachuco. It is possible that the chain of fortifications to the north of Chilia valley housed only garrisons. This would explain both the relative density of population on this ridge and the inaccessibility of the sites. Following this hypothesis only the sites on or near the valley floor like the Canta sites and Nunamarca would be economically sup ported by the production of Chilia valley. The garrison sites could have been sup ported by a much larger area. 6 de la Vega, Gakcilaso (El Inca). Comen tarios reales: pt. 1, bk. 8, chap. 1. Buenos Aires, 1945.</page></plain_text>
