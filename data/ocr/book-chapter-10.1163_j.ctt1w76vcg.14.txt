At this time he had retired and converted to Roman Catholicism.

Older houses were comparatively small and lacked the exaggerated   projection and curve of the roof which is now fashionable. The tongkonan, or family house of origin, is simultaneously a material struc- ture – the house itself – and the group of people who claim membership in it.  Having seen how the house serves as a vehicle for history, I turn now to the  way people relate to houses, and the way houses relate to each other, in the  present. The house, I argue, is the focal point of a kinship system which oth- erwise appears to lack any distinct boundaries. Just as the founding of houses  and their remembered sites in the landscape provide a sort of template for  constructions of the past, so the relations between houses in the present serve  as the framework within which people remember their genealogical links to  each other. Even to ask the correct questions about relationships, I discov- ered, required me to recast them in terms of relations between houses. This  dawning awareness was crucial to the slow process of learning to see past the  categories I brought with me to the field from my own training as an anthro- pologist. Only then could I get a clearer picture of how Toraja themselves  conceived of their kinship system.  Toraja trace ties not only to the house where they were born, but also to the  birthplaces of their parents, grandparents, or more distant ancestors. Descent  is traced bilaterally, and houses on both the mother’s and the father’s side of  the family are of equal importance. Throughout their lives, people maintain  Boek Waterson.indb   174 27-1-2009   8:23:02 </page> <page sequence="3"> IX  Trunk and branch 175 ties with a number of different houses. It is not necessary to live in the house  in order to trace a connection. Toraja live in basically nuclear family house- holds (sometimes including additional relatives such as a grandparent or  grandchildren), and the origin house is no exception. Out of all its descend- ants, only one nuclear family is actually resident in it. Whose family this  should be may be chosen by a meeting of all the descendants, who tradition- ally selected from among themselves the person they considered wealthiest,  cleverest, bravest, the best public speaker, or otherwise best fitted to be the  family spokesperson. In the case of politically dominant aristocratic houses  in the past, that person would also exercise political power over the commu- nity. The person chosen might be a man or a woman, though particularly if a  woman were chosen, her spouse must also be regarded as competent and reli- able. Nooy-Palm’s data from Kesu’ and the Tallu Lembangna show a strong  preponderance of male tongkonan heads, but the information I gathered in  the westerly districts showed a more even distribution of male and female  heads. Although men undeniably dominate in political life, a woman is not  precluded from holding political roles. Where she does so, in all the cases I  have observed, this is by virtue of high rank, which overrides considerations  of gender. Nowadays, many descendants of formerly powerful tongkonan  have taken advantage of educational opportunities to make successful careers  in business, government or the civil service in Jakarta or elsewhere. They still  retain their ties to origin houses and may wield considerable influence within  the family, so it is no longer necessarily the case that the tongkonan resident  today is its wealthiest or most powerful descendant. Since residence is not a limiting factor for membership in a house, any one  person may potentially claim to belong to dozens of different houses, and  the membership of one house intersects with that of another. Membership of  many houses is possible because links are only activated at certain times; this  occurs principally in the context of rituals, or of the rebuilding of a house, to  which all members ought to contribute. A woman’s links to her houses are not  curtailed at marriage; on the contrary, husband and wife together undertake  a dual responsibility to contribute to the houses and ceremonies of both of  them. It is in fact considered wrong not to maintain an approximate balance  in their efforts in both directions. The expense involved in asserting one’s  connections provides the practical limit to these activities. Most people, if  asked, will begin by expansively declaring their tongkonan to be innumerable,  but when pressed, will name the houses of their parents and grandparents,  and those of their spouse’s parents and grandparents, as the ones with which  they maintain real ties. Sometimes not even all of these will be named. But we  have seen that the tracing of genealogical ties is a matter of greatest concern  to people of high rank. Very high ranking individuals may really be able to  trace ties with a great number of tongkonan, though their links to some of  Boek Waterson.indb   175 27-1-2009   8:23:02 </page> <page sequence="4"> 176 Paths and rivers these are likely to be demonstrated only at very long intervals, if at all. To  trace the boundaries of any individual’s allegiances to houses is therefore no  simple matter, though we can learn a lot by looking at how people organize  the rebuilding of a house. This happens rather often, since repeated renewal  is part of the process by which a house comes to be regarded as an ‘origin  house’ in the first place. Because of this, houses may be renewed before it is  physically necessary. Secondly, since membership in a house entails jealously  guarded rights to land, and to burial in house tombs (liang), it is useful to  examine disputes in which a person’s membership might be challenged (see  Waterson 1995b).  Like other Austronesian peoples, Toraja often make use of botanical idi- oms to talk about kinship. As in the chant above, the descendants of the house  are described as bamboo shoots, clumps of bamboos and coconuts, numerous  yet springing from the same source. That source is the house, which is the  site of their unity, the place for discussion and agreement among kin, and  the place to which all the descendants must return in order to celebrate ritu- als. Toraja also share with other Austronesian peoples a pattern of ideas in  which the house is thought of as a living thing, whose proper construction  and well-being become intimately entwined with the vitality and well-being  of its inhabitants.2 Botanical metaphors combine rather characteristically with  images of wealth and heirloom valuables: the bamboo shoots are ‘golden’,  that is precious, the descendants are numerous, beautiful and united like the  hundreds of beads in an heirloom ornament. This combination of images  of the natural and the man-made is not as contradictory as it might appear.  The tree of wealth, the world-tree that unites the upper-, middle- and under- worlds, is a familiar image in Toraja culture, one that also recurs across  Southeast Asia and resonates with the Hindu image of the tree of the world.  Tato’ Dena’ described a tree growing from the earth right up to the sky, which  was used by Puang Matua, the ‘Old Lord’ of the heavens, to make a carved  boat. It had three trunks, each bearing a different kind of leaf in the form of  precious cloths: maa, seleng and posirrin. This was the: Kayu bilandek, sangbara’ lino Tangke datunna, tallu daunna Tree growing from earth to heaven, tree as old as the earth itself With magnificent trunks, and three [kinds of] leaves. Sandalwood (sendana) and banyan (barana’) trees are particularly sacred to  the Toraja, and the association of trees and wealth recurs in other invocations  such as the merok chant recorded by Van der Veen (1965:21, verse 15). The  2 A comparative study of these ideas can be found in Waterson (1990, 2003).

Hail to this richly laden tjendana [sandalwood] tree,  Abundant be the blessing upon this tree, whose branches are full of precious  things.  The house itself is both tree and not-tree, natural and man-made: it is a recon- stituted tree, whose vital power must be domesticated through the perform- ance of the correct rituals which accompany every stage of felling, working  and reassembling it in the form of house timbers. One might recall the lack of  separation between what we should regard as the animate and the inanimate,  in the myth we encountered which featured a tree who is really a carpenter,  making timbers for houses endowed with the power of movement. Like the  tree of wealth, the house should be full of heirloom valuables, and when a  house ceremony is held to celebrate the completion of rebuilding, these will  be taken out and hung on the house façade and front pillar, so that it really  does have its ‘branches full of precious things’. Further on in the chant, this  tree, to which the buffalo to be sacrificed is to be bound, is associated with  humans in a remarkable way: it is described as having human blood, and  sharing the life-fluid of the people of the earth (kayu ma’rara tau [...] kayu  ma’lomba’ to lino) (Van der Veen 1965:153, verse 778). Nooy-Palm (1988:40)  even notes that many tongkonan are called after trees. We may conclude that  an intimate symbolic association exists between trees, houses, people and  wealth.  Houses, land and graves Property and valuables owned by a house are called mana’. Most tongkonan  hold some property which is regarded as indivisible; this includes resources  such as bamboo and coconut groves, as well as rice fields. Part of the wealth  of an aristocratic tongkonan was made up of heirloom valuables such as old  swords and krises, beaded kandaure ornaments, large circular gold ornaments  called lola’, and textiles. In past times, as we have seen, it also included slaves  (kaunan).  How does land become categorized as mana’? This happens most often  when a childless person designates part of their land to become tongkonan  property instead of being divided among the heirs. The family that resides  Boek Waterson.indb   177 27-1-2009   8:23:02 </page> <page sequence="6"> 178 Paths and rivers in the tongkonan will work it and has a right to the produce, except when it  is needed to meet expenses such as the renewal of the tongkonan roof. There  seem to be wide variations in the extent and importance of mana’ lands. Pak  Ulia Salu Rapa’, for instance, the leading nobleman of Nanggala, declared  that all important tongkonan had mana’, but in Saluputti, I found that many  origin houses had little or no mana’; some houses that had held mana’ had  redivided it among the descendants at some point in the past. This makes it  difficult to assess how much the occasional dubious, or contested, assertion  of membership in a tongkonan might be prompted by the desire to claim a  share in control of such lands. In a broader sense, named rice fields remain  associated with particular houses as they are passed down from parents to  children, and although these may not be designated as mana’ in the strict  sense, they are also thought of as the inheritance of the descendants of a  particular house. To be a true tongkonan member, one needs to know not only  genealogies and the names of ancestors, but also the names of the rice fields  and how they have been inherited. Otherwise one is not equipped to defend  them against any false claims to ownership. Land is very rarely sold outright,  and hardly anyone holds individual title to land; it is really use rights that are  inherited. If one person allows land to pass out of the family (for instance, by  pawning it to meet a gambling debt, or allowing a false claim to be made on  it), the anger of other family members will be aroused. An acquaintance who  worked as a school teacher in town was quick to demonstrate his knowledge  of the names of rice fields and their owners around his home village, when  another man tried to make a claim on a rice field inherited by his mother.  Another friend suspected a relative of embroidering his version of the geneal- ogy of a house from which they were both descended with a view to claiming  shares in tongkonan land. All tongkonan also have their own liang – family tombs carved out of solid  rock, which are used over generations. Membership in the house also gives  one the right of burial in its tombs. The house and the grave are often referred  to as a pair (sipasang), an idea accentuated by the imagery of ritual verses  in which the grave is called the ‘house of the ancestors’, or ‘house without  smoke, village where no fire is lit’ (tongkonan tangmerambu, tondok tangdukku  apinna). Anyone who really knows their genealogy also knows in which liang  particular ancestors are buried, and, if the ancestor is distinguished enough,  even their precise position within the burial chamber. Today, as many stone  graves are running out of space, Christians especially may opt for another  style of tomb, the patane, which is easier and cheaper to make, being dug  out of the earth and lined with concrete, often with a miniature house built  on top. This style of grave has been traditional in Kesu’ and Tikala, and is a  common sight in the Mamasa Toraja region to the west of Tana Toraja. Over  the last decade or so, they have sprung up around the countryside in other  Boek Waterson.indb   178 27-1-2009   8:23:02 </page> <page sequence="7"> IX  Trunk and branch 179 Family tombs (liang) carved into granite boulders, Malimbong, 1979 districts too, now usually executed entirely in concrete and surmounted by  an elaborate, painted model tongkonan on top in place of the older style of  wooden house. Tombs are often named after the person who originally made  or commissioned them; liangna Dondan (‘Dondan’s liang’), for instance, refers  to the original maker and not to any particular famous ancestor buried inside.  All those directly descended from the maker of a tomb have a right to be bur- ied there, but lateral kin (for instance, descendants of the maker’s siblings) do  not, unless they have intermarried.  Given that people can trace ties to more than one house, it follows that  they also usually have a choice of potential burial places. The finality of  this choice, however, makes it more problematic than one’s allegiances to  houses in life. One may easily maintain ties with many houses during one’s  life, and one may well reside in a house which is not one’s house of origin,  but at death one must rest in one place. Acute feelings of shame are aroused  by the thought of being placed in a tomb where one has no right to be; but  even without this rare possibility, there may be a debate, more or less heated,  whenever someone dies, about where they should be buried.3 Occasionally,  two sides of the family may even come to blows over which of them shall  3 Examples are discussed in Waterson (1995b).

At first, I thought that perhaps the concern with  placement of the dead might represent a desire to maximize the accumula- tion of ancestors as a way of posthumously expanding the boundaries of the  rapu, the group of a tongkonan’s descendants. This is exactly what happens,  for example, among the Merina of Madagascar, another Austronesian- speaking people with a bilateral kinship system whose culture is marked by  Indonesian influences. The choice of a tomb is of tremendous importance  here, too, only the decision has to be made earlier, since individuals must  join an association to help pay for its upkeep. Tombs are grandiose struc- tures, far more magnificent than the houses of the living, so the commitment  is an expensive one. Bloch (1971a) describes how the localized kin group,  or deme, among the Merina achieves its ideal form only within the tomb,  where relatives cannot marr its unity by quarrelling. But Toraja denied any  conscious concern to enlarge the kin group associated with the house in this  way – which fits, in fact, with the extreme fluidity of rapu boundaries among  the living. The intensity of emotions aroused by these questions has rather  to do with the complex of ideas regarding the reciprocal responsibilities  between the living and the dead: the living tend the remains of their ances- tors, periodically re-wrapping the bones and making offerings at the tomb,  while the ancestors for their part are supposed to benefit the living. This is  why such great importance is attached to preserving the bones of the dead,  for without doing so, one cannot secure blessings from them.  We see, therefore, that people’s allegiances to each other in the Toraja kin- ship system involve not only their bonds to houses, viewed as origin-sites, but  also a web of ties with land, graves, and ancestors, which situate individuals  in relation to place and to each other. These powerfully emotive bonds give  rise to feelings of family honour (longko’) which are perceived to be uniquely  Toraja; they are often distinguished as such by being termed longko’ Toraya.  Toraja tend to compare longko’ with the Bugis and Makassar concept of siri’,  which Millar (1989:225) has defined as ‘a strong sense of honour that is par- ticularly important vis-à-vis kinship ties’. They may even borrow the word  siri’ to talk about it, but it is clear from what is said that longko’ differs signifi- cantly from siri’. Longko’ can refer as much to feelings of shame in relation to  other family members as to feelings between families. Among the Bugis, siri’  will be provoked when someone else makes a public attack on an individual’s  honour. But for the Toraja, feelings of shame (kalongkoran) are equally elicited  by a sense of one’s failure to do the right thing, especially if one then incurs  the scorn of other family members. When I asked people what circumstances  were likely to give rise to feelings of longko’, they emphasized failures of  responsibility – failure to rebuild an origin house, to pay an inherited funeral  Boek Waterson.indb   180 27-1-2009   8:23:03 </page> <page sequence="9"> IX  Trunk and branch 181 debt, or to show sufficient concern over the placement of the dead.4  One question which is not entirely easy to answer is to what extent, in the  past, commoners’ ties to their local aristocratic tongkonan may have had impor- tance relative to their ties to their own houses. The impressive ceremonies of  the ‘eastern’ sphere, connected with fertility-enhancement, always focus on a  leading noble house which holds the key ritual offices involved, but require  the cooperation and labour of the whole community. Likewise, the large-scale  mortuary celebrations staged for high-ranking individuals would be impossi- ble without the labour contributions of the whole community. Villagers make  up a noble’s entourage when he attends a death feast; they carry the pigs and  other contributions, and expect to receive meat for their trouble. Although the  severest penalties (of death or banishment) were enforced in the past against  unions between high-ranking women and low-ranking men, no such rules  applied to men, and many noblemen married or had unofficial liaisons with  commoner or even slave women, giving rise to people of mixed rank who  could trace a tie with a ruling tongkonan. Some even claim that the tana’ bassi,  or lower nobility, came into being as the result of marriages between nobles  and commoners. Evidence from the more hierarchical central and southern  areas is conflicting on the question of whether the offspring of such marriages  were obliged to follow the rank of the mother, or were deemed to belong to  an intermediate rank (Nooy-Palm 1979:48). In Saluputti, I was told that the  latter was the case. According to one acquaintance, if such a person were to  be ordered about, he might retort, ‘Please cut me in half! Half of me may  be a slave, but the other half has the right to sit here with you!’ At any rate,  it is safe to assume that a certain number of people of lower rank would be  able to trace ties with the ruling tongkonan in most areas, and that this would  tend to strengthen their allegiance to this house as well as to their own origin  houses. Where chiefs exercised their powers very arbitrarily over the people  and their possessions, on the other hand, fear may have played a part in bind- ing people to the ruling house. But so long as empty land was available to  be brought under cultivation, the possibility for people to move away from  exploitative chiefs must have remained an option. This indeed is said to be  how Saluputti came to be settled in the first place, and why its nobles call  themselves Ma’dika (‘Free’ or ‘Independent’).  4 It fits with the different focus of priorities in these two societies that, whereas Bugis  weddings provide the quintessential occasions for the display of ‘self-esteem’ (Bugis use the  Indonesian term harga diri, which Millar suggests is even more crucial than siri’ for an under- standing of status distinctions), Toraja longko’ centers on the two contexts of the house, and of  mortuary celebrations.  Boek Waterson.indb   181 27-1-2009   8:23:03 </page> <page sequence="10"> 182 Paths and rivers Metaphors of origin: the trunk and the tip Austronesian societies recurrently make use of a particular idiom to talk  about origins, using reflexes of a term that means ‘base’ or ‘trunk’ of a tree,  by extension also ‘source’, ‘origin’, ‘beginning’ or ‘cause’. This term is paired  with one that means ‘tip’ or ‘shoot’, such that the growth of kin groups,  or the founding of houses, are thought of in terms of the growth of a tree.  Descending generations, or newly founded houses, branch off as so many  ‘tips’ from their original ‘trunk’.5 The imagery of ‘trunk’ and ‘tip’ thus works  not just to describe spatial relationships (as in rules for the correct placement  of house timbers) but as a means of describing a diachronic relationship, of  talking about time.6 The botanical metaphor of continuity and growth also  implies a relationship of precedence, and recognition of the ‘source’ will often  be given formal expression in rituals. In Toraja, the word used for the trunk  or base is most commonly oto’ or garonto’, while the tip is lolok.7  Toraja sometimes contrast founding and branch houses as ‘trunk’ and ‘tip’  (oto’na/lolokna) or less commonly as ‘trunk’ and ‘branch’ (garonto’na/tangkena);  sometimes they are termed ‘mother’ and ‘child’ (indo’na/anakna), or the origi- nal founding house may be termed ongi’na (ongi’: ‘stem’, as in the stem of a  fruit; na: possessive, ‘its’.) When demonstrating this idea, one person picked  up a mangosteen, another a coconut, pointing out how ‘the whole fruit grows  from the stem’. This latter term is without a pair to indicate the branch house.  When people recount their genealogies, they begin, as we have seen, with  a founding couple. They go on to tell who were their children, whom they  married, and where they moved to in order to found new ‘branch’ houses of  their own. The most detailed accounts also include details of named super- natural heirloom valuables that were taken along by each descendant as  their inheritance. At the same time as details of their genealogies sometimes  become forgotten, Toraja preserve very precise recall of their links to houses,  and of these houses’ links to each other; as I have suggested, one could sketch  out a genealogy of houses underpinning the entire kinship system and the  5 Terms for ‘trunk’ are frequently cognate with Proto-Austronesian *puhun or *puqun (Wurm  and Wilson 1975:13, 225). See Lewis (1988) on ‘trunk’ and ‘tip’ metaphors among the Ata Tana  Ai (Flores); Traube (1986, 1989) on the Mambai of East Timor; and Fox (1995, 1996) for detailed  comparative discussion of the occurrence of these ideas in other Austronesian societies, includ- ing the Atoni, the Balinese, and the Oceanic peoples of Palau, Anuta and Tikopia. Fox (1995:37)  points out that the Toraja term rapu, which is used to refer to a group of house descendants as  well as to the branching base of a bamboo culm, finds a parallel in some Northern Philippine  societies where a term constructable as *rapu is used to mean ‘origin’, ‘base’, ‘source’. 6 Compare Traube (1989). 7 To do something completely (for instance, to carry out a sequence of rituals, as for house  building) can also be described as movement from trunk to tip: dipasundun rekke lolokna, ‘com- pleted right up to the tip’.

But just as human genealogies are full of  variations and may be used to support contested claims to precedence in the  present, so too the genealogies of houses represent a useable past, which may  be brought into service in support of current interests.  As the fortunes of their descendants rise and fall, houses may gain pres- tige by being repeatedly renewed over time, as well as by being the site of  rituals. A three-dimensional carved buffalo head (kabongo’), often with real  horns, indicates that the highest ranking level of funeral has been celebrated;  a long-necked bird (katik), sometimes described as a cock but more correctly  representing a hornbill, is a sign that the great ma’bua’ rite has been held.8  Other decorative elements, such as the tuang-tuang (sections of fine bamboos  hung on long strings, which are only used at highest-ranking funerals) are  hung around the rice barn. Becoming part of the built structure, these items  communicate part of the house’s history and augment its prestige. But houses  may also be struck by disasters such as fire, or fall into disrepair; the fortunes  of an older house may be eclipsed by a branch house whose members have  prospered. So each house comes to have a life history of its own, one that is  intertwined with the lives of its human inhabitants, but which can outlast  all of them. Comparative ethnography shows us that this growing together  of houses and their human inhabitants is a distinctive characteristic of many  Austronesian societies, where the house, identified initially with the conjugal  couple who establish their own hearth, has integrated into it both the placen- tae of those born there, and the spiritual presence of those who have become  ancestors, until it comes to encompass both endings and beginnings, and  the lives not only of present, but also past and future members.9 Enduring  beyond its individual members and their enterprises, it offers them a sort of  immortality which would otherwise escape them. The ‘life’ of the house The idea of the house as having a life of its own is more than just a metaphor  for the Toraja, as for other Southeast Asian peoples. To say that it is ‘alive’ is  to grant the house its own subjectivity, and make of it a communicable-with  entity. The interaction between humans and houses must then be regulated to  ensure a harmonious balance between their respective vitalities. These ideas  are reflected in conceptions of the house as body, and the need for the proper  performance of rituals associated with it. 8 See Waterson (1989). Waterson (1988) treats the meanings of house carving motifs in  detail. 9 See Waterson (2003) for a fuller comparative discussion.

As in many other Austronesian societies, the placenta is regarded  as a sort of twin (a perception which is in fact genetically correct). Over time,  the house thus becomes the place where ‘many placentae are buried’ (buda  lamunan lolo), and should therefore, so I was told, never be moved from its  original site.10 As we have seen, some house sites, even when vacant, may be  remembered for centuries. To say that a person ‘knows where their placentae  are buried’ (untandai lamunan lolona) is a way of saying that they know their  links to ancestral tongkonan, and will therefore be able to keep up these links  properly, for instance by contributing if any of these houses is being rebuilt.  Nowadays, lamented Tato’ Dena’, many people do not know where their  placentae are buried, causing ties to houses to be lost; people ‘lose their way’,  and thus ‘history is broken’.11 The act of burying the placental twin binds the  newborn person to their house of birth, for it is said that no matter how far  they may wander, they will always eventually want to return to that place.  The sense of belonging to the house group and having its interests at heart  is reflected, too, when it is said of someone who talks indiscreetly and can’t  keep family secrets that ‘they must have forgotten to bury his placenta!’  But the house is not only important as the site of births. Pak Kila’ put it this  way: ‘The house is like our mother, because we are born there and die there,  and seventy per cent of our activities are carried on there.’ For this reason,  he added, one should never do wrong in the house. Ne’ Barokko, an elderly  man from Nanggala, echoed these thoughts: ‘In Toraja, the house is the cen- tre of everything, because everything important is done there – it’s where we  conceive our children, where we eat our food, it’s where we think, it’s where  we celebrate rituals.’ Pak Kondo of Maulu in Saluputti likewise expressed a  maternal image of the house: ‘The house is the mother (starting-point, origin)  of our search for a livelihood and of the birth of children’ (iatu banua, indo’na  dakkaran kande sia dadian bati’). The image of the house as mother is carried  over in the common saying that the house is to the rice barn as mother to  father, or wife to husband. House (banua) and barn (alang) make a pair, the  one facing north, and the other in front of it, with its door facing south. A  house without a barn is incomplete, and may be said to be lacking a spouse  (tae’ balinna). In a marriage, the woman is in fact often directly associated with  the house because it is built on her family land, the majority of marriages  being uxorilocal. In case of divorce, she retains the house, while the husband  may be permitted to take the rice barn as his share. Unlike a house, there is  no inhibition against moving a barn to another site. One person commented  10 According to Isak Tandirerung, people in the Saluputti area are more emphatic about the  importance of not moving houses than in other areas such as Rantepao. 11 Here he used Indonesian, saying putus sejarah.

The house as mother, however, is said  to take precedence over rice barns, which are compared to her children. One  should always build the house first, before the rice barn. ‘The house holds the  barn in its lap’ (banua ria alang) poetically expresses the protective image of a  mother-child pair, a pair which is certainly not oppositional, nor even exactly  complementary, but rather organically related. The coexistence of these dif- ferent images, with their varied nuances, may be seen as typical of symbolism  in many South-East Asian societies, and cautions us against a too simplistic  arrangement of structural oppositions. One can also conclude that an asso- ciation exists between the ideas ‘mother’ and ‘trunk, origin’.12 Indo’ can also  mean ‘leader’, and is used, regardless of their actual gender, as a title given to  several ritual functionaries; an example is the Indo’ Padang or ‘Leader of the  Land’, who coordinates the rites associated with the agricultural cycle.13  When we look at the structure of the house, we find that anthropomor- phic imagery, though not as elaborately or as systematically applied to the  house as in some Indonesian communities, is certainly present.14 The gable  triangle (para) is often referred to as the house’s ‘face’ (lindo banua), and the  pair of sunburst designs at the top of the triangle are compared to eyes. In  northern parts of Toraja (for example around Palawa), houses often have the  sunburst designs repeated in the bottom corners of the triangle, and I was  told that these are like breasts. Another anthropomorphized building element  is the a’riri posi’ or ‘navel post’ which is a feature only of very high ranking  tongkonan, for which the most complete set of rituals has been performed.  Such a house is sometimes termed banua diposi’ or ‘house with a navel’. The  post is not essential structurally, for in fact it is inserted after the house has  already been built; but its symbolic significance is considerable. It rests on  a flat stone and is jointed into one of the main floor beams; it aligns with a  central pillar inside the house which becomes the focus of the most important  fertility-enhancing ritual, the ma’bua’ (see Chapter XV). In Saluputti, the post  is personified as either ‘male’ or ‘female’, depending on whether the main  founding ancestor of the house was a man or a woman. (Although the house  is always founded by a married couple, the primary founder will be regarded  as the one on whose family land the house is built.) Occasionally, the sex of  the post is used to symbolize a ‘paired’ relationship between two related ori- 12 The same association is made explicitly in some other Southeast Asian societies. The Temiar  of Malaysia are one example (Geoffrey Benjamin, personal communication). 13 These rites are discussed in Chapter XV. 14 See Hicks (1976:56); Kana (1980:228); and Forth (1981:29) for some especially elaborate  examples of anthropomorphism in house structures in other Indonesian societies.

Tongkonan  Talonge’ in Ulusalu has a ‘female’ a’riri’ posi’ carved with three-dimensional  breasts; this house is also unique, so far as I know, in having a similar pair of  breasts projecting from the façade. When the timber for the navel post is cut,  it must be carried from the forest with its ‘head’ end always held up higher  than its ‘trunk’ end. A special ritual is held for its installation, at which it must  be appropriately dressed in either a male or a female sarong and headcloth.  Tato’ Dena’ explained that the navel post is like the ‘heart’ of the house  (ate banua; ate: literally ‘liver’), and that its installation ritual is designed to  ‘bring it to life’ so that, like the house itself, it will have sumanga’. Sumanga’  (a cognate of Malay semangat) is an element of vitality or ‘soul’, which in the  animist belief systems of Southeast Asia is considered to be shared by every- thing, including what westerners would regard as inanimate objects.15 Toraja  also use the term deata more or less interchangeably to describe this vitality.  At the installation ceremony, Tato’ Dena’ would perform a chant summoning  the deities and the ancestors, and telling the history of how the first house  was built in the sky, Tangdilino’’s founding of the first earthly tongkonan at  Banua Puan, and the stories of the other original houses that could move by  themselves, as recounted in Chapter VII. Once again, then, we find that the  occasion for telling these marvellous tales of the past is a ritual in which the  telling reaffirms the status of a noble house, of which the a’riri posi’ itself is a  sign.16 Since the house has a life of its own, if it is ever pulled down, it must  be symbolically ‘stabbed’ first before being dismantled. Not to do so would  show a lack of respect for the life of the house, personified in ritual poetry as  a guardian spirit (deata sikambi’ bangunan banua). The two senses of deata, as  vitality, or as personified spirit, are here in effect indistinguishable. In a more  general way, we can say that it is the process of construction itself, coupled  with the execution of the associated rituals, which ‘brings the house to life’  and endows it with a power of its own. The symbolic stabbing, while it marks  the end of that particular manifestation of the house, is not actually a death  of the house per se, since the demolition is usually occasioned by a plan for  rebuilding. Perhaps the spirit of the old house must be released so that it can  later be reincorporated in the new one. The personification of the house as body has implications for its construc- tion. Faults in the construction process would endanger the integrity of this  body and thus place the inhabitants at risk. It appears to be universal in  Indonesian societies that rules must be followed about the placement of the  15 Sumanga’ is discussed more fully in Waterson (2003). 16 Since this chant has the power to summon the deities and ancestors, he was unwilling to do  more than give a brief outline of it, out of context. It would be dangerous to call them if you are  not making offerings.

Posts must invari- ably be ‘planted’ with their root ends down, so that the wood is aligned in the  same direction that it was when growing in the tree. The ordering of beams  is not a neutral matter either, though precise rules vary in different cultures.  In Toraja, house beams must be placed so that two ‘trunk’ ends meet in the  southwest corner and two ‘tips’ in the northeast corner. The east is the direc- tion associated with life and the rising sun, as well as with the deities (deata),  north with the creator deity Puang Matua. South and west by contrast have  associations with death and the ancestors. Ambe’ Tasik, a carpenter from  Ullin in Saluputti district, explained that the ‘growing’ end of the tree must  face the direction of life because humans themselves must seek life and ori- ent themselves toward it. The house as a whole also has a ‘trunk’ and ‘tip’.  The rear or south end of the house is the ‘trunk’; the south room or sumbung  is the place where house heirlooms and valuables are customarily stored in  baskets or boxes, and where the householders sleep. The middle room, sali,  is for general use (and formerly contained the hearth, situated on the eastern  side, the side associated with life and with the deities), while children and  guests would sleep in the northernmost room, the tangdo’, at the ‘tip’ end of  the house.17 If posts or beams are inverted or incorrectly placed, this is likely  to cause sickness, misfortune or even death. These rules suggest that the  house is imagined not just in terms of a human body, but also of a reconsti- tuted tree, whose life continues in a new form: the original and wild vitality  of the tree must be properly channeled and domesticated, as house timbers,  for the house to have a beneficial effect on its occupants.18 Nowadays a lot of  the wood used in house construction comes from commercial lumber yards in  Palopo, so I wondered if it was always easy to tell which was the ‘trunk’ end  of the timbers, but carpenters assured me that you could tell by weighing it:  the ‘trunk’ end will be denser and heavier. Ambe’ Tasik explained how wood for a barn cannot be taken at the same  time as that for a house, and must not come from the same tree. Rules about  the placement of house members form part of the ‘ordering of the house’  (susunan banua). The house ‘grows’ as you build it up, as a tree grows tall, and  so the timbers must be arranged that way too. The living always lie down to  sleep facing east to west, but at a certain point in the funeral rites, a dead per- son is turned so that their head is to the south. Most people explain that this is  because they must journey to the south in order to reach the afterlife, Puya, but  17 Volkman (1985:47) reports being told by a to minaa of Sesean that the ‘roots’ of the house  must be ‘fertilised’ by the presence of heirloom cloths and swords in the sumbung, so that the  ‘branches and leaves’ (the front of the house with its ornate façade) will be beautiful. 18 For comparative examples, see Gibbs (1987:79) on the Malays, and Teljeur (1990:65, 83) on  the Giman of Halmahera.

Some rules of orientation, on the other hand, seem to have a purely practical  basis. Firewood should be put in the fire with its trunk end first, but people  say this is because the wood at that end is drier and burns better. Speaking of  the construction of the tongkonan roof with its extraordinary extended eaves,  Ambe’ Tasik explained that the members from which these extensions are built  upward and outward from the ridge beam must be arranged with their ‘trunk’  ends pointing out, because that end is denser and stronger.  Other errors may also endanger the future occupants of a house. He  described how, when his family origin house was being rebuilt, his father  looked at the house posts after they had been erected and decided they were  too tall. He then ordered the carpenters to cut off the tops. After that, Ambe’  Tasik’s elder brother declared, ‘I refuse to live here! Can a person walk with  his head cut off?’ He moved elsewhere, but the father took up residence in  the newly completed house. However, he was constantly sick, until at last he  too felt obliged to move, after which the house stood empty for thirty years.  Another prohibition, or pemali, is on making the central room (sali) of a three- room house smaller than the others.

In  Kesu’ it is said that a door post must not run straight up to the roof, but must  terminate at the overhead lintel. Otherwise it would be like a person with  their arm stuck up in the air, with the lintel like an obstruction in the armpit,  preventing free movement of the arm; again, bad results can be predicted  for the occupants. Even Christians, I was told, dare not break these rules.  However, they are most likely to be activated as explanations when things  go wrong. Then people will question whether faults in construction might be  responsible for their ill fortune, and take steps to correct things. Over time, the power of the house accumulates as more life is lived in  it and its association with the protective presence of the ancestors becomes  stronger. In the end its timbers themselves come to share in this power, a  perception which has both positive and negative aspects. In some areas it is  customary, if a house is being rebuilt, to re-use some, or even just one, of the  old timbers ‘so that the embrace of the ancestors may remain strong’ (na mato- tok pangria to dolona), and the continuity of well-being assured. On the other  hand, some carpenters are wary of working with such old timbers, fearing  that they may be too powerful and dislike being moved. In 1994, I was told  about the rebuilding of a house in Kata, a neighbouring hamlet of Buttang.  The owners planned to re-use some of the timbers from the old house, but the  carpenter fell suddenly ill and died while he was still working on the house.  His death was attributed to the powers of the old wood. The house and the rapu The word tongkonan is derived from the verb tongkon, ‘to sit’ or ‘to attend’;  it is the place where members meet to discuss family affairs, attend ceremo- nies, or arrange for the upkeep of the house itself. In principle, everyone is  connected to origin houses, whatever their rank – as Malle’ of Malimbong  put it, ‘even the birds have their tongkonan’. But I also found that the word is  commonly used in a more restricted sense, to refer only to the finely carved  houses with their impressive curved roofs which in pre-colonial times had  represented the political power of the nobility. It was sometimes claimed  that the number of tongkonan, in this sense of ruling aristocratic houses, must  have become fixed at some time in the past, and that there could be no new  ones today. In Saluputti, people were sometimes offended if I referred to  ordinary houses by the term tongkonan. Origin houses in the most general  sense, regardless of rank, are most often called banua pa’rapuan, ‘house of  the pa’rapuan’. Those who trace descent from a common pair of ancestors are  called the rapu or pa’rapuan. Although the primary meaning of rapu refers  to the kinship grouping, Toraja frequently draw comparisons between the  Boek Waterson.indb   191 27-1-2009   8:23:05 </page> <page sequence="20"> 192 Paths and rivers group of descendants and a culm of bamboo (tallang), whose many, rapidly- growing stems sprout from a single clump. Rapu tallang denotes both a  bamboo culm and an ideally large family group, multiplying and expanding  like the bamboo. From the same root comes an adjective, marapuan, mean- ing ‘having a great many descendants’. In Saluputti, the term rapu is used  more commonly than pa’rapuan, though they are regarded as synonymous;  rapu refers rather generally to kin. Depending on context, it may sometimes  be used to refer to all the descendants of a tongkonan, sometimes to a group  of siblings and their descendants. In other districts such as Kesu’, the rapu  was described as a branch of the pa’rapuan, though how these branches are  defined depends entirely on context. In daily life, rapu are not much talked  of and are of little relevance. They do not, for instance, form the basis for  agricultural work groups, which are generally formed among neighbours.  In a general way, the term rapunta (‘[a member of] our rapu’) may be used  synonymously with solata (literally, ‘one of us’), to indicate relatives within  one’s immediate circle, up to second or third cousins (though these terms can  easily be extended to include more distant relatives, a tendency that will be  further examined in the following chapter). Migrant Toraja, people pointed  out, will tend to seek out members of the rapu to stay with, but this is really  to say no more than that people look for kin of any description when they are  in a strange place, and one man who had returned home after working for an  oil company in Kalimantan described how any Toraja would call each other  solata in that context.  Nooy-Palm (1979:22) has labeled the pa’rapuan ‘a cognatic descent group  or ramage’, calling the rapu a ‘sub-ramage’. Although the term ‘ramage’ was  coined by Firth to describe kinship groupings in Tikopia, it is interesting to  note that this was how he chose to translate the Tikopia term paito; but what  paito literally means is ‘house’. In the light of a new recognition of the poten- tials for analysis presented by the house as a social institution, we might well  now wish that he had remained true to Tikopian terminology. In Tikopia,  however, membership in either the mother’s or the father’s paito is restricted  by criteria such as residence, so that while the system is clearly flexible it  tends to produce a marked patrilineal bias. This does not accord with my  experience of the Toraja system, which shows every evidence of a thorough- going bilaterality. I therefore find the term ‘ramage’ to be misleading, for it  implies a more bounded and lineal grouping than is really the case.  Rapu in fact are contingent groups of no fixed composition or leadership.  They are activated only on specific occasions: the arrangement of ceremonies,  inheritance, or the rebuilding of a house. If it is a matter of inheritance, it must  be decided who has the right to a share of property (and the consequent duty  of making buffalo sacrifices during the deceased person’s mortuary rites).  When the decision is taken to rebuild an origin house, the descendants will  Boek Waterson.indb   192 27-1-2009   8:23:05 </page> <page sequence="21"> IX  Trunk and branch 193 select one particular married couple at some point in their genealogy, and  then all the children of that ancestral couple will be treated as heads of rapu.  If one of these individuals has married twice, this will create two rapu, the  descendants of each marriage being considered separately. The costs will then  be divided between the descendants of each of these. For the rebuilding of  large and important aristocratic houses, a point some generations back in the  genealogy may be selected, in which case there may be hundreds of descend- ants from whom contributions can be collected. For smaller banua pa’rapuan,  a group of siblings may manage a rebuilding project among themselves,  treating themselves as heads of rapu and sharing the costs, with the help of  contributions from their adult children. If there are too few siblings to make  this feasible, they may go back a further generation in the genealogy and take  their grandparents as a starting-point for the rapu, in order to draw in more  distant cousins. On a future occasion, a different ancestral couple may be  selected, changing the composition of the rapu. When Pattan, the tongkonan  layuk of Ulusalu, was renewed in the early 1980s, a point five generations  back in the genealogy of this house was selected. The complete genealogy has  a depth of twenty-four generations, beginning with a grandson of the mythi- cal Tamboro Langi’. The couple selected in this case, Napa’ and Mandoa,  were inhabiting the tongkonan at the time when the Dutch entered Toraja in  1906. Napa’, an only child, was selected by the Dutch as parengnge’ (chief) of  Ulusalu, though her husband Mandoa, who was older than she and a cousin,  carried out most of the functions of this office. The five children of Napa’ and  Mandoa were thus singled out as heads of rapu, and all their descendants  were requested to help with the rebuilding. The complete genealogy shows  a certain amount of ‘shedding’ or forgetting of the descendants of those who  did not remain resident in the house, but clearly this process takes several  generations to occur. Tracing just the direct line of tongkonan residents, who  would have acted as family heads and political leaders, we find a total of nine  women and thirteen men. The majority of these (seventeen out of twenty- two) were first-born children. Although this bias was not noticeable in other  genealogies that I collected, my informant, Y.B. Tandirerung, suggested that  age had given them some advantage over their siblings in establishing them- selves in this role. Ta’do, in Talion, is a house which has more recently achieved the status of  tongkonan among its descendants, having been founded by the grandparents  of the present occupant. This house was also rebuilt in the early 1980s. Indo’  Rembon, who resides there, belongs to a sibling group comprising seven sis- ters and a brother, of whom she is the second youngest. It was she, however,  who was responsible for the plan and who, over the course of repeated fam- ily meetings, succeeded in overcoming the initial reluctance of her siblings  to undertake the expense of rebuilding. In this instance, the sibling group  Boek Waterson.indb   193 27-1-2009   8:23:05 </page> <page sequence="22"> 194 Paths and rivers treated themselves as heads of rapu, for all now have numerous children and  grandchildren of their own. The carpenters were paid eight buffaloes for the  construction of this house. In principle, costs are divided equally between the  rapu, but considerable adjustments may be made to allow for the different  numbers of people in each rapu and their relative ability to contribute. In this  case, contributions were not demanded from the children of the eldest sister,  already deceased. None were sufficiently well-off, and some were too young,  to be able to contribute significantly. Since Indo’ Rembon’s family were the  ones who would have the benefit of actually living in the house, it was agreed  that she and her children would pay four buffaloes out of the total eight. She  also paid for the materials. Sale of the wood from the old house brought two  buffaloes, one of which was also put toward the cost. The remaining three  buffaloes were paid by the other rapu, each of the other six surviving siblings  paying half a buffalo each. Returning for a visit in 1982, I was able to witness  the transformation of the small, old tongkonan in which I had often stayed  previously into a fashionable modern house, a hybrid structure consisting of  a spacious, square first storey in ‘Bugis’ style with large doors and louvred- glass windows, topped by a second storey shaped like the traditional tongko- nan, with carved exterior, curved roof ridge and projecting eaves. At the rear,  a concrete-floored kitchen, bathroom and toilet had been built on. Returning  in 1994, I found two fine new rice barns had been built beside the house and  preparations were in hand to hold a ritual to celebrate the completion of con- struction. We can trace here something of the process by which a house comes  to attain the status of origin house for its descendants. The pattern whereby the resident pays a larger share of the costs is com- mon, especially for houses of moderate wealth or importance. It can also hap- pen that virtually all the costs are met by a descendant who no longer lives  in Tana Toraja at all, but who chooses this means of converting new wealth  into status at home. That this is something still widely admired and expected  in Tana Toraja is evidenced by the amount of rebuilding that is continually  in process. Remoter members of the pa’rapuan may take less interest in the  construction, but all have the right to attend the ensuing house ceremony  (mangrara banua), publicly affirming their membership of the house by the  gift of a sacrificial pig. Unlike funerals, where pigs and buffaloes are typically  presented to the hosts by their affines, at the house ceremony the emphasis is  on pigs in particular, and it is descendants of the house who bring them. In  the case of very important tongkonan, to which many branch houses claim  a link, the rapu groups attending the ceremony will be numerous; at least a  hundred such groups attended the celebration of the rebuilding of tongkonan  Nonongan, for instance, in 1983. From the above description it will have become clear that there are many  possibilities for the definition of rapu. There is no neat correlation between  Boek Waterson.indb   194 27-1-2009   8:23:05 </page> <page sequence="23"> IX  Trunk and branch 195 any one house and a rapu, for the descendants of one tongkonan can be  divided into many rapu at will. Conversely, a rapu, if defined as starting from  a distant ancestor, might encompass several branch tongkonan of the original  house. Any individual within the rapu as thus defined would belong to some  but not all of those houses, since branch houses do not trace lateral ties with  each other unless through intermarriage. On the other hand, it is also pos- sible to ‘enter a house’ (mentama tongkonan), more than once, in other words,  one may be able to trace a tie several times over with a single house if there  has been repeated intermarriage between its descendants. This was the case  at Pattan, whose genealogy features a number of cousin marriages, preferred  in the past partly due to a desire to consolidate property within the family,  and partly due to isolation. If the reader perhaps finds this system frustrating  in its lack of clearly defined boundaries, it is interesting to note that Toraja  themselves choose to see this precisely as a strength and not a weakness  of their arrangements. One friend, recently involved in the reconstruction  of a tongkonan in Kole, Malimbong, whose costs had been equally divided  between ten rapu, commented that the bilateral tracing of ties to houses was  the great advantage that Toraja had over peoples with unilineal systems, like  the patrilineal Batak or the matrilineal Minangkabau of Sumatra. Toraja, he  pointed out, could draw on so many people to help, including both the moth- er’s and the father’s side of the family; not only that, but spouses will also be  sure to help each other out. This multiple membership in different houses is a  distinctive feature of a highly flexible, and hence remarkably durable, system.  That the house itself, as a physical structure, should be such a dramatic and  unique feat of engineering makes it an obvious source of cultural pride and  a convenient icon of ethnic identity. Where indigenous architectures in many  parts of the Indonesian archipelago have proved to be perilously vulnerable  to the forces of modernity, the renewal of Toraja tongkonan remains at present  a vigorous tradition. Hopes and dreams Once an origin house has been rebuilt, an inaugural ceremony (mangrara  banua) must be held. Mangrara means literally ‘to anoint with blood’, the  sacrifices made at the rite ensuring blessings for the house and its inhabit- ants. Since the house embodies and protects the lives of its descendants, and  indeed as I have argued, will endure beyond them and thus offers them a  kind of immortality, it is only natural that this ceremony should belong to the  Rites of East, whose purpose is to celebrate life and fertility. These themes are  expressed in it in a rather interesting way. In fact the house ceremony remains  at present the one Rite of the East that is frequently staged.

Like most other rites, this one has several levels, depending on the rank  of the owners and the style of the house itself. Tato’ Dena’ listed six of them,  from the humblest bamboo hut, said to represent the earliest effort at archi- tecture and picturesquely termed lantang to lumio’ (literally ‘a traveller’s  shelter’), to the tongkonan layuk or ‘great origin house’, those houses that  were once the centres of power in a community and the dwelling places of  ruling nobles. The consecration of each demands a slightly different chant,  though he was not prepared to recite any of them in their entirety, outside  of the proper context, since it would be dangerous to summon the deities  and ancestors for nothing. He said that a newly married couple, according to  tradition, ought to start their married life in a very simple house, and work  up to the more elaborate house types (as far as their rank permitted) over  time. In this way, the construction of a more solid house comes to embody  the consolidation of the marriage over time. Each level involves a longer list  of offerings to be made during the stages of construction, as well as on the  final days of celebration. For the lower levels, mostly chickens are offered,  but the offerings for the tongkonan layuk must be all of pigs, a minimum total  of twelve. The top three levels also enjoy the privilege of beating the drum  (ma’gandang), which for the tongkonan layuk will be beaten most frequently. It  is not my intention to describe all these in detail, since an account has already  been provided by Nooy-Palm (1979:246-52), while the part of the proceed- ings called ma’bubung, celebrating completion of the roof, has been described  in Waterson (1990:127-9). What I want to do here is to draw attention to the  expression of hopes for good fortune embodied in aspects of the rite, since  this is a theme intrinsic to Rites of the East, which will emerge again as being  of special significance in the greatest of all these rituals, the ma’bua’, described  in Chapter XV.  The chant of consecration for the house, as outlined by Tato’ Dena’, first  summons the deities (deata) and then the ancestors (to dolo) to be present. All  the deities, from the three levels of the cosmos – the sky, the earth and under  the earth – and from all points of the compass, as well as from the ‘centre of  the earth’ (tangana padang) are called; likewise all the ancestors, from the first  founders of the house until the most recently deceased. They are informed  that the aluk banua, the rite for the house, is about to be performed.

The next part of the chant is named ma’kadang tua’, ‘to hook good for- tune’, as mangoes are plucked from high branches with a long hooked pole.19  This, Tato’ Dena’ elaborated, was a form of pelambean, ‘expectation’ (of bless- ing and long life), in which a request is made to Puang Matua, the ‘Old Lord’  of the heavens, in case anyone has had an ominous dream, that he should  change it to have an auspicious meaning instead of a bad one. This process of  finding alternative, auspicious meanings for dreams of apparently unfavour- able content is called ma’tetean bori’ (‘to mark out a boundary’). The chant  continues with the consecration of a pig, which is reminded of its duty to do  as its ancestors have always done, by allowing itself to be offered. The pig  is then stabbed (dito’bok). As well as being a part of the chant, a real session  of dream-interpretation will later be presided over by the to minaa, in which  people will recount bad dreams and he will give them all positive meanings.  I draw attention to this because ma’tetean bori’ is also a feature of the ma’bua’  rite, and seems to be a particular device used in both these important rites  as a means to avert bad fortune. It is a ritual technique to ensure that the  expressed desires (pelambean) for health, prosperity and fertility, which are  the goal of all Rites of the East, shall come to pass.  Another to minaa, Ne’ Buttu of Simbulan in Ulusalu, recited for me a prayer  called passonde-sonde, which is uttered at the conclusion of the ma’tetean bori’  (Appendix A). By means of this prayer, members of the house and commu- nity are ‘cooled’ (dipasakke). In it, the house members are described as entering  deep sleep together, in the darkest part of the night. The sleepers swim in an  abundant sea (tasik mapulu’), which in dream-imagery represents a fertile rice  field full of water weeds and plants. They will dream of rows of standing  stones on the sea shore, which represent the tall stacks of newly-harvested  rice, called patuku or lampo’ (lappo’ in the dialect of Saluputti) which are made  by the reapers on the rice field banks at harvest time:20 19 The house carving design called pa’kadang has a similar meaning. 20 The poetic image of stones by the sea fascinated and puzzled me, until Tato’ Dena’ explained  to me that menhirs or standing stones were meant. In a way this is curious, since these are in  waking life so specifically associated with the rante or funeral ground, where they are erected as  memorials to the aristocratic dead. But in the dream-imagery of the poem, we find a reversal of  association, so that they now stand for the rice-stacks of a bountiful harvest, the ultimate image  of plenty and well being.

Exactly this imagery  is repeated in the ma’bua’ pare, acted out there in the making of tall cones of  sticky rice, called lappo’ because they too are intended to represent the hope  of tall rice-stacks at harvest time. These are arranged in a long row on a spe- cial structure, a decorated bamboo platform called panglamporan, extending  in a ring around the central mound of the ceremonial ground, which itself is  termed the ‘seed-bad’ (pa’mukkuran). The imagery of abundant harvests thus  lies at the heart of the Rites of the East, and finds its expression here in the  evocation of a dream of prosperity to be shared by all the descendants of the  house.
