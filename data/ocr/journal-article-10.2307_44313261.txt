<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 52, No. 4 (Summer 2003) Cosmic Anthropology: Race and Reason in Out of the Silent Planet Sanford Schwartz The most useful and least advanced of all human knowledge seems to me to be that of man [...]. For how can the source of inequality among men be known unless one begins by knowing men themselves? - Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men Something is wrong in your head, hnau from Thulcandra. There is too much blood in it. - Oyarsa of Malacandra to Weston, Out of the Silent Planet In his first venture into science fiction, Out of the Silent Planet (1938), C. S. Lewis presents an encounter between a trio of earthlings and the ratio- nal inhabitants of another planet. The fact that Malacandra (Mars) has three rational species, none with bodies identical to our own, gives rise to consid- erable confusion. The two villains, Devine and Weston, regard the most anthropomorphic Martian species - the sorns - as ignorant "primitives" or "brutes," and they shoot the seal-like hrossa as if they were mere beasts. The unwitting hero, Elwin Ransom, whom the villains have abducted in the mis- taken belief that the sorns are demanding a sacrificial victim, labors under a different set of illusions. Influenced by his reading of modern science fic- tion, Ransom initially envisions the aliens as monstrous bestial predators, and although these preconceptions are soon dispelled he continues to assume that one of the alien species must dominate (and may well feed upon) the other two. This misapprehension of other rational beings as savages, beasts, or ghastly monstrosities suggests that Lewis is concerned not only with future interplanetary travel, his ostensible motive for writing the novel, but also with existing conditions on our own planet. If nothing else, the peace and equality among the three Martian species, who live separately but never seek to sub- 523</page><page sequence="2">524 Sanford Schwartz ordinate one another, underscore the opposite situation here on earth - the propensity of a single rational species to split into factions that regard each other as inherently inferior to themselves or even as creatures of a different species. Why do we have such difficulty with honoring or even recognizing the rationality of the Other, and the equality it entails, when his or her rea- son is embodied in different shades of skin or in somewhat different forms of social practice? Would we regard one another differently, and treat the rest of the animal kingdom more compassionately, if rationality were distrib- uted among several species and we could behold "reason in an inhuman form" (65)?1 As we shall see, one of the functions of Lewis's fictional collision between terrestrial expectations and extraterrestrial reality is to challenge the evolu- tionary assumptions of nineteenth-century anthropology, which continue to distort our relations to one another and to the rest of the natural order. At the same time, Lewis's most remarkable invention - a planet that possesses three rational species - provides a corrective or "cosmic" rationality ("De Futilitate " 68) that explores the implications of extraterrestrial intelligence and sets the stage for further reflection on the order of terrestrial creation. At the literal level Lewis draws upon the age-old speculative tradition of the "plurality of worlds" to suggest that rationality is not merely a "biological" phenomenon unique to our own species but rather a "spiritual" endowment that transcends its embodiment in any single species. At another level the openly imperial ambitions of Devine and Weston, compounded by their failure to acknowledge the rationality of the Malacandrians, recall the long and violent history of Western imperialism and the presumption of ratio- nal superiority that has colored Western relations to other peoples of the earth. Furthermore, since two of the alien rational species resemble non- human animals on our own planet, the novel also raises issues concerning our problematic relations to the beasts: the persistent confusion and moral quandaries over animal sentience, cognition, and consciousness; the (mis)use of the traditional distinction between rational and nonrational beings to rationalize our indifference and cruelty to other species; and, in light of our presumptive status as the one rational species on the planet, the tendency to lose sight of the fact that we ourselves are embodied creatures inescap- ably bound to the animal kingdom. Thus the reader of the novel must keep in mind several distinct but related and often intersecting spheres of refer- ence. Lewis tells the story of first contact between ourselves and other ra- tional species, but woven into this cosmic drama is the distressing record of contact with members of our own species and the other creatures with whom we share the earth. Lewis's exploration of our troubled reckonings with human, animal, and extraterrestrial Otherness is at once a meditation on the perennial problems</page><page sequence="3">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 525 of our fallen state and a critique of the naturalistic orientation of modern thought, particularly in the wake of the Darwinian revolution.2 Unfortunate- ly, the prevailing emphasis on the theological dimensions of the novel has led readers to ignore Lewis's portrayal of the political and social crisis of his own times. In the actions of his two villains, Lewis presents not only a time- less satire on human corruption but also an exposé of European imperial- ism and the ideological apparatus employed to legitimate it. Moreover, as Devine and Weston tout their own racial supremacy and openly pursue the domination, displacement, or elimination of presumably inferior peoples, it becomes increasingly clear that Lewis is linking the violent legacy of tra- ditional imperialism to the new ideology of militant racism, especially viru- lent after the Nazi rise to power, which would soon lead to global warfare on an unprecedented scale and a genocidal campaign of unimaginable savage- ry. In a similar manner Lewis uses his benign but timorous hero not only to satirize the naturalistic nightmares of H. G. Wells but also to address the fears of his contemporaries as international tensions mounted and the prospect of war seemed ever more certain. It is therefore no accident that the events of this novel take place on the planet most closely associated with martial virtue. Ransom's progressive reorientation from the terrifying Wellsian il- lusions of his terrestrial perspective to the recognition of the beneficent char- acter of the universe beyond his own "silent planet" will go hand in hand with the restoration of his courage. In this respect Lewis's attempt to reawaken his readers to the presence of a rationally ordered and divinely governed creation - the "discarded image" obscured by the modern naturalistic world view - is closely tied to his immediate efforts to speak to the drastic condi- tions of his time and prepare a frightened people for the inevitable struggle ahead. I In an introductory note to his novel, Lewis apologizes for "certain slight- ing references" to Wells's science fiction and proceeds to honor his most in- fluential predecessor. Lewis makes no secret of his dependence on Wells, and scholars are well aware of his debt to seminal works such as The Time Ma- chine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The War of the Worlds (1898), and especially The First Men in the Moon ( 1 90 1 ) , upon which he drew extensively for the plot, characters, and incidental details of his novel. Nev- ertheless, as a result of these "slighting references," which play a significant role in the novel, it is not surprising that most readers regard Wells primari- ly as a foil for Lewis's own assault on evolutionary naturalism and his reas- sertion of a Christian world view. Regrettably, this tendency to emphasize points of contrast between the two authors obscures some of the most sig-</page><page sequence="4">526 Sanford Schwartz nificant affiliations between them. Lewis may reject the naturalistic assump- tions of "Wellsianity," but in his use of alien encounter to explore our prob- lematic relations to each other and to nonhuman animals, he is a resource- ful disciple of his literary master.3 In one of his most compelling works of science fiction, The War of the Worlds , Wells describes the invasion of earth by predatory superintelligent Martians with "minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish" (52). His narrator, an educated Englishman, sympathetically records the plight of his people, but at the same time he dispassionately sit- uates the extraterrestrial invasion in the naturalistic context of the terrestri- al "struggle for existence," coolly reminding his readers that to the Martians we are "at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us." From this vantage point the Martians are treating us no differently from the way we have treated other inhabitants of our own planet: And before we judge of them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior racesģ The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of ex- istence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit? (55) In the very process of asking us to suspend moral judgment upon the Mar- tians (who seem to possess no ethical faculty in any case), the narrator frowns upon the actions of our own species. Moreover, while directing attention to our cold-hearted brutality toward other members of our own kind, the narrator's reference to the "human likeness" of the Tasmanians exposes the way we rationalize our aggression by relegating the Other to less than hu- man status. By his own account Wells regarded The War of the Worlds as an attempt to unsettle the modern West from complacency and self-deceptive pride in its own ascendancy. After all, the aliens have targeted the most powerful nation on earth and easily brush aside its most sophisticated weaponry. If in the end the seemingly irresistible Martians are themselves swept away by simple bacteria, the unlikely defeat of a mighty invader by humble microbes (appearing soon after the rout of a well equipped Italian army at the hands of Ethiopian tribesman) serves as a cautionary tale to the imperial powers that currently rule the earth. In this sense The War of the Worlds , like Heart of Darkness and other turn-of-the-century fiction, displays a certain uneas- iness over the very success of Western civilization. The novel registers the diffuse but widespread undercurrent of anxiety over Western technological superiority - its apparent "empire over matter" (52) - and its present hege-</page><page sequence="5">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 527 mony over the other peoples of the planet. The imaginary Martian invasion of imperial England seems to express the fear of recompense in kind for the violence and indifference at the heart of our domination of the globe.4 Similar issues attend Lewis's most immediate source, The First Men in the Moon , which depicts the lunar expedition of two earthlings - the business- man Bedford and the scientist Cavor - and their discovery of the vast sub- terranean kingdom of the Selenites. This novel, like The War of the Worlds , seems to focus more on our fears rather than our hostility toward the un- known Other, especially after the rather hapless terrestrial intruders are de- tected and pursued by the aliens. Nevertheless, the problem of human ag- gression is never far from the surface: the bankrupt Bedford repeatedly com- forts himself with dreams of colonial exploitation of the Selenites, and in his climactic meeting with the "Grand Lunar" of this physically variable but instinctually unified species, Cavor makes the fatal mistake of describing the fractiousness of our own species, our propensity to turn against other mem- bers of our own kind, and the threat we pose to other species. In this respect Bedford and Cavor, who are the direct ancestors of Devine and Weston, ex- hibit by turns the fear and aggression that accompany the imperial adven- ture. Lewis at once simplifies and complicates Wells's scenario by reducing the businessman-scientist duo to ruthless predators, while vesting their more humane attributes, and their fears of the unknown Other, in his hero Ran- som. In his portrait of an alien world that "so closely resembled the unat- tained ideals of that far-divided species Man" (74), Lewis also attempts to turn the tables on Wells by suggesting that the latter's evolutionary naturalism, which places conflict between species at the center of the "struggle for exist- ence," may be symptomatic of the very fears and suspicions he wishes to overcome. In addition, Lewis's critique of what might be called "biocentric" thinking - the collapse of the "spiritual" into the "biological" realm, the re- duction of rationality to a purely naturalistic phenomenon, and the concom- itant elevation of "blood" and "race" to the highest value - introduces a new and historically ominous dimension to the social issues that Wells is address- ing. Nevertheless, as significant as these differences may be, Lewis appro- priated not only the external trappings but much of the substance of Wells's fiction. Like his predecessor Lewis relates interplanetary conflict to the trou- bled conditions of life on our own planet, and, though he occupies a differ- ent point on the modern political spectrum, he is equally critical of the mil- itant nationalism, imperialism, and racism against which Wells struggled for much of his long career. Perhaps a somewhat more sympathetic assessment of Wells's contribution would enable us to see that in his own novel Lewis was not so much dismissing as interrogating and reopening the modern problem of the origin and development of the species.</page><page sequence="6">528 Sanford Schwartz II The relatively simple linear plot of Out of the Silent Planet belies the com- plexity of its themes, which proceed from the mismatch between terrestrial expectations and the realities of the alien world.5 In the opening section (chapters 1-2) Elwin Ransom, a Cambridge philologist on a walking tour of the countryside, is approached by a cottager concerned that her son Harry, "being a little simple" (9), has not returned home. We soon learn that the boy works for Devine and Weston, who are planning to exploit and conquer the red planet - the former out of sheer greed, the latter out of a distorted view of human destiny. Devine and Weston have already been to Mars and met the soms , whom they regard as savage tribesmen, and as a result of this misapprehension believe that the aliens are demanding a terrestrial victim as a sacrifice to their gods. After Ransom's intrusion foils their plans to use the "feebleminded" Harry, Devine and Weston decide to sacrifice Ransom himself, and under the guise of hospitality they ensnare him with the help of a loaded drink.6 As a prisoner on their spaceship (chapters 3-6), Ransom discovers the reason for his captivity, and his initial anxieties approach the level of uncontrollable terror as images of cannibalistic savagery combine with Wellsian fantasies of ravenous arthropod monstrosities. Hence the vil- lains and the hero travel to Mars with different but related misconceptions of its inhabitants. The arrogant imperial dreams of the entrepreneur and scientist seem remote from the nightmarish literary illusions of their victim; taken together, however, these misapprehensions not only encompass the various domains of the modern imaginary - practical, intellectual, and aes- thetic, respectively - but also elicit the immemorial complex of fear and ag- gression that haunts our relations to the unknown Other. Devine and Weston offer a satirical portrait of Western imperialism and its ideological supports. With their pith helmets and khakis they are the fic- tional heirs to the boundless imperial ambition expressed by Cecil Rhodes in his famous assertion, "I would annex the planets if I could." The cynical Devine, a veteran of the "public school" system that operated as a training ground for future servants of the Empire, makes no pretense about his mo- tives. Well aware of the self-serving ambition that underlies the high-minded ideal of colonial service, he quickly informs us that his approach to the "na- tive question" on Mars will not be complicated by "the white man s burden" (30) or similar notions that conceal (and occasionally constrain) the real aims of imperial conquest back on earth.7 Weston, by comparison, is a more com- plicated case. Although his ruthless evolutionary ethics makes him equally prepared to exploit or exterminate the aliens, the eminent physicist is im- pelled by a seemingly impersonal ideal of human progress and regards his venture into space as the next step forward in the development of the spe-</page><page sequence="7">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 529 cies. In letters that describe the genesis of the novel Lewis associates "Wes- tonism" with the "dream of interplanetary colonization" and "the realisation that thousands of people, in one form or another, depend upon some hope of perpetuating and improving the human species for the whole meaning of the universe - that a Scientific' hope of defeating death is a real rival to Christianity" ( Letters 321; see also Letters 368, Green and Hooper 186). As Lewis indicates in other writings of the period, however, the "Westonism" that appears in the scientific speculations of J. B. S. Haldane or the novels of Olaf Stapledon should be conceived as the most recent fruit of a more fundamen- tal change that had been taking place over the course of several centuries - the transposition of the principal locus of Being from a transcendent God to an immanent power that realizes itself in the dynamic development of Man. As it took shape in the early nineteenth century, the new paradigm of '"Evolution' or 'Development' or 'Emergence'" ("Funeral" 83) may have found sublime expression in G. W. F. Hegel and Romantics such as John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, but as the century wore on and it became further entangled with European capitalism and overseas expansion, this momen- tous turn in Western thought began to assume a darker form. The appear- ance of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) gave further impe- tus to this process by accelerating the tendency, already well under way pri- or to Darwin, to think of differences within the human species in terms of a ladder of ascent from the "primitive" to the most "civilized." As it filtered back into social thought, Darwinian theory seemed to provide a biological ratio- nale not only for an unregulated capitalism that encouraged "survival of the fittest" at home but also for the political, economic, and social domination of "undeveloped" peoples abroad.8 Weston's cosmic imperialism expresses all these elements of the nine- teenth-century developmental paradigm - or "Wellsianity," as Lewis some- times called it ("Is Theology Poetry?" 79) - and adds a few more recent touches as well. Devine regards young Harry as little more than a "savage" and bribes him with alcohol to keep him pacified. Weston shares the view that Harry is more like a "preparation" than a "human," but he takes the cru- cial step beyond the evolutionary anthropology of the imperial era into the insidious ideologies of the twentieth century: "'Incapable of serving human- ity and only too likely to propagate idiocy. He was the sort of boy who in a civilized community would be automatically handed over to a state labora- tory for experimental purposes'" (19). It is tempting to associate Weston's remark with his later, more blatantly transparent assertions of the suprem- acy of his "race" and its right to interplanetary Lebensraum ( 1 35-40) . How- ever, if it is uncertain whether Lewis at this time was aware of the emerging atrocities of Nazi "racial hygiene," we should remember that for several de- cades prior to Hitler's accession to power in 1933 the so-called "science" of</page><page sequence="8">530 Sanford Schwartz eugenics was promoted vigorously by many intellectuals, conservatives and progressives dike, not only in Great Britain, where it first appeared, but also in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world. Indeed, Weston's reference to the propagation of "idiocy" recalls the one legislative success of the British eugenics movement, the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913, which limited the rights of the so-called "feebleminded" by permitting (under cer- tain conditions) their detainment and segregation from the rest of the pop- ulation. Thus the modern developmental paradigm, which underwrote the "guns and gospel" imperialism of the late nineteenth century, finds its ful- fillment in the noxious mix of racism and eugenics that sanctions, in the name of progress, the most savage treatment of those we have deemed less human than ourselves.9 Ill If Devine and Weston embody an imperial contempt for the Other, Ran- som carries within him the fears, and the underlying sense of insecurity and vulnerability, that fuel the impulse to exercise control over other beings. One of the most prominent aspects of the novel is its concern with the debilitat- ing effects of fear and the courage required to contain it. Throughout his voyage in space (chapters 3-6), Ransom is besieged by a multitude of terrors that threaten to overwhelm him. Sometimes his emotions are tied to spe- cific objects; at other times "he did not even know what he was afraid of: the fear itself possessed his whole mind, a formless, infinite misgiving" (25). After he lands on Mars, Ransom's discovery and subsequent flight from the dread- ed soms (chapters 7-9) brings him close to the point of panic and raises the specter of madness and suicide. In his struggle to retain possession of his faculties, the hero begins to understand how fear has distorted his percep- tion and dimmed his reason. However, even as he adjusts to his unfamiliar surroundings and realizes that most of his apprehensions have been un- founded, his fearful imagination resurfaces with each successive phase of his adventure. Many of Ransom's terrors are tied to fantasies of extraterrestrial life in- spired by his reading of modern science fiction: He had read his H. G. Wells and others. His universe was peopled with hor- rors such as ancient and mediaeval mythology could hardly rival. No insect- like, vermiculate or crustacean Abominable, no twitching feelings, rasping wings, slimy coils, curling tentacles, no monstrous union of superhuman intelligence and insatiable cruelty seemed to him anything but likely on an alien world. [. . .] He saw in imagination various incompatible monstrosi- ties - bulbous eyes, grinning jaws, horns, stings, mandibles. Loathing of in- sects, loathing of snakes, loathing of things that squashed and squelched, all</page><page sequence="9">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 531 played their horrible symphonies over his nerves. But the reality would be worse: it would be an extra-terrestrial Otherness - something one had nev- er thought of, never could have thought of. (35) It is significant that these extraterrestrial nightmares are based on the fear and loathing of certain types of creatures on our own planet. Whereas De- vine and Weston express the hubris that reflects our increasing control over the rest of creation, Ransom elicits the ancient and enduring fear of living things that are proximate and ubiquitous but alien and threatening to our very existence. Paradoxically, this fear may be intensified, as it is in Wells's portrait of alien invasion, by a naturalistic worldview that conceives the re- lations between the species in terms of a ceaseless "struggle for existence." Whatever its origin and historical mutations, however, this estrangement between man and other creatures reflects an elemental insecurity that ac- counts for our propensity to transform the animal Other into a terrifying monstrosity, and consequently for the self-serving habit of rationalizing the often brutal excesses of our dominion over the "irrational" beasts. Thus, when our imagination is given free rein to envision an encounter with ex- traterrestrial life, it is no surprise that we conjure up bestial figures that ex- press the ineradicable fears that continue to disturb our ever expanding he- gemony over the rest of creation. Ransom's fears are also tied to the social and political situation of the thirties. Just as Weston's actions point beyond traditional imperialism to fascist racism, Ransom's ordeal extends beyond its direct reference to Well- sian fantasy to the pervasive fear and confusion of his contemporaries over the growing threat of Nazi aggression in the second half of the decade: Al- though this element of the novel seems to have escaped the attention of its contemporary reviewers, the opposition between a humane but frightened protagonist and a ruthlessly aggressive enemy - a common scenario in the literature of the thirties - could not be more pronounced.10 The narrator reminds us that Ransom has seen action in World War I, and, as with many of his generation, the terrible experience of the trenches has left him unsure of his courage and horrified by the prospect of another war: The bellicose mood was a very rare one with Ransom. Like many men of his own age, he rather underestimated than overestimated his own courage; the gap between boyhood's dreams and his actual experience of the War had been startling, and his subsequent view of his own unheroic qualities had perhaps swung too far in the opposite direction. (37) Over the course of the novel Lewis not only probes the mind of his appre- hensive hero but also begins to provide him with the resources, at once phys- ical and spiritual, to overcome the crippling effects of fear. It is worth not-</page><page sequence="10">532 Sanford Schwartz ing that Lewis's own participation in the Great War left him physically im- paired and haunted by memories and nightmares related to the horrors he had witnessed at the front. As frightful as the war had been, however, Lewis was opposed to the widespread pacifist movement of the thirties, and despite private attestations of his dread of another war, he joined the debate over pacifism and publicly defended the traditional concept of the "just war."11 There are no explicit references to the pacifist debate in Out of the Silent Plan- et, but in the progress of his hero Lewis addresses the collective trauma of his own generation and attempts to instill, as he later put it in a discussion of Mars in Gustav Hoists The Planets , "the good element in the martial spirit, the discipline and freedom from anxiety" ( Letters 381). Such are the virtues that will be required to face the impending terrestrial ordeal. IV In order to face the real enemy, Ransom must first confront the illusory ones that deform his understanding and consume him with fright. His sav- ing grace is that his fear of the Other is offset by the good will and open- mindedness that gradually transform his thoughts, perceptions, and feelings. The process begins on the trip to Mars as he sheds his Wellsian terror of outer space and finds himself "drawn by an irresistible attraction" (31) to the ce- lestial beauty around him: A nightmare, long engendered in the modern mind by the mythology that follows in the wake of science, was falling off him. He had read of "Space": at the back of his thinking for years had lurked the dismal fancy of the black, cold vacuity, the utter deadness, which was supposed to separate the worlds. [. . .] He had thought it barren: he saw now that it was the womb of worlds, whose blazing and innumerable offspring looked down nightly even upon the earth with so many eyes - and here, with how many more! No: Space was the wrong name. Older thinkers had been wiser when they named it simply the heavens - the heavens which declared the glory [...]. (32) In this celebrated passage Lewis launches his critique of Wells and his (re)turn from the modern conception of "Space" as mere extension to an earlier vi- sion of a resplendent universe infused with the presence of its divine cre- ator. We should remember, however, that this revelatory moment does not lead to the instant transformation of the hero. Moreover, the seemingly clear- cut alternative between modern desolation and premodern glory obscures the author's recognition of the enduring element of anxiety and doubt that attends our earthbound contemplation of the heavens. Lewis underscores the latter point in an essay that praises Wells for his rendering of Bedford's chilling encounter with "the infinite and final Night of space" ("On Stories"</page><page sequence="11">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 533 33). Bedford's dread of the cosmic void may reflect some questionable mod- ern assumptions about the universe, but, like "the silence of the eternal spac- es" ( Miracles 72) that terrified the devout Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century, his state of mind on the lunar surface elicits a primitive stratum of fear that links the mystery and vastness of the universe to the ineradicable insecurities of terrestrial life. In his portrait of Ransom, Lewis acknowledg- es this intractable element of fear in the human heart, but he also endows his hero with a receptivity to "otherness" ("On Stories" 35) that mitigates the terror of infinite space and suggests that our fears are at least in part a func- tion of our own troubled imaginations. At the same time, Ransom's brief glimpse of the heavens initiates the progressive change in perspective that slowly transforms our planet from the imperial center to the barbaric periph- ery of the cosmos, while simultaneously turning the extraterrestrial Other from an object of suspicion into a welcome rational copresence in a benefi- cently ordered universe.12 Not long after he lands on Malacandra, Ransom catches sight of the soms and, tearing loose from Devine and Weston, flees into the Martian forests. For days he struggles with fears that threaten to consume him, but he also finds some comfort in the beauty of the Martian landscape and sustenance in its edible plants. The decisive turn in his fortunes occurs when he sees a large seal-like creature and discovers that it is speaking to him. Lewis lin- gers over the crucial moment of recognition as "two so far-divided species stared each into the other's face": Ransom rose to his knees. The creature leaped back, watching him intently, and they became motionless again. Then it came a pace nearer, and Ransom jumped up and retreated, but not far; curiosity held him. He summoned up his courage and advanced, holding out his hand; the beast misunderstood the gesture. It backed into the shallows of the lake and he could see the muscles tightened under its sleek pelt, ready for sudden movement. But there it stopped; it, too, was in the grip of curiosity. Neither dared let the other ap- proach, yet each repeatedly felt the impulse to do so himself, and yielded to it. It was foolish, frightening, ecstatic and unbearable all in one moment. It was more than curiosity. It was like a courtship - like the meeting of the first man and the first woman in the world; it was like something beyond that; so natural is the contact of sexes, so limited the strangeness, so shallow the ret- icence, so mild the repugnance to be overcome, compared with the first tin- gling intercourse of two different, but rational, species. (55-56) The meeting between two different rational species has no terrestrial coun- terpart, but the comparison to the courtship between the sexes, reminiscent of the meeting of Adam and Eve in Paradise Lost, elicits the complex of de- sire and mutual recognition that sometimes outweighs the suspicions that</page><page sequence="12">534 Sanford Schwartz distance us from those we perceive as different from ourselves. At the min- imum, the ambivalence of this encounter - the "thrill of mingled attraction and repulsion" (56) - suggests that no instinct confines us to an exclusive attachment to our own kind and that our relations to strangers are not en- tirely at the mercy of our fears. More optimistically, the tension between curiosity and suspicion indicates that we are often inspired by the "shy, in- eluctable fascination of unlike for unlike" (59) as we look for signs of reci- procity that enable us to set aside the insecurities that breed enmity and vi- olence. Implicit in the fictional encounter between human and hrossa is a vision of social harmony that transcends the divisions between peoples as well as the barrier between species.13 If the Miltonie image of "the meeting of the first man and the first woman" is not entirely adequate to this vision, as the narrator himself maintains, the chapter's final vision of verbal com- munication between the species, "as though Paradise had never been lost and earliest dreams were true" (58), suggests that we are never entirely reconciled either to the cultural alienation that separates us from other persons or to the biological gap that has established a seemingly insuperable limit to rela- tions between the species. What ensues from this crucial encounter is a progressive transformation of Ransoms perspective. The change is signaled topographically by the dis- covery that he is not on the surface of the planet and surrounded by high mountains but rather in a deep canyon looking upward toward the uninhab- ited surface. This spatial reorientation prepares the way for the more mo- mentous change that takes place as he becomes further acquainted with the hrossa (chapters 10-13). As an observer steeped in nineteenth-century de- velopmental assumptions, Ransom initially identifies hrossan culture as "old stone age" (65), despite the poetic sophistication of its populace and other evidence to the contrary. In accord with his residual sense of Western supe- riority, he responds to questions about his origins by offering "a childish ver- sion of the truth in order to adapt it to the supposed ignorance of his audi- ence" (67). 14 Ransom soon discovers, however, that the hrossa know a great deal more than he supposes, and when it comes to spiritual matters "he found himself being treated as if he were the savage and being given a first sketch of civilized religion" (68). These centrally situated chapters, which recall Gulliver's life among the Houyhnhnms, constitute the Swiftean core of the novel. Here Ransom has the opportunity to observe a community of Un- fällen rational beings whose temperament and manners "so closely resem- bled the unattained ideals of that far-divided species Man whose instincts were so deplorably different." Realizing that "it was not they, but his own species, that were the puzzle" (74), he continues to shift away from the an- thropocentric orientation of our own species toward a recognition of the rational intelligence (cf. Jonathan Swift's "universal reason") that transcends</page><page sequence="13">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 535 the narrow and self-aggrandizing perspective of a single fallen species.15 At this point, however, Ransom still has a long way to go. On the basis of ter- restrial experience, he finds it difficult to believe that the three rational spe- cies coexist in a condition of equality and persists in the assumption that one must dominate the others. His failure to grasp that the three species, referred to collectively as hnau , submit to the common rule of a higher being is un- derscored by his recurrent inability to detect the presence of the angelic el- dila , who are immediately evident to the hrossa and their children. Ransom s perception will continue to sharpen, but before he departs from the hrossa and ascends to higher reaches of awareness, he will clear away another ob- stacle to his transformation by testing his uncertain courage in an adventure that turns risk and danger into the very spice of life. Somewhat surprisingly, Ransom's life among the peaceful hrossa con- cludes with a violent episode that pits man against beast - the hunt for an ancient sea-creature, the hnakra (chapter 13). 16 The hrossa conceive their relationship to the hnakra in terms that resemble a totemie kinship. They long to hunt and kill the hnakra as it longs to kill them, but the rational spe- cies regards the sea-beast not only as "our enemy" but also as "our beloved": We feel in our hearts his joy as he looks down from the mountain of water in the north where he was born; we leap with him when he jumps the falls; and when winter comes, and the lake smokes higher than our heads, it is with his eyes that we see it and know that his roaming time is come. We hang images of him in houses, and the sign of all the hrossa is a hnakra. In him the spirit of the valley lives; and our young play at being hnéraki as soon as they can splash in the shallows [...]. I do not think the forest would be so bright, nor the water so warm, nor love so sweet, if there were no danger in the lakes. (75) The hrossa , like the other rational species, have no fear of death, but the mortal danger associated with the pursuit of the hnakra seems to heighten the joys of life on this side of the grave. In this instance we are asked to con- sider a form of violence between man and beast that issues not from fear or indifference but from a primordial bond that transcends the division between rational and irrational animals and manifests their mutual respect and com- mon destiny as finite beings. Ransom shares the hrossa' s excitement at the prospect of the hunt. Despite his fears and the ominous warning of an eldil , he joins the expedition and delights in "his new-found manhood" (80) when he proves equal to the challenge. As it turns out, the victory over the hnakra comes at a heavy price. While Ransom and his hrossan comrades have been hunting the hnakra , Devine and Weston have been hunting for Ransom him- self. Spotting him on the shore just after he slays the hnakra , Ransom's pur- suers shoot and kill his hrossan friend (who in their eyes appears a violent beast and hence a threat to Ransom, who must be kept alive for sacrifice to</page><page sequence="14">536 Sanford Schwartz the sorns ). In the aftermath of this sequence, Ransom sees that his own ex- uberance, which prompted him to ignore the eldiFs command to refrain from the hunt, has led to the death of his closest companion, and in sorrow he heeds the angelic summons to proceed to Oyarsa. It is difficult to sort out the various strands of the hunting scene and its seemingly conflicting implications. On one side we might emphasize that Ransom is explicitly barred from participation in the hunt and that his de- fiance (or rather disregard amounting to defiance) brings death to someone he has come to love. Other aspects of the hunt, however, suggest that we should not infer from its unhappy outcome that it is always wrong to par- take in such activities. It is significant that on Mars an Unfällen rational spe- cies engages in a form of violence that cannot be dismissed as the conse- quence of an unnatural rupture of creation's original order. Translated into terrestrial terms, the relationship between hrossa and hnakra elicits memo- ries (or fantasies) of an ancient kinship between man and beast that acknow- ledges our common animal ancestry and a shared instinct for mutual chal- lenge. Whether or not this state reflects a lapse from a primordial condition that precedes the institution of violence between the species, the bond be- tween rational and irrational creatures on Mars suggests an intimacy between human and nonhuman animals that has been eroded by the increasing tech- nical power of the former and its ever growing domination of the latter.17 The loss entailed in this shifting balance of power maybe as momentous for homo sapiens as it is for the rest of the animal kingdom. The ritual of the hunt, which plays a prominent role in medieval and Renaissance literature, is as- sociated not only with a life-enhancing kinship between man and beast (a viewpoint that may not be shared by our prey) but also with the cultivation of martial skills that would be perilous to abandon in a world that sometimes requires the virtues of St. George.18 In this respect the hunting expedition serves as the means through which Lewis's hero restores his sense of physi- cal well-being and dispels the doubts about his courage. Although his in- volvement in the hunt is sufficiently problematic to suggest that we should remain wary of the passions excited by this form of violence, Ransom's new self-confidence prepares the way for the final stages of his Martian adven- ture and steels him for the conflict that awaits his return to earth. V After his departure from the hrossa&gt; Ransom once more finds himself alone in the Martian woods. In the symmetrical structure of the novel, the hero's solitary journey to the sorns (chapters 14-16) echoes the account of his earlier flight through the forest (chapters 7-9) but with a significant dif- ference. While he remains frightened of the sorns , Ransom is now march-</page><page sequence="15">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 537 ing toward the object of fear and possesses the requisite "confidence in him- self and in the world" (86) to accomplish his mission. Moreover, as soon as he reaches his destination, Ransom realizes that his fears have been misdi- rected. The sorns are far less gregarious than the hrossa , but they are no more belligerent, and as the most contemplative of the three rational species they enhance Ransom's knowledge of the physical, social, and spiritual conditions of their planet. Furthermore, by focusing on the fact that earth has only a single rational species, the sorns begin to explore the implications of the dif- ferences between their world and our own. As a satire on the human condi- tion, Out of the Silent Planet might have succeeded reasonably well if Mars contained merely a single Unfällen rational species possessing either human form or, like Swift's Houyhnhnms, the form of another terrestrial species. As we shall see, the presence of three rational species, each resembling a partic- ular kind of animal life on our own planet, not only adds a significant new dimension to the traditional Utopian formula but also constitutes the spec- ulative center of the novel.19 During his stay with the hrossa , Ransom's efforts to fathom the relations between separate rational species focus exclusively on the issue of domina- tion. The basis for his thinking is the terrestrial "struggle for existence," re- inforced by his "imaginative training" in Wells's science fiction: Were the hrossa [. . .] the dominant species on Malacandra, and the sorns , despite their more man-like shape, merely a semi-intelligent kind of cattle? [. . .] On the other hand, the hrossa might be the domestic animals of the sorns, in which case the latter would be superintelligent. His whole imagi- native training somehow encouraged him to associate superhuman intelli- gence with monstrosity of form and ruthlessness of will. (59) Although the hrossa inform him that all three species submit to the lordship of the supernatural Oyarsa, Ransom continues to search for "the real mas- ter" (69) among them. He supposes that the hrossa may be deceived and "were after all under the thumb of the sorns , superior to their masters in all the qualities that human beings value, but intellectually inferior to them and dependent on them" (86). From a terrestrial perspective such conjectures are quite reasonable. Like the relations between Eloi and Morlocks in Wells's The Time Machine , they are a plausible extrapolation of common assump- tions about the evolutionary process and the perpetual struggle for mastery that characterizes relations within our own species. Even as his other illu- sions begin to evaporate, Ransom's preconceptions about the Martian or- der of species are so entrenched that they survive his dawning recognition that the ruthless conditions of our own planet are a singular aberration from the universal norm. In this way Lewis prepares us for Ransom's experience</page><page sequence="16">538 Sanford Schwartz with the sornsy which lays to rest any lingering doubts about the equality of the three Martian species and establishes a new perspective on the sorrows of our own species. The significance of this new perspective becomes apparent during Ran- som's conversations with his reflective Martian hosts. The latter are partic- ularly intrigued by the fact that the earth has only a single rational species, a condition that "must have far-reaching effects in the narrowing of sympa- thies and even of thought." As one of the company describes it, '"Your thought must be at the mercy of your blood [...,] for you cannot compare it with thought that floats on a different blood"' (103). The narrator does not relate the rest of this discussion, leaving us to ponder its crucial if at first misleading implications. Initially it sounds as if our terrestrial woes proceed from an accident of circumstance or, worse yet, from a flaw in the original design of creation. Few if any readers, however, are likely to conclude that Lewis is attributing our tendency to behave like spoiled children to a prior act of divine miscalculation. A more likely interpretation is that Lewis is calling upon the long-standing tradition of the "plurality of worlds" in or- der to challenge the modern biocentric tendency to confuse the spiritual and organic realms by reducing the former to a function of the latter.20 As em- bodied creatures our "thought" is never dissociated from our "blood," but unless we recognize that rationality is part of the spiritual endowment through which we participate in an order that transcends the natural, we will continue to employ our distinctive gifts in a way that betrays their original purpose and deforms our relations to each other and to the rest of the nat- ural order. The soms have little acquaintance with terrestrial conditions, but their observation that our "thought" must be at the mercy of our "blood" also elicits the atmosphere of distrust and hostility that pervades relations with- in our own species, especially at a moment when "blood" had become the very basis for the "the narrowing of sympathies and even of thought." Once again, the problem is not a structural deficiency in the natural order but the process of false "speciation" through which a fallen creature denies its essen- tial unity with others of its own type. If this seemingly ineradicable impulse is somehow related to the absence of other species with whom to share a condition of equality, there is still very little in our history to suggest that we would treat other rational species any better than we treat other members of our own species. In this sense the harmonious relations of the several kinds of Martians, who are far more different in appearance than we are to one another, bears painful witness to the ceaseless strife and divisiveness within our own kind. This unhappy situation has been intensified rather than alleviated by the modern reduction of rationality to a naturalistic and exclusively anthropomorphic function. By denying that our rationality is</page><page sequence="17">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 539 related to an order of being that transcends our own species, we blind our- selves to that element of our nature through which we transcend our differ- ences, and as a result of this shift from "spiritual" to "biological" kinship ("Religion and Rocketry" 91) we end up turning minor variations into es- sential distinctions based on impassable differences of "blood." The primary effect of Ransom's conversation with the soms is to reestab- lish a conception of rationality that transcends its distinctive embodiment in the human species or in any single subset of the species. Paradoxically, the acknowledgment of a universal community of reason that is not limited to our own kind also involves the admission of our own animal nature and therefore of our kinship with the nonrational beasts. It is no accident that Ransom first identifies himself to the soms with the words (ironically rem- iniscent of René Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum"), "ťThe animal I am is called Man'" (92).21 The encounter with "reason in an inhuman form" (65) height- ens Ransom's awareness of his own body as it appears in the eyes of a ratio- nal creature with a very different body. The narrator later returns to this issue when his protagonist attends a gathering of the three species and is startled by its level of mirth and humor, as if "the comic spirit arose chiefly from the meeting of the different kinds of hnau" (117). He analyzes this phenome- non in the concluding "Postscript": Each of them is to the others both what a man is to us and what an animal is to us. They can talk to each other, they can cooperate, they have the same ethics; to that extent a sorti and a hross meet like two men. But then each finds the other different, funny, attractive as an animal is attractive. Some instinct starved in us, which we try to soothe by treating irrational creatures almost as if they were rational, is really satisfied in Malacandra. They don't need pets. (156) Readers are sometimes troubled by this passage, which suggests either a flaw in the design of terrestrial creation (the absence of other rational species, which produces a misplaced affection for the beasts) or, from a point of view different from Ransom's own, an anomalous moral lapse on the part of the Malacandrians (the lack of feeling for nonrational animals that we express in our fondness for pets). In light of Ransom's encounter with other ratio- nal species, however, it requires only a minor adjustment of perspective to read these lines not as a wish to reinforce the already troublesome estrange- ment between rational and nonrational creatures but as a recognition of our own animal status and its significance for our relations to other living things, human as well as nonhuman. As Ransom describes it, the instinct satisfied in Malacandra is akin to our amusement in observing certain differences in gesture, dress, and custom in our visits to unfamiliar places. The pleasure derives from the simultaneous recognition of identity and difference - the</page><page sequence="18">540 Sanford Schwartz identity that involves the awareness of others as centers of consciousness like ourselves, which prevents us from reducing them to a mere objects, and the difference that marks them as embodied creatures with features, habits, and proclivities somewhat dissimilar to our own. Perhaps if we are as self-aware as Ransom when he introduces himself to the soms as "the animal [. . .] called Man," it may dawn on us that we appear as odd and amusing to others as they seem to us. When we see with the eyes of the Other, we are conscious of ourselves not simply as subjects but also as objects, as centers of experi- ence who are also creatures with bodies. As for our relations to the beasts, the admission that we are animal as well as rational offsets the gnostic ten- dency of our species (intensified in modern thought by the Cartesian disso- ciation between spirit and matter, mind and body) to view ourselves prima- rily as knowing subjects who stand apart from the rest of creation. In this respect the recognition that we are embodied creatures who remain inescap- ably bound to the animal kingdom takes us a step closer to reclaiming the deeper kinship expressed in our love of pets, our fantasies of talking beasts, or our remembrances (real or imagined) of a primordial intimacy with spe- cies other than our own.22 VI The various elements of the novel come together in the climactic episode (chapters 17-20) on the island sanctuary of Meldilorn. Here Ransom com- pletes the process of transformation that began on board the spaceship with his first glimpse of the "heavens." When he arrives on the island, Ransom examines a series of sculptured stone monoliths that finally reveal to him that Malacandra is the planet Mars. He also meets the last of the rational spe- cies, the pfifltriggi , and for the first time he can see "as much as he ever would see" (109) the supernatural eldila for whom "light is instead of blood" (1 19). This opening sequence culminates in his long-anticipated appearance before the planets supreme eldil , the Oyarsa of Malacandra. From the Martian ruler he learns of the ancient conflict between their two planets - the story of the rebellion of the once magnificent Oyarsa of Thulcandra (Earth); the latterà attempt to extend his rule to Malacandra, which damaged the surface of the planet and forced its inhabitants to live beneath it; the failure of his invasion and the retreat to his own world, where "he lies to this hour, and we know no more of that planet: it is silent" (121). Ransom's encounter with Oyarsa raises once again the persistent prob- lem of fear. The hero has been gaining in self-confidence ever since the hunt- ing expedition, but as he approaches Meldilorn his apprehension increases, and Oyarsa's opening line, "'What are you so afraid of, Ransom of Thul- candra?'" (119), launches a new phase in the novel's exploration of the blind-</page><page sequence="19">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 541 ing effects of fear. Since we have shared Ransom's point of view from the outset, we sense his surprise upon learning that his presence on Malacandra is not the result of a chance encounter. The plot strains credibility at this point, but in the final and most sudden shift in his orientation Ransom dis- covers that Oyarsa has summoned him to Malacandra (via Devine and Weston) and that the eldila have been protecting him throughout his jour- ney: "You began to be afraid of me before you set foot in my world. And you have spent all your time then in flying from me. My servants saw your fear when you were in your ship in heaven. They saw that your own kind treated you ill, though they could not understand their speech. Then to deliver you out of the hands of those two I stirred up a hnakra to try if you would come to me of your own will [...]. After that I sent my eldil to fetch you, but still you would not come. And in the end your own kind have chased you to me [. . (120) Attributing Ransom's unresponsiveness to his fears, Oyarsa learns that De- vine and Weston never apprised their captive of the real origin of his adven- ture. Whether or not Oyarsa's judgment of Ransom is circumscribed by his limited acquaintance with the ways of fallen creatures, his focus on martial virtue is not misplaced. As we soon discover, the supreme eldil possesses a profound understanding of the efficacy of fear and sees that its dominion extends beyond the terror-prone Ransom to his ostensibly bold and aggres- sive enemies. Ransom's appearance before Oyarsa is interrupted by the arrival of De- vine and Weston, who have been captured and escorted to Meldilorn with the bodies of the hrossa they have slain. Somewhat disconcertingly, the two villains remain obstinate and seemingly fearless even in captivity. In con- trast to Ransom, Devine and Weston "clearly thought that they had good reason to fear, though neither was by any means lacking in courage" (126). Still regarding Oyarsa as little more than a savage chieftain, Weston adopts the condescending stance of the colonial adventurer, employing "the most orthodox rules for frightening and then conciliating primitive races" (128). His efforts to intimidate the natives - "Poufifi Bang!" (127) - or to seduce them with trinkets - "Pretty, pretty! See! See!" (128) - seem ridiculous in this context, and they meet with resounding laughter on the part of the Malacandrian assembly. The comic spirit of this moment concludes with Oyarsa's pronouncement, "Something is wrong in your head, hnau from Thulcandra. There is too much blood in it" ( 1 30) , followed by the command to submerge the physicist's head in cold water. If at one level we can smile at this sequence, Oyarsa's reference to "blood" also has a less literal meaning and more somber implications, which come to the fore after Weston returns</page><page sequence="20">542 Sanford Schwartz from the treatment that has presumably brought him to his senses. In his last appearance before Oyarsa, Weston's old-fashioned colonialism modulates into a cosmic version of modern racism that echoes the most militant forms of fascism. As he braces himself for the final confrontation, Weston remains as undaunted as ever, "a brave man suffering in a great cause, and rather eager than reluctant to face the worst or even to provoke it" (133). In his truculent manner the scientist asserts the supremacy of his "race" and sets forth the iron law of evolutionary ethics - "the right of the higher over the lower" (135) - that justifies the elimination of lesser forms of existence if they impede the relentless development of "Life," which is "greater than any system of morality" and ruthlessly crushes the "obstacles" and "failures" that stand in the way of its progress. As the self-appointed emissary of the high- est form of life, Weston leaves no doubt about his willingness to sacrifice himself (and anyone else) to the advancement of his species as it "presses forward to that interplanetary leap which will, perhaps, place her [Life] for ever beyond the reach of death" (136). As it appears in the text, Weston's bombastic address is cleverly broken into a series of discrete sections so that Ransom can "translate" each one in turn. Ostensibly designed to cross the barrier between languages, Ransom's "translation" presents Weston's ideo- logy in terms that unmask its shameless self-aggrandizement and render it at once shocking and virtually beyond comprehension to rational beings unacquainted with (or repulsed by) the misuse of reason to sanction naked aggression.23 Oyarsa acknowledges Weston's bravery as well as the selfless devotion with which he pursues his irrational cause. With Augustinián insight he sees that the physicist's obsession, like that of his less selfless counterparts back on earth, is a perversion of the natural "love of kindred" (138), which has been elevated into an object of idolatry and pursued to the exclusion of all other virtues. At the same time the Martian ruler exposes the essential element of fear that lies at the heart of Weston's crusade. According to Oyarsa, it was fear that clouded Weston's comprehension of their initial meeting: "'When you first came here, I sent for you, meaning you nothing but honour. The darkness in your own mind filled you with fear. Because you thought I meant evil to you, you went as a beast goes against a beast of some other kind, and snared this Ransom. You would give him up to the evil you feared'" (134). Oyarsa goes on to attribute Weston's fixation on the perpetuation of his "race" to the inescapable fear of death that plagues our species. In response to Weston's declaration that the goal of his cosmic imperialism is to "make man live all the time," Oyarsa begins to ponder the terror that once came close to overwhelming his own planet. During the ancient war with his terrestrial counterpart, Oyarsa witnessed the trauma of his own hnau , who were in danger of becoming "as your people are now - wise enough to see the death</page><page sequence="21">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 543 of their kind approaching but not wise enough to endure it" (139). In their retreat from the surface of the planet, however, the stoic Malacandrians also left behind their fears, "and with fear, murder and rebellion. The weakest of my people does not fear death. It is the Bent One, the lord of your world, who wastes your lives and befouls them with flying from what you know will overtake you in the end. If you were subjects of Maleldil you would have peace" (140). Weston and his kind are admittedly brave and prepared for self-sacrifice, but their courage, which has been pressed into service of ends that turn martial virtue into a monstrous vice, is ultimately an expression of the very fear and insecurity it is designed to overcome. After announcing his decision to send Devine and Weston back to Earth, Oyarsa turns his attention to Ransom, who is granted the choice of remain- ing on Mars or returning to his own planet with the two villains. Given his recently acquired distaste for his own species, it is significant that Ransom appeals to the same virtue that motivates Weston's fanatical racism - "love of our own kind" - and decides to return home. In his parting speech Oyarsa returns once more to the problem of fear with which their acquaintance began: "ťYou are guilty of no evil, Ransom of Thulcandra, except a little fearfulness.'" Reminding Ransom that Devine and Weston "ťmay yet do much evil"' (142), Oyarsa admonishes him to maintain vigilance and exer- cise his new-found courage to stand up to their aggression. While racial vi- olence has been successfully checked on Malancandra, it will require not only fortitude but also confidence in the ultimate triumph of Maleldil to sustain our resolve and defeat the powers that threaten our own world. Thus, while Ransom survives the trial of the return voyage and savors once again the familiar sensations of his native planet, there is a something of a sting to the bracing "pint of bitter" (151) that greets his arrival home. VII After the launching of Sputnik in 1957, Lewis returned to the issue of extraterrestrial intelligence that he had begun exploring in his science fic- tion of the thirties.24 Unlike the earlier accounts in his letters, which focus primarily on the conflict between naturalistic and religious world views, the post-Sputnik essays are far more explicit in establishing the connections between our hypothetical encounters with rational aliens and our troubled relations to one another and to nonhuman animals on our own planet. Considering the previous record of our species, Lewis is relieved to know that on the basis of current evidence we are unlikely to meet another rational species any time soon: This thought is welcome to me because, to be frank, I have no pleasure in</page><page sequence="22">544 Sanford Schwartz looking forward to a meeting between humanity and any alien rational spe- cies. I observe how the white man has hitherto treated the black, and how, even among civilized men, the stronger have treated the weaker. If we en- counter in the depth of space a race, however innocent and amiable, which is technologically weaker than ourselves, I do not doubt that the same revolt- ing story will be repeated. We shall enslave, deceive, exploit or exterminate; at the very least we shall corrupt it with our vices and infect it with our dis- eases [...]. We are not yet fit to visit other worlds. We have filled our own with massacre, torture, syphilis, famine, dust bowls and with all that is hid- eous to ear or eye. Must we go to infect new realms? ("The Seeing Eye" 173) In retrospect Lewis claims that it was reflections of this sort that first moti- vated him to reverse the tendency of his literary predecessors, who "almost automatically represented the inhabitants of other worlds as monsters and the terrestrial invaders as good" ("The Seeing Eye" 173). As in the letters of the thirties and forties, Lewis still identifies the impulse behind this cosmic imperialism with the modern "'scientific' hope of defeating death," but in situating "Westonism" within the context of the colonialism, racism, and global exploitation with which it has been entangled for the last two centu- ries, he now comes closer to articulating the more complex network of rela- tions between extraterrestrial, human, and animal Others implicit in the novel he completed more than two decades before. In these later pieces Lewis also directs more attention to the failures of "recognition" ("The Seeing Eye" 172) that afflict not only his villains but also his well-intentioned hero. As we have seen, Ransom's perceptions of the unknown Other are not instantly transformed by his initial cosmic recog- nition that replaces Wells's naturalistic conception of "Space" with the spir- itual conception of the "Heavens." In fact, it takes Ransom most of the nov- el to overcome his misconceptions of the aliens and the fear and suspicion that provoke them. For a fallen species that often fails to acknowledge other members of its own type, the question of whether a particular species of extraterrestrial animal possesses a "rational soul" might not be so easy to decide. In one instance we may be foolish enough to misidentify some clev- er talking creatures who are "from the theological point of view, really only animals, capable of pursuing or enjoying only natural ends" ("Religion and Rocketry" 85). In another instance we may fail to discern our essential kin- ship with beings who are "genuinely spiritual, whose powers of manufacture and abstract thought were so humble that we should mistake them for mere animals. God shield them from us!" ("Religion and Rocketry" 86). "Much depends on the seeing eye," Lewis tells us, and since our detecting apparatus has proven so vulnerable to our capacity for self-deception, we have little reason to think that we will fare any better in our interplanetary exploits than we have in our dealings with other creatures on our own planet.</page><page sequence="23">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 545 In the spirit of the epigraph from Rousseau's Second Discourse with which this essay begins, Ransom's confusion over the nature of extraterrestrial spe- cies compels us to ponder the enigma of our own species. Rousseau, who stood at the crossroads between traditional and modern world views, chal- lenged Enlightenment pretensions to knowledge of human nature by exam- ining the prevailing (and often contradictory) assumptions about human- kind in the so-called original "state of nature" from a proto-anthropologi- cal perspective. Anticipating the modern problem of "recognition," Rous- seau exposes the ethnocentric prejudices that led explorers and missionar- ies of his own day to relegate various "species of anthropomorphic animals" (207) to subhuman status.25 Revealing how even philosophers are prone to attribute to human nature the accidental accretions of their own particular culture, Rousseau's analysis of the conceptual confusions over our own es- sential attributes goes so far as to lead him to speculate whether rationality itself, at least in its present constitution, should be regarded as an original and therefore defining characteristic of our species. Lewis, who saw himself poised at another crossroads at the far end of the Enlightenment epoch, engages in a similar search for knowledge of humankind by journeying to "another dimension" ("On Stories" 35) where the problem of identifying the nature of the alien leads to perplexity over the origins of our own self-di- vided species - "What was the history of Man? (74) - and hence to crucial questions about human nature itself. Lewis like Rousseau challenges the prevailing view of human origins and development among the philosophers and scientists of his own era. How- ever, as a witness to what he considered the disastrous results of the natu- ralistic reduction of reason in the modern centuries, Lewis departs from Rousseau's hypothetical reconstruction of the "state of nature" by attempt- ing to restore the concept of the "rational soul" as an original spiritual en- dowment that has been corrupted by its own misuse. In this respect he fol- lows the lead of another speculative history of human nature, G. K. Ches- terton's The Everlasting Man (1925), which calls into question the modern image of "primitive" man and the ensuing narrative of human evolution as it appears in Wells's The Outline of History: Being a Plain History of Life and Mankind (1920). In a manner akin to Rousseau's critique of European eth- nocentrism, Chesterton demonstrates that the same "primitive" arts and artifacts that modern scientists associate with subrational humanity might well have been produced by creatures with minds as rational as our own. Like Chesterton, who suggests that we reexamine the modern account of the ori- gins and progress of our species from the sobering vantage point of another planet, Lewis demonstrates the need for a new and less self-centered "cos- mic" or "corrective" anthropology, which is at once wary of our own provin- cial rationality, cognizant of our aptitude for misrecognition of the Other,</page><page sequence="24">546 Sanford Schwartz and confident of the power of transcendent Reason, which "corrects human imperfections of Reason" ("De Futilitate " 68), to restore us to our senses. Pennsylvania State University NOTES his late post-Sputnik essays on extraterrestrial intelligence, Lewis explains that the shared "rationality" with which he is concerned is "not merely the faculty to abstract and calculate, but the apprehension of values, the power to mean by 'good' something more than 'good for me' or even 'good for my species.' If instead of ask- ing, 'Have they rational souls?' you prefer to ask, 'Are they spiritual animals?' I think we shall both mean pretty much the same [...]. It is spiritual, not biological, kin- ship that counts" ("Religion and Rocketry" 85; see also "The Seeing Eye" and "Un- real Estates"). In these later writings Lewis bases his vision of a prospective encounter with rational aliens on the troubled history of relations within our own species: "They [our ambassadors to new worlds] will do as their kind has always done. What that will be if they meet things weaker than themselves, the black man and the red man can tell [...]. Against them we shall, if we can, commit all the crimes we have already committed against creatures certainly human but differing from us in fea- tures and pigmentation" ("Religion and Rocketry" 89-90). Moreover, here on earth the perpetual internecine strife within our own species cannot be separated from our relations to other species, since we readily justify our crimes against other hu- man beings by relegating them to the status of beasts. With respect to the latter, Lewis retains the traditional criteria of rationality and speech to distinguish human and nonhuman animals, but he holds out the possibility that other animal may possess a "rational soul" and would therefore have the same right to "equality" that we of- ten deny to our fellow human beings ("The Seeing Eye" 174). In general, Lewis's anthropocentrism is tempered by his respect for the sanctity and perhaps the final redemption of every living thing, his recognition of the limits and responsibilities associated with divinely appointed stewardship, and his realization that, if "spiritu- al animals" are distinguished by their capacity to acknowledge something beyond "natural ends" ("Religion and Rocketry" 85), they are also the only animals with a demonstrated history of pursuing ends that violate and corrupt the natural order. In the conclusion of this essay we will return to Lewis's later reflections on interplan- etary travel, which place more emphasis on the relations between extraterrestrial, human, and animal intelligences than his more commonly cited letters of the thir- ties and forties. 2Lewis predates the ubiquitous use of "the Other" in recent multiculturalist dis- course, but his own use of the term proceeds from the same post-Hegelian tradi- tion that lies behind its widespread deployment in contemporary philosophy, liter- ature, and social science. Ever alert to our tendency to reduce, embellish, or other- wise distort objects of perception to suit our own purposes, Lewis uses "other" and</page><page sequence="25">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 547 "otherness" as substantives primarily (1) to call attention to the distinctive and sin- gular reality of another person (e.g., "H. rushes upon my mind in her full reality, her otherness" [A Grief Observed 65]); (2) to describe a domain or imaginary "world" that stands apart from and is irreducible to the contours of our everyday world; or (3) in the manner of Rudolf Otto's modern reassertion of the Divine as "wholly Other" (25), to refer to the separateness, transcendence, and unfathomable mystery of God. 3On Lewis's relationship to Wells, see among others Filmer, Lake, Myers (1994), and Peters. Myers provides a detailed account of the extensive structural similari- ties between Out of the Silent Planet and The First Men on the Moon. Also helpful are overviews of the Space Trilogy by Downing and Sammons, as well as Stableforďs comprehensive study of the British tradition of "scientific romance." Wells's later novel, Men Like Gods (1923), which projects an unruly cohort of modern English- men into a future Utopian world, also bears comparison to Out of the Silent Planet, particularly in Wells's account of the conflict between the haughty imperialism of the English and the civilized life of our rational descendants, who contain the ag- gression of the intruders and dispatch them back to their own savage century. 4See Brantlinger and Wilt on the anxiety over the long-term consequences of imperial dominion as it appears in the fiction of Wells, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, and other popular turn-of-the-century writers. 5The linear plot also obscures the precise structural symmetries of the novel, which is divided into twenty-two chapters plus a postscript with no indication of any grouping of the chapters into larger units. My division of the first six chapters into two sections - the first on earth (1-2), the second on the spaceship (3-6) - pre- supposes a formal design that becomes increasingly apparent in the second half of the novel (see note 16). 6In these opening chapters Lewis employs the ancient themes of hospitality to strangers and sacrificial violence to undermine Western pretensions to superiority over so-called "primitive" peoples. In the deceitful semblance of hospitality toward Ransom, Lewis ties modern violence to archaic practices that speak to our age-old suspicions and hostility toward the outsider. With respect to sacrifice, Lewis relates modern rationalizations for discarding other living beings in the name of progress to the seemingly primordial need for rituals of violence to contain what appears to be the ever-present threat from powers beyond our control. (Indeed, Weston will later acknowledge that his aim, which may require the sacrifice of any "lower forms of life" [137] that impede its realization, is to gain control of the very conditions of existence - to "make man live all the time" [ 1 39] by overcoming death itself.) In their misguided belief that the Martians are demanding a sacrificial victim, Devine and Weston are at once projecting onto the aliens the barbarity within themselves and engaging in the very forms of violence they attribute to the primitive Other. Fur- thermore, the chain of sacrificial substitutions - from the dog whom they have al- ready sacrificed to scientific experiment, to the allegedly subhuman child, and finally to one's own acknowledged peer - exhibits not only the reversion to human sacri- fice but also the process through which the distinction between inviolate and dis- posable beings reveals its increasingly treacherous character. 7By the 1 930s the high tide of "gun and gospel" imperialism had long since passed.</page><page sequence="26">548 Sanford Schwartz However, if imperial ideology was on the defensive, the vast British Empire was still intact, and many of the older assumptions and attitudes survived well into the mid- twentieth century. A distinguished array of interwar authors, including Forster, Orwell, Waugh, and Greene, precedes Lewis in attacking the heritage and enduring realities of Empire. In a later recollection of his early experience in an English pub- lic school, Lewis maintains that "I hated whatever I knew or imagined of the British Empire" ( Surprised by Joy 173). Although he came from a prosperous line of Ulster Anglicans and spent much of his life in Oxford, Lewis continued to regard himself as Irish rather than English and shared the enduring Celtic resentment of the Sax- on oppressor. 8In a number of essays Lewis conceives of Darwinian theory as an effect rather than cause of the "Myth" of evolutionism: "The clearest and finest poetical expres- sions of the Myth come before the Origin of Species was published (1859) and long before it had established itself as scientific orthodoxy." At the same time he claims that, irrespective of its affiliations to earlier expressions of the Myth, the theory of biological evolution should be taken seriously and tested as a "genuine scientific hypothesis" ("Funeral" 83). His most extensive account of this position appears in "Is Theology Poetry?" See Stocking (1987) on the formation of evolutionary anthro- pology (which also precedes the appearance of Darwin's work) and its complex re- lations to imperial ideology in the second half of the nineteenth century. If Lewis respects evolutionary biology as a "genuine scientific hypothesis," he dismisses the evolutionary assumptions of nineteenth-century anthropology as a misguided ex- trapolation symptomatic of the ultimately pernicious tendencies of the "Myth" of development. See Stocking's follow-up study (1995) on the breakdown of the evo- lutionary paradigm and the transformation of British anthropology in the twenties and thirties. To a certain extent the situation of the three species on Malacandra mirrors the new anthropological paradigm (which has itself come under fire in re- cent years) with its respect for the integrity and coherence of each of the distinctive cultures that constitute the family of humankind. 9As established by Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, the new science of eugenics held out the promise of systematic improvement of the species through conscious management of the reproductive process. The history of the eugenics movement has been well documented in recent years (see Kevles and Barkan, among others, and Jones on the British movement in particular). In the United States twenty-four states passed legislation permitting involuntary sterilization of the mentally retarded. By the time the practice became discredited in the 1940s, more than 35,000 people had been sterilized. It is significant that the debate over eugenics at first cut across the usual ideological divisions, with advocates and adversaries on either side of the po- litical spectrum. The movement was perpetually tainted by charges of class snob- bery and racism, but prior to the 1930s, when eugenics became ever more closely associated with Nazi excesses (see Proctor and Burleigh), progressives such as Hal- dane (see his Daedalus [1924]) often promoted their own ambitious programs for biological engineering. Among the earliest and most outspoken opponents of eu- genics were Catholics such as G. K. Chesterton, whose Eugenics and Other Evils (1922) is often considered the first sustained critique of the movement. In the diary he kept during the twenties, Lewis refers to the popular topic of eugenics on several occa-</page><page sequence="27">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 549 sions, and his entry for 13 June 1926 indicates that he was reading Chesterton's book ( All My Road 214; see also 149, 153, 163, 401, 412). Lewis does not abandon the problem of eugenics after the opening incident of Out of the Silent Planet. As a major component of twentieth-century "Westonism," it remains a significant undercurrent of the first two novels in the Space Trilogy and returns as a primary issue in That Hideous Strength (1945). For some of the more prominent contemporaneous cri- tiques of racism in the thirties, see Voegelin, Huxley and Haddon, and Barzun. 10Hynes traces the conflict between uneasy protagonists and powerful aggressors in the major poets of the thirties, including W. H. Auden, C. Day Lewis, Louis Mac- Neice, and a large supporting cast. Many of the longer poems and plays involve sym- bolic journeys beyond the familiar frontiers of an enervated society, and the typical protagonist of these poems, like Ransom, is preoccupied with his own fears and the discipline required to master them. An especially interesting case is Audens play The Ascent ofF6 (1937), whose hero - an introspective scholar named Ransom! - is drawn into the dangerous world of imperial rivalry when he is asked to lead an ex- pedition up an unsealed peak on the border between two colonies controlled by ri- val powers. Hynes identifies a similar pattern in the proliferation of travel books that exhibit the characteristic thirties concern with courage and heroic action in unfa- miliar, threatening, or openly violent conditions. See Cunningham for a more re- cent and comprehensive overview that touches upon many of these issues, Schweizer on travel writing in the thirties, and Hughes on the strikingly similar focus on her- oism in French writers of this period. nSee "The Conditions for a Just War" (325), originally a letter in response to E. L. MascalTs "The Christian and the Next War" ( 1939). Lewis's most fully developed statement on pacifism, "Why I Am Not a Pacifist," is a posthumously published ad- dress apparently delivered to an Oxford pacifist society in 1940. Other references to pacifism are scattered throughout his writings of the period. 12One of the detrimental effects of this momentary vision of the heavens is that it tends to project the reader (especially one familiar with Lewis and his works) too far ahead of Ransom. To the extent that we regard Ransom's subsequent misprisions on Malacandra merely as residual effects of his initial Wellsian illusions, we lose sight of the striking accuracy of his perceptions and the cogency of his often erroneous conjectures, conditioned as they are by his own terrestrial experience. By ignoring the ineluctable temporality of the process of Ransom's reorientation, we also miss the insights generated along the way by the tension between his slowly altering per- spective and the realities of the new world he is gradually coming to understand. Time and again it is through Ransom's judicious misconceptions about the relations among the three rational species that Lewis explores the problematic divisions within our own species and the relations between our species and the rest of the animal kingdom. Consider, for instance, the moment when the mammalian hrossa first inform Ransom of the existence of other rational species, including the frog-like pfifltriggi. At one level Ransom's silent conjecture that "apparently, three distinct species had reached rationality" (69; my emphasis) reflects the limitations of the evolutionary perspective he has transported to Mars. At another level this inference prompts us to speculate on the origins and development of the species on our own planet, whether from the religious vantage point of a creation that has been ruptured</page><page sequence="28">550 Sanford Schwartz by human transgression or from a naturalistic perspective that permits us to imag- ine an evolutionary process that might have turned out otherwise. 13In Animals and Why They Matter , the philosopher Mary Midgley offers some intriguing thoughts on the tension between exclusivity and openness in human so- cieties. Despite our proclivity to constitute identity by exclusion of others, human communities are selectively permeable. Many societies are receptive to some degree of heterogeneity within them, and separate groups can dwell peacefully in the same locale, however limited and precarious these arrangements have proven to be. From an anthropological perspective it is also notable that our societies are selectively open to other species. We are not only willing to live in close proximity to certain beasts but also capable of identifying with their perspective and developing relations of mutual affection. Midgley has read Lewis's novel and commends him for reconcil- ing these opposing tendencies through his portrayal of rational species that live sep- arately among their own kind but respect the equality, and occasionally enjoy the company, of other rational species. From a more radical contemporary perspective that extols the migratory and hybrid, Lewis's vision may seem rather retrograde, but Midgley, who is no friend of sectarianism, recognizes and urges acceptance of the widespread desire to live among one's own. 14Ransom's pseudo-explanation that he had come out of the sky (67) also ech- oes the encounters between white adventurers and native tribesmen in Haggard's King Solomon's Mines (1885) and other imperial adventure fiction of the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. 15The anti-imperial subtext of Gulliver's last voyage comes to the fore in its final chapter when he contemplates the futility of any European attempt to colonize the seemingly vulnerable Houyhnhnms, hoping instead that the latter "were in a Capac- ity of Disposition to send a sufficient Number of their Inhabitants for civilizing Europe ; by teaching us the first Principles of Honour, Justice, Truth, Temperance, publick Spirit, Fortitude, Chastity, Friendship, Benevolence, and Fidelity." Lewis like Swift uses the encounter with other rational species for the double purpose of sati- rizing the condition of our own species and attacking Western presumptions to the right of dominion over "idolatrous and barbarous People" (Swift 278). 16The hunting scene also begins to reveal the distinctive symmetry of the book's twenty-two chapters, the same structure of a nucleus surrounded by a series of suc- cessive frames that Lewis would employ in Perelandra. The two-chapter account of the hrossa in the center of the novel (chapters 11-12) is preceded by the episode in which Ransom enters the boat that will bring him to the hrossa and is followed by the episode in which he joins the boating expedition that takes him from the hros- san settlement to the next stage of his travels. Taken together, chapters 10 and 13 frame the central chapters and, in turn, are framed by chapters 7-9 and 14-16, the first triad depicting Ransom's flight from the sorns after his arrival on Mars and the second recounting his journey to the sorns. These chapters are surrounded by an- other symmetrical set: chapters 3-6, which take place on the spaceship and depict Ransom's captivity and anticipatory fears of the aliens; and chapters 17-20, which are set in Meldilorn, the spiritual center of Malacandra, and present Devine and Weston in captivity while completing the process of Ransom's spiritual emancipa- tion. The opening section on earth (chapters 1-2) and the concluding section on</page><page sequence="29">Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet 551 the return to earth (chapters 21-22 plus the postscript) constitute the novel's outer frame. 17Lewis's representation of the primordial rapport and subsequent alienation between man and beast may be compared to the fascinating if in some ways very different account of animal sacrifice that appears in Bataille s Theory of Religion. 18See Thiébaux and Berry among others on the significance of the hunt, and the countercurrent of ethical reservations regarding it, in medieval and Renaissance lit- erature. 19Scholars have noted the correspondences between the three Martian species and the professions of the three earthlings on their planet. The contemplative sorws, poetic hrossciy and artisanal pfifltriggiy which represent in turn the intellectual, aes- thetic, and practical spheres, have their respective counterparts in the physicist Weston, the philologist Ransom, and the businessman Devine. In this distribution of functions, the aesthetic realm appears to occupy the middle ground between the intellectual and the practical. Ransom is an intellectual, but he is still most com- fortable with the sociable and poetic hrossa. For their part Weston and Devine are situated at opposite ends of the spectrum, the one representing the perversion of the intellect and the other the distortion of practical enterprise. Given these correspon- dences between earthlings and Martians, we should not forget that unlike the former, who are a single rational species distinguishable by function, the Martians are actu- ally three different species - corresponding roughly to humans, other mammals, and amphibians respectively - who are united by the common endowment of reason. To a considerable extent it is the tension between the functional similarities and the biological differences of the two planetary conditions that generates the speculative complexity of the novel. 20On the metaphysical and religious issues surrounding the surprisingly long history of the debate over the "plurality of worlds," see Crowe, Dick, and Guthke. In Out of the Silent Planet Lewis refers explicitly to the classical tradition of cosmic voyaging as it appears in Bernardus Silvestris s twelfth-century Cosmographia (153), but see Nicolson and Hillegas on Lewis's affiliations to the tradition of the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries. Wells begins The War of the Worlds with an epigraph from Johannes Kepler, whose Somnium , Sive Astronomia Lunaris (1634; see Lear) represents this new line of speculation on extraterrestrial intelligence, which includes some highly influential books by John Wilkins, Henry More, and, later in the cen- tury, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, Christian Huygens, and many others. An in- triguing early work by Immanuel Kant, Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (1755), attests to the survival of this tradition well into the eighteenth cen- tury. 21The title of one of Jacques Derrida's recent essays on the problematic bound- ary between humans and other animals - "L'Animal que donc je suis (à suivre)," which has appeared in translation as "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)" - also plays on Descartes' formulation. 22Lewis would return to the problem of modern gnosticism - and the double estrangement between mind and body, man and beast - in the final volume of the Space Trilogy, That Hideous Strength (1945), and his lifelong fascination with talk- ing beasts would come to full fruition a few years later in Chronicles ofNarnia ( 1950-</page><page sequence="30">552 Sanford Schwartz 56). Lewis's most refined discussion of animal suffering appears in the last chapter of The Problem of Pain (1939). See Laurent and Myers (1998) on this and other as- pects of his approach to animals and their plight in the modern world. From a con- temporary "posthuman" perspective, Lewis's criterion for distinguishing human from nonhuman animals - "the charm of speech and reason" (Out of the Silent Planet 58) - perpetuates the traditional anthropocentric claim to superiority over the other species. On recent developments relevant to literary study along these lines see Wolfe, who follows Derrida and other contemporary theorists in challenging not only tra- ditional views but also the residual anthropocentrism of the recent "animal rights" movement. 23"'It is in her right,' said Weston, 'the right, or, if you will, the might of Life her- self, that I am prepared without flinching to plant the flag of man on the soil of Malacandra: to march on, step by step, superseding, where necessary, the lower forms of life that we find [. ..]'"( 137). This speech Ransom translates as follows: "'He says [. . .] that because of this it would not be a bent action - or else, he says, it would be a possible action - for him to kill you all and bring us here. He says he would feel no pity. He is saying again that perhaps they would be able to keep moving from one world to another and wherever they came they would kill everyone [...]'"( 1 37) . Ransom struggles and usually manages to find a "rational" equivalent to Weston's declarations, but occasionally after several attempts he concedes that "I cannot say what he says" (136). 24The principal documents are two essays, "Religion and Rocketry" (1958) and "The Seeing Eye" ( 1963), and the 1962 roundtable discussion with Brian Aldiss and Kingsley Amis published posthumously as "Unreal Estates." 25See the remarkable discussion of the African "Pongos" in note "J" of the Sec- ond Discourse (203-13). In a detailed analysis of the accounts of seemingly dispas- sionate observers, Rousseau exposes the naive ethnocentrism of early modern an- thropologists by demonstrating that the very gestures and practices that Europeans regard as the actions of a nonhuman species might be readily explained as the be- havior of normal human agents. "For the three or four hundred years since the in- habitants of Europe have inundated the other parts of the world, and continually published new collections of voyages and reports, I am convinced that we know no other men except the Europeans [...]. One does not open a book of voyages with- out finding descriptions of characters and customs. But one is completely amazed to see that these people who have described so many things have said only what everyone already knew, that they have known how to perceive, at the other end of the world, only what it was up to them to notice without leaving their street; and that those true features that distinguish nations and strike eyes made to see have almost always escaped theirs" (210-11).
