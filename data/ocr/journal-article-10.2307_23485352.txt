<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yavne Raz Kletter and Irit Ziffer (Hebrew section pp. 60-62) During October-November 2002 a salvage excavation was conducted in an Iron Age II favissa in Yavne (map ref. 1263/ 1419). The excavation, on behalf of the Antiquities Authority, was directed by R. Kletter, with the assistance of R. Abu Khalaf (administration), T. Sagiv (photography) and E. Kamaisky (treatment of finds and packing) and all the Tel Aviv district archaeologists. The team of laborers, especially M. Levy, A. Nitchieva, P. Feldman, G. Gurevitz and I. Lisker contributed greatly to the excavation. Sincere appreciation is extended to all those who visited the excavation and offered encouragement and advice. The excavation was carried out on a hill located c. 200 m north of Tel Yavne, which undoubtedly identifies with Biblical Jabneh (Yavanel). Antiquities on the hill were first disturbed in the 1950s, when a temporary immigrant camp was established on the site. Various surveys undertaken at the site in consecutive years revealed fragments of figurines, chalices, and a fragment decorated with a bird from an incense burner, attesting to a cult site on the hill. A salvage excavation was undertaken at the site in 1978 prior to the construction of a public shelter {HA 65-66:42-43). The preparation of a public park further damaged the site in 2001; two boxes of ceramic finds were collected thereafter, including a fragment decorated with the legs of a human figure (Fig. 88). Digging a robbery pit into the site (0.5 x 1.0 m, depth 0.5 m) further demolished the site and a salvage excavation that would save it from total destruction was indispensable. A circular favissa (diam. c. 2 m, depth in excess of 1.5 m; Fig. 89), containing numerous ceramic finds from Iron Age II (c. 10th century BCE), was exposed. A bulldozer working at the site badly destroyed its upper part and the contents were dispersed throughout the area. The surface potsherds were all gathered and the process took two full days due to the immense quantity. The pit was carefully excavated, using dental instruments and hand picks, to avoid further harm to the vessels. The contents, transferred to the Antiquities Authority for future study and research, included the following finds: 1. About sixty ceramic crates that included mostly parts of cult stands (Fig. 90), several of which are complete or nearly so. Most of the stands are small and some are unique, having no exact comparisons. All the stands are fenestrated and have apertures, as well as applied and/or incised decoration, including button shaped knobs, coil and rope ornaments. Many stands are decorated with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures in a variety of combinations. Over 100 such figures were discovered in the pit. A few stands are decorated with floral motifs. Altogether, the fragments seem to belong to twenty or more stands that will undergo restoration. 2. An enormous quantity of various-sized fragments of curved chalices (incense burners), comprising a bowl and a pedestal. Most are wheel-made; many have burnt traces on the inside of the bowls and some are decorated with paint. 3. A large number of small and medium-sized bowls, mostly broken, which have been recovered from a thick ash layer (Fig. 91). Most of the bowls are curved and have a disk or delicate ring base; some bowls are burnished. 4. Other ceramic finds include imported Cypro Phoenician juglets and their local variants, black juglets, trefoil juglets, as well as several hollow zoomorphic figurines and a kernos. The favissa apparently belonged to a temple that was associated with the city of Yavne, which was probably located on the same hill. Temples and cult sites close to cities, outside of the built-up areas, are known from the Late Bronze Age (Tel Hazor, Tel Lachish) and Iron Age I (The "Bull" Site, Bethel, etc). The favissa assemblage is representative of Philistia's coastal culture and it certainly has no affiliation to the realm of the Kingdom of Judah. According to 2 Chronicles 26:6, which is considered a credible source, Yavne was probably included within the Philistine domain in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE and only in the 8th century BCE it was conquered by Judah. It is hoped that studying the favissa will contribute to our knowledge in several fields. Firstly, it will aid in understanding the phenomenon of favissae. These pits have not been carefully documented in the past; they are rarely detected because they are small, hardly visible from the surface and located outside 46*</page><page sequence="2">built-up areas. Secondly, the finds are invaluable for art history studies, since they include numerous figurative representations. Thirdly, it will augment our knowledge regarding Philistia and its residents at the beginning of Iron Age II, as the written sources are nearly nonexistent. The vessels in the favissa represent the site's occupants and may perhaps shed some light concerning their identity, religion and cult practices. Figure captions: 88. Yavne.
