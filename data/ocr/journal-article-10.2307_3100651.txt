<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eva Hesse London by ALEX POTTS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor GIVEN THE PRECARIOUS state of so many of Eva Hesse's works, it is to the considerable credit of Elisabeth Sussman and Renate Petzinger, the co-organisers of the major retrospective devoted to Hesse (I936- 70) held last year at the San Francisco Mu- seum of Modem Art and the Wiesbaden Museum and now at Tate Modern, London (closes 9th March), that they have managed to assemble such a comprehen- sive exhibition. Including as it does almost all Hesse's significant mature works, and a host of early paintings, drawing and reliefs, it provides a unique opportunity to gauge the full scope of her achievement. What is most striking about the show, however, is the fresh intensity of the works themselves, above all those produced in the last five years of Hesse's brief but astonishingly productive career. The art of the 1960s has lately been attracting a great deal of inter- est, but it would be hard to think of anoth- er artist active in that period whose work would still come over now with such vivid immediacy. The deft informality and in- ventiveness of her working procedures, and the quietly but pointedly irreverent intelligence of her conceptions, seem very much of the present.' This is true even though the materials she used have often seriously deteriorated, in some cases to the point where the works have literally fallen apart. The latex soon lost much of its rubbery elasticity and 127. One more than one, by Eva Hesse. 1967. Acrylic paint and papier-maich6 on wood and plastic with painted cord, on panel, 39 by 22 by 14 cm.

However, in most cases, this has not resulted in the work looking tired or worn-out, in marked contrast to the dowdy ageing common to much Pop art once the works have lost the lustre of newness. Even Claes Oldenburg's painted canvas creations of the mid-1960s can nowadays look a little past their prime. With Hesse, the changes that have taken place in the material fabric of the work and the muted transformations of colour and texture seem, usually, to register the pas- sage of time rather than a process of ageing. To a large degree the original freshness of conception has been left intact. Even so, there are moments where the material decay and the loss of suppleness and texture have reached a point where the work goes sadly dead, as with the latex-covered panels of Aught (1968) which just made the journey from the Berkeley Museum of Art to San Francisco, but were too far gone to be transported to the other venues. Encountering a significant body of Hesse's work at first hand tends to divest it of the weight of sombre and often agonis- ingly serious myth and over-interpretation that have accrued around it of late. This unburdening occurs partly because of her characteristic lightness of touch - both literal and metaphorical - that borders at times on insouciant irreverence. There is something ludicrously and wittily THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE ? CXLV ? MARCH 2003 237</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS simple, for example, about One more than one (Fig.127), in which two identical hemi- spherical hollows, each threaded with a painted cord that dangles down and falls on the floor, are placed directly side by side in a rectangular block suspended against the wall. This is not a wilfully bizarre wit, nor is it quite deadpan. Its distinctive flavour is nicely conveyed by the presentation of Hesse and her work in a fascinating film made by Dorothy Beskind in Hesse's New York studio in 1967, on show at the entrance to the exhibition in Tate Modern. At one point, Hesse takes hold of Accession II (no.I30), her famous minimalist gal- vanised steel box threaded with thousands of segments of plastic tubing, and gives it a gentle shake, demonstrating that the seem- ingly rigid, metal structure is actually a bit floppy, and then bends down and sticks her head inside it. This is not to deny, of course, the seri- ous ambitions and belief in the power of art that fuelled her project, and quite explicit- ly so, as is evident from the much quoted statement she prepared in 1969 when she exhibited Contingent (the one really major work, now in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, whose frail condition prevented it from being included in either this or the earlier, touring retrospective of 1992-93): I remember I wanted to get to non art, non connotive, Non anthropomorphic, non geometric, non, nothing, Everything, but of another kind, vision, sort. From a total other reference point . it's not the new. It is what is yet not known, thought, seen, touched but real- ly what is not. and that is The idea that a deeply felt commitment to radical artistic practice might transform a sense of the everyday world operates as more than a notional aspiration in Hesse's case. It is as if she had managed to reinvig- orate something of the utopian impulse of the earlier modern avant-garde, in a con- text where this could so easily seem old hat or compromised, or only credible when hedged by gestures of outright negation. A feeling akin to utopian uplift might describe the impact of seeing at first hand a representative array of her work. Going through the exhibition, it is hard not to feel exhilarated when passing from her earlier paintings and wall reliefs to the powerful, intensely strange three-dimen- sional works she produced in 1965-66 (Fig.I28); or finding oneself face to face with the further transformations effected by the astonishingly assured masterpieces of the late I960s, from Sans II and Repetition nineteen III (Fig.129) made in 1968 through to possibly the single most powerful and deeply intriguing work in the entire show, the Untitled rope piece (Fig.I30) dating from 1970, the year of her death. 129. Repetition nineteen III, by Eva Hesse. 1968. Fibreglass and polyester resin, 19 units, height of each 48 to 51 cm., diameter 28 to 32 cm. (Museum of Modem Art, New York; exh. Tate Modem, London). Such a dramatising of her career, how- ever, is a little misleading. While these late works have unusual scope and command- ing presence, the impact they make has a lot to do with the fascination exerted by the vividly evident processes of their fabri- cation. One quickly becomes engrossed in the variety and charged intensity of the hanging and pulling together and pulling apart of strings and ropes and the threading of pieces of tubing, or intrigued by the very slightly irregular yet smooth surfaces created by pouring liquid latex onto flat moulds and peeling it away, or by dipping sheets of cheesecloth into the liquid latex. There is also the variegated, somewhat liquid feel of the rigid forms created by pouring polyester resin over thin mats of fibreglass loosely crumpled into a mould. This all sounds like process art. But what emerges from the hanging, threading, pouring, peeling, layering, and hardening is not just traces and effects of process, but things - strange and sometimes even dis- turbing things, such as the split and crum- pled cylinders dumped together on the floor in Tori (1969), or simple, oddly digni- fied things, such as the nineteen irregular fibreglass buckets of Repetition nineteen III. And sometimes, too, unmanageable, ex- tremely puzzling things emerge, such as the Untitled rope piece, tangled, congealed in latex, unruly, yet also floating, suspended on taut wires attached to the ceiling, the clusters of knotted and dangling rope and string contrasting with the tightly stretched connecting cords that give internal support to this unwieldy creation. Sometimes it looks like an array of half-petrified creepers ripped out of a primeval forest, at others it seems almost purged of the dense material- ity of organic things to suggest a new, almost abstract form of life suspending itself in mid-air. Hesse often made the point that she was fascinated by the absurd, and her work clearly suggests that she was at home with ludicrous contradictions, with processes that cancel out one another, such as tying things up and taking them apart, and with nudging a stable and rigid order into 130.

There is for example a disconcerting interplay set up in Ennead (1966) between the geometric regularity of the grid on the rectangular panel set against the wall, and the accumulating chaos of the strings dangling out of it. There is another, more fundamental way, however, in which her works seem almost preposterous, that is how pretty well nothing - sheets of latex, cylinders or slightly rumpled surfaces of fibreglass - becomes something by way of a basic and casually structured process of fabrication - 'it is something, it is nothing', as Hesse said. The effect is summed up in the title of Aught, four picture-like things made out of pairs of latex-covered sheets of canvas pressed together at the edges and bulked out by the invisible materials stuffed inside, suspended in a row against the wall on grommets inserted at their top corners. The dictionary definition of aught is 'any- thing at all' or 'in any least part, to any degree'; but in its less common usage it also means 'nought'. Something added, something taken away. A nothing at all, perhaps, or a very ordinary thing, an 'anything whatever', for some inexplicable reason, takes on signi- ficance. Hesse's art sustains itself on this fine line between common nothingness and striking presence. This may seem modernist to a degree, and undoubtedly her rigorous way of working, her effacing of representational imagery, has a lot that is modernist about it. But that is only part of the story. Her work has an elusive charge that exists in excess of her modernist-seem- ing procedures - there is the biomorphic, almost surrealist evocativeness of the casu- ally variegated textures and surfaces she allows her abstract shapes to take on, the acutely intelligent wit that animates her conceptions and, above all, the strange intensity she achieves through her simple yet striking transformations of everyday shapes and substances. There is a very illuminating essay by Briony Fer, 'The Work of Salvage: Eva Hesse's Latex Works', on the complex resonances of Hesse's working procedures, in the finely illustrated and thoughtfully conceived exhibi- tion catalogue: Eva Hesse.
