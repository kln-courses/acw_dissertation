Her people walk our streets; her youth sit, peers and rivals of our students, in the class-room; her art adorns our homes, and has opened to us a new Gate Beautiful. The wise men from the West are, at this writing, opening their treasures of tea, silk, gold- lacquer, bronzes, and porcelain at the first centennial of our nation’s birth. We hail the brightness of the rising of this first among Asiatic nations to enter modern life, to win and hold a place among the foremost peoples of the earth.1 The symbolic meaning of the magi topos is clear enough: the pilgrims are wise to the extent that they pay tribute to a godly presence of which they are newly aware—that is, the Christianity Griffis and others were trying to bring to Japan and the more directly palpable power of U.S. commerce. Even as it echoes this biblical topos, Griffis’s metaphor evokes and revises those European philosophies of history according to which History has moved from east to west and, to be clear, from the East to the West: “I cherish the firm hope that Japan will in time take and hold her equal place among the foremost nations of the world, and that, in the onward march of civiliza- tion which follows the sun, the Sun-land may lead the nations of Asia that are now appearing in the theater of universal history” (578). What appears in Griffis’s opening as a slight rhetorical variation (Wise Men coming from the West) is, then, symptomatic of a U.S. reconfiguration of idealist ABSTRACT This essay analyzes the cultural meaning of the enormous popularity of, and signifi- cance attributed to, Japanese objects in the United States during the last quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury. By locating this significance at the intersection of the United States’ racial, economic, and mate- rial imaginaries, the essay argues for an interpretation of the Japanese object as an “ethnic thing” that suggests new ways of understanding of the relationship between objectification and racialization. / REPRESENTATIONS 99.

At the same time, the figure of Oriental gifts coming from the west is at least as literal as metaphorical: for most of the latter half of the nineteenth century, the comings and goings of people between Japan and the United States would be dwarfed by those of things.2 This link between world-historical change and gifts from that West formerly known as the East can also be found in, for example, Walt Whitman’s 1860 “A Broadway Pageant,” written on the occasion of the first Japanese embassy to the United States.3 Whitman writes of America’s new access to Japan: “The box-lid is but perceptibly open’d, nevertheless the perfume pours copiously out of the whole box.” Its poetic aroma aside, this perfumed box (frankincense?) hints at the commer- cial dimension of the new relationship, both in echoing the keyword used to describe Perry’s forcible introduction of U.S.–Japanese trade (“opening”), and in the image of the box itself, a synecdoche of all those lacquered boxes emblematic of the new trade with the Wise Men from the West.4 Whitman’s poem is a celebration of the symbolically charged ways in which the “opening” of Japan was to make the manifest destiny of the United States particularly manifest. His description of the embassy’s parade moving up Broadway quickly becomes a hymn to Libertad (in Spanish throughout) and its march through the world, a delirious account of the pa- rade’s allegorization and embodiment of the world-historical progress of Libertad, whose relationship to the expansion of trade and the rise of an im- perial United States is explicit: I chant the new empire grander than any before—As in a vision it comes to me; I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy, I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those groups of sea-islands, My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes, My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind, Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races reborn, refresh’d, Lives, works resumed—the object I know not—but the old, the Asiatic renew’d as it must be  Commencing from this day surrounded by the world. The coming decades would indeed see a dramatic expansion of U.S. mil- itary and commercial power in the Pacific, and Whitman’s poem is, among other things, a clear instance of the ways in which the Orient pro- vided, in Rob Wilson’s phrase, “a repository not just of cheap labor but of symbolic capital” to be used by U.S. authors “to idealize imperial Western designs.”5 The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 75 </page> <page sequence="3"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 76 Drawing, like Griffis, on a Romantic and at least indirectly Hegelian solar metaphorics of History, Whitman figures the arrival of the Japanese ambas- sadors as nothing less than the closing of Libertad’s circular path through the world: “The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,/The ring is circled, the journey is done.” The centuries are “justified,” “accomplished”: “They shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake Libertad.” Far more explic- itly than Griffis’s magi metaphor, Whitman’s vision reveals the extent to which the new Pacific frontier of the United States, specifically the access it gives to Japan, implies more than a quantitative extension of the earlier frontier be- yond its continental limits. This bridging of East and West is understood as nothing less than the reconnection of the forward, westward movement of his- tory with its origins in the East, signaling the simultaneous globalization and indeed end of history: henceforth not only will the whole of the globe be spa- tially interconnected but so too will all the world’s ages, future as well as past.6 Far from simply adding one more trading partner to a growing list, then, the coming of the Japanese ambassadors was understood to signal a qualitative shift in the character of the American project: the advent of its universality. While Griffis emphasizes the novelty of Japan’s entrance onto the stage of “the theater of world history,” Whitman emphasizes the extent to which this theater was to undergo renovation under new ownership. For if the United States was the key agent in causing Japan to be “henceforth sur- rounded by the world,” Japan, correspondingly, was helping the United States redefine itself as ultimately synonymous with the world. This total do- minion of time and space is not to be understood as a conquest. Whitman imagines an empire without imperialism, one in which Japan would play the exemplary role of being not a colony but a world-historical trading partner in a mutually beneficial global market produced by and productive of an in- creasingly global freedom. He writes not of some clash of civilizations, but of a mutual embrace: “These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me, and are seiz’d by me, / And I am seiz’d by them, and friendlily held by them.” In 1872 Ralph Waldo Emerson would similarly write that Japan had a sort of “claim on” the United States, because of “the singular se- lection it showed,” as he puts it, “in appealing to America for its guidance and assistance to win western civilization.”7 Noblesse oblige for Libertad. Drawing an implicit contrast to the ongoing destructive history of the Euro- American treatment of Native Americans, Emerson notes with pride that Commodore Perry brought with him to Japan not “beads and rum barrels” but “the best of our civilization”: locomotion, steamboats, telescopes, and telegraphs (16), in short, the technological means of connecting distant places—not merely the fruits of modernity but the seeds as well. What must have seemed to many the unforeseeable expansion of U.S. power into the Pacific is understood by Emerson as the fulfillment of a 76 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="4"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 77 charter inscribed at the earliest horizon of the nation’s origin. He asserts a forceful imaginative connection between Japan and the very “discovery” of the Americas. Marco Polo was, he writes, the first Westerner to have de- scribed seeing the Japanese islands and it was with “this book of Marco Polo in his hands” that Columbus, upon sighting Cuba, believed he too had reached those islands. “He had not come there,” Emerson concedes, “but he showed mankind the way from thence to Japan, and President Fillmore found it.” Commodore Perry’s 1852/54 “opening” of Japan is thus seen as a resumption of Columbus’s voyage—“only now are the threads gathered up of relation between the farthest East and the farthest West” (15–16)—an achievement that is both specific to the United States and universally human (it is “mankind” that is “showed . . . the way”). In sum, the traditional trope of East Asia as the antipodes of the West assumes a new meaning in the con- text of the U.S. “opening” of Japan: rather than figuring the opposite of the world-spirit, the prehistorical, the prehuman, this Orient becomes the fron- tier where the fullest progress of Spirit, the fullness of humanity, the now indisputable universality of U.S.–style Liberty at and as the end of history, reveals itself. Such strong reactions by both major and minor figures of American let- ters provide some sense of the extent to which Japan seemed to many of them to hold a special meaning for the destiny of their own nation. Studies of the late nineteenth and early-twentieth century commonly refer to a West- ern “fashion” or “trend” for all things Japanese: initially ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but then arts and crafts in general, religion and folklore, and eventu- ally literature.8 Collectively labeled japonisme—or, more openly pejorative, japonaiserie—this interest in Japan was a vast phenomenon, to be found in nearly all Western nations beginning some time in the third quarter of the nineteenth century and lasting until at least the turn of the century, but ar- guably well into high modernism and beyond. Japanophilia was one of the most widespread aesthetic and cultural facts of the second half of the nine- teenth century, but with few exceptions it has yet to be studied with the seri- ousness brought to bear on, for example, primitivism, to speak nothing of nineteenth-century Hellenism or medievalism.9 As the texts from Griffis, Whitman, and Emerson have already suggested, however, the writings of nineteenth-century Japan enthusiasts constitute a complex and perhaps sur- prisingly coherent discourse that touches on some of the basic themes and problems of globalization and modernity. Needless to say, the meanings of this transnational japonisme varied widely according to national context and historical moment. Here I wish to articulate a constellation of features essential to a specifically Ameri- can “japonisme” from the period of initial fascination and enthusiasm to the time when events both foreign and domestic would cause Japan to be The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 77 </page> <page sequence="5"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 78 increasingly seen as a threat—that is, during the roughly half century from the “opening” of Japan in 1852/54 to the first Japanese wars of aggression (the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the Russo-Japanese War in 1905), wars that coincided with the first substantial Japanese immigration to the United States.10 Far from merely provoking a fad or trend, I will argue, Japan played an important role in the ways in which many citizens of the United States imagined such weighty issues as nation, empire, and history. The U.S. fascination with Japan was not simply a superstructural ornament on the edifice of capitalist imperialism, I want to suggest, but testifies to a consid- erably more conflicted relationship in which it might be said that U.S. modernity was being imported from, as well as exported to, its “nearest Western neighbor.” The sources I have cited so far suggest the constellation of themes that helped define the imaginative and discursive landscape of America’s Japan during this period. First: the strong identification of the long-term national destiny of the United States with its new relationship to Japan. Second: the correlation of this identification with a philosophical-historical logic accord- ing to which, in spatial terms, the United States is to pursue its destiny not within its continental borders, but globally and, in temporal terms, to take the baton of world-historical progress back toward its point of origin and thereby unite the future and the past. Third: the centrality of traffic in things to the unfolding of this world-historical destiny. This third point may seem an incidental or merely empirical detail in re- lation to the broader historical points. This essay argues, however, that Japanese things not only provided part of the economic underpinnings for the lofty imaginings of a world-historical vision but also played an essential role in the articulation of that vision. Part commodity, part art object, part exotica, the Japanese thing participated in both the material culture of the Gilded Age’s everyday and that age’s grandest visions of universal history and liberty. I argue for a conceptual and historical connection between what might be called the subtle materiality of social, and specifically racial, form (the recalcitrant cultural logics that guide and constrain the thinking or ex- perience of social categories) and the more conventional materiality of things (in this case, specifically Japanese things: lacquered boxes, fans, and so on).11 It was not simply the case that Americans related to the glut of im- ported Japanese objects in ways symptomatic of a broader imaginary of Japaneseness; rather, I claim, the U.S. relationship to Japaneseness was deeply connected to its more general relationship to things. To be more pre- cise: the contradictory logic according to which the exchange of commodities was to achieve the fullness of humanity precipitated, in the Japanese thing, an unstable ontology in which the distinction between persons and things was necessarily uncertain. Correspondingly, it was in the ethnic particularity 78 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="6"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 79 of the specifically Japanese thing that the universality of the American pro- ject seemed most legible. The Japanese thing was not simply an example of the embodiment of a racial imaginary, but a site at which the logic of em- bodiment itself was worked through. Moreover, this problem of embodi- ment was not narrowly academic or philosophical, but an acutely lived prob- lem in a culture that was becoming, or seeking to become, at once more national and more universal, more imperial and more democratic, more consumerist and more folksy, more immigration-based and more distinctly American. In sum, I will argue for a reading of the Japanese thing as an eth- nic thing, an analysis of whose racialization (and, in a sense, deracialization) makes legible the relationship between the various spheres in which “Japan” charged the cultural imagination of the Gilded Age.12 “the universal currency of mind” Although some Japanese wares had found their way into the West previously, their impact was relatively limited until the 1860s, when Japan began producing substantial quantities of goods for export after opening to commerce with the West. Culture-brokers of the young Meiji government pioneered their techniques of self-marketing at the 1873 International Ex- position in Vienna and were perfecting them by the 1876 American Cen- tennial in Philadelphia, after which American collection and consumption of Japanese things began in earnest.13 The just under ten million visitors who attended the centennial over six months would have encountered, in addition to Japan’s 14,000 square feet in the main exhibition hall, a Japanese Bazaar, a Japanese Dwelling, and a main building with twenty-one acres of exhibition space in which to display 30,000 products worth around nine million dollars in today’s money.14 Ellen P. Conant notes that “by 1885 the United States had become by far the major market for Japanese ex- ports.”15 By the time of the Columbian Exposition in 1893, cultural interest and trade had increased so much that Japan sent about 1,750 tons of goods, roughly six times the amount they had sent to Philadelphia, and even this was a limited selection of what at one point was a planned 7,000 tons, a pair- ing down that was necessary for the goods to fit into the roughly 143,000 square feet of overall space Japan had been allotted.16 An anonymous re- porter writing on the exhibit reports that the Japanese displays included: Lacquer work; embroidery; yuzensome; cloisonné enamel; carving in wood, iron, bronze, copper, silver, gold and ivory; kakemono; screens; cotton, hempen, woolen and silk goods; vases; pottery, earthen ware and porcelain; musical instruments (native and foreign); photographs; bamboo and willow wares; toys, books; paper, pens (fude) and ink; canes, umbrellas, fans; toilet articles, head-gear and foot-gear; kimono and other articles of dress; shell-ware; furniture and decorations; straw The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 79 </page> <page sequence="7"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 80 goods; tools and implements; lanterns; cocoons; illustrative or advertising pho- tographs, sketches, paintings, cards, circulars, pamphlets and books.17 In her 1894 Fans of Japan, Charlotte Maria Salwey reports that in 1890 al- most four and a half million Japanese fans were imported into the United States—more than its fair share of the roughly fifteen and half million fans Japan exported that year.18 It is worth noting at the outset, then, the sheer quantity and diversity of Japanese things that entered the United States in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Japanese things would be associated not only with the singularity of the aesthetic object but also with a sometimes dizzying sense of copiousness associated with the commodity. This quantitative influx of Japanese things coincided with a qualitative transformation in the general meaning of things in the Gilded Age, nicely described by Bill Brown as “an era when the invention, production, distribu- tion, and consumption of things rather suddenly came to define a national culture.”19 It is in this historical context that the complex particularity of the Japanese thing emerges: the American enthusiasm for things Japanese fed both the rise of the commodity and the rise of an antimodernist, vaguely an- ticapitalist ideology that sought alternatives to the culture of mass consump- tion. Japanese things excelled in the former area by appealing to the con- cerns of the latter. Indeed, the Japanese government used the American Centenary as an occasion to sell to Western markets exactly the version of Japan they were looking for, accompanying their wares with an English-lan- guage catalog in which, writes art historian William Hosley, “the gospel of anti-modernism [was] mirrored back at its preachers” (Japan Idea, 39).“By means created by modernization,” he explains, “Japan was able to sell the idea of its traditional culture to the West” (28). As Hosley’s formulation suggests, the contradictions of japonisme paral- lel those of the broader U.S. arts and crafts movement, whose antimodernist impulses have been famously discussed in T. J. Jackson Lears’s No Place of Grace. Lears makes only a handful of passing references to japonisme, but he does describe it as consonant with the arts and crafts revival generally: “To some craft revivalists, the most appealing model was ‘that land of . . . divine obedience to authority,’ Japan. In their view, neither the Tokugawa wood- carver nor the contemporary Japanese showed the restless discontent of American workers; both seemed content with their ‘simple life.’”20 More- over, the three major areas of antimodernism Lears discusses all have their counterpoints in japonisme: “Aesthetes and reformers sought to recover the hard but satisfying life of the medieval craftsman; militarists urged the rekin- dling of archaic martial vigor; religious doubters yearned for the fierce con- victions of the peasant and the ecstasies of the mystic” (xv).21 80 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="8"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 81 The central conclusion of Lears’s study is that “American antimod- ernism unknowingly provided part of the psychological foundation for a streamlined liberal culture appropriate to twentieth-century consumer capitalism” (6). As a complex mixture of identification and difference, primitivism and futurism, nationalism and exoticism, and materialism and idealism, American japonisme similarly expressed an ambivalent and overdetermined anticapitalism that was enabled by and ultimately helped fa- cilitate the development of a culture of consumption. The Japanese thing was both a transnationally circulating object that helped the United States imagine a form of pure nationalism and a bought-and-sold commodity that facilitated the imagining of an anticommodity. Thus, while Japanese things constituted an important part of the material history of U.S. transnational- ism in a very straightforward sense, they also participated in a symbolic econ- omy of values that combated and enhanced the commercial economy they were imagined to protest. Rather than simply arguing that Japanese things were commodified, therefore, I want to suggest that their singular success as both actual commodities and exemplary anticommodities might offer useful lessons about the broader culture of things and thingliness in the nine- teenth century. If recognizing the historical context of emergent consumer culture tells us something about japonisme as a particular aesthetic ideology, japonisme, conversely, represents a potential source of insight into the cul- ture of the commodity. I offer here as a representative source one of the earliest American texts on Japanese art, James Jackson Jarves’s A Glimpse at the Art of Japan, from the centennial year 1876, extracting from his study a handful of features that de- fine, for him, the specificity of the Japanese object:22 1. Japanese workmanship is superior because of the continued—and perceptible— use of hand labor. Even the untrained eye, Jarves writes, can immediately rec- ognize the more human and more natural results and their stark contrast with the products of mechanized labor. 2. The artisanal virtues of Japanese things correspond to a political economy. In an overdetermined mix of political rhetorics, Jarves describes the Japanese thing as a deeply democratic expression of the Japanese Volksgeist, the manifes- tation of universal aesthetic values rooted in nature, and, not least, an artifact of an era of production that is rapidly becoming extinct as it is forced into com- petition with foreign economies—an era he looks back on with at least a hint of nostalgia: “The workman was a thorough worker and master of his particular art. . . . Usually he labored by himself, in his own cottage, or else with sympa- thetic associates on such branches of art as had been slowly perfected by many generations of his ancestors under the fostering care of their feudal lords” (136). The appearance of this beneficent feudal lord recalls the politically re- actionary tendencies of the American arts and crafts movement as described by Lears. The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 81 </page> <page sequence="9"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 82 3. Each and every Japanese thing is a manifestation of national character, in stark contrast to the commercial and artistic products of the contemporary Western world: “Our modern life tends to the obliteration of local and individual dis- tinctions of taste and character, replacing them by a cosmopolitan uniformity of manners and ideas. It is a powerful solvent, pitilessly consuming all that which is most fascinating in the past without so far yielding in return any ade- quate artistic compensation” (16). Jarves both praises and worries for the uniqueness of the Japanese aesthetic in the context of ever-expanding global markets and the “solvent” of cosmopolitan consumption. 4. Last, the Japanese aesthetic unites craft and art, utility and the ideal, a bond that affirms both the particularity and the universality of the Japanese aes- thetic: “No race excels the Japanese in changing iron, paper, clay, and like sub- stances into things of absolute artistic value and loveliness, moulding and stamping them by slight of hand and cunning of invention into the universal currency of mind, and causing the crude ore, earth, or vegetable, to disclose its aesthetic possibilities” (173). The “aesthetic vernacular” of the Japanese is, un- like that of modern Europeans, “bone of their bone, flesh of their flesh, born of their own feelings and sentiments” (105–6), but it also produces a “universal currency of mind” that translates into other kinds of currency fairly well. By somehow always participating in both the particularity of Japanese na- tional character and the universality of the aesthetic, the Japanese thing re- sists dissolution in the “solvent” of cosmopolitanism, on the one hand, and yet remains eminently translatable into a “universal currency,” on the other. To unpack the cultural significance of this duality, we might begin with the context of the nineteenth-century production of “object lessons,” a collusion of commodification, museology, and ethnography that Brown describes as “a belief that objects (as opposed to words) would speak to more people (young and old, immigrants and natives) in a universal language—[a belief that] was beginning to become a part of daily life” (Sense, 109). It was also in the centennial year that the U.S. National Cabinet of Curiosities was re- named the U.S. National Museum, signaling its project of “eradicating the ‘chance assemblage of curiosities,’ discarding the ‘cemetery of bric-à-brac,’ and replacing it with a ‘nursery of living thoughts’” (Sense, 87).23 The Japanese thing responds to this demand that things not only serve a specific function but also be organically related to the specific “culture” from whose nursery they have been plucked. The singular reliability of the Japanese thing, its charge to be an example that always makes a good exam- ple, therefore participates in a broader cultural project and reflects a broader cultural need. Western Japan enthusiasts were impressed by any number of specific aspects of Japanese culture, but the thing that united nearly all observers—from Paris to Vienna to Chicago—was a powerful sense of the unity of Japanese culture, a unity expressed in the coherence of its aes- thetic. It was this unity of culture and this unity of the aesthetic—this unity of the cultural and the aesthetic—that made the aesthetic truly an aesthetic 82 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="10"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 83 and the culture truly a culture. “To call it artistic sensibility is to use too lim- ited a term,” writes Percival Lowell in his popular and influential early work The Soul of the Far East (1888), “for it pervades the entire people; rather it is a sixth sense of a natural, because national description; for the trait differs from our corresponding feeling in degree and especially in universality enough to merit the distinction.”24 Such accounts, in the work of Lowell and others, of the remarkable omnipresence of an aesthetic sensibility among the Japanese, are paired with what is in many ways a contradictory claim about that sensibility, namely that it is universal, not merely among all Japanese—the sense in which Lowell uses the word here—but in a stronger, indeed the strongest possible sense. If the Japanese are a uniquely artistic people it must be remembered that, after all, “it is to his humanity, not to his individuality, that [art] whispers, for she speaks in that universal tongue which all can understand” (121–23). Japanese culture is, in sum, uniquely, particularly, peculiarly universal. Such a contradiction is unremarkable in the immediate context of japon- isme (all “isms” embrace contradictions), but considered in the broader con- text of the simultaneous rise of antimodernism and consumer culture this contradiction signals something more than the incoherence of an exoticiz- ing fetishism. What does it matter if the Japanese thing is understood to be a good representative of something universal because it is such a good repre- sentative of something nationally particular? The significance of this com- plex becomes clearer when we consider the role of things in the formation of U.S. consumer-citizens. Brown specifically claims that “the production of consumer desire . . . succeeds because consumption, possession, accumula- tion, and display appear as modes through which one might solve the onto- logical dilemma posed by the structural fact of inhabiting a democratic state” (48); that is, “the accumulation of objects might be considered the (futile) effort to materialize that abstraction [of democracy]—to fill up that abstraction, as it were, with particular contents” (47). If capitalist societies in general tend to produce an ontological ambiguity between being and hav- ing, the “classless” society of the United States produces particularly acute forms of this ambiguity. And indeed the notion of things as props or substi- tutes for some ostensibly more deeply rooted form of identity can be found throughout the American tradition. If we look back to Edgar Allen Poe’s “Philosophy of Furniture” (1840) we find the claim that because Americans “have no aristocracy of blood,” they have “fashioned for [them]selves an aris- tocracy of dollars.” “By a transition readily understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen,” Poe continues, “we have been brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste itself.”25 Looking ahead to mod- ernism: William Carlos Williams’s “To Elsie” (1923)—which opens with the oft-quoted line “The pure products of America go crazy”—laments the The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 83 </page> <page sequence="11"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 84 “young slatterns” who, on Saturday night are “to be tricked out . . . with gauds/ from imaginations which have no/peasant traditions to give them/ character”; they can only “flutter and flaunt/ sheer rags.” No aristocracy; no peasants: just pure products, sheer rags, and show.26 Japan, by contrast, still had aristocrats and peasants aplenty and its products, pure in a quite differ- ent sense, meant what they said and said what they meant, a refreshing virtue in a thing encountered in a “Gilded Age.” The coding of the Japanese thing as simultaneously ethnic-particular and aesthetic-universal, then, was not merely a marketing ploy; it responded to fundamental and pressing concerns about the instability of democratic subjects in a society at once capitalist (specifically consumerist), democratic, and increasingly multiethnic. The Japanese thing would thus seem to go against Marx’s classic account of the commodity in that far from presenting itself as sui generis, its value is produced precisely by its signifying that it is a product of human labor, specifically of a localizable source and mode of production. If the classic commodity form is said to disguise social relations among persons as objec- tive relations among things, the japoniste commodity would present as some sort of human encounter what are in fact market relations. These aren’t mu- tually exclusive, of course—just a question of how many dialectical whacks one gives the piñata of the commodity form. Indeed, already in Marx’s ac- count the commodity’s lies, analyzed, are its truth.27 The aesthetic valoriza- tion of the Japanese thing therefore implies a critique, however flawed, of the commodity. While Marxian anticapitalism of course focuses on the social relations that are understood to precipitate in the commodity, japoniste anti- capitalism’s attention remains far more focused on the commodity itself.28 The specificity of this “Japanese” thing resides in the way its and/or, neither/ nor character is expressed: unlike the mere commodity, which is rootless and trivial, the Japanese thing is bound to and expresses a historically deep and essentially integral national culture; yet unlike the art object, the Japanese thing is useful and likes to travel. Or so the story goes. The Japanese thing answers the false universality of quantitative, global, monetary ex- change value with its own, differently false, universality: that of the qualitative values of the national and the aesthetic. Japonisme would disavow the dissolv- ing, homogenizing effects of capital—the universal solvent—while retaining the dream of global exchange based on a common standard—a universal cur- rency of mind.29 The account of the kind of mass production identified with Japanese wares differs from standard accounts of the mass-produced commodity be- cause one of the dominant motifs of japoniste discourse is precisely the refusal of repetition and uniformity. Jarves writes at length about “the decided objec- tion, indeed absolute dislike of uniform designs and repetitions of details . . . as if the Japanese brain had an instinctive hatred of duplicating any decorative 84 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="12"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 85 composition or even article, whether artistic or not” (169–70). In Jarves’s Japan, “The commonest object has its distinctive artistic physiognomy, even if it be repeated millions of times, and costing only a penny each” (168). Here we see again the fantasy of resolving quantity and quality. If the mod- ernist thing was intended to be the unique or singularly obdurate object in opposition to the mass-produced object, the japoniste thing represented, proleptically, at once a kind of supreme modernist object and a super- commodity in that it offered mass produced unique objects, an economy of qualities within an economy of quantities—solid objects that for a time seemed to manage being universal without melting into air.30 “a collection of things” The preceding sections have laid out the general ways in which the Japanese thing constituted an ambiguous anticommodity reflecting an ambiguous relationship between nationalism and transnational capital. Here I wish to explicate further the ethnic character of this thing and its re- lationship to the commodity.31 I want to argue that things have an “ethnic- ity” not just in the sense that they can signify or represent their national or ethnic origin, but also in the sense that that their thingliness can be consti- tuted in ways analogous and related to structures of racialization. While such a structure no doubt frequently entails some metonymic appeal to ori- gins (this box is “Japanese” because it comes from Japan and/or was made by a Japanese person), there is more to it than that. In addition to the metonymic relationship of origin, there is what might be called the internal metaphoricity of the thing, the imaginary of its ontological difference.32 The complex articulations of universality and particularity implicit in the at once aesthetic and ethnic determinations of the Japanese thing are not ex- clusively superstructural symptoms of the commodity structure. Rather than thinking of the ethnic and aesthetic as essentially human traits or val- ues that can be “objectified” and then “commodified,” we might imagine a less hierarchized, more multidirectional model in which reification, com- modification, aestheticization, and racialization can be understood as his- torically related modalities of the relationship between abstraction and con- cretion (including personification). I claimed earlier that the japoniste conception of the Japanese thing rep- resented a kind of critique of the commodity form. That conception similarly embodies a kind of theory of reification, but the contradictory character of this theory of reification is even more apparent than is that of the critique of the commodity because the very concept of reification is itself more immedi- ately contradictory. As Timothy Bewes writes, “the hypothetical event of total reification would, logically at least, be the end of reification. . . . Reification The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 85 </page> <page sequence="13"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 86 both promises and denies the possibility of reconciliation between sub- ject and object.”33 In other words, the implicit nightmare of theories of reification—the total thingification of the human and the implicit dream that drives their critiques, the unity of Subject and Object in a nonreified world—are difficult if not impossible to distinguish in any rigorous way. The very stakes of reification and its critique are thus inherently ambiguous: “Reification is not the antithesis of humanity but, as Adorno points out, an element of it; reification is not only ‘the condition from which liberation is possible,’ but—in a reified society at least—the means by which ‘subjective impulses are realized’” (80). Considered in such a context, japonisme again expresses contradictory anticapitalist impulses, but in contrast to Marxian theory, which takes as its point of departure the fragmented character of life under capitalism, japonisme takes as its point of departure what it imagines to be the artifacts of an achieved unity. Japonisme’s logic was, in short, aes- thetic rather than political. Although such a distinction inevitably brings to mind Walter Benjamin’s famous contrast between the fascist aestheticization of the political and the communist politicization of the aesthetic—and I will further discuss the implicitly right-wing character of japonisme in a moment— this dyad leaves unmentioned what is arguably the most fundamental social category of American life in the later nineteenth century, namely, race. Recalling the broader historical context of the dynamics of capitalist ab- straction and reification, not only might we understand the racialization of things as one of the ways in which the American racial imaginary con- cretized itself, but we might also understand that racial imaginary itself as a way of giving form to the dynamics of abstraction and concretion. Corre- spondingly, what I have been calling the “ethnicity” of the Japanese thing might be understood not as a characteristic of people that can be projected onto things via anthropomorphism, but rather as a more general structural relation that might even be said to be primarily about things, given the ex- tent to which it “reifies” or “objectifies” people insofar as it defines them. To be more precise: the relationship between the ethnic and nonethnic can be produced in conjunction with the same cultural logic that distinguishes per- son and thing. That is, ethnicity is not a property of any given particular but is rather something produced relationally, through, and indeed as a kind of, division of labor. Its particularity is not something that is or is not amenable to being adapted to the universal, but rather something pro- duced as ethnic by a putative universal. As Rey Chow argues, “The experi- ence of migration . . . simply highlights and amplifies the connection be- tween commodified labor and ethnicization that takes place in a society even when there are no migrants, even when migrants have become citi- zens.”34 Ethnicization in general, then, would have to be understood as the positing of a structure of surface particularity overlaying a universal substance, 86 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="14"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 87 a relationship that not only applies to person and thing alike but can also govern that distinction. Such ethnic things would both provoke and help to resolve a kind of on- tological immigration problem in which, as with human immigration, the immigré is both necessary and a cause of uncertainty about just what’s from where and what it all means for value. How useful, in such a context, then, to have the pure products of Japan, things that, as Salwey writes, “are not shy things, . . . [but] speak for themselves, and tell us where they come from” (31). The value of the Japanese thing is produced by its being overtly foreign and substantially “universal,” that is, different enough to produce value but also assimilable enough to do so: a kind of model minority thing. This general economy of symbolic migration and citizenship reflects the peculiar status of the Japanese thing as an anticapitalist commodity with a corresponding imaginary noncapitalist production.35 This imaginary mode of production again reflects the conflicted character of japonisme’s anticapi- talism, both emphasizing (against the abstract universality of capital) and denying (in the name of the concrete universality of the aesthetic) what Chow calls “the ethnicization of labor.” Colleen Lye has traced many of the ways in which the discourse on Chinese coolies and on Asiatic labor more generally became “a primary idiom for representing social abstraction” (70) at a time when the ethnic character of U.S. labor was being reconfigured under the dual pressures of, on the one hand, the emergence of a post- Reconstruction economy and, on the other, the massive immigration of “new” ethnic groups, including East Asians but also Eastern Europeans, Ital- ians, Irish, and others who tested the socioeconomic meanings of whiteness. This whiteness was constructed in opposition both to preindustrial labor forms (Euro-American modernity versus non-Western premodernity) and to industrial labor (the nobility of Anglo-Saxon hand labor and farm work ver- sus the mechanistic toiling of the Slav).36 While the Chinese coolie was identified primarily with the latter (the de- humanizing effects of industrial labor), until the end of the nineteenth cen- tury the Japanese worker played neither of these roles in the U.S. labor imagi- nary. Japanese labor was, as we have seen, imagined to be a kind of atavistic remainder of something very much like the noble Anglo-Saxon medieval handwork whose final traces were being lost to industrial modernity. Put schematically, if Chinese labor figured the dangers of industrial modernity, Japanese labor figured a salutary alternative, a feudal past and therapeutic future. While the Chinese coolie represented the horrors of modernity by embodying both its abstractness (as faceless working mass) and the unfortu- nate realities of the actual conditions of “free” labor, the Japanese hand- worker figured, as premodern, a utopian modernity of consumption, one in which beautiful things are cheaply available to all, with no alienated labor at The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 87 </page> <page sequence="15"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 88 the base of the economic pyramid.37 It is indeed the case with Japan, as with China, that for America figurations of “the East [functioned] as a Western proxy rather than an antipode” of modernity (America’s Asia, 10), but with the important qualification that Japan was antipode and proxy, antipode as proxy: lost idyllic past and posthistorical future. Again, in contrast to coolie labor, this imaginary of Japanese labor was constructed less from Japanese immigrants—Japanese immigration to the United States becomes substan- tial only beginning in the 1890s—than from a fantasy of the working condi- tions in Old Japan, a fantasy largely generated by the massive influx of Japanese things. Keeping in mind this broader historical context of the relationship be- tween racialization and labor in the nineteenth-century United States, I would now like to turn back toward the problem of the Japanese thing as an ethnic thing by considering a European and more classically Marxian analy- sis of the relationship between racialization and the commodity. Moishe Pos- tone explores the Nazi imaginary of race in relation to the contradictory ways in which it both replicated and disavowed the commodity structure. Ac- cording to Postone, Nazi ideology represents a form of Romantic anticapital- ism that merely reverses capitalism’s valorization of the antimony of abstract and concrete, seeking to restore concrete reality against the false universal- ism and abstraction of capital. Rather than critiquing the antinomy itself, Po- stone argues, such “forms of romanticism and revolt . . . hypostatize the con- crete and thereby remain bound within the antinomy of capitalist social relations.”38 Postone links this cultural symptom of the commodity structure to a cor- responding problem in the character of modern European citizenship, namely that in Europe “the notion of the nation as a purely political entity, abstracted from the substantiality of civil society, was never fully realized” (312). In the radicalized form of this problem in Nazi ideology, the abstract citizen-subject of the nation-state corresponds to the abstract dimension of capital, with the negatives of each being projected onto European Jews as “the only group in Europe that fulfilled the determination of citizenship as a pure political abstraction” (212–13). The profoundly racialized character of this ideology results from its attribution of all the negative qualities of capi- talist abstraction to “the Jew”—“mysteriously intangible, abstract, and univer- sal” (305)—not as a symbolic possibility or even contingent fact, but as a nec- essary and concrete manifestation of capitalist abstraction as such: “The Jews were not seen merely as representatives of capital. . . . They became the person- ifications of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful and interna- tional domination of capital as an alienated social form” (311–12). Like this German ideology, American japonisme represents a racialized romantic anticapitalism whose fetishizing pursuit of the concrete confounds 88 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="16"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 89 ordinary understandings of the distinction between person and thing. Pos- tone’s work demonstrates some of the ways in which racialization can be a function of the commodity, but it also suggests, I would argue, that the com- modity—abjected or adored—can itself be a thoroughly racialized concept. While “the Jew” represents a displaced vision of the commodity form that Nazism ostensibly rejects but in fact promotes and intensifies, the Japanese thing represents a contradictory logic of racialization that japonisme dis- places into an alternative vision of the commodity. These two forms of racial- izing, fetishized anticapitalism are contrasted not only by their obviously dif- ferent degrees of political violence and by their reversed directionality (Nazism treats people like things while japonisme treats things like people) but also by their contrasting valorization of the racialized object (be it per- son or thing): while “the Jew,” for Nazi ideology, is the abject embodiment of the evils of modernity, the Japanese thing embodies, for the American japoniste, precisely the rooted, the national, and the concrete, that is, the or- ganic civil society antimodernist anticapitalism mourns and seeks to recover. Although it is not explicitly formulated as such, this implicit relationship between reification and racialization inflects much of American japoniste discourse. The Japanese thing functioned as a synecdoche not simply of “Japan,” then, but also of an even more vaguely imagined other world in which the basic categories of person and property were both radically differ- ent and yet strangely familiar. Lowell, for example, describes the Japanese as “nomadic . . . in the property of their persons”; unable to belong to them- selves, he asserts, they remain the property of the collective.39 This funda- mental disenfranchisement is, according to Lowell, apparent in every partic- ular of Japanese culture, most tellingly in the language’s implicit conception of man: A Japanese noun is a crystallized concept, handed down unchanged from the child- hood of the Japanese race. So primitive a conception does it represent that it is nei- ther a total nor a partial symbol, but rather the outcome of a first vague generality. The word “man,” for instance, means to them not one man, still less mankind, but that indefinite idea which struggles for embodiment in the utterance of the infant. It represents not a person but a thing, a material fact quite innocent of gender. This early state of Japanese semi-consciousness, the Japanese never outgrew. The world continued to present itself to their minds as a collection of things. (92) “As if to give the official seal to the oneness of man with the universe,” Low- ell adds, “the word mono, thing, is applied, without the faintest implication of insult, to men” (107). The notion of an Oriental lack of individuality and the crippling effects of this lack on the development of a modern civil soci- ety, has, of course, long been a central theme in Western imaginings of an Oriental “sleep of ages” (Whitman) from which modernity was to awaken it. To awaken it specifically to a world defined by the exchange of things: The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 89 </page> <page sequence="17"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 90 “So communistic a want of discrimination between the meum and the tuum,” Lowell specifies, “would seem to be as fatal to the interchange of thoughts as it proves destructive to the trafficking in commodities” (82). Lowell’s critique of the limitations of Japanese culture is flatly contradic- tory. On the one hand he sees a language in which the “indefinite idea . . . struggles for embodiment” and a labor system in which “the tendency of the occupation in the abstract to swallow up the individual in the concrete is as evident to theory as it is patent in practice” (49); on the other he complains that “the Japanese mind is quite the reverse of abstract. Its consideration of things is concrete to a primitive degree” (106). That is, Lowell criticizes Japanese both for its excessive abstractness and its excessive concreteness, for its reduction of man to a mere thing and for its failure to develop a com- mercial culture of ownership and possession. This complex of internally conflicted praise and blame recalls the fact that America’s Japan was less a simple antipode (for better or worse) than an overdetermined, sometimes uncanny double of American modernity. Low- ell’s concerns about the ways cultures do or do not distinguish between per- sons and things were, after all, far from exotic. The year Lowell left for Japan saw a series of landmark Civil Rights Cases (1883), and he himself had nu- merous personal and family connections to major figures in the abolitionist movement.40 In sum, the often thematically “aesthetic” or “exotic” concerns of Lowell and other Japan enthusiasts reflected broader cultural tensions of the American Gilded Age, an age in which things were increasingly imbued with human value in any number of ways, and in which the very real senses in which persons were to be distinguished from things were still being played out in the courts and in society at large.41 Japan Black Just as “china” became a common noun for porcelain and related wares, “japan” long served as a common noun for various kinds of lacquer, and over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries became synonymous with blackening in general. The OED contains some delightful examples, including “japanned by the smoke of centuries” and “Japan your shoes, your Honour?”42 Even after synthetic lacquers were developed in the twentieth century, the name still stuck: “Japan Black” was the color of all those Model Ts Henry Ford famously joked you could get in any color you liked. A tropological displacement of the surface quality of lacquer onto Japaneseness more generally can be found in numerous early commenta- tors, specifically when they formulate their concerns about the extent to which Japan has really, truly become modern. Griffis, for example, argues 90 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="18"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 91 that if Japan does not adopt Christianity, “little will be gained but a glittering veneer of material civilization” and “in the presence of the superior aggres- sive nations of the West, Dai Nippon must fall like the doomed races of America” (578).43 Ernest Fenollosa similarly remarks that critics of Japan “declare that the recent progress is a farce, a veneer over barbarism” (“Com- ing Fusion,” 116), and Lowell too thinks of the Japanese in terms of their fin- ish, signifying both their charm and their inability to undergo substantive change: “The descendants of this rude forefather [the Tartars] have now taken on a polish of which their own exquisite lacquer gives but a faint re- flection. The surface was perfected after the substance was formed. Our word finish, with its double meaning, expresses both the process and the re- sult” (Soul of the Far East, 10). Of course Japanese aesthetics have, in the West, long been associated ei- ther with great depth or with mere surface, but I am suggesting that this per- sistent tropological possibility at least in part reflects an ongoing concern about the problem of a non-Euro-American modernity. All that concern about the superficiality or depth of the soul of the Far Easterner was one way to formulate questions the United States was facing with respect both to its new immigrant populations and to the modernity it was vigorously export- ing, or at least trying to. Is race a veneer that conceals a universal subject fit for modernity or is modernity merely a veneer that conceals the truth of race? On the one hand, a surface to be overlooked (sure, they look differ- ent, but really they’re just like “us”); on the other, a different kind of surface, one that is not to be trusted (they seem American, but at their core they’re Japanese).44 One could imagine using the permutations of such a logic to compose a very schematic history of diverse conceptions of Asian Americanness. The particulars of the dialectical interplay would be of crucial importance at any given historical moment, of course, but here I want to step back and con- sider the meaning of the possibilities as possibilities. The permutations of such a hermeneutic of surface and depth would not, after all, have been his- torically available to African Americans in anything like the same way.45 More broadly and more speculatively, I would suggest that my discussion of the “ethnic thing” provides a kind of structural genealogy, a partial prehis- tory of the racialization and ostensible deracialization of Asian America, specifically the narrative in which “Asian” is said to have evolved from a racial type to an ethnic accent. Such a conception of Asian ethnicity as an ac- ceptable veneer only contingently obscuring an underlying universal hu- manity would correspond to the problematic role of Asian Americans as “model minorities” in a putatively colorblind, post–civil rights era United States.46 It is in this sense that I have been working with a heuristic distinction between “race,” designating a world of qualitative and absolute differences in The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 91 </page> <page sequence="19"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 92 which there is no medium of universal exchange, and “ethnicity,” designating a relative and ostensibly superficial set of differences held to be subordinate to a fundamental equivalence and, not least, corresponding to an economy of absolute exchangeability and a political language of universal humanity and Libertad.47 To be cultured in the United States of the nineteenth century meant to be a collector of Japanese things, even as Percival Lowell and others com- plained that in Japan people were but “a collection of things.” Indeed “cul- ture” as such seemed at that time increasingly to be concretizable, perhaps even imaginable, only as a collocation of object lessons. By traveling far be- yond the culture of its origin while still remaining “true” to the conditions of its putatively artisanal making, the Japanese thing lingered on the threshold of commoditization, of a translation into the universal currency of . . . currency. Through a metonymic displacement seemingly too tempting to resist, “Japan” came to name more generally a relationship of “surface” and “depth” in which irreducible alterity, value-generating difference, and ultimate same- ness could precipitate into a simulacrum of dynamic, productive, and prof- itable unity. The aesthetic quality of the Japanese thing thus also figures the intimacy of the overtly hostile and the putatively valorizing aspects of racialization: the violence of classic racism and the violence of assimilative universalism. It is in this sense that the moral valence of the Japanese thing’s “objectification” of culture implies the broader importance of a theory of the “ethnic” thing, of the Thing as an expression of the idea of ethnicity as such (beyond its signi- fying, in different ways in different contexts, one particular ethnicity or an- other). After all, for most of its history the West treated Asian things as more valuable than Asian people, which suggests that the history of objectifica- tion, its political commitments and its consequences, is still waiting to be written.

While Japanese immigration represented just 0.01 percent of all U.S. immigra- tion during the 1860s and 70s (averaging about 16 people per year during that time), it grew to 0.04 percent (2,270 people) during the 1880s and then jumped to 0.70 percent (just under 26,000 people) for the 1890s and then to 1.48 percent (just under 130,000 people) during the first decade of the twenti- eth century. Paul R. Spickard, Japanese Americans (New York, 1996), 21. 11. The former overlaps with and draws on Colleen Lye’s concept of “Asiatic racial form,” from which I take two important points. The first is that Asiatic racial form reflected the broader contradictions of America’s self-definition as both capitalist and democratic such that, far from being a question of “minority” his- tory, already in the nineteenth century the question of the “Asiatic” was at the heart of issues central to America’s modernization at home and its rise as an imperial power abroad. The second major point I take from Lye concerns her warning about the limitations of “the anthropomorphism of Asiatic form,” al- though my own alignment of this de-anthropomorphization with things in a fairly conventional sense involves a deliberate imbrication of rather different senses of “materiality” that I believe her work would insist should remain dis- tinct; Colleen Lye, America’s Asia (Princeton, 2004). 12. On the one hand, then, we might say that Japanese things are examples of a broader cultural logic of things; on the other hand, however, it seems that not just any thing reveals that logic, or, better: it seems that different things reveal that logic differently. I am certainly not claiming, then, that japonisme pro- vides the only possible point of entry into the relationship between racializa- tion and the commodity, for example, but simply that it is a privileged example and therefore more than an “example.” Precisely because it raises questions about universality and particularity, the example of the Japanese thing and the exemplarity of the Japanese thing are difficult to distinguish. 13.

While my focus here is on the aesthetic, it is worth noting of the last two points, respectively, that the “classic” Bushido: The Soul of Japan was written in English 94 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="22"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 95 for Americans and published in 1899 (around the time Theodore Roosevelt had a judo room set up in the White House) and that interest in Buddhism among American japonistes was so strong that Ernest Fenollosa, William Stur- gis Bigelow, and their fellow Japan-enthusiasts were known as “the Boston Bud- dhists.” On the early success of judo in the United States, see Benfey, Great Wave; on the religious inclinations of the “Boston Buddhists,” see Benfey, Great Wave, and Chisolm, Fenollosa. One might also consider here Lafcadio Hearn’s intense interest in Shinto. Lears, No Place of Grace, ultimately relativizes the importance, for the Amer- ican arts and crafts movement, of japonisme in relation to medieval European inspirations, because the former were “too alien” (113). Here I disagree with Lears: the foreignness of Japan was an essential part of its appeal. While this foreignness might hinder the kind of back-to-roots identification found in me- dievalism, this is not to say that it could not have played an important role in conceptions of national identity, because neither is all identity based on identi- fication nor is it all based on an imagined historical past. Indeed, “Japan” was one of the ways in which the historical contradictions of the arts and crafts movement were expressed, including the importance of international com- merce to a revival of national handcraft. 22.

That is, on the one hand the commodity form mystifies and conceals social rela- tions among people by presenting them as objective relations among things, but on the other hand for this very reason they provide a kind of “social hiero- glyphic,” the decoding of which renders legible the degree to which under capitalism relations among people are in fact transformed into relations among The Ethnicity of Things in America’s Lacquered Age 95 </page> <page sequence="23"> REP99_04.qxd  6/27/07  9:50 M  Page 96 commodities, while those among commodities become increasingly personi- fied. See especially Karl Marx, Capital, trans. Ben Fowkes (New York, 1990), 1:163–78. 28. Lears’s account of the American arts and crafts movement, of which he con- siders japonisme to be a part, presents an anticapitalism that is almost wholly aestheticist in character, so much so that the decline in the quality of hand- made goods is a far greater evil than the working conditions to which that de- cline corresponds: working conditions need to be improved for the sake of things. Conversely, one could well argue that for Marx neither objectification nor even the commodity form per se are social ills: “Alienation is created in capitalist society not by the production of commodities but by the transforma- tion of this production, according to political economy, from objectified hu- man actuality into ‘objective’ laws which independently regulate human activ- ity”; Shlomo Avineri, The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx (Cambridge, 1968), 107. 29. Harry Harootunian writes that exoticism, broadly construed, “must be seen as an attempt to redress the imbalance between quantity and quality by finding a time and place where the latter still prevailed”; Harry Harootunian, foreword to Victor Segalen, Essay on Exoticism, trans. Yael Rachel Schlick (Durham, 2002), x. 30. We might then understand the Japanese thing as a fantasy of resolved conflict in the sense that for Fredric Jameson, as Brown writes, “Literature functions to invent ‘imaginary or formal “solutions” to unresolvable social contradictions’ in the act of restructuring ‘a prior historical or ideological subtext,’ a subtext made legible by the text itself (and thus not genuinely ‘prior’)” (Brown, Mate- rial, 14). In terms of the issues with which I am concerned here: the aesthetic charge of the Japanese thing has far less to do with the condition of Japanese premodernity than with the contradictions plaguing American culture in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Important recent accounts of the mod- ernist object include Douglas Mao, Solid Objects (Princeton, 1998), and Jon Er- ickson, The Fate of the Object (Ann Arbor, 1995). 31. Important works on the theorization of the thing include Arjun Appadurai, ed., The Social Life of Things (New York, 1986), Susan Buck-Morss, The Dialectics of Seeing (Cambridge, Mass., 1989), and Susan Stewart, On Longing (Baltimore, 1984).  32. As Brown notes: “Marx describes a doubleness that characterizes not just the commodity object, but inalienable objects as well. The aggression of capitalism lies not least in its ability to appropriate the doubleness of objects: to convert the thingness of the object (the Thing in excess of the object) into value” (Sense, 42). 33.

Discussing the relationship between ethnicity and labor, Chow writes: “The positivistic view that ethnics are, indeed, aliens from elsewhere, in fact ends up lending support to the concept of ethnicity as an a priori, essentialist condition of foreignness. . . . the ethnic as such stands in modernity as the site of a for- eignness that is produced from within privileged societies and is at once de- fined by and constitutive of that society’s hierarchical divisions of labor” (34).

My trope of immigrating things may seem less fanciful if one recalls the still re- cent historical fact of people being imported. See Moon-Ho Jung, “Outlawing ‘Coolies’: Race, Nation, and Empire in the Age of Emancipation,” American Quarterly 57, no. 3 (September 2005): 694–99. 36. For a general history of immigration during this period in relation to imperial- ism and the need for foreign markets, especially the China market, see Matthew Frye Jacobson, Barbarian Virtues: The United States Encounters Foreign Peoples at Home and Abroad, 1876–1917 (New York, 2000). 37. The discourse of japonisme thus confirms—in a rather different way than do the examples she considers—Lye’s claim that “a genealogy of Asian American stereotype is discernable in the historical failures of class critique” (America’s Asia, 11).

Lowell describes the Japanese as “a people as nomadic now in the property of their persons as their forefathers were in their real estate” (Soul of the Far East, 71). 40. Lowell was a second cousin of abolitionist writer James Russell Lowell and was also related to Charles Russell Lowell, a Union brigadier general killed in ac- tion during the Civil War—and husband of Josephine Shaw, sister of Robert Gould Shaw. 41. On the cultural meanings of property law in later nineteenth-century America, see Stephen Best, The Fugitive’s Properties: The Law and the Poetics of Possession (Chicago, 2004). In such a context, passages in Lowell that are overtly about Spencerian problems of the historical progress of the world-soul can also be read as articulations of the problem of citizenship in a democracy: “The soul, in its progress through the world, tends inevitably to individualization. Yet the more we perceive of the cosmos the more do we recognize an all-pervading unity in it. Its soul must be one, not many. The divine power that made all things is not itself multifold. How to reconcile the ever-increasing divergence with an eventual similarity is a problem at present transcending our generaliza- tions. What we know would seem to be opposed to what we must infer. But per- ception of how we shall merge the personal in the universal, though at present hidden from sight, may sometime come to us, and the seemingly irreconcilable will then turn out to involve no contradiction at all” (Lowell, Soul of the Far East, 224–25). 42.

The association of the Japanese with Native Americans—up to and including speculations of a common genealogy—is another example of the ways in which the major issues of nineteenth-century American political consciousness mark the “fad” of japonisme. 44. One might also note here the use of “ornamental” as racial slur for “oriental.” Even if the term is phonetically derived, it “works” because it resonates with a recognizable logic of racialization. 45. It is here that the contrast between the logic of racialization and what I would dis- tinguish as the japoniste logic of ethnic-racialization part ways most decisively: in Nazi ideology a Jew remains a Jew no matter what, while in the American ideol- ogy the ethnic other always hides an American beneath the surface.

Takashi Fujitani’s piece in this issue discusses the proximity and indeed affinity of the most intensely aggressive moment of Asian-racialization in American his- tory—the internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War— and the reconfiguration of the Asian American as the model minority. See also Lye, America’s Asia. On the history of Asian American racialization see Claire Jean Kim, “The Racial Triangulation of Asian Americans,” Politics and Society 27, no. 1 (1999): 105–38, and Susan Koshy, “Morphing Race into Ethnicity: Asian Americans and Critical Transformations of Whiteness,” Boundary 2 28, no. 1 (2001): 153–94. 47. To be clear: I am not proposing generally valid definitions of race and ethnic- ity, but heuristic and contextual ones that allow me to distinguish what I have been calling the ethnicity of the Japanese thing from broader and more varied forms of racialization. So I here define ethnicization as a specific mode of racialization, one defined by an opposition of particular surface and universal essence. I am suggesting that it is hardly an accident that such terms and such a logic inform any number of later and quite heterogeneous discourses about Asian Americans, but a full argument for a direct, causal connection is beyond the scope of this essay. 98 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> </plain_text>
