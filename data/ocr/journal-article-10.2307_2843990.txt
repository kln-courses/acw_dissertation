<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Argument from Animnals to Men: An Examination of its Validity for Anthropology The Huxley Memorial Lecture, I956* J. B. S. HALDANE, F.R.S. IN HONOURING ME by associating my name with that of Thomas Henry Huxley, the Royal Anthropological Institute has given me the opportunity to assess the value for anthropology today of the standpoint of this great man. In Man's Place in Nature he argued not only for man's close morphological resemblance to other members of the order Primates, but for his descent from members of that order who could reasonably have been described as monkeys. His opponents in his own day of course accused him of degrading men to animals. And in his famous Romanes Lecture he went out of his way (some may think too far) to contrast the ethical process operating in humanity with the cosmic process operating in nature generally. My theme today will be the legitimacy or otherwise of arguments from what we know of animals to our own species. Such arguments are not, of course, novel. Solomon, Aesop, and the authors of the mediaeval bestiaries, who were undoubtedly influenced by the Pan- fatantra, to mention no more, used them. Above all, Plato argued from dog breeding to the possibility of human eugenics. But with the acceptance of Huxley's thesis that we are descended from non-human animal species such arguments gained in force, and it is desirable to examine them in some detail. A whole lecture could be devoted to such arguments in the field of anatomy, of physiology, of pharmacology, pathology, or psychology. But I am speaking to anthropologists. And the smattering of anthropology which I have acquired leads me to the conclusion that anthro- pologists are mainly interested in the differences between human groups, less so in the differ- ences within groups, and rather little in the characters which are common to all groups, and to almost all members of these groups. This is in no way a reproach. An anthropologist must know some anatomy, physiology, medicine, psychology, statistics, and so on. But he or she is not expected to be an expert in all these fields, even though he may be in one of them. Nor need he be an expert comparative philologist, though again, he may be. I shall therefore devote this lecture mainly to the contributions mnade by animal studies to physical anthro- pology and to cultural anthropology. I hope however that I will be forgiven if I touch very briefly on those human studies which are not the specific business of anthropologists. The gross anatomy of man is better known than that of any other animal. The microscopic and ultramicroscopic anatomny and embryology are not. If for example we want the best possible preparations of the internal ear we must kill animals by special methods and begin to fix the tissues before they are completely dead. If we want to examine nerve cells with an electron microscope we must do much the same. If we want to follow the details of an embryological process we shall be well advised to use mice or rats. In all these cases enough human material is available to justify or to rebut the argument from animal to human structure. Again, in so far as they can be studied without danger to life, human physiology, pharma- *Delivered at the Rooms of the Royal Society, Piccadilly, W.I, 29 November, I956.</page><page sequence="2">2 J. B. S. HALDANE cology, and pathology are better known than those of any other animal. Thanks particularly to my late father, we know that human physiology can be extremely accurate. Nevertheless we must often rely on animal experiments. But these seldom give us quantitative information applicable to men. The human heart will probably respond to a drug in the same way as a dog's heart, but it may be a good deal more or less responsive to an equivalent dose in milli- grams per kilogram. Still, animal experiments are very helpful in these spheres because in the last ten million years of its evolution the line ancestral to our species has not altered as much in its anatomy, physiology, and so on as some other mammalian lines, except in the physiology of the brain. The situation in psychology is very different. Human psychology is perhaps as different from that of a chimpanzee as a chimpanzee's is from a bird's. This difference is emphasized by some religions, though Hindus and Buddhists seem to me to evaluate it fairly correctly. Conversely some zoologists class every attempt to argue from human to animal psychology as anthropomorphism. In Huxley's lifetime Darwin and Romanes among others tried to trace the origin of human psychological traits in animals. So, a little later, did Freud, particularly in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. A new epoch began with Pavlov, and his approach, based on experiment, has been vigorously followed up, especially in the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. From a study of how animals alter their conduct, a process called conditioning, learning, forgetting, and so on, we can, I believe, learn a good deal about how individual human beings alter their conduct, and this has applications to human psychiatry. Nevertheless, I think that a different approach to the study of animal behaviour may ultimately be at least equally valuable to anthropologists. We are living in a wholly exceptional period, in which human adults have got to continue learning. A failure to learn the meaning of traffic signals is an offence for which the punishment may be death. But in most human cultures of the past, and in a few relict cultures which anthropologists can still study, this was not so. The culture did not change appreciably during a lifetime, and an adult did not have to alter his schedule of conduct in given circumstances. Now it is possible to study the behaviour of animals in an approximately steady state, during which, so far as we can see, they learn nothing and forget nothing. Such a study must however be statistical. Moreau's (I 939) observations on the nesting behaviour of birds, and those of Kinsey, Pomeroy &amp; Martin (I 948) on human sexual behaviour fall nearly into this class 1. Moreau measured the mean times during which swallows stayed on their nests and away from them, and their variation. He found, for example, that the periods of absence were much less variable than those of incubation. Presumably a bird feels the need to return to its eggs even if it has caught few insects, but may not feel the need to leave its eggs. This is an obvious adaptation to the need for keeping the eggs at a fairly constant temperature. A similar study of more or less rhythmical behaviour in human beings in cultures where there is no 'clocking in' is much to be desired. With these prolegomena I pass to my main topics. The differences with which physical anthropologists are concerned are in part genetically determined. HOW far they are so can only be determined from the results of geographic or social migration. Thus Suski (I933) found that the children ofJapanese origin born and bred in California were about as tall, on average, as Californian children of European descent. Mahalanobis, Majumdar &amp; Rao (I949) showed that well-to-do members of other castes resembled Brahmins in many physical characters. When all such allowances have been made it is clear that most of the differences with which physical anthropologists had concerned themselves are mainly determined genetically. A fundamental question is at once posed. Are the principles of human genetics the same as those of animal genetics? And if so was not Plato fully justified in arguing from dog breeding to 'To quote these authors (p.446): 'Exceedingly few males modify their attitudes on sex or change their patterns Qf overt behaviour in any fundamental way after their middle teens',</page><page sequence="3">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN 3 human breeding? Should not human breeding be controlled scientifically? I have tried to answer some of these questions elsewhere (Haldane I 95Gb). Perhaps more interesting to anthro- pologists are such questions as these. Are the biological differences between human groups comparable with those between groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and bulldogs, or between related species or subspecies living in different areas or habitats, such as wolves and jackals ? I have no doubt that the fundamental principles of genetics, discovered largely by Mendel, and first applied to men by Bateson and Garrod, are valid for men, as they are for animals and plants. But the applications of these principles to men and the animals so far studied are very different, perhaps as different as the application of the fundamental principles of chemistry to iron and to wood. Let us try to see some reasons why this is so. There are several different reasons. Most work on animal genetics has been done on domesticated animals. Since Drosophila melanogaster has 30 or 40 generations a year it has been bred under human control for about as many generations as the cow, and must be regarded as domesticated. Now one of the first things which anthropologists investigate in a culture is its mating system: who has children by whom. The mating system of domestic animals is quite peculiar. In most domestic species there is a number of strictly endogamous breeds. The parents of a member of the breed must be members of the same breed. An Aberdeen Angus can no more become a Jersey on account of her meritorious milk yield than a sudra can become a brahmin by learning or asceticism. We might expect that the Indian castes would differ as much inter se as breeds of domestic animals. So perhaps they might but for one fundamental fact. The children of brahmins who could not learn the Vedas were not drowned, castrated, or even demoted to a lower caste. But is is only by such methods as these that the characters of animal breeds are preserved. The same applies to social classes in other societies. Individuals from lower classes may enter a higher one by intelligence, valour, or beauty. But human beings commonly look after the interests of their children, even if they do not resemble their parents. Hence much of the effort of members of a ruling class is devoted to finding niches within it for those of their children who do not possess the characters needed to enter it from below. Were it not for this fact humanity might by now have divided into several subspecies corresponding to social classes, and aristocracy would be the only possible form of government. We might however expect that the inheritance of physical characters such as hair and eye colour within a polymorphic race such as Western Europeans would be as simple as it is in mice or poultry. There is a good reason why this is not so. A white hen appears by mutation in a previously black breed. It may be eaten. Or its descendants may be mated together to form a new white breed. It is therefore usually found that the genetical basis of white plumage in all members of a breed is the same. But nothing comparable occurs in our own species. Blue eye colour is, on the whole, recessive to brown. But there are enough well-authenticated cases of brown-eyed children of blue-eyed parents to show that several different gene substitu- tions may determine the development of blue rather than brown eyes. However, Spurway (I953b) found that many of the taxonomic differences between geo- graphical subspecies of the newt Triturus cristatus were due to single gene differences. We might have hopcd that the colour differences between Europeans and West Africans would have been as simply based, though this would seem a priori improbable to an anthropologist who considered the almost continuous cline of skin colour found as we travel overland from Ukraine to Nigeria. In fact the colour difference in question has not been analysed genetically. It appears to depend on a number of gene pairs. The analysis will become possible as, on the one hand increasing racial equality makes for unions where paternity is neither doubtful nor likely to be concealed, and on the other, biochemical work such as that of Rothman, Krysa &amp; Smiljanic (I946) and of Kikkawa, Ogita &amp; Fujito (I955; see also Kikkawa I956)</page><page sequence="4">4 J. B. S. HALDANE opens up the possibility of distinguishing, by biochemical methods, between genes with similar effects on pigmentation. But meanwhile genetics has made little contribution to physical anthropology as our grandparents understood it. The reason is, I believe, simple. Domestic animals are the product of artificial selection, combined with intense inbreeding. The newts in a river basin, as Spurway (I 95 3b) has argued on cytological grounds, may all be descended from the first fertilized female to cross a watershed into it. Perhaps in palaeolithic times human tribes were so endogamous that one could have argued from the genetics of domestic animals, had they existed, to that of men. Today the human mating system is more like that of moderately mobile mammals such as field voles. Since their genetics have not been studied, we cannot argue from it to human genetics. At this point it may be worth saying a few words on animal mating systems. They may be utterly different in nearly related species. Thus in the mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos a brood disperses in its first year, and its members may breed hundreds or thousands of miles apart. This species is not divided into local races or subspecies. But young geese of the genera Anser and Branta normally migrate with their parents. There are local races with colour dif- ferences which have been given sub-specific rank, e.g. Anser caerulescens caerulescens and A. c. hyperboreus, the blue and lesser snow geese, the latter of which is almost white. Their breeding areas are adjacent but probably do not overlap. Lorenz (I943a) has claimed that wild geese brought up together will not mate, the brother-sister relationship inhibiting sexual attraction. This observation seems to need confirmation. If confirmed it is clearly of great interest for anthropologists. If genetics has done little for classical anthropology it has revealed a wholly new and un- expected set of anthropological characters, the antigens and haemoglobins of the red corpus- cles, whose genetic determination is very simple. As a reader of Mourant's (I954) book can readily verify, their geographical distribution is not. What is worse, no such character sharply differentiates two populations, as skin colour or hair structure may. It is nevertheless true that some antigens, or combinations of antigens, are rare and probably absent in some populations, and very common in others. Thus the Henshaw, Hunter, and Diego antigens have not been found in Europeans, but the first two are common in West Africans, the latter in South Ameri- can Amerindians. These antigens seem to have very little adaptive value, and just for this reason are particularly valuable as an index of racial origins. Whereas the fact that skin cancer in Bombay is almost confined to Europeans leaves little doubt of the adaptive value of skin pigmentation, and the work of Schreider (I950) is making it more and more probable that many metrical characters are adaptations to climate. Thus we cannot argue that the very dark pigmentation of African negroes and Melanesians indicates common ancestry. However, from the absence of a very dark indigenous race in tropical America we can suggest that the evolution of such a race requires over io,ooo years, and that the ancestors of negroes and Melanesians have mainly lived in the tropics for more than that time. There is no reason to think that our knowledge of the erythrocyte antigens is anywhere near complete. But if it were so, we know that there are many other antigens found in cells of other types, of which we know nothing in man, except that, they differ so much as to render organ grafts impossible. We know a good deal about them and their genetics in mice. It is safe to prophesy that if biology exists fifty years hence they will have provided us with anthro- pological data of the greatest importance. Recent work (Layresse &amp; Arends I956; Lewis, Ayukawa &amp; Chown I956) which shows that the Diego antigen, commonest in South American Amerindians, is also found in I0 per cent of Chippewas in North America, and of Japanese, and 5 per cent of a smaller sample of south Chinese, fully confirms the usual theory of the derivation of the Amerinclians, A search for this antigen among Polynesians and Eskimos</page><page sequence="5">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN 5 will be rewarding. The discovery that the Basques and the Swiss of the Canton of Wallis, with their excess of the d antigen, can be considered as representatives of a proto-European stock, is an example of what we may hope for. I shall speak later of the abnormnal haemoglobins. In recent years Plato's argument from dogs to men has been expanded into the statement, both by zoologists such as Lorenz (I934b) and by anthropologists such as Mead (I954), that man, and civilized man in particular, is a domestic animal. From this premise Lorenz (p. 502) pro- ceeded to argue that civilized peoples must inevitably perish 'unless selfconscious, scientifi- cally based race politics prevents it' (p.302). Such politics are based on 'the value of racial purity' (p. 3 I I), 'the function of the intolerant value-judgment' (p.308), and other tenets of the National Sozialistische Arbeiter Partei. I believe that the statement that man is a domestic animal is almost wholly false. Let us see where it is correct. Civilized men, like domestic animals, are sheltered from the predation of other vertebrate species. They are sheltered from some violent natural forces such as storms and frosts, though more liable than houseless men to be killed by earthquakes. They are, or were till very recently, particularly liable to be killed by infectious diseases promoted by overcrowding. Their food is relatively soft. As against this, domestic animals, with rare exceptions such as reindeers, cats, and bees, are divided into endogamous groups, the differences between which have been produced and are maintained by artificial selec- tion. They have in consequence become highly specialized, and have usually lost many of the characters of their wild ancestors. From a purely animal point of view, man is unspecialized in many important ways. No other animal can swim a mile, walk twenty miles, and then climb forty feet up a tree. Many civilized men can do this without much difficulty. If so it is rather silly to regard them as physically degenerate. It is characteristic of Lorenz' argument (p.303) that beside the picture of a wolf he gives that of a bulldog with the caption 'Reduction of the locomotory organs in the domestic form'. He was not, perhaps, aware of the existence of borzois and Irish wolf-hounds, which run quicker than wolves; nor had it yet been revealed to him that dogs are mainly descended from jackals. Perhaps the greatest difference between men and domestic animals is a very simple one. The wild ancestors of every domesticated land vertebrate have been at least somewhat social, and their tame descendants exhibit to men some at least of the patterns of behaviour which the wild ancestors exhibited to members of their own species. But as the result of domestica- tion they have ceased to a greater or less extent to communicate with members of their oWn species (Spurway I955). In particular, with the abolition of mating choice, sexual communi- cation, including the activities called courtship, has atrophied or been grossly simplified (Lorenz I 940). A few domestic animals, such as sheepdogs, understand some human commnuni- cations, but even these communicate less with their own species than did their wild ancestors. Whereas man has hypertrophied communication. He speaks, writes, gesticulates, draws, performs rituals, and so forth. The religions of others - not of course our own - can even be described in the language of comparative ethology (Lorenz I950) as vacuum activities of communication in which human beings communicate with non-existent hearers. Biologists generally accept Huxley's thesis that man has evolved. But the evolution of our ancestors in the last few million years has been of an unusual kind, involving a consider- able increase in the volumes of some parts of the brain. It is difficult to answer the question, 'Has man evolved more rapidly or more slowly than the average mammalian species?' Of course this question can only be answered on the morphological level. I shall try to answer it provisionally on this level. At first sight one would undoubtedly answer 'Yes'. The forms described as Pithecanthropus, Sinanthropus, Atlanthropus, and Meganthropus probably lived less than a million years ago. Indeed, recent work suggests that the Pleistocene period only lasted for about 300,000 years. The South African Australopithecines are not very much, if at all, older. It is not yet sure that our ancestors belonged to any of these genera, but some cannot</page><page sequence="6">6 J. B. S. HALDANE be far off our ancestral line. If we accept the validity of the generic distinctions, it would appear that a genus of the Hominidae has a mean life of less than a million years. This would be very rapid evolution. Simpson (I944) finds the mean life of the genus of Carnivora to be about eight million years, and in many other groups it is much longer. But I think the generic distinctions are very doubtful. We have overclassified the Primates. Mayr (I95I), who is one of the world's leading taxonomists, may have gone too far in the other direction when he suggested that the genus Homo should consist of three species, sapiens including the subspecies neanderthalensis and soloensis, erectus including Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus, and transvaalensis including the Australopithecines. I should personally incline to put some at least of the latter in separate genera. But if Mayr's view is anywhere near correct, human evolution has not been very rapid on a taxonomic basis. Some years ago I introduced (Haldane I94gb) a more quantitative measure of evolu- tionary rate. I defined the unit, a darwin, as the increase or decrease in the mean dimension of a structure by a factor of e per million years, or what comes to the same thing, by a factor of i *OOI per I,OOO years. Average rates for tooth evolution in the ancestors of the horse since the Eocene are about 40 millidarwins, and Dinosaur lengths gave similar figures. But if Sinan- thropus is in any way representative, human skull height has increased at a rate of about one darwin during the Pleistocene. The length and breadth have of course changed very little. But it appears that evolution of height has been abnormally quick. When we have adequate fossil material it will be of the greatest interest to discover whether the human hand evolved as quickly. I believe, with T. H. Huxley, that the main agent of human evolutionary change has been natural selection. The most varied views have been expressed as to how far, if at all, men are, or have been, exposed to natural selection. I shall not review them, but state my own opinions. Firstly, man, like every other species, is subject to centripetal selection which weeds out extreme variants. These variants are of two kinds genetically. On the one hand there are rare mutants such as haemophilics and microcephalics. The selection approximately balances the mutation rate. On the other hand where the heterozygote for a pair of allelomorphs is fitter in the Darwinian sense than either homozygote, an equilibrium is reached where only a minority of the population is of the most favoured genotype. Penrose (I955b) has developed this notion in some detail. Secondly mankind is subject to natural selection of the type con- sidered by Darwin, producing changes in gene frequencies, with evolutionary consequences. This however is usually a slow process, and much harder to observe, let alone to measure accurately, than centripetal selection. Thirdly, as I have suggested elsewhere (Haldane I 949a) the main selective agency acting on mankind during the last few thousand years has been infectious disease. The inventions of husbandry, of agriculture, and finally of cities, greatly increased the density of populations, and hence the death rate from infectious diseases. Trade led to the exchange of pathogens between different populations. It is probable that during most of the Pleistocene period mankind was divided into smnall endogamous tribes. Sewall Wright (I949 and earlier) has produced strong a priori arguments that evolution can be very rapid in a population so divided. Keith (1948) later reached the same conclusion independently. We should expect to find very considerable physical diversity between different contemporaneous peoples, and the data assembled by Vallois (I 954) support this view; however, the fossil record of the lower and middle palaeolithic is meagre, and the artefacts suggest a considerable uniformity. It is much too early to be dogmatic. We still know too little of the biochemical basis of resistance to most diseases to say much as to their genetics, except that congenital resistance to disease appears to be specific. A person congenitally resistant to measles is not thereby rendered congenitally resistant to tuberculosis, or conversely. But we are beginning to learn something of the biochemical basis of resistance</page><page sequence="7">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN 7 to malaria, or rather to the various malarias due to different sporozoan species. In the mal- arious regions of the world large fractions of human populations have red blood corpuscles abnormal in their structure (thalassaemia minor) or in the nature of their haemoglobin (haemoglobin S, C, E, etc.). Beet (I946) was probably the first to suggest that the sickle-cell trait, or in modern terminology, haemoglobin S, conferred resistance to malaria. Allison (I954) showed that the resistance, which is not however so complete as he first believed, is only or at least mainly to Plasmodium falciparum. Haldane's (I 949c) suggestion that thalass- aemnia minor has a similar function has not been confirmed or disproved, though the geo- graphical distribution in Italy and Greece supports it. Lehmann (I956) thinks that haemo- globins D and E may give some protection against ankylostomiasis. These abnormal conditions are transmitted as dominants over the normal state of the erythrocytes, the resistant persons being heterozygous. However, in the case of thalassaemia minor and the sickle-cell trait the progeny of two heterozygotes include one quarter abnormal homozygotes who generally die young of severe anaemia. Homozygotes for C and E haemoglobins are less handicapped. In consequence the frequency of resistant heterozygotes seldom exceeds about 20 per cent, in which case about one per cent of all children die of anaemia. The gene for thalassaemia appears to be most frequent round the Mediterranean, though it extends at least to Indochina and Indonesia (Brumpt, de Traverse &amp; Coquelet I956). Haemoglobin S stretched from West Africa to the Nilgiris in Southern India, but is now found wherever African slaves were brought. Haemoglobin C seems to be mainly confined to West Africa, haemoglobin D to North-western India, haemoglobin E to South-eastern Asia and Indonesia. Lehmann (I956) gives the latest data. Once such a gene is present in a population it will spread if the appropriate malarial parasite gives it an advantage, until its further spread is checked by its lethal effect when homozygous. But since haemoglobin C is almost confined to West Africa, though it would be advantageous in East Africa, while haemoglobin E stretches from Indonesia to Ceylon, but has not been found in Africa, and thalassaemia is at least rare south of the Sahara, it is probable that such genes arise very rarely indeed by mutation, less than once in a thousand million gametes, as compared to about once in fifty thousand for the more mutable human loci. If so Lehmann and his colleagues (cf. Lehmann I953) are justified in drawing conclusions as to racial origins from the presence of haemoglobin S in Southern India and Arabia as well as in Africa. I shall not develop this topic further, but I think the time has come when a discussion of such matters between anthropological geneticists and animal geneticists like myself who have studied mutation and selection might achieve unanimity on the validity of arguments of this kind. It is reasonable to hope that within some of our life-times infectious diseases will become sufficiently rare to be unimportant as agents of selection. If so a chapter in human evolution will close. The abnormal haemoglobins will slowly disappear. So probably will a number of other characters which are only advantageous in presence of specific infective agents. As Penrose (I955a) has pointed out, hygiene is more likely to have a eugenic effect than the dysgenic one usually attributed to it. No doubt however it will have a dysgenic effect as regards non-infectious but at least partly hereditary diseases such as diabetes. We do not know what will be the main agents of natural selection among our descendants. In certain circumstances resistance to high-frequency radiation will become as important as was resistance to disease in the past. There is unfortunately no reason to believe that exceptional men, if such there be, who can survive a dose of IOOO roentgens are any more desirable in other respects than those who recover from plague. I must now pass to the topic of cultural anthropology. The diversity of human behaviour depends both on innate differences and on differences of culture, There are presumably</page><page sequence="8">8 J. B. S. HALDANE differences in the median innate capacities of human groups for various forms of achievement. But the differences between members of a group are much greater than the differences between group medians. Hence environment, and particularly tradition, are more important than innate differences in determining the differences between human cultures. The study of animal tradition is therefore important to anthropologists. Unfortunately the statements made about it by some distinguished anthropologists seem to me to be inaccurate. In my classification of human cultural features I shall use a Hindu classification rather than a modern European or American one for the following reason. Modern cultural anthro- pology is a by-product of colonialism. It consists of accounts given by persons almost all of European origin of the behaviour of members of other cultural groups over which they exerted dominance, largely through the greater efficiency of their weapons. Colonialism lasted for about four centuries, and is now drawing to a close. Hindu anthropology is similarly a by- product of the caste system, which is now also drawing to a close, but which lasted for over two thousand years. Soviet anthropology is a by-product of yet a third system. We do not know how long it will last, but it is not yet forty years old, and some of its tenets are taken over from Morgan's study of the Iroquois, which was a by-product of colonialism. I shall therefore employ a terminology of respectable antiquity, in the form given to it by my friend Professor Nirmal Kumar Bose in his Cultural Anthropology (reprinted I953). I shall thus annoy not only British and Soviet anthropologists, but the majority of Indian ones, who may very reasonably object to a terminology associated with ideas which are a hindrance to progress in India. On the other hand I am emboldened to use the terminology of Indian cultural anthropology because some Western anthropologists ignore it completely. Pocock (I956) may be consulted as to the ignoration of recent Indian work. According to the Hindu classics, human desires can be classified according as they are concerned with artha, economic needs, kama, reproductive needs, and moksha, the need for emancipation from these other needs. Perhaps there is also a dharma concerned with beauty, sundara. A culture is characterized by various dharmas which satisfy these needs to a greater or less extent. Each dharma acts through five agencies, vastu or material object, krzya or habitual action, samhati or social grouping, vicharamulaka tattwa, namely 'knowledge based on experience and subject to criticism,' and viswasamulaka tattwa or knowledge based on faith. These interact with the svadharma of each individual, which, to some extent, corres- ponds with our notion of genotype. I do not of course suggest that this is the only Hindu classification. Some authors would deny the existence of a kamadharma. Anthropologists study all five of these agencies, and it is clear that the differences between them in different cultures are due mainly to differences of tradition, rather than of biological heredity. A human being brought up in one culture can adopt the traditions of another, though with some difficulty. Perhaps the change is easiest for those who have most nearly achieved moksha, to whom the dharma of one culture appears as devoid of absolute value as that of another. Such a person is unlikely to wear a dhoti, a kilt, or a pair of trousers with full elegance, but may be prepared to wear any of them. Does tradition exist among animals? Many animal activities are instinctive, by which I mean that many complicated social activities are performed by animals which have been brought up in isolation from members of their own species, and in particular have not per- ceived other members of it carrying out these activities. Honeybees have a language or set of symbolical movements, first interpreted by von Frisch (I950 and earlier), which enable them to communicate the distance of a food source with considerable accuracy, and its direc- tion rather more accurately than a man can do by such words as 'Northeast by east' (Haldane &amp; Spurway I 954). This communication is both made and understood without learning, though Lindauer (I95I, I953) has shown that bees often misinterpret their first instructions</page><page sequence="9">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN 9 for a flight, and usually exaggerate the distance when first reporting a discovery of food. We shall learn little from insects as to the transmission of culture, though we can learn some- thing. But culture is certainly transmitted in birds and mammals. Von Pernau (I702) and Barrington (I773) founded cultural ornithology, but little further progress was made before the work of the Heinroths (I924-6) and Promptov (e.g. I949) in this century. It is now being vigorously prosecuted byThorpe (I 95 I, I 954) and his colleagues in England. These investigations have mainly been concerned with vocal, or linguistic tradition. In some species, for example the blackbird, Turdus merula, there is apparently no tradition. Males brought up by human beings from the egg sing a perfect song. This represents a human aspiration. Several mythical personages were born with a knowledge of the Vedas. But I wish to suggest that it mnay once have been a human reality. During the lower palaeolithic period, techniques of flint chipping continued with very little change for periods of over i OO,OOO years. It seems to me possible that they may have been as instinctive as the making of spiders' webs, even if most flint chippers saw other men chipping flints. To assume that these techniques were learned seems to me an anthropomorphic interpretation of beings who were hardly quite human. The contrary assumption is of course equally temerarious. In my opinion we do not know. Other birds such as the skylark (Alauda arvensis) and chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) must learn their song. Reared in isolation the lark's song is said to be unrecognizable, that of the chaffinch very imperfect. Marler (I952) found that within Great Britain he could recognize five local chaffinch dialects, with considerable overlap, and considerable variation within a given area. But the chaffinches of the Azores sing a dialect differing from any of the British dialects far more than they differ from one another. We can ask what are the conditions for the development of a local dialect given that young song-birds disperse widely during their first year, whereas in later years they generally return to the same area to nest, even if they have migrated southwards in autumn. The answer is not quite obvious. The song must of course be learned. If it were determined genetically local dialects within a country of the size of England would be no more possible than local colour varieties. And the song must not be learned by nestlings from their father, as it is in robins (Erithacus rubecula). Such learning has the same observable effects as one type of biological inheritance. The condition for the formation of local dialects is that male birds should learn the song from neighbouring males at the end of their first year, when they are already attached to particular localities. I have dealt with this case in some detail because the conditions for the development of local cultures differ from one species to another, and a consideration of them may at least give anthropologists a background. In our own species unduly precocious learning is probably inimical to culture. No doubt we learn some very important things from our mothers, but we learn still more important ones from society, and many cultures mark the transition from one type of learning to the other by special rites, which are fortunately not required by chaffinches. Now let me go back to Bose's classification. Do social animals transmit vastu (material objects) from one generation to another? Most certainly. The most striking example is the transmission by females (queens) of the agricultural ant genus Atta of pieces of the fungus Rhozites which they cultivate. Each piece is carried in a special cavity near the mouth and deposited in the new fungus garden. The analogy with seeds in human cultures is obvious. The immense emotional valence of plant seeds for men is shown by the fact that the word for them in many languages also designates the male reproductive fluid. This is so in a variety of Aryan and Semitic languages, in Magyar (where it is also a reflexive pronoun), and also in Mundari, though Professor Bose tells me that in Mundari the word also means acculturation,</page><page sequence="10">IO J. B. S. HALDANE a custom being described as 'Hindu seed', or 'English seed'. But as might be expected, this equivalence is absent in Fulani, the language of a pastoral people. Sanskrit has two other official words for the reproductive fluid, and many languages have unofficial words. A world- wide study on this topic would be worth while, unless indeed I am displaying my ignorance and it has already been made. Do animals use material objects for communication? They do so both to communicate with other members of their species, and with themselves in the future, as men use writing for both purposes. Hediger (I955) in a book which every cultural anthropologist should read, though its title hardly suggests its relevance, gives surprising but probably true answers to two questions: 'In what way do men most resemble other mammals psychologically, apart from physiological needs, and in what way do they most differ?' He states (cf. Spurway I956) that they resemble them most in their sense of property, and differ most in not being chroni- cally afraid. Non-human mammals, particularly males, characteristically mark their property with their individual scent, sometimes, but by no means always, using excretions or glands near the anus for this purpose. You have only to look at a male chamois, black buck, or hyaena to see scent glands on the head. It is even possible to distinguish the marks made by individual hyaenas visually. These odours serve as a warning to other males, and a source of satisfaction to the rightful owners. Other species such as several bears and the domestic dog communi- cate by depositing odours and scratching objects outside their territories. These odours and marks are material objects whose main function is to arouse certain emotions. Such objects are of course familiar to anthropologists, though in our own species they usually act by being seen rather than smelt. The kriya or habitual action is quite often learned. Kuo's (I 938) experiments showed that cats would not generally kill mice or rats unless taught to do so by their parents. Chernomordikov (I944) found that young lizards of the genera Anguis and Eumeces only eat insect larvae if their skin has been broken, and only hunt moving insects if they have previously tasted them. Evans (I 955) describes maternal care in Fumeces, and it is probable that members of this genus are taught what to eat by their mothers. More remarkably Reyniers (I953) reported that young rats isolated from their parents die from retention of urine unless the external opening of the urethra is mechanically stimulated. After this has been done once or twice they respond to distension of the bladder. Let no psychoanalyst claim that the human species is unique in having psychological difficulties connected with infantile excretion. Some member of an animal species may invent a new kriya, and it can spread, apparently by imitation. A few years ago a Stevin or Watt among great tits (Parus major) invented the practice of opening milk bottles left on human doorsteps. This has become common in England (Fisher &amp; Hinde I949) and has now spread to Holland, whether by cultural diffusion or by independent invention we do not know. Similarly Petterson (I956) reports that greenfinches (Chloris chloris) are taking to eating immature seeds of Daphne mezereum. This had not been reported till very recently, although the opportunity has probably existed for ten thousand years or so. I need not emphasize the interest of such facts for students of human cultural change. On the other hand it is mnore doubtful that samhati, or social organization, is tradi- tional in animals. Vertebrates have to learn their functions in the society into which they are born. And the structure of this society varies with its numbers, its environments, the temperament of dominant individuals, and so on. But there is as yet little evidence that un- usual economic circumstances or unusual individuals can induce a change in social structure lasting through many generations, as they can in human societies. The best piece of evidence on this question is Elton's (I933) statement that the muzzling order of I895 by which dogs</page><page sequence="11">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN I I were prevented from biting one another for some months has permanently lowered the acerbity of fights between British dogs. It would perhaps be rash to build too large a theoretical superstructure on this foundation. The question of a traditional tattwa, or knowledge, in animals is difficult, because we can only infer knowledge from habitual actions. But there is an analogy with the two types in Bose's classification. A bird on first leaving the nest where it was hatched already knows that some objects, which it has seen, such as caterpillars or seeds, are edible, while others, such as sticks, are not. This knowledge is however subject to critical revision. De Ruiter (I 953) showed that birds can very rapidly learn that stick-like caterpillars are edible, and most vertebrates can be taught (or 'conditioned') to avoid food with particular visual or odorous characters. We do not know whether some kinds of infantile learning in vertebrates are as difficultly effaceable as moral and religious notions learned from the mother are in some human beings. But this seems to be so in insects. Thorpe (I938) made the remarkable discovery of larval conditioning, where there is no question of even such elementary teaching as the offering of a caterpillar to a nestling. Female insects of several species which have spent their larval life eating food with a particular odour will search for food of this odour in which to lay their eggs. It is doubtful whether adult learning can overcome this larval conditioning, which can be compared with viswasamalaka tattwa. In such species the choice of food plants and animals is to some extent traditional, and Thorpe was able to alter the tradition. Where such experiments have not been done, egg-laying preference is generally thought to be instinctive, as no doubt it is in some cases. If we speak of an insect knowing where to lay her eggs as the result of experience, we can also speak of instinctive knowledge, or in deference to philosophers who think that know- ledge cannot err, instinctive opinion. Such knowledge or opinion exists in our own species. Every baby 'knows' that sweet things are good to eat. This 'knowledge' may of course be erroneous, as when a child poisons itself with lead acetate. But the scope of human instinctive knowledge is limited, and we feel the lack of it. Free will is a hard burden to bear. We try to lighten it with knowledge based on faith. We know, according to the culture in which we have been brought up, either that the eating of human flesh is an abomination, or that it is necessary for the acquisition of certain qualities. We also claim to know the truth of some most detailed and complicated assertions about the structure of the universe, its past and its future. It is not known whether human societies can exist without traditional viswasamulaka tattwa. They can certainly exist with very different and mutally contradictory ones, and the 'knowledge' acquired in this way need not include supernatural elements. It can however be argued that beliefs in the rightness and wrongness of certain actions, held without rational foundations, are essential for the stability of any human society. I shall come back later to the question whether any elements in such beliefs are not of traditional origin. Returning once more to Bose's classification, a few animals, such as bower birds, show sundaradharma, behaviour satisfying aesthetic needs. This is most marked in the bower birds, where Marshall (I 954) regards it as a derivati,v e, or displacement activity, of sexual behaviour, as it is in men according to some Freudians. It does not appear to be traditional. Have animals a mokshadharma ? So far as I know this question has not been asked. It is too seldom asked concern- ing human cultures. Moksha means the state of a human being unaffected by external stimuli such as heat and cold, or internal stimuli (Pavlov I928) such as those causing hunger and lust. It has a special theological significance for Hinduism, but it can be equated with the di7apacia of Epicurus, and the contemplative life of Christian mystics. I do not doubt that some at least of the primitive religions help their adherents towards it, but is is perhaps the hardest function of a religion for field anthropologists to investigate. I think it conceivable that some higher</page><page sequence="12">I2 J. B. S. HALDANE animals can perform mokshadharma in their post-reproductive period, but there is no evidence for its cultural transmission. I hope that I have shown that we can legitimately ask the question whether the equivalent of a human social activity is found in a particular animal species, and if so how far it depends on tradition. It always depends on heredity, in the broad sense of that word. Even those songbirds which must learn their song learn the song characteristic of their own species when a choice is offered to them. The examples which I have given are few because zoologists have only recently begun to ask this question systematically, and no comprehensive review of animal tradition exists. I claim that even our very meagre knowledge furnishes a background for cultural anthropology. Perhaps anthropologists may sometimes be able to put a question more clearly if they do so in a form which would be applicable to an animal species, though I trust that they will never imitate some psychologists in thinking that such a form is obligatory. I also think that the data of animal ethology can throw some light at least on the origins of human behaviour, and above all on its extreme adaptability. Social behaviour in most mammals depends largely on odour signals. That is one reason why we understand their social behaviour less well than that of birds, which, like our own, is mainly based on visual and auditory signals. Odorous signals still have some valence for us men. But when our ancestors took to arboreal life animal odours became less important to them, and plant ones more so. They doubtless developed a set of instincts appropriate to arboreal life. They probably came down from the trees more than a million years ago, and may have gone through a more or less quadrupedal phase before a change in pelvic shape made bipedal running and the emancipation of the hands possible. The great development of the brain probably occurred quite soon after the adoption of the bipedal posture. Man did not arise with a set of instincts as detailed as those of most other vertebrates, fromn which he had to emancipate himself. Wordsworth described this human absence of instinct as 'Blank mnisgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realised'. Had our ancestors had a few million years in which to develop instincts appropriate to a bipedal mammal I doubt if they could have becomne men. If our descendants ever achieve a stable and permanent culture lasting with little change over some millions of years, they may develop instincts suited to it, and cease to be men. Our relative lack of instincts has so far enabled us to adapt ourselves to the changes which we have made and are making in our environments. We do however find traces of instinct, by which I mean in this context the release of characteristic emotions and actions by somewhat arbitrary sign-stimuli, in un- expected quarters. I am inclined to accept Jung's conclusion that human beings in different cultures independently produce similar symbols which have for them a high emotional valence and are often incorporated into religions. For reasons given elsewhere (Haldane I956a) I see no reason to adopt his theory of a collective unconscious. I give just one example, which I believe is novel. Michael Angelo's frescos in the Sistine Chapel are generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of European art. So far as I know my wife was the first to remark that the attitude of Christ in the Last Judgement is that of Siva in one of his destructive aspects. The attitude is certainly rare in Christian art, and it is most unlikely that it was copied from a Hindu original. But it evokes si;milar emotions in Christians and Hindus. And here let me return to Hediger's point that man differs from most animals in not being chronically slightly frightened. Our ancestors clearly were so as long as large carnivora were a danger. With their disappearance we have peopled the world with hobgoblins and super- natural beings whose characters inspire fear. They appear to fulfil an emotional need. It is a gross oversimplification to present the needs which are served by mythology in such words as:</page><page sequence="13">THE ARGUMENT FROM ANIMALS TO MEN I3 'This life cannot be all, they swear For how unpleasant if it were'. I suggest that man, or a great many mnen, demands an object of fear, as some animals appear to do (Spurway I953a), and that it may be better to believe in Kali, Maryamma or our adversary the Devil than to make foreign governments our principal object of fear. No doubt it would be better still to concentrate on bacteria, but a primitive emotion of this type seems too often to need an object which can be readily imagined. To conclude, I think that the study of animals may tell us a good deal about the human unconscious, and thus about irrational human behaviour. I must end up by apologizing for my subject matter and mny treatment of it. An adequate treatment would have filled several books. I hope that I may stimulate a zoologist to write a book on 'Animal Tradition'. I have inevitably been both superficial and dogmatic. I have doubtless displayed my ignorance of anthropology. But the sciences are becoming specialized, and it is of immense importance for their healthy development that contact should be preserved between them. The price of such contact is a measure of inaccuracy and superficiality. But the cost of avoiding it is even more serious. Thomas Henry Huxley was primarily an anatomist. But he was not afraid of stating his opinions on physiology, anthropology, theology, and philosophy. I should like to see professional anthropologists trespassing on the fields of other sciences, and particularly, perhaps, on the study of animal behaviour. If I have irritated some of mny audience into such a counter-attack this lecture will have been justified. REFERENCES ALLISON, A. C. I954. Notes on sickle-cell polymorphism. Ann. Eugen. I91 pp.39-57.
