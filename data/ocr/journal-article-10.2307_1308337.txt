<plain_text><page sequence="1">Commentary Beyond Conspecifics: Is Brer Rabbit Our Brother? Gordon M. Burghardt and Harold A. Herzog, Jr. Every one has heard of the dog suf- fering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the operator; this man, un- less the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge, or un- less he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life. (Darwin 1871, ch. 2; words in italics were added in the second edition, 1874). THE REVOLT AGAINST THE STATUS QUO Today, on many fronts, there is re- newed interest in our relationship with nonhuman animals. Many factors have contributed to this concern. Environ- mental and ecological awareness has drawn public attention to the near exter- mination of many species and the detri- mental effects of pollution, pesticides, and habitat destruction.

This article is a revised version of a paper entitled "Beyond Conspecifics: Ethology and Animal Rights," read at the June 1979 meeting of the Animal Behavior Society at Tulane University.

The widespread questioning of government support for basic research has been intertwined with suspicions about the use and worth of any studies on animals, even those pur- porting to help understand human medi- cal and behavioral problems. New evi- dence of higher cognitive faculties in some animals including reason, lan- guage, and emotional sensitivity have resonated throughout the scientific and lay press (e.g., Gallup 1977, Lawick Goodall 1971, Griffin 1976, Lilly 1975). Ethological work on animal and human behavior has thus eroded the key foun- dation for the age-old rigid distinctions between human and nonhuman (see Re- gan and Singer 1976 for an excellent an- thology). The "study of the animal mind" is again fashionable (Burghardt 1978), as evidenced by the highly techni- cal contributions constituting an entire 1978 issue of The Behavioral and Brain Sciences (Vol. 1, no. 4). Philosophers, theologians, scientists, and many organi- zations are now grappling with the issues involved in our treatment of animals (e.g., Allen and Westbrook 1979, Curtis 1978, Henig 1979). We think the issues are basic ones that have serious implications for research (see Broad 1980). Furthermore, we see little consensus on them within the bio- medical, psychological, and animal be- havior communities. When Aronson's work at the American Museum of Natu- ral History on sexual behavior in cats was under serious assault (Wade 1976), differences within the scientific commu- nity itself on both the procedures used and the value of the studies prevented strong support for him. The controversy was surely a factor in the abolition of the Animal Behavior Department, of which he was the last head, by the museum au- thorities earlier this year. Similarly, Hutchinson's studies on electric shock-induced aggression in ani- mals (including monkeys and people) led to Senator Proxmire's ridicule and "Golden Fleece" award, resulting in a celebrated suit (Holden 1976) and Prox- mire's eventual public apology. Al- though the research community seems pleased with the outcome, many animal behavior researchers are clearly ambiva- lent about the scientific and ethical as- pects of this kind of work. Indeed, Ul- rich (1978), who had performed similar work in the same laboratory, published an apologetic disavowal of his efforts in this field on moral grounds. The research establishment is going to have to formu- late a thoughtful response, or it may lose the respect of a new generation of stu- dents, researchers, and politicians even when it wins in the courts. Alienation has begun: Already eminent researchers have complained to us that students, par- ticularly in Europe, are becoming "too moral." November 1980 763</page><page sequence="2">These issues are integral to a larger movement, revealed by a conference held last year at Virginia Polytechnic In- stitute and State University on "The Moral Foundations of Public Policy: Ethics and Animals." The conference brochure featured a pictorial comparison between crowded slave ships and factory farming of chickens. The Society for the Study of Ethics and Animals has just be- gun publication of a journal, Ethics and Animals, edited in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the same in- stitution. In March of this year, Bates College in Maine held a symposium on "The Ethics of the Use of Animals in Re- search." And a division of the United States Humane Society has just initiated the International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems. The announcement brochure specifically lists veterinarians, biomedical researchers, animal scien- tists, and wildlife biologists among the audiences the journal seeks to reach, and several respected scientists are involved as editors and advisers. Even the U.S. government research establishment is now concerned, as indicated in a bro- chure recently published by NIH (Anon. 1979). Although indictment of animal re- search and other uses of nonhumans is essentially moralistic, it is supported by scientific evidence. This tradition ex- tends back at least into the last century (e.g., Evans 1898), but has received new impetus in recent decades (e.g., Russell and Burch 1959), particularly the last (Carson 1972, Godlovitch et al. 1973, Morris and Fox 1978, Ruesch 1978, Ry- der 1975, Singer 1975, Smyth 1978). Ironically, radical new restrictions on work in the laboratory, zoo, and field are based in part on data derived from the very research that is being criticized. Furthermore, although the question of animal rights and human obligations is charged with emotion and sentiment, the major theoreticians do not restrict their arguments to either appeal-something that defenders of the status quo in agri- culture and research have been slow to appreciate (see e.g., Curtis 1978). In- deed, Singer (1975) claims neither to "love" animals nor to be especially in- terested in them. In sum, the goal of the "new" animal protection movement is no less than the development and accept- ance of a consistent, logical, and scien- tifically acceptable ethical treatment of animals (e.g., see the interchanges in Ethics 1978, vol.88 no.2, and Fox 1978). Throughout the ages a prime argument for kindness to animals has been the pre- vention of cruelty to other humans by humans, rather than from a concern for animals per se. Moreover, for those who suggest that people concerned with ani- mals are blind to human misery (e.g., Rensberger 1977), the first child abuse case in America could only be brought under statutes related to cruelty to ani- mals (Carson 1972). Implicitly or explicitly, many serious advocates of a new animal ethics consid- er their views to be the logical and neces- sary extension of the movement toward equality and nondiscrimination in the treatment of various human groups by one another (see also the older writings in Regan and Singer 1976). Just as aware- ness of the abuses and illogic of discrimi- nation by race, sex, and age has led to efforts on the educational, political, and economic fronts to ameliorate, if not eliminate, such discrimination, so is the struggle joined on behalf of other species to combat what is now termed "species- ism." In other words, if we are all broth- ers and sisters under the skin, deserving of equal dignity and opportunity in spite of vast differences, then do not other ani- mals, many of whom seem much closer to us than we dared to think but a few years ago, deserve equal consideration if not equal treatment (Singer 1979)? Cer- tainly they should not be flagrantly abused physically and mentally for rea- sons so apparently trivial as producing gourmet delicacies (e.g., goose pate, veal) or evaluating new cosmetics (e.g., testing the irritability of mascara on the tearless eyes of rabbits). Ethologist E. M. Banks (1979) responded to Sing- er's (1979) charges with a solid but tradi- tional reply incorporating the "don't throw out the baby with the bathwater" and the "scientists are nice people" de- fenses (see also the exchange between Bowd 1980 and Gallup and Suarez 1980). But even scientifically educated persons are increasingly unimpressed with the use or value of much research, and they may question the motives of scientists; "Half are sadists," a highly placed Har- vard Ph.D. conservationist recently told one of us. Assertions of good intentions and appeals to the "greater good" thus seem insufficient to answer the critics. Much of the debate in this area is at cross purposes, and the criterial values to which the protagonists adhere are of- ten only implicit or embedded in sophist- ry. Our analysis of the issues surround- ing animal liberation is descriptive rather than proscriptive. We hope it will sharp- en discussion rather than provide simple answers to complex questions. PARADOXES AND ETHICAL INCONSISTENCIES Our tabulation (see the box) lists 26 considerations that seem to be involved in making judgments about the accepta- bility of a given "use" of animals. These are not meant to be exhaustive, of equal significance, or incapable of being sub- divided. Interrelations among multiple criteria in an ethical judgment almost al- ways occur, and differences in people's views result from differential weighting of them. An extensive treatment is beyond the scope of this paper; here we can only allude, perhaps too casually, to some of the paradoxical situations. We do not specifically discuss the benefits of scientific research (A-5 in the tabula- tion); we know they are great but we feel equally strongly that they cannot be the only consideration taken. We have grouped the criteria into four categories: human costs or benefits, anthropo- morphism, ecology, and psychology. Human Costs or Benefits Some of the foremost conflicts involve using animals for food (A-1) and clothing (A-2). Culture influences these matters greatly, as in the acceptability of eating pigs, dogs, and shellfish. Some vegetari- ans try to make a strong moral argument although they may be wearing leather shoes and belts. Humans will even im- pose their morals on other species, as in the periodic outcries against feeding live animals to predators in captivity. Recreational use (A-4) of animals is al- so controversial. Some people oppose pet-keeping, zoos, circus acts, rodeos, and horse racing, but fighting brings out the greatest conflicts. Throughout urban areas of the United States, cockfighting is often condemned as brutal, painful bloodletting, yet it is widespread throughout the world. Bullfighting is also a source of ire. Bear baiting was a North- ern European preoccupation that dis- appeared along with the bears. Man fighting (e.g., boxing) unlike cockfight- ing, which it resembles in many ways (e.g., rounds, referees, conditioning, diet, and weigh-ins), is often considered a noble manly sport, as the status of Mu- hammed Ali and "Rocky" still indicate. In fact, cockfighting is instructive here, as cockfighters have a series of ethical rationalizations not any less sophisti- cated and often more complex than those of their opponents (Herzog and Cheek 1979, McCaghy and Neal 1974). There is always controversy over hunting, trapping, and fishing. Many will BioScience Vol. 30 No. 11 764</page><page sequence="3">B: ANTHROPO- MORPHISM 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. pain and suffering goriness phylogenetic simi- larity humanoid appear- ance mental similarity cuteness size longevity disgusting habits accept these sports if the animal is eaten (A-1); trapping wild animals for furs (clothing, A-2) seems less acceptable, perhaps because substitutes are readily available and lingering suffering of the animals may occur. Labeling a species a "pest" (A-6) of- ten removes much of the stigma from killing it ("pest control"). We suspect that few of those who protest research on animals have moral doubts about treating their homes for termites and rats, slapping mosquitos, pulling off ticks, or using a flea collar on a dog. The argument that poison control (as in strychnine baits) is bad only because it injures nontarget organisms (e.g., people and "good" animals such as pets, song- birds, eagles, and fish) rather than the "bad" targets (e.g., insects, coyotes, and rats) makes the point clear. "Biolog- ical" control in pest management really means more precise killing or, at the least, interference with reproduction. Size (B-7) enters into the labeling pro- cess. Small animals are easier to label as pests, and less protest is usually found in the control of "vermin" such as lice, in- testinal parasites, and small rodents. Larger animals ("varmints" such as coy- otes, prairie dogs, beaver) are more con- troversial, often interfering with human resources. Another overlapping category includes species that can pose an actual physical danger to humans (A-7), such as poisonous snakes, sharks, some spiders, grizzly bears, and disease-bearing ani- mals of whatever size. Here deep-seated nonintellectual fears are most certainly at work. Furthermore, different human groups often have different interests in labeling certain species as pests. For example, Japanese fishermen kill dolphins as pests because they become entangled in and C: ECOLOGY 1. rarity 2. diversity 3. ecological balance D: PSYCHOLOGY 1. habituation 2. aesthetics 3. spiritual and religious 4. call of the wild 5. individual vari- ability 6. behavioral plas- ticity destroy nets as well as compete for in- creasingly scarce fish, whereas many conservationists believe that dolphins should be respected as an advanced life form. Similarly, the controversies be- tween ranchers and conservationists over such animals as mustangs, coyotes, and eagles involve competing interests, as do conflicts involving animals that generally invoke good feelings, such as birds. Some people are outraged by attempts to decrease numbers of very common, often alien, species such as "blackbirds" and pigeons (food compet- itors and disease vectors, respectively). Animals that have been domesticated by humans (A-8) for specific purposes seem to fall under a separate category from "wild animals." The eating of a beef-burger necessitates the slaughter of a cow; yet the killing of a cow and the shooting of a deer are not psychological- ly equivalent operations, although both involve the exploitation of an animal for human consumption. The use of domes- ticated animals is often justified because they "were created for human use" or "wouldn't exist without us." Moreover, the general public's unfamiliarity with in- tensive farming and slaughterhouse tech- niques keeps most guilt and concern suppressed. Domesticated animals used for re- search (A-5) rather than for food or clothing are in yet another category. However, all lab animals, even among mammals, are not considered morally equivalent, such as shown by the outcry over the use of beagles in U.S. Army chemical warfare experiments or over Aronson's use of cats (not rats) in his sex research at the American Museum. The beagle and cat flaps show that what re- searchers and others forget is that some domesticated animals can be exploited November 1980 only for certain ends (e.g., as pets). But it is not enough to think that it is always acceptable to use an animal for the pur- pose for which it was domesticated. Most people in U.S. society are against cockfighting, even though the roosters have been selectively bred for that pur- pose. And a small but vocal group is pro- testing many traditional ways of using domestic food animals. Thus, domes- tication is far from a straightforward con- sideration and raises some of the most disturbing issues. Anthropomorphism Hunting, trapping, and fishing can in- troduce the factor-discussed for years by moralists and philosophers-that is still the major preoccupation of current theoreticians and animal welfare activ- ists. Killing or otherwise using animals is often considered acceptable only if care is taken to reduce suffering (B-1). Some- times researchers are needlessly in- sensitive and cruel (see, e.g., Diner 1979, Ruesch 1978); the problem is where to draw the line. Fishermen often draw it between their prey and those of other game hunters. Singer (1975), the animal liberation guru, will eat oysters but noth- ing "higher" because he believes such animals feel pain, while oysters don't. The element of anthropomorphism is ob- vious: How many people would eat raw-that is, live-oysters if they screamed or whimpered at one's first bite? In actuality, much of the concern ex- pressed in terms of the pain and suffering experienced by an animal is more accu- rately viewed in terms of its assault on the sensibilities of the human observer. Thus, "goriness" (B-2)-spilled blood- as perceived by people is, in our view, a more relevant factor than "pain." Cer- tainly, attacks on medical research even short of vivisection make ample use of the often nauseating procedures em- ployed. Comparisons with Nazi pseudo- science carried out on concentration camp inmates are not uncommon (e.g., Ruesch 1978). Similarly, Bekoff (1976) points out the visual bias we employ in ethical responses to animal research. What if oysters had red blood? The consideration of human sensi- bilities leads to the concerns that are most important in our essentially gut-lev- el evaluations of whether a given use of an animal is right, proper, or necessary. As with the acceptability of various food items, cultural factors often mediate eth- ical judgment, but we think some deeply 765 Considerations Entering into Ethical Evaluation of Relations with Other Species A: HUMAN BENEFIT 1. food 2. clothing 3. transportation 4. recreation 5. research 6. pests and com- petitors 7. danger and disease 8. domestication</page><page sequence="4">ingrained biological mechanisms are also operative. Phylogenetic and morphological simi- larities (B-3 and B-4) are clearly impor- tant, as indicated by our interest in non- human primates and the great apes. Many primatologists view their clientele as behaviorally far closer to humans than to other mammals; circus trainers and their audiences share this view. The evo- lutionary relatedness of primates to hu- mans often does make them the most ap- propriate nonhuman animals for use in medical research. This leads to intense conflicts. The International Primate Pro- tection League (P.O. Drawer X, Sum- merville, SC 29483) has arisen to counter demands of the medical and defense re- search establishments for more wild pri- mates, and its newsletter has docu- mented considerable evasion of laws and humane standards in the unseemly, des- perate means used by governmental agencies and established scientists to procure wild primates. Even behavioral workers have been caught in this con- flict, for the critics of primate research equate the production of mentally dis- turbed abnormal monkeys (e.g., by so- cial deprivation) with actual physiologi- cal intervention in medical laboratories. The concern for whales and porpoises (mental similarity, B-5) is obviously not based on a structural similarity to hu- mans since their large brain is unseen. Yet popular sentiment and action clearly favors the Cetacea as deserving of better treatment than sharks, their structural analogues (e.g., "Flipper" vs. "Jaws," the outrage over whaling, and the dashed hopes for conversations with dolphins). Paradoxically, sharks have enormous brains compared to other fish. The size (B-7) of an animal also signifi- cantly affects human responses to it. Consider small animals such as insects. Each day we may step on hundreds of ants or find many bugs squashed on our windshields. How many persons feel sorrow, remorse, or revulsion at killing these animals? How many empathize with a writhing poisoned cockroach or feel that a sentient being is being slaugh- tered? If ants or bees were as big as dogs, we might react differently. In short, large animals are more respected. The honey bee, however, has been shown by von Frisch (1966) to have "language"-a complex symbolic com- munication ability apparently unique in the animal kingdom outside of ourselves. Griffin (1976) has ably argued the impli- cation of such findings for our evaluation of animal mentality. But there is consid- erable prejudice against allowing such a tiny animal this ability or considering the implications seriously. Larger animals usually live longer than related smaller species, but longevity (B-8) seems a con- sideration in itself, albeit a minor one, that favors those that live a long time. Beautiful animals are valued over "ug- ly" ones (D-1), although beauty as an at- tribute of animals is not agreed upon by everyone. Apparently it is not just a mat- ter of individual preference (the "beauty in the eye of the beholder" view), since most people would probably rank a but- terfly above a cockroach. However, anthropomorphism plays another role here since many baby ani- mals, particularly mammals, have an ap- peal separable from that based on aes- thetics (D-2). Newborn or juvenile animals frequently share features that are the constituents of the almost univer- sal "cuteness" response (B-6). Lorenz (1943) listed the facial characteristics that make baby animals irresistible to adults, such as foreshortened snout, large eyes, high forehead, and rounded features. As these characters are also possessed by human babies, the re- sponse to young of other species (and an- imal cartoons, Gould 1979) is clearly one of generalization. Again, an irrational process is at work. A recurring example of the effectiveness of this factor is the outrage expressed at the baby harp seal clubbing on arctic ice floes each year. Opponents of such killing invariably use photographs of irresistible baby seals in their propaganda. Our culturally based anthropocentric notions of decent behavior (B-9) fre- quently color our judgments, often erro- neously, as with pigs, rats, vultures, hyenas, and certain predators. Positive attitudes may be similarly misplaced. Ecology We assign to individuals of an endan- gered species more intrinsic worth than common ones. One can make a rational case for this, but rarity is seldom suf- ficient. Many endangered species enthu- siasts were uninterested in, and some were opposed to, saving the beautiful fish that news reports always character- ized as the "3 inch snail darter." Did its small size and lack of recreational value outweigh its other qualities and value as a life form to many "dedicated con- servationists?" On the other hand, rarity is a potent factor in discussions of whal- ing or capture of wild chimpanzees for research (e.g., hepatitis vaccine produc- tion, Wade 1978). But rarity and all other considerations become secondary when just a few human lives (e.g., chimps and hepatitis) or cultural survival (e.g., Eski- mos and bowhead whales, Bockstoce 1980, Morgan 1979) are at stake. Even Scheffer (1974), a member of the board of trustees of the new Scientists Center for Animal Welfare (P.O. Box 3755, Washington, DC 20097), feels that hu- mans should always take precedence when rights collide: As a biologist, I believe that, where one must be sacrificed for the other, the animal has to go. Though man, too, is an animal, he is the only one for which important further evolution is open. He is the only one that can plan, and therefore the only one that can take action to preserve that richness. (Scheffer 1974, p. 215) But with billions of people extant and their numbers increasing, the second half of Scheffer's statement means, in effect, that we cannot escape balancing the sur- vival of wild chimpanzees, African ele- phants, or West Indian iguanas against human numbers or human comfort. The relevance of the other two ecolog- ical criteria, diversity (C-2) and ecologi- cal balance (C-3), should be readily ap- preciated, although they are seldom invoked by the general public. Psychology The closely related phenomena of hab- ituation (D-1), familiarity, and desensi- tization are of great import in setting val- ues. Children raised on farms are generally far more accepting of the slaughter of animals for food than urban children. Many scientists who cringed at their first dissection or "sacrifice" of a lab animal but soon learned to be un- sentimental are now criticized as being callous, insensitive, and imbued with their own self-importance. Other psychological criteria seem to favor animals that are variable in their behavior or morphology (D-5), or those that show greater plasticity and adapt- ability ("intelligence") (D-6). Anthropo- morphic filters are involved here. Simi- larly, religious reasons (D-3) often justify our treatment of nonhumans, both pro (Linzey 1976) and con (Regan and Singer 1976). A "call of the wild" (D-4)-in- creasingly common among the middle class faced with a jaded, sterile, urban future-has been countered by Rensber- ger (1977) in an angry polemic that points out some of the paradoxes and anthropo- morphisms involved. BioScience Vol. 30 No. 11 766</page><page sequence="5">IS A RESOLUTION POSSIBLE? Several of the 26 considerations and their many manifestations are usually in- volved in the determination of the value, worth, and ethical stance in the use of animals for any purpose, thus providing the peculiar difficulties faced by the ethi- cists. The considerations conflict with and compound each other. For instance, cockfighters often use artificial gaffs of steel to replace the natural spurs of their chickens; but Panamanians use the shell of the endangered hawksbill turtle (per- sonal observations). We suspect that currently it is impos- sible to derive from science, theology, philosophy, or any conceivable source a consistent, universal set of principles to guide humans in dealing with members of other species. But then, no ethical system has been universally accepted for our dealings with conspecifics. And in- terspecific ethical problems are qualita- tively different. There are too many com- peting biological and economic factors involved, and, more significantly, psy- chological demands often preclude ratio- nal resolution of the issues. Some of our decisions are based on irrational but of- ten understandable preferences (e.g., cuteness: baby features). That there are serious difficulties in simple or sophisticated extensions of ar- guments extending "human rights" to other animals does not invalidate the rec- ognition that immense and largely unnec- essary mistreatment of other animals is occurring worldwide and especially in modern technological societies. Con- structive approaches are possible (e.g., Kilgour 1978) and should be aggressively applied. Perhaps the best we can do is to assign numbers to the various costs and bene- fits involved for given types of animal ex- ploitation and misery, as we attempt to do when we weigh the amount of human death and environmental degradation that is "justified" by the benefits caused by high levels of air pollution, energy consumption, and so on, and then allow the "democratic process" to determine acceptable usage. This culture-bound ap- proach may be the only path to follow, and the extensive surveys by Kellert (1980) can lead the way. It may be neces- sary, but many will find this prospect depressing. Are not, some may argue, "moral calculus" games that would have values determined by polls and computer simulations of costs and benefits absurd? Can we weigh the pain suffered by a hooked fish or measure degrees of free- dom for a wolf? Is it all just a matter of whose ox is gored? In any event, biological and behavioral research will surely be affected by the outcome. As scientists, we must edu- cate, articulate, and lobby for our points of view. We must not discredit ourselves by ignoring, in self-interest, the ground- ing of "animal rights" in an evolutionary continuity among all living things, while using the same continuity to justify our research. We need to develop an "ethological ethics" divorced from the self-serving apologetics and ad hominem counter- attacks so often typical of agribusiness, drug, and cosmetic companies, the "anything is justified to save one human life" emotionalism too often found in medical circles, and the ignorance of be- havioral needs of animals found even in veterinarians and animal care specialists (e.g., Anchel 1976). Rhetoric is often cheap, simplistic, often irrational, and a cover for not thinking through complex issues that strike deep at who we are and how we live. Reread our opening quota- tion. It may or may not be comforting to know that Darwin later hedged on his ini- tial and sometimes more correct ideas. All of us should personally address the difficult challenge of "Brer Rabbit"- both as scientists and as human beings.

EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS QUALIFIED IN THE LIFE SCIENCES are published every two weeks in our newsletter, Federal Jobs in the Life Sciences. FJLS in- forms you of the many job opportunities available with the Federal government in your field, equips you to apply effec- tively, counsels on how to fill out your application forms, and gives up-to-date information on government developments which affect Federal hiring practices. For more information write: Federal Jobs in the Life Sciences P.O. Box 14059 Washington, D.C. 20044 Information for Contributors * Correspondence: All correspondence should be directed to BioScience, American Institute of Biological Sciences, 1401 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209. * Editorial Policy: The editors welcome manuscripts on all biological or biologically re- lated subjects, but they urge authors in specialized areas to use language under- standable to as broad an audience as possible. Interdisciplinary and state-of-the-art arti- cles, as well as commentaries and editorials, will be particularly welcome. Articles must not exceed 5,000 words, about five BioScience pages. Keep titles as short as possible, consistent with clarity. Illustrations and tables may be included, but since the word count above does not allow for illustrations and tables, text length should be adjusted to accommodate them. Manuscripts will be reviewed by scientists competent in the field. The editors reserve the right to edit the manuscripts; alterations will not be made without author permission. Papers are accepted for publication on the condition that they are submitted solely to BioScience and that they will not be reprinted or translated without the consent of the editors. As the publisher, the AIBS requires an assignment of copyright from all authors. Papers will usually be published in the order of acceptance. The date the manuscript was accepted will be published with the abstract. About six months usually elapse be- tween receipt of manuscript and publication. Authors must obtain written permission to reprint any copyrighted material (including tables and figures) which has been published elsewhere. Photocopies of the permission letters must be enclosed with the manuscript and credit given to the source. * Preparation of Manuscript: Manuscripts must conform to the Council of Biology Edi- tors Style Manual, 4th ed. (available from the AIBS), except for reference style (see be- low). Manuscripts should be neatly typewritten, double-spaced throughout, including ref- erences, tabular material, footnotes, captions for illustrations, etc., on one side only of 81/2 x 11 inch white bond paper. Submit the original plus one copy; the author should retain a copy. A separate title page should be provided, and footnotes, figure captions, and tables should be typed on sheets separate from the text. At least one copy must be complete with figures, tables and references. All weights and measures must be in the metric system. * Illustrations: Illustrations such as photographs, maps, line drawings, and graphs must be in "camera-ready" form (i.e., original art drawn by a commercial artist) and submitted, unmounted, with the manuscript. Number figures consecutively and identify on the re- verse side. Photographs must be glossy and from 4 x 5 to 81/2 x 10 inches in size. Gener- ally, drawings larger than 81/2 x 11 inches are not acceptable. Lettering on all illustrations must be sufficiently large to allow reduction to a double or single column. Figure captions for illustrations should be typed on a separate page or pages. * Abstract: An abstract of not more than 50 words must accompany the manuscript; therefore, a summary need not be included. * Footnotes: Footnotes in text should be kept to a minimum and should be indicated by consecutive superscript numerals. Footnotes in tables are represented by symbols (see p. 39, CBE Manual, 4th ed.). "Personal communications" are footnotes and must include name and affiliation of source and month and year of communication. * References: "References Cited" includes literature, published and unpublished, which is retrievable by readers. Citations in the text are designated by the author's name and year of publication in parentheses (Jones 1975). Use the first author's name and "et al." for publications having more than two authors (Smith et al. 1965), but list all authors in the references. All works cited in the text must be listed in "References Cited" and vice versa. Use the BIOSIS List of Serials for journal abbreviations. BioScience reference style does NOT follow the CBE Manual, 4th ed.; refer to a recent issue of the journal. Some samples are: Scholander, F. F., V. Walters, R. Hock, and L. Irving. 1950. Heat regulation in some arctic and tropical animals and birds. Biol. Bull. 99: 236-258. McNaughton, S. J., and L. L. Wolf. 1973. General Ecology. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York. Link, G. K. K. 1928. Bacteria in relation to plant diseases. Pages 590-606 in E. 0. Jordan and I. S. Falk, eds. The Newer Knowledge of Bacteriology and Immunology. Universi- ty of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL. * Reprints: Orders for reprints may be placed either before or after the issue is printed but must be prepaid or accompained by an institutional purchase order. Allow 4 weeks for delivery after publication. Minimum order: 50 copies. CIRCLE NO. 120 ON THE READER'S SERVICE CARD 768 BioScience Vol. 30 No. 11</page></plain_text>
