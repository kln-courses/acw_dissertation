BASKERVILLE Department of Anthropology, Otago University, Dunedin, New Zealand. 2 II 89 Rosenberg's "The Functional Significance of Neandertal Pubic Length" (CA 29:595-6I7) has many points with which I agree. There are, however, five aspects which</page><page sequence="2">Voluime :on Nuimbhpr a. A7m7t-ncGtonhr TORO I ARI should be further addressed, as they are critical to the understanding of causes of variation in the pelvis. The relationship between maternal size and infant size. From data derived from extant females, Rosenberg suggests that maternal body weight is a more significant determinant of infant weight and head circumference than is maternal stature. It is therefore useful to look further at data on neonate birthweights in different pop- ulations. Ethnic differences in birthweights have been seen to be due to variation in fetal growth rates rather than to variation in length of gestation (Hytten and Leitch I97I:289, 305). Do birthweights vary in relation to ethnic differences in average maternal height and weight? When Hytten and Leitch posed this question there were few studies available, but they concluded that maternal height and weight differences would not completely account for the birthweight differences, partly because of the effect of parity on birthweight. They found a good correlation between maternal (but not paternal) height and birthweight of first-borns, but for later children both correlations were low (p. 307). The Aberdeen data that Hytten and Leitch described were compared by Buckfield, Clarkson, and Herbison (I983) with their results from a study of 9,000 births in which it was assumed that the influences of parity, smoking, and hypertension on birthweights were ran- domly distributed among different maternal height groups. Maternal height was considered to be unaffected by nutrition in this New Zealand sample. The research- ers concluded that maternal height did affect birth- weight and proposed a series of adjustments to growth centile charts to correct for it. In a study of 259 women, Winikoff and Debrovner (i98i) found maternal pre-pregnancy weight signifi- cantly correlated with birthweight only in women of intermediate weight. Maternal height was significant for women of high weight for height and pregnancy weight gain for women of low weight for height. For the sample as a whole, height was significantly correlated with birthweight (p. 68I ). McKeown and Record (I954) em- phasised the influence of parity, noting that although maternal height correlated with weight for the first- born, it did not for subsequent births. They maintained that birthweight increased with birth rank (p. 459). Ox- orn (i980:653) also found that many women tended to have progressively larger babies, and Pritchard and McDonald (i980) noted that multiparity can be a factor in fetal macrosomia. Ounsted, Moar, and Scott (i982), however, found that first-borns were heavier, and Robinson (I979) spoke of a well-recognised reduction of fetal weight with increasing number of pregnancies. There is clearly no agreement on whether birthweight increases with parity or not, and it is unclear how parity is taken into account in studies that make adjust- ment for it. Garn and Pesick (i983), cited by Rosenberg, were try- ing to answer the question to what extent stature- corrected body-mass indices are more effective than ma- ternal pre-pregnancy weight in predicting the size of the neonate. This study did not take socioeconomic factors, parity, smoking by the mother, age, or gestation length into account. From the study of more than 44,000 con- secutive pregnancies, they concluded that weight pre- dicts size of the neonate better than body-mass indices that include stature in their construction, but a measure of fatness of the mother would provide more informa- tion than a weight-derived measure (p. 668). This is con- sistent with all of the studies on stature or body weight; above all, it is the well-nourished mother who has the bigger babies. (Geise [CA 29:608] points out that there are many factors that influence birthweight and that malnutrition accounts for more variation than any other.) Studies of maternal height or weight in relation to neonate size should consider whether the mother has had adequate nutrition to reach her maximum stature potential and enough nourishment during pregnancy to maintain adequate weight for her energy requirements. Weight and height measures are not independent of nu- tritional resources. It is probably sufficient in this con- text to note that the factors that may create a hostile uterine environment are mainly the same ones for which adjustment has had to be made in efforts to estab- lish the correlation between maternal weight and birth- weight. Socioeconomic status is significant, as it not only affects nutrition available to the mother but also may reflect the stature and pre-pregnancy weight of the mother and the physical demands on or exertion by her during pregnancy. These may be more intense in low- income groups. Weight may be more significant than height, as it is sensitive to immediate calorific reserves; shorter stature sometimes reflects childhood malnour- ishment, which may not affect fetal growth. Both may be predictive and could best be used in conjunction with a measure of fatness (Frisch I988:72). Neonate and maternal dimensions. It is also impor- tant for Rosenberg's thesis to demonstrate a relationship between neonate weight and neonate head size and a relationship between maternal weight and pelvic-inlet dimensions. There is not a close correlation between neonate head size and birthweight in adverse conditions. In small-for-dates neonates the factors that may inhibit uterine growth affect other aspects of the physiology be- fore affecting head size. Growth-retarded neonates have a head size very similar to that of normally developed babies, although their hearts, thymuses, and livers may be far underweight (Briend I979:3I7). There is some re- lationship between neonate head size and neonate birth- weight, but underlying Rosenberg's hypothesis is the premise that in populations in which mothers are on average heavier relative to stature, infants are also heavier and have bigger heads. The work of Allbrook and Sibthorpe (i96i) that she cites was based on a study of neonate head size among Ganda, who have a high proportion of cesarean de- liveries for small pelvic size. These workers established pelvic dimensions of go mothers by X-ray in the 36th week of pregnancy and measured 32 pelves from a skele- tal collection and the head size of 654 infants. These data were compared with Bernard's (i95 i) data on stat- ure and pelvis size in males and females in Scotland. Although the Ganda pelves were generally smaller, they</page><page sequence="3">484 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY did not show the same high incidence of the flat or platy- pelloid shape that was noted in the shorter Scottish pop- ulation. Newborn dimensions were also significantly smaller but still resulted in less "spare space" than in the Scottish sample (p. 82). In a I973 Ph.D. thesis entitled "A Study in Maternal Pelvic Capacity and Fetal Cranial Dimensions in the South African Negro and Its Bearing on Human Evolu- tion," Jordaan measured head size in 50 newborns and pelvic-inlet dimensions from IO9 adult females; brain and body weight were measured from I83 deceased new- borns, and maternal-weight/neonate-weight data were obtained from I,999 cases in hospital computer records (Jordaan I976). The disparate nature of these data made the study unwieldy. Without looking at individual cases, he found a low correlation between birthweight and in- dices of maternal size, concluding that "each fetus should be used as its own control in serial cephalome- try" (I978:59). He found no consistent relationship be- tween biparietal diameter of the neonate and birth- weight in different populations (I979:I49). A study of near-full-term neonate head size by ul- trasound scans on three different groups in Auckland by Lee and Scott (n.d.) included data from European, Maori, and Pacific Islanders, groups with very different body proportions and head sizes. They concluded that differ- ences equal to or greater than those observed in their study are quite likely to occur purely as a consequence of natural variation. Sabbagha et al. (I976) also emphasised that there is little difference in biparietal diameters be- tween ethnic groups and therefore an explanation based on ethnic differences in body weight for ethnic differ- ences in biparietal diameters is suspect. Mufioz et al. (I986) studied gestational age and head size in a Zulu population, measuring biparietal diameter by ultrasound, and related low biparietal diameters to the platypelloid shape of the Zulu pelvis. The women were mainly from a rural area with a high incidence of poor nutrition, short stature, low economic status, and intrauterine growth retardation (p. 688). Although head size is usually the last thing to suffer from malnutrition, the low biparietal diameter may be attributable to ex- tremely poor nutrition. Thus, although efforts have been made to establish a relationship between head size and birthweight of the neonate and pelvic dimensions of the mother, no general relationship has been found. Is there selection on the pelvic aperture? The obstetric literature does not confirm that the mother will die when the pelvic aperture is too small to allow passage of the infant. Maternal death is rarely directly associated with labour or pelvic form. In spite of the perception that pain signals danger, pain in labour does not indicate a life-threatening situation. The causes of 70% of mater- nal deaths in the U.K. during the period I9II-38 were sepsis, hemorrhage, and albuminuria and toxemia (Lewis i980:I22). Of the numerous causes of neonate mortality, only a very few specifically relate to pelvic anatomy (e.g., a severely contracted or rachitic pelvis). Prehistoric data on this topic are rare. In a report on maternal mortality in pre-Columbian Indians of Arica (Chile), by Arriaza, Allison, and Gerszten (i988), the causes of death of I87 females are given as septic condi- tions, acute diseases, and cultural practices. This study is particularly valuable because the very dry climate of the area ensured that the bodies were preserved as mum- mies; sex determination was by direct observation of external sex organs, as well as using the skull and pelvis. Fourteen percent of those aged between I2 and 45 years (i8 females) were considered to have died in childbirth or from complications shortly thereafter. The structure and shape of the pelvic bones of these women were nor- mal compared with those in extant Caucasoid popula- tions (p. 36). Although the researchers suggest that from about 3,000 B.P. until I,500 B.P. one in four women may have died in childbirth or of complications thereof (p. 39), these deaths are not considered to have been caused by contracted pelvic structure. In suggesting that there is selection on the pelvic aper- ture, Rosenberg cites sources that do not appear to pro- vide adequate data to substantiate this. The comments of de Souza (I 9 I 3) on mortality in females refer to "pres- ent-day" success rates for cesarean section on dwarfs; otherwise he does not discuss maternal mortality. De Souza's study was subsequent to Emmons's (I913) using the same material, and both were hampered by lack of data on neonate size in the Amerindian populations they studied. It was generally considered that the neonate head size was proportional to the pelvis (Emmons I9I3:46). I have been unable to trace any reference by Caldwell and Moloy (I933, I938), Ince and Young (I940), or Baird (i952) relating maternal mortality to contracted pelves. Allbrook and Sibthorpe's (I96I) study has al- ready been discussed; they speak only of the extreme likelihood of disaster, meaning fetal death (p. 82). Allbrook (i962) reviews the long history of dispropor- tion in East Africa, with a description of cesarean opera- tions carried out in the last century with apparently greatly reduced maternal mortality. He emphasises that the cause of the remarkably small pelvic dimensions is probably acute protein malnutrition in early develop- ment. Recovery from kwashiorkor is often only partial (p. I I2), and this is likely to be the reason for both small pelvic size and brachypellic shape (p. I 3). What does happen if the pelvis is too small? Cephalo- pelvic disproportion does apparently occur in I-2% of live births (Llewellyn-Jones I982:343). It occurs irrespec- tive of racial group and is also present in non-human primates. Most studies of parturition in primates have been derived from zoo observations of chimpanzees and gorillas and have resulted in a very widespread belief that humans are unique in their problems, e.g., that "parturition in nonhuman primates is usually performed with great expediency and lack of complication" (Harri- son and Montagna I969:28I). The ease with which Pan and Gorilla deliver is more likely to be the exception than the rule among primates. The smallness of the head size of the neonate relative to the pelvic-inlet size in these anthropoid species is a motor-related phenome- non. In the great apes, body mass and pelvic dimensions</page><page sequence="4">Volume 30, Number 4, August-October I989 | 485 are large relative to those in monkeys and Homo, but the size of the neonate does not increase, nor does gestation length (Schultz i969:i54). In fact, there are often prob- lems in parturition for many other primate species. In rhesus monkeys and baboons, it has been estimated that breech deliveries occur in i2-i6% of cases (compared with 4% in Homo). Neonate mortality in such cases is estimated at about 9% (Oshima i983:22I). Schultz (i969:i52) noted that the X-ray of a macaque near full term showed very little "room to spare" between the fetal head and the pelvic canal. This appears to be an occasional problem in most primate species that habitu- ally assume truncal erectness, with the exception of the large anthropoid apes. It is precisely because disproportion is not life-threat- ening to the mother that it persists. The mother may be very likely to have subsequent successful pregnancies. Neonate mortality is much higher for first-born than for subsequent births. There are three possible reasons for this: (i) in later pregnancies the neonate may be smaller; (2) the mother may have conceived before achieving skeletal maturity and fusion and may continue to grow after childbirth; (3) in later pregnancies the muscles, lig- aments, and bone are more sensitive to the effect of the circulating hormones, especially relaxin and estrogen, which facilitate resorption and stretching around the pelvic canal. Neonate mortality and stillbirths therefore probably have little effect on the future reproductive success of the mother. Rosenberg cites a report by Kolawole, Adamu, and Evans (I978) that "obstructed labor caused by cephalo- pelvic disproportion is the most common cause of maternal deaths and stillbirths" (p. 598). Although Kolawole et al. do cite Lister (i960) to the effect that 70% of maternal deaths are due to disproportion at the pelvic brim, Lister's data have been misrepresented in this case. Lister found that 44 of i62 maternal deaths during four years at a Nigerian hospital were attributed to obstructed labour. Of these 44 cases, 3I (70%) were due to disproportion. This represents I9% of maternal deaths (p. i90). Allbrook (i962) emphasises that pelvic physical char- acteristics may be altered in a number of ways, particu- larly by improved nutrition, and this is why the connec- tion between short stature and apparent cephalo-pelvic disproportion has to be carefully examined. There has been considerable interest in the association between height and disproportion, extended to a consideration of the relationship between shoe size and disproportion (Kennedy and Greenwald I982). Bernard (I95I) showed the influence of stature on pelvic shape in both men and women, but underlying such obstetric studies is aware- ness of the deleterious effect of malnutrition on stature. Generally speaking, shorter women may show a higher incidence of disproportion because a greater proportion of women in this group have suffered malnutrition, which not only affects stature and bone growth but also interrupts normal endocrinological functioning. When there is normal endocrinological functioning over the years after menarche before fertility commences and throughout non-conceiving fertile cycling, the increas- ing levels of circulating estrogen in adequately nour- ished women ensure a continuing process of periodically increased resorption in the pubic bone, which contrib- utes to its elongation to what we think of as the longer form typical of fertile women. Malnourished women are often shorter. They also suffer from an increased likeli- hood of a contracted pelvis because of a lack of adequate dietary sources for bone growth and endocrinological dysfunction, which may result in lower levels of cir- culating estrogen. The combined effect may result in an osteomalacic or rachitic pelvic form, with difficulties in subsequent labours. Rosenberg also maintains that "where cesarean sec- tion is available, cephalo-pelvic disproportion is one of the main indications for that procedure" (p. 598). Jagani et al. (i98i), cited in support, in fact say that "the most common indication for pelvimetry was an arrest of labor. This graphic disorder has been shown to have the highest association with cesarian section" (p. 508). Ar- rest of labour, or uterine dysfunction, has many causes. More important, these workers note that pelvic mea- surements and birthweight do not provide a predictive tool for delivery outcome (p. 507). Joyce, Giwa-Osagie, and Stevenson (I975), also cited in support, point out that "much of what had previously been considered to be disproportion was, in fact, inefficient labour" (p. 505). Cesarean section for disproportion is "only likely to be indicated when the pelvis is distorted by bony disease or fracture (p. 507, my italics). This is consistent with the Ganda data on the effect of malnutrition. O'Brien and Cefalo (i982) do not appear to give figures on the propor- tion of cesarean deliveries likely to result from cephalo- pelvic disproportion. Kaltreider (I954) reports that of 2,9I4 deliveries in which pelvimetry had been done, there were 727 cases of a contracted pelvis, of which I95 had had a cesarean section. In the group of I95 cesarean sections, there were 4 pertinent (fetal) deaths; no ma- ternal mortality associated with a contracted pelvis is mentioned. The indication for operative delivery was cephalo-pelvic disproportion in 69 cases and previous cesarean operation in 42 cases (which could include some disproportion); the other 84 cases had non-pelvic causes, such as uterine inertia. In conclusion, only in a minority of cases (between 69 and i i i out of 727) does a contracted pelvis show cephalo-pelvic disproportion to the extent that it results in cesarean section. In a very wide range of mammals the bone matrix near the pubic symphysis undergoes resorption under the in- fluence of estrogen. In hominid females an adaptation for parturition could be the maintenance of as much muscular strength as possible for support of the pregnant uterus. The large proportion of conceptions that result in spontaneous abortions because of insufficient muscular strength and continuing problems with disproportion in- dicate that selection has favoured maintenance of bone strength to maximise muscular support across the pelvic floor. The longer pubic bone in most mammalian fe- males is an accommodation to parturition that was ag- gravated for upright hominids as the functions of the</page><page sequence="5">486 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY pelvis increased to include weight bearing, especially support of the pregnant uterus. Allowing successful pas- sage of the neonate was secondary to maintenance of adequate uterine support during gestation. A major part of Rosenberg's paper is devoted to the relationship between maternal dimensions and pelvic- inlet size. There is a substantial corpus of obstetric data addressing this issue. The work of Caldwell, Moloy, and d'Esopo (I934), which appears to show some relationship between pelvic-inlet shape and body dimensions, was countered by the studies of Ince and Young (I940), Greulich, Thoms, and Twaddle (I939), and others. Care should therefore be exercised in using any of Moloy's (i 9 5 i) conclusions about body types associated with dif- ferent pelvic types. As Greulich, Thoms, and Twaddle noted (p. 493), pelvic-inlet type "cannot with certainty be deduced from external measurements, and the ability to infer it from general body build would appear to be one of the more esoteric of anthropologic accomplish- ments." In conclusion, although it is often suggested that there has been selection on the pelvic aperture to- wards increasing pelvic-inlet size for parturition in hu- mans, this has not yet been sufficiently substantiated. Determination of sex in Neanderthal pelves. Where sex determination of the Neanderthal pelves could not be made with Phenice's method, Rosenberg uses fem- oral-head diameter or acetabulum height as a sexual discriminator. However, the data she gives in table 2 for early anatomically modern humans show femoral-head diameter ranging from 47 to 49.5 for the three females and from 43 to 48.8 for the seven males. In table 3, incor- porating some additional data from Wolpoff, she lists the mean femoral-head diameter from a sample of five early anatomically modern females as 44. What were the addi- tional data from Wolpoff that could have altered the mean of 48 for a sample of three to a mean of 44 for a sample of five? I also question the use of a purported larger male femoral-head diameter to sex previously un- sexed Neanderthal specimens when that pattern of di- morphism is not observed in the early anatomically modern Homo specimens of table 2. The Neanderthal "females" in tables 2 and 3 seem to show a smaller femoral-head diameter, shorter acetab- ulo-symphyseal length, and (for the one "female" whose femoral length could be measured) shorter stature. The "males" appear to be larger in all dimensions. The La Ferrassie data cited from Tompkins and Trinkaus (i987) seem to indicate that the longer acetabulo-symphyseal length is genetically determined rather than a sexually dimorphic trait, i.e., a characteristic of a particularly ro- bust population. The larger individuals, termed "males," developed even longer pubic bones than "females" to maintain adequate biomechanical operation in bipedalism. No one knows with any certainty the sex of any of the Neanderthal individuals. It is not surprising that there is such a plethora of theories about the functional or adap- tive significance of pubic length. The long pubic bone in Homo sapiens neanderthalensis could have assisted par- turition in females, but this does not solve the problem of why, how, or when it arose and then disappeared. It was most likely secondary to the robustness and the rotation of the ilia and ischia, as seen in the Kebara pel- vis, and has no more relationship to neonate size or ges- tation length than the various pubic lengths in different populations of extant Homo. Reply KAREN R. ROSENBERG Department of Anthropology, University of Delaware, Newark, Del. I97I6, U.S.A. i9 iv 89 The maternal-body-weight hypothesis is based on the fact that maternal weight is a more significant determi- nant of infant size than maternal stature. As Baskerville points out, a great many factors influence the size of the neonate at birth in addition to the maternal variables relevant to the hypothesis. These include (but are surely not limited to) smoking, parity, nutritional status, en- ergy expenditure, fatness, and hypertension. If one were trying to predict infant size at birth, it would certainly be useful and important to include as many of these factors as possible. The assumptions of the maternal- body-weight model do not, however, require that mater- nal body weight be the only or even the most important determinant of infant size, only that it be a significant one and more important than maternal stature. Baskerville questions whether selection as a result of obstetrics acts on the human pelvis at all, arguing that "the obstetric literature does not confirm that the mother will die when the pelvic aperture is too small to allow passage of the infant." Maternal mortality due to cephalopelvic disproportion certainly was common, however, prior to the advent of modern medical inter- vention. Data taken from Shorter (i982:89) from mid- igth-century maternity hospitals in Paris (table i) show a close correlation between degree of pelvic contraction (that is, how small the birth canal is, as measured by the diagonal conjugate, an anterior-posterior diameter of the pelvic inlet) and percentage of mothers dying in child- TABLE I Mortality among Women in Mid-Igth-Century Parisian Maternity Hospitals Diagonal Maternal Conjugate N Mortality (% All mothers - - 6 Mothers with "contracted pelvises" &gt;I0 cm 301 I9 9-I0 cm 2I5 22 8-9 cm 94 22 &lt;8 cm 55 49 SOURCE: Shorter (i982:89).</page><page sequence="6">Volume 30, Number 4, August-October I989 | 487 birth. Of course, while maternal death would certainly be the most extreme form of selection acting on the pelvic aperture, it is hardly a necessary condition for selection to be occurring. Baskerville goes on to say that "of the numerous causes of neonate mortality, only a very few specifically relate to pelvic anatomy." All that must be true for selection to be acting on the pelvic aperture is that on the average women with smaller pelvic apertures pro- duce fewer offspring than women with larger pelvic apertures. Cephalopelvic disproportion need not be the most important cause of infant or maternal mortality to be a source of selection; it only has to be one cause of reduced reproductive success in females with smaller pelvic apertures. Selection can take place because of either infant or maternal mortality or, in fact, any dam- age to either mother or infant during childbirth that re- duces future reproductive potential. Even when infants die as a result of cephalopelvic dis- proportion, Baskerville argues, "the mother may be very likely to have subsequent successful pregnancies," pos- sibly because later neonates are smaller, the mother may have grown, and/or the muscles, ligaments, and bones of the pelvis may have enlarged. From this she concludes that "neonate mortality and stillbirths therefore proba- bly have little effect on the future reproductive success of the mother." Clearly, however, on the average mothers who expend time and reproductive effort in a pregnancy that does not lead to a live offspring will have lower overall reproductive success than those who do not give birth to stillborns or have babies that die in infancy. Even if women with small pelvic apertures lost only their first infants, subsequent infants being born without complication, this would constitute fairly in- tense selection against women with small pelvic dimen- sions. While factors other than genotype influence pelvic-aperture size, as Baskerville indicates (nutritional status, age, endocrine dysfunction, etc.), if there is some genetic basis to pelvic-aperture size, natural selection must operate. In populations with modern medical technology, such innovations as cesarean section have largely eliminated maternal mortality. The modern rate of cesarean section is, of course, an extremely controversial issue, especially in the United States, where cesarean sections constitute 24.4% of all births (Unnecessary cesarean sections i989). There are, as Baskerville and others have pointed out, many reasons for these cesarean sections. If any of them enhance the survival or health of mothers expe- riencing cephalopelvic disproportion or their infants, however, then before the advent of this modern technol- ogy selection would have operated in these cases. She cites a report from one study, for example, that between 69 and i i i out of 727 cases of contracted pelvis showed cephalopelvic disproportion to the extent that cesarean section was necessary and suggests that this is "only in a minority of cases." Even the lower estimate of 69 out of 727 cases would have constituted a powerful selective force. Baskerville considers the fact that obstetricians can- not predict pelvic-inlet size from "body types" an indica- tion that selection has not operated on pelvic-inlet size. What the maternal-body-weight hypothesis requires is not an association between pelvic-inlet size of mothers and either maternal weight: stature ratios or the size of newborns among individuals within populations in modern humans but the correlation of these factors be- tween populations. Pointing to the overlap in femoral-head diameter of the anatomically modern human males and females in tables 2 and 3, Baskerville questions the use of this mea- surement to determine sex in the Neandertal specimens that could not be sexed in other ways. For the recent human samples included in my analysis, femoral-head diameter was significantly larger (p &lt; .o5) in males than in females in all populations with sample sizes greater than two for each sex. In the Neandertal specimens shown in figure 2 there is no overlap in femoral-head diameter of male and female specimens of known sex. The specimen of relevance to my analysis (Krapina 2o8) falls completely outside of the male range. The sex at- tribution of that specimen and of the other Neandertal specimens that preserve a superior pubic ramus has not been disputed by any of the workers who have dealt with the pelvis in Neandertals. The maternal-body-weight hypothesis was not an at- tempt to account for all of the factors that influence birth weight, maternal pelvic dimensions, or reproduc- tive success. These are all extremely complex variables influenced by many factors, some of which Baskerville discusses. The fact that other causes may be involved does not negate the effect that obstetrics must have on the pelvis. Baskerville and others (Rak and Arensburg I987, Trinkaus i988) are correct in pointing out that differences in pelvic morphology between Neandertals and more recent humans cannot be explained purely as the result of selection acting through obstetrical difficulties. The long pubis in Neandertals is apparently the primitive condition for hominids, since it occurred in australopithecines (Frayer I985, Tague and Lovejoy i986). What must be explained, then, is why the pubis became shorter in recent humans. This may well be re- lated to such factors as recent changes in robusticity or overall body shape or possibly posture and locomotion in addition to the constraints imposed on the pelvis by ob- stetrics. An understanding of the evolution of the mod- ern human pelvis will be possible only through consider- ation of all of these factors. References Cited ALLBROOK, D. I962.
