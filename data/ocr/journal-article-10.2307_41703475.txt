Psychophysiological tools (e.g., eye tracking, skin conductance) and brain imaging tools (e.g., fMRI, EEG) have recently received heated attention in the social sciences due to their ability to complement existing sources of data with data captured directly from the human body (Lieberman 2007). Neurophysiological tools enable the measurement of human responses when people engage in various activities, such as decision making, or react to various stimuli, such as IT interfaces. There are many neurophysio- logical studies in the social sciences (e.g., Camerer 2003; Glimcher et al. 2009; Kenning and Plassmann 2005; Lee et al. 2007; Zaltman 2003), a development that has also extended to IS (e.g., Cyr et al. 2009; Dimoka 2010, 2012; Dimoka et al. 201 1; Dimoka and Davis 2008; Dimoka et al. 2007; Galletta et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2005; Randolph et al. 2006; Riedl 2009; Riedl et al. 20 1 Oa). The term NeuroIS has been coined to describe the "idea of applying cognitive neuroscience theo- ries, methods, and tools to inform IS research" (Dimoka et al. 2007, p. 1). Building upon these NeuroIS studies, this paper explores the potential of neuroscience theories and neuro- physiological methods and tools in IS research. We first review the most commonly utilized neurophysio- logical tools in the social sciences and outline their strengths and weaknesses. We then propose a research agenda where IS research can benefit from the use of neurophysiological tools as categorized under three overarching domains of IS research (Taylor et al. 2010): (1) development and use of systems, (2) IS strategy and business outcomes, and (3) group work and decision support. For each of these three areas, we discuss how various IS research topics can be informed by the use of neurophysiological tools and how neurophysiological data can complement and supplement existing sources of data. We then offer a set of recommendations on how to best employ neurophysiological tools in IS research, how to seam- lessly integrate neurophysiological data in the portfolio of existing approaches, tools, and data available to IS researchers, and how to pursue NeuroIS. We finally conclude by discussing how NeuroIS can add to existing IS research, what important research findings we expect to obtain from NeuroIS, what challenges NeuroIS might face in making substantive contributions to the IS literature, and how to establish NeuroIS as a viable subfield in IS research. The paper proceeds as follows: the following section reviews the most commonly used neurophysiological tools and dis- cusses their strengths and limitations. The subsequent section discusses several research questions that may benefit from the 680 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 use of neurophysiological tools in three key areas of IS research (Taylor et al. 2010). We then offer recommendations for intelligently pursuing NeuroIS and promoting NeuroIS as a viable subfield. Strengths and Weaknesses of Neurophysiological Tools This section discusses the strengths and weaknesses of popu- lar psychophysiological and neuroimaging tools that could inform IS research. A brief description of these tools is available in Table 1 and Appendix A. Major Strengths of Neurophysiological Tools The promise of NeuroIS is to complement existing research tools with neurophysiological tools that can provide reliable data which are difficult or impossible to obtain with tradi- tional tools, such as self-reported or archival data. The pri- mary advantage of physiological and brain data is that subjects cannot consciously manipulate their responses since these are not readily subject to manipulation. For example, it might be possible to use fMRI as a lie detector as there is often a higher (unconscious) activation in the prefrontal cortex of subjects who lie versus those who do not (Harris 2010). As neurophysiological data are generally not suscep- tible to subjectivity bias, social desirability bias, and demand effects,2 they could complement existing sources of data, triangulate across measurement data, and reduce common method bias by not relying on any single measurement method (e.g., Dimoka et al. 201 1). Neurophysiological tools are particularly valuable for measuring IS constructs that people are either unable, uncomfortable, or unwilling to truth- fully self-report; this may include sensitive issues (e.g., gender, race, culture, religion), personal issues (e.g., goals or fears), deep or hidden emotions (e.g., guilt, fears, and anger), automated processes (e.g., habit and automaticity), complex cognitive processes (e.g., cognitive overload), social dyna- mics (social cognition), antecedents of human behaviors (e.g., beliefs, attitudes, and intentions), and moral issues (e.g., ethics and moral judgments). Moreover, while self-reports may not be able to capture unconscious processes that are unavailable to introspection, 2 Demand effects refer to a bias in which the subject understands the experi- ment's purpose and either consciously or unconsciously changes her response to act upon what she believes the experimenter is expecting her to do.</page><page sequence="3">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research Neurophysiological Tools Focus of Measurement Psychophysiological Tools Eye Tracking Eye pupil location ("gaze") and movement Skin Conductance Response (SCR) Sweat in eccrine glands of the palms or feet Facial Electromyography (fEMG) Electrical impulses caused by muscle fibers Electrocardiogram (EKG) Electrical activity of the heart on the skin Brain Imaging Tools Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Neural activity by changes in blood flow Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Metabolic activity by radioactive isotopes Electroencephalography (EEG) Electrical brain activity on the scalp Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Changes in magnetic fields by brain activity neurophysiological tools can capture unconscious processes with direct responses from the human body. Neurophysio- logical data can thus offer information that is complementary, supplementary, or even contradictory to self reporting, obser- vation, and secondary data because they are less subjective and are not restricted to conscious awareness and revealed preferences. Neurophysiological data have the advantage of continuous real-time measurement that allows collecting data contin- uously on a real-time basis while a subject is executing a task or responding to a specific stimulus (usually not easily afforded by self reports or observation). This enables a level of temporal precision that allows a researcher to temporally match the task or stimulus to the neurophysiological response virtually in real-time. By permitting continuous real-time data collection and powerful time-series analysis, neurophysiological tools are able to capture the flow of either a single construct or many constructs simultaneously, thus allowing us to infer the temporal order of either the dimensions of a single IS construct or two or more IS constructs that are spawned by a certain task or stimulus. Because temporal precedence is a key prerequisite of causality (Cook and Campbell 1979; Zheng and Pavlou 2010), neurophysiological studies can potentially help infer causal relationships among IS constructs. Major Weaknesses of Neurophysiological Tools Neurophysiological tools also have weaknesses (Riedl et al. 2010a). Most weaknesses apply across all tools, albeit at different degrees (e.g., cost), and we specify the extent to which these weaknesses are mostly for psychophysiological (Appendix A, Table Al) or neuroimaging (Appendix A, Table A2) tools. Cost and Accessibility A primary weakness of neurophysiological tools is cost (Appendix A, Table A3). While the cost of psychophysio- logical tools is manageable (currently it costs between $ 1 0,000 and $20,000 U.S. to equip a lab with physiological tools), the cost of neuroimaging tools is substantial (between $100 and $600 U.S. per scanning hour), given the need for technicians with specialized knowledge. While the use of repeated measures from each subject coupled with the precision of objective data require fewer subjects per study (for example, most fMRI studies only need 10 to 20 subjects), cost is still an issue that is best answered by the person paying for the studies relative to the expected insights (Camerer et al. 2004). Accessibility is another issue, since neurophysiological tools reside in medical facilities dedicated to clinical use (Husing et al. 2006). Nonetheless, major universities worldwide have facilities with neurophysiological tools, plus hospitals and clinics often rent their neuroimaging tools for research purposes. Artificial Setting The experimental context in which neurophysiological tools are used creates an artificial environment that limits the external validity of NeuroIS studies. Different neurophysio- logical tools (Appendix A) vary in their degree of artificiality. For example, fMRI and PET scanners are cylindrical full-body tubes and require subjects to remain still during the study. MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 681</page><page sequence="4">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research Most neurophysiological tools use various sensors attached to the human body that may themselves induce stress and bias the results. Eye tracking tools often need subjects to wear special equipment, such as a headgear, creating an artificial setting. While neurophysiological tools continuously enhance their interfaces, including improvements such as less constrained and less noisy fMRI scanners and eye trackers without a headgear, it is recommended that researchers replicate the experiment in a more traditional setting and compare the corresponding behavioral responses to test for external validity. Labor-intensive Data Extraction and Analysis The ability of neurophysiological tools to collect real-time data directly from the human body is accompanied by a dif- ficulty in extracting such intense amounts of data, including correcting for movement (such as fMRI or eye tracking), preparation for proper recordings (such as electrode place- ment for EKG), sometimes manual data extraction (such as observation in eye tracking studies), and enormous amounts of imaging data (such as fMRI/EEG). The analysis of vast amounts of neurophysiological data can thus be a daunting task, especially if there is a need for data preprocessing (such as fMRI data). While advanced software tools can support data analysis for each tool, the statistical analysis of large amounts of data from the human body is still a non-trivial task. For example, fMRI data must go through slice timing correction, realignment, coregistration, segmentation, normal- ization, and smoothing in preparing for data analysis (for a review, see Dimoka 2011; Frackowiak et al. 2004; Friston 2004). Measurement Issues First, there are content validity concerns about whether neurophysiological data capture the constructs they are intended to measure. At the individual subject level, neurophysiological responses often vary from a common baseline and may be triggered differently by external confounds that cannot be perfectly isolated. For example, heart rate measured by EKG can be influenced by many stimuli that need to be experimentally controlled for. There are also differences between right- and left-handed people, women and men, and younger and older adults. Habituation to stimuli may also be different across subjects; for example, electrodermal response in SCR may vary among subjects. While a careful experimental design can largely address such issues, it is necessary to realize that neurophysiological data could be affected by numerous factors and appropriate steps 682 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 should be followed in order to minimize intersubject vari- ability. For instance, to account for cortical differences in fMRI and PET, brain images must be normalized to a common template. Experimental designs can overcome cortical dif- ferences with a proper baseline for meaningful comparisons, such as within-subjects designs that help reduce error variance by using each subject as her/his own control. Mono-Operationalization Bias In the manner in which neurophysiological tools are often deployed, there is also a distinct possibility of mono- operationalization bias and construct validation concerns. When one gathers only a single measure for a given construct, there is no easy way to assess the internal consistency of measures, and thus measure reliability (Cook and Campbell 1979). Measurement error, thus, is unknown in such cases since there is no way to separate the true score from the error. In this case, there is a viable solution of test-retest reliability, but this involves an additional measurement with the same stimuli. In many settings, this will simply not be feasible, and scholars should argue for the likelihood that their data is still reasonable (Straub et al. 2004). Even with single measures, discriminant validity can still be assessed; however, for convergent validity (factorial validity), multiple measures of each construct are required (Gefen et al. 2000). Difficulty in Interpreting Neurophysiological Results Neurophysiological results may also not be as straightforward to interpret as traditional sources of data. This is largely due to the mapping of neurophysiological measures to theoretical constructs. For example, the meaning of various eye tracking measures is still a debated issue, and eye fixations and gaze have been attributed to multiple constructs, such as com- plexity, difficulty, interest, and importance (Rayner 1998). Also, in fMRI studies, a naive expectation of a one-to-one mapping between a brain area and a theoretical construct has made it difficult to interpret the meaning of brain activations (Logothetis 2008). Simply put, a certain neurophysiological measure can be linked to several theoretical constructs. Furthermore, a lack of a standard terminology and definitions may create difficulties in interpreting neurophysiological results. Manipulation and Ethics It is sometimes feared that neurophysiological tools could be used to manipulate behavior. However, they can only observe,</page><page sequence="5">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools In IS Research not manipulate behavior.3 Neurophysiological tools may also capture private issues that people may not be willing to consciously share. Thus, NeuroIS must be governed by strict ethical rules. In conclusion, neurophysiological tools have several impor- tant strengths that can advance IS research. Nonetheless, they also have certain challenges that must be acknowledged to fully harness their potential. Developing a Research Agenda for NeuroIS A research agenda for NeuroIS needs to draw upon the vast neuroscience literature in the social sciences that has been rapidly expanding over the last two decades. IS researchers are thus advised to first become familiar with prominent neuroscience theories and more specifically with findings about the localization of various processes and constructs in the brain (e.g., Dimoka et al. 201 1). There is also a rapidly growing field termed social neuroscience that focuses on integrating neuroscience theories with applications in psycho- logy, marketing, and economics (e.g., Lieberman 2009). See Appendix B for a detailed review. Dimoka et al. (201 1) proposed seven specific opportunities that IS researchers can pursue with the aid of neurophysio- logical tools to inform IS research: (1) localizing the neural correlates of IS constructs,4 (2) capturing hidden or uncon- scious processes, (3) complementing existing data with neurophysiological data, (4) identifying and testing ante- cedents of IS constructs, (5) testing outcomes of IS con- structs, (6) inferring the temporal ordering of IS constructs, and (7) challenging existing assumptions and enhancing IS theories. Building upon these opportunities on the potential of NeuroIS, we elaborate on how IS research can benefit from neuro- physiological tools and how neurophysiological data can complement extant sources of IS data. We focus on three areas of IS research that have been suggested as adequately spanning the IS discipline (Taylor et al. 2010): (1) develop- ment and use of systems ; (2) IS strategy and business out- comes, and (3) group work and decision support. For each area, we propose a set of research topics (Table 2) that seek to offer a representative depiction of how IS research can benefit from the use of neurophysiological tools. The examples in Table 1 are intended to be merely repre- sentative of how neurophysiological tools can be used to enrich some areas of IS research, and we neither seek to offer an exhaustive coverage of all IS research areas that could use neurophysiological tools nor imply that any other IS area might not benefit from the use of neurophysiological tools. We simply encourage IS researchers to assess whether their own topics of interest could be enhanced by the use of neuro- physiological tools. Additional opportunities for NeuroIS by including the moderating role of culture, gender, and age are discussed in Appendix C. Opportunities in Development and Use of Systems The opportunities from using neurophysiological tools in the development and use of systems focus on (1) enhancing the individual adoption and use of systems, (2) reducing infor- mation and cognitive overload, and (3) encouraging trans- actions by online consumers, as outlined in detail below. Encouraging Individual Adoption and Use of Systems There are several opportunities for IS research on encouraging individual adoption and use of systems using neurophysio- logical tools; these are summarized in Table 3 and elaborated in more detail below. First, neurophysiological tools can shed light on our under- standing of the nature and dimensionality of constructs related to the adoption and use of systems by identifying their neural correlates. While the neural correlates of the original TAM constructs (perceived usefulness and ease of use) have already been identified (Dimoka and Davis 2008), the nature of other constructs related to system use, particularly hedonic ones, such as enjoyment, anxiety, and flow, are still not well under- stood. Neurophysiological tools, such as fMRI, could help understand the nature of these constructs better and tease out differences among them. MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 683 3Similar to other lab studies, external stimuli can manipulate behavior, especially if they are administered in real-time based on neurophysiological responses. Also, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can temporarily desensitize certain brain areas, thereby affecting behavior. Nonetheless, such manipulations can only be induced in a lab setting. 4In terms of identifying the neural correlates of IS constructs, there are several ways to induce brain activation in response to IS constructs, such as images of people who exhibit certain attributes (e.g., trustworthiness to induce trust), experimental games (e.g., trust game), or scenarios that induce certain perceptions, such as trust. Dimoka (2010) also proposed a method to induce brain activation that underlies IS constructs by using measurement items as triggers. This capability of neurophysiological tools has interesting implications for assessing both reliability and construct validity.</page><page sequence="6">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research Area of Research Sample Topics Encouraging Individual Technology Adoption and Use Development and Use of Systems • Assessing Information and Cognitive Overload Encouraging Transactions by Online Consumers Developing Information Systems Strategy IS Strategy and Business Outcomes • Enhancing the Design of Organizational Systems Promoting Technological Fairness in Organizations Enhancing online Group Collaboration and Decision Support Group Work and Decision Support • Designing Online Decision Aids Understanding and Building Online Trust Application Sample Research Opportunities 1 .

Understanding causality issues related to system adoption and use constructs. 6. Assessing both instrumental systems and hedonic systems Second, neurophysiological tools can uncover new insights about system adoption and use that may not be inferred with existing tools by identifying hidden or unconscious processes that cannot be self-reported. For example, challenging the literature that has viewed the two TAM constructs to be purely cognitive, evidence showed that perceived usefulness may originate in the "emotional" areas of the brain, such as the insular cortex (which is associated with emotional losses), and the anterior cingulate cortex that interfaces emotional and cognitive brain areas (Dimoka et al. 201 1). This is consistent with Cenfetelli (2004) and Venkatesh (2000) who showed the role of emotions in technology adoption, the marketing literature that noted the role of emotions in the adoption of innovations (Wood and Moreau 2006), and Bagozzi's (2007) call for including emotions in system use. Extending this stream, neurophysiological tools can identify other hidden or unconscious processes linked to constructs related to indi- vidual adoption and use of systems. Neurophysiological tools can also help understand post- adoption system use, which is largely unconscious and not controlled by self-reported conscious thoughts (e.g., Frank and Claus 2006; Lieberman 2007). Third, identifying the neural correlates of the determinants of system adoption and use opens avenues for designing systems that trigger activation in certain brain areas, such as the caudate nucleus for utility, or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for reduced cognitive overload. Activations in these brain areas can become a guide for how systems can be designed to encourage adoption, and neurophysiological data can inform the design of specific features to enhance system adoption and use. Neurophysiological tools can also assist system designers to directly test their designs with neurophysiological data, thus having less need to rely on subjective self-reported data that may not track well with actual system use (Straub et al. 1995). These tools may be able to assess what Burton-Jones and Straub (2006) refer to as deep structure usage. As another example, eye tracking tools may allow system designers to effectively place material on the screen based on where the user is looking and where the user's eyes move when using a system. NeuroIS studies can also help establish direct usability criteria by linking usability metrics (e.g., efficiency, quality) with neurophysiological metrics. Such neurophysiological studies can use existing systems with different levels of usability on particular dimen- sions to examine how technical differences are represented as physiological or neural differences. These studies may also uncover additional constructs that drive the adoption and use of systems which users may have been unable to articulate via self-reported measures, as well as emotional or hedonic pro- cesses which users may have been unwilling to report (e.g., 684 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012</page><page sequence="7">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research anxiety, flow). Having identified the physiological or neural correlates of usability, neurophysiological tools could enable designers to use these measures to evaluate future IT systems and design modifications based on how well these systems perform in practice. For example, if the evaluation of a system with neurophysiological tools uncovers negative emo- tions, system designers could try to spot a flaw that causes such emotional distress, thus helping design more effective systems. This could help us in designing systems to reduce technostress (Ayyagari et al. 201 1). System designers could also capture the user's cognitive style (e.g., verbal, visual) and examine whether cognitive style affects how people adopt and use systems. As neurophysiological tools may identify the neural correlates of cognitive style (Benbasat and Taylor 1978), they may help to objectively measure spatial attention and processing style, thus exploring how individual dif- ferences in terms of cognitive style may play a role in the design of systems that encourage adoption. Finally, neurophysiological tools may identify causal links among the drivers of system adoption and use. For example, fMRI studies that identify brain activations in the areas asso- ciated with perceived usefulness and ease of use can also shed light on their temporal ordering (Dimoka and Davis 2008). Because emotional processes often precede cognitive ones (Pessoa 2008), and since perceived usefulness is shown to be linked with affective brain areas in the limbic system (Dimoka et al. 2011), neurophysiological tools could be used to examine whether ease of use does precede usefulness, as TAM asserts. For example, knowledge of which TAM con- struct precedes the other in the brain could shed light on mediation hypotheses in the TAM model (Pavlou 2003) with practical implications (e.g., Meuter et al. 2005). While fMRI might be able to infer the temporal dynamics between these two constructs, given its limited temporal resolution, fMRI may need to be complemented by MEG or EEG, which have superior temporal resolution. Because causal inference cannot be inferred solely by temporal precedence (Zheng and Pavlou 2010), the use of TMS to temporarily inhibit brain activity in isolated areas may be useful in order to study whether the areas associated with perceived ease of use and usefulness are needed to determine the causal links leading to IT system adoption and use. Assessing Information and Cognitive Overload The proposed opportunities related to assessing information and cognitive overload are summarized in Table 4 and are discussed in more detail below. Assessing information and cognitive overload has long been an area of interest in the IS literature (e.g., Eppler and Mengis 2004; O'Reilly 1980). Such overload arises from having too much information when a person is performing a task (Wur- man 1990) and from the difficulty in inferring what informa- tion is required for the task (Kirsh 2000). Toward reducing information and cognitive overload, IS researchers often design systems that aim at reducing the information com- plexity of the task (enabling users to simplify their decision making), or enhancing the user's information processing capabilities by better showing information (Galbraith 1974). However, the measurement of information and cognitive overload has been elusive in the literature due to self-reports and expert evaluations (e.g., Payne et al. 1992). There is a need for a direct measurement of information and cognitive overload, and neurophysiological tools have the potential to offer such a direct measurement. For example, EKG could directly measure whether a certain interface increases the user's heart rate, thus inferring anxiety or stress. Eye tracking tools can capture whether a user finds it difficult to identify information by observing how her or his eyes wander aimlessly on a computer screen. In terms of measuring cognitive overload, the cognitive neuroscience literature has shown that activation in the pre- frontal cortex is associated with tasks of higher information load (e.g., Linden et al. 2003) and working memory (e.g., Braver et al. 1997). The DLPFC has been involved in such higher-order functions, namely cognition and problem olving (Rypma and D'Esposito 1999); specifically there is an inverted-U function that describes the level of brain activation in the DLPFC relative to the degree of cognitive overload as DLPFC activation decreases "as subjects become over- whelmed and subsequently disengage from the task" (Calli- cott et al. 1999, p. 25). Cognitive overload may also be asso- ciated with activation in the emotional areas (e.g., frustration), which can be captured directly by neurophysiological tools (e.g., Abler et al. 2005), such as EKG through higher heart rate, SCR through sweat excretion, or fEMG through facial gestures. Based on the neural correlates of cognitive overload, NeuroIS studies could test whether IT artifacts can reduce cognitive overload by measuring brain activity when users undertake cognitive tasks. Apart from directly measuring if cognitive overload is reduced with the aid of IT, neurophysiological tools could also shed light on whether the reduction of cogni- tive overload is due the simplification of the information complexity of the task (viewed as reduction in DLPFC activation) or due to the enhancement of the user's informa- tion processing capabilities by better processing information (increased DLPFC activation without a drop in the inverted-U function). These findings could also be used in the design of IT systems that reduce cognitive overload, either by simpli- fying the task or by enhancing the user's capabilities (or both).

Identifying product quality signals to mitigate product uncertainty based on the neural correlates of product uncertainty. Capturing emotions that could be activated at high levels of cognitive overload (e.g., frustration) can identify problems users face when engaging in cognitive tasks. For example, neuroimaging tools could be used to test if IT systems designed to enhance combinatorial auctions by offering structured information on the auction have the expected effect (Adomavicius et al. 2010). Neuroimaging data could also be used to improve the design of these IT interfaces by identifying their ability to reduce cognitive overload and prevent mental collapse and emotional breakdown. Finally, neurophysiological tools could enable the evaluation of IT interfaces, link neuroimaging data to economic (auction) outcomes, and measure constructs (cognitive overload and emotional processes) that are generally difficult to measure (Ba and Pavlou 2002). Encouraging Transactions by Online Consumers There are also opportunities for encouraging transactions by online consumers in electronic markets to enhance the adoption of e-commerce, which are summarized in Table 5 and discussed in more detail below. Similar to encouraging system adoption by users (Venkatesh and Davis 2000), there is a rich literature on constructs that promote or inhibit the adoption and use of commercial web- sites (e.g., Cenfetelli 2004; Pavlou and Fygenson 2006), such as usefulness, ease of use, trust, privacy, security, and self- efficacy. However, it is not clear whether all of these ante- cedents are clearly distinct from each other and whether it is possible to identify a more parsimonious e-commerce adop- tion model. Specifying the neural correlates of the ante- cedents of website adoption by consumers could shed light on their distinctiveness or convergence. For example, Dimoka and Davis (2008) showed that website usefulness and ease of use are distinct constructs that span distinct brain areas. Neurophysiological tools can test related antecedents of web- site adoption, such as self-efficacy and ease of use, usability, navigability and diagnosticity, and privacy and security. Moreover, hedonic factors that have been shown to encourage website adoption could be examined as well. These findings can help specify the nature and dimensionality of these ante- cedent factors and result in more valid e-commerce adoption models that better correspond to the functionality of the human body. Neurophysiological tools can help identify additional "hidden" factors that have not been captured by earlier studies. For example, if a brain area that enables or inhibits website adoption is linked to a hidden or unconscious process recognized in the neuroscience literature, it may uncover new antecedents that have been neglected to date. Notably, decep- tion, such as phishing, has been an impediment to online transactions. This valid point notwithstanding, detecting deception may be difficult to study with behavioral studies 686 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012</page><page sequence="9">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research that ask subjects to detect fraud (Pavlou and Gefen 2005). This is where neurophysiological tools could be valuable by exposing subjects to fraudulent websites and identifying differences in physiological or neural responses when subjects interact with various websites. Neurophysiological tools, such as fMRI, might be able to capture where deception occurs in the brain while psychophysiological tools such as eye tracking may help identify how expert online consumers detect fraud. These findings could be used to identify how learning can be achieved in fearful situations, such as phishing websites, and how effective patterns for detecting deceptive websites can be enhanced with the aid of IT tools. IS researchers have long noted differences when consumers interact with similar website interfaces. For example, Bapna et al. (2004) identified distinct bidding strategies used by consumers in online auctions. Further, they showed that new IT interfaces and minor variations in auction rules result in interesting and logically sound bidding practices. Similarly, Adomavicius et al. (2007) showed that information revelation strategies can affect bidder behavior in complex combinatorial auctions. Still, the theoretical explanation of bidder behavior is difficult to uncover with self-reported measures in experi- ments, surveys, or interviews, such as those dealing with trust and perceived risk (Pavlou and Gefen 2004). Neurophysio- logical tools could assist in the design of metrics for complex constructs such as trust, perceived risk, cognitive effort, and competitive fervor toward reconciling observed actions with bidder intent and offer a better explanation of observed bidder behavior. These perceptual measures are generally difficult to measure with self reports, thus neurophysiological data can complement and expand existing e-commerce and auction metrics. Online collaborative shopping and social shopping networks are becoming popular by allowing consumers to incorporate their social circle in the otherwise impersonal online trans- action environment (e.g., Zhu et al. 2010). Understanding how consumers interact with others is an important area where neurophysiological tools could help in the design of collaborative tools that enable consumers to engage in social learning and transact together within a social network. Neurophysiological data can be used to identify patterns of cooperative social behavior by drawing upon the neural correlates of social cognition (Adolphs 1999) to design collaborative tools that support cooperative social behavior and social learning. Neurophysiological tools can also help assess how consumers react to a website's information design, including search results, banner adds, or news stories. There is an increased interest in understanding how consumers evaluate material and stimuli on websites to make purchasing decisions (e.g., Dou et al. 2010). The assessment of a website's information design typically happens quickly and often unconsciously, making it difficult for researchers to understand how con- sumers make such evaluations. The advantage of neuro- physiological tools to offer real-time measurement of what consumers see on a website and what thoughts and emotions the information triggers in their mind could be useful in improving website design and facilitating transactions. There is an emerging literature on how eye tracking helps evaluate website designs (e.g., Pan et al. 2004; Tzanidou 2003) by enabling direct real-time tracking of where a consumer is looking and where her eyes are moving on a website. Neuro- physiological tools can also be useful in placing information, such as static text, photos, or video, on a website to facilitate browsing and transacting. As website use becomes even more frequent and perhaps habitual, e-commerce research may need to add familiarity, learning, and habit into models of post-adoption website use. Neurophysiological tools can help identify habits and learned patterns in website use that may not readily be uncovered with self reports or observation because such patterns may not be available for introspection. For example, eye tracking tools can compare novice and expert website users to identify differences that may help novice users and improve their web- site interaction. Neurophysiological tools can also compare physiological or neural differences across consumers who visit a website for the first time versus repeat visitors, and they can identify how learning to use a website occurs over time across consumers. Eye tracking seems to be a very use- ful tool to study habitual tasks and how people evolve from novices to experts (Karn et al. 1997). These studies could uncover useful insights about learning habits for first-time versus repeat website users that could help website designers customize their websites to cater to different consumers (e.g., first-time versus repeat). Understanding and mitigating uncertainty has been touted an important impediment for online markets given the physical and temporal separation among buyers, sellers, and products (e.g., Ghose 2009; Pavlou et al. 2007). Granados et al. (2006) also argued that competition around information and price transparency must occur in order to reduce uncertainty. How- ever, our current understanding of the construct of uncertainty is relatively limited, and the IS literature has generally treated seller and product uncertainty as a unitary construct. The literature on understanding and mitigating uncertainty could be advanced by neurophysiological tools. First, similar to how Dimoka (2010) has shown that trust and distrust are distinct constructs that reside in distinct brain areas, drawing on the neuroscience literature that has extensively studied MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 687</page><page sequence="10">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research uncertainty (Appendix B), brain imaging studies could localize the neural correlates of seller and product uncertainty to identify if they are viewed by consumers as distinct constructs. Although the literature has focused on mitigating seller uncer- tainty through trust and other means, there is still very little work on mitigating product uncertainty (Ghose 2009). Evidence from the literature shows that distinct brain areas are responsible when evaluating products (product uncertainty) and people (seller uncertainty) (Grinband et al. 2006; Yoon et al. 2006). The neural correlates of product uncertainty may shed light on its nature, such as whether it is linked to primarily cognitive or emotional brain areas. This knowledge may help design product quality signals that can effectively reduce product uncertainty. The neural correlates of product uncertainty may help test the effectiveness of product quality signals that have been proposed in the IS literature, such as product diagnosticky (e.g., Jiang and Benbasat 2004), product descriptions (Jiang and Benbasat 2007), third-party certi- ficates (Li et al. 2009), and product condition disclosures (Ghose 2009). Neurophysiological tools can also look into the timing of the neural correlates of product and seller uncertainty to infer whether consumers first assess product or seller uncertainty, thus guiding the design and timing of seller or product quality signals on websites. A challenge for consumers is the difficulty of feeling and trying physical products before transacting. Virtual reality, video, and static information displays, and other product quality signals that can enhance product understanding are alternative means available to web designers (Jiang and Benbasat 2007). Physiological tools can assess whether and to what degree product information signals trigger attention (e.g., eye tracking tools) and emotions (e.g., fEMG). Also, SCR and EKG could help capture stress levels when dealing with uncertain purchases. Also, the aesthetics of the overall presentation of product quality signals can be enhanced with physiological tools by measuring whether users have some negative reactions to these signals, such as unwanted emo- tions. Finally, neurophysiological tools can be used to spot "fake" product quality signals that misrepresent product quality, helping consumers focus on legitimate signals. Opportunities in Information Systems Strategy and Business Outcomes The proposed research opportunities on IS strategy and business outcomes focus on (1) developing IS strategy, (2) enhancing the design of organizational systems, and (3) promoting technological fairness. 688 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 Developing Information Systems Strategy We next propose a set of opportunities for IS strategy and achieving favorable business outcomes by enhancing strategic decision making. This is summarized in Table 6 and dis- cussed in more detail below. First, drawing upon the extensive neuroscience literature on individual decision making, we argue that we can better understand the basis of managerial decision making with the aid of neurophysiological tools. As reviewed in Appendix B, there is a rich literature on how people make decisions by using calculative and emotional aspects in their decision making (Ernst and Paulus 2005) and how simple emotional cues can simplify complex and uncertain decisions under the somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio 1994). Moreover, there is evidence that more successful decision makers are those who combine both cognitive and emotional aspects (Hsu et al. 2005). This actually corresponds to findings in the strategy literature that intuition is useful for complex actions under uncertainty (Gigerenzer and Selten 2001). Building upon the neuroscience literature, neurophysiological tools could examine how to facilitate strategic decision making in uncer- tain environments, perhaps focusing on CIOs (chief informa- tion officers) as subjects (Banker et al. 2011). Although neurophysiological studies with CIOs and senior executives may be difficult to conduct, it is not uncommon to have studies with real professionals. For instance, Lo and Repin (2002) examined professional foreign exchange traders when trading currencies in a simulated exercise with contracts over $1 million. Neurophysiological studies of decision making under uncer- tainty would also correspond well with the recent emphasis on IT strategy in turbulent environments that examines cases where strategic decisions must be made quickly and under uncertain and changing conditions (Pavlou and El Sawy 2006). While there is a need to generalize findings from artificial individual decision making by subjects to real decision making by true executives, neurophysiological tools can offer useful insights into how to facilitate decision making via cognitive and emotional markers and more effectively help IT strategy executives make better decisions. Moreover, achieving alignment between IT and business functions has been one of the most important goals of IS strategy research (e.g., Henderson and Venkatraman 1994), thus leading to the introduction of digital business strategy (Bharadwaj et al. 2010). However, much of the difficulty in integrating IT and business lies in coordinating actions between these two functions at virtually all organizational levels (Reich and Benbasat 1996).

Designing organizational incentives that are based on the functionality of the human body (e.g., aligned goals, theory of mind, and social coordination). ture has identified the brain basis of joint action and has shed light on how the brain helps coordinate actions, goals, and intentions (Newman-Norlund et al. 2007). Moreover, there is literature on the neural correlates of social cooperation (Rilling et al. 2002) and theory of mind (McCabe et al. 2001). Extending these findings, neurophysiological tools could examine how to coordinate actions and goals across IT and business functions and how to promote cooperation between IT and business people by designing appropriate incentives that are based on the underlying brain functionality of aligned goals, theory of mind, and social coordination. Finally, the IS strategy literature has focused on developing capabilities to execute daily activities (operational capa- bilities), engage in planned reconfiguration (dynamic capa- bilities), and spontaneously respond to surprising changes (improvisational capabilities) (e.g., Pavlou and El Sawy 2006, 2010). Despite the theoretical distinction among these three capabilities, it is not clear whether they correspond to how organizations actually function. The distinction between dynamic and improvisational capabilities is still an unsettled issue in the literature (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000). In that neurophysiological tools can localize the neural correlates of human activities, it would be very possible to examine where spontaneous improvisation occurs in the brain and if it differs from planned change. In doing so, neurophysiological tools could help resolve debates in the IS strategy literature that could not be easily examined otherwise. Enhancing the Design of Organizational Systems Neurophysiological tools can help with the design and use of organizational systems (Table 7). First, the successful implementation of organizational ERP systems relies on reducing the functionality misfit that arises due to gaps between the functionalities offered by an ERP package and those required by the organization (Rolland and Prakash 2000). This misfit is difficult to assess because of the complexity of ERP systems and the lack of appropriate mea- sures of functional needs from a usage perspective, similar to individual adoption and use. Neurophysiological tools can identify neurological indicators that help create metrics of the misfit in such ex ante analysis. In general, neurophysiological tools may offer complementary metrics from theories that seek to reduce misfit, theories such as cognitive fit theory, which looks at the interaction between problem representation and problem-solving (Vessey 1991). As cognitive fit theory views the process as taking place within a mental model (Zhang 1997), neurophysiological tools could inform the metrics suggested by this theory by capturing the neural correlates of cognitive fit and misfit and offering metrics that could be used in the design of organizational systems. Also, the fundamental tenets of how organizations manipulate the characteristics of the problem and task representation can be studied with NeuroIS to define contextual metrics of mental representation for use in designing and testing ERP systems. Second, in addition to organizational systems such as ERP, failure to design systems with the user in mind has been touted as one of the most important barriers to the success of interorganizational systems (IOS) (Barrett and Konsynski 1982). Although the design of IOS with the user in mind is necessary, much of the literature has focused on technologi- cally "optimal" systems that may not be necessarily consistent with how people use systems in organizations (Minnery and Fine 2009). Thus, there is potential value in gathering neuro- physiological responses when evaluating IOS prototypes, and neurophysiological tools may help complement existing sources of data and provide novel insights into the design of IOS. The connection between IOS and organizational design is related to the construct of bounded rationality, which refers to "neurophysiological limitations to the information pro- cessing capacities (memory, computation and communica- tion)" (Bakos and Treacy 1986, p. 109). Neurophysiological tools can help assess the role of IOS in enhancing the infor- mation processing capacity of organizational users to inform the design of IOS. Besides, activation in certain brain areas can serve as a proxy for how organizational incentives should be designed to effectively use IOS, and neurophysiological tools could conceivably help inform IS research.

Designing fair incentives for accepting technology investment proposals that go beyond material rewards that enhance the organization's interest. Finally, an important question that has recently arisen in IS research is the use of IT to reproduce genuine artifacts in museum organizations and other archaeological sites (Pallud and Straub 2007). Although a variety of IT artifacts have been designed to augment reality (Vlahakis et al. 2002), there is a debate whether users appreciate such artificial IT artifacts. Measuring visitors' perceptions, such as emotions and aesthetics, may be used to enhance self-reported measures. Neurophysiological tools can also offer measures of what people perceive in IT versus genuine artifacts. For example, an fMRI study that presents subjects with different artifacts can identify differences in brain activations between IT- generated and genuine artifacts. These differences can be compared to the neuroscience literature on emotions and can be linked to constructs that relate to aesthetics, such as pleasure/displeasure. In the neuroscience literature, pleasant pictures activate the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (Sabatinelli et al. 2007), while displeasure activates the superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus (Britton et al. 2006). Also, other cognitive and emotional processes may be activated differentially in the brain between IT and genuine artifacts due to other factors that may enter a visitor's mindset (Pallud and Straub 2007). Those may be related to content (activation in the anterior cingulate cortex due to utility) (McClure et al. 2004), ease of use (activation in DLPFC due to calculation) (Dimoka et al. 201 1), promotions (activation in caudate nucleus due to higher rewards) (Delgado et al. 2005), anger (activation in orbitofrontal cortex) (Murphy et al. 2003), or authenticity (whose neural correlates have still not been identified). 690 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 Promoting Technological Fairness in Organizational Settings We next discuss research opportunities for promoting tech- nological fairness in organizations and preventing unfairness, which are summarized in Table 8 and elaborated in more detail below. First, decisions in organizations need collaborative agreement between several individuals or subunits to share technology costs and to enhance the benefit generated by the technology. Incentives of these multiple decision makers must be well aligned to enable collaborative agreements. These issues are accentuated in interorganizational contexts such as in tele- communications network and IT standards setting. The litera- ture has shown that besides economic returns from the decision to share technology costs, perceptions about the fairness of the sharing arrangement affect whether individual decision makers accept or reject the arrangement (Tabibnia and Lieberman 2007). Fairness and unfairness have been two important issues in studies of human decision making that often bring into play both emotional and cognitive brain processes. In the cognitive neuroscience literature, Sanfey et al. (2003) used fMRI to identify the neural correlates of the processes involved in decision making when subjects played the Ultimatum game. Unfair offers activated the insular cortex (a highly emotional area) and the DLPFC (a highly cognitive area). Activation in the insular cortex predicted whether a person might reject an offer (while the DLPFC did not), testifying to the role of emotional processes in economic</page><page sequence="13">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research decision making. In contrast, Knoch et al. (2006) proposed that the DLPFC is associated with rejecting unfair offers or punishing unfair behavior by showing that subjects with temporarily disrupted activity in the right DLPFC (using TMS) were more likely to accept unfair offers in the Ultimatum game. These findings testify to the role of both cognitive and emotional processes when judging fair and unfair offers. Moral and social values temper the role of material effects and self-interest in influencing human deci- sions. Neurophysiological tools analyzing activation in emotional and cognitive regions of the brain at the individual level can shed light on what organizational incentives will lead to acceptance or rejection of technology investment proposals by promoting perception of fairness. In another fMRI study, Tabibnia and Lieberman (2009) showed that fair offers increased activity in the reward areas (ventral striatum) of the brain compared to unfair offers with the same monetary value. It is possible that these findings can be used to design incentives for technology decision makers by attempting to maximize the activation in the reward areas of the brain under different compensation schemes. Also, Dulebohn et al. (2009) showed that unfair outcomes activated the anterior insular cortex and DLPFC (similar to Sanfey et al. 2003) while unfair procedures triggered both the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus. The authors distinguished between procedural and distributive justice as distinct constructs whose neural correlates reside in different brain areas. Decision makers may find the conduct of the process or the outcome of that process, or both, to be unfair. These findings testify to the importance of emotional responses to unfair offers relative to activating the brain's reward areas for material outcomes. However, hormones, such as serotonin, modulate behavioral reactions to unfairness (Crockett et al. 2008). Clearly, the neuroscience literature can provide guidance in designing incentives that go beyond material rewards to ensure that technology-related decisions are made to enhance the organization's broader interest. Group Work and Decision Support The proposed research opportunities on group work and deci- sion support focus on (1) enhancing online group collabora- tion, (2) designing online decision aids, and (3) understanding and building online trust. Enhancing Online Group Collaboration and Decision Support We propose a set of opportunities on enhancing group col- laboration, summarized in Table 9. First, a major problem in group work is that people often fail to incorporate the comments of others into their own thinking, which often results in poor decisions (Dennis 1996). It is unclear whether this is due to a lack of attention or due to a deliberate choice to disregard others, although some research suggests that it may be due to a lack of attention (Heninger et al. 2006). Attention has been examined extensively in the neuroscience literature, and several findings about the neural and physiological correlates of attention have been identified. The dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices have been associated with attention in fMRI studies (Knudsen 2007). Psychophysiological tools, such as EEG, EKG, and SCR, can be used to measure emotion, attention, and arousal when group members engage in collaborative activities, thus testing whether group members fail to attend to information or deli- berately discount information from others. Once the cause of the problem has been identified with the aid of neurophysio- logical tools, collaborative technologies and process interven- tions to improve group decision making could be designed. Second, another objective of collaborative group work is often to promote cooperation and to prevent competition among group members. Neuroimaging tools can be used to design interventions that enable or prevent the neural cor- relates of collaboration and competition, respectively (Decety et al. 2004). The design of collaborative technologies could include interventions that facilitate in-group collaboration and prevent in-group competition. Such IT designs could be tested with fMRI to verify their ability in enhancing activity in the neural correlates associated with collaboration and reduce activity in the brain areas associated with competition (inferior parietal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex). In addition, physiological tools such as fEMG could capture users' reactions when collaborative technologies are used to prevent negative reactions in group interaction. Such direct and objective tests using neurophysiological tools could then be used to help refine the design of collaborative technologies and implement them in actual group settings. Third, it is well known that lean digital media such as e-mail have a smaller number of cues than audio or video. It has recently been argued that communication through such lean media is inherently biased, leading people to sense a more negative tone in e-mail (Byron 2008) and reducing their feeling of cooperati veness. Neurophysiological tools could assess emotional responses to e-mail (and other media) mes- sages, thus enabling a better understanding of whether lean digital media is indeed more negatively biased than other, richer media. If so, IS researchers could strive to understand aspects that lead to this bias and find solutions to address them.

Designing IT tools that help secondary tasks become automated, to enable group members to dedicate their full attention to primary tasks. 6. Testing how dual-task interference can be mitigated with collaborative IT tools. Finally, physiological measures could be complemented with brain imaging tools for assessing alternative measures of attention. For instance, deficits in attention can be due to secondary tasks that disrupt a person's attention to primary tasks. Indeed, the neuroscience literature has shown that if a secondary task becomes automated, dual-task interference is reduced and distinct brain areas are associated with conscious versus automated task processing (Kunde et al. 2007). These findings could be used to design collaborative technologies that help secondary tasks become fully automated, thus enabling group members to dedicate their full attention to primary tasks. Automaticity and habit have been primarily linked to two brain areas (medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia) (e.g., Graybiel 2008; Kubler et al. 2006), making it possible to test whether dual-task interference can be mitigated with the aid of collaborative technologies. Designing Online Decision Aids We also discuss three research opportunities for designing decision aids in online markets (Table 10). Decision aids are integral components of online markets, and the IS literature has focused on designing decision aids in the form of recommendation agents to help to enhance decision making in online markets (e.g., Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2005; Xiao and Benbasat 2007). Similar to system and website adoption, the design of decision aids could also be informed by the use of neurophysiological tools. One set of studies can focus on how decision aids can be designed to give consumers advice related to sensitive issues, such as sexual habits, diseases, and drugs. Since consumers are likely to be embarrassed when dealing with such sensitive issues, decision aids could be designed to create rapport with 692 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 consumers and enable them to answer sensitive questions by reducing embarrassment (e.g., Al-Natour et al. 2009). In that subjects may not admit anxiety via self reports, neurophysio- logical tools may uncover such emotions. The neuroscience literature has made much progress in identifying the neural correlates of many emotional processes (Murphy et al. 2003; Phan et al. 2002), that can be used to identify which emotions the sensitive questions trigger. Neurophysiological studies can ask the subject questions with different levels of sensi- tivity and embarrassment while observing brain activation. These patterns of brain activation can be used to understand how people respond to sensitive issues, and this knowledge can be used to design decision aids that would enable consumers to truthfully respond to sensitive questions and receive valuable personal advice. Although IT artifacts, such as systems or websites, are not associated with an anthropomorphic element, decision aids in the form of recommendation agents often include a humanoid face (avatar), which plays a role in their adoption (Qiu and Benbasat 2009). The neuroscience literature has studied how people respond to various faces, and these findings can be used to inform the design of decision aids with a human interface. Because these interfaces are associated with a certain ethnicity and gender, their adoption may depend on the ethnicity/gender the avatar was designed to have and the user's ethnicity and gender, as predicted by theories of similarity. Qiu and Benbasat (20 1 0) found differences across consumers in terms of how they use recommendation agents that differ on their ethnicity and gender, but the behavioral data could not fully explain these differences, perhaps because social desirability bias prevented users from admitting that they favor avatar interfaces of the same eth- nicity and gender. Because one of the basic advantages of neurophysiological tools is to get direct responses that are not biased by subjectivity and social desirability, brain activity</page><page sequence="15">Dimoka et ai/Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research Application Sampie Research Opportunities 1 .

Understanding and Building Online Trust Neurophysiological tools can help better understand the nature and dynamics of trust and distrust and how systems can be designed to help build trust online, as summarized in Table 1 1 and discussed in detail below. First, trust and its related distrust are complex social processes that affect many group processes. Still, the study of trust, and even more so distrust, has only scratched the surface of these rich group processes. For example, the dimensions of ability, integrity, and benevolence statistically combine to form over- all trust (Gefen et al. 2003; Gefen et al. 2010). The dimen- sions of trust are inter-related (Mayer et al. 1995), but why they mostly combine into an overall factor when they deal with distinct aspects of trust is still unknown. Neurophysio- logical tools could possibly shed light on this issue by examining how these interrelated trust dimensions, such as credibility and benevolence (Pavlou and Dimoka 2006), reside in the brain. This might be done experimentally by manipulating dimensions of trust to create or to ruin assess- ments of ability, credibility, and benevolence, and in doing so, identify the activation pattern of their neural correlates. Second, knowing the neural correlates of trust could shed light on trust formation. If neurophysiological tools can clearly show that these dimensions of trust indeed have distinct neural correlates, IS researchers could design systems that separately affect each dimension of trust. For example, advice-giving systems may provide different information about each dimension of trust (Wang and Benbasat 2007). Prior IS research argued that integrity and ability precede benevolence without explaining why (Jarvenpaa et al. 1998). Neurophysiological tools may be able to answer this question, and indeed initial steps in this direction have already been taken by Dimoka (2010), who identified the neural correlates of trust as the caudate nucleus (confident expectations about anticipated rewards) (King-Casas et al. 2005), anterior para- cingulate cortex (predicting how the trustee will act in the future) (McCabe et al. 2001), and orbitofrontal cortex (uncer- tainty from the trustor's willingness to be vulnerable) (Krain et al. 2006). Riedl et al. (2010b) identified another area related to reward processing, namely the thalamus, replicating Baumgartner et al. (2008). These findings shed light on the formation of trust and could guide the design of IT tools to build different trust dimensions. Third, neurophysiological tools can also help examine how other constructs related to trust such as familiarity, satisfac- tion, and trust propensity help build trust. The IS literature has shown that familiarity and trust propensity build trust gradually (Gefen 2000). This is consistent with the neural correlates of trust where brain areas such as the anterior paracingulate cortex (associated with the trustor's predictions of the trustee's actions) have a more enduring nature than brain areas associated with calculating uncertainty (orbito- frontal cortex) and anticipating rewards (caudate nucleus) (Dimoka 2010). Future research could study how familiarity MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 693</page><page sequence="16">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research with the trustee and with trust propensity shape the neural correlates of trust over time, thus extending the IS literature on trust by better integrating familiarity with trust formation. Fourth, besides examining the nature of trust, neurophysio- logical tools could identify antecedents of trust by studying how systems (e.g., websites) and IT-enabled signals and incentives (e.g., third-party assurances) activate the identified neural correlates of trust. It is already known that website and advice-giving systems can build trust (Lim et al. 2006; Wang and Benbasat 2007); however, little is known about what actually happens as the brain analyzes different trust-building stimuli. Particular antecedents of trust (e.g., feedback sys- tems, reputation signals, design cues) could be tested to identify areas of brain activation. Using the elaboration likelihood model, Kim and Benbasat (2009, 2010) showed that trust-assuring arguments are more effective when people have high product involvement while third-party assurances are more effective in building trust when product involvement is low. However, product involvement and central versus peripheral information processing are difficult to measure with traditional tools, creating another opportunity for neuro- physiological tools to complement existing tools. Such studies may identify different trust-building processes by showing activity in the caudate nucleus (increase in potential rewards from trust), or anterior paracingulate cortex (pre- dicting that the trustee will act cooperatively), or orbitofrontal cortex (reduction in uncertainty). Such studies might, in fact, complement existing findings about the reasoning processes that people use to build trust (Komiak and Benbasat 2008; Wang and Benbasat 2008). Fifth, neurophysiological tools could also examine the temporal dynamics among the dimensions of trust, helping IS research delve more deeply into trust formation. fMRI tools, with their superior spatial resolution, coupled with MEG or EEG, with their superior temporal resolution, could be used together to examine the temporal ordering of the activations in the brain areas associated with trust (Dimoka 2010). Such studies could inform us as to whether and when people focus on the vulnerability associated with trust, rewards, and inferring the trustee's actions. These findings could inform the design of IT-enabled trust-building stimuli. Finally, neurophysiological tools might challenge existing assumptions in the trust literature. For example, Dimoka (2010) showed that distrust is not the opposite of trust, but rather is a distinct construct that is linked to distinct brain areas associated with fear of loss (insular cortex) and intense emotions (amygdala). This may explain Wang and Ben- basat' s (2008) findings where they showed that knowledge- based processes (via explanations) affect trust but not distrust in advice-giving systems while "awareness of the unknown" 694 MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 about the reasoning of such IT systems leads users to form distrust beliefs (Komiak and Benbasat 2008). This also helps explain Pavlou and Dimoka's (2006) findings that benev- olence (which is associated with emotional areas) is more influential on price premiums than credibility (which is associated with cognitive brain areas). Discussion The discussion first offers recommendations for pursuing NeuroIS by using neurophysiological tools to complement the existing portfolio of empirical IS approaches, tools, and data. Second, we discuss how to establish NeuroIS as a viable subfield in IS research that can contribute and add value to the IS literature. Recommendations for Pursuing NeuroIS Research First and foremost, it is important to clarify that NeuroIS is not a panacea for all IS research issues, and our objective is simply to propose some promising avenues for IS research with neurophysiological tools. Although we do not seek to exclude any IS areas from using neurophysiological tools, we hasten to add that there may be several areas of IS research that neurophysiological tools could offer little or even no help. Second, IS researchers must assess when to use neuro- physiological tools and when existing tools are sufficient. A rule-of-thumb is that when existing tools can adequately measure a research question, neurophysiological tools may not be necessary. As Izak Benbasat noted during a 2009 INFORMS panel "NeuroIS if necessary, but not necessarily NeuroIS." Thus, there must be a good rationale for using neurophysiological tools (Kosslyn 1999), such as using neurophysiological data to supplement existing sources of data or to address an issue that could not be adequately examined with existing tools. Third, despite the proposed advantages of neurophysiological measures, no single neurophysiological measure is usually sufficient on its own, and it is advisable to use many data sources to triangulate across measures, which is always advisable in IS research (e.g., Straub et al. 2004). On the one hand, when there is a good correspondence between existing data and neurophysiological data, we may infer that existing data and resulting models closely correspond to the human or brain functionality, thus validating and rendering higher confidence to existing theories. However, there is seldom a</page><page sequence="17">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research one-to-one correspondence between a neurophysiological measure and a theoretical construct (Huettel and Payne 2009), and it is important to treat neurophysiological measures merely as proxies for complex theoretical concepts (similar to all measures). Therefore, caution should be raised when the correlation between psychometric and neurophysiological data are extremely high (Vul et al. 2009), and such correla- tions are not an artifact of the measurement method (Saxe et al. 2006). On the other hand, if there is a poor correspon- dence across neurophysiological and existing data, such a low correspondence does not necessarily imply that one measure is necessarily "better" than the other. This is because valida- tion across measures is "symmetrical and egalitarian" (Camp- bell 1960, p. 548). Taken together, it is important to trian- gulate across many different sources of data, and the richness provided by multiple sources of measures can be used to enhance the ecological validity of IS studies. Fourth, similar to all studies with human subjects, neuro- physiological studies require approval by the researcher's institutional review board. Depending on the institution and use of particular neurophysiological tools by prior investi- gators, the time and effort needed may differ. Still, most studies with neurophysiological tools qualify for an expedited review, similar to behavioral studies such as surveys. Fifth, as also noted by Dimoka et al. (2007), the field of NeuroIS does not need to grow exclusively with neuro- physiological studies. There is a very rich literature in neuro- science in the social sciences (Dimoka et al. 2011) that IS researchers can draw upon to inform their theories. Once the field of NeuroIS is established, neuropsychological tools become more accessible, and clear guidelines for NeuroIS studies agreed upon, it will become increasingly easier to conduct empirical studies with neurophysiological tools. Finally, IS researchers should conduct a cost-benefit analysis when using neurophysiological tools. Each tool has different strengths and weaknesses that must be assessed relative to their costs (Appendix A). Toward a Viable NeuroIS Subfield of IS Research As noted in many of the examples offered in this paper, the value of NeuroIS largely lies in combining neurophysiological data with other sources of data. The benefit of any new tool lies in how it works together with, draws upon, and com- plements existing tools, and neurophysiological tools are no exception. It needs to be emphatically stated that neuro- physiological tools should not be seen as an attempt to replace, but rather to complement and supplement existing IS tools. Integrating neurophysiological data with other sources of data should be an important goal of NeuroIS. The litera- ture has generally shown high correlations between brain and psychometric measures (Vul et al. 2009), and there is a debate about whether correlations are artificially inflated due to characteristics of the focal statistical methods (e.g., Lieber- man et al. 2009). Future research is needed to assess the true extent of these correlations for different IS constructs, varying from purely cognitive to highly emotional ones. Potential differences in the extent of these correlations may shed light on the value of neurophysiological data versus other sources of data in measuring IS constructs. Nonetheless, differences between neurophysiological and existing measures should not necessarily imply that either approach is better, but it may imply that there is a need for cross-validation to measure complex IS constructs that are hard to capture accurately with a single data source. Differences between neurophysiological and self-reported data may imply that either respondents are unwilling or unable to self-report certain constructs, or simply that the human body simply cannot represent the richness of psychometric measures (Logothetis 2008). Another promising role of neurophysiological tools is to inform debates that cannot be fully resolved with existing tools. Many of the examples offered in this paper revolve around identifying the distinction, convergence, and dimen- sionality of IS constructs that are still unresolved in the IS literature. Furthermore, competing theories can be resolved with neurophysiological tools that may help explain which theory is more likely to correspond to the body's func- tionality. For example, Dimoka (2010) has tackled the still unanswered question of whether trust and distrust are distinct constructs or whether they are part of the same continuum. In her study, the fMRI results showed that trust and distrust are associated with the activation of different brain areas, thus offering evidence that they are two distinct constructs associated with different neurological processes. Neuro- physiological tools may uncover new constructs that have been ignored in the IS literature (perhaps because they could not be adequately measured), thus enriching IS theories. Moreover, neurophysiological tools can help exclude con- structs that do not correspond to the body's functionality, resulting in more parsimonious IS theories and helping to develop better IS theories. Because neurophysiological tools have the inherent attraction of being able to open the black box of the human brain and many studies have numerous interesting findings, there may be a rush among IS researchers to conduct NeuroIS studies without developing adequate knowledge of the neuroscience literature and sufficient expertise with neurophysiological tools. It is thus necessary to devise guidelines for conducting NeuroIS studies. As with other statistical and methodological MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 3/September 2012 695</page><page sequence="18">Dimoka et al. /Use of Neurophysiological Tools in IS Research tools already adopted in IS research, such as LISREL, PLS, HLM, case studies (e.g., Benbasat et al. 1987), and experi- ments (e.g., Jarvenpaa et al. 1985), neurophysiological tools need to develop their own quality controls and best practices (Straub et al. 1994). Specialized NeuroIS symposia (e.g., Dimoka et al. 2010b; Riedl et al. 2010a), conference panels (e.g., Dimoka et al. 2009a; Dimoka et al. 2009b; Dimoka et al. 2010a), and tutorials (Dimoka 2009) could help promote NeuroIS. Moreover, it would be useful to include NeuroIS as a topic in IS doctoral seminars and have dedicated doctoral courses and seminars that review NeuroIS studies, offer empirical guidelines on neurophysiological tools (Dimoka 2012), and discuss promising NeuroIS topics. Moreover, given the cost requirements of neurophysiological tools, sponsoring NeuroIS studies is a challenging task, and creating a support structure to facilitate IS researchers to obtain funding would also help promote NeuroIS. Finally, including editors and reviewers with expertise in cognitive neuroscience theories and neurophysiological tools would enable NeuroIS studies in IS journals to be rigorously reviewed, thus ensuring that only high-quality studies are published in major IS journals. Conclusion Establishing NeuroIS as a viable subfield in IS research must focus on promising opportunities to enhance IS research, promote specialized events, establish and disseminate best practices, secure funding, and build a community of NeuroIS scholars. While IS researchers are initially encouraged to borrow neuroscience theories and benefit from existing knowledge on using neurophysiological tools, they must eventually contribute to this emerging literature by offering a unique NeuroIS perspective. For example, localizing the neural correlates of IT-related constructs could be a good starting point to add value to the neuroscience literature. Also, how people interact with computers (HCl) and websites (e-commerce) could be prime areas where NeuroIS could provide value. Above and beyond identifying potential appli- cations for research that has yet to be conducted, we hope this paper entices NeuroIS researchers to be both intelligent consumers and also diligent contributors to the rapidly expanding neuroscience literature.
