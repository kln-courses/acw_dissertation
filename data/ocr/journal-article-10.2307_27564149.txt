In that article, I envisaged the possibility that a hitherto latent fragment from Tereus may be culled out of Leucippe 5.5.4 ehva tojv ydpicov avTjj SiSojgi pirjK Ti XaXe?v, namely: &lt;x ? u ? x ? u&gt; eSva tcov ydpiwv SlScooiv avTjj par) ti yrjpveiv en SiScoaiv avTjj \xrj ti yrjpveiv en was suggested to me by David Kovacs per litteras? Unfortunately his suggestion was garbled in transmission, and in the printed article the second line begins avTfj SiS oiv. This cannot be right since the unemphatic or anaphoric forms of avTos (ovtov, etc.) are not found in line-initial position. I wish to make it clear that Professor Kovacs, whose contributions to Greek tragedy are many and distinguished, is not responsible for this blemish. It now strikes me that another tragic reminiscence, possibly also from Sophocles' Tereus, may be detected in Leucippe 5.3.5 Sp?? 6 Trjpevs ivv(j&gt;avTo OiXopirjXa TraXa?ojv iraXrjv ?c?poSioiov. The association of violent or illicit sexual congress with wrestling brings to mind two Aeschylean passages in which the metaphor is prominent. The first is Agamemnon 1206 where Apollo is called TraXaioTrjs in his capacity as Cassandra's lover. The second is Supplices 296, where TraXaiopiaTa is Butler's emendation - accepted by M.L. West in his Teubner edition - of the nonsensical MS TraXXaypi?TOJv (cf. TraXaiopiaTcov already Stanley). Hermann's TapiTraX?ypiaTa, which was more or less the vulgate before West,3 has been shown by Friis Johansen and Whittle to be more dubious than its nearly universal acceptance might suggest: The word ipnraX?ypiaTa cannot mean 'embraces', but denotes 'entanglement', as Headlam points out in his translation. Headlam himself explains it as 'liaison, an entanglement in the snares of love' [...] but this idea cannot be conveyed by the bare subst.; the abstract sense liaison is perhaps possible [...] but is hardly what the context requires.4 West5 has made a strong case for Butler's emendation, and adduced numerous non-tragic parallels (from the Theognidea down to Paulus Silentiarius) for the idea of * I am grateful to David Kovacs for his truly valuable help with this paper, and to the CQ editors for giving me this opportunity to set the record straight regarding a textual suggestion by Professor Kovacs which I had unfortunately misreported in an earlier article (see below in the text). Naturally, whatever faults remain are entirely my own responsibility. 1 CQ 56.1 (2006) 220-38. 2 As indicated in CQ (n. 1), 224. 3 Wecklein, Headlam, Mazon, Weir Smyth; rdpnraXdypiar} rjv Wilamowitz, V?rtheim, Murray, Rose, Page.

However, as a look at n. 6 will confirm, use of wrestling-imagery to refer to the sexual act is rare: it is rather images of fighting or of training and exercising that prevail. Moreover, aside from Paulus Silentiarius, the use of rr?Xaiopia, rraXaiorrjs and the like as euphemisms for sex seems to be limited to Aeschylus. In addition, TraXrjv ?(j)po8loiov in Achilles Tatius contains an epithet which in tragedy occurs only in Sophocles (fr. 166 Radt K?(f&gt;po8iolav aypav). It is not beyond belief, then, that Leucippe 5.3.5 may conceal a reminiscence of a tragic trimeter, e.g. x ? rraXalwv ?(f&gt;po8loiov rr?Xrjv (Kovacs per litteras), which would preserve Tatius' phraseology practically intact. There may, however, be a difficulty here, in that the only tragic instance of ?c/)po8ioios that is metrically unambiguous, namely S. fr. 277.1 Radt, scans with short first syllable (in S. fr. 166 the word is in crasi). This is, of course, no fatal objection per se, considering that A(f&gt;po8lrrj sometimes has a long first syllable (E. Ba. 225, 459; IA 1159; fr. 23.2, 26.1, 898,1 Kannicht). However, since Sophocles does not seem to use rr?Xrj (fr. 1130.10 Radt is of uncertain authorship), a reconstruction involving rr?Xaiopia might have more to recommend it. The putative Sophoclean original could have been e.g. ?cf)po8ioloioiv epnrXaKels rraXalopiaoiv (the three-word trimeter may have attracted attention to a climactic moment), or perhaps ?(/)po8loiov rr?Xaiopia rr)8y errepL?aXojv. There are, of course, numerous other possibilities. Universit? de Montr?al VAYOS J.
