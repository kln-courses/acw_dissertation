The core concept in such a philosophy of culture is the symbolic formation that both possesses a structured-structuring dimension and appears as an historical process in which culture shows itself as a temporal creation. The philosophy of cul- ture displays 'life in meaning', that is reality as it exhibits human reality manifested in and through the medium of linguistic, artistic, religious, scientific "and so on" action and behaviour. This reality, therefore, is mediation between culture and nature through human spirit. Cassirer's philosophy of culture connects back to Kant's transcendental idealism by emphasizing that any concept of reality establishes itself through a modal- ization of reality, e.g. that reality constitutes itself in the mode of interpretation. This makes the basis for Cassirer's characteristic understanding of hermeneutics where cultural development is regarded as drama. Keywords Cassirer • Philosophy of culture • Formation • Hermeneutics • Development • Drama • Kant • Transcendental philosophy It is clear that Ernst Cassirer made the topic of culture an express object of his obser- vations and examinations. Starting in the late thirties, the term "culture" appears in the titles of several of his publications. Cassirer began this trend while in Swedish exile in 1939 with an essay on the naturalistic and humanistic grounding of the philosophy of culture.

In 1944, An Essay on Man , subtitled An Introduction to a Philosophy of Human Culture , appeared in English while Cassirer was exiled in America.1 What becomes apparent only upon closer reading, however, is that from the start of his career Cassirer strongly embraced what one generally calls 'culture.' He had neither to discover the constituent matter nor the concept of 'culture' himself; he lived in the sphere of the colloquial, which became increasingly dominant after the second half of the nineteenth century, and his early Berlin teacher, Georg Simmel, was a persuasive and deliberate proponent of it.2 Cassirer first uses the term culture in a title in "Critical Idealism as a Philosophy of Culture," a posthumously published lecture that he gave in London on May 26, 1936 at the transplanted "Warburg Library" of Hamburg, the "Warburg Institute."3 Yet already in 1923 Cassirer had programmatically declared in the first volume of his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms : "the critique of reason becomes the critique of culture."4 The title of the lecture incidentally recalls Wilhelm Windelband's Prälu- dien essay of 1910, "Kulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus."5 Cassirer, however, seems uninterested in the resemblance. At the close of the talk he instead describes to his London audience his own encounter with a true "universe of culture," on the occasion of his first visit to the Warburg Library in Hamburg in 1920. He reports that its holdings and the manner of their presentation helped his ideas to become con- crete after carrying them around around for years, namely to work out a "grammar and syntax of the human spirit," i.e. to expose the structure of culture, as he then of course sought to do in his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms.6 Such culture is a concrete world, a human world, and - alluding to Heraclitus7 - a "common world," woven through with human activity and its creations. It is the world of the human being. Cassirer states in his lecture that culture is not a merely speculative thing and cannot be based on merely speculative grounds. It does not only consist of a system of theoretical suppositions; it demands a system of actions. Culture means a whole of verbal and moral activi- ties; of such activities as are not only conceived in an abstract way, but have the constant tendency and the energy of realization. It is this realization, this con- struction and reconstruction of the empirical world, that is involved in the very concept of culture and that makes up one of the essential and most characteristic features.8 1 Cassirer (1993b, 1972,2000). 2 Cf.

The world is manifest to the human being, as is the problem of the "knowledge of reality" [Wirklichkeitserkenntnis].9 The works that Cassirer produced in the twenties (into the early thirties) in connection with the lecture and publication series of the Warburg Library in Hamburg contain paradig- matic insights into this world and its structures. These include essays such as "Die Begriffsform im mythischen Denken" (1922), "Eidos und Eidolon. Das Problem des Schönen und der Kunst in Piatons Dialogen" (1922/23), "Sprache und Mythos. Ein Beitrag zum Problem der Götternamen" (1925; translated as Language and Myth), and "Shaftesbury und die Renaissance des Platonismus in England" (1930/31), along with the books Individuum und Kosmos in der Philosophie der Renaissance (1927; translated as The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy ) and Die Pla- tonische Renaissance in England und die Schule von Cambridge (1932; translated as The Platonic Renaissance in England ).10 That Cassirer's concern is with concrete cultural scientific research, that is, research in cultural science and the arts and humanities, developing in parallel with a systematic Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923/25/29), is already shown in the title of his first contribution to the Vorträge der Bibliothek Warburg lecture series (1920/21), "Der Begriff der symbolischen Form im Aufbau der Geisteswissenschaften."11 This title also shows that Cassirer is not at all fixed in his terminology; for what here is called "science(s) of spirit" [Geistes wissenschaft(en)], could for all intents and purposes also be called "science(s) of culture" [Kulturwissenschaft(en)]. Cassirer still uses the term "science of spirit" in both the singular and the plural in his later period, when culture, philosophy of culture, and science of culture all appear in titles. Cassirer addresses the topic of culture in a chapter headed "Zur Logik der Geisteswissenschaften" in his 1939 Göteburg treatise on Axel Hägerström, a critique of naturalism.12 According to Cassirer, knowledge of human culture "is the concern of the science of spirit."13 Note here his unconcerned shift between the plural and singular of 'science of spirit.' Cassirer expressly acknowledges Dilthey's attempt at "a general 'structural theory' of the sciences of spirit" in the sense of a "critique of his- torical reason." But Cassirer's critical reservation is that Dilthey is "presently still held by the spell" of a certain "positivism and psychologism," in starting from the "concept of 'experience'" instead of attempting "a new, 'objective' construction." However, "Dilthey's own investigations [ ...] concerning the structure of historical reality rep- resent a very important and substantial contribution" to the logic of the sciences of spirit.14 Structure is a key concept here. The term 'science of spirit' is acceptable, along with 'cultural science,' so long as one does not take 'spirit' [Geist] to mean the epitome of "feelings" [Gefühle] and hence to simply "hang about in the sphere 9 Cf. Cassirer (2000, pp. 12, 56). On the role of this topos, see Cassirer (1999). 10 Cassirer (1924, 1946, 1953b, 1956b, 1964, 2004). 1 1 Cassirer (1956a). Cf. also Cassirer (1953a), where on p. V of the foreword there is express mention of "a foundation" [Grundlegung] of the sciences of spirit. 12 Cassirer (1939). 13 Cassirer (1939, p. 114). 14 Cassirer (1939, pp. 113, 114). â Springer</page><page sequence="4">118 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 of subjective conditions and be satisfied with their description."15 "But the object of analysis here" - regarding spirit and the sciences of spirit - "is of course different in kind from material things, whose constitution and whose relations natural science strives to know. We have here to do not with things, but with forms [ . . .] Certainly all of these forms are bound to 'matter,' to particular physical things and events, and their external appearance depends solely on these. Human culture, the knowledge of which is the concern of the science of spirit, does not present itself separately of its mate- rial moments and monuments, namely in what is captured in speech and writing, in the depictions of the fine arts, in equipment and tools, in buildings, and so on. Yet all of this becomes meaningful to us only once it is interpreted, when it is 'laid out' in the proper way. And it is evident that empirical psychology, which seeks to analyze our ideas, feelings, and drives and to uncover their conditions for emergence, is not adequate to this task. We must understand the world of forms of language, art, religion, law, and so on as such , if we wish to penetrate into the meaning of individual linguistic, artistic, and religious creations. One of the essential tasks of philosophy is to accomplish this and to thereby move from the 'facts' of the sciences of spirit to their 'principles,' to their 'conditions of possibility.'16 Cassirer expressly points out that he attempted to give the "foundation for this view" in his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms}1 The 'philosophy of symbolic forms' is hence also a 'logic of the sciences of spirit' ! This is certainly plausible, given that the terms 'science of culture' and 'science of spirit' are used synonymously in the texts of The Logic of the Cultural Sciences. Occasionally, "the foundation of the sciences of cul- ture" and "logic of the sciences of spirit" appear on the same page of text.18 Vico on the other hand claims having formed "the logic of the science of culture" out of "the logic of language, poetry, and history."19 And while in his Hägerström treatise Cassirer in passing calls the 'analysis of form' that the sciences of spirit are to achieve "phenomenology," in The Logic of the Cultural Sciences he posits such phenomenol- ogy to be the explicit task of the 'science(s) of culture.' The psychologist Karl Bühler is praised in the Hägerström treatise for pushing the "experience of meaning" to the fore, in the face of conventional descriptions of subjective conditions,20 and hence for hitting upon the problem of form. This is the sense of "life in 'meanings'" [das Leben in 'Bedeutungen'] given prominence in The Logic of the Cultural Sciences.21 One can compare this sense to what Cassirer calls "a life 'in' meaning" [ein Leben 'im' Sinn] 15 Cassirer (1939, p. 114). 16 Cassirer (1939, p. 114). 17 Cassirer (1939, 114ff). 18 Cassirer (2000, pp. 22, 23). 19 Cassirer (2000, p. 10). 20 Cassirer (1939, p. 1 17). This includes exposing the "function of representation." 21 Cassirer (2000, p. 25). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 119 in the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms , meant to serve as the elementary paradigm of all culture.22 Given that the longer quotation above makes reference to 'interpreting,' to 'laying out,' and to 'life in meaning,' the term hermeneutics is also relevant. But here - in the Hägerström treatise in particular - Cassirer has decided on an analysis of form (also an 'analysis of structure') that is 'phenomenology.' In the second study of The Logic of the Cultural Sciences , "The Perception of Things and the Perception of Expression," too, there is talk of a "phenomenological analysis."23 In the third study, "Concepts of Nature and Concepts of Culture," the theory of forms is linked with Husserl 's concepts of the "ideal unity of signification" [idealen Bedeutungseinheit] and of the "ideational abstraction" [ideirenden Abstraktion].24 Cassirer introduces the term 'hermeneutics,' incidentally, in the fourth of his Five studies , "The Problem of Form and the Problem of Cause," and he defines it very specifically there.25 Before this special use of the concept of hermeneutics is discussed more in depth, it is necessary to remark on a peculiarity of Cassirer's view and way of speaking. Three moments can be identified. (1) A certain terminological flexibility, as for example announced in the seeming or in fact synonymous use of terms such as 'philosophy of culture,' 'science of culture,' and 'science of spirit.' The synonymy of these several different expres- sions seems to correspond to the homonymy of individual expressions (as for instance the expression 'expression' itself).26 (2) The differentiation and simultaneous unification of constituent matters. The "cosmos of culture" is counterpoised to the "cosmos of nature" - as culture is counterpoised to nature. However, while they are two 'symbolic universes,' each is only one of the directions of the 'symbolic universe' as a whole, which is, according to the conception of the philosophy of symbolic forms, in the end one cultural universe and which includes natural science as a symbolic form.27 One can surely consider natural science, insofar as it is a symbolic form, to be a phenomenon of culture. Can one then also consider 'nature' to be at least a limit concept of culture? (3) The terminology employed speaks on the one hand to a kind of systematic integrity, on the other it is historically inherited. This goes especially for the leading concepts themselves - such as culture, nature, and spirit. Set off by this 22 Cassirer (1957, p. 202). 23 Cassirer (2000, 42ff). 24 Cassirer (2000, pp. 65, 72). Cf. also Cassirer (1955, p. 12 n. 7), where Cassirer remarks on the achieve- ment of Husserlian phenomenology to conduct adequate research on "cultural 'structural forms'" - e.g., myth - through "purely ideational analysis." 25 Cassirer (2000, p. 97), cf. further down p. 18ff. 26 'Expression' is on the one hand simply vitally manifested spiritual energy, on the other a very specific form of such manifestation. 27 Cf. Cassirer (2000, p. 20), where "ways and directions of our knowledge of the world" bring forth a type of "objectivity" that encompasses "not only the cosmos of nature but also that of culture." Cf. also Cassirer (1939, p. 119) on the one reality that receives its objectification through special kinds of "creation." On the 'symbolic universe,' cf. Cassirer (1972, p. 221). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">120 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 interplay is a basic attitude, which Cassirer is certainly aware of, but which he fails to provide a final systematic account of (perhaps because it is by defini- tion impossible). One can intuitively describe this basic attitude as follows. It is culture itself that generates (i.e. brings forth historically) the concept of culture and all of the concepts by means of which cultural matter is determined more closely and structured. It belongs to the "continued existence" [Bestand] of cul- ture that it is constituted by means of process, i.e. that it exists as a temporal creation [Zeitgestaltung].28 Symbolic formation possesses a structured-struc- turing dimension, and is also an historical process in which culture shows itself as a temporal creation. These three moments arise from the fundamental matter of culture, which Cassirer takes to be an ineluctable reality. He calls it 'life in meaning.' Occasionally there is also mention of a "basic phenomenon" [Urphänomen]. This basic phenomenon is the reality of meaning, not a simple brute fact, but a reality, e.g., human reality, which man- ifests itself through the medium of linguistic, artistic, religious "and so on" (!) action and behavior, i.e. being somehow expressive of meaning. It is the "function" (!) of lan- guage, of art, of religion "and so on" that Cassirer here calls the basic phenomenon,29 though only insofar as this function has real effects on real things (and is not merely a hypostatized formula). A paradigm of this basic phenomenon is the human being himself as " animal symbolicum provided that, with his both sensuous and sensible, i.e. both body and soul or both physical and spiritual constitution he can count as the "prototype and the model for a purely symbolic relation."30 The characteristic of this reality of meaning (even in its still very elementary variations) is to be fundamentally self-referential in behavior and action, i.e. to be self-constituting and self-expressive. If we detect in such an elementary reality of meaning the first manifestation of culture, then it is clear that all further communication regarding culture, including scientific and philosophical communication, is culturally generated.31 The various concepts of communication regarding culture hence turn out to be differentiations within culture itself. The historical inheritance of the concepts is thus as legitimate as the seeming equivocation (homonymy and synonymy) of the culture-related terminology. "This appearance of a 'meaning,' which is not detached from the physical but is embodied by it and in it, is the factor common to all those contents that we denote by the term culture ." This is exactly what Cassirer wishes to underline in his linguistic portrayal.32 28 Cf. Cassirer (2000, pp. 33, 66, 100). Cf. Orth (2004e, pp. 29-147). The constitutive significance of the future for culture is already evident in Cassirer's early thesis that the human being - in autotelie - works "not from freedom, but toward freedom" f "nicht von der Freiheit aus, sondern auf die Freiheit hin"]. On this, see Cassirer (1912), especially p. 269. 29 Cassirer (2000, p. 99). On "symbolic pregnance," see Cassirer (1957, p. 202). 30 Cassirer (1957. d. 100). On the "animal svmbolicum " see Cassirer (1972, d. 26). 3 1 The Heideggerian conception of the "hermeneutics of Dasein " being on the one hand a structural char- acteristic of Dasein itself and on the other the scientific or philosophical analysis of Dasein - that is, being both genitivus subjectivus and as genitivus objectivus - parallels this view. 32 Cassirer (2000, p. 43). Cf. Cassirer (2000, p. 46) for the conclusion "that all linguistic expression is and remains 'metaphorical' expression." Cf. Orth (2004c). â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 121 Cultural science here signifies the objective (objectifying) inquiry into cultural subject matters that each allow themselves to be categorized along various dimen- sions or domains (cultural realms, forms, symbolic forms). Thus a proliferation of 'sciences of culture' is to be expected. 'Philosophy of culture' by contrast is con- cerned with the final, i.e. the foundational conditions and principles of culture (and therewith the cultural sciences); that is, it is to be "not only a certain kind of knowledge [Wissen] of the world but also the conscience [Gewissen] of human culture."33 How- ever, philosophy or philosophy of culture can only fulfill this function as conscience if it works closely with the individual cultural sciences and with concrete cultural life - for it is their conscience after all! Conversely, the cultural sciences risk degenerating into a naturalistic objectivism if their connection to philosophical conscience is cut. This conscience fundamentally has its roots, Cassirer states, in the primal vitality of the human understanding of self and world, in other words in the basic phenomenon of 'life in meaning' already mentioned. A paradigmatic variation of this "life in meaning" - a particularly successful form thereof - is that which Cassirer calls 'humanism,' and more particularly the so-called 'new humanism' that he sees at work in the eighteenth century between Goethe and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The point here is that as a historical form (or a historical content), 'new humanism' is awarded the systematic structuring function for culture as such - as explained in Cassirer's 1939 essay on the naturalistic and humanistic founding of the philosophy of culture.34 Certainly this concerns objectification, i.e. the general structuring of human understanding of the world. But this objectification can go awry objectively and reductionistically if its connection to the spiritual energies of the human being, which alone are generative of form, is cut. Whereas it is possible to conceive of the sciences and hence also the cultural sci- ences as symbolic forms or as moments of such forms, Cassirer states of philosophy (and so of the philosophy of culture) that it is not its own symbolic form. Posthumously published texts from the early forties explain that philosophy does not wish "to put another, higher form in place of the old forms, it does not wish to replace one symbolic form with another." "It does not make [...] a new symbolic form, nor found a new creative modality, but it grasps the earlier modalities as that which they are: peculiar symbolic forms."35 Briefly, philosophy (of culture) assumes the symbolic forms in order to demonstrate their validity; in this respect it relies on these forms, which are then each objectively determined by the cultural sciences. But this work of the cultural sciences, in order that it not be blind, must be conducted within the light of philosophy, which for its part would be empty were it not implemented in the cultural sciences.36 Cassirer illustrates the problem at issue with a Kantian phrase that he often and sometimes freely quotes. Kant's formula, "to spell out appearances [...] in order to 33 Cassirer (2000, p. 27). 34 Cf. Cassirer ( 1 993b). See also the two early works: Cassirer (1916, 1 92 1 ). 35 Cassirer (1995, pp. 264, 265). 36 Dilthey faces a similar problem; in order to do philosophy, the humanistic discipline (in the singular) of reflection, he requires the individual humanistic disciplines (plural) as instruments, which for their part are to be interpreted philosophically. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">122 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 be able to read them as experience,"37 aids Cassirer to properly assess differing meth- odological interpretations coming from the various sciences. In so doing, he often quotes Kant's "experience" (singular) as "experiences" (plural); this certainly inti- mates a change in Cassirer's concept of experience (in comparison to the Kantian), which has to do with the multi-faceted nature of his concept of culture. In his London lecture on the philosophy of culture, he again recalls Kant's phrase: "to use Kant's words of spelling out appearances in order to be able to read them as experiences." But in considering various symbolic forms alongside the co-presence of the wave- and particle theories in modern physics, Cassirer goes on to ponder whether one should not in general proceed from "different alphabets of thought."38 He at once amends the metaphor of the alphabet and of the plurality of alphabets to that of 'grammars' and of 'syntax,' so as to be able to talk of many grammars (of 'idioms' of language, art, science, etc.).39 Crucially, to Cassirer's mind the task of philosophy is not to test out alphabets or grammars - the sciences already do that. Its task is also not to invent new alphabets. Rather, its task is to make the comparison of different alphabets or gram- mars structurally visible and hence also their common origin in functioning human spiritual energies, energies that for their part are only detectable on the occasion of 'spelling out' appearances. In his 1942 study on "Concepts of Nature and Concepts of Culture," though, Cassirer reserves Kant's formula for the natural sciences (for which Kant surely meant it). "In Kant's expression," Cassirer writes, "natural science teaches us, 'to spell out phenomena in order to read them off as experiences' [!]; the science of cul- ture teaches us to interpret symbols in order to decipher their hidden meaning - in order to make the life from which they originally emerged visible again."40 Whether 'spelling out phenomena' or 'interpreting symbols' - both cases concern those func- tions whose functioning constitutes understanding of the world and hence the world, and also introduces spiritual energies. The manifested dimension of this functioning is called culture. Here is the point at which Cassirer can positively connect his cultural finding [Befund], the elementary reality of meaning (that initially reveals itself wholly apart from philosophical reflection, e.g. in art), with Kant's transcendental or critical ide- alism. In his London lecture "Critical Idealism as a Philosophy of Culture," Cassirer directly quotes Kant's definition of 'transcendental knowledge' from the В Introduc- tion of the Critique of Pure Reason : "I entitle transcendental all knowledge which is occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge [Erkenntnisart] of objects in so far as this mode of knowledge is to be possible a priori."41 "Erkenntnis- art" Cassirer translates as "mode of our cognition." True objectivity, Cassirer's Kant- inspired thesis states, is only secured through the problem of access [Zugangsproblem], 37 Kant (2003, A 314); also Prolegomena §30. 38 Cassirer (1979a, 75ff). 39 Cassirer (1979a, pp. 76, 90). On grammar and idioms cf. also Cassirer (1953a, p. 19). 40 Cassirer (2000, p. 86). 41 Kant (2003, Introduction В 25). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 123 i.e. not through the assumption of physical or hyper-physical substances. Objectiv- ity constitutes itself via "determination through various modes of knowing."42 What originally links critical and transcendental idealism with the topic of culture is the modalization of reality, which is brought into play in the conception of 'transcenden- tal' as a mode of knowledge. The modalization of reality means that reality constitutes itself in the mode of interpretations. The concept of constitution is thus imbued with a connotation of creativity. Such modalizing and constituting are sympathetic to the concept of culture.43 In his posthumously published texts on 'basic phenomena,' Cas- sirer clarifies this interpretation: "A concluding, fundamental way to try to understand the 'works' of culture - their peculiar kind of objectivity - is the method that Kant introduced into philosophy." It calls for "the fundamental turnabout [...] that Kant illustrated with the example of the Copernican revolution." It "asks about" the "mode of knowledge." "This concept of the 'mode of knowledge' should be understood in the broadest sense."44 In his London lecture, as well as in his essay "Zur Logik des Symbolbegriffs," Cas- sirer affirms Kant's demand that "the proud name of an Ontology" must "give place to the modest title of a mere Analytic of pure understanding."45 Cassirer thus shows him- self to be fully in agreement with an access to reality that foreshadows every ontology. But this analytic, by his estimation, cannot only relate to 'pure understanding'; it must rather investigate the whole area of concrete understandings of the world. Thus the 'critique of reason' has in fact become a 'critique of culture,' for the epitome of such understandings is culture. Closer focus on these concrete understandings of the world by the separate sciences, for whose analysis Kant provides key concepts of function, only occurs after Kant - via the development of the sciences of spirit in the nineteenth century, which according to Cassirer nonetheless received crucial motivation from Kant's Critique of Judgment.^ For Cassirer, the analysis of the constituting functions requires not only starting from the fact of the sciences (which incidentally is already a cultural fact for Cohen), but even more importantly starting from the fact of pre- and extra-scientific orientations towards the world, like for instance that of language, art or religion, whose scientific investigation or investigation by the individual sciences must certainly now also be taken into account. In addition, this 'fact' - whether it be scientific or whether it belong to some other understanding of the world - is an unending dynamic undertaking (Natorp). Cassirer's 'deduction' of the concept of culture, i.e. its placement within transcen- dental idealism, owes first to a particular interpretation of the Kantian 'transcendental deduction.' Cassirer derives the constituent matter and the concept of 'culture' episte- mologically or via the theory of knowledge. By contrast, the more scientific-theoretical 42 Cf. Cassirer (1979a, pp. 69, 70). 43 Konersmann (2003, p. 149) fittedly quotes from Kant's letter of July 1, 1794 to Jakob Sigismund Beck: "We can only understand and tell others what we ourselves can do." A link between Kant and Vico, the latter of whom Cassirer in fact likes to cite, remains unsubstantiated, and Cassirer does not claim there is one. 44 Cassirer (1996, p. 162). Cf. Dilthey, Cassirer (1996, pp. 160, 164). 45 Kant (2003, В 303); cf. Cassirer (1979a, p. 70); Cassirer (1956c, 227ff) cited here. 46 Cf. Cassirer (1956c, p. 228). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">124 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 discussion of culture as found in Windelband and Rickert sets off at too high a level: "Whoever begins the critique of knowledge with the theory of science [ ...] applies, so to speak, the lever at too high a point," Cassirer writes in The Logic of the Cultural Sciences. He correspondingly resolves "to carry the discussion beyond the domain of mere logic and the theory of science," that is, "to go back from the [scientific- theoretically elaborated] structure of concepts to the [culturally lived] structure of perception."47 The special achievement of Cassirer is that he succeeds in giving an intrinsic definition to culture while working within neo-Kantianism, whereas both Cohen at Marburg and Windelband and Rickert in the German Southwest tend to read the concept of culture into Kant from the outside, regarding his three critiques to be scientific- theoretical accounts of three cultural realms, which they hope to abstractly unify in the 'unity of the cultural consciousness.' Cassirer held that the topic of culture can be approached from two directions. The first is the just mentioned notion (regarding culture) of constitutive modalization, which is alive in the basic conception of critical-transcendental idealism. The other is Cassirer's own, as it were, cultivated encounter with art that he worked out not only philosophically, but to which he had an original aesthetic access, especially in the case of literary art. Along these lines, in 1942 Cassirer says of art: Each 4s' and 'exists'; it discloses to us a knowledge that cannot be grasped in abstract concepts yet nevertheless stands before us as the revelation of some- thing new, something never before known or familiar. It belongs to the greatest achievements of art that it is able to permit us to feel and recognize the objective even in the individual, while on the other hand placing all its objective forma- tions concretely and individually before us and in this way filling them with the strongest and most intense life.48 Obviously, the artwork can function - wholly on its own sovereignty, so to speak - as a paradigm of the critical-idealistic conception of constitutive modalization. Indeed, the first hints at this view reach back to Cassirer's early years. They can be found at work in his interpretation of Cohen's aesthetics in his 1912 essay in Kant-Studien , "Hermann Cohen und die Erneuerung der Kantischen Philosophie": Art therefore is not isolated among the modes of consciousness anymore, rather it is art that presents the 'principle' behind these modes and their interrelation in a new sense. The transcendental system in its generality does not really repre- sent a closed network of knowledge, but rather a network of ways of producing consciousness, each one of which brings forth a peculiar content. Cassirer next cites Cohen's formula (from his book Kants Begründung der Ästhetik) of "consciousness as principle of all cultural realms."49 For Cassirer, this consciousness 47 Cassirer (2000, pp. 14, 56).

In his late work of 1942, the collection of essays titled The Logic of the Cul- tural Sciences , Cassirer attempts to develop, against the backdrop of a conception of philosophy of culture (i.e. of 'critical idealism' and the 'philosophy of symbolic forms'), a closer determination of approaches to the science of culture. The cultural and the natural sciences must be confronted for didactic reasons. However, this con- frontation is one that natural consciousness seems always already to be carrying out in an elementary fashion. Accordingly, the "cosmos of nature" and the "cosmos of culture" stand opposite one another,51 even though - philosophically viewed - natural science and cultural science, both human world-understandings, are prime examples of symbolic forms, and hence co-constitute the universum symbolicum. And this 'uni- verse,' which includes a view of nature, seems more aptly named 'cosmos of culture' than 'cosmos of nature.' Indeed, one can ask oneself whether the phrase 'cosmos of nature' is at all sustainable as an independent concept, as 'cosmos' originates as a cultural concept, as Cassirer himself has shown.52 The five studies in The Logic of the Cultural Sciences do not form a closed work in which these problems are clarified in a strictly systematic manner. Still, the remarks, freely referencing various cultural and scientific developments, certainly have an inner structure: moving from the genesis of the topic of 'culture' and the mode in which it is given (I. "The Object of the Science of Culture"), we are led to the original condition for the constitution of culture, which Cassirer locates in the perception of expression (II. 'The Perception of Things and the Perception of Expression"). Addressed here is the fundamental distinction between a 'thingly' [dinglichen] and a 'personal' [person- alen] conception of reality. The more precise distinction between natural science and cultural science and their respective conceptual typologies follows (III. "Concepts of Nature and Concepts of Culture"). Cassirer emphasizes the unavoidability of anthro- pomorphism in the cultural sciences as much as the relevance of form or concepts of sense and of style to the cultural scientific orientation. From here he frames the relation of the cultural sciences to the natural sciences in terms of a "logic of research,"53 in order to prove that the analysis of form and the analysis of cause are two different yet complementary directions of scientific procedure (IV. "The Problem of Form and the Problem of Cause"). This entails articulating an individuated concept of herme- neutics alongside the formal analysis. The fifth study leads to closure, chiefly through the discussion of a kind of pathology of culture, which is indicated in terms such as 'alienation' and 'tragedy,' but also through a re-examination of the relationship of culture to nature.54 In what follows, some solutions and problems presented in the five studies will be looked at more closely. 50 But myth, too, can in this sense be paradigmatic, for "concept formation" "in the mythical and religious sphere" shows "the ideal meaning and the ideal conditionality of concept formation in general"; so Cassirer (1956b, p. 59). 51 Cassirer (2000, p. 20). 52 Cf. Cassirer (1941); also see Cassirer (1972, p. 221). 53 Cassirer (2000, p. 96). 54 Cassirer (2000, pp. 123, 125ff). On the topic of the pathology of symbolic forms, cf. Orth (2004b). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="12">126 Synthese (201 1) 179:1 15-134 In the first study, "The Object of the Science of Culture," Cassirer shows how the topic of culture presents itself in human history - one is tempted to say 'in culture' - as an orienting story. Man discovers orders in reality that are essentially his own creations. It is the "order of nature" that faces the human being (also encircling him objectively), and the order "in his own world."55 Yet "everything that man creates, and that comes forth from his own hands," is initially a "mystery" to him and is often interpreted as divinely caused. This speaks to the general finding that Cassirer later (in the third study) mentions, namely that in contrast to the "object of nature" (that which lies before our eyes), the "cultural object" "lies, so to speak, behind us."56 Moments of crisis and conflict must arise in the orienting story, in order that the problem of culture become conscious. In his first study Cassirer illustrates such moments with the example of Vico, as well as changes in the understanding of the concept of life in the nineteenth century and thereafter.57 In the second study, "The Perception of Things and the Perception of Expression," Cassirer exposes the basis for all conceptions of culture. It lies in vital perception as meaning-determining. Here Cassirer essentially rehearses the content of his theory of 'symbolic pregnance' [symbolische Prägnanz],58 though in different language and without himself remarking upon it. Perception has "in its simple phenomenal state [ . . .] to some extent, a double face."59 It divides into 'thing perception' [Dingwahrnehmung] and the 'perception of expression' [Ausdruckswahr- nehmung]. Both are in fact culturally generated. But in the case of thing perception, the constitutive modality of meaningful vitality - the nub of culture, so to speak - is as it were screened off in order to accentuate and fix objective thingliness. Cassirer speaks of the differentiation in the case of perception of an "I pole" from an "object pole." The object, the other (set against the perceiving person), can now plainly be an "it," a thing, "an aliud" but it can also be an "alter ego," a "you."60 To the extent that Cassirer emphasizes perception and its implied you, the cultural realm is high- lighted. In this sense, one can conceive of the natural scientific view of the object - a methodically grounded view - as a mode that is derived from a view of culture that is derivatory and possibly deficient. Cassirer in this context expressly references the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, who pointed out that "even in the physical conception of the world this elimination of the 'personal' can never be absolutely successful, but is to be viewed only as a limiting concept of the method of the natural sciences."61 55 Cassirer (2000, Iff). Notably, such contrasts normally only exhibit themselves on more developed lev- els of orientation, so that the historian of mind easily falls into a fallacy, in the sense of William James's "psychologists 's fallacy." Cassirer has considered this problem expressly under this name; cf. Cassirer (1972, p. 66), as well as Cassirer (1985, p. 145); cf. also Cassirer (1979b, p. 124), where there is mention of the "historian's fallacy." 56 Cassirer (2000, pp. 2, 86). 57 Cassirer (2000, pp. 10, 20ff). Cassirer fundamentally sees crises of orientation as constitutive of the self-reflexivity of the human being and therefore of philosophical anthropology. 58 Cf. Cassirer (1957, p. 235). 59 Cassirer (2000, p. 39). 60 Cassirer (2000, p. 39). 61 Cassirer (2000, pp. 46, 47). â Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 127 Insofar as cultural science is science, however, it strays into a peculiar double relation to myth. As "theoretical explanation of the world" it must face the "spiritual force of myth" in the name of a higher differentiation; then again it is precisely myth that embodies the perception of expression in its primacy.62 According to Cassir- er, the rationalizing correction of myth can lead to a sort of overcompensation in the form of naturalism and reductionism and thus to a denial of the basic cultural find- ing of expression. One must distinguish, though, between a narrower and a broader (global) concept of expression in Cassirer. In his Logic of the Cultural Sciences , Cassirer does not discuss the distinguishing of three symbolic functions - expression, representation, and pure meaning.63 Indeed, in the second study he occasionally seems to take 'expression' and 'representation' to be synonyms, as when he writes that "as different as they may be from one another, all cultural forms are active 'forms' of expression ," and then ascribes such "appearance of a 'meaning,'" in contrast to the merely physical, to the "representational function."64 One must obviously distinguish between expression in the global sense, which is the manifestation of meaning as such, and expression in the narrower sense (before further differentiation), as is symptom- atic of myth. Cassirer 's thesis in Language and Myth (published in German in 1925) concerning the history of mind and structure is relevant here: "Myth, language, and art begin as a concrete, undivided unity, which is only gradually resolved into a triad of independent modes of spiritual creativity."65 Similarly, in the second study, "the 'I' and the 'you' are not finished conditions rather is it the case that "the world of the 'I' and that of the 'you' first constitute themselves" in these "forms of culture."66 In the third study, "Concepts of Nature and Concepts of Culture," two items are relevant to our considerations: the concept of style [Stilbegriff] and the concept of media [Medienbegriff]. Cassirer adopts the concept of style from art theory, above all from Heinrich Wölfflin's "Kunsgeschichtlichen Grundbegriffen" of 191 5. 67 Cassirer does not mention Nietzsche's definition of "culture" as "unity of style in all the expres- sions of the life of a people."68 "Concepts of style" are, according to Cassirer, "concepts of form" or "concepts of structure" in Wilhelm von Humboldt's sense of an "inner form of language" or "lawful form." They are neither "nomothetic" nor "ideographic" in Windelband's sense and must strictly be distinguished from Rickert's "concepts 62 Cassirer (2000, p. 40). 63 Cf. Cassirer (1978), where Cassirer classifies the three forms 'expression,' 'representation,' and 'pure meaning' as "symbolic functions." In 'expression,' the sensuous and the meaningful remain unseparated; in 'representation' there is a consciousness of the virtual difference between the sensuous substratum and meaning, a consciousness that enables both objective orientation as well as artistic creation. 'Pure meaning' comes into play where formal calculations are functionally engaged. 64 Cassirer (2000, pp. 43, 5 1 ). 65 Cassirer ( 1 946, p. 98). Cf. Cassirer ( 1 979a, p. 87): "Myth is to be regarded as a common background and common basis for all the various energies that participate and cooperate in the construction of our human world." 66 Cassirer (2000, p. 50). 67 Cassirer (2000, p. 60). 08 On this phrase (from the "Untimely Meditations Part I") and its variations cf. Orth (2003b), particularly p. 148ff. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="14">128 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 of value."69 Cassirer is at the limit of what is terminologically possible within the frame of his own theory when he writes: "What the concepts of style represent is not an ought but a pure 'being' - even though this being is concerned not with physical things but with the existence of 'forms.'"70 It is worth mentioning that Cassirer already employed the concept of style in 1921/22 - though in another context, namely in his essay "Der Begriff der symbolischen Form im Aufbau der Geisteswissenschaften." He there distinguishes, in line with Goethe's famous essay, "simple imitation" [einfache Nachahmung], "manner" [Manier], and "style" [Stil], comparable to the later dis- tinction of expression, representation, and pure meaning.71 Though Cassirer devotes himself to the sciences of spirit in this essay, he regards the subtle, mathematical symbolism of Einstein's relativity theory to be a prime example of 'style.'72 It is the 'being of forms' that allows access to the problem of the media. According to Cassirer, "culture is constructed" out of "the medium of different worlds of form." "Culture" thereby proves itself to be an "intersubjective world" that "I and you" appro- priate "in active exchange," in order to take part in it. The form of "participation" in this world of media, insofar as it is a world of form, "is totally different from that in the physical world." It is "communication."73 In the media, a 'shared world' is constructed. Already in the considerations of the second study, the "knowledge of the 'physical' is the foundation and substratum for every such construction. There are no pure 'ideals' that could do without this support. The ideal exists only insofar as it represents itself sensuously and materially in some manner and embodies itself in this representation.74 The medium is hence not the mere substrate, but the latter's modalization, i.e. the way ("in some manner") and the sense in which embodied representation comes about. Culture as paragon of all mediality is the dimension of this representation. The actual symbolic forms are the media. In line with this, Cassirer states in his third study regarding the understanding of forms as medial occurrence: "We live in the words of language, the figurations of poetry and the plastic arts, the forms of music, the formations of religious ideas and beliefs. And it is only in them that we 'know' each other." Cassirer emphasizes: "This intuitive knowledge does not yet have the character of 'science.' We understand one another in speech without requiring the science of language or grammar; and the 'natural' artistic feeling does not require art history or stylistics. But this 'natural' understanding soon reaches its limits." These limits 69 Cassirer (2000, 58ff, 63). 70 Cassirer (2000, p. 63). 71 Cassirer (1956a, p. 182). See also Cassirer (2003), where Cassirer interprets Thomas Mann's novel as a brilliant composition according to the triad 'imitation, manner, style' by showing how 'imitation' and 'manner' are sublated in 'style.' 72 Cassirer (1956a, p. 187). 73 Cassirer (2000, p. 75). 74 Cassirer (2000, p. 42). When the 'ideal' is 'pure being' (Cassirer 2000, p. 63), it seems unable to exist as such and to be accounted for.

This is proven in the fact that every "cultural object" (as already noted in the third study) features three sides, due to its constitutive embodiment, as it were: "a physical, a psychological, and a historical side,"76 each of which implicates processes of becoming. Initially in the fourth study, Cassirer tries to make the "Aristo- telian concept of the formal cause " methodically visible under new, non-metaphysical conditions, and emerging out of newer natural scientific developments. To this end, he references field theory in physics in connection with Hermann Weyl and biologi- cal holism in L. von Bertallanfy's sense, for instance, but also - without naming any names - holistic and structural psychology.77 This "methodological transformation of physics, biology, and psychology" is worth mentioning "only - so Cassirer - in order to raise the question as to what extent a new aspect emerges from this for the formation of the sciences of culture." True, the "recognition of the concept of wholeness and of the concept of structure has by no means effaced or eliminated the difference between the sciences of nature and the sciences of culture"; but now "the science of culture can immerse itself in the study of its own forms [ . . .] with greater freedom and ease than before."78 Such a new direction of research leads Cassirer to distinguish three dimensions "of the consideration of cultural events." The " analysis of becoming [ ...] resides essen- tially in the study of cause and effect." It "contrasts with the analysis of work and the analysis of form"19 A remarkable sentence follows: "It is the analysis of work that constitutes the actual fundamental bedrock." It provides us an "overall view of the works of language, art, and religion," and so on, even before we have achieved insight into the historical and causal relations of cultural phenomena.80 This means: "We must have penetrated [the] meaning" of works; "we must understand what they have to say to us." This already occurs pre-scientifically of course. But in order to bring it to full "understanding," "its own method of interpretation" must be applied, "an independent and highly difficult and complex 'hermeneutics.'"81 Cassirer does not tell us here how 75 Cassirer (2000, 75ff). In asking about the possible conditions for their meaningful use, something like a critique of the media is being implied, though not to the extent that they are renounced. 76 Cassirer (2000, p. 57). 77 Cassirer &lt;2000. dd. 88. 92. 95ff&gt;. 78 Cassirer (2000, p. 96). Here Cassirer is at the edge of the system theory. Cf. on this also Cassirer ( 1 945), as well as Cassirer (1993c). 79 Cassirer (2000, p. 97). 80 Cassirer (2000, p. 97). We may add "and so on," because 'works' are conceivably produced in other domains of form. 81 Cassirer (2000, p. 97). We find the term 'hermeneutics' (or 'hermeneutical') to have a further meaning as the understanding of meaning in general, in Cassirer (1993a), e.g., p. 91. "Hermeneutical function" and the problems of knowledge and of truth are to be grasped "as special cases of the general problem of meaning" (Cassirer 1993a, p. 81). Cf. also Cassirer (1996, p. 166): "The theory of knowledge is basically nothing other than a hermeneutics of knowledge, but a hermeneutics that in each case takes up a peculiar 'direction' ^ Springer</page><page sequence="16">130 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 this hermeneutics is to function positively in the individual case. Of note is the fact that he takes this hermeneutics to be foundational as well as specialized. It is so to speak the elementary emergence of meaning, which in fact must have been achieved through actual paradigms (concrete and not abstract), through actual individual works. The conscious analysis of this is "hermeneutics." According to Cassirer, the analysis of form, which determines the nature of the cultural form within which actual works emerge, can and must align itself with this. Cassirer recognizes the cultural forms that possess such determined natures as 'symbolic forms'; in line with the analysis of form these natures must be investigated in terms of their respective "functions" on the one hand and their connection with each other on the other. Here - in a philosophy of symbolic forms - lies the quasi terminus of "a 'theory' of culture," according to Cassirer.82 Remarkably, Cassirer holds that there is still "a further step" to the analysis of form, namely the analysis of act .83 Here he investigates "the mental processes from which [the formations, the works, and the forms of culture] have emerged and of which they constitute the objective expression." "We are exploring the particular nature of that 'symbol' that manifests itself in the use of human language."84 Notably, the focus is obviously on an analysis of becoming, which nonetheless differs from the one mentioned above. This concerns a "pure becoming," a genesis, so to speak, "within the 'form.'"85 Cassirer refers - as he often does elsewhere - to the Platonic phrase of a "becoming toward being," i.e. yêvecnçe go aiav .86 In his early essay on "Die Kantischen Elemente in Wilhelm von Humboldts Sprachphilosophie" (from 1923), in which Humboldt's 'genetic definition' (as form-determination of language) is explained, Cassirer writes: "This genesis itself is however to be viewed not as psycho- logical, but as transcendental."87 Cassirer's analysis of act thus comes somewhat close to Husserl's noetic analysis. Recalling Cassirer's concept of hermeneutics developed above, the question arises - in the light of that which has now been said - whether the understanding mentioned there is intelligible at all without the form- and act-analyses; in other words, whether an additional concept of hermeneutics is not indeed called for. Footnote 81 continued of knowledge" according to "different forms of exegesis ." On p. 206: "All intellectual history is based on hermeneutics." 82 Cassirer (2000, p. 97). 83 Cassirer (2000, 97ff). This is likely not an aspect of the analysis of form as "twofold task." The twofold task of the analysis of form seems to concern first the "'what' of each individual form of culture" and second, "how" the forms "are related" to one another. 84 Cassirer (2000, p. 98). 85 Cassirer (2000, p. 100). 86 Cassirer (2000, p. 100). Cf. also Cassirer (1953a, p. 11). 87 Cf. p. 259. In Cassirer (1920, p. 116), Cassirer speaks similarly about an "anthropomorphism" that is "not to be understood in a narrow psychological, but in a general, critical-transcendental sense." An anthropology without a fixed, essentialized picture of humanity permits an emphasis on functional energies of creation. In Cassirer (1956a, p. 183), the concern is not so much with "the nature of the picture," as with the "simultaneously free and law-bound nature of creation." Cassirer refers to the law against idolatry as the borderline of the mythical and the prophetic consciousness (Cassirer 1956a, p. 189) - hence as a meaningful phenomenon in religious and intellectual history. Springer</page><page sequence="17">Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 131 However one views the analyses of becoming and of work (as hermeneutics), as well as the analyses of form and of act, for Cassirer the "question of the formation of the symbol-function is not solvable with scientific means." The "transition from culture to nature," which is indeed a fact, represents that kind of development "that we can surely show, but cannot explain in causal terms."88 The concluding fifth study from The Logic of the Cultural Sciences concerning "The Tragedy of Culture"' links up with this cultural finding. It inquires into the possibility of a pathology of culture,89 recalling Simmel's essay "Der Begriff und die Tragödie der Kultur" from 1911. 90 Simmel's thesis is that cultural objects, created by human beings from out of energies of the soul, confront their creator as alienated objects. Cassirer takes this thesis to be one-sided, though he cannot deny that the process and the structure of such objectifications take place in culture; indeed, they belong to its generative principle. But Cassirer observes that cultural objects as works concern not the 'it' but the 'you' (hence personal vitality), insofar as the "work" is "only a point of passage," a "bridge that leads from one I-pole to another."91 For this reason, Cassirer replaces the model of culture as 'tragedy' with that of culture as 'drama.'92 But in regards to this drama, Cassirer must admit to something like the vulnerability of "cul- tural goods": "For even these goods have a material side that renders them vulnerable." And "in its speech, its art, and all its cultural forms, mankind has created, so to speak, a new body for itself which belongs jointly to all."93 That is: material damage is not harmless; according to the Cassirerian conception of culture, it breaks the sense of cul- ture [Kultur sinn]. In his 1939 essay, "Naturalistische und humanistische Begründung der Kulturphilosophie," Cassirer denied the certain predictability of the "future form of culture," indeed for culture tout court , because particularly the "doing" that con- stitutes culture "learns" and "becomes aware" of itself "only in its own fulfillment." A critical philosophy of culture cannot evade "the constantly resurfacing insecurity 88 Cf. Cassirer (1996, pp. 40-47, 60-64). In the posthumously published works from 1928, Cassirer devel- ops a "philosophy of nature" in the context of his treatment of spirit and life. He 'contrastively' compares the concept of symbolic form with Uexkiill's blue print of the animal, divided into the phenomenal and the 'effecting' world [Merk- und Wirkwelt], not in order to derive one from the other, rather to have each shed light on the other. Cassirer correspondingly emphasizes at the close of the fifth study of Cassirer (2000) that "in cultural phenomena, however, this biological barrier has been removed. In the 'symbolic forms,' which are characteristic of his essence and his ability, man has, as it were, found the solution to a task that organic nature as such was incapable of solving. 'Spirit' has achieved what was denied to 'life.' Here the becoming and the effect of individuals are linked to the whole in a totally different and more profound way. What individuals feel, will, and think does not remain enclosed within themselves; it is objectified in their work. And these works of language, poetry, plastic art, and religion, become the 'monuments,' the signs of remembrance and recollection of humanity" (Cassirer 2000, p. 126). Thus culture fulfills two functions. First, it places the human being as individual ontologically above the species and secondly, it objectifies the human world in the works of culture, which reach beyond and support the individual, but which the individual nonetheless internally participates in. 89 Cf. Cassirer (1957, pp. 238-325). On this see Orth (2004a). 90 Cf. Simmel(1983). 91 Cassirer (2000, p. 110). 92 Cassirer (2000, p. 123). 9^ Cassirer (2000, p. 127). ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">132 Synthese (2011) 179:115-134 concerning the fate and the future of human culture. It must recognize the limits of historical determinism, the limits of calculatability. All that can be said here is that culture will be and will advance, insofar [!] as the form-building powers, which in the end emerge from ourselves, do not fail or weaken.94 In the 1942 study, the path of culture is described as dialectical. "Culture is 'dialecti- cal' insofar as it is dramatic. It is no simple event, no peaceful sequence of events, but an activity that must always begin anew, and that is never sure of its goal." It shifts necessarily between "conservation" and "renewal." The "equilibrium" that is sought between the two is "never more than an unstable balance." Incidentally, "with the growth and development of culture, [ . . .] the amplitude of the oscillation" increases.95 In his 1930 essay "Form und Technik," Cassirer methodically deploys his triad of symbolic functions (expression, representation, and pure meaning), stating that "all cultural development" takes place between the two extremes of "expression" and "pure meaning" and that "in art the ideal balance between these two extremes [is] to a cer- tain extent achieved."96 In the end, this suggests that art or at least artistically inspired language - qua literature - is the suitable form by which to grasp the object studied by the cultural sciences. Cassirer sought to adopt this language both as a philosopher and as a cultural scientist. References Cassirer, E. (1912). Hermann Cohen und die Erneuerung der Kantischen Philosophie.
