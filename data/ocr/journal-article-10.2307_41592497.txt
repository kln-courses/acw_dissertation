<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews D.C. Feeney. The Gods in Epic : Poets and Critics of the Classical Tradition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993. Pp. viii + 449. $27.00 (pb.). First edition (hb.) 1991. The welcome reprint of this superb study in paperback presents an opportunity to urge all classicists interested in ancient epic, religion, or literary theory to buy, read, and begin to respond to it. As the brief Introduction explains, "The book begins, not with Homer, but with the reception of Homer, and with the evolution of diverse ways of understanding the gods in epic," and then attempts "to view the classical tradition as a whole." Chapters focus on "The Critics: Beginnings, and a Synthesis," "Apollonius* Argonautica ," "From Greece to Rome: Naevius and Ennius," "Vergil's Aeneid" "Oviďs Metamor- phoses" "Epic of History: Lucan's Bellum Civile and Silius' Punica" and "Epic of Myth: Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica and Statius' Thebaid" In this edition "a few corrections" have been made, but apparently the technology now allows them to be slipped into the text so that we have no way of knowing what they are. Feeney combines a mastery of these diverse texts, and much of the enormous critical literature, with a fine critical sense that is both reasonably well-informed by contemporary theory, and careful and thoughtful about the application of theory to data. This enjoyable and well-written book makes clear that anyone who tries to understand the significance of the gods in any epic, without keeping in mind the whole of the epic and critical tradition, does so at great peril, much like a late arrival to a long-running conversation. Denis Feeney has now provided an indispensable guide to that conversation; he also offers an excellent model for criticism of Latin poetry that refrains from either inventing obscurities where the text is clear, or making an arbitrary choice when the text is indeterminate. The Introduction lays out some of the recurring questions Feeney will treat, but perhaps this sizable book gives too little help, in the Introduction and at the start of each chapter, in the form of descriptions of what each chapter will treat.1 The Introduction takes aim at the "novelistic prejudice" which produces "readings which gloss over the gods as a more or less lame short-hand which the poets must perforce employ in order to achieve effects more satisfyingly achieved by novelistic naturalism." Feeney argues that "a special handicap for most moderns as readers of ancient epic is our insensible assumption of the nat- uralistic novel as the norm for literature- a norm which itself often remains 1 There is this sentence at the end of the Introduction: "Fiction, then receives its main discussion with Apollonius, belief with Vergil, allegory with Statius, anthropomorphism with Ovid, and so on." By why "and so on?" And why not mention in this list that belief in myth, ancient his- toriography, and historical epic are discussed in the chapter on Lucan and Silius? Vergilius 87</page><page sequence="2">Reviews unexamined, since classicists tend to assume that naturalism is 'natural'." By studying the entire tradition, Feeney hopes to "recapture something of the inter- pretative conventions of the original reading community," in part by looking at "the ancient critics' attitudes to the levels of naturalism and verisimilitude to be expected in epic," and their "well-developed theories of epic fantasy and gen- eric classification." Chapter 1, "The Critics: Beginnings, and a Synthesis" is admittedly "selective to the point of curtness," but it provides a valuable and useful survey, with all Greek and Latin translated, as throughout the book, so that the book can be recommended to colleagues in other fields, and to undergraduates at all levels. Among those whose views of the gods of epic, or of the truth-value of poetry, are discussed are Presocratic thinkers and poets, Sophists, critics from several centuries, Aristotle, and then at some length the Homeric scholia.2 The Preface hints that the project began with study of the scholia, and the book demonstrates that "an acquaintance with the scholia is the best available way of reconstructing the apparatus which informed Vergil's or Oviďs reading of epic." Feeney will cite both the Greek and Latin tradition of commentary, with a num- ber of good observations about continuity, but the book is to a large extent a call for Latinists to pay as much attention to the Greek material as the poets seem to have. In sum, we see four ways of responding to the Homeric gods: to criticize, as Xenophanes and many scholia do; to allegorize or see the gods as standing for natural or other forces; to rationalize or Euhemerize; and finally, the method with which Feeney is most in sympathy, to allow for poetic fiction, for a poet to say things about the gods because of tradition, or to produce a desired effect in a particular passage. The chapter also calls attention to a sig- nificant misconception in modern views of literary gods, noting that the ancient critics' "assumption that the gods contribute to the plausibility of the epic action is a useful check on the very common modern assumption that the gods generally undermine the plausibility of the human action." Archaeologists and students of religion should welcome Feeney's stress on the importance of genre, 2 A more detailed (but not exhaustive) list, which may help classicists decide whether to take Feeney's suggestion that they skip the first half of the chapter: Xenophanes of Colophon; Theagenes of Rhegium (perhaps tne inventor of what would later Ъе called etymological allegory); Hecataeus of Miletus (as a rationalizer of myth); Stesichorus and Pindar (on false stories about Helen and Pelops); Prodicus and Protagoras; the Derveni Orphic papyrus (not mentioned, I believe, in the 1989 Cambridge History of Literary Criticism's volume I, Classical Criticism, but well described in a page by Feeney); the Dissoi Logoi (whose view that poets "compose their poems not with a view to truth but with a view to people's pleasure" is easy to overlook); Aristotle (in whom Feeney sees glimpses of a theory of fiction); later rationalizers such as Palaephatus and Euhemerus; the allegorical interpretation that must be distinguished, Feeney notes with reference to important new work by Long, from more sophisticated Stoic approaches; and the Apollodorus who wrote "On the Gods." 88 Vergilius</page><page sequence="3">Reviews and his claim that the gods existed for the ancients according to the rules of the particular context in which they were encountered, whether that be epic, lyric, cult, or philosophy; he compares the well-known ancient concept of the tripartite theology of the poets, the state, and the philosophers. Chapter 2, on "Apollonius 9 Argonautica," shows that the start of that poem is marked by the poet's "refusal to lay out the divine motivation of his epic," as Apollonius plays with the reader's expectation to be told about the plan or will of Zeus. Feeney argues that the Argonautica repeatedly confronts issues prominent in discussions of the Homeric gods for centuries; here, as in each chapter, the importance of studying the tradition rather than individual poets is clear. Feeney provides excellent discussions of "the human characters' knowledge or ignorance of the divine characters' actions;" of "the recurrent preoccupation with the problems of representing divinity;" of how Zeus is "a character left carefully unexpunged of the flaws exposed by three hundred years of criticism;" and of how Apollonius sometimes briefly suggests, but then makes impossible, a rationalized "reading out" of the gods. In treating the depiction of Eros at the start of Book 3, Feeney asks that we try to "understand the effect of his presence instead of wishing he had never been introduced." The portrait of divine and human interaction in the Argonautica is shown to be shot through with ambiguity: the poem's narrator is often uncertain about whether and which gods have acted, and is thus more like Odysseus as narrator of Odyssey 9-12 than the more knowledgeable narrator of the rest of Homer. This "clammy atmos- phere of uncertain confusion ... is a major vehicle for many of the poem's cen- tral preoccupations, in particular its complex pessimism;" the presence or absence of confusion about the actions of the gods is a topic that will be handled with great skill for each poem discussed in the book. Chapter 3, "From Greece to Rome: Naevius and Ennius," covers most of the Roman background material, with a bit kept over for Chapter 6's discussion of historical epic. The chapter slights Catullus and the neoterics, Lucretius, and Lucilius; this deserves some comment. Catullus is mentioned in neither index, but those interested in the questions Feeney addresses should consider Catullus 64, which tells of the time when mortals and gods visited one another, or even the whole sequence 63-66, poems which "explore the domain of the relations between gods and men."3 The other neoterics may also have influenced the depiction of Augustan and later literary gods: Calvus' Io may have discussed the origin of the worship of Isis,4 and must have told of the love of Jupiter for Io, and the anger of Juno; Hera/ Juno's anger is a "major" theme in Feeneyb book. 109 25 119* ^ Most, "On the Arrangement of Catullus' Carmina Malora Philologus 125 (1981) 4 T.P. Wiseman, Cinna the Poet and Other Essays (Leicester 1974) 56. Vergilius 89</page><page sequence="4">Reviews Cinna's Smyrna was about the mother of Adonis, whom Venus will love, and who himself will receive cult. Valerius Cato's Dictyruia presumably dealt with the origin of that cult-name of Diana. Parthenius too may have played a role: among titles attributed to him are Aphrodite, Delos, and Hercules. Feeney does discuss the Argonautica of Varro Atacinus, but when he says that "all but one" of the "Roman epic poems" written in the "150 years between Ennius' Annales and Vergil's Aeneid . . . were historical poems," he might have mentioned that the road to heroic epic is prepared by Catullus' Peleus and Thetis and perhaps the other epyllia, and that some steps are taken by Georgics 4; in this book the term "neoteric masterpiece" is used only of Arachne's work in Ovid. Feeney also does not discuss Lucretius. A generation before Vergil wrote tantaene animis caelestibus irae? ( Aen. 1.11), Lucretius wrote that the nature of the gods пес bene promeritis capitar пес tangitur ira (1.49). It is easy to overstate the impact of Lucretius on the late republican and early Augustan literary scene, but like many of the texts dealt with by Feeney, Lucretius' poem opens by problematizing the nature of the gods: he begins with a prayer to the mytholo- gical Aeneadum genetrix, and then announces that the gods do not concern themselves with humans. Soon after comes a warning about the deceptiveness of vates (both the prophets of religion and the poets), and a discussion of Ennius that both criticizes him for his false depiction of the underworld and insinuates Lucretius into the place in the epic tradition that Feeney's omission denies him (102-35). Later passages of Lucretius specifically discuss personification, lies of poets, and the origin of belief in the gods of myth. Book 1 even offers the phrase fìngere possunt somma (sc. vates) (1.104-105), which might well be mentioned in a discussion of poetic fiction, and I have argued that this passage of Lucretius owes something to Lucilius frag. 484-89M, which derides belief in the bogeys propagated by people like Numa Pompilius.5 In 480-83M, perhaps from the same poem, Lucilius criticizes belief in the fictions of Homer, in these two frag- ments from Book 15, then, Lucilius is criticizing belief in the ficta of both poetry and religion. These complaints must be tempered in several ways. First, remarks about omissions must acknowledge that choices had to be made lest a book of this nature stretch on forever; my comments should be taken less as criticism of Feeney than as suggestions for those who would follow in his footsteps. Second, I am not challenging Feeney's implicit argument that the Greek tradition is as important as the Roman for almost every Roman poet. Third, it may be that generic considerations permit omission of the neoterics and the didactic Lucretius. But the third point may be challenged: aside from noting that the ancients had no term which does not mean "epic" for what we call neoteric 5 "Somnia ficta in Lucretius and Lucilius," CQ 37 (1987) 517-19. 90 Vergilius</page><page sequence="5">Reviews epyllia, and that recent work by Hardie and Farrell has shown that Vergil saw or created links between philosophical and heroic epic, we may observe that the book formally omits separate discussion of the gods in tragedy, but mentions tragedy's gods in a number of discussions: the neoterics and Lucretius deserve similar mention, but are simply left out. All that said, the chapter on Naevius and Ennius is quite useful, and meets its three goals: "to give a sketch of how the Romans took over Greek lit- erature, together with the apparatus of scholarship . . . , to mark out those key differences between Greek and Roman religion which will be most important for an understanding of how Roman epic treated the divine, . . . [and] to investi- gate the role of the divine in the epics of Naevius and Ennius. . . Feeney stresses both "the interdependence of poetry and scholarship at Rome" right from the start, and the original independence of Roman religion from litera- ture: "In Rome ... the productions of poets- Greek or native- were marginal not only for the actual practice and belief but also for intellectual inquiry into religion." Eventually, though, the boldness of Romans like Naevius and Ennius in "superimposing their national deity on Zeus," will dovetail with Roman con- quest and rule of the Mediterranean, and Feeney gives Naevius proper credit for the often overlooked way in which his Jupiter prophesies to Venus about the future glories of the Romans, so that "the mighty climax of the war against Carthage was the long-planned design of the gods acknowledged by the Roman state." Ennius may also have featured a prophecy by Jupiter, perhaps in the scenes in which Juno concedes to Roman rule (which Feeney discussed in an important article almost a decade ago). The chapter also usefully cites the learned etymologies for gods' names employed by Ennius and (to some extent) Naevius. Prophecy by Jupiter, at least partial concession by Juno, and etymologi- cal allegory will also feature in the pages that may be of most interest to readers of this journal, Chapter 4, on "Vergil's Aeneid." Feeney notes that "Virgil begins with the gods dominating the frontispiece of the poem," that he highlights the problem of divine anger, and that he indicates with the word fertur in 1.15 that Ennius will be "a cardinal model for the poem." We learn how the start of the poem introduces Juno as Carthaginian Tanit; as the Homeric Hera, grieved against Troy for the honors paid to Ganymede; "as aer ; the lower air, the sphere for storms of wind and cloud," and so as a threat to the order Jupiter tries to keep established; as "luno Iugalis, goddess of the marriage yoke;" and so in general as "a multivalent threatening negativity." In general, "the first 300 lines introduce half a dozen divine characters, and as many ways of regarding the gods, through different conventions of reading and understanding." Feeney sees little to encourage interpretations that disparage the poem's gods, and then attempt to penetrate an alleged "disguise" to the "reality" beneath. In the Intro- Vergilius 91</page><page sequence="6">Reviews duction Feeney observed that "criticizing the gods in epic as a literary device is like criticizing the carburetors or pistons in a car as an engineering device;" in this chapter he refutes Gordon Williams' detailed argument in favor of seeing the gods as "tropes" having little to do with the real world in which Aeneas, Turnus, and we live: "The gods of the Aeneid may be 'figures', 'tropes', 'symbols', but only as Aeneas is a figure or a trope." The argument is convinc- ing, but perhaps too dismissive of Williams, for when I read the Aeneid I feel that in an important sense Aeneas and Dido and Turnus are like me, and Venus is not, and some, though not all, of the details in the text point in Williams' direction. Its tough insistence that we deal with all the conflicting types of detail makes Feeney's discussion of the Allecto scenes in Aeneid 7 a superb lesson in mature and careful criticism of Latin poetry. A reviewer of Johnson's Darkness Visible noted with regret that it did not treat the Allecto scene; the omission need no longer be lamented, for Feeney, while complaining that Johnson's "example has still to make its deserved impact on our readings of such scenes," writes with Johnson's sense for nuance, and perhaps with greater clarity and persuasive power. When Allecto throws the snake at Amata, "Vergil's technique . . . makes it difficult to gloss, to skip, to be confident that we understand what is being described-what is 'happening'." The simile of the top can indicate external force- or the stirring of internal qualities ("Many readers will want to opt for one interpretation or the other, but the indeterminacy seems entirely in harmony with the technique we have been observing throughout the passage."). The simple phrase simulato numine Bacchi (7.385) does not tell us "who is pretending, Amata or Allecto?" In general terms, "reading the Allecto-Amata episode is like looking at an object through a pair of binoculars with incompatible lenses. If you close each eye in turn you can get the picture into focus, but it is impossible to harmonize the image with both open at once." Feeney does not trouble to point out that so many pages have been written, per- haps even careers built, on looking at Vergil with one eye closed; I almost wish we could begin using the term "one-eyed" for the kind of scholarship that Feeney is trying to correct. The chapter offers a similarly sophisticated discus- sion of Allecto's visit to Turnus; the whole chapter should (but, alas, probably will not) serve as a barrier to the return of simplistic views of Allecto as an unmistakable allegory for the evil already within Turnus, views which are pre- requisites for seeing Turnus as a comic-book villain whose indisputable guilt allows us to cheer his death at the hands of our faultless hero in Book 12. Feeney's later discussion of Heracles in the Aeneid reproaches "recent attempts to redeem Aeneas' violence from any suspicion of anxiety," which "miss the point of the identification with Hercules." 92 Vergilius</page><page sequence="7">Reviews Building on his discussions of earlier poets, Feeney makes numerous fine observations about Vergil's Jupiter; the centuries of criticism of Homer's gods, for example, add point to Vergil's references to the rapes of Ganymede and of Iarbas' mother. In Jupiter's prophecy in Book 1, "Virgil recasts Naevius' con- versation between Venus and Jupiter," but "the intervening years have delivered a stupendous bonus into the hands of the later poet, for the ruler of Vergil's world was a Julius." Vergil's debt to Naevius raises a question Feeney does not press: is Vergil simply repeating Naevius' argument about the Romans, with the additional references to Augustus, or is he doing something new? I was disappointed to see no reference to Feeney's arguments about uncertain aspects of the prophecies of Jupiter and especially Anchises in "History and Revelation in Vergil's Underworld," PCPS 32 (1986) 1-24; I have built upon some of those arguments in parts of my Death and the Optimistic Prophecy in Vergil's "Aeneid." Feeney also makes a number of fine observations about Juno's partial victory in Book 12, about Jupiter's use of the Dira, about Jupiter as "the emblem of the post-Saturnian age, . . . where man must endure toil, disease, and misery," and on the inadequacy of readings that equate Jupiter with a benign and impartial Providence: In this dismaying poem, most readers want to find a vantage point of comfort, and it is therefore tempting to construct a 'high' Stoic position in the portrayal of Jupiter, yet his participation in the narrative means that it is never easy, and it becomes finally impossible at the accommodation with Juno and the sending of the Dira. The narrator is ultimately unable to commit himself to Jupiter's perspective, as his helpless question in the last book shows: tanton placuit concurrere motu, luppiter ... ? Like the chapters on Apollonius and Vergil, Chapter 5, "Ovid's Metamorphoses ," begins with the start of the poem, but then unlike them jumps quickly to a later passage, the story of the weaving contest between Arachne and Minerva in Book 6. That discussion is excellent, although it is to be regretted that Feeney did not fully treat the introduction of the gods in Book 1, in the stories of creation, Lycaon, Daphnis, Io, Syrinx, and Phaethon, although of course one must be selective with Ovid, and the chapter will return to the Jupiter-Lycaon story a number of times. The discussion of Arachne and Minerva has affinities with that of Allecto in Vergil, in calling for a mature resistance to easy decision-making. After describing Minerva's work as weighty, Classical, and offering a decorous picture of just and orderly gods, and Arachne's as neoteric in style and presenting the gods as "bewilderingly mutat- ing in order to work their sexual will upon helpless humans," Feeney observes Vergilius 93</page><page sequence="8">Reviews that most modern readings side with either a Minervan or an Arachnean view of the gods in the whole poem. He finds this inadequate, and endorses instead the view of Leach that "if we adhere to one antithesis or die other we will fail to do what justice we can to the complexity of the poem's perspectives. Oviďs pendulum never rests in its oscillation between the poles of Minerva and Arachne, epic and neoteric canons: [as Leach argues,] 'As the creator of the poem, Ovid maintains a visions embracing both points of view'." Feeney acknowledges that in his view "Arachne's craft" might be, "in the end, closer to the poem's dominant mode;" we see this in his treatment of such issues as the poem's "continually destabilized generic norms" (where the influence of Hinds is clear); the stories in Books 9 and 10 of the aberrant sexual impulses of Biblis, Iphis and Myrrha (where divine behavior is sometimes cited as precedent); the anger of Jupiter (well placed in the context of the tradition); the undeserved punishment of Actaeon; Ovid as commentator on Vergil; his use of personifica- tion allegory; and the deification of Heracles, Aeneas, Romulus, Aesculapius, and finally Julius Caesar (I offer this incomplete list of some of the chapter's topics because the chapter is extremely unhelpful in indicating which of the many possible topics in the Metamorphoses it will tackle). Discussion of Caesar's deification leads to a discussion of Ovid and "Caesarism" that will be important both on its own and as a recurring theme in the discussion of later authors influenced by Ovid. Here again Feeney chal- lenges us to read well, and to respond to as many aspects of the text as possible. Unsympathetic to those who argue that Ovid's treatment of Julius Caesar and Augustus in Book 15 is just a "literary problem," and unsatisfied with the usual question about "whether or not Ovid is sincere, whether he is praising or sub- verting, being enthusiastic or ironic," Feeney tries to suggest a new approach, to which it is hard to do justice with brief summary. Basically he describes Ovid as exploring the nature of Augustus' power, and the changes that the Principáte was bringing to Rome's religion, often presenting "facts" to which the reader can respond in a number of ways. Thus when Ovid describes the Julians' "privatization of communal cult and . . . communalization of private cult," or says that it was not Caesar's deeds, but his son, that made him a god, or com- pares Augustus' power to that of Jupiter, the implications of the passages are richer than most subversiveness-hunts or "one-eyed" whitewashes allow.6 The chapter on Ovid ends with fine discussions of Ovid's "inventive engagement with . . . issues of fiction and authentication" (which looks back to 6 For more on Ovid and Augustus, and on the necessity of moving beyond past polariza- tions, see Feene/s, "Si licet et fas est: Ovid's Fasti and the Problem of Free Speech rader the Principáte," in Roman Poetry and Propaganda in the Age of Augustus, ed. Anton Powell (Bristol 1992) 1-25. 94 Vergilius</page><page sequence="9">Reviews earlier chapters), and of his use of "personification allegory" (which looks ahead to later epic). Chapter 6, "Epic of History: Lucan's Bellum Civile and Silius' Punica," begins with an extensive discussion of the ancient attitude to history and myth, calling especially on the recent work of Wiseman, Veyne, and Woodman; Feeney also surveys the lost or fragmentary historical epics which preceded Lucen. For Lucan's gods, again Feeney will contrast the views of modern critics who applaud Lucan for leaving out the gods, and those ancient critics for whom the absence of divine machinery means that Lucan is not a poet at all. As often, Feeney is precise in interrogating traditional views, noting that "this supposedly godless poem is obsessed with the gods, crammed with references to their plans and deeds," and that it is "specifically the mimesis of divine characters in action which is missing." After his survey of the use of the gods in earlier epic, Feeney is in the best possible position to evaluate the unique attitude towards the divine of Lucan, and he exploits this advantage well, arguing that the narrator's striking ignorance about the will of the gods plays an important thematic function in the Bellum Civile : The ignorant narrator, then, whose belligerently fallible voice has been so elaborately established, is necessarily a victim of the ignorance and uncertainty which plagues his characters when they try to penetrate the divine dimension to the meaning of events, to understand whether the catastrophe of the poem is the will of the gods or simply haphazard accident. Feeney argues that "this uncertainty persists through the poem, a confrontation between the Stoic dispensation and a non-teleological randomness which it does no harm to associate with the Epicureans." Rather than ignoring the gods, Lucan "has in fact engineered their absence into being the poem's principal device for obfuscation and aporia." This is perhaps the most radical and original interpretation in the book, although it dovetails with and in part grows out of recent work by Henderson and Masters. I also think that while the technique of Lucan thus exposed is unique, Feeney could have drawn connections between the uncertainties of Lucan and the ambiguities created by other means in Ovid and Virgil. Feeney does draw valuable connections between the attitudes of Lucan, Ovid, and to some degree Vergil to "Caesarism," making clear that at times Lucan is drawing upon the treatment of Julius and Augustus in Metamor- phoses 15. He also makes fine observations about the references or allusions to Gigantomachy ("a very odd sort of Gigantomachy, since the giant succeeds . . . [;] Caesar does storm Olympus and gain the company of the gods"), Phaethon, and Ovid's chaos, and about how Lucan follows Ovid's apparent insight that the gods of epic have come to be "the creatures of the princeps." Vergilius 95</page><page sequence="10">Reviews In discussing Silius Italicus' Punica in the Cambridge History of Classical Literature, D.W.T.C Vessey observed that "Life is brief, but Silius is not." Feeney's treatment of Silius is brief. Although he begins without the "usual modern assumption that divine action in historical epic is self-evidently ridiculous," Feeney concludes that "Silius' gods are a failure, and a strikingly comprehensive and depressing failure, but they fail on their and his own terms, victims of the large-scale enervation which dooms the work as a whole." His gods "come very close to being the tropes or figures which modern critics often take the gods of Vergil or Apollonius to be " Chapter 7 treats "Epic of Myth: Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica and Statius' Thebaid." One of the most impressive things about Feeney is that he writes with authority as he moves all the way from Xenophanes to Flavian epic, never seeming to be more at home with one author than another. Those without Feeney's range should not try to fake it, and should be briefer when discussing these poems. Feeney describes the confident vatic position of Valerius, who can thus know even the minds of the gods without trouble, and his skillful use of the Olympians. Statius he finds usually "ahead of' his critics, fully aware both of when he is being episodic, and of his own "belatedness," so that even his gods comment or whether or not they are playing their "usual" roles. Feeney des- cribes the "tussles" among divine, human, and underworld forces in the Thebaid, and (in part following O.S. Lewis' Allegory of Love) offers an interest- ing discussion of Statius' extensive use of personification allegory. There is no conclusion to the book, only a two-page "Epilogue," but some of Feeney's last few pages on Statius also display the virtues of this book quite well. Feeney has shown clearly that "there is a deep flaw in any theory of reading which holds that meaning is independent of its expression, which is what conventional theories of allegory inevitably end up implying, in their assumption that allegorical texts are saying something which may be extracted and reformu- lated in other terms without loss or damage." Two pages later he says that "what makes Statius' allegorical action so rewarding (and so difficult) to read is the continual reshuffling of positions demanded of the reader, who is tracing the tussle between the action of the human characters and the action of the allegorical figures who impinge upon them." What makes this book so reward- ing is the unflagging skill with which Feeney responds to the demands placed on the reader by ancient epic. I hope that his fine example has its deserved impact on our reading of these poems. James J. O'Hara Wesleyan University 96 Vergilius</page></plain_text>
