<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY BY GEORGES GUSDORF I. The Course of Metaphysics IVXy Treatise on Metaphysics (1956) ended with my turning away from traditional metaphysics. Even the form of the treatise had something challenging about it. There was no question of the eternal problems of the philosophia perennis; it was not con- cerned in any way with those reflections on Being and the Abso- lute, in which Being shuts out beings, or in which preoccupation with the Absolute places an impediment in the way of any under- standing of reality. The universe of metaphysics is not a separate universe; a replica (minus the colors and the fragrances) of this world; a looking-glass image; or, finally, the island of Atlantis, sunk for- ever beneath the waters. There is no world other than this; the fundamental task of metaphysics is to take stock of the world's meanings, and to attempt a critique of those meanings on a human scale. Philosophy thus recovers its secular function - the justification of existence. In the eyes of a critique that has been thoroughly awakened - that is able, in a certain sense, to pro- duce a metaphysics of metaphysics - the aim is not so very revolu- tionary. Thinkers of all times, when they have endeavored to take apart the links of being, have found in that attempt an expression consistent with their fundamental aspirations. Our own values assert themselves in other ways; yet, even though the language be different, they undoubtedly correspond to a common intent. That was how my thinking ran when, upon completing the Treatise on Metaphysics, I found myself, so to speak, "out of</page><page sequence="2">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 87 work." I had formed the plan for a metaphysics on a human scale, whose task would be to make out the human meanings of the world, the self, and God. I was unable to be satisfied with the initial investigations into these questions. But the danger was, if one stuck to the evidence supplied by immediate experience, of working out a kind of philosophy of common sense. The present state of our experimental knowledge obviously cannot carry the weight of authority that is carried by "time without end." The classical metaphysician seeks to establish the features of a transcendental truth; the ontological operation of the Cogito permits him to place the world as it is "between paren- theses," in such fashion that his doctrinal affirmations will have nothing at all to fear from the impact of changing circumstances, from their vicissitudes. In that way, he arrives at the wholly secure position of a rigorous theory, whose only inconvenience is that it applies to nothing and no one. My own studies had assumed a different direction, which was related, no doubt, to the direction indicated by Merleau-Ponty in his Phenomenology of Perception. Perception is the "native land" of truth, at once the point of departure and the point of arrival of all investigations of understanding. Merleau-Ponty opened up the perspective of a philosophy that, thanks to the application of the phenomenological method, suggests a vast inquiry into the consciousness of man as he perceives, feels and thinks, but without ever breaking contact with the world's pres- ence, without ever becoming resigned or disembodied in the manner of the classical metaphysician. The Foreword to the Phenomenology of Perception defines the task of philosophy as that of "clarifying our primordial know- ledge of the real, describing the perception of the world as that which forever underlies our conception of the truth." It now becomes a question of "seeking the essence of perception," which is henceforth regarded as "approach to the truth." (p. xi) That, it seemed to me, was the path to follow. The metaphysical enter- prise ought not to get lost in the chimeras of the beyond; on the</page><page sequence="3">88 SOCIAL RESEARCH contrary, it represents the sole direct approach to authentic reality. The direction appeared to me to be a sound one. But to the same extent to which my purpose linked itself with that of Merleau-Ponty, I could not help observing that, following the completion of his great work, the Phenomenology of Perception, the undertaking had been cut short. I have every reason to be- lieve that Merleau-Ponty's thesis, the publication of which was delayed until 1945, had been worked out, in its essentials, by 1940. There still remained to Merleau, before his premature death, a score of years of life. Yet, throughout that long period he did nothing, except occasional writings, some essays and arti- cles - in short, appendixes to his great work, but nothing that took up and truly carried forward his major undertaking. I have often thought about this silence of Merleau-Ponty's. Often I have posed the question for myself; and sometimes, dur- ing the course of our all too infrequent meetings, I have posed it to him. Then he would hide behind a smile and a pretense of modesty. He was at work; true, he had written, but he was not satisfied with what he had done; he was hesitant to publish. ... It is only now, with the perspective of time, that I think I can catch a glimpse of the true answer. If Merleau-Ponty never went beyond the Phenomenology of Perception, the reason is that it is impossible to go beyond it. It is always to be begun anew; it is never finished. If one regards the consciousness that comes into the world as a fundamental beginning, then it becomes a kind of primordial absolute, as inexhaustible and as incapable of being grasped as the Cogito of the intellectualizing metaphysi- cians. The phenomenology of perception emerges as the task of inten- sifying perception itself, and of carrying on a search for truth in the sense of a consciousness of consciousness, which would itself refer back to a more primitive consciousness. The pursuit of the Absolute in the concrete thus becomes as delusive as the hunt for Being, in accordance with the order of ideas, is in traditional metaphysics. That may be the secret reason for the</page><page sequence="4">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 89 relative silence that Merleau-Ponty maintained after the publi- cation of his theses. Whether or not he did so consciously, he had lost heart in the face of an undertaking that meant always returning to zero, always taking up the same initiative once again, with one sole certainty - that there would never be an end to it. Before Merleau-Ponty, his inspirer Husserl had known the same discouragement. As far as I was concerned, however, I had never given way to the fascination that Husserl exercised over a certain number of the minds of my generation. If the phenomenological method seemed meritorious to me, if in my view it provided the only human approach to human reality, there was also in Husserl's thought a sort of "metaphysics of the intuition of essences," set forth in a secret language that repelled me. I accepted the epistemology, and rejected the ontology. I was afraid that phe- nomenology might wind up being schematized into a body of formal knowledge, which would rapidly degenerate into a scholas- ticism at the service merely of some few initiates. I myself was concerned with the concrete, and I knew quite well that there is nothing more complex than that concept of "the concrete." In any event, this made me mistrust the phenomeno- logical claims to simplicity, or to "the evidence." I rejected the idea of a zero degree of consciousness, from which it would be possible to arrive at thought, thanks to some ideal procedure or other. We always think of ourselves as having direct access to the world; it seems to us to take shape before our very eyes, in all its definitive reality. But that belief will not stand up under investigation. Man, God, the world do not present themselves to us as motionless objects, unchanged in character throughout time. There have been eras in which the stability of structures - political, social, economic and intellectual - has permitted man to believe in the immutability of truth. But we moderns are living under the rule of the acceleration of history: the world changes unceasingly, in both its material and spiritual dimen- sions; man himself is being transformed, in terms of the piling</page><page sequence="5">90 SOCIAL RESEARCH up of his capacities and his store of understanding. At every moment there takes place a "throwing back into the pot" of meanings. The ceaseless transformations of the image of the world are linked with the transformation of the image of man, and mankind's relations with God also undergo the repercus- sions from these acts of renewal. Man does not have direct access to the substantive reality of his own being. Each human being who wishes to approach that reality on his own first has to go through the long detour of his personal history. The same thing holds true for a metaphysics that is regarded as the investigation of human consciousness. The objects on which it focuses are not transcendental realities, refined once for all time, but gatherings of representations, whose present status, always provisional and transitory, marks a certain specific moment in intellectual and spiritual conjunction. It was in this light that the path of a consistent metaphysics appeared to me to have to take in the long detour of the sciences of mankind. One must abandon all hope of ever retracing the opening and closing dialogue between absolute subject and ab- solute object. The traditional definition of truth as the cor- respondence between mind and matter assumes a third entity - an observer who is himself placed outside the confrontation in which he plays the decisive role, so that he might thus serve as referee. This role brings us back quite naturally to the God of the rationalists. As far as Husserl was concerned, he had never turned his back on the philosophy of God. But whoever searches out the path for a philosophy on a human scale has to be willing to think about the confrontation that lies at the heart of this other one. The truth he is looking for is a truth that projects beyond him, be- cause it encompasses him, and because it unceasingly places him in question in conformity with the renewals of his actual situa- tion. Those who hold to a truth that is monolithic and millenary at this point will voice loud objections. What will become of us,</page><page sequence="6">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 91 if truth is to be made consonant with time and with men, with the diversity of epochs and the multiplicity of thinkers? Charges of "psychologism" and "historicism" are already prepared: truth is no longer truth, if it is not unchangeable; anything else would be a contradiction in terms. To which I would reply that if a contradiction exists, it is only between terms that have been posed arbitrarily, and in the name of an ideal that is altogether artificial. It would be more convenient, of course, if we were able to set our own conditions for the truth. The only thing is that that would be to presuppose precisely what is in question. One can treat with disdain the question of the future of history and of culture, if one has in advance the last word on the matter. But so long as one does not have possession of that superhuman and non-human secret, the meaning of the truth becomes that of a journey toward the truth. It is the concern of the thinker to clear a path through the diversity of circumstances, by decipher- ing as well as he can the meanings of events. Philosophy for me has not been a matter of specialization, one particular area among other such areas, a province of knowledge. I had no desire to choose philosophy as against the rest, but rather along with the rest, and as a means with which to obtain the rest. Plato defined the philosopher as the man of the whole, by contrast with all those who see only one part or a single detail. I began to consider that the prime task of philosophy could well be to achieve a theory of cultural ensembles. One cannot philosophize in a void. The metaphysician is deluding himself if he thinks he can reach directly - by the shortest route - the timeless forms of the spirit. The dream of a root source or of a definitive structure is nothing but a mystifica- tion, whose repeated setbacks, throughout the history of philoso- phy, should have served as a lesson to those who persist in adding to their calculations all over again the nostalgia for the "philoso- pher's stone," a goal never attained by all the Argonauts of pure thought. Truth is not the faraway princess of some inaccessible Treasure Island, to which the most recent soldier of fortune has</page><page sequence="7">92 SOCIAL RESEARCH at last discovered that passageway so desperately searched for by so many others before him. Truth for man does not abide in the prestigious distances of eschatology; it is found within the reach of one's hand. As to the golden apples of the Garden of the Hesperides, it is in the neigh- borhood market, in the little carts of the tradesmen, that one must finally make up one's mind to look for them. The metaphysi- cian, instead of persisting in his chimeras, would do better to learn how to ply his trade like the rest of the world. This does not mean that this modest task would be easier for him than that internalized quest for the Grail to which ordinarily he prefers to devote himself. The everyday philosophy - which, like a job, must be gone back to, one day after another - unques- tionably calls for more real hard work than does the ' 'knowledge without taint" that is appropriate to the Sundays of thought. The impossibility of a philosophy without content is to be readily observed, moreover, in the history of thought. The subject of the philosophy of mind - which would be no more than the mind's consciousness of itself, or rather its self-digestion - is a belated product of Western speculative thought. The reflections one meets with in ancient philosophy took off from divine and human reality; from the pre-Socratics right up to Aristotle, ancient philosophy undertook to work out a cosmos of thought, capable of restoring reason to the real world. In the Middle Ages, Scholasticism found its source and its specific func- tion to be meditation and reflection on the Revelation. It set out to reconcile the different demands of the Word of God and of the human intellect. At the birth of the modern epoch, the mechanistic revolution, whose claims were asserted in the intellectual stage represented by Galileo, raised to a position of honor the newly established authority of the exact sciences, which became conscious of them- selves in the mathematical method, and embarked on their con- quest of the world with the nascent physical theories. The only thing is that this episode in the history of knowledge has been</page><page sequence="8">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 93 invested, in the Western consciousness, with such decisive signifi- cance that, during the course of the centuries since then that consciousness has been satisfied to mark time, and to dream of the application to the totality of the human domain of that method- ology that had already succeeded so well in one particular area of inquiry. It is Newton's genius that stands at the source of the positivisti misapprehensions. In completing Galileo's endeavors, at the end of the seventeenth century, Newton put the finishing touches to a systematic schema of the physical universe. After him, for more than a century, the theoreticians were to dream of estab- lishing, in all areas of knowledge - psychology, biology, medicine, sociology - an "order" analogous to the one that had been found to prevail in the heavens and on the earth. A hundred years after the publication of Newton's magnum opus, Kant main- tained that metaphysics should be able to function as a science, and that the distinguishing characteristic of science is the em- phasis it places on the mathematical method. He even went on to say - not without some degree of fool- hardiness - that chemistry and psychology, which were not re- ducible to calculation, could not on that account aspire to the full and separate dignity of being regarded as sciences. Lavoisier and Herbart undertook to undeceive Kant on this last point, yet at the same time justified his position. For if both chemistry and psychology have been accepted, during the course of the nineteenth century, among the sciences that are worthy of that name, this was after they had proven that they submitted to the specifications of the physico-mathematical methodology. The problem is that the triumph of positivism and of scientism during the course of the nineteenth century concealed, or at least turned its back on, a highly significant episode in the history of knowledge in the West. This was the appearance of a new form of learning which, beginning in the midst of the eighteenth century, went through a prodigious development in Europe. The new learning devoted itself to the human condition, re-</page><page sequence="9">94 SOCIAL RESEARCH garding it as a subject of objective inquiry, and dealing with it in terms of the demands of specific methodologies. The eighteenth century did not invent the sciences of mankind; they had already been heralded, sketched out in one place or another, throughout the diversity of cultural space-times. But it was in the eighteenth century that the historical and philological sci- ences, ethnography, political economy, psychology, truly became conscious of themselves. It was above all in Germany that intelligence, until then hardly awakened, at last took wing, thus fulfilling positivist research. The originator was Leibniz, but following his start the German universities were to become centers of a vast and unpre- judiced effort. Among them, the State University of Göttingen, founded in 1734, and profiting from a new and sturdy organiza- tion, was to be the most active arena of the historical, political, economic and philological disciplines, whose decisive signifi- cance among the numerous sectors of consciousness became characteristic of contemporary culture. One should take cognizance, in regard to the creation of the sciences of mankind, of the most significant aspect of European culture since the eighteenth century. It seems quite clear that this emergence touches us more closely than does the development of the mathematical or physical sciences. Nevertheless, it appears that the same interest has not been extended to the sciences of mankind as to the sciences of material reality. Everything goes on as if human intelligence, a latecomer in the history of knowledge, had not succeeded in freeing itself from the mechanistic schemata set forth ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century. The prestige of the exact sciences remains undiminished; they constitute the prototype for all truth; what is more, their significance is attested to every day by the development of the technical civilization on which the condi- tions of our existence depend. The promise of cybernetics, in its manifold forms, represents the last incarnation to date - and</page><page sequence="10">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 95 by no means the least dangerous among them - of this intellectual primacy of the machine. If one is content with this point of view, the sciences of man- kind, for all that they at least escape from the jurisdiction of electronic machines and perforated cards, thereby remain in- exact and approximating sciences, all the less scientific in reality. Renan, who was one of the few "defense witnesses" of the vast movement of the historical sciences in Germany, after having devoted his life - with glorious results - to philology and the history of religions, wound up doubting the value of those dis- ciplines. He treated them as "little conjectural sciences, which un- ceasingly fall apart after being completed, and will be forgotten in a hundred years." And Renan, keenly aware of the prestige in which his friend Berthelot was held, regretted that he had not chosen the upright and utilitarian path of chemistry, science of reality and benefactor of humanity. To put it another way, there is no assurance that the aspiring sciences of mankind deserve that title, or whether they may not be in reality literary disciplines, simply cultural domains, whose sole interest is to keep alive the dreams and the errors of generations long since gone. This was, without doubt, the origin of my reflections on the content of metaphysics. Why should metaphysics have to remain the prisoner of a moment in the history of thought that has since passed away? One cannot hold it against Descartes for having constructed a metaphysics out of mathematics and physics. His was a reflection of the new mechanistic world, as it emerged from the (intellectual) revolution of 1630. But there is no reason to want to perpetuate forever the epistemological truth, itself quite relative, of the year 1630. Metaphysics, insofar as it is an investi- gation into human consciousness, has to be begun over and over again, to the same extent as the renewals of self-consciousness that mankind undertakes. The fact is that, since the eighteenth century, man has become</page><page sequence="11">96 SOCIAL RESEARCH for man an object of objective knowledge. For nearly three centuries, and more and more clearly, man has been discovering that nothing is more alien to him than his own nature. Modern thought has undertaken the task of categorizing the diverse realms of nature; it cannot hide in the face of its responsibility for taking as its object of investigation the human realm, in both its unity and its diversity. Philosophy cannot therefore be separated from questions of general methodology, of epistemology. Only the testimony of the sciences is able to assure us that our reflections are not idle reveries, but come to grips with reality itself. But the actual reality with which we are confronted is not limited to the reality of mathematics and physics. The human condition consists of living in a human world, whose different aspects can be revealed to us by the sciences of mankind. Positivistic and scientistic prejudices, stubbornly clinging to a physico-chemical sort of truth as the sole prototype, arise out of the greatest absurdity. The truth for man cannot be reduced to the truth for things. Man, who constitutes the truth of things, is not subject to that material truth; he depends instead on a specific capacity for un- derstanding, whose main outlines it is the task of the modern sciences of man to recover. To put it another way, it is absolutely essential to expose the ancient misunderstanding that has been perpetuated in the very word "metaphysics." This term, in addition to being a child of chance, is ill-chosen: to begin with, on account of the "physics" part of it - as if all of human truth had necessarily to be located within the perspective of the understanding of nature (as defined by an exact science, linked with material reality), which thereby assumes in its own eyes an unwarranted primacy over human reality. Furthermore, the prefix "meta-" is also dangerous, inso- far as it gives rise to the belief that the truth of being comes after that of the world and of nature, thereby corresponding to another domain, independent of the first. But philosophical truth is not a truth "beyond," intrinsically</page><page sequence="12">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 97 different from truths about nature and man. It has no content of its own; its content is the totality of those evidences that are supplied through time and history by the stock-taking of the human condition, as this is achieved by the efforts of that group of learned men who have been at work in all sectors of the field of thought. It is obvious that one is here at the opposite pole from the cogitations, in a hermetic language, on Being and the Absolute that are the prime concern of the spiritual exercises proper to traditional metaphysics. For my part, I dreamed of a metaphysics whose task would be to carry through an understanding of understanding. By way of this re-understanding, the thinker exercises a right of recall over all the bits of learning that have been stored up by mankind from its beginnings. That huge collection of pieces of knowledge obscures the human visage, which it is now a matter of recovering. The fact that it is philosophy that now assumes control over the sciences of mankind is in keeping with the new consciousness of the responsibilities of thought. But it also has significant consequences to the extent that it brings with it a kind of recon- version of these sciences themselves. For up to the present the sciences of man have followed the line of greatest inclination in the history of thought. Not very numerous in the beginning, they have since scattered widely, in keeping with the enlarge- ment of epistemological space. They have obeyed the general imperative of specialization, which has unceasingly compartmentalized the intellectual dis- ciplines, by virtue of a division of labor that has been pressed further and further. But this crumbling of the disciplines has had as one result a dismemberment of the image of man. Many of what aspired to be the sciences of mankind have allowed them- selves to be caught in the trap of their own technical skill. Fas- cinated by their own procedures, they have become more and more "scientific," while at the same time becoming less and less human; they have lost en route the human intention that ani- mated them when they were setting forth.</page><page sequence="13">98 SOCIAL RESEARCH This epistemological misadventure is without question the major drama of contemporary culture. Philosophy here resumes a role suited to it: in the face of the specialists of specialty, it ought to try to be the specialist of mankind. It is fitting for it to climb once more up the slope of the downgrading of strength of intellect, and to reassemble what analysis has torn apart. The philosopher ought to take up the huge stockpile of findings ac- cumulated during the course of centuries by all the humanist disciplines, so as to unearth from it the visage of man. One can see, moreover, that it is not enough to rest content with the most recent state of affairs. The present situation of the sciences of mankind is only one provisional moment in a process of inquiry, which one cannot with reason hope to find some day fully completed. Man in search of himself changes himself dur- ing that very search. Every finding has developmental value. The sciences of man bring us a sort of photograph of an external and permanent reality; but in the movement of civiliza- tion they intervene as dynamic factors. The sciences of man are a construction of man. He who runs after his shadow will not catch it; yet he changes himself to the extent of the results he does attain and the road he has traversed in attaining them. Philosophy ought not to let itself be taken captive by what is most recent. There are fashions in the domain of the humanist sciences, just as there are elsewhere; and snobbism consists of believing that the latest discovery or the next inquiry will pro- vide definitive solutions. The path of philosophy will be the recapitulation of roads traversed. If the course of time has sepa- rated the sciences of mankind from one another, historical re- search will enable us to find once again the unity that has been lost, and even perhaps to point out the unity that has to be found once again. Nothing but a vision of totality - a vision centered in space and time - can hope to disentangle the meaning of the advance. That was how the task that needed to be taken up appeared to me - a task for philosophy, undoubtedly, but one that</page><page sequence="14">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 99 would have as its materials epistemology and history. The goal was to trace the development of the consciousness of man- kind, as it has been pursued by all those who have tried to de- cipher the mysteries of existence through the stages of develop- ment of culture. II. An Introduction to the Sciences of Man I had always been struck by the contempt in which the metho- dology of the social sciences was held in France. What was called "philosophy of science" in the curricula and in university courses was always reflection on mathematics and physics; sometimes it even went so far as to include biology in its considerations. But everything went on as if there could be no question of a philoso- phy of the social sciences. Nowhere was there a single professor- ship devoted to that area of study. Nevertheless, academic teaching raised - in passing - questions of method that did have to do with psychology, history, sociology. Yet all that was taught with regard to those disciplines added up to complaints about the lack of scientific rigor in the conclusions they arrived at. The quite imperfect condition of these more or less inconsistent bodies of learning was made the subject of study, the concealed intention being to demonstrate that the ideal situa- tion would be to obtain in these areas the same degree of exacti- tude that is found in what are called the exact sciences. Exacti- tude made itself known in the use of digits. For instance, in an example provided by an Anglo-Saxon historian, the ultimate aim of scientific history was to determine, with complete certainty, whether on the first day of July, 887, Charles the Great was in Ingelheim or in Lustnau. . . . The good historian would thus be comparable to a scientific expert employed by the police, or rather to a chemist; the trained psychologist would be like the conscientious and systematic physi- cian; the sociologist, handling social facts as if they were things, would restore the order - or rather the disorder - that prevails</page><page sequence="15">100 SOCIAL RESEARCH among men to its place at the heart of the changeless order of things. More recently, now that the new scientific spirit has somewhat refurbished its stock of images, it is in the direction of statistics, and above all of that altogether fascinating cybernetics, that our specialists have been casting their eyes. Sociologists, economists, psychologists look forward to getting computers for their birth- days, and the philologists dream of obtaining from some million- aire Santa Claus translation machines equipped with electronic brains of the latest model. The fact that these technical gadgets are put into service would not be such a serious matter, if these toys did not cover up, for those involved in using them, the very meaning of their investi- gations. They think that they are scientific men, because they employ devices that are - in their eyes, at least - indisputably scientific; the problem is that these devices take up all their attention, to the detriment of the goal being pursued. I recall reading the doctoral dissertation of Dr. George Dumas, patriarch and eponymous hero, not so long ago, of French psy- chology; the subject of the dissertation was Sadness and Joy. This eminent man of science had measured the blood pressure and the respiratory rhythm, and analyzed minutely the urine and the blood, of an appreciable number of individuals who were either happy or sad - at least, so he thought - before, during, and after their feeling the emotions in question. The most explicit part of this prodigious labor was summed up in tables of figures, in numberless columns, in which appeared urea ratios, and enumera- tions of the globules and proportions of carbonic acid. I owe it to the truth to report that he had not made a count of the vest and pants buttons, which might have provided at least one addi- tional column. As far as concerns human nature and the meaning of joy and sadness, I regret to say that this huge book did not teach me a thing. And I have always wondered whether Dr. Dumas de- tected sadness and joy in the composition of the urine, or assumed</page><page sequence="16">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 101 the existence of joy or of sadness (but in terms of what criterion?) before arranging his test-tubes in order. In any case, so much effort was not spent in vain: it made Dr. Dumas, for many decades, the unchallenged master of French psychology. About 1880 Fustel de Coulanges, revered master of historiogra- phy, outlined the calling of scientific history. "It is not an art," he wrote, "but a pure science. Like any other science, it con- sists of setting forth the facts, analyzing them, bringing them together, establishing the links between them. . . . The historian has no other ambition than to see the facts; ... he searches them out and tracks them down by the most detailed examina- tion of texts, just as the chemist discovers his facts in the most de- tailed carrying-through of experiments. His specific skill consists in digging out of the documents what is in them, and of adding nothing that is not in them. The best historian is the one who sticks closest to the texts, who interprets them with the maximum of justness, who does not write, does not even think, except in accordance with them." (The Frankish Monarchy, vol. I, p. 3.) If the author of The Political Institutions of Early France had dreams of rivaling the chemist Berthelot, who was a master of analysis and of triumphant syntheses, today's historian chooses to search for absolute precision in the ciphered spaces of economic history. We can determine - almost to within one fish - the traf- fic in salted herring between Lübeck and Famagouste in 1385, and one can well understand a multitude of "researchers" enthusiasti- cally devoting themselves to the establishment and verification of facts of this kind. The concentrated efforts of several genera- tions of men of learning will one day permit some historian in a future epoch to develop a brilliant synthesis, which will bring to light the metabolism of the herring among all the ports of the Christian West and for the entire duration of the Middle Ages. One must add that Fustel de Coulanges, who regarded him- self as a chemist, apparently knew nothing at all about chemistry. Still, he placed his trust in the fame of Berthelot, just as our kip- pered-herring fanatics dream of being the technocrats of a sort</page><page sequence="17">102 SOCIAL RESEARCH of five-year (or hundred-year) plan, applied in retrospect to the past, with the support of graphs and statistics. What is curious is the fact that the learned man in some particu- lar area or other is always tempted to look in some area other than his own for the certainties that he is endeavoring to bring to light in his own area of study. More exactly, he refuses to place in question, in advance, the certainty that he is seeking for. To inquire into his "business," his own "calling," would be metaphysics, and that he will have none of. From then on, he borrows, from a colleague who has arrived at results before he has, his model of understanding; but he does not take into ac- count the fact that, by that very move, he also borrows an under- lying epistemology and a metaphysics. This is the tragedy of positivism, in all fields: it would like to see regnant everywhere the same type of truth that has shown its mettle in mathematics and in physics. Yet it is still to be determined whether the truths of physics have a meaning out- side the reality of the physical world, whether the aspiration to mathematical exactness, applied where it does not belong, may not become the worst form of illusion. One day, when the medievalist Halphen was poring over the mysteries of some ancient cartulary, one of his pupils tried to enlighten him as to the meaning and implications of historical knowledge. Losing all patience, he wound up replying simply: "But what change is all that going to effect in the deed that I am engaged in studying?" And he plunged back into the fas- cinating question of whether Charles the Great was at Ingelheim, or at Lustnau, on the first day of July, 887. Halphen did not see what "all that" could change; but the trouble was that it was changing everything. The same labor in patient research as- sumes an altogether different significance when the light in which one examines it is modified, or the total field in which it is written down is altered. The social sciences have, as their object, man - a statement that seems difficult to challenge. Nevertheless, one consequence of</page><page sequence="18">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 103 this fact is that it is absurd to aspire to subject man to the methods of inquiry that have been successful in the case of chemical reac- tions or systems of physical forces. The methodology of physics or of mathematics is as much out of place in the realm of the human, as would be, in the physical or mathematical sciences, a metho- dology of the psychological type. It is true that real physics came into being at the time when Galileo swept off the field of experimentation those all-too-human meanings that had been lingering there ever since the origins of humanity. But from the fact that human meanings have been found to be out of place in physics, it is altogether stupid to main- tain that they have no place in psychology, history, or economics. To put it another way, the very anthropomorphism that is an epistemological roadblock in the sciences of nature, becomes the foundation-stone of epistemology in the realm of social studies. A smile is a human fact, involving both expression and com- munication. It is quite possible to make an anatomical and physiological study of the smile, describing sensory-motor circuits, networks of nerves, muscular systems set in motion by an external excitation that has stirred the subject to a response. One can attempt to measure a smile in terms of levels of electric intensity; one can make a record of arterial tension, analyze the urine. By so doing, one will bring to light the fact that the smile brings into play an extremely complex apparatus of equipment, so much so that the production of a smile would seem to be a distinctly un- likely phenomenon. After which, there will come along a computer expert, who will construct an electronic model of the smile, which will enable a highly efficient computer to turn out several million smiles per second. I am not saying that all this has no interest. In might even happen that it would add something to our knowledge of the smile. Still, a smile is a human fact, and as such it is part of a human reality. The smile of a young girl in love; the mother's smile to her infant; the smile of the Mona Lisa - these have their</page><page sequence="19">104 SOCIAL RESEARCH meaning and their merit at the level of human significance; they cannot be reduced either to physiology or to electronics. In order to grasp a fact of that nature, it must take its place in the ranks of the human, all of whose implications are, from the very beginning, presupposed. These reflections may seem to be self-evident. It nevertheless took me a good deal of time to find out for myself that man can be understood only in a human language, and that this dis- covery is the key to a new body of knowledge. One day, when I was leafing through the Ruins - that curious book by the ideolo- gist Volney - I was struck by a memorandum in which he sug- gested to the revolutionary authorities the setting up of a Museum of Man, and went on to say that an institution of that character was already in existence in St. Petersburg. Later I found in Hume the expression "science of man," and the suggestion of a "geography of the mind." These formulations struck me as sounding a new note for their times. The Man of traditional philosophy - a creature of God, and the enjoyer of ontological status - was not an object of sci- ence. Creator and developer of the science of things, by his very calling he was exempted from the jurisdiction of those methods of research that were useful for dealing with non- human reality. In order to arrive at the idea of a "science of man," it was necessary to overcome a kind of contradiction in terms, and to subject to re-examination the most venerable positions. I had hold of two links in a chain. Hume was of the tradition of Anglo-Saxon empiricism, which dates back to Bacon and Locke; this was the "experimental philosophy," which had been influenced by Newton, and had stimulated in France the move- ment of the Encyclopedists. Furthermore, Hume was the con- temporary of Linnaeus, who placed the human species in his gen- eral table of animal species, thereby opening the possibility of a natural history of man. As for Volney, he was part of the ex- traordinary team of the Ideologists, continuers of the Encyclo-</page><page sequence="20">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 105 pedia, which they endeavored to transform into action in the France of the Revolution. And Ideology, in the hands of Tracy, was defined as one branch of zoology; the idea of a science of man lay at the very heart of the Ideologists' concern. A perspective had been opened up for me, and from then on I had at hand a program of work. I knew in what direction to find the materials for metaphysical reflection. For the philoso- pher who - like Montaigne in his tower, or Descartes in his heated room - thinks that he has direct access to self-conscious- ness, discovers at the very lowest depths of his own self an indi- viduality that is consonant with the norms of his epoch. The very man who, like Descartes or Montaigne, thinks that he is breaking with the norms, derives his power over them from the fact that he is obeying them. Philosophy, insofar as it is under- standing and judgment of man by man, thus presupposes a history of the humanity of man, a development of that primordial con- sciousness and evaluation of the self which the ruling culture of- fers to every individual, and which, from one generation to the next, is imperceptibly transformed. In investigating the origins and developments in the social sciences, I was undertaking a kind of chronological inventory of the self-consciousness that is specific to Western man. This would be a historical piece of work, that would pass on the cor- related development of epistemology and of metaphysics. Up to that point, the history of philosophy had never offered any temp- tations to me. I saw in it a task for scholarship, whose philo- logical enslavement seemed to me to weigh far more heavily than the gain it might eventually produce. But suddenly the prob- lem that had been posed for me excited me. It was no longer, in effect, a matter of a history of philosophy, in the traditional meaning of the term, that is to say, a logical analysis of successive systems, in which one taxed one's ingenuity to break down doctrines so as to put them together again - the ultimate aim being to set the writer in opposition to himself and to his next-door neighbors. The area of my research was no</page><page sequence="21">106 SOCIAL RESEARCH longer the "no man's land" of theories - of placita philosophorum - in the shape of a logical exercise-room; it was the realm of human thought in search of itself, in all the forms that the ad- venture of understanding can take. The development of the sci- ences of man seemed to me like a mirror, in which man, from one age to the next, searches out his own image. Doctors, natur- alists, philologists, historians, anthropologists, economists - all these are the witnesses to, and at the same time the craftsmen of, the cultural consciousness of mankind. Their discoveries are the landmarks down the centuries of the renewals of man's values. It was therefore necessary to search through the history of the social sciences for the development of the image of man, as well as of the image of the world in which we live. But it soon enough became apparent to me that my own ignorance in this regard was easily to be accounted for in the light of the general ignorance of these questions, itself the expression of a complete lack of interest in them. At a time when the history of mathe- matics, astronomy, mechanics, physics, or chemistry has provided the occasion for a good many research studies in French - some- times, of great value - the history of the various social sciences still remains to be written. Here and there, there exist summaries, review articles, in which one or another specialist offers - in a few paragraphs, with a few names and a few dates - a sketch of what he believes to be the development of his own science. But anyone who has had the least experience in these matters soon enough discovers that these reviews duplicate one another; they are characterized in general by the fact that the author has no understanding of either the men or the books of which he is speaking. Most often, in addition, such an author confines himself to working out a sort of corporate folklore in the form of a distribu- tion of prizes: So-and-So discovered this; So-and-So developed that; and, by dint of truths amassed in this fashion, such-and-such</page><page sequence="22">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 107 discipline has arrived at the position of brilliance that one now finds it occupying. These ingenious revelations are altogether lacking in any sense of history: the writer imagines that his spe- cialty has existed forever; he is incapable of recognizing the relationship that it maintains, from one epoch to the next, with the dominant conceptions of knowledge. . . . This bibliographical deficiency is at once cause and effect; it is a token of the lack of interest evidenced, in France, in the history and epistemology of the social sciences. All of that is unexplored territory, which moreover in no sense provides ma- terial for either teaching or testing. Intellectual endeavor has a different orientation: one is always concerned with the same men, one always reads the same books - all of which means that other works, of no less importance, go on sleeping forever in the library stacks. I myself was the first one in the Library at Strasbourg to cut the pages of the Analytic System of the Positive Knowledge of Man y published in 1820 by the aged and inspired Lamarck; it is a curious and prophetic work, and not a single reader had ever felt any inclination to read it. It is true that one would search the catalogues of the Librairie Française in vain for a single work by Lamarck. There does exist a magnificent new edition of the Zoological Philosophy, a photocopy of the original; it was pub- lished in the United States. But no one would dream of devoting a doctoral dissertation to Lamarck; everybody thinks of taking as his subject the deduction of finite modes in Spinoza, Descartes' Cogito, or the consciousness of time in the philosophy of Husserl. Every science ought, by way of research into its origins and development, to deepen its own epistemological consciousness. A scholar without any history is like a man without a past. And I am forced to admit that, in this respect, the vast majority of our specialists are victims of amnesia. "These scholars/' wrote George Sarton, "can have legitimate pretensions to a complete and profound understanding of their own science - only if they</page><page sequence="23">108 SOCIAL RESEARCH know nothing of its history." In an even more decisive fashion, Blainville, the friend of Auguste Comte, wrote in 1845: "The history of science is science itself." One would have to insist quite strongly on this, for such a conception of the function of the history of knowledge requires a broadening even of the way in which the historical sciences are understood. Lord Acton asserted, with a great deal of justice, that history "is not only one particular branch of knowledge, but a specific mode, and a method of attaining knowledge, in the other branches. . . . Historical thought is broader than historical knowledge." It is important, moreover, to add that, if the Anglo-Saxon and the German enable us, in certain cases, to make up for the poverty of our bibliographies in French, there is much that is needed before the existing studies in those languages can be regarded as altogether satisfactory. One finds, in English, many histories of ethnology, anthropology, psychology or philology; there exist, in German, histories of medicine and of historiography. What is something of a drawback about these valuable pieces of work is the fact that each area appears in them to be self-contained, as if medicine or ethnology formed a sort of totality, which devel- oped in a purely autonomous fashion, each generation of physi- cians or chemists giving birth to the succeeding generation, and so on and so forth. This way of going about it has the defect of playing down the unity of knowledge, so that each discipline becomes endowed with an independent family tree. Yet the slightest examination, in any one instance, brings to light the interconnection among all the specialties in the "intellectual space" of a given epoch. No science of man can be isolated from all the others: the ideas, the topics, the doctrines, and even the scholars, moved around from one division to another, so much so that separate unity and con- tinuity in any branch whatsoever of the totality is the result only of an optical illusion.</page><page sequence="24">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUMANITY 109 To put it another way, the different social sciences are inter- dependent, one on another; their particular developments are inextricably criss-crossed - so much so that each of the social sciences finds its true meaning only in functioning together with all the others, in terms of a Science of Man that is unitary and generalized. This sort of statement has, to be sure, something hopeless about it. It is the very negation of the childish - and respectable - methods that have prevailed in the social sciences under the banner of "specialized scholarship/* The idea we have arrived at here is that, in order to be in a position to grasp the history of any one discipline, one would have to comprehend the history of all the others. To my way of thinking, this is beyond question. The history of historiography is not limited to the history of the historians; the history of biology is much more than the history of the biologists; and the history of political economy deals with events that take place, for the most part, outside the limits of economic life. That is why there is nothing more fruitless than the compendia that are published these days - under the misleading title of The History of Science (or, more modestly, History of the Sciences) - in which a certain number of scholars come together to unfold the development of their disciplines through the ages. These are decent folk, and they do what they can; but, to begin with, even if they are "up" on the present situation in their own areas of competence, they are, in general, totally without any sense of history or historical framework of thought. Furthermore, they have the illusion that physics, biology, or ethnography - having made their appearance at a given moment - developed without any break, following the lines of force of a growth that was specifically biological or ethnographical, and isolated from the rest of the surrounding culture. Each science brings its own pebble to the heap of pebbles; Science is the sum of the sciences. This way of going about the job is an indescribable absurdity.</page><page sequence="25">110 SOCIAL RESEARCH It conceals the very thing that it professes to throw light upon: the progress of knowledge through the growth of mankind. Ad- mittedly, this is no simple question. The goal of reconstituting the history of the science of man has its counterpart in the goal of erecting the Tower of Babel. One can now understand why the eminent German thinker Ernst Cassirer, who had devoted himself in his own writings to revealing the unity of human significances, could declare, in the last days of his life, at a time when he had had to emigrate to the United States, "The history of the philosophy of man is still a desidera- tum. Whereas the history of metaphysics, of natural philosophy, of ethical and scientific thought, has been studied in all detail, we are here still at the beginning." In the same way, the German specialist Erich Rothacker remarks that the history of the social sciences "has never been set forth in its totality in a coordinated way." These formulations define adequately enough the purpose of my new undertaking. It was a matter of writing a book that could not be written. To carry such a project through to its com- pletion, it would doubtless have been more advantageous to await the evening of a life that had been devoted to exhaustive research for documentation; yet, at just that moment, the old man gives up, for he has reached the age when one draws back from attempting the impossible. I had no desire to wait, for waiting, delay, was a form of hiding. The Introduction to the Social Sciences was not to be either a treatise on epistemology, nor a history of the sciences nor of philosophy but, to tell the truth, a little of all of them - more exactly, an essay in the history of ideas, or rather in the history of culture. Philosophers were to play a role in it side by side with scholars; moreover, it happens that for a long time the scholars are philosophers and the philosophers scholars. The science in each epoch is closely linked with its art, its religion, its philosophy, in the quite complete fashion of life itself, within the bosom of the same cultural context. Every setting forth in</page><page sequence="26">METAPHYSICS TO META-HUM ANITY 111 science is, for consciousness, an arrival, a broadening of the human horizon. I had never had, until then, any temptation to do the work of the historian. This time, however, I was caught in the trap of my own curiosity. Yet for this one would have had to possess a manifold competence; it would have been necessary, in order to make a suitable rendering of the matter, to be a specialist in all the specialties with whose fate I was concerned. I was neither physician, nor biologist, nor anthropologist, nor ethnologist, nor economist, nor philologist, etc., etc., ... If I had possessed one or another of these qualifications, the probability is that I would not have assumed the risk of writing such a book. The question to be decided was whether the book had to be written. I thought so, and I wrote it. The fact is that it now appears to me that the movement of thought in the field of the social sciences has a rather simple mode of organization. The earliest model of knowledge was the New- tonian prototype, which was regarded as having the right to be authoritative everywhere. It was dominant in the eighteenth century; on the strength of the Encyclopedia, it gave the Ideolo- gists their motive impulse; and it carried over into the nine- teenth century, with positivism and scientism. In this perspective, the social sciences should be regarded as sciences of the nature of man, organized in accordance with the norms of an objective intelligibility. At the end of the eighteenth century there were revealed the principles of a new interpretation, according to which the human reality depends on a specific hermeneutic: man is to be under- stood as a person, not as a thing. That is the principle of the school of "understanding" which developed, especially in Ger- many, during the course of the nineteenth century. Those who traveled this second route were led to maintain that the sciences of man are human sciences, and that it would therefore be wrong for them to kill the object of their examination, on some "princi- pled* ' basis, before they even got to examining it. This is no</page><page sequence="27">112 SOCIAL RESEARCH question of the dissection of corpses, but of regaining possession of man's being, in concerning oneself with man as he functions among men. This latter position seemed to me to be the one to be preferred; it was necessary to demonstrate that it won out over the earlier one in terms of merit. By way of history and epistemology, this investigation was striking at the very essence and meaning of the human condition. In that fashion, the letters of nobility of the social sciences were properly highlighted. I had no hope of convincing the spe- cialists, who were stuck in their ruts, prisoners of well-estab- lished routines. My intent was rather to awaken reflection in the young people, seekers in the realm of the sciences or of philos- ophy. These would be able to be bidden to take hold of the consciousness of the unity of man, as a direction and a demand. For that unity is a state of thinking: if it is not asserted at the inception of one's researches, one can be quite certain that it will not turn up in their conclusion.</page></plain_text>
