Reviewed by Justin Stearns, Department of Religion, Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vt.; e-mail: jstearns@middlebury.edu doi: 10. 1017/S0020743808081075 In English-language surveys of the history of Muslim Iberia, the Almohads have traditionally received comparatively short shrift. Authors with as disparate approaches as Richard Fletcher and Maria Rosa Menocal have characterized the religious and political movement founded by Ibn Tumart (d. 524/1130) as "fundamentalist" and "puritan," framing it historiographically in opposition to the earlier Umayyad caliphate and the subsequent fractured political landscape of the party kingdoms. In these narratives, the Almohads and their fellow Berber predecessors, the Almoravids, are understood to have put an end to the golden age of convivencia in al-Andalus, and the Almohads' ultimate historical significance is largely reduced to their admittedly strict application of legal injunctions against Jewish and Christian minorities and the dramatic burn- ing of the books of the philosopher Averroes only a few years before his death. A reader of such surveys could easily be forgiven for thinking that these fundamentalist Berbers were remarkable only for the expansion of their political control and that when their rule collapsed a century after the death of their founder, they would hereafter be thought of as an anomaly with little connection to the intellectual and political orders that preceded and followed them. In the two volumes under consideration the editors have succeeded in bringing together a remarkable collection of thirty-eight articles addressing almost every facet of the Almohad movement. The result of three conferences held in Madrid at the Casa de Velasquez between 2000 and 2002, these articles succeed admirably in furthering our understanding of precisely how the Almohads can be properly understood only in light of their relationship with previous political, economic, cultural, and intellectual orders and how much they influenced the societies</page><page sequence="2">492 Int. J. Middle East Stud. 40 (2008) that followed their disappearance. With the exception of two articles written in English and one in Arabic, the contributions to these volumes are almost evenly split between scholarship published in French and Spanish and can be taken as the "state of the field" of research on the Almohads in France, Spain, and Morocco. With some notable exceptions - including the excellent contributions to this collection by Frank Griffel and Madeleine Fletcher - if this is the state of the field in Europe, American academics working on the Almohads, and not just those writing introductory surveys of al-Andalus, have a good deal of catching up to do. Over ten years ago, underscoring the importance of the work of French historian Pierre Guichard, Thomas Glick wrote: "It appears that an entire generation of English-speaking historians of Medieval Spain has lost control of the research front at the same time" (From Muslim Castle to Christian Fortress, 1995, p. xiii). His comment would have been equally apt in this case. Following the topics of the congresses, the two volumes are preceded by an extensive intro- duction and overview by Patrice Cressier, Maribel Fierro, and Pierre Guichard and then divided thematically into three sections: the ideological expression of the Almohad message in material culture (art, epigraphy, numismatics, and architecture); the political and military structuring of Almohad society; and intellectual, doctrinal, and religious aspects of Almohad history. How do these various sections approach and address what the authors of the introduction refer to as "the most grandiose, most sophisticated and most original [movement] that took place in the history of the Muslim West, as well as one of the most interesting within the immense historical reach of Islam" (p. xv)? Due to space constraints, I highlight some contributions over others without wishing to give the appearance of privileging individual articles. In the first section, Maria Antonia Martinez Nunez provides a detailed examination of Almohad inscriptions, noting their extensive use of Qur'anic quotations for inscriptions in monumental architecture in general - not only in mosques - that distinguished them from their Umayyad predecessors (p. 24). Most striking perhaps was their use of phrases clearly asso- ciated with Shi'i Islam and the family of the Prophet (pp. 23, 35; on this see also Fierro, p. 908). The inclusion of numerous photographs of representative inscriptions for this article as well as many others in this section is a welcome and useful addition to the arguments presented here. In separate contributions, both Salvador Fontenla and Marianne Barrucand focus on the ways in which the Almohads distinguished themselves from their predecessors in material production, most famously with their use of the square in both coinage (Fontenla, p. 53) and Qur'anic frontispieces (Barrucand, pp. 74, 91), but also with their popularization of the naskhl script to distinguish themselves from their Almoravid predecessors (Fontenla, p. 62). Patrice Cressier stresses the Almohad use of the construction of massive gates to project their ideological project and traces the Almohad use of the ornamental scallop shell back through Almoravid precedents to the Cordoban Umayyad caliphate (p. 167). Christian Ewert, for his part, demonstrates the continuities between Umayyad, Almoravid, and even Abbasid architecture and that of the Almohads, noting that "the transition to Almohad art, of an undeniable purist tendency, is a much more organic process than the irruption of the new fundamentalist ideology of Ibn Tumart" (p. 225). Julio Navarro Palaz6n and Pedro Jimenez Castillo challenge the perception of some historians that artistic production under the Almohads consisted of a break from a previous Hispanic tradition. Instead, the authors argue that art under the Almohads provided the basis for the subsequent efforts of both the Nasrids and Merinids. In the second section, Constant Hames, drawing on the cIbar of Ibn Khaldun, provides a close reading of how the famed historian's depiction of Ibn Tumart and his Mu'minid successors was determined by his writing his history with the patronage of the Hafsids - self-proclaimed successors to the Almohads. Particularly striking in this article is Hames 's observation that Almohad succession began according to a matrilineal Berber model, only to shift with the Mu'minids to a patrilineal Arab model that Ibn Khaldun took pains to</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 493 legitimate (p. 448). Manuela Marin shows clearly how the Almohad leader moved within his realm in order to establish his legitimacy by addressing the complaints of subjects, as well as how some Andalus notables managed the transition into the ranks of the new Almohad elites, the talaba and the huffaz (p. 463). Halima Ferhat notes that the same was true in North Africa and that there was a great deal of continuity in terms of families who exercised positions of influence under both dynasties (p. 686), although new elements, including former Christians, also formed part of the new elite (p. 696). Vincent Lagardere describes how Ibn Tumart described jihad as a personal obligation that should be fulfilled against heterodox (i.e., non-Almohad) Muslims prior to non-Muslims. Ultimately, Lagardere observes, the tendency to direct jihad against other Muslims, such as the Almoravids, played a crucial role in the downfall of the Almohad movement (p. 629). The third and longest of the three sections is also the most impressive, and the articles collected here form the sine qua non of any future research into Almohad intellectual history. Whereas Frank Griffel notes the unlikelihood of the famous meeting between Ibn Tumart and al-Ghazali (p. 755) - in a similar fashion to Sarah Stroumsa's skepticism regarding Averroes 's meeting with the Almohad caliph al-Mansur (p. 1141) - he argues at length for the value of situating Ibn Tumart as an Ashcari within the intellectual environment of the Nizamiyya Mosque in Baghdad, where al-Ghazali taught (p. 756ff). Delflna Serrano, in showing the prevalence and acceptance of Ashcari beliefs under both Almoravids and Almohads, argues cogently that the Almohads inaccurately and opportunistically accused their predecessors of supporting the doctrine of anthropomorphism (p. 846). A series of excellent contributions closely examine the degree to which Averroes can be considered a proponent of Almohad doctrine, with Marc Geoffrey arguing that the famous thinker's enthusiasm for this cause waned over time (p. 880ff) and Sarah Stroumsa noting that both Averroes and Maimonides were attracted to the Almohads' interest in "fundamentals" (p. 1156). In her analysis of Almohad influence on Aquinas, Madeleine Fletcher argues, with possible overconfldence, that Almohad theological and philosophical thought had substantial influence on 13th-century Western European Christian theology (pp. 1175ff). Maribel Fierro offers a masterful overview of legal doctrine and practice under the Almohads, noting that the Almohads' desire to "return to the origins" implied a rejection of centuries of accumulated religious practice in the Muslim West. Although they found some support for their vision, in the end the memory of local religious practice proved too strong for their reforms to find lasting acceptance (pp. 929-30). To conclude, we can return to the introduction of this excellent collection of articles: "How to respond to the inevitable question of why the collapse of the Almohads came about? We may ask ourselves if it is not in the very originality of the movement that permitted its predominance and flourishing, serving as its power base, that one should look for the ultimate cause of its weaknesses and disappearance ..."
