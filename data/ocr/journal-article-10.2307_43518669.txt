<plain_text><page sequence="1">PUMPKIN-HEAD PARAGRAPHS Norma J. Engberg University of Nevada (Las Vegas) Students have been told over and over again about the four kinds of sentences: simple, compound, complex, and com- pound -complex. They have been asked to identify them; they have been asked to construct them. But seldom are they told how to use their ability with sentence types to improve their own writing. In spite of their instructor s admonitions and advice, students continue to write paragraphs full of simple independent clauses joined with the easy conjunction and . Nouns, verbs, and modifiers - we talk about them for hours: how to recognize them, how to use them, what they mean. We invent exercises using the dictionary; we lecture briefly on the history of the language; we count syllables. Words are abstract or concrete, general or specific; they are also rated socially. In spite of all our talking, we continue to find words misused because students fail to understand their meaning or their position on the ladder of abstration. What is needed is a demonstration in which specific ail- ments of sentence structure and word choice are discovered and treated. The instructor can show the students how to write and rewrite a short paragraph, working with an ear for audi- ence comments in the classroom. One such series I call "pump- kin-head paragraphs," and I begin with one in which every sentence patterns subject + verb 4- object. The pumpkin needs a face. I realize its undefined character. Jagged teeth fill the mouth. Triangle nose and eyes complete the effect. A candle provides light. Dark- ness assures contrast. Now I see only a grinning glow. Three changes in punctuation convert these seven clauses into four sentences, two of which are compound. The pumpkin needs a face. I realize its undefined character: jagged teeth fill the mouth; triangle nose and eyes complete the effect . A candle provides light, and darkness assures contrast. Now I see only a grinning glow. Sentence number two, which now contains three independent clauses, illustrates the use of the colon to indicate that the following material - the clauses establishing teeth, nose, and eyes - explains what the writer means by making the pump- kin s undefined character real. The third sentence illustrates the all-tòo- familiar coordinate conjunction (cj) and comma, but here at least, they are used to join two clauses whose strictly parallel structure reinforces parallels in content. Short simple sentences are retained to introduce and to close the paragraph. Still, the repeating of identical sentence patterns is monoto- nous, and certain kinds of information cannot be conveyed. Therefore, I move on to my second version: S V IO DO A purposefully carved face gives the pumpkin personality. S V O S be Adj It assumes a clearly defined character. The teeth are irregular, S be Adj jaewd. The eye-and-nose vents are precisely triangular. A S V Adv: prepP S V candle stands (inside the hollow.) A glowing grin pierces the O gathering darkness. Each of the six is a simple sentence, but what had been a consistent repetition of S+V-fO is relieved by the introduction of three additional patterns: S+V-HD4-DO. S-fV+be+Adj. S+V+Adv. Beneath the surface structure of the NP:det + adj:pptc + N ( purposefully carved face , a clearly defined character) lie two clauses:</page><page sequence="2">16 A face is purposefully carved. The carving is purposeful Similarly, in sentence two: A character is defined. The definition is clear. In both cases, the past participle, a non-finite verb form, pre- supposes an actor or agent, who remains unidentified. Who carves the face? Who defines its character? The writer, we assume, but he does not here identify himself as he did in the second sentence of the first version. Other matters of word choice which may be pointed out include the contrast between irregular , jagged at the end of the third sentence and precisely triangular at the end of the fourth. The first is a pair of adjectives; the second, an -ly adverb with adjective. Someone will suggest irregularly jagged as being parallel to the second phrasing, but others will feel that this formal similarity is excessive: if there are two such constructions located so near each other, the rhythm detracts from the sense. The word triangular here used as a predicative adjective begs comparison with its attributive use in the first paragraph. However, there in the phrase triangle nose and eyes it is the noun form, not the adjective form, which is found. This gives the teacher a chance to point out the strange freedom that writers of English have to alter the function of a word without altering its form. I ask the difference between the phrases grinning glow in paragraph No. 1 and glowing grin in No. 2. Students feel that grinning glow is the more figurative and the more imagina- tive: a glow of candlelight illuminates the whole pumpkin, but the cut mouth makes the dominant impression. The second phrase sees only the grin, which being candlelit glows as a disembodied smile. Another good discussion can surround the question of an- tecedent for the pronoun it in sentence two. Do personality , pumpkin , or face assume a clearly defined character? Someone always brings up the old rule, that we should go back to the nearest noun, personality. Others argue that the pumpkin has no character before it is cut; the carved face is the only* evi- dence of character. Of course, to assign a pumpkin character in the first place is an anthropomorphic figure which implies human characteristics in a vegetable. Three changes in punctuation convert these six clauses into three compound sentences. ~~ A purposefully carved face gives the pumpkin per- sonality, and it assumes a clearly defined character. The teeth are irregular, jagged, but the eye-and-nose vents are precisely triangular. A candle stands inside the hol- low, and a glowing grin pierces the gathering darkness. Clauses which are only coordinated are also monotonous; in- formation about the sequence of events, about relationships of cause and effect cannot be conveyed without the use of de- pendent clauses. This brings me to the third version, a six- clause, three-sentence paragraph. (Since, as) - Because a purposefully carved face gives the pumpkin personality, it takes on a clearly defined character. Al- though the teeth are irregular and jagged, the eye-and- (When, once) nose vents are precisely triangular. After a candle lights the hollow, a glowing grin pierces the gathering darkness. The first subordinating conjunction (sj) because suggests cause and effect and is defined as 'for the reason or cause thať; on account of the fact thať. As is a broader, more generalized sj suggesting in addition to the causal, 'to the same amount or degree thať; 'in the same manner thať; 'at the same time thať. Since is a time sj, defined as 'during the period following the time when* and continuously from the time when*. At the second point of multiple choice, the beginning of the third sentence, after , also a time word, suggests 'following the time when'; 'later than . When indicates 'at the time thať; 'as soon as'; once means 'as soon as*. This second example involves a sequence of events: the candle must light the hollow interior of the pumpkin before its light can shine forth from the pumpkins cut face. The first example, implying a causal relationship between the two c'auses, alters the meaning of the sentence. This is felt espe- cially in questioning the pronoun it. Here, unlike the earlier versions, the antecedent is most likely pumpkin. The Latin verb assumes is replaced by native take with ad- verb on; while this substitution does not seem to alter the meaning, it does alter the tone. Native monosyllabic words generally convey a simplicity, even a naivete, not felt with learned and abstract Latinisms. Another verb that could be used here is acquires; subtle differences among these three point up fine shades of meaning and may be illustrated by using them in sentences; such as He - a new identity. He - wealth and power. He - another job. irregular, jagged in the second version becomes here irreg- ular and jagged. This is the commoner way of handling two ad- jectives. Omitting the cj in version two caused the two adjec- tives to "bump," and this abrupt movement emphasized the pair. Further, if version two had employed the cj here, the whole sentence would have read . . . irregular and jagged , but . . . , and the juxtaposition of two cj would have been irri- tating, if not confusing/ ' Although , defined as 'in spite of the fact that; granting thať, when it heads a subordinate clause, introduces an opposition between it and the independent clause. Here the writer is saying: "Just because the teeth are irregular and jagged, you needn't expect the eye-and-nose vents to be the same way." More often, the choice of although calls for a negative in die main clause: Although (until) a purposefully carved face gives the pumpkin personality, it cannot take on a clearly defined character. The jagged teeth are irregular, although the eye-and-nose vents are precisely triangular. Until (al- though) candlelight illumines the hollow, the glowing grin cannot turn the gathering tide of darkness. Although is causal; until, however, is temporal, meaning 'up- to the time thať, or spatial 'to the point, degree, or place thať. It is possible to use either sj in the context, but the difference in meaning is great. Students considering this distinction care- fully realize that these two cannot be considered interchange- able, as we did the sets of three sj discussed in the third version of the paragraph. A few variations in word choice appear in this version also. JagRe¿ has changed from the predicative to the attributive position with respect to its noun. The subject plus verb candle lights becomes the noun, candlelight , and the abstract, Latinate illumines is supplied to the verb slot. Turn the tide is a familiar metaphor (cliche?) comparing the gathering darkness to the rush of the sea. One could easily wish for an occasional simple sentence or even a sentence fragment here to break up the series of com- plex sentences. Each change from simple to compound, from compound to complex has at first seemed an improvement Then we realize that we have gone too far. The best paragraph</page><page sequence="3">17 contains a mixture of sentences, and the students enjoy putting together a final revision which combines the various alterna- tives I have demonstrated. Thus students are shown the questions the writer asks as he re- views his manuscript. We proceed from uniformity to variety in sentence pattern, from coordination to subordination of clausal elements. As a secondary issue we look at the standard punctuation, the placement of adjective detail. Transforma- tional-generative linguistics contributes information about deep and surface structure and about the ability of words to change part of speech. A careful inquiry into synonyms shows that in pcruaHty there aren't any: words are never exactly alike and the subtle differences command the writer's attention. Going step by step through this process of revision helps the students to see alternative ways, equally "correct," of saying the same thing. Choice among these alternatives is the expression of individual personality and the exercise of style. Students glimpsing the distinction between the acceptable and the at- tractive set higher standards for themselves, become more critical of what they read, and help me turn the course into a "writers' workshop." Any demonstration for class room use must also have two other features: it must not be too long if it is to hold the students' attention, and it must phrase a common experience in such a way as to arouse their curosity.</page></plain_text>
