GOD, WORLD AND MAN INTRODUCTION The relation of God and the universe in Judaism involves two conceptions: the Transcendence of God and the Imman ence of the universe in God. These are not paradoxical doc trines, however. God is above the universe, Judaism teaches, and beyond it. He is not identical with the universe as a totality nor with any part of it. He does not partake of its nature, nor is He subject to its laws. He is completely independent of it. But the universe is not independent of Him. It has no existence except insofar as He wills its existence, for He is not only its. Creator but also its Maintainer. He has called it into being from nothing and its continued existence is contingent upon His will. The Immanence of the universe in God means that the continuous activity of God upon the universe keeps it from dissolving into the nothingness from which it originated. These doctrines are the metaphysical foundations of the Jewish faith.1 What does all this metaphysics mean as religion? What are the implications of the Transcendental Deity and the universe that dwells in God for the religio-ethical world-view? I The doctrine of Transcendence frees God from subjection to any inexorable Fate. It emancipates Him from the limita tions imposed by any existent outside of Him. God is recog nized as a free Agent, limitless in His creative potencies, recre ating and refashioning the world ever anew. The God Who is Himself untrammeled is the Creator of freedom. Man's free dom is a derivative of God's freedom. 37</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought The God Who is not bound by the universe must have pre ceded it in time. Hence the doctrine of Creatio ex Nihilo. Since God is not delimited by any existent outside of Him, including the created universe, and His creative activity never ceases, the possibilities for the universe are never exhausted. Instead of being a closed system, the universe becomes a growing, expand ing, and limitless enterprise.2 Transcendence and Immanence, in this manner, prove themselves mutually complementary, rather than paradoxical, doctrines. The doctrine of Creatio ex Nihilo as a religious principle connotes the establishment of a Power beyond the universe in whom the meaning of existence should be sought. The signi ficance of things should not be sought in any single aspect, nor in the totality, of the universe itself. It is not discoverable there. Since God has created the world, He has invested it with mean ing. But this ultimate meaning can be known to none but God. Since God is by His very nature unknowable, and Divine ultim ates cannot be translated into human terms, it is futile to attempt to discover the purpose of existence which He has brought into being. A pantheistic world-view implies that the universe known to the intellect is an end in itself, since it is God. To the theist, however, it is a means. The end is God. Everything else is a means to this end.3 At the same time, the idea of God endows the universe with meaning, of which it is deprived in any athe istic system. Purpose and end presuppose a Being Who bears a relationship to mind and Who can impose meaning upon the world. The doctrine of Creation, moreover, implies that "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein."4 The universe is His possession.5 As an ethical theorem this principle means that the world and all that is therein are to be treated as a Divine creation. It is written:6 For he who loves an individual loves all his creations and works. The value that attaches to existence derives from the fact that God the Creator has endowed the universe with His holiness. The universe or anything it contains may, consequently, not be 38</page><page sequence="3">God, World and Man employed, for purposes not designated by its Maker. He is its Master and the Dispenser of all its rights. No creature, by the very nature of things, has any prerogatives over the other except such as are allowed by God. Even the employment of vegeta tion for food had to receive such a sanction.7 Only from the fact that the universe has been created by God can we derive a moral purpose inherent in the universe. Although this purpose may not be the ultimate one—it is the only one intelligible to man and meaningful to him—the aware ness of its presence can alone make righteousness in tune with reality. It is God alone Who can give us the assurance that morality and right are a real factor in the universe, a factor that makes a difference. If, on the other hand, theism is the ground for value im manent in the universe, it also prevents the indiscriminate deifi cation of all aspects of nature—good and bad. By severing God from the world, the recognition of the reality of evil as a factor in the universe to be overcome and sublimated is made possible. It is He Who distinguishes between dark and light, between the holy and the profane, and between the pure and the unclean.8 It is He Who is concomitantly the Creator and the Separater.9 It is He Who has created evil,10 not as an eternal manifestation of His nature, but as a temporary episode in the process of cosmic and human development, to be overcome and banished from the world, by human action. Theism assures us that moral ity is not out of place in this world, and that existence as a whole partakes of God's holiness. But, at the same time, it does not compel us to acquiesce in, and blind our eyes to, the evil as pects of creation. It, nevertheless, assures as that the right and the good will ultimately triumph, when evil will have been eliminated or transfigured into good. [I (iod is One. The transcendent God Whose Will alone is sov ereign must be the only God. He alone created the world and He alone maintains it. It is in Him that the universe is truly such a unity. It is He alone Who gives it meaning, plan, direc 39</page><page sequence="4">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought tion. In Him everything serves its purpose—even the evil to be overcome by man.11 Through Him alone the triumph of the good is assured. It is the unity of God that makes the moral life possible. The essence of moral activity is the subordination of impulse and its employment as an instrument for a broader end—the good of all creation. In polytheism and pantheism, insofar as these systems are consistent with themselves, moral activity is meaningless. In pantheism evil is as much imbedded in the structure of the universe as good. In the case of poly theism an eternal struggle between conflicting forces, all pri mordial, goes on. The victory of good over evil is thus an im possibility. The cyclic character of history in these systems per haps derives from the fact that any ultimate and abiding trans formation of reality must be ruled out. The morality that exists in non-theistic systems is the result of the monotheistic glimmer, or is the vestige of a primeval revelation. That evil itself is not absolutely so and that no hard-and fast line of demarcation between good and evil need be drawn is likewise a consequence of the doctrine of the One God. In polytheism the domain of the good is absolutely distinct from the domain of evil and no trespassing of one into the other is possible. In monotheism the conception is possible that good and evil merge into each other, that evil is a lesser degree of good, that the raw material of nature and the basic stuff of human life are morally neutral, but become morally differen tiated only as a result of man's operation upon them. The natural impulses are thus not regarded as evil per se. They are such only when not employed for proper ends. In monotheism, value attaches to man's body as well as to his spirit.12 The transcendent God Who is One must necessarily be in corporeal.13 If He is to exceed limitation, He must even trans cend all categories of spirit as they are revealed to man's limited mind. This recognition is fundamental not merely for meta physical, but, even more so, for ethical, considerations. To con ceive of God as corporeal will easily lead to a corruption of the moral contents of the God-idea. God will come to be regarded as a superhuman being partaking both of human frailties and human virtues, and a consequent deterioration of the concept 40</page><page sequence="5">Crod, World and Man oi Imitatio Dei, which is basic in theistic ethics, will result. The God-idea must be preserved in its purity, unsullied by an thropomorphic or anthropopathic fallacies. The depersonalization of God which the doctrine of trans cendence logically carries with it and that elevates the Deity beyond good and evil, would result in an a-ethical system, were it not for the doctrine of the immanence of the universe in God which brings the transcendent God into relationship with the universe. More specifically, the doctrine of creation determines the character of God's activity, if not of God Himself and thus defines the nature and scope of morality based on Imitatio Dei. God creates and preserves the macrocosm. It is man's duty to do the same in his microcosm. The attributes of God are simply those activities of His that make for the preservation of the universe, whether these attributes are qualities of mercy or of justice.14 In this sense, morality means not the escape from life, but rather the enhancement, the preservation, and the perpetua tion of life. The God Who is the Creator and the Only One demands a reverent attitude towards all aspects of His creation. There are no neutral areas in the universe. Though there are grada tions within creation, there is no vacuum therein. In the uni verse of the One God we are assured that there is a sanctity that pervades its entirety, not the fetishistic sanctity of pan theism, which derives from the mere fact that a thing is, but because of the relationship it stands to God. The closer the relationship to God, the greater the sanctity. The God Who is One is not the great leveller as is the All that is One. As the Creator he excludes not the smallest of His creatures from the scope of His preservative grace. This grace of God which fills the earth15 establishes the universe as a cosmos. The dismem bered world of polytheism in which the conflicts going on in the physical domain and the spiritual realm behind it make impossible harmony and cooperation between the parts that are fused into one in the monotheistic world. In a cosmos the raison d'etre of polytheism is done away with. 41</page><page sequence="6">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought Ill God loves the world, and in His goodness maintains it and provides for its sustenance.18 Not a single item is excluded from the sphere of Divine interest since everything exists for a pur pose. All creation stands at the service of its Maker and fulfills His holy Will.17 The Revelation of God's Will manifests itself in the realm of the inanimate and the inarticulate as well as in the life of man. God has imposed His law and order upon the physical world. All creatures are kept within their limits by the bounds of natural law. All creatures obey the Will of God and observe His commandments.18 In this way they fulfill the pur pose for which they have been brought into being. Revelation at its lowest level is the imposition of a Divine order upon the physical and biological world. It is in the demand for law and order in the life of man that Revelation reaches its full meaning. The presupposition of Rev elation as the self-unfoldment of God to man is man's ability to communicate with God. Man must first strive to reach God and learn His Will, and only then will God reveal Himself. God does not manifest Himself in vacuo. Israel had to prepare itself before He spoke at Sinai. No individual can attain the pro phetic state unless he has reached the highest degree of physical, moral and intellectual excellency. God does not reveal Himself to the coward, ignorant, or reprobate. Revelation is thus an interaction between God and man. Man aspires to God's truth and he is answered from above.19 God is the source of the Law that is binding on all men. It is His character as Creator and Maintainer that determines His relationship to the universe. In so far as this is true, the moral law embodied in His revelation must have its contents deter mined as to its essence by the very nature of God, and, conse quently, must have its origin in Him. That man, of his own ac cord, could attain an understanding of the Alimghty, Who is beyond all comprehension, and of His relation to the world, with the resultant unfoldment of the truly purposive human conduct, that man could achieve all this without the aid of rev elation, is incredible. 42</page><page sequence="7">God, World and Man The postulate that the physical and subhuman world conform to a Divine revelation implies that the universe is rational. The One God Who is the source of law and order informs the entire universe with a unity and relatedness that make it intelligible to orderly human minds. In such a world there is no place for contingency or a haphazard organization of things. The world apprehended by mind is the one that is created by mind. The wondrous events whereby the Divine breaks through the world of phenomena do not constitute an infringement on the law and order that prevail in the world. These apparent anomalies are the product of the interrelationship of the physical laws of the natural order and the laws of man's behavior on a level where the ultimate goals of human existence govern the pro cession of events. It is because man is not exposed to the compulsion inherent in the universe at large that a special relationship between him and the world about him has been established by the Creator. Man, like the rest of creation, is subject to order. But this order is of an entirely different nature. Like nature, man's life may be rational, but he is also free to remove his life from the sphere of rationality. Man is controlled neither by external nature nor by internal heredity fully and completely. His con trolling agency is primarily his own will. The human will is not free in the sense that it is subject to chance and does not participate in the universal reign of law and order. It is free inasmuch as it can act without external compulsion and can generate activity in the light of its knowledge of consequences and its choice between conflicting values. Man thus can over come those aspects of his nature that lead to impulsive, uncon trolled, and thus irrational, behavior. For man, rational be havior means not that which is understood by mind, but that which is governed by it. The nature of the extra-human world is not subject to changes of its own making. Man can himself change his course of action by bending his proclivities into the right channels through the medium of knowledge. By taking cognizance of the Divine Law for man and the consequences for his own actions, he may sub ject himself to the law and order which constitute the revealed 43</page><page sequence="8">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought Law of God. This power of man—to submit knowingly to God's revealed Will—chiefly constitutes man's individuality and uniqueness. Only by recognizing himself as bound by duties relating to God, his fellow-man, and the world about him does man attain his full stature as a human being. It is the acknowledgement of himself as a ben-mitzvot that makes the human being. Race, color, and station and other fortuitous circumstances are of no account. The duties are not the same for all. Some are subject to more and some to less. But one's essential humanity is not minimized in the least by the fact that one has fewer duties to perform. Living up, or at least attempting to do so, to whatever is incumbent upon the individual is the only prerequisite for that person's immortal place in the scheme of things. The individual is of supreme importance. But the behavior of the world about us is contingent upon the conduct of society. A society of righteous men will bring upon itself the blessings of God. The whole natural order will be brought into harmony with the needs of man. Physical well-being, prosperity, longev ity, and peace will be the lot of the members of this society. The righteous conduct of men raises the moral tone of the whole creation. It will transform the character even of the wild animals.20 Man's righteousness elevates God's creation to its intended glory. Man's wickedness, however, degrades it. When men become corrupt, the elements respond and bring havoc and disaster upon the world. The transgression of God's com mandments results in war, hunger, and devastation. This inter relation between the forces of nature and the conduct of men is an integral part of the law and order that the Creator has im posed upon His world.21 The individual, righteous though he may be, does not always escape the fate of the immoral society. The world is so constituted that individual retribution may not always be achieved within the present scheme of things.22 Future retribution is thus an indispensable corollary of God's righteous ness. That the soul is, by its own nature, immortal is contrary to monotheism. Only God is eternal. The soul is a created entity 44</page><page sequence="9">God, World and Man and as such partakes of the transiency of all created things. It is, however, endowed with the possibility of immortality by its Creator. God does not destroy the life that He has invested with His sanctity. The soul that directs the personality into the channels of righteousness acquires for itself a portion in eternal life, whereas the soul that defiantly cuts itself off from the source of its life loses the grounds for its immortality. The personality of the ungodly is cut off because it lacks the ground for en during progress. The righteous whose activities are directed towards the perfection of God's world have gained a basis for peristence beyond death and for never ending progress to higher and higher levels.23 Every human being can contribute to the sum-total of moral value in the universe and thus become a source of blessing to all of God's creatures. He may, on the other hand, retard the progress of the world by ignoring God and His commandments. In the hand of every individual thus lies the destiny of God's creation. For when moral value preponderates, the world is heading towards perfection; when moral ill prevails, the world is on its way to doom .To turn the tide, one single act may be sufficient.24 In a certain sense, the retribution of an individual is em bodied within the structure of the universe. The righteous con tributes to the sum-total of the good and thus immortalizes himself. The wicked whose deeds disturb the equilibrium of the world and cause its foundations to totter cast themselves into perdition. In the fullness of time, when the good will emerge victorious and evil will no longer be, the names of the allies of evil will be deleted from the book of the Lord.25 Man can sink to the depths. But he can also rise to lofty heights. The saints whose lives are the embodiment of the Divine Word, of whatever faith or station they may be, are the mainstay of the world. These chosen spirits are the assurance that God's purpose in the creation of humanity will be fulfilled.26 They stand in the presence of God not as individuals but as the symbols of God's realized vision of man. They lift mankind with them to Him Who dwells on high, and in so doing they change the destiny of the world. 45</page><page sequence="10">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought IV The ultimate nature of God can never be known. To know God one must be God.27 The universe may also never disclose its true nature to man. Is the universe real or illusory? Is it matter or mind or both? These questions remain unanswered and they are not vital to our religious philosophy. We are con cerned with the world as it presents itself to our senses and as it is interpreted by mind. It is with this sensuous world, regard less of its ultimate nature, that we are dealing, and it is with this kind of world that Revelation concerns itself. Nor are we concerned with the ultimate nature of Deity. We acknowledge that He is beyond all categories of space, time, and extension, nay, beyond all forms of thought and spirit envisioned by man's limited mind. His essence is beyond all comprehension.28 Our concern in Him, however, is as the God of Creation, Providence and Revelation, not as a metaphysical entity or scientific and philosophic hypothesis. It is in His coming in relation with the universe that God assumes ethical and religious significance.29 It is only God's concern for the world and mankind that en dows both with sanctity. And it is from God's relation to the world that we derive the register of virtues which human beings are to follow, and which is to serve as the basis of that life in which man fulfills his purpose as a human being to the end known to none but God. NOTES 1. Maimonides, Yesodei Ha-Torah, I, 1-2. I use the expression "the imman ence of the world in God" rather than the accepted "immanence of God in the world," because the former is more in conformity with the Biblical-Midrashic conception which envisages God as the Place of the world (Makom). See Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:1; Genesis Rabbah 68, 9. The concept of Shekhi nah (the dwelling of God in the midst of men) represents a unique relation ship not between God and the universe, but between God and mankind, and later, between God and Israel. A discussion of this concept must be left for another opportunity. 46</page><page sequence="11">God, World and Man 2. Cf. Rabbi Kook, Orot Ha-Kodesh, Vol. II, p. 529 ff., and notes on p. 637 ff. 3.
