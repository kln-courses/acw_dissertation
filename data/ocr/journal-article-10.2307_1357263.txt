<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Evolution of the Chalcolithic Painted Style DIANE L. BOLGER Frankfurt, Germany Structural analysis of painted design on pottery has been used by anthropologists to measure degrees of intersite interaction. In this article, design structures of Red- on- White pottery from three sites of the Chalcolithic period in Cyprus-Lemba- Lakkous, Kissonerga-Mosphilia, and Erimi-Pamboula-are compared and con- trasted. The analysis is confined to three major morphological types of the Middle Chalcolithic period: the flask, the spouted bowl, and the hemibowl. Comparative results suggest that stylistic links between Mosphilia and Erimi are stronger than between either site and Lemba. This evidence contradicts standard explanations of distance as the most criticalfactor in intersite interaction and encourages archaeolo- gists to seek other explanations for the phenomenon during the Chalcolithic period. INTRODUCTION ecent approaches in anthropology and ar- chaeology have sought to use pottery evi- dence not only to measure diachronic change, but also to document and interpret spatial variability (Rice 1987: 249-52). The studies have generated new methods of stylistic analysis based on criteria that are more objective than those of the past because they have been more carefully defined. They normally address questions of stylistic varia- tion at one or more of the following levels: the technical level, concerned with the tools and ma- terials used as well as with the techniques employed in the execution of painted design; the structural level, modeled on linguistic paradigms and involv- ing analysis of painted designs into their smallest components ("elements") and the discovery of rules ("syntax") according to which elements combine to form larger structural units; and the symbolic level, attempting to elucidate the ways in which painted designs are used to signify and transmit cultural meaning. Consideration of the analyses conducted to date on Chalcolithic pottery in Cyprus, and in particular on the principal patterned ware of the period, Red- on-White (RW), shows that little work has been carried out at any of the levels just outlined (see Baird, in press b; Peltenburg 1982; Bolger 1988a: 35-72). At the symbolic level, it is unlikely that we will ever be in a position to do so. The linear character of the style and the fragmentary nature of the evidence make interpretation at that abstract level difficult if not impossible to achieve. Technically, little knowledge of the composition of RW paint is available, including such fundamen- tal distinctions as whether what we call "paint" should sometimes be more properly termed "slip" (that is, a clay solution rather than a mineral pig- ment such as hematite mixed with a binding agent). Macroscopic examination favors the latter, but more objective, scientific criteria are needed. X-ray diffraction analysis of painted sherds from Kissonerga-Mosphilia, currently underway at Glasgow University, may serve as an important first step in this direction. A second area of investi- gation that could enhance our understanding of RW technique would be experimentation with na- tive plant types to distinguish the types of brushes used to apply the painted motifs; and with stone, bone, and pottery tools to understand burnishing techniques. At present, however, our technical knowledge of decorative processes such as painting and burnishing is quite limited. During the Middle Chalcolithic (ca. 3500-3000 B.c.), which may be regarded as the floruit of the RW style, brush strokes on RW vessels tend to be narrow and closely-spaced, prompting the label "Close Line Style" to characterize the painted de- signs of that phase of the pre-Bronze Age sequence (Peltenburg 1982). During earlier phases (Late Neo- lithic and, to a lesser degree, Early Chalcolithic) 81</page><page sequence="2">82 DIANE L. BOLGER BASOR 282/283 the style is distinguished by thicker and more loosely-knit motifs; consequently, it has been re- ferred to as the "Broad Line Style" (Peltenburg 1982). Recognition of the gradual transition of RW from Broad Line to Close Line composition currently serves as the only guide to the differentia- tion of stages in the evolution of the painted style. It has proved useful in the field for the relative dating of sherd deposits which, due to their frag- mentary state, provide stylistic evidence primarily at the design-element level. It is perhaps a less useful analytical tool in cases of larger, well- preserved fragments or whole vessels, where it is possible to assess not only individual motifs, but their configurations relative to shape of the vessel and to the structural fields comprising the interior and exterior surfaces. Dikaios included in his Erimi report a general commentary on the structure of design of RW pottery there, but the limited scope of the sounding and a lack of comparative material from around the island prevented him from de- veloping those ideas in greater depth (Dikaios 1936: 31). Nevertheless, his careful and methodical re- cording of the finds permits comparison of his results with evidence from more recently excavated sites. This article will consider some of the struc- tural aspects of Middle Chalcolithic RW. First, however, it will be useful to establish some of the primary technical and structural aspects of the earlier phases of the painted style, beginning with the origins of RW ware during the Late Neolithic period. THE EARLIEST RW: LATE NEOLITHIC PERIOD Not long after painted pottery first appeared in Cyprus, it was accompanied by Combed Ware (Cb), a monochrome pottery type with reserve decoration (most often, sets of curvilinear bands) produced by scraping the painted surface with one or more of a variety of single or multiple-pronged tools. Accord- ing to Dikaios, the combed style provided the initial impetus for emergence of the painted style: by reversing positive and negative elements, the pot- tery created a new technique that in Dikaios' words "freed him from the monotony of the combed style" (Dikaios 1961: 179). Although evidence from more recent excavations has demonstrated that Combed Ware was not antecedent to early RW, there is no doubt of the close relationship between the two during the Late Neolithic period. Their association can be readily observed on Painted-and-Combed (PCb) vessels (fig. 1.6-7), on which positive bands or panels have been combed with multiple-pronged tools; on "bilingual" bowls from Sotira and else- where which display combed or painted-and- combed interiors and RW exteriors (fig. 1.5); and on bowls from Ayios Epiktitos-Vrysi in the north, decorated with both combed wavy bands and posi- tive ripple patterns (fig. 1.8; see Peltenburg 1975: 17-45). In the south, the influence of the mono- chrome tradition is attested by the restricted range of RW motifs (straight bands, zigzag bands, rings, and curvilinear bands only). On open vessels such as shallow bowls, those elements are arranged in patterns that appear to be closely related to the reserve designs of some Combed Ware vessels (fig. 1.3-4; cf. fig. 1.1 and Dikaios 1961: pl. 59). Closed vessels in RW, however, contain decorative elements that occasionally diverge from their re- serve counterparts, suggesting that vessel mor- phology played a significant role in the early development of RW design. Several globular and ovoid jugs, for example, have design fields divided vertically or horizontally (fig. 1.1-2). Static and dynamic composition are both attested, and in both cases symmetry is an important compositional fea- ture, although its potential visual impact is miti- gated by uneven line thicknesses and irregular spacing of repeated elements. In the north of the island, vivid and robust de- signs are characteristic of the painted style. At sites such as Vrysi (fig. 1.9-10), the painted pottery tradi- tion seems to have been more popular than it was in the south; moreover, there is ample evidence of diachronic change (Peltenburg 1982: 18-36). Dur- ing the early phase at Vrysi, sets of wavy bands in ripple patterns predominate, as do sets of open circles or rings; motifs are carelessly executed. Dur- ing the middle phase, linear motifs such as chevrons become popular, as do dot borders and lattice patterns used as filler motifs. Groups of wavy bands continue to be popular and persist into the late phase. At the end of that phase, however, radical changes occur. Thinner-lined lattice motifs first appear, together with reserve bars or "slits" (fig. 1.9). New shapes, such as the platter and the holemouth jar, indicate that changes in the ceramic repertoire were far-reaching. In terms of composi- tion, the most significant development of Late Phase ceramics is the division of the design field into small, compartmentalized units (Peltenburg 1982: 32). Evidence for the ultimate phase, limited</page><page sequence="3">1991 EVOLUTION OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PAINTED STYLE 83 3. 4. 17. 9. Fig. 1. Pottery of the Late Neolithic period: Sotira-Teppes (1-4); Kalavasos-Tenta (5-7); Ayios Epiktitos-Vrysi (8-10). though it is, suggests a new stage of the painted style marked by a reduction in the number of design elements; greater complexity of design composi- tion; new tools and techniques to achieve more gracile, closely-spaced linear motifs; and the appli- cation of the latter to a new range of morphological types. Many of the new features are paralleled elsewhere on the island in contexts datable to the Early Chalcolithic period. THE EMERGENCE OF AN ISLAND-WIDE STYLE: EARLY CHALCOLITHIC RW Perhaps the closest links with Vrysi can be ob- served at Kalavasos-Ayious on the south coast (fig. 2.1-3). Kromholz' preliminary study of the ce- ramics (1981: 17-53) and Baird's final report on RW at the site (Baird in press a) point to similarities between RW pottery from Ayious (especially Phase 1A) and sites of the Late Neolithic period. Propor- tions of RW during that phase, as well as the intricacy of painted compositions, closely replicate patterns recorded at middle-phase Vrysi and the earlier part of Vrysi late phase. During Phase 1B at Ayious, RW diminishes. Compositions are linear and more subdued, and there is a tendency to leave large portions of the vessel surface unpainted. That is particularly apparent on bowls with plain or rim band exteriors and interior patterning comprised of simple rectilinear elements. During Phase 2, many 1B characteristics, such as the platter shape and the spaciousness of design composition, con- tinue. There are also innovations, such as the incorporation of curvilinear elements and the first appearance of thin-lined lattice motifs. The latter are applied with a multiple brush and occur most</page><page sequence="4">84 DIANE L. BOLGER BASOR 282/283 3. /1. 7 . I 6 9 811 / 9. 10 t. I/ Fig. 2. Red-on-White pottery of the Early Chalcolithic period: Kalavasos-Ayious (1-3); Maa-Palaeokastro (4-6); Kissonerga-Mosphilia (7-11). frequently on interiors of open vessels. On closed shapes, painted designs adhere more faithfully to tradition, consisting almost entirely of reserve bands as in Ayious 1. RW from the end of the late phase at Vrysi bears close similarities to that of Ayious 1B and 2. Morphological features such as the diagnostic plat- ter shape-not a Neolithic type-and decorative features such as thin-lined multibrush lattice tech- niques suggest that the transition from Neolithic to Chalcolithic was effected during the final phase of occupation. The emergence of a positive painted style at Ayious and Vrysi in which lattice motifs played a central role demonstrates the increasing independence of the Early Chalcolithic painted style from previous decorative canons. At Ayious it is perhaps indicative of the influence of the north in those developments; at the very least, it suggests</page><page sequence="5">1991 EVOLUTION OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PAINTED STYLE 85 greater degrees of contact and communication be- tween northern and southern sectors than had pre- viously been the case. Investigations by the Lemba Archaeological Proj- ect at sites in the Ktima Lowlands north of Paphos are contributing a great deal to current understand- ing of Early Chalcolithic pottery styles in the west of Cyprus. Although not all of the excavations have been completed, a clear picture is beginning to emerge. A small scale excavation at Maa- Paleokastro, undertaken in 1986 by G. Thomas under the auspices of the Cyprus Department of Antiquities (V. Karageorghis director), yielded pot- tery that on morphological grounds appears to belong to an early stage of the Early Chalcolithic (fig. 2.4-6; Thomas 1988; Bolger 1988b). In par- ticular, a bridge-spouted hemibowl is strongly remi- niscent of Late Neolithic types; and platters with straight sides and flaring rims are common. Despite the small sample size and the severely abraded surfaces of the sherds, several features evince links with Ayious. The pieces include platters whose exteriors were monochrome or unpainted and whose interiors were decorated with thick, broadly- spaced bands (fig. 2.5); and pointed-based flasks with reserve slit and window motifs (fig. 2.4, 6). The same elements recur at other Early Chalcolithic contexts in the west, such as Kissonerga-Mosphilia Period 1, where flasks with reserve rectilinear mo- tifs and platters with lattice or plain banded in- teriors occur (fig. 2.7-10); and at Kissonerga- Mylouthkia, where RW sherdage, though rare, ex- hibits a similarly restricted range of motifs and shapes (see Bolger 1989; Peltenburg 1982: 85-87). Period I at Lemba-Lakkous probably dates to Early Chalcolithic as well. There RW is extremely rare, accounting for little more than 1.5 per cent of the total sherdage (Stewart 1985: 65). In Area I, rim bands, lattice motifs, and parallel lines are the only elements recorded. In Area II, zigzag bands and fringed or dotted bands also occur; those elements are recorded elsewhere in Middle Chal- colithic contexts, supporting the excavator's sup- position that Period I in Area II is chronologically later than Period 1 in Area I (Peltenburg 1985: 316). The evidence from the west still remains to be assessed in greater detail. However, on present analysis, Early Chalcolithic RW in the region corre- sponds closely with its counterparts elsewhere on the island. Pottery types at Chalcolithic Maa indi- cate that the site appears to be roughly contem- porary with Ayious Phase I and Vrysi Late; Mosphilia 1 and Mylouthkia with Ayious 2 and the latest part of Late Phase Vrysi; and Lemba Period 1 (Area I) overlapping in part with Ayious 2 and directly anticipating the earliest levels at Erimi (see Baird, in press a; Bolger 1988b). The close connections at all of the above sites with regard to decorative elements and their structural associa- tions argue in favor of a high level of intersite contact during the period and the emergence of an island-wide style characterized by new morphologi- cal types (platters and flasks); close association between closed shapes, notably the flask, and re- serve design elements such as slits and windows; high frequency of platter and other open shapes with plain slipped or monochrome exteriors and simply-patterned interiors; and introduction of a positive style comprised of closely spaced, thin- lined motifs executed with a multiple brush. Few of those characteristics persist into the succeeding, Middle Chalcolithic period. FROM UNIFORMITY TO COMPLEXITY: MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC RW The results of recent excavations, together with evidence from Erimi and a number of other sites investigated earlier in the century, demonstrate in- creased levels of prosperity, stability, and social complexity during the second half of the fourth millennium (see Peltenburg 1982; Peltenburg, in press). In ceramic terms, the developments are marked by a greater diversity of morphological types, including new shapes such as deep bowls with spouts or lugs, a variety of hemibowls with flanged or flattened bases, and large-scale storage jars-the first pithoi in Cyprus. The platter, diag- nostic of the Early Chalcolithic period, declines in popularity, while the flask becomes more popular. Novel shapes, such as a spouted flask from the cemetery at Souskiou (Maier and Karageorghis 1984: fig. 2) and an anthropomorphic tumbler from Mosphilia (Peltenburg 1988: fig. 1, lower right) suggest the occasional manufacture of special ves- sels for ceremonial purposes; both signify impor- tant developments in the relationship between society and the supernatural at that time. Painted decoration likewise undergoes great trans- formations. The reserve style, so popular during the Early Chalcolithic period, becomes extremely rare; positive designs are the order of the day. On open vessels, motifs occur on exterior surfaces with much greater frequency. Moreover, painted designs</page><page sequence="6">86 DIANE L. BOLGER BASOR 282/283 Fig. 3.

Comparison of those elements indicates many common examples, a phenomenon that is often interpreted as a sign of strong intersite communication. However, similari- ties in occurrence and frequency of design elements cannot by themselves be used as proof of stylistic uniformity. To infer similarities in style, researchers must also consider the structure of design elements. Several ethnographic studies have demonstrated the relative ease with which individual elements in pottery styles are exchanged locally and interregion- ally (Rice 1987: 252-54; Shepard 1980: 264-67; Hole 1984: 326-47; Plog 1983: 125-42).

BOLGER BASOR 282/283 structures, on the other hand, are much less prone to casual exchange since they are more complex and difficult to comprehend. Consequently, they serve as more accurate indicators of the character- istic styles of ceramic assemblages and provide a firmer basis for intersite comparison. To compare design structures of Middle Chalco- lithic RW assemblages, one must begin by con- sidering vessel morphology, since "design structure" is defined as the patterns of motif occurrence on particular areas of the vessel surface. Those zones, or "fields" of decoration, can be isolated by dividing the vessel into its constituent structural components (rim, body, base, etc.). Design fields for three com- mon Middle Chalcolithic types-hemibowl, deep bowl, and spouted bowl-will be considered in this article. Each shape has four fields, with the hemibowl and deep bowl divisible into exterior rim, exterior body, exterior base, and interior; the spouted bowl is divisible into exterior rim, exterior body, exterior base, and spout. Evidence from Erimi, Lemba, and Mosphilia will be utilized, since those settlement sites have yielded significant numbers of whole vessels. Admit- tedly, the number is not great, and sherdage from the sites suggests that RW design was more varied than the whole vessels alone appear to indicate. For present purposes, however, the disadvantage of a smaller body of comparative material is out- weighed by the opportunity to isolate several key aspects of the Middle Chalcolithic painted style on the basis of complete rather than fragmentary evidence. Shape 1: Hemibowl (figs. 3.1-3; 4.4; 5.1) Nine examples are included in the present analy- sis-two from Erimi, three from Lemba, and four from Mosphilia. The vessels and their associated motifs are listed in Table 1 according to site and decorative field. Field 1-a, for example, stands for the exterior rim area of vessel "a" (Erimi no. 441); Field 2-a, the exterior body of no. 441; Field 3-a, the exterior body just above the base of no. 441; and Field 4-a, the interior of no. 441. Designs are registered according to field, with "blank" signify- ing a slipped, unpainted surface; "monochrome" signifies a red, unpatterned surface. The informa- tion provided in Table 1 has been synthesized into a more usable form in Table 2. Structural elements on hemibowls at the sites reveal close associations between those from Lemba TABLE 2.

All of the examples contained rim bands in Field 1 and base bands in Field 3. More- over, comparable frequencies of structural elements occurred in Field 2 (specifically, solid rectangles over horizontal lugs) and Field 4 (internal rim bands). In contrast, Erimi hemibowls did not con- tain structural elements in any of their four fields. The link between Lemba and Mosphilia is further evidenced by a comparison of design element loca- tion. Data on design elements from Fields 2 and 4 (Table 2) indicate that all Erimi hemibowls have painted designs on their exteriors; at Lemba only one such example was recorded and at Mosphilia, none. By the same token, there was no example at Erimi of a hemibowl with interior decoration, while at Lemba and Mosphilia hemibowls often con- tained painted patterns on their interiors. A comparison of motif types on hemibowls fails to demonstrate close associations among any of those sites. A bowl from Lemba (fig. 3.1) with radiating bands on its interior is reminiscent of a bowl from Mosphilia (fig. 5.1), the latter containing lattice rather than monochrome spirals. Otherwise, however, Lemba hemibowls have blank interiors,</page><page sequence="9">1991 EVOLUTION OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PAINTED STYLE 89 TABLE 3.

Shape 2: Deep Bowl (figs. 3.4-5; 4.1-3, 5; 5.3) The process used to analyze hemibowls was next applied to deep bowls. Twelve were considered-- four each from Erimi, Lemba, and Mosphilia. Painted motifs on those vessels have been registered by site and field (Table 3). Data concerning the frequency and occurrence of design and structural elements are summarized in Table 4. With regard to the structure of design on deep bowls, there are correspondences among all three sites. Most of the examples considered in this article have rim bands and base bands on their exteriors. There were no structural elements in Field 2 at any site, and only one vessel contained a structural element in Field 4, a rim band on a bowl from Lemba (fig. 3.3). Design element percentages reveal a different pattern, however. Significant is the high frequency rate of design elements in Field 2 at Erimi and Mosphilia, and the complete lack of Field 2 designs on Lemba examples. At Lemba, Field 2 is consistently left blank, again evidence for a plain or "minimalist" style already observed on hemibowls from the site. Comparison of design elements at Erimi and Mosphilia indicates that connections between them were not as close as the evidence of structural elements suggests. Deep bowls at Erimi favor wavy strokes or diagonal bands as basic motifs, whereas at Mosphilia lattice motifs (lattice-filled checks, lattice zigzag bands, etc.) predominate. At both sites, static and dynamic compositions occur.</page><page sequence="10">90 DIANE L. BOLGER BASOR 282/283 TABLE 4.

Shape 3: Spouted Bowls (figs. 3.6-7; 4.6-7; 5.2) Seven examples of this type were considered, two each from Lemba and Erimi, and three from Mosphilia. Motifs associated with the vessels are listed by site on a field-by-field basis (Table 5). Table 6 lists percentages of structural elements and design elements and specifies design element types. Structural elements appear to have been very popular on spouted bowls at Lemba: both examples have rim bands, base bands, and rectangular painted panels in Field 2 where the spout is at- tached. At Erimi and Mosphilia, on the other hand, structural elements do not occur in Field 2 and only about 50 percent of the time in Fields 1 and 3. Design element percentages corroborate that pic- ture. At Lemba, design elements fail to occur in Field 2; the latter is simply left blank. At Erimi, however, all spouted bowls have design elements in Field 2. The best preserved example (fig. 4.7) com- bines a horizontal band joined to a solid tapered band, the latter projecting diagonally toward the base. This combination of static and dynamic ele- ments appears on deep bowls at Erimi as well (see fig. 4). At Mosphilia, two out of three spouted bowls display design elements in Field 2, but com- positions are far more dynamic than those at Erimi (e.g., fig. 5.2). Once again, lattice motifs dominate, this time with zigzag lattice bands and complex lattice-filled rectangles serving as the primary de- sign elements. CONCLUSIONS In attempting to distill basic patterns from the variety of motif occurrences and design structures, it should be stressed that the present results are by no means conclusive and should ultimately be tested and expanded by incorporating analyses of relevant sherd material. Nevertheless, a number of preliminary inferences can be made on the basis of the group of RW vessels considered here. Painted decoration on RW bowls at Lemba was composed primarily of structural elements; design elements were rare by comparison. Rim bands, base bands, and solid panels reinforcing other structural features of the vessel were the main elements used. The evidence suggests a distinctive painted tradition at Lemba in which large portions of the vessel surface were left unpainted-a bold, "minimalist" style that has not been documented elsewhere with the same degree of force. This structure-oriented style can be observed to a lesser degree on hemibowls at nearby Mosphilia, where structural elements are regularly joined by dynamic design compositions based on lattice motifs. The occurrence of painted decoration on hemibowl interiors, occasionally at Lemba and frequently at Mosphilia, may signify the persistence into the Middle Chalcolithic period of earlier painted traditions.3 Stylistic links between Erimi and Mosphilia ap- pear to be stronger than between Lemba and either of those sites. Apart from the differential placement of design elements on hemibowls (at Erimi they occurred most frequently in Field 2 and at Mos- philia in Field 4), RW vessels share many design- structure traits. Most noteworthy are the high frequencies of design elements on body exteriors (Field 2) of deep bowls and spouted bowls. Field 2 on corresponding examples at Lemba was left blank.

The similarities of Erimi and Mosphilia RW do not appear to extend to the level of motif occur- rence and design configuration, however. At Mos- philia the popularity of the lattice motif is attested both by the present corpus of vessels and by statis- tics from the general sherdage. Lattice bands in spiral arrangements on hemibowl interiors, in di- agonal zigzag arrangements on spouted bowls, and as filler motifs in rectangles projecting alternately from rim and base on deep bowls and spouted bowls, are typical examples of a bold, dynamic style peculiar to the site. Static compositions do occur at Mosphilia, but not nearly as often as they do at Erimi. Moreover, Erimi RW sometimes com- bines static and dynamic elements on a single vessel (figs. 4.5, 4.7, for example), a phenomenon not observed at Mosphilia. Purely dynamic composi- tions do occur at Erimi (fig. 4.2-3), but the thinness of brushstrokes and the tendency toward open com- positions fail to achieve the often striking effects of their Mosphilia counterparts. Unlike Mosphilia with its ubiquitous lattice designs, no single motif type dominates RW composition at Erimi. The TABLE 6.

BOLGER BASOR 282/283 recurrence of short wavy-line motifs on deep bowls (fig. 4.1, 4.5) may indicate the popularity of that element in certain contexts, but in general the evi- dence points to a far greater degree of eclecticism in the choice of design elements. The differences in the painted style at Erimi and Mosphilia outweigh their similarities. On this basis, the island-wide uniformity of RW during the Early Chalcolithic does not appear to continue to the same degree during the Middle Chalcolithic. Nor does there appear to be a return to the type of regional variation in style noted for RW designs of the Late Neolithic period; rather, the evidence sug- gests the advent of localized centers of stylistic production, perhaps the result of increased levels of craft specialization. Other classes of evidence point to accelerated growth and affluence during the second half of the fourth millennium, and it is at that time that the painted style reaches its apex, in terms of both popularity and complexity. One wonders, then, what developments occurred to ac- count for the sudden decline of the painted style during the Late Chalcolithic period, when RW all but disappeared and the long-standing tradition of painted pottery was supplanted by a monochrome tradition that persisted until the beginning of the Early Cypriot Bronze Age. NOTES 'Analysis of RW design on sherdage from Kissonerga- Mosphilia is currently being undertaken by L. Maguire. 2The published sherdage from Lemba appears to sup- port this picture; see Peltenburg 1985: figs. 59-61 for published examples. 3Further analysis of Early Chalcolithic RW is needed from sites in the west, however, before its relationship to Middle Chalcolithic RW can be properly assessed; for preliminary analyses, see Peltenburg 1982; Bolger 1988b; 1989.
