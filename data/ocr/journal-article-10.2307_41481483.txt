<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURE AND MEANING OF HERRERA'S PUERTA DEL CIELO KENNETH KRABBENHOFT Abraham Cohen de Herrera is something of an anomaly in the history of cabala. Like so many other Marranos in the early seventeenth century, he was attracted to Amsterdam, where he became an honored member of the burgeoning Sephardic community.1 The extent of his religious upbringing is not known, but he must have had some training in Hebrew as a young man, or else he would scarcely have been able to study cabala, as he claimed to have done, with Isaac Luria's self-proclaimed disciple Israel Sarug at Ragusa, probably in the early 1590s. And yet in his major work, Puerta del cielo , he casts the basic issues of cabala in a mold that takes in far more than the doctrines of the medieval masters and the Safed school of the sixteenth century, including the remarkable Ari: he embraces the entire history of Platonic theology from the pagan authorities Pythagoras and Plato, Plotinus and Proclus, to the Christian Pseudo-Dionysius, scholasticism and the Spanish theologians Francisco Suárez and Domingo Báñez. Furthermore, he wrote in Spanish, and while this, along with Portuguese, was the language of everyday communication and the secular arts in the Sephardic community, the languages of cabala were then biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, as they always had been. That Herrera was himself sensitive to his position is indicated by the provision in his will for Puerta del cielo and his other cabalistic work, Casa de la divinidad , to be translated into Hebrew.2 This task fell to the famous proselytizer Isaac Aboab. But Aboab's work 1 The earliest documents mentioning Herrera are a series of letters exchanged by Moulay Achmed el-Mansour, Sultan of Morocco, and Queen Elizabeth of England regarding Herrera's release from captivity following the Earl of Essex's famous 1596 raid on Cadiz. Herrera, who went by the name Alonso Núñez de Herrera at the time, was apparently the Sultan's commercial agent in the Spanish city. See Sources inédites de l'histoire du Maroc, Serie 1, Archives et Bibliothèques d'Angleterre, Vol. 2, pp. 108 and 139-40. Herrera's name first appears, in its Hebrew form, in the records of the Neveh Shalom congregation in 1619. "From this time until his death in 1635," writes Ralph Melnick, "he is found annually in the records of the congregation, and in a number of other documents." From Polemics to Apologetics (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1981), p. 38. 2 Christian Wolf, in his Bibliotheca Hebraea (Hamburg, 1715-33), mentions a third work by Herrera entitled Epítome y compendio de la lógica о diatètica. The most recent reference that I have been able to find is in Francisco Inocêncio da Silva's revised Dicionário Bibliográfico Português (Lisbon, 1928), where the Epitome is said to be listed in the catalogue of the Henriques de Castro library. The book, considered an only copy, was "auctioned in Amsterdam in the spring of 1899." It seems to have disappeared. The manuscript of Puerta del cielo cited in this article is that belonging to the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in the Hague. Dr. Joël Cahen was most helpful in securing a microfilm of this manuscript. The only extant manuscript of Casa de la divinidad (Ms. Var. 106) belongs to the Etz Haim Seminary in Amsterdam, currently on loan to the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem. 1</page><page sequence="2">introduces another, more serious anomaly. On the basis of his Hebrew versions and a subsequent Latin translation of the Hebrew, Herrera became simultaneously one of the best-known and most poorly understood representatives of Lurianic cabala in the eyes of Christian Europe. Until the pioneering work of Gershom Scholem he was also unjustly reviled by most Jewish commentators, whether they were generally hostile to cabala like Heinrich Grätz or generally favorable like Adolphe Franck. The reason for this is that Aboab's Hebrew versions, Sha'ar ha-Shamayim and Beit Elohim , are by all accounts less translations than radical interpretations of Puerta del cielo and Casa de la divinidad. Aboab so altered these texts that the result bears but a distant resemblance to the original. Meijer Roest, in 1868, and Meyer Kayserling, in 1890, were the first to notice this.3 Kayserling remarks, „A work entitled , Puerta del cielo' exists in manuscript, but it is so different from the Hebrew translation that one could consider it a separate work."4 In his introduction to Das Buch Sha'ar ha-Shamayim oder Pforte des Himmels , Gershom Scholem pinpoints the differences between the two. He summarizes his findings as follows: "While the original begins with a concise explanation of cabalistic concepts and symbols and does not present a philosophical discussion that presumes familiarity with cabalistic terminology until the third book, Aboab's version has a different structure: it starts out with detailed discussions of a philosophical nature, thus giving the book a different appearance."5 This weighting of the presentation toward philosophy pushes Herrera's emphasis on the essential harmony of cabala and Platonism to the side, Scholem goes on to say, crowding the real cabalistic doctrine into the later books. A comparison of the eight books of Sha'ar ha-Shamayim with the ten books of Puerta del cielo shows very clearly that Aboab paid insufficient attention to the major concerns of Herrera's cabala: namely, the logical and metaphysical implications of the emanation of Adam Kadmon and the use of "theologia negativa," to use Nicholas of Cusa's term, to describe the transcendent Deity. To begin with, Aboab omitted the first two books of Puerta del cielo altogether - nearly a third of the manuscript text. The contents of the Hebrew version, in Scholem's summary, are as follows: I. On the First Cause and the dependence of all beings on it. II. Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, as first emanated being. III. The First Cause, causation and creation. IV. On the emanation of the sefirot and the creation of the three worlds. V. Aspects of cabaUstic ontology and psychology. VI. Further details of the same. 3 Meijer Roest, Catalog der reichhaltigen Sammlungen Hebräischer und Jüdischer Bücher, Handschriften etc. (Amsterdam, 1868), p. 353.

Luria's doctrine of the breaking of the vessels and the parzufim or configurations of the sefirot. The ten books of Puerta del cielo can be summarized thus: I. On the transcendence of Ein-Sof the First Cause. The sefirot: names, properties and interrelationships. II. Zimzum and the doctrine of the parzufim. III. Negative theology: the First Cause as above being. IV. Proofs of the necessity of a first emanated being. V. Ein-Sof s infinity, free will and eternity. The creation of the three worlds below azilut. VI. On the hierarchy of being. VII. On zimzum and the azilut. VIII. Azilut and the restoration of the configurations of the sefirot (tikkun ha-parzufim). IX. Further details of the same. X. Clarificaton of points of Lurianic doctrine glossed in Book II. The restoration of the lights and devekut or mystical union. In addition, Aboab's practice of incorrectly translating scholastic terminology further distorted Herrera's text. If Puerta del cielo and Casa de la divinidad had remained in these Hebrew versions alone, however, they probably would have receded into the background of cabalistic studies. But the fact that Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, the Protestant theologian and proponent of Christian cabala, gave Sha'ar ha-Shamayim and Beit Elohim prominence in his Latin anthology of cabalistic texts ( Kabbala Denudata , Sulzbach, 1677-84) catapulted Herrera - or rather Aboab's version of Herrera - into general reknown.6 Although in Scholem's opinion the quality of the Latin translation is "remarkably good, considering the difficulty of Aboab's Hebrew style," von Rosenroth greatly reduced Aboab's text, giving it a new structure and sequence and thus removing the reader's perception of Herrera yet another degree. If Sha'ar ha-Shamayim already reads like a separate work, Porta Coelorum on first examination bears no realtionship at all to the original. It is 55 pages long, for instance, when the Hague manuscript of Puerta del cielo consists of 162 folios. Although he retained Aboab's division into eight books, which he calls Disser- tations, von Rosenroth greatly shortened many of them, summarizing or omitting others altogether. The portions of the Hebrew text suppressed from the Latin are, in Scholem's analysis, from Dissertation III, chapters 2-5 and 10-12 IV, chapters 4-14 (virtually the entire book) V, chapters 5 and 6 (chapter 13 of the Spanish text is already missing from the Hebrew) VI, chapters 1-6 (briefly summarized) and 17 VIII, chapters 1-5, 7 and 8, and 10-12. 7 Most seriously prejudiced by these omissions are precisely the key points of Lurianic 6 The other principal works that von Rosenroth drew on are Moses Cordovero's Pardes Rimmonim, frequently cited in Puerta del cielo , and Joseph Gikatilla's Shďarei Orah, which is also cited by Herrera. 7 Scholem, op. cit., p. 40. 3</page><page sequence="4">doctrine that Herrera was most anxious to reconcile with Platonic tradition. When these are not omitted, they are dealt with superficially. The end result is that Porta Coelorum is even more heavily weighted toward the philosophical aspects of Herrera's thought than is Sha'ar ha-Shamayim and even less representative of Herrera's scope and complexity. What follows is a first step toward bringing Herrera's own complex presentation, as he wrote it, to the public eye, by examining the structure of Puerta del cielo? Taking cabalistic numerology (gematria) as a starting point, these pages relate the structural organization of this work to specific tenets of cabala. Casa de la divinidad is cited where appropriate: it does not lend itself to structural analysis, unfortunately, because the text is incomplete, breaking off in mid-sentence in Chapter 6 of Book V. It is also of secondary interest in that as a traditional treatise on angels it does not undertake the ambitious reconciliation of cabala with non- Jewish Platonism. The notion that things are numbers is as integral to cabala as the notion that things are letters. To begin with, letters and numbers are identical: К is one, the first number, as well as the letter alef, first in the alphabet. Every Hebrew word therefore "adds up" to a numerical value which can be calculated in a variety of ways. As manifestations of what Herrera in scholastic terminology calls Ein-Sofs infinite active potency, letters and numbers do not merely "stand for" the created entities that populate the intelligible worlds: they very concretely are those things. Historically, this notion first appears in the West in the teachings of the Pythagoreans, a pre-Socratic religious sect which left no writings of its own. The word gematria may in fact come from the Greek word geometria (уесо^етрьа). Whatever its origin, gematria was early wed to the allegorical interpretation of scripture: from the earliest texts of cabala, gematria has been a her- meneutical tool. The Merkabah mystics found that by studying the numerical values of words taken from the liturgy, they could more reaily discern the mystical intentions (kavannot) concealed within them.9 Gematria was later incorporated into the four-fold exegetical method adopted by Judaism from the Church Fathers (notably Origen and Clement of Alexandria), who for their part had been inspired by Philo and the rabbinical tradition of the first centuries A.D. By the Golden Age of Spanish cabala it had been integrated into the doctrine of the sefirot. Although it plays a relatively minor role in the Zohar , gematria was featured by Gikatilla in his Ginnat Egoz (1274), the title of which is itself an acrostic of the terms gematria, notarikon (acrostics) and temurah (permutation).10 In the sixteenth century, Moses Cordovero did not stress numerology, making but a passing reference to it at the end of Pardes Rimmonim, but Isaac Luria and his followers fully integrated the complex techniques of gematria into the metaphorical systems of the new cabala created in the wake of the Spanish expulsion. Scholem s admirable editorial control over the German translation of Porta Coelorum is a step in this direction. He compared the German to both the Latin and the Hebrew versions, correcting those of von Rosenroth s errors which, in his words, "obscured Herrera's argument or rendered it unintelligible" (op. cit., p. 65). He also monitored von Rosenroth's rather free use of scholastic terminology. Nevertheless, Porta Coelorum was translated not from Herrera's text but from Aboab's: the true "argument" can only properly be understood from the Spanish original. Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (New York. 1978Ì d 32 10 ibid., p. 409. 4</page><page sequence="5">As is usually the case with as richly inventive a group of writers as those customarily classified as Lurianic, there were differences of approach and emphasis.100 Herrera follows his teacher Sarug in placing importance on the meaning of numerology as an expression of Ein-Sof s creative power. The primordial form that this power takes is the Ineffable Name or Tetragrammaton ( П1ГР) and gematria is the primary means of unlocking the ultimate meaning contained within that name. This is accomplished by the procedure of "filling" (millui): the names of the letters that make up the Tetragrammaton are spelled out and then '"filled" with the letters yod and alef in different combinations, then the numerical values of the resulting configurations are calculated. Herrera presents this in Book II, Chapter 4 of Puerta del cielo : The Ineffable Name, which contains the primordial Adam within itself, also in- cludes a yod when it is spelled with vav and dalet, thus: *71 &gt; . From this comes the name of 5У or 72 filled with yodim: &gt; M 1*1 &gt; il 41*. This is the origin and cause, as we have already said, of the emanated sefirot. It also contains a he, which when filled with yod like this: *il makes the name of ДО or 63, espanding its four letters... into ten and filling them with yodim with the exception of vav, which incorporates an alef in this way:. Nil INI NÎ1 41 *i This is the origin of the world of beriah, the throne of glory. It also happens that the vav, filled with alef thus: 1 К 1 unfolds the Ineffable Name of hnor 45, which is filled with alefim, like this: KM INI Nil TI &gt; This is the origin of the world of yezirah, the angelical world. Lastly the final he, filled with another he like this Mil making the name of or 52 - the name filled with hehim - is the cause of the world of asiyyah, the world of creatures, I mean this lower, material world.11 Beaming forth from Ein-Sof like rays of light from the sun, being first takes the metaphorical form of the highest three sefirot; from the interaction of these three the seven remaining sefirot take shape. Specifically, from the spike or flip at the top of the letter yod (*) emanates Keter, the skull of Adam Kadmon. Hokhmah emanates from the letter yod itself and Binah from the first he of the Tetragrammaton. These two sefirot are 10a Scholem concludes that gematria figures less prominently in the works of Luria's amanuensis Hayyim Vital than in the more eclectic works of Sarug and his students, notably Menahem Azariah of Fano and Herrera.

The six so-called sefirot of the foundation (Hesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Nezah, Hod and Yesod, correspond- ing to the arms, torso, legs and sexual organ) emanate from the letter vav, which as the sixth letter of the alphabet also is the letter six. From the second he of the Tetragrammaton emanates Malkhut, the tenth sefirah representing the female sexual principle.12 These ten sefirot cannot be said to have been "created" by Ein-Sof because they are consubstantial with Ein-Sof s being and will: they are ways of speaking about God as if he were somehow describable in human terms. By their complex interaction, which is the object of the cabalist's meditation, they actually "make" the universe, and because they can be characterized by numbers - because they actually are numbers - their activities can be expressed arithmetically. Hence the name or value of 72 indicates the world of emanated being, called azilut - that is, the totality of the sefirot, the metaphorical members of Adam Kadmon's body. The number 63 means beriah, the seat of glory which is the first of the three worlds created by the interaction of the sefirot. It consists of the divine merkabah or throne of God. 45 designates the realm of the angels or purely spiritual being, called yezirah, and 52 the sublunary world of beings composed of both matter and spirit, the asiyyah, man's world. To make the connection between the number values of the Tetragrammaton and the structure of Puerta del cielo, however, one must simultaneously take an overview of the simpler numbers and plunge into the complexities of Lurianic doctrine. Given the creative role of the ten sefirot, the numbers one through ten (the decad) can rightly be expected to have individual importance as manifestations of the identity of each sefirah - like color, virtue, emotion, bodily part, etc. Considered individually, the numbers yield the rich texture of identification between arithmetic and theology, between integers and things, and Herrera's conscious effort to embody this identification at the various structural levels of his work becomes clear. Beginning, then, with the beginning: К signifies the First Cause, the unique Deity existing from all eternity and above all things while simultaneously being the First Cause of all things. The very first chapter of Book I of Puerta del cielo forcefully states this: It is necessary that there be, and consequently it is certain that there always has been and shall be, as there now is, an eternal and uncaused cause of all things that exists ab eterno and before all other things. This necessary being exists by himself and in himself and for himself and not in, for or by any other being. His very being is purest act and free of all material or passive potency. He is infinitely good and most simply one. He exists and consists in and for himself with unlimited perfection and self- sufficiency, thus exceeding all other things, having no proportion in relation to any thing or to all things considered as a whole: rather, he contains all things in himself with supreme eminence and simplicity creating, sustaining, ruling and raising all 12 Cf. Puerta del cielo I, 12: "Senalando con la punta del yod a Kether, que es no menos encubierto que alto, con la misma yod a Hochma; con la primera he a binah, y con la Vau siguiente, que significa el numero de seis, a las seis sephiroth que llaman dela fabrica, y que son hesed, gheburath, tiphereth, Nesah, Hod y yesod, y finalmente Con he postrera demuestra a malcuth la santa." Fo. 5v. 6</page><page sequence="7">things outside himself to perfection by virtue of his infinite goodness, potency and wisdom. He does not do this in order to acquire or add to himself anything that he lacks or in order to enlarge himself, as being infinitely perfect he lacks nothing and cannot lack anything, but rather to give and communicate some part of the goodness that he exuberantly is and contains to all things through his mercy and grace. Each and every thing is an image of all of his effects, and in each thing, although in some more than others, is his perfection knowable and known, as his essence cannot be reached or attained by any created intelligence. In and by each and every created thing is Ein-Sofs perfection therefore known and glorious and worthy of praise.13 From the very first Herrera sets the tone of his work: Ein-Sof is described as the Platonic-Plotinian locus idearum, as the hidden God of Hermetic tradition who exists above being and as the Aristotelian Unmoved Mover. Moreover, each of the ten books of Puerta del cielo begins with a chapter dedicated in some fashion to Ein-Sof s transcendent perfection and limitless power. Book II, Chapter 1 intones Ein-Sofs uniqueness as First Cause. Book III, Chapter 1 discusses the identity of Ein-Sofs being with his free will to create (see the discussion of 3 below). Thirteen proofs that the emanation of Adam Kadmon in no way compromises the free will and transcendence of Ein-Sof are given in Book IV, Chapter 1, and the first chapter of Book V describes eight types of infinity of which three describe Ein-Sof. VI, 1 defends the necessity of a first emanation; VII, 1 deals with how Ein-Sof can be spoken of meaningfully, that is, in affirmative and negative ways; VIII, 1 describes the sefirot by comparison with Ein-Sofs transcendence; IX, 1 speaks of the Tetragrammaton and gematria; and X, 1 introduces Luria's doctrine of the five lights which issue from and return to Ein-Sof in the eternal systole-diastole of emanation and contemplation (see the discussion of below). In addition, Book I consists of 45 chapters - 45 being one of the holy numbers yielded by the "filling" of the Tetragrammaton. The number к would seem to be fully integrated into both the substance and the structure of Puerta del cielo. This is less true of X which designates both Adam Kadmon as first emanated being (the second entity in the universe, that is, after Ein-Sof) and the duality of emanated and created being, the One and the many. There are clear correspondences between the chapter numbers and П in only three books. In Book II, Chapter 2, Herrera presents 13 Puerta del cielo 1,1: "Ab eterno y antes de las demás Cosas, es necessario que aya y por Consiguiente es Cierto que Uvo, Como también ay y avra Siempre un eterno y yncauzado Cauzador de todo, que siendo por sy y no por otro en sy y pára sy y no en otro ni para otro, es nesessario ser y por su essencia acto purissimo y libre de toda material y passiva potencia, ynfinito bien y Senzillissimo Uno que en sy y por sy, Con ynlimitada perfecion y sufficiencia, Existe y consiste y que como tal excediendo a las demás Cosas, sin tener proporcion con ninguna delias ni con todas las contiene en si con suma eminencia y senzilleza, produze, conserva, govierna y perficiona fuera de si Con infinita bondad, potencia y sabiduría, no para adquerir o augmentar algo que le falte, pues como ynfinitamente perfecto no le falta ni puede faltar nada, sino para dar y communicar a todos por merced y gracia alguna porcion de la bondad que con ynmensa exuberansia en si es y contiene, representando en todos sus effectos y en cada Uno dellos, aun que en Unos mas y en otros menos, aquella perfección que siendo en sy ynacessible y ynalcançable a todos los producidos Entendimientos, es solamente Conocible y Conosida y por Con- siguiente Celebrada y glorioza por ellos en ellos." Fo. 1. 7</page><page sequence="8">Luria's notion of zimzum or the metaphorical contraction by which Ein-Sof is understood to have reduced his infinite extension in space in order to "make room" for the universe outside himself, beginning with Adam Kadmon, the eternal and infinite being dis- tinguished from the First Cause by its "otherness" from him. Herrera writes, Contracting his infinity within himself by means of the metaphorical zimzum or contraction, Ein-Sof the limitless First Cause created finite and limited effects in finite places and times, and first he made the original and most perfect effect, which contains all others in itself.14 In other passages Herrera discusses this solution to the problem of the One and the many in overtly Plotinian terms. Plotinus writes, in Ennead 5 .4. 27, "There is in everything the Act of the essence and the Act going out from the essence: the first Act is the thing itself in its realized identity, the second Act is an inevitably following outgo from the first, an emanation distinct from the thing itself."15 Coupled with the Platonic notion that infinite goodness is infinitely giving of itself, Plotinus' equation of essence and act is used by Herrera to explain both the eternity and infinity of Adam Kamon - the "inevitable outgo" of Ein-Sof, his "realized identity" - and the fact that Ein-Sof emanated the sefirot as an act of free will which did not imply the inner duality of choosing subject and chosen act within the Godhead. The other second chapters which discuss the fundamental duality of Ein-Sof/ Adam Kadmon, a duality posited on identity, are in Book VII, which tackles certain implications of the doctrine of zimzum, and Book VIII, where the allegory of Adam Kadmon as human body is introduced after an initial chapter describing the perfections of Ein-Sof. The number A informs the structure of the third Book of Puerta del cielo. One of the most commonly used techniques of gematria - adding the members of an arithmetical progression - shows the perfection of the number three to consist in the sum of one and two, Ein-Sof and the first emanated being, the One and the many. Consequently there are three created worlds below Adam Kadmon (beriah, yezirah and asiyyah), which are analogous to the Neoplatonic worlds of the intellect (Trveujia), the soul ('|л&gt;хт|) and matter (ì3't0, to the Pseudo-Dionysius' tripartite ranking of the angels into the hierarches of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to the three ways of mystical ascent and of course ultimately to the doctrine of the Trinity. There are also three triads in Adam Kadmon. One is the differentiation between the first three sefirot and the other seven. The second is made, as Herrera specifies in Book I, Chapter 23 of Puerta del cielo , of the vertical groupings Hokhmah-Hesed-Nezah on the right hand; Keter-Tiferet-Yesod in the center; and Binah-Gevurah-Hod on the left. The third set of three groupings of three sefirot is horizontal: Keter, Hokhmah and Binah are the intellectual sefirot (ha-muskal); Hesed, Gevurah and Tiferet the psychic sefirot (sensitivas, or ha-murgash); and Nezah, Hod and Yesod form the material or natural sefirot (ha-mutba). In addition, Zoharic cabala gave the soul a three-part structure, following the tradition established by Plato in Timaeus. At 14 Puerta del cielo II 2: "Encogiendo en si Su ynfinidad por el metaphorico Zimzum o Encogimiento Produxo ensoph la ynlimitada Cauza primera finitos y limitados effectos en finitos lugares y tiempos y primeramente al primero y mas perfecto y que en sy Contiene a todos los demás."

The contemplative arrives at this state by first passing through the level of ruah of spirit, beginning with nefesh, the most spiritual state, or vital principle. Book III of Herrera's work reflects the tripartite division of Adam Kadmon, in which Malkhut, the tenth sefirah, is traditionally omitted, in that it has nine chapters. Squaring is another technique of cabalistic numerology. The perfection of the number A is that it subsumes the previous numbers of the decad, being the sum of one and three and the square of two. In Book VIII, Chapter 4 Herrera elaborates on its significance. Commenting on the name Adam ( 0 *TK), he writes Q*TK includes H one and 1 four and 0 forty... and in effect OIK or rather К is one, that is Adam and his infinite world (i.e. azilut) which with the 1 or four letters of his (i.e. Ein-Sof s) name created the four worlds of azilut, beriah, yezirah and asiyyah and imprinted on them П or forty sefirot, ten in each world, or as it is said in the prologue to the Tikkunim the majesty that is above all things enlightens the ten sefirot of the azilut and the ten of the beriah and the ten choirs and bands of angels and the circles or spheres in which the heavens extend and are based, which aren or forty. To this we might add that my teacher, Haham Rabbi Israel Sarug (peace be with him), taught that D*TK is composed of КО and T, which mean "mother" and "four", showing that Adam Kadmon is the cause of the four worlds, as has been said so many times. And I believe he is called the mother and not the father of the worlds so that no one will confuse Adam Kadmon with the First Cause, considering him rather the woman, instrument, vessel or receptacle of the First Cause which like a growth is born of the first Adam ánd is by virtue of his power the mother of all human beings.16 The creative power of the primordial emanated being is here stated in terms of the Lurianic notion of the breaking of the vessels and the restoration of the faces of God (tikkun ha-parzufim). Briefly, Luria taught that when the light of being issued from the Tetragrammaton, so great was its force that although the three sefirot ha-muskal retained the light, it shattered the sefirot of the foundation. The shards of these sefirot, called the sefirot kelim or vessels, are variously interpreted as the source of matter in the Greek sense of v't| and the origin of evil. But Luria also said that a process of restoration (tikkun) begins immediately following the shevirah or breaking of the vessels. Since the original configuration of Adam Kadmon has been destroyed, the sefirot must be reorganized: the 16 Puerta del cieloV ИМ'.ОЧК yncluye К uno, "T quatro, D quarenta... y en effecto DTK o de otra manera N es uno, es a Sabera adam y su mundo del ynfinito, que con las 1 o quatro letras de su nombre produxo los 4 mundos de la assiluth, beriah, yetsira y hassiah y ynprimio en ellos По quarenta Sephiroth, dies en cada uno o como se dize en el prologo de los tecunim el alto sobre todo ylustra a las dies Sephiroth de la assiluth, a las dies de la beriah, a los dies choros о quadrillas de los angers y a los dies Circuios о espheras de la espançion о firmamento del Cielo, que son П o quarenta, a que se deve añadir lo que me dixo mi meastro el haham Raby Ysrael Sarugo (sobre el la paz) que И*ТКе s compuesto de ПК y *1 que significa madre y quatro, en demostración que adam Kadmon es Cauza de los quatro mundos que tantas vezes sean repetido y creo que se llama madre y no padre de los mundos porque no piense alguno que es la Cauza primera, Sino su hembra, ynstrumento, vaso y receptáculo, y que como hava que procedió de Adam el hombre primero y fue con su efficacia madre de todos los vivientes humanos.

There are five of them: Attika Kadisha (the ancient holy one; el antiguo santo), Arikh Anpin (the longfaced one; el estendido de fazes), Abba (father; Padre), Imma (mother; madre) and Ze'eir Anpin (the short-faced one; el chico de fazes). Keter is associated with Arikh Anpin, Hokhmah and Binah with Abba and Imma, Ze'eir Anpin with the sefirot of the foundation, minus Malkhut, who becomes the female of Ze'eir Anpin (la hembra de Zeher anpin). The interrelationships are of course infinitely complex. What Herrera does in the passage cited above is to extend the sexual metaphor of the coupling or zivvug of Abba and Imma, Ze'eir Anpin and Malkhut, to the relationship of Adam Kadmon with Ein-Sof. The inner process of self-manifestation within the Godhead is then described as a kind of copulation of a passive, female element represented by Adam Kadmon with an aggressive, male element identified with the First Cause. It is a typically bold and inventive metaphor. Herrera's eclectic ideal and keen sense of history lead him back to the source of this theological importance of the number four, which he readily acknowledges. In Book IX, Chapter 2, he explains: The first plane figure described by three points is the triangle, thus... But four points make up the first solid body, which is the pyramid, in this manner... 4 After this, 5 or 6 points add no more to this solid body, which is perfect and complete in regard to space and the dimensions in such a way that 4 points describe all three dimensions, extensions or spaces, which are longitude, latitude and profundity - that is, length, depth and breath. And within 4 is also 10, as 4 -I- 3 -I- 2 -I- 1 ... And thus the Ineffable Name, which is one, contains within itself two in the twice-repeated he; three, in its three different letters - which are yod, he and vav; and four, in the four letters which spell it. It also contains five, in he; six, in vav; and seven in the filling of 52. Counting the tens as ones, it adds up to seven; eight in the number 26, which it also adds up to; nine, in the numbers 72, 63 and 45; and finally ten in the letters of its unfolding or complete spelling, thus: KM ÌK1 KM Г It therefore contains all numbers within itself.17 In Book IX, Chapter 4, Herrera states that the Pythagoreans swore by the number four, 17 Puerta del cielo IX, 2: "La primera figura Superficial que es el triangulo, assi es aquel espacio que es contenido de tres puntos, Siendo ynfalible verdad que dos puntos, ni dos lineas, no pueden terminar ni Constituyr ninguna Superficie ... mas quatro puntos Constituyen el primero Cuerpo, que es la Piramide en este modo . 4. Despues de lo qual 5 o 6 o mas puntos no hazen mas que Cuerpo, que es perfecto y total en las dimensiones o espacios de modo q(ue) todas las tres dimensiones, estenciones o espacios, que son la longitud, latitud y profundidad, Л luengo, el ancho y el gruesso, se Contienen entre quatro puntos, y en el 4 ay 10, assi 4:3:2: 1... De modo que el nombre ynefable que es uno Contiene el dos en la he dos vezes repetida, tres en tres diferentes letras que son yod, he y Vau, y quatro en las quatro letras de que es Compuesto; Contiene también el sinco, en la he, el seis en la vau, el Siete en el hinchimiento de 52 que contando las decenas por unidades monta Siete, el ocho en el numero de 26 que por la misma quenta lo menta, el nueve en los nombres de 72, 62 y 45 y el dies finalmente en las letras de su estencion o Soletreamiento assi: КП 1 К 1 KM *T 1 * con que yncluye en si a todos los numéros que hasta dies se estienden." Fo. 127-127v. 10</page><page sequence="11">such was its perfection (assi los Pitagóricos juravan por el; fo. 129). The passage above appears to be a paraphrase of Aristotle's account of Pythagoreanism in Metaphysics I, Chapter 5, with possible references to later chroniclers like Speusippus and Theo Smyr- naeus.18 The principle of universal analogy dictates that the number four will therefore recur in countless ways on all levels of existence. Book IX, Chapter 3 lists some of these. It is too long to translate in its entirety: the following are merely a few representative analogies: The cabalists, and in particular our master the learned Ashkenazi of Luria, speak wonders of (the correspondences between the number four and the things in the world): four are the divine sparks, ... the throne of glory has four columns or legs to which correspond the three Fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who count four if we include David... There are four princes among the angels: Michael, Gabriel, Oriel or Nuriel and Raphael, and they lead four different ranks of angels... There are four guardians of the night and four hordes of kelippot or evil spirits; four kinds of spiritual smoke in heaven - white, red, yellow and black; four rivers flow from the Garden of Delights. There are thought to be four corners to the earth, four groups of three signs in the sky, four elements in the sublunary world, four winds in the air. There are four tangible sensations, namely heat, cold, wetness and dryness, and four combination of these four qualities - dry heat, wet heat, wet cold and dry cold. There are four seasons in the year - spring, summer, autumn and winter; four humors in men - the bilious, the sanguine, the phlegmatic and the melancholic... There are four principal emotions - desire, fear, joy and pain, or love, hate, pleasure and pain; four moral virtues - wisdom, justice, moderation and strength, which reside in the four faculties of the soul, namely, the understanding, the will, the power of concupiscence and anger. There are four theological virtues - faith, hope, love or charity and filial or divine obedience...19 18 Speusippus reported that for the Pythagoreans "1 is the point, 2 the line, 3 the triangle and 4 the pyramid." Theo Smyrnaeus specified that the Pythagoreans believed that "the seed is analogous to the unit and point, growth in length to the dyad and the line, growth in breath to the triad and the plane, growth in depth to the tetrad and the solid."

Just as cabala does not obviate pagan and Christian authority, so Platonism does not obviate Aristotelianism: As the scholastics have proven, all created things have four characteristics, namely, being, existence, potency and act, and there is nothing that does not participate in the four transcendent qualities of unity, goodness, truth and being. As Job says, there are four things in a man - skin, flesh, muscles and bone. The moon has four quarters and the sea changes four times every twenty-four hours... There were four ancient empires, namely, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks and Romans. There are four primary metals - gold, silver, copper and iron. There are four Fathers buried in Hebron, four Mothers of Israel, which marched through the desert divided into four armies with four galim or standards. The fourth son of Leah was King, and he includes the Ineffable Name of four letters in his own name... Four kinds of herbs and fruit are used in the Passover celebration...20 Such is the importance of the number of letters in the Tetragrammaton. And yet the only relationship to chapter numbers is in the second Book, where Chapter 4 explains the four numerical values of 72, 63, 45 and 52. The number il is unique because it is the sum of the first even number ( U) and the first odd number (Д): "It is therefore the first and the most perfect of the compound numbers, that which contains all numbers because all are necessarily either even or odd" (Viene a ser el primero el mas perfecto de todos los compuestos números, y que en si los Contiene a todos, pues todos necessariamente son pares o ynpares; VIII, 13, fo. 118). The primordial outgo of being from Ein-Sof in the form of light is described, as we have seen, as issuing from the four letters of the Tetragrammaton; it is also phrased in terms of the number five (it could of course be described in an infinite number of ways). Citing Luria, Herrera explains how the divine light burst forth from the five orifices in the head of Adam Kadmon - synonymous with the three highest sefirot, which did not break in the shevirah - following zimzum: As our wise Luria of blessed memory teaches, Adam Kadmon performed zimzum or the contraction of light by placing in the center of his metaphorical body an intermediary piece or membrane called the diaphragm and drawing it into the 20 Puerta del cielo ibid: "En toda Criatura se yncluyen, como los escolásticos pruevan, quatro Cosas, es a Saber, essencia, existencia, virtud y operacion, y no ay Cosa que no participe de los quatro transcen- dentes, unidad, bondad, verdad y essencia; en el hombre ay, como dize lob, quatro Cosas, piel, Carne, niervo y huesso; quatro quartos tiene la luna, quatro mudanças haze la mar en un dia de 24 oras ... quatro fueron las monarchias, es a Saber assirios, Persas, griegos y Romanos; quatro son los principales metales, oro, plata, Cobre y hierro; quatro son los Padres enterrados en Hebron; quatro las madres de Ysrael, el qual marchava en el desierto ordenado en quatro exercitos con quatro Galim o estandartes; el quarto hijo de lea fue Rey y tiene en su nombre yncluso el ynefable y de quatro letras ... quatro son los generös de yerva y fruta que Se Celebran en las pasqua de los tabernáculos etc." Fo. 128v. 12</page><page sequence="13">upper part of his body, which extends from the waist or diaphragm up. This tightened and contracted the upper part of the body, and the light burst forth with great force from the openings and doors in it, which are the orifices of the head - the eyes, the ears (or) nostrils and the mouth -, issuing forth as five lights or spiritual orders, each one of which consists of ten intrinsic and ten extrinsic sefirot.21 Not only does the number five determine the number of sefirot, it also explains their inner workings. Thus there are said to be five stages in the life of Ze'eir Anpin, who like the rest of the parzufim represents Ein-Sof s "self-manifestation." Directed by the three highest sefirot, all of the sefirot join together to bring about the restoration of Adam Kadmon through the formation of the parzufim, which is described in anthropomorphic-sexual terms: "first three and then four sefirot join together, then five, six and seven, then all ten, and according to their couplings the actions and effects of the inferior sefirot vary in a thousand ways, but we also note in them the parabolical ibbur or pregnancy, yelida or birth, katnut or infancy, yenika or suckling, gadlut or maturity, mohim or brains and zivvug or coitus about which our Master speaks at such great length" (ya se ajuntan tres sephiroth y a quatro ya 5:6 y 7 ya todas dies, y según su vario a juntamiento varían en mil maneras, las actiones y effectos de los ynferiores, mas también Consideramos en ellos los parabólicos ybur o preñes, yelida o nacimiento Ketanut o niñez, yenika o alechar, godlut o Crecimento, mohim o Sesos, y Zuvogh o Copula de que tan Copiosamente trata nuestro Preceptor; VIII, 13, fo. 117v). If one sets aside the final two stages mentioned above (mohim and zivvug), there are five stages to the life-cycle of the parzuf. To them corre- spond the five levels of spiritual existence in post-Zoharic cabala, which added two levels to the original three (mentioned above). From highest to lowest, they are yehidah, hayyah, neshamah, ruah and nefesh. Herrera also works in Aristotelian notions of cause and effect, assigning various properties to the five parzufim as follows: That infinite being which (1) exceeds all else, (2) contains all, (3) creates, (4) governs and (5) perfects all by means of three types of causation, to wit (3) the efficient, (4) formal and (5) final causes, making all things through (3) Hesed or grace or (4) Din or justice or (5) Rahamin or mercy...22 In the organization of chapters in Puerta del cielo , Book II, Chapter 5 introduces the 21 Puerta del cielo VIII, 11: "Adam Kadmon, según refiere el Sapiente Loria, de bendita memoria, poniendo en la mitad de su metaphorico Cuerpo un como destajo y ynterpuesta tela, que llaman diafragma, hizo Zimzum y encogimiento de lumbre, represendola en la superior parte del Cuerpo que está de la diafragma y Cintura hazia arriba, que como apretada y detenida salio Con gran ympetu fuera por las aberturas y casi puertas que halló en lo alto, que son los poros de la Cabeça, los ojos, las orejas las ventanas de las narizes y la boca, esplicandose en sinco luzes o grados de anima de que cada uno consta de dies Sephiroth yntrinsicas y dies estrinsicas." Fo. 1 14. 22 Puerta del cielo VIII, 16: "Aquel ynfinito que 1. excede a todo, 2.

Din o justicia o por 5. Rahamim y misericordia etc." Fo. 122v. 13</page><page sequence="14">doctrine of the parzufim. They are also discussed in Book VIII, Chapter 5. Aside from this there are no obvious correlations. There are 1 stages or areas of beriah (see below, under * ), and the serafim are said to have six wings ( Casa de la divinidad , Book III, Chapter 8), but generally this number has minor significance for Herrera. In cabalistic cosmogony, it may play no role because it is neither the sum of the preceding numbers of the decad nor the square of any one of those numbers. The number T , on the other hand, generates a rich symbolism, not so much in Puerta del cielo , where Herrera so often has an eye out for analogies outside Jewish tradition, but in Casa de la divinidad, with its intricate account of the hierarchy and structure of yezirah, the angelical realm, in the Merkabah tradition. This is not the place to explain this complex symbolism which is also reflected in the grouping of the seven sefirot of the foundation. If we were to choose a representative passage, however, we would pick Chapter 7 of Book II of Casa de la divinidad, where Herrera speaks of the division of the three created worlds into seven "Mansions of Sanctity" (Palacios de Sanctidad), in each of which there are "seven grades or levels and orders of angels which the Zohar calls both Hekhalot (Man- sions) and Medurim (Dwellings" (Siete Distinctiones, Grados, Hordenanças de Angeles, que el Zohar ya llama Hechaloth o Palacios) ya Medurim (o Moradas); p. 85). Further- more, in the lower grade there are "seven dwellings of anger and darkness in which the evil spirits and damned souls reside" (otras Siete Moradas de Enconamiento y Escuridad, en que habitan los Espiritus Immundos y Animas Condennadas; ibid.). The Tikkunim say that there are seven seas, and Moses Cordovero points out that the seven sefirot of the foundation flow from Binah like seven seas, to each of which corresponds a planet - Saturn to the seventh Mansion, Jupiter to the second (Hod), Mars to the third (Nezah) and so forth (ibid., pp. 86-87). The number П would appear to have virtually no significance to either of Herrera's works. The number 0, however, as we have seen derives its importance from the number ** . So great and pervasive is its significance that it rivals the number A, making it necessary to "reduce" the number of sefirot, so to speak, by removing Malkhut, in order to divide Adam Kadmon into groups of three sefirot. Similarly, in the anthropomorphic schemes of Casa de la divinidad the "Vivientes de la Sanctidad" are attributed nine bodily parts. In the structure of Puerta del cielo , however, aside from the number of chapters in the third book, there would seem to be no correlation between chapter contents and the number nine. We have already seen some of the meanings of the number *7, the most perfect of all numbers. Casa de la divinidad elaborates on the analogies with the sefirot in a passage commenting on Isaiah 19: Afterwards (Ein-Sof) created ministers for these vessels or instruments (i.e. the sefirot), which are the throne of glory with four legs or columns and six steps or areas which make ten altogether, with the cup of blessing in which ten things are arranged like the law, which was given in ten commandments; like the creation of the world, which was done with ten pronouncements. And he ordered that ten choirs or squadrons of angels administer to the throne, namely the Malachim, Aralim, Hayyot, Ofanim, Hashmalim, Elohim, Bene-Elohim, etc. And he made Samaël and 14</page><page sequence="15">all his troops, which are like clouds to him, the ministers (of the angels) so that they could ride them and come down to the earth, for they are like horses to him.23 Now, the Tetragrammaton yields the value of ten when calculated as follows: yod (Keter) + yod he (Hokhmah, Binah) + yod he vav (Hesed, Gevurah, Tiferet) -I- yod he vav he (Nezah, Hod, Yesod and Malkhut) = ten letters (1+2 + 3 + 4). There are countless groupings of tens in the sublunary world, just as there are in the world of yezirah. Following Aristotle, Herrera divides sublunary entities into ten categories: 1. mixed imperfect things like meteors; 2. mixed perfect things like metals and stone; 3. grasses; 4. lower plants; 5. trees; 6. higher plants; 7. insects; 8. land animals; 9. sea animals; 10. animals of the air ( Casa de la divinidad , p. 65). There are ten celestial levels - the seven planets, the firmament or sphere of the stars, the crystalline sphere and the empyrean, and so forth (ibid.). Cabala also applies the numerological technique of squaring to the doctrine of the sefirot. The basic notion that the activities of Ein-Sof are not carried out or embodied in the ten named sefirot alone but rather in a hierarchy of sefirot that extends above and below these ten stems from the Zohar. Developing this notion, Moses Cordovero states that the ten named sefirot - the sefirot kelim - actually proceed from a higher group, the so-called sefirot of the hasmut (being or identity) of Ein-Sof. The sefirot of the hasmut, Herrera writes, are "one with Ein-Sof, so that ... they are in total, perfect union with him, and these ten sefirot are in effect the soul and vitality of the other ten sefirot which they encircle and with which they clothe themselves and which are the one that we identify with names" (unidas con el de modo que ... son del todo union perfecta y pura y estas Sephiroth son como anima y vivification de otras dies en que ze enbuelven y visten y que son aquellas que determinamos en nombres; VI, 3, fo. 65v). The sefirot kelim in turn as mentioned above (citation from Book VIII, Chapter 4), generate the ten sefirot of beriah etc. Or as Herrera puts it in Book I, Chapter 17: "In each of the ten emanated sefirot all ten are included, and in each of these ten another ten, and so on virtually ad infinitum" (en cada una de las dies Sephiroth emanadas se yncluyen todas dies, y en cada una destas dies otras dies, y assy casi en ynfinito; fo. 7v). "Virtually" ad infinitum because as Herrera constantly reminds us there can be no infinite regress - that is, there must of necessity be a final or ultimate term, that point at which the many can no longer be multiplied but rather abut directly on the One. Extremely large numbers can be generated in this way. The number of angels, for instance, can be calculated at 25,000. In Casa de la divinidad, Herrera arrives at this figure, 23 Casa de la divinidad : "Despues (Ein-Sof) crió Ministros à estos Vasos ó Instrumentos, que son la Silla de la Gloria, con Quatro Pies ó Colunas, y Seis Escalones ó Prados, que en todos hazen Diez; com (sic) el Vaso de la Bendición, en que se hordenaron Diez Cosas; como la Ley; que fué dada con Diez Mandamientos' como la Criación del Mundo, que se hizo con Diez Dichos: Y hordenó à la Silla, Esquadrones ó Choros de Angeles, que administrasen, a saber Malachim, Aralim, Hayôth, Ophanim, Hasmalim, Elohim, Benè-Elohim, etc. Y a estos Ministros: à saber Samaël y todas sus Equadrillas; que le son como Nuves, para cavalgar en ellos, y descender à la Tierra; y le son como Cavallos." Pp. 5-6. On p. 80 Herrera makes it clear that he is following Maimonides' version of the angelical hierarchy, and that it is not easy to choose because there are so many different versions. 15</page><page sequence="16">which is mentioned in the Zohar , by multiplying the number of parzufim (5) by the number of sefirot kelim (10), making 250, and then multiplying this number by 10 for the realm of the throne of glory (beriah) an 10 for the world of creation (yezirah).24 In general, however, the meaningful numbers are few and mostly restricted to the first hundred. The number H *&gt; (eleven) is associated with the evil spirits or kelippot, who divide themselves into eleven gradations because "they were not satisfied with the perfect number ten ... trying instead to represent what is totally unrepresentable and to express in a number what is quite beyond number" (No se contentaron con el Perfecto Numero Diez ... sino pretendiendo representar al que es del todo Irrepresentable, y incluir en Numero al que lo excede; p. 15), the implication being that evil should not be expressed with something which also expresses the infinite creative power and, therefore, goodness of Ein-Sof. More specifically, the number eleven is obtained by adding the value of 1(6), which is that of Ze'eir Anpin - "who embraces the six sefirot of the foundation" -, and the value of ï' (5), the final letter of the Tetragrammaton, which signifies Malkhut the holy one ("Zeher- Anpin, que es la 1 (Vau) del Nombre Ineffable, que montando 6, abraça las Seis Sephirot de la Fabrica, y de Malchuth la Sancta, que la П (He) postrera del mismo Nombre, que monta 5; p. 18). Evil is less carefully detailed in Puerta del cielo, concerned as the later text is with questions of the first emanation and positive creative activities of Ein-Sof. The number 22 looms large, as it is the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and also the number of principal channels (canales) of communication between the sefirot, which can be drawn as follows: Keter Binah - - Hokhmah G e Tiferei Hod Nezah Yesod I Malkhut the created worlds 24 Casa de la divinidad, Book II, Chapter 8. Two other proofs are given in this same passage. "El Quarto Horden, Grado, ó Mundo, tiene la Proporcion al Primero, que el Mil al Uno." Descending through the three intermediary worlds, then (1- »10- &gt;100- &gt;1000): "Hora 5 es Numero Circular, y 25 es la Primera Convercion y Refleccion, casi Circular Movimiento de si, à si, y por si" (p. 1 12). Now, 25 times 10 for the azilut makes 250, times 10 for beriah makes, 2,5000, times 10 for yezirah makes 25,000. Or, one can argue that the five grades of the Tetragrammaton yield five lights, each of which creates five "divinissimas Animas," and each of these contains 10 sefirot, making 250. These, participated by beriah, makes 2,500 and by yezirah from beriah, 25,000. Each and every angel thus participates directly in the being of Ein-Sof. 16</page><page sequence="17">22 is linked with 26 and 39 in the following way: The name of ЛЯ or 45 comes from the forehead, the name of or 42 is born in the mouth as is the name of ДО and that of , which together, 45 and 42, total 87, like belimah (i.e. + ^ + *&gt; + О + П = 2 + 30+ 10 + 40 + 5 = 87, belimah being roughly synonymous with the emanated sefirot) and T D of the divine head. To this I add that the Ineffable Name adds up to the 26 names which precede it, which are ТПТО , totalling 22. Those that follows are IT ID or 39. And all of these together - 26, 22, and 39 - add up to the number 87, like TD. Furthermore, is proof that 26, the number of the essence, is 22, meaning first, and 39, meaning last, because *ON or 61 is the first and the last ... (which is) the Ineffable Name.25 The numbers 32 and 50 also have special significance: In Hokhmah there are 32 properties or powers called paths, ways or roads, signified by the thirty-two times Elohim is repeated in the creation of the world, wondrously, and in the bet, which is two, and the lamed, which is thirty, with which the divine Pentateuch or five books of the Law begin and end. It also happens that Binah, whose name is Elohim because of the reshit or beginning that Hokhmah represents, created the world and, receiving 32 models and powers from it, as if from its cause, it molded and created 32 effects in its image. The same must be said of the five books of the divine Law which, placed in Malkhut and Tiferet, which are oral law and written law, depend on Hokhmah and Binah, sovereign mother and father, and this following King Solomon the wise: Listen well, my son, to the counsel and advice of your father and do not forsake the law of your mother. Of course the bet or bereshit signifies Hokhmah, the second sefira, and the lamed of Col Israel, with which Deuteronomy ends, gives forth Binah, which is called the tower that flies through the air and is in effect or everything and 50, like the number of both. And it is above Israel, which is Tiferet, or the short-faced one, who is born of Binah as if from a mother along with Malkhut and is raised and fed by them.26 25 Puerta del cielo VIII, 4: "Del nombre de П)Э or 45 que procede de la frente y del deütt о 42 que nace de la boca y es el mismo de ДО y 1^1 y ambos 45 y 42 montan 87, como belimah y T Dde la divina Cabeca, a que añado que el nombre ynefable monta 26 las letras que le preceden que son Ч ГЛО monta 22, las Siguientes que son1T1D39 y todo junto 26:22;39 llega a numero de 87 como TD yMO^ÍOen demostración que 26 el nombre de la essencia es 22 o primero 39 y postrero, según lo de ** o 61...

The discussion of numbers and their significance in Puerta del cielo is not restricted, however, to points of doctrine regarding the creation of the universe: the structure of Adam Kadmon is shown to be reflected in the emotions of men and the features of his earth as well as in the cabalist's book. Herrera uses gematria, for instance, to explain the physical location of Jerusalem in the temperate zone, "which is comfortable to inhabit" (lo que se halla commodamente habitable). Citing a number of authorities (como dize Magino y relata Clavio y Piffero Sansovino... Mercator y Planeio), he remarks on the fact that Jerusalem is situated at 31 degrees and 40 minutes: Regarding the location of Jerusalem, it is significant thatiw , which is the name for grace and mercy, adds up to 3 1 , like the number of degrees, and the three yodim and one alef of the Tetragrammaton of AO or 63 unfolded in ten letters make the same number of 31, and the forty minutes are equal to the sum of the four yodim of the name of ЗУ or 72... In addition to this, 31 and 40 make 71, like the two Ineffable Names of and htt or 26 and 45, which total 72 with the word value of one, like the name of ЗУ . To this we should add that Jerusalem is at 66 degrees of longitude or length counting eastward from the Canary Islands. But 31 and 40 degrees of latitude plus the 66 we have just mentioned add up to 137 - 138 with the word value - as does i?pn , which is the Shekhinah or divine cohabitation...27 That Jerusalem is situated where it is, and that it is the spiritual home of the people of Israel (the Shekhinah) is therefore foreodained by the unfolding of being from Ein-Sof through the various "fillings" of the Tetragrammaton. The above gives some idea of the complexity of Herrera's use of numerology and its relationship to the content of Puerta del cielo at the chapter level. But can we step back and, with the aid of gematria, see how the trees come together to make a woods? Puerta del cielo consists of ten books, and ten is a holy number, the number of sefirot - and this work is nothing if not a meditation on the sefirot. But can we explain the number of chapters in each book by recourse to the significant numbers that Herrera explains? There are 175 chapters in the ten books, 75 in the first three and 100 in the other seven. There may be some numerological significance in this, since three (for the three highest sefirot) times 25 (the square of five - an especially important number, as we have seen) is 75, and of course 100 is the square of 10. With the exception of Book I, which has 45 chapters, and Book II, with 9 chapters, however, the number of chapters does not appear to relate meaningfully 27 Puerta del cielo VIII, 9: "Quanto a la altura de Yerusalem, es de ponderar que que es nombre divino de merced y gracia, monta 3 1 , como sus grados y los tres yodim y un aleph del nombre quadrilitero de A D о 63 esplicado en dies letras haze el mismo numero de 31, y los 40 minutos se ygualan en la quenta arithmetica con los quatro yodim del nombre de^y o 72... demás dello qual 31 y 40 házen 71 como los dos nombres ynefables de 1 3 у ГШ o 26 y 45 y con la diction montan 72 como el nombre de ЗУ ãnadese a lo dicho que yerusalem está en 66 grados de longitud o largueza Contando de las Canarias hazia el Oriente, mas 31 y 40 de altura con 66 que acabamos de dezir montan 137 y con la diction 138 como bp n que es la Seghina o Coabitacion divina." Fo. 1 13. 18</page><page sequence="19">to the number of the book.28 There does not appear to be a consistent, overall structure based on gematria. In addition to those correspondences at the chapter level which have already been mentioned, we can point out the discussion of the six characteristics of sublunary existence not shared by Ein-Sof, in Book I, Chapter 6, and the discussion in Book I, Chapter 1 1 of the number ten as the necessary number of sefirot, and not either nine or eleven. More than in any other book, these correspondences are found in Book I: Chapter 32 relates the 32 properties of Hokhmah, Chapter 22 the 22 channels of communication between the sefirot, etc. In Book III, Chapter 6 gives 6 proofs of the infinity of Ein-Sof, while VIII, 16, discusses 16 functions of the parzufim. Herrera did not let an opportunity go by to use numerology in this sense. A true adept of gematria might be able to discover an overal structure, including an answer to the puzzling breaks in Books II and IV, where the reader is referred forward to chapters 1-8 of Book X (from chapters 6-13 of Book II), to Chapter 1 of Book VI (from IV, 3) and to chapters 1 and 2 of Book VII (from IV, 3). To the amateur, no such structure is apparent. What is clear, however, is that in his use of gematria Herrera shows himself to be a faithful adherent of tradition - the tradition of the Zohar , of Moses Cordovero and of Isaac Luria as interpreted by Israel Sarug. It is clear, that is, from the original works he wrote in Spanish. If he were guilty, as his critics would have had it, of betraying cabala in the name of a higher allegiance to Platonic or Christian theology, why would he have insisted on the universal truth of such profoundly and uniquely cabalistic tenets of Lurianic cabala as zimzum and the tikkun ha-parzufim? After all, it was an accepted 28 By adding the simple numerical values of the names of each number one arrives at a numerical value for each of the ten books. Book I, for instance, would indicate 1 1 1 ( D 1 )yields 1 ( N ) + 30( ) + 80( 0 ) = 111). Comparing these values to the number of chapters, even when a number of operations are introduced (such as adding 1 for the value of the word itself, or adding 1 + the number of letters in the word, or using the single-digit value of letters normally expressed in the tens or hundreds), yields no discernible connection without introducing implausible complexities. Book IV (*T =11^1 = 4 + 30 + 400 = 434) has 7 chapters, and no plausible sum or square or combination of the two applied to fit? *7 yields this number. The same is true if we work combinations on the name of the fourth sefirah, ТОП, whose simple sum is 72 ( ])(8 (П) -I- 60 ( 0 ) + 4 ( ). This of course is one of four values of the Tetra grammaton, but it does not bear a clear relationship to the number 7. The various values are as follows: Book # Name of Sefirah Value of Sefirah Number of Chapters I. К 620 45 И. n ГШЭП 73 21 75 III. A 77 9 IV. 1 ТОП 72 7 V. n ГП1 ЗА 216 12 VI. 1 ГПК£)Л 1081 15 VII.

Universal analogy was rooted in a deeply theistic world view, and in the cabalist's mind the nuggets of truth arrived at by the great Christian theologians and pagan philosophers were not only generally valid but had of necessity to be reconciled with the great tradition of Jewish mysticism. Abraham Cohen de Herrera thus belonged to a line of cabalists extending back to Isaac Ibn Latif, and he had much in common with Christian cabalists like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Paul Ricci: where they cited cabala to uphold the legitimacy of Christian doctrine, Herrera cites them to enhance the truth of cabala. This procedure was particularly consonant with the international atmosphere and tolerance of seventeenth century Amsterdam and helps to explain why the cabalist Herrera, himself the victim of Spain's embroilment in European affairs as the great power of the age and son of a father born in Cordoba, at the same time a European man of his times by education and experience, found in that city the security and stimulation to undertake a synthesis of several traditions. The richness and complexity of Puerta del cielo are testimony to both the man and the community in which he lived. 20</page></plain_text>
