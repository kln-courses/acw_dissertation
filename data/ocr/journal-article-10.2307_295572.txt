<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS section on Words, Feet, and Accents, Soubiran is especially guilty of a meth- odological gaucherie that provoked my annoyance throughout the book. His standard method for the comparative analysis of poets from Euripides to Sen- eca is to examine sample passages of 500 verses. At times, however, he uses samples that are either shorter or longer than this norm, yet he still presents the comparative results in absolute numbers. See, for example, the end-of-line charts on pages 379 and 385, which may seriously mislead the inattentive or casual reader. Soubiran seems aware of this problem, which could have been avoided by a greater reliance on percentage calculations. If asked to identify the most salient features of the work, as a whole, I would cite its synoptic overview of metrical practices in Greek and Latin, from Euripides to Pervigilium Veneris. I would also mention its constant demonstra- tion of the close parallels between the iambic senarius and the trochaic sep- tenarius, two meters that seem so contrasted in nature (diverbium and canticum) and so different in form. A word of praise is due to CNRS for the amazingly accurate production of a book that must have been a typesetter's nightmare. I have noted a few trivial errors, but only one that might cause any confusion: in a column heading on the chart, p. 352, a longum should be changed to a breve. PETER L. SMITH UNIVERSITY OF VICTORIA SVEN-TAGE TEODORSSON. A Commentary on Plutarch's Table Talks, Vol. I (Books 1-3), Vol. II (Books 4-6). Goteborg 1989, 1990. Pp. 393 and 302. (Studia Graeca et Latina Gotoburgensia LI, LIII) The nine books of Quaestiones Convivales have been better served by translators and commentators in recent years than many possibly more deserv- ing parts of the Moralia. This commentary is much the most exhaustive we have; and, as QC itself is a mine of learning-antiquarian, literary, philosophi- cal, scientific and medical-as well as a prime source of information about Plutarch's society, so Teodorsson's annotations provide an exceptionally rich collection of material on a great variety of subjects. The list of "keywords" in the "Abstract" in Vol. II rightly includes, besides all the leading philosophers, "pork, evil eye, bulimy, .. . truffles, lightning, . . . snow, vapour, fish." In fact, once the work is completed, and so long as it is then provided with a really good index, it should become a standard reference tool, not only for Plutarch special- ists, but for many others as well, especially students of Greek science and medicine. The Introduction is brief; and Teodorsson has not chosen to discuss questions of genre, composition, and realism at any length, or with much so- phistication. On the other hand, almost all textual difficulties are dealt with in the commentary, and many useful suggestions made. This is a difficult text, 309</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS often corrupt and lacunose. The commentary is also strong on stylistic detail (notably hiatus) and on scientific and medical matters. What is known about the participants in the dialogues is reported in the due places, but there is no general view of the society they represent, or of Plutarch's techniques of characteriza- tion. So there is a lot of valuable material, but it is scattered; and that is why a good index would be so very desirable. Before offering a few marginalia, I should say that I may sometimes have misunderstood; the English, especially in the first volume, is too often un- idiomatic and incorrect, and (if it is not churlish to say so) would have profited from a thorough revision. There are also quite a lot of misprints, such as modern book-production seems to generate. Marginalia Vol. I, p. 15: is Petronius really a younger contemporary of Plutarch? If he was the Neronian courtier, consul before 66, he must have been a good deal older. 613A: I should prefer [ ev ] olt 6' 6 vuv xaQO6g, because, although Te.'s point about the preceding clause is sound, iE does not construe well with xalQ6g. 615E: &amp;avb6 6ivcO is, of course, Aemilius Paulus, whom P. is about to quote. Te. clearly sees this, but yet says "as Plut. uses this line here . . . it is strictly out of place." This is probably just a matter of wording, but the impression is confus- ing. 616D: how can ocaTQanlxo6 "connote" both 'envious' and 'pedantic'? The point is simply that a "governor's dinner" is an official one in which precedence is strict. 618F: Tx&amp; xdaXXoxa remains difficult. In Aristides II 337D, cited by Te., it is indeed ironical, but not adverbial, and I find the article difficult. Perhaps recon- sider Ta iLCXoTcta (Bernardakis and others), a known idiom and a palaeographi- cally easy change. 625E: [ETeiXov can hardly be right; in Alex. 52.8, cited by Te., the genitive 66or1g is present, and this makes all the difference. 631A: I think I before OECOV should be deleted, with Hubert and others. If a man has the benefit of )rIFtal and ieQa, his consequent success is due to the goodwill of the gods, which these things manifest. The three items do not form a list. 631C: nJoakk06tiEvot seems to mean 'censuring', in an extension of the legal sense in LSJ s.v. IV. 631E: on Aristotle's "Old" and "New" Comedy, see now R. Janko, Aristotle on Comedy, 242ff., with Schenkeveld, Gnomon 58 (1986) 216f. 632A: 6onou xai is characteristically used in a fortiori arguments, and is not adequately described as a "causal" conjunction, or well rendered "in as much as." 632EF: on the whole, I think the Spartan's remark to the gymnasiarch who provided firewood that did not smoke is relevant to P.'s train of thought. It is praise concealed as blame, because smoke was undesirable, and the gym- nasiarch took pains to provide dry wood, not green wood or kinds that are b6uoxactva (cf. Theophrastus de igne 70-71). 310</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 633A: 6o;TI g implies that the lyre is compared to a dog guarding the door, which the visitor very naturally asks the householder to tie up. 633C: I would hazard abvaxcTOv iLaVTeUeL T/IV ooxr)Qilav, because it is a proph- ecy that the man has made (owo0cIrj). 639A: This correction, he says, "makes the substitution of [Lev for b6 after vTwav0a necessary." Not good method, I suspect. The problem here is that it is unsure where the lacuna is. There may well have been a nx6TE-ov-clause after YEYoveCvaC ntQoxov, with I then introducing the alternative, and another lacuna where Xyl. marked it. 640A: PgiQLO' o;&amp;tXTLoJnaag is the first half of a line which is not a pentameter: see E. Fraenkel, Aeschylus' Agamemnon, p. 830. 641B: I suspect na06vTov is corrupt. Perhaps ElcayovTov should be consid- ered: "one heard people bringing up many other instances .. ." 646C: here the traditional explanation seems more nearly right than Te.'s. [te- TQiog J)?En T&amp;S T TapokXag means "tolerate the changes without undue dis- tress": cf. Antony 73.4. The sense of the whole is, "so that the trees tolerate the changes without undue distress when they are subjected to heat and cold." 652A: an unsolved problem. I do not see how to construe Te.'s 6otiLXtoaSg. Should it be 60ixtrXoavTa, sc. oivov? It still seems an odd word. Consider per- haps dbg av EXovoiL . . tlyeLioag sc. aoi0ov;g: i.e., "and (the wine) accepts other (atoms) from the body, which mingle (with it) according to our various temperaments or natures." Another possibility would be to keep EXCoo but change /Idv to l?it;. 660E: a good idea to revive ZcooaxoTQnv. There should be a general reference to Bidez-Cumont, Les Mages hellonises, and to Dio, Or 36, to illustrate the interest of a contemporary of P.'s in Zoroaster. 663A: why is it "far-fetched" for "a physician to refer to Empedocles"? It seems perfectly natural; and we owe some of our fragments (A79-80, A98, B67) to medical writers. 663B: I miss a note on zravqyvQtx6v. This word-'festal'-is a very unexpected one to apply to the body. It perhaps means 'grand, wonderful, elaborate', like festival orations; but we really need a word which more clearly expresses com- plexity: zavTolov or nravTo6ba6v would give the sense, but neither seems likely. 666E: the reference is to Plin., Ep. 10.116, and the verb videantur is needed to complete the quotation. 673B: on (lXko0xeaFov, I remain unrepentant, and think that "fondness for spec- ulation or contemplation" is closer to what P. means. The contrast he stresses is that between physical and mental pleasure, the latter existing even in ()ogTLxoi. With this interpretation, there is difficulty in To ... (lk6oooo v i(I(Ig pvX/ig, which I think forms a single idea with the )LXo0eaRtov phrase. 676DE: no note on oxoXkLv ej?iyantqa, surely a strange expression. What is the justification for Fuhrmann's translation 'allegorique'? Hoffleit uses the term 'skolion'. If this is right, should we delete exiyQcatica? 688D: b(oavapkaTroivxog remains puzzling. Plu. seems to be personifying the 311</page><page sequence="4">312 BOOK REVIEWS parts of the bodily system involved (note 6e6F?vov xal rToOovta), and it is possible that a more "anthropomorphic" term would be in place: perhaps 6voa- vacoXexo-6Vog 'hardly enduring, bearing with difficulty' would do. 693F: (o .... T.XouOvyieLav is not an iambic trimeter (as Te. seems to imply) but a hexameter! We should look forward eagerly to the completion of this solid and valu- able commentary. Future editors and translators of QC will of course find it indispensable; but many others will discover it as a work of reference. D. A. RUSSELL ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, OXFORD</page></plain_text>
