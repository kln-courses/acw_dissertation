<plain_text><page sequence="1">Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Vol. LXXXII ] [ 2001 ARCHAIC GREECE AND THE VEDA By Nicholas Kazanas I) Introduction Many studies by classicists (= scholars of Greek) have since the 190s (and some before) drawn attention to affinities between the archaic Greek culture and Near Eastern (NE hereafter1) ones in religion, mythology, poetry and arts and crafts: eg P Walcot (1966), M L West (1966, 1978, 1988, 1997a, 1 997b etc .) , W Burkert ( 1 977 , 1 987 , 1 992 etc .) , C Penglase ( 1 994) , orientalist S Dalley (1998) and many others. Except West, who invariably refers to early Indie sources as well, most of the others seem to be unaware of any affinities between the Greek and Indie culture and play down the fact that the Greeks who came in waves onto the shores of the Aegean (from about the middle of 'the third millennium down to about 1200 BC) were undoubtedly people who spoke an Indo European (IE hereafter1) language and therefore most probably i Abbreviations for languages used are : A v = Avestan; E = English; Gk = Greek; Gmc = Germanic; L = Latin; Lth = Lithuanian; Ltv = Latvian; Men = Mycenaean; S = Sanskrti; SI = slavonie; V = Vedic For economy of space are used abbreviations for some texts and books given in the Bibliography in full.

A fair proportion of these forms (only few names of deities in the Mycenaean extant documents) appear in the archaic texts (Homer and Hesiod and survive as established elements in the Greek civilization of later periods. The above-mentioned classicists are certainly right in establishing Geek parallels with, and borrowings from, the NE traditions, but they are just as certainly wrong to ignore the Greek affinities with the Vedic culture and with that of other IE peoples, and ascribe - as they do - such elements also to NE influences. No doubt many elements in the Greek culture2 derive from, or at any rate were common with, those of the Near East. Contacts between Minoan Crete and Syria and Egypt or other NE countries are in clear evidence from about the late 3rd millennium (Hood 2000) and exchanges of goods, patterns and techniques early in the second (Warren 2000 : 2-6); there may have been religious influences from Egypt c 1990 (Carinci 2000 : 32-4) and certainly soon after the Egyptian hippopotamusgoddess Taweret was adopted in Crete with minor transformations in the extant iconography (Weingarten 2000 : 1 14- 5,118); undoubtedly there are similarités in cult much ealier between Minoans and Anatolians (Çatal Hüyük) due to contacts, exchanges, perhaps even migrations from Anatolia (Dietrich 1974 ; chapters 1,2). Such contacts, exchanges and transmissions continued in the Mycenaean and subsequent periods so that S Dalley can say "There was not simply one 'orientalizing' period, there were several" (1998 : 86)3 . However, Dalley is quite probably wrong in suggesting that the art of birdangury (as attested in a Greek inscription of the 6th century) derives from Mesopotamia (1998 : 100) - the two texts quoted from Greece and Mesopotamia being quite different, anyway.4 This kind of divination is amply attested in the very earliest Vedic culture and west ofGreece, among the Celts (MacCulloch 1948 : 55-6). Now, while it is possible that this art of divination spread from Mesopotamia westward to Greece and 2 This will hereafter indicate the archaic period, that is 8th and 7th centuries, otherwise the era will be specified as post-archaic, classical or Hellenistic. The dates given are of course BC. 3 The term 'orientalizing' is something of a misnomer. It does not really mean that Greek culture acquired 'oriental* features (except in Hellenistic times, ie after 300). Greeks borrowed much material from the Near East but in almost all instances transformed this into distinctly Greek forms. As Plato(?) wrote in Epinomis 989 D-E, "The Greeks render more beautiful whatever they obtain from foreigners." 4 The Greek text : If (a particular bud) flying from right to left disappears from view, (the omen is) favourable ... If, flying from left to right, it disappears in a straight course, unfavourable." The Mesopotamian text : "If many eagles keep flying over a city, the city will be besieged."</page><page sequence="3">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 3 Gaul, it is equally possible that the Celts, Greeks and Indo Aryans inherited this practice from the ProtoIndoEuropean (PIE hereafter) phase. In this paper I trace parallels between the Greek culture and the Vedic tradition, referring to other IE peoples and using philological considerations wherever possible. Wherever we find Greek- Vedic parallels, these are very probably inherited forms, since it is unlikely that Greeks and Indo Ary ans had, after the dispersal of the IE Peoples in the 3rd or 4th millennium or before, contacts of any great significance. The area of Mythology has been extensively explored since the 19th century of our Era by Max Müller, Cox, Fisko, Oldenberg, Hillebrandt, et al (for a useful brief summary see Arora 1981 : 177 and n 1) and of course by many more scholars in the 20th century Dumézil, Polomé, Puh vel, et al). I do not think that the exploration of Comparative Mythology has been exhausted, nor that a full and correct evaluation of the realtionship between the different IE traditions has been established despite the various tripartite, structuralist and other approaches to this subject - and I hope to show the reason for this in the course of this discussion. I shall not examine mythological themes and motifs like the Deluge or the Four Ages (in India) or Five (in Greece), nor congnations like Zeus/Dyaus , Ouranos/Varuna etc, that have been repeatedly discussed. However, in addition to circumstantial mythological motifis, I shall examine parallels in social practices, rituals and magic, in the broadest sense of the term.5 For instance, Cheiorn's school on 5 Indie sources used here will be mainly the hymns of the Rgveda and Atharvaveda and to a lesser extent the Brãhmanas, Upanisads and the Nirukta' on few occasions I have recourse to the Sütras and the epics, Mahãbhãrata and Rãmãyana (MB and Ra hereafter). The mainstream academic opinion on the dates of ancient Indian texts is that after the Aryans entered North Western India c 1500, they composed the RV c 1200-1000 (or even later), the AV c 1000, the Brãhmanas and Upanisads c 800-600, the Sütras 600 BC and after and the epics (in their present form) right down to c 300 CE. In the last decade of the 20th century some Sankritists in the West have raised questions and objections to the mainstream view. Prof Aklujkar (British Columbia, Canada) does not consider the dates incontestable and states "only relative chronology has been well argued for" (1996 : 66 and n 14); see also Feuerstein et al 1995, passim; Frawley (Director of the Vedic Institute, Santa Fe) 1992 : 25-7. Having accepted and taught the mainstream theory for some 20 years, I too abandoned it in view of the mounting evidence against it. I presented the full evidence in The Rgveda and Indo-Europeans ' ( 1 999) , positing 3 1 00 BC as the completion of the RV. Only a brief summary can be given here. The Indo Aryans are indigenous to the Seven-river region in what is today North Pakistan and N-West India, since there is no evidence whatever for any intrusion into the area prior to c 500 BC. (Allchins 1997 : 191 , 222; Shaffer and Lichtenstein 1995 : 135). The RV (Continued on the next page)</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) mount Pelion where many heroes like Achilles received their education sounds very much like an old Druidic or Vedic school (today known as 'ashram' &lt; 1 ãsramà) where the tradition was oral; very different were the NE traditions of education and learning where writing was predominant and the teaching, apart from the master-apprentice relationship in Egypt (Aldred 1984 : 192-5) and elsewhere, was conducted in schools that were royal establishments or connected to temples (Saggs 1989 : 100, 105). II) Oral tradition (and literacy) In my view the most important feature shared by the Indoaryans and the Greeks, ie the Mycenaeans and subsequent IE-speaking entrants, is the oral tradition. The Minoan civilization (non-IE) was literate but its few written (Continued from p. 3) was complete but for minor passages by 3100 when the Harappan culture begins to arise. The Brãhmanas and Sütras know of town-life, large buildings, fixed altars, bricks, cotton, rice and silver-elements present in the Harappan culture but unknown in the R V . Moreover, many hymns in the RV (especially 11,41; VI, 61; VII, 95) praise the Sarasvati river which flows mightily from the mountains to the Indian ocean, but c 2000 had become a minor stream lost in the desert, hundreds of miles before reaching the occan. In addition, linguistic and literary evidence shows that Vedic is far older than any other IE branch, including Hittite or Avestan. Consequently I take it that RV was composed in the 4th millennium at least, the Brãhmanas and Upanisads early in the 3rd and some of the Sutra texts c 2500 BC. The Rãma legend is older than the great war of the Mahãbhãrata. The core of both must have been in circulation in epic narrative in the 3rd millennium (Rãma tales much earlier) but was expanded by the bards with much additional material reaching the subsequent enormous length early in the Christian Era. Of great significance are two articles by American historian of science A Seidenberg wherein he argues that Egyptian, Babylonian and Greek Mathematics derive from the Indie Šulbasutras of Ãpastamba and Baudhãyana, or a work like that, dated at c 2000 BC as lower limit, thus furnishing totally independent evidence : in these he took account of the work of Neugebauer, Cantor et al (see Bibliography). Seidenberg wrote of this original work : "its mathematics was very much like what we see in the Sulvasutras [šulbasutras]. In the first place, it was associated with ritual. Second, there was no dichotomy between number and magnitude. ... In geometry it knew the Theorem of Pythagoras and how to convert a rectangle into a square. It knew the isosceles trapeziod and how to compute its area... [and] some number theory centered on the existence of Pythagorean triplets... [and how] to compute a square root. ... The arithmetical tendencies here encountered [ie in the Šulbasutras ] were expanded and in connection with observations on the rectangle led to Babylonian mathematics. A contrary tendency , namely , a concern for exactness of thought ... together with a recognition that arithmetic methods are not exact, led to Pythagorean mathematics. (1978 : 329)</page><page sequence="5">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 5 documents have not been deciphered as yet. Literacy was present also in the Mycenaean period, though limited to palaces and temples, and the language was IE, as revealed by the decipherement of Linear B (Ventris &amp; Chadwick 1973). There followed 300 years of non-literacy after the destruction of the Mycenaean centres of culture from the 12th to the early 8th century (Taylour 1983 : 41), usually termed 'Dark Age' and then literacy re-emerged with the adoption by the Greeks of the Phoenician alphabet and its transformation with the introduction of written symbols for vowels and separate symbols for consonants. But it is doubtful whether the proto Greeks who first established themselves on the shores of the Aegean c 1900 were literate. The later writing is syllabic, resembling other NE types. It is safe to assume that they brought no writing with them and eventually, in the 16th or 15th century, adopted the Cypriot-Minoan mode of writing. It is very difficult to know exactly that the proto Greeks brought with them from the PIE stock. The clay tablets discovered at Knossos and other spots on Crete and at Pylos, Mycenae and other places on the mainland (= Mycenaean Documents) are mainly inventories, containing no literature and very little information about religion . However, among sporadic references to votive offerings, some names of deities stand out, easily recognizable as IE. Thus we find Zeus (V dyaus, Ht DSiu-s, RM ju[s]-piter , Gmc Tiwaz)' Areimene (V Aryaman, Clt Ariomanus in Gaul and Eremon in Ireland); Iqej -a/-o, names for a Horse-god/-goddess (Dietrich 1974 : 176, n 246 : Chadwick 1976 ; 93) connected obviously with V Ašvin and Clt Epona, a horse-deity in Gaul; Erinus is obviously connected with Demeter Erinys of Arcadia, rather than the dreadful Furies (Burkert 1977 : 85), and with V Saranyu ;6 a goddes Diwija z S divija 'skyborn' or S divya 'celestial'; Burkert gives also Alle Götter' All gods' (1977 : 83) which is Men pa-si te-oi (Ventris &amp; Chadwick, p 3 10) and clearly V visve-deväh 'all gods'. Thus we have some evidence that the Mycenaeans preserved elements of their IE heritage and this through oral tradition. This tradition continued during the subsequent centuries of non-literacy; for, apart from Zeus and Erinys, the names of Hera and Athena, and several other deities re-emerged in the poetry of Homer and Hesiod in the late 8th century. (For continuity and innovation in archaic Greek religion see Dietrich 1974 : 246ff and Burkert 1977 : 99ff.) 6 The saranyu! erinus cognation is rejected by KEWA III, 442 (as also in Frisk 1954 ff). However, since KEWA accepts the S/Gk cognations ä sama/amo-then, sarvalholo-lhoulo, sarpami/herpõ, si-sarmilhallomai and iallõ and saipisdelpos-elphos (all in vol III), there can be no reason, phonetic or semantic, for the rejection of saranyu/ erinus : non-initial S -a- often appears as -i- in Gk as in dadãmi/didõmi.</page><page sequence="6">6 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) In the 12th century, it is thought, the Dorian tribes, another IE-speaking people, swept through northern Greece, spread and eventually some of them reached and settled in the Peloponese (Tay lour 1983 : 16, 162). No writing is attested anywhere in Greece until c 800 and, when written records appeared in the 8th century , only few of the older Mycenaean cultural elements survived in the beginnings of what is regarded as the Greek civilization, culminating in the brilliance of the classical period. It may be thought that with the advent of writing the oral tradition ceased, but this is not so. Many examples are attested down to classical times pertaining to 'esoteric' knowledge, through the teacher-disciple and father-son relationship, in religion and priestly functions, healing, divination, and the like (B 43ff). At the time of Euripides, when literacy was widespread (Murray 1993 : 100), one of the characters in Melanippe the Wise says "How sky and earth separated is not my tale but one from my mother" (frag 4877) thus showing that cosmogonie or théogonie accounts still passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth. P. Kingsley again stresses how oral transmission in esoteric cults like the Pythagoreans and others persisted into Hellenistic and even Roman times ( 1 995 : 322 ff). Now while classicists like Burkert link this oral transmission with diviners, healers and the like in NE cultures (B,1 44-5), this is a preeminent feature of early IE as well. It is attested among the Celts, as Caesar writes in De Bello Gàllico VI, 13 : "[The Druids] are concerned with divine worship... sacrifices... ritual... Numerous young men gather round them for the sake of instruction holding them in great honour"; in eh VI, 14 he adds, "In the schools of the Druids they learn by heart a great number of verses, and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training. And they do not think it proper to commit these utterances to writing, although in almost all other matters... they make use of Greek letters." The Germanic and Baltic peoples also must have had an oral tradition, even though it is not so clearly attested, or so retentive, otherwise they would not have preserved respectively the deities Fjorgyn and Perkunas, which z SI Perun (and variants) and V Parjanyœ, much of the IE common lexical stock; and IE legends, like Thor's confrontation with the serpent Midgard in the ocean (Gmc) and the songs about Dieva Deli (Ltv; 7 For fragmentary works of Euripides see T B L Webster's The Tragedies of Euripides, London 1967.</page><page sequence="7">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 7 or Dievo Sünelai Lth) 'the [Sky-] god's sons' and the Sun's daughter ( Saules meita Ltv or Saules dukterys Lth) this Baltic legend corresponding in part to the Greek Dioskouroi 'sons of Zeus' and Vedic Ašvinau who accompany Süryä 'Sungod's daughter' (or Usas). It should be noted here that there is no direct parallel between the Greek and Baltic legends beyond 'skygod's lads.' The Greek legend has two pairs of twins, Castor (one Dioskouros) and Klytaemnêstra (Agamemnon's wife), and Polydeukes (second Dioskouros) and beautiful Helen (of Troy, ie Menelaus's wife) while the two Dioskouroi are expert horsemen and rescue people from shipwrecks ("Hymn to Dioskouroi ' in Loeb, 460-2; GM I, 245-50); the Baltic legend has sometimes one, sometimes two or many, Skygod's sons who woo the Sun's daughter and save her from drowning (Ward 414-5; Puhvel 228-9). The link between Greek and Baltic is furnished by the Vedic lore about the Ašvin horsemen (one set of twins of Saranyü and Vivasvat in RV X, 17, 1-2 &amp; Nirukta XII, 10) who are healers and rescuers (often from shipwreck) and thus are connected with Dioskouroi, and who accompany the Sungod's daughter Sûryâ (and in RV VI, 60, 2, rescue abducted Usas, who is sometimes identified with Süryä), and thus are connected with the Baltic heroes. Although, the Slavs and the Romans had no myth of the Divine Twins, they must have had a similar mode of oral transmission. In the Vedic culture the oral tradition is very marked. The Vedic texts preserved much more of the PIE stock of legendry than any other IE branch. In fact no major mythological feature appears in two or more IE branches to the exclusion of the Vedic one, while, on the contrary, feature after feature appears in the Vedic lore in common with one or two other branches to the exclusion of the rest (disregarding the affinities of Vedic and Avestan since these two traditions formed a distinct branch). Thus the motif of the sacrificial dismemberement of primordial Man Purusa and the resultant cosmogony ( RVX , 10) has a parallel in the dismemberment of giant Ymir (z V yama) in the Norse tradition but nowhere else; the name of Vedic Firegod Agni appears only as the Slavic Ogon (and variants) and nowhere else; the name of V artificers Rbhu is most probably cognate with Gk Orpheus and Gms £//but has no mythological connection in the other branches; the same holds for V Vãstos-pati and Gk Hestia and Rm Vesta; and so on. Thus the Vedic corpus seems to be a much more reliable source for PIE mythology than any other IE branch. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that the Vedic texts were transmitted for many centuries through a well organised oral tradition.</page><page sequence="8">8 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) The systematic oral transmission of its voluminous sacred lore (and sacrificial ritual) is a most impressive characteristic of the Vedic tradition. The priestly caste of the brahmins guarded well the knowledge of their šruti (apocalyptic scriptures like the Rgveda). It was the sacred duty of certain families to transmit this knowledge from one generation to the next (Winternitz 1981 : vol I, 29-32, 51-2). When the disciples reached maturity and the teacher felt they could now proceed on their own he instructed them "learn and teach" ( Ch Up 1 IV, 9, 3, &amp; VI, 14, 2; T Up 1, 9, Iff). The teacher-disciple and inter-family father-son relationship is exemplified in the Upanisads : "A father may declare this [teaching about] Brahman to the eldest son or to a worthy pupil" (Ch Up III, 11, 5); later on (VI, 8ff) Uddãlaka is presented instructing his son Švetaketu. Already, in the RV itself we read of the families of Bhrgus, Añgirases, Vasisthas et al, who preserved and transmitted the sacred knowledge. Ill) Epic Poetry 1. "Greek literature is a Near Eastern literature" wrote West in the introduction of his edition of Hesiod's Theogony (1997 : 31). The statement is probably exaggerated for effect, but other scholars express a similar view in more moderate terms (B 88 ff; Dalley 1998 ; 101-3). Undoubtedly, many incidents and features from NE poetry are embedded in the Homeric epics (and other poems of the archaic period). Here, I present only a few of them to indicate this particular debt : in Iliad 15,1 87ff Poseidon describes how the world was divided among the three sons of Rhea, the three high gods, Zeus, Hades and Podeidon himself, by lots, a procedure otherwise unknown in the Greek texts but present early on in the Babylonian epic Atrahasis (MM p 9); Penelope's prayer after her son Telemachus's departure in Odyssey 4, 759 ff, could well derive from a similar incident in the Mesopotamian epic Gilgamesh (Tablet III : MM p 65), where the hero's mother Ninsun offers a prayer after her son's departure; also in Gilgamesh we find that sometimes the action of a new day begins with the first light of dawn (Tablet VII, MM pp 91 , 95) and this is employed by Homer in the Odyssey (opening of rhapsodies 2, 5 etc); there are several more cases. However, apart from very few incidents, like Penelope's prayer which seems to have something non-Greek about it (B 1992 : 99-100), it should be and has been noted that most such borrowings (like also the Phoenician alphabet mentioned above) are usually transformed by the Greeks into terms of their own culture (see n 3, above).</page><page sequence="9">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 9 Despite all such borrowings, Greek epic poetry has its roots in the PIE tradition as is evidenced by some basic features it has in common with the poetry of the Rgveda, even though the latter is not an epic. It is difficult to understand what scholars mean when they write of "Indo-European heroic tradition," since apart from Homer's works there are no other IE epics until very much later. The Hittites or Anatolians (also IE) left us much material in verse and prose, the earliest of which was written down 8 or 9 centuries before Homer's poems; but most of this derives and is almost indistinguishable from other NE literature. The Romans produced poetry several centuries after the Greeks and mostly imitated them . For the other IE branches , German ic , Celtic , Slavonic and Baltic, we find no written material until after many centuries of the Christian Era. Consequently the only comparisons that can be made in this context are with the RV hymns. We therefore ignore studies on (hypothetical) IE epics or "IE poetics." Besides, features common to, say, Greek and Germanic heroic poetry are found also in the medieval Turkic Alpamysh or the ancient NE Gilgamesh. 2. In the Homeric epic we find, broadly speaking, three types of stock epithet (the examples are mostly from Iliad 1) : a) Vague adjectives like dios 'divine, bright', used of anyone, or diogenës 'nobly born ' of many heroes; these are employed mainly for filling the metrical line. Others are amumõn 'faultless,' megathumos 'big-hearted' and hippodamos 'horse-taming' - all used indiscriminately of Trojans and Achaeans; potnia 'reverend' used of Hera and elder women and kallisphuros 'with beautiful ankles' of any beautiful lady; and so on. b) The second type of epithet is used specifically of a central figure and denotes a distinct feature but could apply to many others : eg Hera 'of white hands' leukõlenos' Athena 'of grey /blue eyes' glaukopis", Dawn 'of rosy- fingers' rhododaktulos' Acheans 'of fine greeves' euknëmis' etc. c) The third type is used exclusively of a particular deity or warrior and denotes a feature that designates a specific attribute or function not found in another figure : eg hekëbolos 'aim-attainer/farshooting' is exclusive to Apollo; asteropëtës 'who throws the bolt' and nephelëgereta 'cloud-gatherer' are exclusive to Zeus; polumëtis 'of many counsels' and polumëchanos 'of many devices' are used Odysseus; the epither pódas õkus 'fleet of foot' is used mainly of Achilles; though õku- and tachu- are used of others too. All three categories are found in the Rgveda - even though it is a collection of hymns to gods and not an epic : a) daivya 'bright, divine' of Savitr (1, 35, 5) and Rudra (II, 33, 7); ugra 'mighty, fierce' of Rudra (II, 33, 9) and</page><page sequence="10">10 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) of a man of power (X, 34, 8); rtavan 'holy , observing order' of Divine Waters (II, 35, 8) and of Mitra and Varuna (VII, 61, 2); citrašravas 'of brilliant fame' of the Firegod Agni (I, 1, 5) and of Mitra (III, 59, 4). b) somapã 'soma-drinker' is exclusive to Indra (eg II, 12, 13), but it could be used of any other god; Rudra is called jalãsa 'cooling', but so could be the Moongod Soma, the Raingod Parjanya and others; Agni alone is described as jãtavedas 'who knows all things manifest' but so could be Varuna or the Sungod who see all things, c) Agni is grhapati 'lord of the house' (I, 45, 1) since a fire is always lit, and daivya hoir 'heavenly priest' (III, 7, 8 and 9); vajrin 'he of the bolt' (VII, 49, 1) is an epithet exclusive to Indra; Visnu is famous as urugãya 'far-going' and urukrama 'wide-striding' (1, 154, 3,5,6); and so on. That Greek epic had a rich inheritance of epithets is made even clearer by its common lexical stock with Vedic : S šravas / sruta z Gk kleos/kluto - 'fame(-d)'; S uru - z GK euru- 'wide-' : S ãsu z Gk õku - 'swift'; S divya/daivya z Gk dios 'divine, celestial, bright'; S patni Gk potnia 'reverend lady'. (For additional "verbal as well as conceptual parallels," West, 1988 : 154-6). 3. The similes in the N/E epics are not numerous but varied as in "His face was like that of a long distance traveller" ( Gilgamesh , MM 53) or "To go on to the battlefield is as good as a festival for young men" (Erra and Ishum, MM 287) and "splendour like the stars of heaven" (ibid, 290). The RV contains a large variety of similes: simple ones as in "[Rudra] kills like a terrifying beast" (II, 33, 1 1); a humorous comparison in "[Frogs] like brahmins at the overnight Soma-sacrifice, speaking around as it were a full lake" (VII, 103, 7); lyrical and elegiac in "As a mother covers her son with a robe, so shroud thou, o Earth, this [dead] man" (X, 18, 11); elliptic and pregnant in "As a cunning gambler carries off the stakes, so the goddess [Dawn] wears away a mortal's lifespan" (1, 92, 10); and one almost Homeric - "Like the rays of the sun that make men hasten, exhilerate, then send to sleep, so flow forth together [Soma's] swift effusions..." (IX. 69, 6). The Greeks may have retained similes (and idioms) from the PIE phase but even if parallels could be established between Greek and Vedic (or Avestan) these could equally well be due to independent development, since the movements during the centuries after the dispersal and the settlement in new environments would naturally produce new usages. So in this area, what is of importance is the continued use of similes, not so much verbal and conceptual parallels which may be fortuitous.</page><page sequence="11">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 1 1 4. An additional aspect of style is that the R V Hymns are composed in various fairly strict metres (Anustubh, Jagati, Tristubh, etc), as the Greek epic line has its own strict metre (the hexameter with its iambic, trochaic, dactylic and other variants), whereas the Mesopotamian epic has only one metrical feature, that of the accent usually resting on the penultimate syllable of the line (Heidel 1965 : 15-6). Moreover, we find in the Hymns alliteration and assonance : ... prasasré apsú' sá piydsam dhayati pürvasünäm 'he has stretched forth in the water; he sucks the new milk of them that first have given birth' (II, 35, 5); tvám agne vãjasã tamam víprã vardhanti sústutam 'Wise singers exalt you, Agni, well-praised, best giver of gain!' (V, 13, 5); sá dundudhe sajúr índrena devaír dãrãd dáviyo ápa sedha Éatrãn 'O drum, along with Indra and the gods, do drive our foes to farthest distance' (VI, 47, 29). Thus it is as though the metrical line foreshadows Greek poetry and the alliteration foreshadows the alliterative poetry of the Celtic (Irish) and of the Germanic peoples. In Greece alliteration appears fully developed in Pindar's poetry (early 5th century) but traces of it are found in the epics, early lyrics and some epigraphic material; the development of all poetic devices in Greece was very rapid. The riddle is another feature common to the Hymns and Celtic and Germanic poetry : eg tigmám éko bibharti hásta ãyudham, šúcir ugró jálãsabhesajahll ... tríny-éka urugõyó vi cakrame yátra devãso madanti// (RV VIII, 29, 5 and 7) : 'One, bright, fierce, with cooling remedies, carries in his hand a sharp weapon' (5) where the "cooling remedies" signal Rudra; 'One far-going, has made three strides to where the gods rejoice' (7) where "far-going" and "three strides" signal Visnu. Many more details of form, style and specific poetic devices will be found in C Watkins 200 1 ( 1 995) passim . . Watkins 's study is invaluable for any student of IE comparative literature, but unfortunately it contains many parallels that are not parallels and many that are universal (or independent developments) and not specifically IE inherited forms (21-2, 25, 31, 38, 53, 99, etc, etc). It also takes for granted the notion common among comparativists that all traditions, Vedic, Hittite, Greek, Celtic, Slavic, etc, stand on the same footing, even though the Hittite one is heavily influenced by the NE cultures (this is admitted on (p 52), while Celtic and, moreso, Slavic literary traditions, which are of late attestation, may well carry elements diffused from Greece and Rome ~~ a point outside the framework of our present discussion. Nonetheless, Watkins does state : "The language of India from its earliest documentation in the Rig-veda has raised the art of the phonetic figure to what many would consider its highest form" (p 109).</page><page sequence="12">12 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) Note. Earlier, in section II, we saw that the legend of the Ašvins in the RV provides information that connects the Greek Dioskouroi and Lithuanian Dievo Sünelai. Here we see that the RV can be said to anticipate both Greek poetic metre and Germanic alliterative poetry : it alone preserves what most probably were common original elements in the PIE but got separated in the other branches. 5 . There are in addition several incidents in Homer which have parallels in the Veda and can thus be regarded as PIE inherited forms, despite similarities in NE texts. We examine only three of them here. In Iliad 15, 34-42, Hera swears the oath to the river Styx, which is regarded as the most severe and weighty oath by the gods (as it is also in Hesiod's Theogony 401 ff). In this instance it has cosmic dimensions being accompanied by Heaven and Earth, and Burkert links it with a parallel in Aramaic (1992 : 93-4). However, this is also a distant relative of the oath to Varuna and cosmic waters as found in Atharvaveda XIX, 14, 8-9. As Keith observes, "Mitra is primarily the Lord of the contract ... [and] Varuna of the oath ... as in the case of the Styx in Greek religion (1989 : I, 103-4). Rhapsody 21 of the Iliad is concerned with Achilles 's fithting with various Trojans by the river Scamander, in it and with the river-deity itself. This too has been linked with river battles in NE texts (B 119) but the incident may well derive from the battle scene in RV VII, 19 (and 33, 3-6) where king Sudäs was hemmed in at the river Parusnï by the confederation of the 10 kings and won with the help of his hierophant, the great sage Vaisistha, and the intervention of Indra (cf the intervention of Hera and Hephaestus in 11 328-77 in the Greek text). As usual the Hymns give no details but the slaughter and the gory corpses are suggested in brief touches. (Detailed descriptions of battles, chariots, corpses and flowing blood will be found in the Indian epics, especially the second day of the war in the Bhïsma Parvan, book VI of MB.) The third incident is the flight of Artemis and Apollo from the battlefield, one compelled by Poseidon, the other by Hera, while their mother Leto is driven off by Hermes (Iliad 15, 435-503). This is reminiscent of RV IV, 28, 2 and 30, 4, where Indra attacks the Dawn and the Sun crushes their chariot and causes them to flee. The echoes are faint, admittedly, but Apollo is also Phoibos which z (Avestan bar/a and) V bhaga who is clearly an aspect of the</page><page sequence="13">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 13 Sungod, while Artemis may be linked with Usas as I suggest further down, sect V, l.8 An additional feature in the Iliad is the mode whereby some heroes reflect on things, ie "they speak to their own 'great-hearted thumos' or to their 'heart' This too Burkert (B 116) connects with NE prototypes; but, of course, we find a similar formulation in the RV - speaking with one's self/spirit (, tanu : VII, 86, 2). There are several other incidents in Homer (and Hesiod) that can be linked with the Vedic texts but enough has been said on this. I am not suggesting that Greek archaic texts, or even the points discussed above, have not been infuenced by NE traditions , but I am claiming that, whatever non-IE influences have affected these Greek narratives, they have many affinities with the Veda and that therefore their IE heritage cannot be denied. IV) Divination Divination was practised extensively in ancient India as is obvious in the Brãhmanas. Not only the flight of birds but also the direction of cows' movements in the Soma sacrifice served as omens for the sacrificer's fortune (SB IV, 5, 8, 1 1); an omen was also taken to be the clarity or otherwise of the fire. The RV hymns II, 42 and 43 already mention birds of omen. In II, 42 the kapiñjala (a kind of heath-cock) is begged to be auspicious ( sumañgala ) : it is so, if it calls from the right or south ( daksinatah ) of the house, from the region of the Ancestors - then no thief or evil-wisher will do harm. Here we have the bird's call from the south or right, as in the Greek text mentioned in n4 it is the bird's flight from right to left. VIII, 47, 15 regards as a bad omen 8 Dr Bhattacharji links Artemis with Durgã, yet on the same page she links Athena with Durgä (1988 : 164). From the viewpoint that all deities are manifestations of the Absolute, this constant identification of different deities with different deities obviously does not matter. But when we compare and contrast so as to discover precise correspondences, such a method is not satisfactory. Many of Dr B' s references to other mythologies (especially Greek) are wrong : eg : "Demeter the mother-goddess of teh Minoans [sic!] was called Demeter Erinyes [sic!]" (p 86); for the Arcadian Demeter Erinys, see section II, above. Throughout the book there is the underlying notion of the conflict between invading Aryans and Dravidian natives (pp 10, 45, 90, 160, 163, 178, etc). It is a pity corrections were not made for the 1988 edition (by which time Archaeology had made it clear that there had been no invading hordes). Otherwise it is an immensely useful study of he historical development of Vedic mythology.</page><page sequence="14">14 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) a dream of making a garland or neckband. Many other phenomena serve as omens - one's shadow appearing upside down in water or in a mirror; meteors and lightning; the scream of a jackal or the neighing of a horse; and so on. However, it must be emphasized that the inspection of entrails, including hepatoscopy (B, 46-53) is not evidenced even in late literature. Burkert mentions also divination and prophesying by ecstatic (or raging) women (B, 80ff). This phenomenon is not at all attested in the Rgveda. The Vedic Index gives two references for female magicians yãtudhãnl, I, 191, 8 and X, 1 18, 8, but in both the word means 'female fiend, demonness' : in the first passage the sun is to destroy these fiends of night; in the second, Agni will burn them up. The same applies to its references to the Atharvaveda. (Of course, there may have been some women who practised some kind of witchcraft : see V, 2, below.) Women were present in rites and in philosophical gatherings, as shown by the intrepid Gãrgi who challenges the sage Yájñavalkya in BUp III, 8, 1 ff, but, according to the texts, there were no seeresses nor priestesses. Both priestesses and haruspication are attested in the early Celtic culture. Citing Pomponius Mela, MacCulloch refers to 9 'priestesses' antistitës on an island off Brittany "who Uved in perpetual virginity", wielded power over sea and wind through spells, healed incurable illnesses, predicted the future to sailors and could assume animal forms (1948 : 76). This account is clearly exaggerated fantasy but there is evidence of 'druidesses' bandrui or ban-filid (Kendrick 1994 : 96-97). Tacitus writes that the Celts in Gaul consulted their deities throught human entrails ( Annals XIV, 30). Among the Nordic people also, goddess Freyja had a divination rite performed by a seeress vplva who fell into a trance or ecstasy (Davidson 1 98 1 : 1 1 7) . The Baits too had priestesses (Puhvel 1989 : 224-5). So the Greeks might have brought such practices with them to the shores of the Aegean. On the other hand, it is possible that this custom spread from the Near East westward and to the north. V) Magic and Purification The Greek, like other peoples, believed in demons, ghouls and ghosts and that these could enter and possess the human organism causing mental and physical illness, even death; also that these could be manipulated by means</page><page sequence="15">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 15 of magical rites, to guard against them or direct them against enemies. A large aspect of the Greek religion consisted in securing protection against these demonic forces or in purification. 1 . Demons and spirits of the dead. In his well-documented study (1992), Burkert discusses extensively demons attacking and causing disease (pp 59, 65), guilt-spirits torturing murderers (56-7) and ghosts of the unappeased dead possessing men (pp 65-6). All these he links with Mesopotamian parallels, but they are all found also in great abundance in the Veda. Attacks of demons causing disease are well attested throughout the Vedic tradition. The Atharvaveda especially is full of such cases. Takman for instance, "god of yellow hue ... son of Varuna" ( AV I, 25 2-3) causes much trouble being the demon of fever : he attacks in autumn and the rainy season (V, 22, 3) like burning fire (VI, 20, 1) and is invoked in a brief spell - one of many - to enter into a frog (VII, 116,2). There are raksasas, demons that assume various forms, like dog or ape (VI, 37, 1 1) or deformed human shapes (VII, 6, 13), and pisãcas, that assume insect forms and the like : they attack a man (or an animal), enter and cause bodily or mental disorder (IV, 37, 1 1 ; V, 29, 5-9) and may finally bring death; they also infest human dwellings and whole villages (IV, 36, 8; etc). Such fiends are found in action in the RV too - I, 133, 5; VII, 104, 10; etc. The Mesopotamian or Vedic "carnivorous demons" do not, of course, cover exactly the case of the Erinyes who pursue Orestes "as beasts of prey, 'dogs' who want to suck his blood" (B, 59). The Veda, however, provides such canine figures. First there are Rudra's dogs that howl and swallow unchewed their prey (AV XI, 2, 30). Then there is Sarama which pursues and finds the thieves of cattle and then Indra recovers the animals (RV X, 108); Sarama is not expressly said to be a bitch in the RV but is so taken by subsequent texts (Nirukta XI, 25). However, the Veda has two more dogs, those of Yama, the guardian of the dead in heaven (RV X, 14, 10-12). Descendants of Saramã (with the epithet Sãrameya ) they are called Šabala (? z Gk Kerberos ) 'brindled' and Syãma 'black', and guard the path of the dead to Yama's abode. "It is possible that they were conceived as going among men, and taking to the abode of death [in heaven] the souls of the dead" (Keith 1989 : II, 406). Be it noted that some think Saramã z Hermes (so SGD, but KEWA III, 442-3</page><page sequence="16">16 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) thinks it improbable). Sarama is Indra's and the gods' (in Nirukta XI, 25) messenger, as Hermes is of Zeus; she finds the stolen catties while Hermes does the stealing of cattle; her offspring Sãrameya guide on the path of the dead, as later Hermes is psuchopompos, escort of the dead to Hades. (Here Burkert sees only the influence of NE gods' messengers in 1977 : 244). The guilt of murder, which attaches to Achilles in Aithiopis and to Orestes (B, 56), is fully recognised in the Veda as well; even the slaying (by Indra) of a demon like Vrtra brings the taint of bloodshed. The killer becomes an outcast to be avoided, as is Orestes (B, 60), and is haunted by his deed ( Paňcavimša Brãhmana XIX, 4, 10). The Sütra texts, which come somewhat later, have the murderer carry the skll of his victim and wear the skin of an ass or dog, thus at once lessening his guilt by this declaration of his crime and warning others to stay away from the unclean person ( Ãpastamba Dharmasütra I, 9, 24, 11-13). Then there are the ghosts of unappeased dead causing "all manner of illnesses on the living" and here Burkert cites numerous cases from Greek texts (pp 65-5). Possession by ghosts is, of course, common in post-Vedic late texts but it is unknown as such in the early texts. However, some spirits of the dead, ghosts that are guilt-ridden souls perhaps undergoing some punishment, do wander among and pester the living ( RV X, 15,2; A V XII, 3, 9). In Vedic texts, possession itself is an action of demons and ghouls only, as we saw earlier in this section. 2. Protection. Many and various means for protection against these demonic forces (and for purification) were used by the Greeks : spells, votive offerings, amulets of all kinds, even effigies, today's "voodoodoll" (B, 60-1, 65-7, 82, 87, 100). It should not come as a surprise that all such means, with some variants here and there, are amply presented in the Veda. The Atharvaveda (and much of the Sutra literature) abounds in various protective, expulsive, offensive and retaliatory means: spells (V, 3 1 , 1 ; etc; in 3a, below, the verses from RV are another such incantation); amulets of all kinds (1, 16, 3 ; etc , etc) ; use of plants (I V , 7 ; VIII , 7 , 3 ; etc) and ointments of all kinds which are sometimes gunuine medicinal remedies (IV, 9,8; etc); carrying round of fire (VIII, 64, 1); and of course water for all occasions . Another feature in these practices is the making of effigies (our of wax and other substances) which are melted, buried or pierced through. These are made by women also and one</page><page sequence="17">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 17 description is in AVX, 1 , 1-3, which also has incantations for protection, they are placed in wells or cemetaries (V, 3 1 , 8). More details are found in the Sütra texts (Keith, II, 389). Burkert (pp 53-5) mentions two types of foundation deposits during the construction or consecration of a house, temple or other building, both in the Near East and Greece: one type consists of precious metals and / or stones, guardian figures and tablets with inscriptions; the other consists of animal sacrifice and libations. The first type, essentially an extension of the second, is unknown in the Vedic tradition. A beautiful Hymn (AV III, 12) describes the consecration of a house invoking gods Savitr 'Sun', Väyu 'Wind', Indra, Brhaspati 'Lord of prayer, priest of gods ', the Maruts 'gods of rain and medicine' (also warrior comrades of Indra), and Bhaga 'Bestower of fortune.' Offerings are made of milk, corn, jars of purified butter and curdled milk, honey and water. In later texts, the Sutra-literature, a black cow or a white goat may be offered and in this Keith finds a similarity to "the black cock killed at the foundation of a new house in Greece" (II, 363). 3 . Purification . Of all purificatory practices in archaic Greece , here we shall concentrate on the catharctic ritual which releases murderers from their blood guilt, although other catharctic practices are employed in circumstances of plague or other forms of pollution. a) The purification ritual whereby a murderer like Orestes gets cleansed consists in having the blood of a slaughtered piglet running down and over the culprit and then the blood being washed off with running water (B 56-7). This procedure is unknown in the Vedic tradition. Such a blood-bath is never used and the animals sacrificed in rituals are horse, ox, sheep and more usually goat (Keith, 1, 279 and n 5). Instead of blood, the Vedic people invariably used running water which removed all sin such as lying, cursing and any crime of violence : "O Waters ( ãpah ), carry off whatever sin is in me, whatever crime I have done, whatever curse or lie" ( RV I, 23, 22, repeated in X, 9,7). b) "Anything left over from the purification must be carefully disposed of", writes Burkert, as much in Greece as in Mesopotamia (B, 62). The same is true in the Vedic tradition : all remnants of the rite must be burnt thoroughly and whatever is left must be buried secretly</page><page sequence="18">18 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) (SB III, 8, 5, 9ff); then all get washed and the last vestiges of uncleannes float away with the running water. c) Another Mesopotamian / Greek parallel for purification is the "young [man] holding. ..a tamarisk, rod of purification" and "Branchos the Apollonian seer" frees the Milesians of the plague by sprinkling them "with laurel branches" while they "spoke the responses" (B, 61). In the Veda we find the use of the plant Apãmãrga 'which drives away' (AV IV, 7; etc) as well as of other plants (AV VIII, 3, 7, 3ff; etc) against diseases, evil dreams and the like. Water and incantations are used simultaneously. d) Of the other details mentioned by Burkert in relation to purification, of interest is Apollo nad Karmanor, the priest who purified the god on Crete after he had slain the Delphic dragon (B, 63). Apollo's adventure and slaying of Typhaon's dragon-fostermother at Delohi (Hymn to Apollo 349-86) is really a repeat of Zeus's slaying of Earth's dragon-offspring Typhoeus (Theog 820-68). The name Apollon is of uncertain derivation but his epithet Phoibos sounds cognate with (Avestan baya and) S Bhaga 'Bestower of fortune', a Vedic deity that is clearly an aspet of the Sungod ' the S/GK correspondences bh/ph and gib are quite normal. However it is Indra the Thunder-and-Storm-god, with a solar aspect also, who kills the demon-dragon Vrtra; Indra is also the 'bolt-bearer' vajrin and so related to Zeus; mention is also made of Vrtra 's dragon-mother (R VI, 32, 9). The Vedic and the two Greek myths are obviously one and the same in origin. Connected with this is the Teutonic myth of Thor, who wields the hammer Mjolnir and slays the serpent Midgard that encircles the world (as Vrtra encompasses - ãsayãna - the Waters), but is himself killed in the process (Edda, 46-7 and 54). The Apollo myth has the element of water with the presence of the stream Telphusa, as Midgard lives in the ocean and Vrtra covers and wallows in the Waters; thus it is closer to the Vedic tale than the Zeus mythologem. Moreover, Indra, like Apollo, feels guilt after slaying Vrtra and rushes off distraught (RV I, 32) - whereas Zeus has no blood-guilt. Indra's guilt and expiation is mentioned in later texts and is developed with epic exuberance in the Mahãbhãrata (V, 13 and XII, 272) where Indra gets purified with the performance of a horse-sacrifice. (For additional Apollo-Indra affinities see VI, 2, below.)</page><page sequence="19">Kazan as : Archaic Greece and the Veda 19 Burkert feels that the name Karmanor "does not seem to be Greek" (B, 63). We are not told who officiated in Indra 's horse-sacrifice. Karmanor sounds like S šramana 'a wandering ascetic' or, more probably, like -šarman 'refuge, delight', which often forms the last element of a brahmin's name (eg the common Visnu-šarman)- the S/Gk correspondence š/k being frequent, as in šrad-lkrad- and šruta/kluto- . VI) Three deities : 1 . Artemis : Most of our information about Artemis comes from later sources. The archaic texts and iconography give little information. Earlier (in III, 5) I suggested this goddess may be connected with the Dawngoddess Usas after citing the incident where she and her brother flee from the battlefield. In the two Homeric Hymns to Artemis (Loeb 434-5 and 452-3), Artemis has certain traits that cannot be directly related to Usas, eg hunting with hounds and "destroying the race of wild beasts." Other features can be related to Usas, even Artemis's chief aspect as Moongoddess can be envisaged to derive from Dawn, elder sister of Night; then she delights in arrow-shooting, she causes an outcry among beasts and trembling on land and sea, and loves music, singing and dancing. In RV VI, 64, 3 Usas is likened to a heroic archer / thrower ástã and a swift warrior vólhã against foes and darkness. She is not a huntress at all, but sets birds and beasts astir early (1, 49, 3; IV, 51, 5), while in the Mycenaean documents "Artemis ( atimite [Dat.], atemito [Gen.]) was not obviously associated with animals" (Dietrich 1974 : 172, n 218). She shares some features with the Artemis of the two Homeric Hymns : sister of Bhaga (z Gk Phoibos) in RV I, 123, 5, golden-hued, she has a glittering chariot (III, 61 , 2), is likened to a dancer (I, 92, 4) and sings (I, 113,4; 123, 5). In RV IV, 28, 2 and 30, 4 Indra attacks the Dawn and the Sun and crushes their chariot and they flee : this is faintly reminiscent of Apollo and Artemis fleeing from the battlefield, one compelled by Poseidon and the other by Hera, and with them Leto compelled by Hermes (//, 15, 435-503). One might even link the name Artemis with the Mitanni theophoric names Artatama and Artamanya (Puhvel 1989 : 99) and many Iranian names and nouns with arta- as their first element. This initial component arta- is connected with Vedic rta 'cosmic order', which Usas is repeatedly said to follow. (Cf V rj- z Gk are-</page><page sequence="20">20 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) es and V rs - z Gk ars-ën ; the -r- was lost in Men Atimi- ?) Admittedly, these are very tenuous threads. 2. Apollo. In section IV, 3 above, we noted certain close parallels between Apollo and Indra. Since the two names are so very different it would be difficult to identify him with Indra. On the other hand, Zeus bears a name that is cognate with V dyaus but, unlike Dyaus, he is a very active king of heaven sharing common features with Varuna and Indra. It is therefore worth noting that Apollo has a few more affinities with Indra.9 Apollo's birth in the Homeric Hymn To Apollo (11 1 15-9) resembles very much the account(s) of Indra 's birth in the Rgveda. The presence of Eileithyia, goddess of child birth, in the Greek hymn may be of NE derivation, since this motif is not present in the Rgveda' but it could also come from Greek poetic inspiration since a midwife's presence at a difficult birth is not an unnatural phenomenon anywhere. Like Leto, Indra 's mother had a difficult deliverance: she carried the child in her womb for 1000 months and he came out from her side ( RV IV, 18, 1-4). Then, as soon as born, Indra illuminated the sky (III, 44, 4) as Apollo leapt into the light (119). Indra displayed his warrior's prowess at once (III, 51,8), drank the divine Soma, put on his garment and filled with his presence the two world-halves (IV, 18, 3-5) - as Apollo got washed and clothed, was given nectar and ambrosia, then burst out of his golden bands, asked for a bow and lyre and strode forth, and the whole island of Delos blossomed with gold (120-35). The amazement of the goddesses at Apollo's swift emergence and development (11 1 19, 135) and the gods' alarm as he enters into the palace of Zeus (11 2-3) are paralleled by the Vedic description that Heaven and Earth trembled in awe at Indra 's coming forth (1,61,14). The details are not absolutely exact equivalents , but then again they are not found in the description of any other deity in Greek, Near Eastern or Vedic texts. 3. Aphrodite. Not only modern scholars, but ancient writers like Herodotus (1, 105 &amp; 1 3 1 ) see the origin of this Greek goddess in the Near East and (modern scholars) connect her with Sumerian Inanna, who became 9 Dr Bhattacharji connects Apollo with Vivasvat (p 243) and Krsna (p 303) and Gk Python with S Pütanä (p 304) whereas she had linked Gk Puthon (= Python) with Budhnya (p 1 50) ! She does at least mention briefly the parallel of Apollo and Indra slaying the dragon-serpent (P 259).</page><page sequence="21">Kazanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 21 Akkadian Ishtar, Semitic Ashtorith and Astarte. However, there are enough indications to show that in part Aphrodite derives from a goddess of the Vedic tradition. First let us examine her parentage. a) Most of us think of Aphrodite as born out of sea-foam while some may know that she rose from Ouranos's severed genitals that floated on the seafoam (Hesiod's Theogony, 188 ff). However, in Iliad 5, 369ff, Aphrodite's mother is Dione who lives on Olympus, and her father Zeus; in 20, 105, Apollo tells Aeneas, son of Trojan king Priam, that his mother Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus. This means that the goddess had a normal birth born of a female, divine or mortal, with whom Zeus had coupled - and not out of Ouranos's bloodied genitals in the seafoam long before Zeus came into existence. Dione does not appear anywhere else in Homer's epics, but she is attested in the cult of Zeus at Dodona. (Kerényi 1982 : 68; Burkert 1992 : 98 and n 8), while the Mycenaeans had goddess Diwija, who may be related. Furthermore, Dione is mentioned by name alone in a long list of deities (Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Athena, Leto, et al) in Theogony 1 7 , and again in 353 as one of the Õkeaninai 'Ocean's daughter's - but it is not clear if it is one and the same Dione. She is also mentioned as one of the "best" goddesses present at Apollo's birth together with Rhea and others except Hera ( Hymn to Apollo, 92-5). Now, in the context of all these high deities, Dione could hardly be the humbler Oceanid, unless she bore Aphrodite to Zeus. So either there are two Diones, one on Olympus and the other in ocean, or the Oceanid, having born Aphrodite to Zeus, was, like Leto, taken up to Olympus by him - though Homer and Hesiod say nothing about this! Be that as it may, Hesiod gives a totally different account for Aphrodite's birth. Clearly we have two different versions of the goddess's origin. Here the Rgveda is of no help. Apart from Dawngoddess Usas and Rivergoddess Sarasvati who are endowed with distinct features, no other female deity appears in the hymns having individual personality. Sky god Dyaus, who in the context of our discussion may be regarded as the equivalent of Zeus, has no consort and is invariably mentioned with Mothergoddess Earth, Prthivl or Ksamã or Bhiimi ; Indra has a consort Indrãni and Varuna Varunãnl and</page><page sequence="22">22 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) Rudra (in the Sütras) Rudrãní. We find the (secondary, marginal) cognates diva/divan 'sky, day' and divya 'divine' but no *divânï. Keith wrote, "the pale figure of Dione, beside Zeus, suggests that the process which produced Indrãnl and her fellows was already working in the Indo-European period" (I, 61). So Dione looks like an inherited form but it is most probably a much later Greek production. Whether it was coined by the poet(s) of the Iliad, as Burkert seems to think (B 97-8), or is of a much earlier date, it is not easy to decide on the available evidence, as for the Mycenaean Diwija, this clearly z S divija 'skyborn' or divya 'divine, celestial'. b) According to Burkert, the name Aphrodite may be a "Greek form of Western Semitic Ashtorith, who in turn is identical with Ishtar" (B, 98 and n 7). However, if we forget about the Aphrodite-Adonis affair which is parallel to Ishtar and Dumuzi / Tammuz and is of late report, there is very little left to connect the two goddessess' character and deeds. Here, I ignore the evidence of Paphos and architecture (Farnell, 1896 : II, 618), of Hermaphrodites, ornaments, votive offerings, figurines and the like, many of which are doubtful, as presented by Burkert (1977 : 238ff) : all these (particularly , repulsive figurines of a naked goddess with a bird face) have little bearing on the character we see in the Iliad, Theogony and the Homeric Hymns ( Odyssey 8 being a different matter : see c below). To being with, we face serious difficulties with the derivation of Aphrodite's name, whichever way we look at it. Be that as it may, the name does reflect the mythologem of her birth out of sea-foam in Theogony 178-97. Even if we accept a putative derivation from the Near East, and Aphrodite's birth from Zeus-Dione (be it another borrowing), we still have to account for her rise from sea-foam in Hesiod. Ishtar has to all appearances a normal birth from her parents Anu and Antu. In addition, unlike Aphrodite, Ishtar is passionate and explosive wherever she appears ( Gilgamesh VI; The Descent of Ishtar...; Erra and Ishun: MM 77, 80-1; 155 ff; 305). Goddess of sexual love, storms and war, she had "countless lovers" and an "ability to engage in incessant sexual intercourse with numerous men without tiring ... Inanna [Sumerian goddess = Akkadian Ishtar]</page><page sequence="23">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 23 was known for her ambition and cruelty" (Dunstan 1998 : 59; Penglase 1994 : 19). Aphrodite has no such traits. It is claimed that she may be armed and can bestow victory (Burkert, 1977 : 238 n 8) but we see nothing of this in Homer and Hesiod. Her coercion of Helen to go to Paris after his defeat by Menelaus (II 3, 380-420) is of little significance when set beside Inanna : "You are known by your destruction of rebel-lands , / . . . by your massacring (their people) , / ... by your devouring (their) dead like a dog" wrote Enheduanna in her hymn to that goddess (Pritchard, 1975 : 131). No, Aphrodite is not a furchtbare Göttin, a terrible goddess, as Burkert writes (1977 : 240; and nothing more is added by Penglase in 1994 : 162ff). c) The archaic texts present Aphrodite in two different versions. In the Iliad (5, 31 Iff) Aphrodite has had her son Aeneas with Anchises (under Zeus's influence, in the long Hymn to Aphrodite ) and Hephaistos is married to Charis, who is well disposed towards Thetis, mother of Achilles (II 18, 368-409), and therefore cannot be Aphrodite under another name, as Kerényi suggests (1982 : 72), since the latter is pro-Trojan. In Theogony 945 Hephaistos marries Aglaea, the youngest Charis (thus agreeing with Iliad), while Aphrodite bears to Ares two sons, Phobos 'fear' and Deimos 'terror' and a daughter, Harmony (Theog 933 ff). However, in Odyssey 8, 276-381 , she is married to Hephaistos but gives herself to Ares and, in a scene that is both burlesque and soft pornography, is caught in the act. (Clearly, the Homer who wrote the Odyssey scene is either a different or a very forgetful one.) This incident is probably the beginning of her reputed promiscuity and the later affairs with Hermes, Dionysos and Adonis (GM 1, 68ff), in contrast to the timid, conciliatory and rather chaste figure in the other texts. Although she is the goddess of beauty and her function is to stir love and passion in gods and in mortals bringing about union (Theog 203; in II 5, 429 'marrigage' èrga gámoio) by using her magic girdle, she does this not for herself but for others. She is docile and not very acute : Hera dupes her very easily in borrowing her magic girdle (II 14, 170-214). The sexuality that Burkert ascribes to her is also not borne out by the very early texts (except Odyssey 8). It may be that we have two different aspects of one goddess, but the details of her birth and her marriage suggest two (or more) distinct</page><page sequence="24">24 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) figures. The two versions contain confused elements and overlap : they furnish the origin of the later Ourania 'Celestial' Aphrodite (Herodotos I, 105; Plato Symposium 180D) as distinct from the Pandemos 'Vulgar' (Burkert 1977 : 242 and n 34). d) In origin, Aphrodite has some affinities with an Indie goddess. This is not Usas, the Dawn, as many scholars have speculated. D. D. Boedeker argued for Aphrodite's origin in the PIE (really Vedic) Dawn-goddess; seeking support in philology, she examined earlier attempts at the derivation of the name and finally settled for S abhra 'rain, cloud, sky' and the PIE * ¿feí-'shine' (1974 : 7-12). Following a different route, P Friedrich also arrived at the PIE Dawn-goddess (1978 : 22-53) and mentioned briefly Beodeker's work (p 44). Such an origin is not impossible, of course; the Greeks formed Dione (z S Ví/i'v &gt; dyaus 'sky' etc : see a, above) as the Romans formed Venus (z S Vvím 'love, gain' &gt; vanas 'beauty, desire'). The Greeks could have formed the name 'Aphrodite from a compound, though not abhra and *dei but perhaps abhra- and -udita (*abhroditã is not attested in Sanskrit) in the sense 'risen from sky-water' (or even abhra- and - aditi 'the boundless mothergoddess of sky waters ' which * abhrãditi also is not attested). Nonetheless, it is very difficult to see whjit Aphrodite has in common with Usas. Nor is it necessary to speculate about innovation and development of the Usas figure, beause there is another Vedic goddess that has several affinities with Aphrodite . This is Šri/Laksmí - and it could be argued , of course , that this goddess was in some earlier phase an aspect of Usas, who is daughter of Dyaus ( RV 1, 48, 1). In the Vedic tradition we find goddess Sri 'goddess of beauty and abundance'. (The name appears perhaps in Gk Kër/Kar 'goddess of doom' and Roman C er-ěs 'goddess of agriculture'.) In the Rgveda and Atharvaveda the noun means simply 'beauty, splendour, glory, prosperity' and the like, but it may have a tinge of divinity in RV I, 85, 2 and AV VI, 73, 1 . As a fully recognized goddess she appears in Šatapatha Brãhmanã XI, 4, 3 and in the later iconography she is often seated on a lotus, thus being connected with the (later) appellation Padmã 'She of the lotus'; of course the lotus floats on waters. We do not hear of her origin until the epics where she is identified with Laksmî as consort of Visnu. Here Šrf is said to rise</page><page sequence="25">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 25 from the (butter-) foam of the (milk-) ocean when gods and demons cooperated to obtain amrta 'the elixir of immortality ' (MB I, 16; with important variants Ra 1, 45) : as the ocean was churned and churned, first rose out of it the Sun, then the Moon and then Šri clothed in white. (Other wonders rose also and eventually Dhan van tari, the gods' physician, holding a gourd with amrta). Strangely, West is unaware of this myth (1997 : 4-5, where the MB is discussed, and pp 222-6, where a Maori myth is mentioned on the separation of earth and sky).10 Apart from her birth, Šrí has another affinity with the Greek goddess in that as Laksmi she is consort of Visnu. As we saw, in Theogony Aphrodite is associated with Ares, the Wargod. Now, in action Ares is a rather pitiable god of war. Zeus, his father, is utterly contemptuous of him (// 5, 765-6), Athena invariably defeats him (// 21, 40), he gets wounded by Diomedes, with Athena's help (II 5, 858), and in fact he never wins a fight (GM I, 73-4); nonetheless, he is the Wargod and Aphrodite bears his children. Not of major importance in the RV, Visnu 'the active, expansive one' displays a martial streak in aiding Indra slay Vrtra and himself slaying a mighty boar (1,61,7; VIII, 77, 10). He becomes a high god in the Brãhmanas (ŠB XIV, 1 , 1 , Iff; AB V, 1, Iff) and in the epics he is incarnated in the warrior caste of ksatriyas, as the mighty and wise Krsna of the Mahãbhãrata and as prince Räma, the incomparable warrior of the Rãmãyana. Visnu's consort Laksmi is the goddess of Good Fortune and as Sita, Rama's wife, she bears two sons (but of opposite character to Ares's sons). The noun laksmi initially means 'sign' (RV, X, 71 , 2) as also given in Nirukta IV, 10. It acquires the meaning 'good sign' punyã laksmi in the Atharvaveda as also 'prosperity, good fortune', and in the later texts becomes the name of the goddess of Good io The critical ed of the Mahãbhãrata (Poona 1970, BORI, Bk, I, ch 16) and JAB van Buitenen in his translation ( 1980, Univ of chicago Press, vol 1 , pp 74-442 n 30) accept Šri 's rise as belonging to teh mainstream story of the epic. The emergence of Idã from the milk-offerings poured by Manu onto the waters {ŠB 1, 8, 1-11) may be related to Šri/LaksmI also, though this is not certain.</page><page sequence="26">26 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) Fortune. (In fact both Sri and Laksmi are juxtaposed as "wives" of Primordial Man, Purusa, in the (White) Yajur-Veda XXXI, 22.) In this there is an additional affinity with Aphrodite, who was at Athens regarded as the eldest of the three Fates (Pausanias, I, 19, 2; X, 24, 4; GM I, 72). Kerényi mentions also Aphrodite's related aspect as Genetullis 'caring over child- birth' which places her close to Hekáte, another Fate-figure (1982 ; 67). Aphrodite's girdle provides yet another link. In the Vedic tradition, women as compared with men are always the inferior part of the sacrificial rite and impure and must wear a girdle (SB I, 3, 1, 12). It is not impossible that this girdle became in course of time a means for inciting passion. e) In conclusion, we have at least two figures of Aphrodite, one with a birth from Zeus-Dione and the other from the genitals of Ouranos in the sea-foam. The two have contradictory aspects and don't fuse satisfactorily. We find contradiction not only between the figure in the Homeric epics and that in Hesiod's Theogony, but also between the figure in the Iliad and that in the Odyssey. Penglase writes that "The birth myth [of Aphrodite] has some features which parallel those found with Ishtar in her myths" (p 165); but after giving an account of Aphrodite's birth in Theogony, he states "this myth has no parallels of narrative to those myths which survive about the Mesopotamian goddess" (p 166). The phrase "which survive" suggests that there have been a myth of Ishtar rising from the sea. The suggestion is legitimate, of course, but it ignores the fundamental and irreconcilable dichotomy in Aphrodite, if taken as a unitary figure. The two figures or the two births of the Greek goddess suggest two different sources. The foam-born deity seems to be of IE descent while the other one, the figure in the Odyssey and later myths, comes from the Near East. This view alone would accommodate all the relevant elements in the myths and cult of Aphrodite and the testimonies of Herodotus (1, 105; 1, 131) and of Pausanias (I, 14, 7) about her origin in the Near East.</page><page sequence="27">Kazanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 27 VII) Miscellany In this section I examine some other elements in the Greek culture. 1 ) Some Historical considerations According to S. Kak (2000) art-experts A. D. Napier, H. Zimmer, think that the Gorgo representations in Greece owe much to Indie art. This is plausible, but such iconography would not be part of the IE heritage the Greeks brought with them. Any similarities would be due to contacts between Greeks and Indians after the 9th century and mainly due to the presence of Indians in the Persian armies that invaded Greek areas in the 6th (in Ionia in the eastern Aegean) and early 5th centuries (mainland Greece). From the time of the IE dispersal in the 4th or 3rd millennium, no contact of great significance could have taken place between Greeks and Indians before Alexander's penetration into Bactria. There are reports by writers of the Hellenistic and Roman periods that Greeks had visited India in much earlier times; Plutarch in his Lives... reports that legendary Lycurgus of Sparta visited India (. Lycurgus , 6). In fact Plutarch, Diodoros Sikeliotes (known as Siculu) and Diogenes Laertius manage between them to send just about every Greek sage into the East (including Pythagoras and Democritus, but notably not Socrates and Aristotle). Even if such journeys did take place, these sages are more likely to have brought back with them philosophical or scientific ideas rather than iconographie. It is much more likely that iconographie material would have reached Greece through conscripted soldiers in the Persian armies or through merchants.11 1 1 Possible contacts between Greece and India from most ancient to Roman times have been examined extensively by J W Sedlař (1980). For this particular period see p 79. Prof S Kak writes : 'According to Lomperis (1984), "Plato, throught the Pythagoreans and also the Orphies, was subjected to the influence of Hindu thought but he may not have been aware of it as coming from India" ' (Kak, 2000) . I have not read Lomperis; his view sounds conjectural, given the insufficiency of early Greek sources, but, of course, it is possible. Later in the same article Kak cites Zimmer (1946) and Napier (1986, 1992) who argue that the Gorgon and the Cyclops have elements deriving from India; this too has some plausibility. He also cites Krishna (1980) who thinks the name of the mycenaean city Tiryns "is the same as that of the most powerful Indian sea-faring people called the Tirayans." This sounds utterly improbable. Tiryna' ( tirun-th-os , genitive singular, with stem tirun- th-) cannot philologically be a cognate with, or derivative of, 'Ti ray an' : Greek upsilon [m] cannot correspond to, or derive from, Sanskrti [aya] (cf Greek kiõ 'move, go', õkeanos 'ocean' and treis 'three' and Sanskrit cognates cay-a.ášayana and tray as where the correspondence is strictly of palatal phonemes); then, we would have to account for the (Continued on the next page)</page><page sequence="28">28 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ; Unfortunately there is very little evidence available for this subject; consequently all discussions must entail much conjecture. In any case, the period concerned here is post- Archaic. 2. Lamia and Gorgon. Burkert is most probably correct in seeing borrowings of iconographie representations of the Lamia and Gorgo monsters from NE sources (1992 : 82-7) . The reproductions he presents ( 1 992; also 1 987 : 30-33) are convincing and are matched by similar reproductions in Dalley (1998 : 89, 90, 99, 102). Even archaeologists who minimize the total effect of NE influences on archaic Greek arts and crafts accept that there was imitation of and inspiration from NE forms (eg Starr 1962 : 213 ff; Snodgrass 1971 : 417 &amp; 1980 : 64-7). However, we must remember that often artists and craftsmen in one culture imitate forms of another culture in order to improve their own and express better their own ideas. These demonesses / monsters that snatch up children (mainly Lamia) and eat up people may have belonged to the IE side of the Greek culture. Such monsters are found in most cultures. Thus in RV IV, 18, 8 occurs - this once only! - kusavä : according to Say ana she is demonness 'Evil-birth' who swallows children; according to some modern scholars she is a river who swallowed Indra (O' Flaherty 198 1 : 142 and n 14). Nothing more is known about kusavã. However the Dharmasãstra Sütras do refer to demons snatching children (eg Päraskara's Grhyasütra I, 12, 4). Here a small parenthesis may not be out of place. In the Rigvedic mythology anthropomorphism is down to a minimum and so is theriomorphism (mainly but not exclusively in the case of demons) : human or animal features (Continued from p. 27) consonant theta. If we assumed that this most unlikely linguistic event took place , we would have to suppse then that a band of Indian seafarers before the 17th cent BCE somehow managed to sail into the Mediterranean, got into the gulf of Argolis in the Peloponnese, landed there, travelled inland and somehow established a city or managed to give their own name to an existing community, while at that time, or afterwards, the advancing Greeks were setting up their own cities at Mycenae, Pylos and elsewhere. This I find incredible. Relevant titles from Kak's bibliography : Krishna N 1980.

Thus scholars at different periods interpreted these deities and demons as forces of nature (Max Müller, Oldenberg, Hillebrandt, Macdonell), as psychosomatic or spiritual forces with man (Shri Aurobindo, 1982; Frawley 1982 &amp; 1992), as forces of fertility and sexuality (O'Flaherty in almost all her publications), as forces in Thermonuclear Physics (Rajaram 1999) and so on. How one interprets the RV hymns obviously depends on what circulates in one's mind at the time. 3. The Greek legend of the Seven against Thebes (in the drama of Aeschylus, c 467, which may carry echoes of events from the Mycenaean era) has certain similarities with (and many differences from) the NE myth of the terrible Seven (Sebbiti) who ride with Wargod Erra {MM 282ff). Burkert thinks the Assyrian legend may have influenced the Greek one even if the latter were originally an historical event (B 107-1 14). In support of the NE influence are adduced the Seven sages and the seven-headed Hydra (B, 1 14). Although it is not stated explicity, it may be that these evil Seven are an aspect of the Seven Sages or original Craftsmen {MM 291, 294) who, after civilizing mankind before the flood, were banished back to the Underworld of Apsu {MM 327-8). In the Veda there is no (allusion to a) legend of Seven evil-ones attacking the world or a city - only the 10 against king Sudãs (III, 5, above). The only approximate motif is Indra 's destruction of Seven Forts of a tribe 'of insulting speech' mrdhravãc, whom Keith calls (1989 : 234) Dãsas, a common name for demons, in RV I, 174, 2; but no more is said of this. There are many allusions to the Seven Sages sapta-rsi (eg RV IV, 42, 8) and to monstrous Visvarüpa who is called 'three-headed' and 'seven-raveď (II, 11,19; X, 8,8). In later texts there appear seven-headed monsters also. However, the most likely candidates, if at all, are the Seven Maruts of RV VIII, 28, 5, who are sometimes presented as 7 bands of 7 {RV V, 52, 17), and are companions of Indra. The Vedic threads are admittedly very slender but no more than the Akkadian ones. Many strange transmutations of motifs are observed in oral transmission. Thus Indra, the mighty divine hero of the IndoAryans is but a minor fiend in the Iranian Avesta ; he appears as Inar(a) in Hittite myths and as goddess Andaría (or Andrasta) among the Celts of Gaul and Britain. Again, Parjanya, a Vedic minor god of rain, is Perenu (and variants) in Slavonic</page><page sequence="30">30 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) mythology, a great Wargod (who, like Indra, killed a serpent to release cattle and waters) or the Lord of the universe; in the early Baltic texts he is a mere name Perkunas in a list of gods and later the oracular Thundergod; among the Norsemen he appears as male Fjorgyn and female Fjorgynn, mother of Thor. Similarly azugallatu, the title of the Babylonian goddess of healing , Gula, becomes in Greek masculine asgelatas and perhaps Asklëpios (B 75-9). So it would not be all that incredible if the seven godly Maruts appear in Greece as seven evil attackers and the seven forts as the seven-gated fort of Thebes - possibly with NE influences. 4. Plato devotes the whole of his Republic to show that a society would really prosper only if it were governed by wise men or philosopher kings; he reiterates this theme in his Laws 71 OB. This theme goes back to archaic texts where we read that the land and the people thrive under the good government of a faultless king ( Odyssey 19, 106-13) or that peace and happiness prevail where just men rule (Hesiod's Works and Days 216-37). This view sounds so superbly reasonable that it comes as no surprise to find it expressed in other distant cultures, like the Chinese (eg Chuang Tzu in Giles 1980 : 30, 76-7, 109-12), which enquired with sagacity into the nature of things. This theme may have been developed indigenously by the Greeks. On the other hand, it is adequately presented also in the Veda. The bare principles of kingship (its inviolability, the defence of Law and of the people) and the structured social classess are enunciated in the Brãhmanas (eg SB V, 1 , 5, 14; V, 4, 4, 7ff; etc). In these texts there are several stories of righteous kings whose realm prospered. The best example is perhaps that of Ašvapati Kaikeya in whose kingdom "there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without the sacrificial fire, no ignorant person, no adulterer or courtesan" because he himself "had realized the Universal Self" (C/i Up V, 2, 4-6). 5. The substitution of sacrificial victims is another practice in archaic Greece that has parallels in the Veda. This substitution in Greece for various reasons in different circumstances, including pestilence, is examined extensively by D Hughes (1991 : 79ff). The practice is well attested in the Veda too. In the Vedic texts this takes many forms and is done in a variety of circumstances (Keith, I, 268 : "the victim is really offered as a ransom for oneself"). The best known case is that of young Šunahšepa whose release is mentioned in RV I, 24, 12-3 and whose entire predicament is narrated in Aitar ey a Brahmano VIII, 13ff : an avaricious brahmin sells his</page><page sequence="31">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 31 son. Šunahšepa to king Harišcandra, who is suffering from dropsy having avoided to sacrifice his own son to Varuna as he had promised to do; the lad takes the place of the king's son and is tied to the post but prays to the gods and they release him. The theory of substitution is stated in Šatapatha Brahmano I, 2, 3ff and in Aitareya Brãhmana II, 8. Since this practice is found also "in the provision of the old Law of the Twelve Tables in Rome where a human being is substituted by a Ram" (B, 74), we can safely assume that the practice has its root in the IE tradition. 6. The castration of Ouranos by Kronos in Hesiod's Theogony (11 178ff) is a most curious mythological motif. Since the discovery of the Hittite texts Kingship in Heaven and The Myth of Ullikummi, orientalists and classicists invariably cite the NE parallel of Kumarbi castrating Anu as the origin for Kronos castrating Ouranos in Hesiod.12 No classicist ever mentions in this connection any affinities with the Vedic mythologem of Indra 's slaying the dragon Vrtra (RV 1, 32); neither do comparati vists, as far as I know, mention any relation, albeit hypothetical. The RV hymn I, 32 is one of many about Indra and his heroic deeds and is devoted wholly to Indra's fighting and slaying Vrtra. The most relevant stanza is 7 : vrsnó vádhrih pratimãnam búbhüsan purutrá vrtró asayad výastah. The more recent translations I have seen by W O' Flaherty (1975 : 75; 1981 : 150) and by J Puhvel (1989 : 52) are misleading in presenting the contrast between a "steer" (ie Vrtra, a castrated young ox) and a "mighty bull" (i.e. Indra). I don't see why vadhri should be taken only as a metaphor; in RV X, 69, 10 the attestation of vadhryašváh 'the gelded horse' or "one whose horse is gelded' indicates that vadhri does not on its own automatically mean a castrated anomal. A more correct translation would read, "Emasculated, Vrtra lay with limbs dissevered / scattered in many places - he who strove to be the equal of the mighty one." In other RV hymns we read that Vrtra was struck in his 'vital part' (= márma : I, 16, 6; III, 32, 4; etc) and then hacked to pieces (I, 16, 12; VIII, 6, 13). Vrtra had genitals since there was a brood of Vitras and he was the eldes or foremost. So he got castrated in the course of fighting: his genitals were among the other parts of his body strewn here and there. And the next stanza (8) says that these scattered parts got 12 See Penglase (1997 : 185-6) for full Bibliogaphy.</page><page sequence="32">32 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) submerged in billowing waters. When, moreover, we learn that Indra himself gets emasculated by a curse from sage Gautama after he, in the sage's form , went to bed with his wife Ahalyã (Ra , 1 , 47-8 , developing the motif from SB III, 3,4, 18 &amp; XII, 7, 1 , lOff), then we can with good reason suspect that the castration of Ouranos may well be an inherited motif reshaped and retold by Hesiod, perhaps under NE influences. There is another point of resemblance in this incident that should be taken into account. Stanza 4 of the RV hymn says that when Indra killed the dragon "at that moment [he, Indra] brought forth the Sun, Heaven and Dawn"; in RV I, 51, 4 again at the killing of Vrtra Indra raises the Sun in the sky. Here then we see cosmogonie action beyond the release of the imprisoned waters. But the cosmogony here is quite different from the théogonie results of Ouranos 's castration. Here the Sun, Heaven, Dawn and Waters already exist and are covered up or wholly encompassed by Vrtra who is himself encompassed by darkness (RV X, 1 13, 6); Indra merely brings them forth again. The Hesiodic narrative has different proliferations : Ouranos disappears completely from the scene thereafter and Kronos (born wily, most terrible and hating his father) ascends the heavenly throne; from the blood of Ouranos on earth emerge the Erinyes (the terrible instruments of divine punishment), giants and nymphs, while in the sea rises the goddess of beauty and love, Aphrodite. These complications seem to relate to the Vedic sacrifice of Purusa (= primordial Man) by the gods and its cosmogonie result (RV X, 90); in the Scandinavian myth the gods Odin, Vili and Ve dismember the giant Ymir (z V Y ama) again with cosmogonie results; castration is not involved in either - nor in the cosmogonie dismemberment of Tiamat by Marduk in the Mesopotamian Epic of Creation (MM 256-7). Even stranger seems the Hurrian / Hittite myth where Kumarbi, skygod Anu's son, bites off and swallows his father's genitals, becomes pregnant (!) and begets three gods, one of them being the Weathergod who overthrows in turn Kumarbi. I suspect the Greek and NE myths are both developments of the PIE motifs as preserved in the Vedic tradition. The Hittites afterall were IE and must have brought with them some inherited material, even though this underwent, much more than the Greek IE heritage, "heavy substratal exposure and adstratal influence... vertical diffusion from the local past and lateral diffusion from the contemporary vicinity", as Puhvel says of the Greeks (1989 : 22). The Kassites again were IE or had absorbed strong IE influences since many of their names and some of their gods</page><page sequence="33">Kazanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 33 were of Indo Aryan descent13 : under their rule in Babylonia, especially under Agum II (early 1 6th century) , there was "a surge of literary invention , collection and recording" (MM 41, 229); Heidel 1965 : 13-4; Roux 1992 : 251). 7. Many other motifs and themes common to the mythologies of archaic Greece and Vedic India could be mentioned but most of them have been indicated and discussed by other scholars (eg Keith, Bhattacharji , Arora, Puhvel et al). In this study I have examined aspects that have not been indicated or adequately treated so far and especially aspects of literature , religion and magic (sections III, IV, V and VII). No doubt there are others. VIII) Conclusions One first conclusion concerns the archaic Greek culture itself. It has a distinct strand of IE tradition. This would not have been pure since the Greeks must have assimilated other elements from peoples they met on their way to the shores of the Aegean. A second strand is the indigenous culture the immigrants met when they arrived in Greece : this too would have been composite, consisting of the mainland culture, the Minoan on Crete and the Cycladic (and other islands of the Aegean). A fourth strand, also composite, came from the Near East. These four got interwoven and produced the miracle of classical Greece. Puhvel thought the Greek tradition was not a conservative repository of IE heritage 1989 : 22). This is true, of course, but only if one compares the Greek culture with the Vedic; otherwise the Greeks seem to have preserved much more than any other European tradition and the Anatolian one. The fact that the Greek language is centum while Vedic is šatam (or satdm) suffices to show that the Greeks and the IndoAryans were not close companions for any length of time to the exclusion of the other IE branches (ie Celts and Slavs, for example). Therefore the Greek correspondences or parallels with Vedic elements or practices cannot be coincidental (though some of them may be due to independent development) : they derive from a common soure, the PIE culture. Another motif common to NE mythologies, Greek theogony and the Veda, is the incestuous relationship of many deities. In the peoples of the Near 13 Leaving out uncertain or disputed names, we find some names, or an element in compound names, that are indubitably Indo-Aryan : - indaš &lt; S Indra-, -bugaš &lt; S Bhaga' - Maruttaš &lt; S Marutas (plural); -Šuriaš &lt; S Sürya ; etc. All are taken from J A Brinkman's chronology and lists of Kings in A L Oppenheim (1977 : 338).</page><page sequence="34">34 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) East this relationship is also a fact of life, at least among royal families. This is not so in the archaic Greek and Vedic cultures : incest is condemned in both, as is evident in the Oedipus legend (mother-son relation) and the Yama-Yami dialogue in RV X, 10 (sister wants to mate with brother but he resists). The explanation I would offer is that the Vedic culture knew that the gods were not real and did not exist as autogenous and autonomous entities. Karel Werner argued convincingly that the Rgveda contains two concurrent beliefs : one in polytheism with many individual gods, and one in monotheism (1989). Indeed the Creation Hymn RV X, 129 presents a most profound view of the primal Unity as the origin of all divine, cosmic and human phenomena. Scholars somewhat grudgingly conceded to the ancient Indian seers this view placing it as a late development of Vedic speculative thought (eg Keith, 11,446). Werner (acknowledging the work of R Otto and others) showed that this was not so, but that monotheism is in the RV as old as polytheism. He should have utilized at least four more hymns. Two, which may be late (1, 164, 6 and X, 1 14, 5), say that poets speak of It, being One, in many ways - naming. It Agni, Yama, Indra etc. The other two belong to the Family Books and are probably very early : hymn VIII, 58, 2 says "It being One has variously (vi ) become this All (and Everything)"; then, the refrain of III, 55 states plainly "Single is the great god-power ( asuratva ) of the gods." Since the deities were representations of cosmic forces and manifestations of the One, then obviously it would not matter if they united and generated other deities just as cosmic forces mingle and generate new phenomena. In social life incest was not practised in ancient India, nor among the other IE branches. The idea of a primordial Unity as the originative principle of all cosmic phenomena is absent in the Greek (and other IE) and NE mythologies, though in Greece some three centuries of philosophical enquiry into the nature of things led eventually to formulations of that Unity (by Parmenides, Melissos of Samos and Plato). The Greeks retained the incestuous relationships relationship among the gods but, probably because of their IE heritage, not in their ordinary life. So did the IndoAryans. The odd thing about the Greeks is that while their Philosophy found that primordial Unity, their religion continued with its polytheism. Of course, the same thing prevailed much earlier in ancient India. Obviously the One Primal Source of all, being Itself unmanifest, cannot so readily become an object of Worship as other deities. The second conclusion concerns the Vedic culture. Without it much in the ancient European cultures would have remained unconnected and</page><page sequence="35">Razanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 35 unexplained - both in language and in religion or mythology. The legend of Greek Dioskouroi and Lithouanian Dievo Sunelai would not have been connected if it had not been for the Vedic Ašvins. The practice of sacrificial substitute (above VI, 5), to mention an example from religion, would be considered (as Burkert takes it in 1992 : 73-5) a result of borrowing or diffusion from the Near East to Greece and thence to Rome. Phiologists in the West, and no doubt many in India who follow western trends, place almost all IE branches on the same level in linguistic and broader cultural consideration. Thus O'Flaherty refers to "Indo-European attitudes" and "Indo-European cultures" in her examination of the IE myth of twins and horse-deities and begins with a discussion of the Celtic material and then the Vedic - and first the ritual of the horse-human copulation and then the myths (1980 : 15ff); at least Puhvel starts his comparative study with the Vedic tradition (1989). It is understandable that all cultures should be studied with the same zeal but not that all should be accorded the same status or importance. Why? First of all, it is obvious that some preserve only a very small amount of inherited forms while others have a very rich inheritance and the Vedic tradition seems to be the wealthiest of them all. Then the Vedic heritage, even by the most niggardly dating at c 1000 BC, is older by at least 300 years than the earliest Greek records (barring the scanty Mycenaean ones). There is no disagreement among scholars that "Vedic is a language whic in most respects is more archaic and less altered from original Indo-European than any other member of the family" (Burrow 1973 : 34, emphasis added). Here we can add some phiological considerations. Greek has huios for 'son' (z S sunu , Gmc sun -, SI synü , Tocharian A/B se! soy, A v hunu) and hus/ sus for 'sow (she-swine)' (z S sü- kara, Gmc su-lgu -, L sãs, Av hã). Curiously, in Greek (and in the other IE languages) the tow stems stand isolated without a root or other verb- and noun-cognates. Only Sanskrit provides a root (common for both 'son' and 'sow') with the dhãtu I sã (&gt; säte) 'beget' and cognates both in nouns and verb- formations. Again Gk thugatër 'daughter' stands rootless and isolated, as do its cognates in the other IE languages (Av dugddar , Gmc tochter , Lth duktë , etc); there are secondary , later formations eg Gk thugatrion, but only S duhitr , shows a connection with duh 'milk, derive' and other cognates. We observe the same situation with Gk meter 'mother' (z L mater , Gmc muoter , etc) or mus 'mouse' (L mãs Gms mãs/maus , etc) : here too only Sanskrit has mus 'steal' and other primary nominais and verbal formations. Another, somewhat different consideration concerns the IE names for 'sun' : all branches have cognates like S sãrya , Gk helios , L sol , Lth sáule etc, all masculine, except the Gmc sunn- (Old English sunne OHG sunna) which is femininie; yet here again Sanskrit ha fem sãryã 'sunmaiden' and thus provides a probable</page><page sequence="36">36 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) explanation for the difference. It is strange that, given all these simple facts, the Vedic culture is not given the higher status it deserves and it is a pity sanskritists acquiesce in this situation.14 An examination of archaic Greek cosmogonie material would reveal further parallels in the Vedic texts . Neither in the Mycenaean nor in the archaic Greek period do we find the concept of the Unity that is the originative principle of all creation. This is true, of course, of all other IE and NE mythologies - except the Judaic religion; even in Egypt, Atum (= the Complete One), who 'evolves' or 'becomes' (= kheper) out of the primeval Water Nun, is only a secondary power, having something prior to him. It is therefore correct to see in all these mythologies "matter created from the action of heat on water" and also "a multi-layered dualism that pervades Indo-European myth and religion" (Stone 1997 : 79). However, it is misleading to ascribe this view (as Stone does on the same page15) to the Vedic tradition as well, which, more clearly than any other ancient document, asserts the primordial Unity as the First Principle of all cosmogony. Such an examination would, however, require a separate study. The evidence of parallels between archaic Greece and India leads to a third conclusion - that there are connections betwen the Vedic tradition and NE cultures. In the course of our discussion we saw many similarities both in mythological motifs and ritual practices.16 Many of them could perhaps be 14 Some notable exceptions have argued for the seniority and importance of Sanskrit and the Vedic culture : eg L Dhar The Home of the Aryans 1930, Imperial Book Depot, Delhi; S S Misra The Aryan Problem 1992, Munshiram Manoharlal, Delhi; et al. I disregard here shrill Indian publications that rely on nationalist feeling rather than scholarly method and evidence. 15 Puhvel states the situation with care, making the right distinction : "Fire and ice/water were both present in Norse cosmology and eschatology alike. 'Fire in water' is a theme that recurs in Indo-Iranian, Irish and Roman lore, in a complex mythologem of clear Indo-European significance" (1989 : 277) 16 Many a scholar (eg West 1978 : 175-6, with bibliography) thinks that Indie legends like the 4 Yugas ( Manusmrti 1,81-6) and many others have a NE origin. M Eliade believes that the conception of seven or nine heavens found in Buddhism and earlier Brãhmanism "probably represents the influence of Babylonian cosmology" (1972 : 406) but adduces no evidence fot this and I can't help wondering why the statement is made at all. Arora, again, thinks that NE legends influenced Vedic texts (1981 : 183-4) and that Greek legends (Continued on the next page)</page><page sequence="37">Kazanas : Archaic Greece and the Veda 37 ascribed to independent coincidental growth, arising from observation of natural phenomena like sunrise, rain, storm and lightning, the night-sky, the repetition of seasons and so on. Such may be, to take Egyptian mythology , the separation of Earth and Sky by Shu, god of Ari and Light who corresponds to Indra in his aerial and solar aspects. That Hathor should be thought of in terms of a divine Cow of plenty, while the all-nourshing Cow of heaven is a very common motif in the Veda, would also fall in the same category; the same can be said of Earth appearing in the midst of Waters, a concept shared by both the Egyptian and Vedic people. This, however, cannot be said of the idea that the souls of heroes or noblemen after death go to heaven and join the sun or stars : this concept could not have arisen from observation, nor the concept of "the cosmic egg" in the Vedic lore ( mãrta-anda 'sprung from the dead egg' in RVX, 72, 8; hiranyagarbha 'golden germ' in X, 121, 1; division of egg in Ch Up III, 19, 1-4) and in the Egyptian Book of the Dead , spell 85 (also Coffin Texts , spell 223 : for both, see Faulkner). However this matter also would require a separate study. (Continued from p . 36) influenced the Indian epics and fables (177-82). The latter case is very probable if we take into account the settlement of Greeks into the northwestern regions of India after Alexander. The former case can be maintained only if we accept the "Aryan-immigration" theory and all it entails, a theory that has no basis whatever in fact (see n 5, above).</page><page sequence="38">38 Annals BORI , LXXXII ( 2001 ) Bibliography Greek texts in the original and in translation have appeared in many editions, as with Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.
