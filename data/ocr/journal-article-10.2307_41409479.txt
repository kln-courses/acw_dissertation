<plain_text><page sequence="1">Како сделан Акакий: Letter as Hero in "The Overcoat" KATHLEEN SCOLLINS Gogol scholarship of the past few decades, perhaps in response to nearly two centuries of ardent, yet irreconcilable readings, has tended to construe "The Overcoat," along with its hero Akakii Akakievich, as pure literary performance, devoid of definitive meaning. The inarticulate copy-clerk has been critically demoted to a "verbal formula," an "ink homunculus," and "little more than a verbal artifact."1 Charles Bernheimer reduces the hero to still finer verbal rubble, arguing that Akakii "actually becomes a text, a text, however, that can be deciphered not as a series of significant signs but only as a succession of discrete letters."2 This paper will pursue a very literal extension of this line of scholarly investigation, presenting Akakii as an individual alphabetic character. In this reading, Akakii's linguistic journey is reconsidered and literalized as an isolated letter's search for content, context and, ultimately, significance. The history of "The Overcoat" criticism may be summed up as one of form vs. content, with one camp arguing over the tale's meaning, the other over its means.3 This struggle is I am indebted to many friends and colleagues for their help with this article; in particular, I would like to thank David Bethea, Andrew Reynolds, Molly Peeney, Erik McDonald, and Brian Minier for their thoughtful readings, insightful suggestions, and encouragement.

These modern challengers to the conventional social critics - including Formalists like Eikhenbaum, Symbolists like Bely, Nabokov, and contemporary critics like Popkin - turn a spotlight on the signifier itself, rather than what is being signified. As William Mills Todd III points out, however, these two major critical trends are not necessarily at odds. In adherence to what Todd terms the Gogolian logic of "both ... and," we see that "some of the most rigorously social readings have managed to contribute important insights into its structure and style," just as "those who have challenged the sociological tradition have, no less paradoxically, begun to clear the way for socially and historically aware readings" (Todd, Fiction and Society in the Age of Pushkin: Ideology, Institutions, and Narrative [Cambridge, MA, 1986], 168-69). In keeping with his observation, while my reading may (quite literally) turn language into the tale's hero, this linguistic focus acts in service to a broader sociohistorical argument.

In the 1 70 years since the literary birth of Akakii Akakievich, much critical heat has been generated over the derivation of the character's extraordinary moniker. On one end of the critical spectrum, the Formalists follow Boris Eikhenbaum in relegating the name to the class of linguistic devices that comprise the story; in his view, Akakii Akakievich becomes merely "an original mimicry of articulation, a sound-gesture," devoid of any independent meaning.4 Other critics argue that, beyond providing acoustic material for the punning, playful narrator, the name Akakii "leads to deep layers of significance within the story."5 An intermediary line of scholarship sifts for meaning among the pun-rich phonetic material identified by the Formalists. Working along these critical lines, this study locates yet another layer of meaning in the name, taking its lead from the hero's special relationship with letters. Various scholarly readings have been advanced to explain the duplication of the word как at the heart of Akakii Akakievich: where L. Michael O'Toole hears "the anguished repetition of the existential question 'how?'" in the hero's name, Victor Brombert argues that как "embeds the principle of sameness in Akaky 's name, determining, it would seem, his single-minded, life-long activity of copying and implicit condemnation to sameness."6 In a similar vein, this article will suggest that the name Akakii derives, at least in part, from the old Slavic letter Kako (that is, "К"); I will argue that the significance of this root-word lies not only in its semantics, however, but also in its function as the name of the Cyrillic letter.7 As numerous scholars have observed, variations on the word как recur with unusual frequency throughout the text. Indeed, in the rough draft of "The Overcoat," the narrator himself calls attention to the pervasiveness of the letter К in his manuscript: "Конечно можно было, некоторым образом, избежать частого сближения буквы к, но обстоятельства были такого рода, что никак нельзя было этого сделать" (Of course it might have been possible, in some way, to avoid the constant convergences of the letter K, but circumstances were such that it was impossible to do this).8 If Akakii serves as a living embodiment of the letter Kako , then the narrator's self-conscious reference to the frequent coupling of Ks in his text may serve as a punning allusion to the repetition of two Kakos with every mention of Akakii Atóievich. Even in a text overrun by the letter K, the 4Boris Eikhenbaum et al., "The Structure of Gogol's 'The Overcoat,'" Russian Review 22 (October 1963): 386. 5David Sloane, "The Name as Phonetic Icon: A Reconsideration of Onomastic Significance in Gogol's 'The Overcoat,"' Slavic and East European Journal 35 (Winter 1991): 475. In his summary of critical responses to Akakii, Sloane notes that where psychoanalysts might sniff out the embedded children's word "kaka," religious readings of the work frame the copyist as a descendant of the sixth-century martyr St. Acacius (ibid., 473-74). 6L.

Until about 1900, each letter went by a similarly mnemonic title, inherited from the Church Slavonic: A was known as Az , or "I"; Б was Buki , or "Letters," and so on. 8See Eikhenbaum et al., "The Structure of Gogol's 'The Overcoat,"' 385; and Julia Alissandratos, "Filling in Some Holes in Gogol"s Not Wholly Unholy 'Overcoat,'" Slavonic and East European Review 68 (January 1990): 27.

The passage is constructed as if to draw the reader's attention specifically to the letter's centrality in the hero's name; in fact, with a slight change of emphasis, this final clause could loosely be translated as, "the name originated (proizoshlo) namely thus: Kak'" Read in this light, the sentence becomes a playful word-puzzle detailing the name's etymology. Why would Gogol have chosen a letter as the basis of his most famous onomastic creation? In addition to the semantics of the letter's official name ("like," "how"), the individual letter К can also function as a preposition, signifying one's movement toward something else, usually another person; like any preposition, however, k requires an object, a kto , in order to fully acquire its meaning: k komu (to whom). This relational meaning of K, as well as the preposition's utter meaninglessness out of context, suggest a journey from alienation and senselessness toward community and significance. In the absence of a surrounding context, however, К remains nothing but an empty form: as the literary scholar Patricia Crain points out, "the [smallest] unit of textual meaning - the letter - lacks meaning itself."10 In short, the letter Kako's literal meanings, as well as its status as an individual letter - cut off from the chain of signifiers, standing for nothing on its own - are indicative of the hero Akakii's position: alienated from a meaningful context, he is but a blank reverberation, incapable of signifying anything beyond himself. "A3 БУКИ ВЕДИ": THE ALPHABETIC BACKGROUND The chronicle of Russian orthography is punctuated by battles over various "superfluous" letters. A partial victory was declared with Peter the Great's orthographic reforms of 1708- 10, in which certain obsolete characters were eliminated from the Russian language.11 Peter himself initiated and oversaw the creation of a new civil script (grazhdanskii shrift ); the triumph of his "European, secular" script over the "barbarous, clerical" Church Slavonic characters became a graphic emblem of the Petrine enlightenment.12 Following Peter's orthographic overhaul, periodic adjustments and suggestions for further change were proposed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, culminating in a second 9TST.

Their debates over these superfluous Slavonic letters, which were widely reported in the mainstream press and discussed in scholarly circles, generated impassioned responses both poetic and scientific.14 Creative treatments of the alphabet question tended to feature personified letters; indeed, according to Mikhail Vaiskopf, the period in question saw a rebirth of the playful tradition associating the letters of the alphabet with social figures, and particularly with members of the Russian bureaucratic hierarchy.15 The literary use of anthropomorphic alphabets was already firmly established by the nineteenth century, famously modeled by eminent eighteenth-century authors like Lomonosov, Fonvizin, and Kantemir. Lomonosov's 1750 play The Trial of the Russian Letters , in which the letters voice longstanding quarrels with each other over position and merit, brought literary visibility to the tradition of personified letters. In this humorous sketch, Grammar brings the Russian characters to a court presided over by Reason and Custom, so that they may voice their longstanding quarrels over place and distinction. Each presents his assets, as well as his particular grievances against other letters; lať (Ъ), for instance, complains that "E выгоняет меня из мЪста, владения и наследия, однако я не уступлю" (Е is driving me out of my place, my property, and my inheritance, though I will not admit defeat).16 In the years just preceding Gogol's composition of "The Overcoat," this curious convention was most prominently displayed in a pair of famous missives written from the point of view of the letters Izhitsa (y) and 1er (Ъ), in which these "endangered" characters defend their position in the alphabet by appealing to their illustrious genealogies and long service to the state.17 According to scholars, the new wave of excitement and curiosity over the Russian alphabet was sparked in part by the publication of Nikolai Grech's influential grammars of 1827. 18 A moderate reformer, Grech singled out certain redundant letters for 13The reforms of 1917, designed by philologist Aleksei Shakhmatov and carried out shortly after the Revolution, eliminated four more archaic letters as well as the redundant hard sign at the end of words. 14For a concise review of these polemics see M. P. Alekseev, "Zapiš' Pushkina o 'Tragedii, sostavlennoi iz azbuki frantsuzskoi,"' in Pushkin: Sravnitel'no-istoricheskie issledovaniia , ed. M. P. Alekseev (Leningrad, 1972), 401-10. Alekseev provided the first full account of the orthography question, summarizing the heated intellectual atmosphere surrounding Pushkin's own brief additions to the debates. Literary scholar Mikhail Vaiskopf and Professor of Philology Světlana Drugovejko-Dolzhanskaia both build on Alekseev's superb foundation, contributing to the list of scientific, literary, and mystical responses to the alphabet question in their own research. Vaiskopf was the first to bring the discussion of these polemics together with an analysis of "The Overcoat." See Vaiskopf, Siuzhet Gogolia , 321-23; and Světlana Drugoveiko-Dolzhanskaia: "K istorii russkoi azbuki," in Iazyk i tekst: Mezhvuzovskii sborník pamiati M. A. Sokolovoi , ed. V. V.

The critic and editor N. I. Nadezhdin quickly jumped to the disgraced letter's defense, complaining that Grech had "chased Izhitsa from the alphabetic Eden," and responding with a humorous poem entitled "Izhitsa к Azu." Nadezhdin's celebrated piece, published in Vestnik Evropy in 1828, features the desperate pleas of the exiled letter Izhitsa, targeted by many nineteenth-century orthographic reformers as superfluous. The persecuted letter appeals to Az (A), the "Sovereign first-born of the characters," pleading her case for continued residency in the "family of letters."19 She recalls past perils, such as the orthographic reforms of Peter, when, "with a motion of Peter's hand, we were gripped by a new alarm! Our ancient calm was shaken! And - a revolution was begun!", and reminds Az of various fallen brothers and sisters, including "round-bellied Fita " (0), "angular, sinuous Ksf' (4), and "three-pronged PsF ('|/). Her own self-defense rests on her illustrious genealogy and varied service as she matured from Upsilon into Igrek.20 A similar petition for mercy, this time from 1er , was advanced the following year. According to Pushkin scholar L. A. Chereiskii, during a 1 829 stay in Petersburg the German scholar Alexander von Humboldt publicly advanced his opinion on the "uselessness of the existence of the hard sign in the Russian alphabet."21 His assessment was countered the following day in the form of a humorous letter from the affronted hard sign, composed by the then-famous writer A. A. Perovskii under the pseudonym "Antonii Pogorel'skii." Like Izhitsa before him, 1er builds his defense on issues of ancestry, service to the empire, and citizenship: "I am the letter 1er, and I occupy a rather important place in the Russian alphabet. Around ten centuries have passed since the day of my birth, and no one has dared to deny my existence or to dispute those services which I have rendered, and continue to render, to the Russian language to this day."22 Various other treatments of the alphabet question abounded, and between 1 828 and 1832 the pages of such widely read journals as Moskovskii vestnik , Syn otechestva , Moskovskii telegraf, and Molva brimmed with orthographic discourse. Another particularly faddish literary treatment of the alphabet question materialized in 1828, the same year Gogol arrived in Petersburg, in the anonymously published "Manuscript of the deceased Khabarov," written by P. L. Iakovlev, the brother of Pushkin's lyceum friend.23 The work consists of the fictional autobiography of a certain Khabarov, a retired proofreader and printer who bears a striking resemblance to another copyist who would make his own literary debut in 1842. 24 Like Akakii after him, Khabarov contents himself with the humblest of 19N.

He even chooses favorites and least- favorites among them, deriding 1er as a "sponger," and lať as a "pushy hypocrite or troublesome idler."25 Khabarov's "diary" gives way to a lengthy treatise on the alphabet, in which he contends that only twenty-seven letters are truly necessary to the Russian language. The work was widely discussed in the press, and reviewers from Moskovskii vestnik , Syn otechestva , and Moskovskii telegraf agreed, at least conditionally, with the fictional printer's ideas for alphabet reform.26 In addition to the polemics surrounding the superfluous letters, the question of discerning some sort of intrinsic meaning among the alphabet's shapes and sounds likewise became fashionable at the start of the nineteenth century. In one 1 829 article in Moskovskii vestnik , for instance, a young linguist named Dmitrii Obleukhov earnestly attempted to prove that the characters of various ancient alphabets derived from graphic representations of human faces and bodies. Alongside this search for meaning among the letters' forms, efforts to interpret their formal Church Slavonic names in alphabetic succession as coherent text were also quite prevalent and widely published in these years; one of the earliest attempts to decode the alphabet's imenniki was mocked by Pushkin himself. In the commentary to his 1823 edition of the Igor Tale , the philologist and literary scholar N. F. Grammatin contended that the letters of the Slavic alphabet spelled out an idea, and went on to reconstruct an original meaning. Pushkin objected strongly to Grammatin's suppositions, scoffing that "The letters that make up the Slavonic alphabet do not possess any meaning whatsoever. Az , Buki , Vedi, Glagol' Dobro , etc., are individual words, chosen only for their initial sound."27 Similarly, in 1832 Teleskop published a lengthy article by the writer-philologist Orest Evetskii arguing that each alphabet possesses its own symbolic, mystical idea. He concludes his piece with his reconstruction of the original "meaning" behind the Cyrillic letters: "Я, Бог Всеведущий, заповедываю: хорошо есть жить произрастениями земли и, подобно людям, мыслить. В том наш покой. Произноси наставление (сие) с чувством" (I, God all-knowing, command: it is good to live by the sprouting of the land and, like people, to think. In that is our peace. Pronounce this exhortation with feeling).28 A reviewer for the same journal, hiding behind the letter "K," objected to Evetskii's formulation, stating that "neither was there in the beginning, nor is there now, any meaning in them." Even for this seemingly level-headed reviewer, however, the current fascination with letters proves irresistible, and he goes on to propose his own, simplified "meaning" for the Russian alphabet: 25Iakovlev, "Rukopis'," 24, 25, 39. 26For full reviews see Moskovskii vestnik 2, no. 17 (1828): 69-73; Syn otechestva 120, no. 8 (1828): 81-84; and Moskovskii telegrafii , no. 11 (1828): 503-6. 27N.

Think: It is Our Peace! Say the Word Firmly. Finally, in 1 83 1 , the delightfully named "A. Bukov" published a plan for the exclusion of certain letters in the journal Molva.30 A reluctant reformer, Bukov (a pseudonym for Nadezhdin) clearly feels sympathy for many of the "endangered" letters of the alphabet, and lovingly recounts their "genealogies" and distinct personalities while deliberating which to "exclude from the permanent staff."31 Bukov's unbridled love for his favorite letters ("Ah! If only you could know how I love them all! How hard it was to write my philippic against them!"), their humanization under his pen ("I find in them the first impressions of infancy, knowledge, the ability to speak - that precious advantage of man"), is touchingly reminiscent of Akakii chuckling over his own favority?2 In short, the question of the alphabet was on everyone's lips throughout Gogol's time in the Russian capital. The author arrived in St. Petersburg in 1828, just as the most recent wave of the orthography question began to swell. He immediately inserted himself into Petersburg's literary and academic circles, and would undoubtedly have been familiar with both the issues and polemics surrounding the alphabet and with its various literary treatments. During the most vigorous period of discussion, Gogol composed his Petersburg tales, four of which appeared in 1835 and 1836. "The Overcoat" was composed between 1839 and 1841, and published in his Collected Works of 1842; there is ample evidence to suggest that the work was conceived and developed much earlier, however, at the height of the alphabet debates.33 The alphabet would have provided Gogol a natural environment for working out issues of rank and order within the bureaucratic world of Petersburg. Within the alphabet, a haven of classification and control, each character occupies a strictly designated place. Even within this seemingly meaningless realm of alphabetic symbols, a hierarchy is still in operation: Az is king, and Izhitsa must beg to be included. Her supplications before the almighty Az illustrate that rank and status are seen as powerful forces within the alphabetic order. The superfluous letters' assertions of long service and ancient lineage implicitly recall the Petrine legacy of bureaucracy: after all, Peter the Great himself had dictated the content, order, and form of the contemporary Cyrillic alphabet, casting out certain old 29"K," "O russkoi azbuke (otryvok iz pis'ma)," Teleskop 7, no. 23 (1832): 430, 431. 30A.

Critics have also pointed out Pushkin's diary entry concerning the robberies of certain "persons of consequence" in Petersburg; the observation was recorded in 1833, during a period of lively contact between the two writers (see Julian Graffy, Gogol's The Overcoat [London, 2000], 64). Finally, according to Gogol's friend P. V. Annenkov, the initial inspiration for "The Overcoat" - the oft-repeated anecdote about a poor clerk who attains and loses a hunting gun - dated from the mid- 1830s. Cited in James B.

The simplified civil azbuka , drawn up and decreed by the tsar himself, exemplifies his reverence for hierarchy and control; his pitiless exclusion of outmoded letters, despite their ancient "lineage" or illustrious name, mirrors his establishment of the Table of Ranks and the privileging of worth over birth - a few years after the orthographic reforms, Peter would reorganize the military and civil services along parallel lines, dividing its members into fourteen rigidly hierarchical classes, according to merit alone. Though his system was nominally merit-based, the tsar ensured that every citizen knew his proper place. A3 - БУКИ: AKAKII AS LETTER The text of Gogol's "The Overcoat" incorporates numerous hints about Akakii's overly familiar relationship with letters. The hero's initials, А. Б., implicitly draw attention to his alphabetic origins: as in the Greek and other Western words for the alphabet, the Russian term " azbuka " is formed from these first two letters (Аз and Буки). While old mnemonics and primers dating from Gogol's time taught "Аз Буки Веди" or "I know the letters," Akakii's initials suggest "Аз - Буки," or "I am the letter(s)." But with so many letters to choose from, how exactly did Gogol settle on Kakol Aside from semantic reasons, did the author have an alphabetical basis for his choice of the letter K? It is worth noting that the threatened letters of the day were lowly characters of negligible status, far from the almighty Az' Ksi , Psi, and Izhitsa, for instance, came 40th, 41st, and 42nd in the 42-letter azbuka. Kako , on the other hand, was a sort of "middling" letter in the alphabetic order; stuck on a rung neither low nor high, the thirteenth letter was, like Akakii himself, an eternally average character.34 Perhaps not surprisingly, the focus of the orthography debates never strayed from those characters at the very top (Az) and those at the bottom {Izhitsa and her friends), while those in the middle remained critically overlooked.35 If Akakii Bashmachkin's initials divulge his alphabetic domain, then the literal basis of his name and patronymic reveal his fated position within it: no matter how many obsolete letters might be shorn from the end of the sequence, К would always find itself right in the middle of the pack - an uncelebrated but essential member of the hierarchy. A "literal servant of the letter" ( chinovnik dlia pis'ma ), Akakii's sole bureaucratic occupation lies in the reproduction of others' words; far from bored by the seeming lifelessness of his position, however, the clerk's singular delight lies in letters and their calligraphic reproduction. He copies and recopies with ardor and tenderness, the strength of his emotions betraying an unusual intimacy between the man and his copied-out characters: "he worked zealously - no, he worked with love."36 At home, after he has satisfied his meager physical needs, he copies more letters out of both enjoyment and a sort of textual 34I would like to thank one of my anonymous reviewers for bringing this "middling letter" reading to my attention. 350ne of the most famous titles from the period, "Izhitsa k Azu" is emblematic of this phenomenon: perhaps the true superfluous letter here is the lowercase k sandwiched between the two alphabetic VIPs! 36Gogol' PSS 3:144.</page><page sequence="9">Како сделан Акакий 195 insatiability. Не compulsively makes duplicate copies for himself, then drifts to sleep, dreaming only of the comely consonants he might encounter the following day: "Having written to his heart's content, he would go to bed, smiling ahead of time at the thought of the next day: what would God send him to copy tomorrow?"37 The pen serves as a physical connection between the copyist and his work; perhaps in the absence of a flesh-and-blood mother (who is referred to as deceased even at Akakii's birth) or father (who seems to have contributed only a name to his son's conception), this conduit between body and text acts as a sort of umbilical cord, providing Akakii with his sole source of spiritual union and nourishment.38 The narrator hints that Akakii truly lives within his own paper world, inhabiting the even lines of copy alongside his own orderly letters: "You could scarcely have found another man who lived so much in his work ."39 In early versions of the story, copying provides Akakii a safe and pleasant space, separate from office tormenters and twenty-below chills; by the final version, this private parchment world has bloomed into an entire cosmos, diverse and satisfying: "There, in that copying, he saw some varied and pleasant world of his own."40 Akakii's absorption into his textual world is so complete that the flow of script is interrupted only occasionally, with his coworkers' jostling, for instance, or a sudden gust from a horse's muzzle. Among the letters, he has certain pets, whom he greets with particular warmth: "Certain letters were his favorites, and whenever he came to them he was quite beside himself: he would laugh softly to himself, and wink, and help things along with his lips."41 Akakii's intimate, almost flirtatious relationship with these letters reduces man and letter to a single emotional and physical plane; his playful behavior toward them simultaneously breathes life into the printed characters and objectifies the hero, pushing him further into the abstract world of the text. This correspondence is reinforced as letters inscribe themselves on Akakii's face while he copies them: "In his face, it seemed, it was possible to read every letter that his quill traced."42 This plotting of abstraction upon flesh indicates an ontological equivalence of man and word. The unusual emotional connection and physical confluence between man and letter hint at the hero's psychological position within the alphabet alongside his beloved буквы ; no mere duplicator of letters, he himself is a duplicated letter. Just as Akakii's favorite letters transcribe themselves upon his skin, he likewise perceives his own handwriting superimposed on the world outside of his texts: "Whenever he looked at something, he saw on everything his own clean lines, written out in his even hand."43 Indeed, the copyist confuses life and letter to the point where he is frequently shocked to find that he is not in the middle of a printed line, but in the middle of a Petersburg liniia. This textual assimilation of the hero blurs the line between real and written, leveling human and alphabetic characters and reinforcing Akakii's status as letter.44 37Ibid., 146. 38Ibid., 142. 39Ibid., 144 (emphasis added). 40Ibid. 4,Ibid. 42Ibid. 43Ibid., 145. 44"The Overcoat" is hardly the only Gogol text that blurs the boundary between animate and inanimate; in fact, this merging of spirit and matter is a central feature of the Gogolian fictional universe. Body parts</page><page sequence="10">196 Kathleen Scollins "Я ТОГО...": AKAKII'S VERBAL POSITION Akakii is virtually defined by his creative incapacity. Before the narrator conveys any of his hero's actual speech, we learn that he never responds "a single word" to his office tormentors.45 After dinner, in the hours other clerks dedicate to apparently more verbally creative pleasures - theater, flirtation, gossip and jokes - Akakii prefers the company of letters he has purloined from work, which he lovingly traces out for his own collection. When he does attempt to speak, Akakii 's verbal output is confined to prepositions, adverbs, and particles - all parts of speech that bear no independent meaning, empty verbal forms whose significance is determined by context alone. Like the kako at the core of his name, the prepositions and particles that compose Akakii 's speech are solely relational, dependent on other, absent words for meaning. In fact, as numerous scholars have detailed, Akakii is in love only with the outward form of words, their material manifestation rather than their abstract function. His job as a copy clerk neatly encapsulates this superficial relationship to language: although he reproduces other people's words all day, he remains pitifully unable to express his desires or even keep his own words under control. His physical reflection of the letters he copies only reinforces the impression of his own verbal vacuity. In short, Akakii is a consummate copier, immobilized by any hint of verbal invention: even a purely formal adjustment from the first- to third-person proves unfathomable.46 Initially, at least, Akakii represents verbal form without content, a letter without context - the "raw material" for language, without the means to "mean." Akakii's lack of content leaves only an empty form to be filled or controlled by others. Indeed, as Richard Peace and S. G. Bocharov have argued, Akakii finds himself under the verbal control of nearly every other character in the tale; in narrative terms, Akakii cannot tell his own story - he can only be written or "authored" by another.47 His embryonic speech is explicitly contrasted with the verbal authority of various characters, particularly that of the Important Personage (IP). The bureaucratic function of the IP, of course, relies perform a grotesque parade down Nevskii Prospekt , while a nos acquires a rank, dons a uniform, and achieves social substance. Meanwhile, Gogol's apparently human characters are often conceived as "inert material," no more alive than the souls Chichikov purchases; men and women are reduced to side whiskers and sleeves, and at any instant the human face might become a samovar, melon, cucumber, egg, or pancake (Donald Fanger, The Creation of Nikolai Gogol [Cambridge, MA, 1979], 254). Gogol's very titles hint at this problem of animacy: they call into question the aliveness of the living (and the deadness of the dead), either by taking an inanimate object as hero ("Nevsky Prospect," "Nose") or by confusing the categories entirely (Dead Souls). "The Overcoat" is not even the only text that conflates written and living characters: in Dead Souls, the names of the dead serfs appear to take on life as Chichikov reads them, and in "Diary of a Madman" Poprishchin's sense of power (he is the King of Ispaniia) derives anagrammatically from his writing (the genitive of pisanie ). See Richard Arthur Peace, The Enigma of Gogol: An Examination of the Writings of N. V. Gogol and Their Place in the Russian Literary Tradition (Cambridge, England, 1981), 129; and Richard Gregg, "'Diary of a Madman': The Fallible Scribe and the Sinister Bulge," Slavic and East European Journal 43 (Autumn 1999): 444-45.

In the text, the IP responds to Akakii's appeal in an abrupt and imposing voice specially contrived to befit his commanding position. He is explicitly associated with verbal power, and his words invested with a destructive potency: he is "absolutely intoxicated by the thought that his word could deprive a man of his very senses."48 "ВСЕ ЗАРАЖЕНО ПОДРАЖАНИЕМ": A CAPITAL OF COPIERS The IP's easy domination of the tongue-tied scribe may demonstrate power, but it hardly qualifies him as a verbal creator. In fact, in Peace's formulation, Akakii "falls victim to one who is also a 'copier of words.'"49 As scholars frequently note, the IP's imposing verbal performance is just that: a performance, complete with dress rehearsals and a script.50 The commanding voice, whose pitch alone is enough to knock Akakii off his feet, turns out to have been specially contrived and practiced before a mirror for just such an occasion.51 And the "content" of his speech, at least among inferiors, is composed almost entirely of memorized phrases, practiced and forcefully repeated. He even clings to a few favorite words, just as Akakii dotingly reproduces his own favorite letters: Обыкновенный разговор его с низшими отзывался строгостью и состоял почти из трех фраз: "Как вы смеете? Знаете ли вы, с кем говорите? Понимаете ли, кто стоит перед вами?"52 His usual conversation with subordinates resounded with strictness and consisted almost entirely of three phrases: "How dare you? Do you know who you're talking to? Do you understand who's standing before you?" The very Akakian paucity of the IP's speech is heightened by the Kakos that crowd his pet phrases: как, с кем, кто. These creative limitations - the rote-learned phrases, the mechanical repetition, the linguistic breakdown in certain contexts - accumulate, finally adding up to the impression that the IP, whose words carry weight in the Petersburg context, actually "suffers from a verbal poverty not unlike that of Akakii Akakievich himself."53 It should be noted, however, that within the context of Peter's city, the IP - no matter how imitative his voice - nonetheless holds social and verbal power over his subordinates. He is simultaneously victim and enforcer of the status quo. Thus, the IP - literally, the "Significant Face" ( znachitel'noe litso) - becomes emblematic of the entire, endlessly deferred process of signification in Peter's city: one gains a degree of significance (and signifying power) through rank, but will always remain 48Gogol' PSS 3:167. 49Peace, "Gogol and Psychological Realism," 72. 50Woodward, Peace, and Sloane have all commented on the IP's own oral deficiencies. 51 Gogol', PSS 3:166. 52Ibid., 165. 53Peace, "Gogol and Psychological Realism," 7 1 .</page><page sequence="12">198 Kathleen Scollins insignificant (and as "unsignifying" as Akakii) in relation to one's superiors. Within this world of verbal imitators, a rigid hierarchy persists: Akakii finds himself under the linguistic dominion of higher-ranking copyists who, in turn, merely impersonate those who occupy a more "significant" rung.54 Ultimately, this ladder of verbal influence extends all the way up to the author of the city - that master signifier himself- Peter the Great: the strict bureaucratic grid of his city isolates and imprisons its citizens within discrete boxes, reducing them to a set of "characters" bereft of content.55 This Petersburg pecking order bears a striking resemblance to the alphabetic chain of command illustrated in the superfluous Izhitsď s supplications before the powerful Az : even in this abstract empire of letters, it seems, a strict social order is observed. These two hierarchies are analogous structures, both metaphorically and historically: Peter winnowed and reordered the alphabet five years after the foundation of Petersburg; in 1722, spurred on, no doubt, by the same drive toward order and classification, he formed the Table of Ranks, which organized his subjects according to the same principles. These "characters" undergo a critical loss of identity upon entry into the Table: as the narrator informs us in the opening paragraph, just before revealing his hero's title, "with us one must first of all declare rank."56 In "The Overcoat," Petersburg teems with these scripted homunculi, whom Gogol figures as personified letters constituting the tsar's city-text. Akakii is only their most flagrant example, the emblem of these unsignifying signifiers that populate the Russian capital. The seemingly creative preoccupations of Akakii 's fellow clerks - theater, flirtation, and jokes - require only a script and some practice reciting lines. Even the IP, whose raspekanie (a sort of "verbal roasting") will nearly reduce Akakii to ashes, is ultimately shown to be nothing more than a higher-level copy-clerk. The A-B-C structure of Gogol's Petersburg reveals the very literal foundations of this struggle for linguistic access, as Peter - the father of both the modern Russian alphabet and the modern bureaucratic hierarchy - maintains control over the very building blocks of power. Petersburg's constituent sign-system comprises more than just the Table of Ranks: medals and money, sideburns and styles - in short, anything that denotes significance - combine to confer and communicate their wearer's social position. The result is a self- regulating structure, in which members know their own - as well as their neighbor's - place: failure to follow form is met with ridicule or a reprimand, while adherence is applauded. The system is like an already-written narrative, which Peter composed, and to which his citizens still conform; unable to deviate from the script already in place, they can only repeat it, over and over. The IP articulates to Akakii a chain of command whose function is to structure this city-text, holding each scripted character in his proper place.57 In essence, the entire semiotic system of Petersburg - all the collars, copies, and roped-off 54This law of imitation extends from the linguistic realm into the bureaucratic, as the occupant of each rung mimics his superiors; one ambitious, low-level clerk even ropes off a tiny "receiving room," no larger than his desk, for receiving his supplicants. 55See Woodward for another interpretation of the hierarchical "boxes" of Peter's Table of Ranks (Symbolic Art , 96-98). 56Gogol', PSS 3:141. 57Ibid., 166 ("First of all you should have filed a petition about that in the main office; it would have gone on to the chief clerk, then to the department director, then to my secretary, who would have submitted it to me").</page><page sequence="13">Како сделан Акакий 199 chambers - serves only to reinforce the pre-existing reality of Peter's order. The capital, as represented in "The Overcoat," has become an inorganic and inflexible text, its strict and well-proportioned gridlines littered with lifeless letters. In Gogol's Petersburg, apparently, occupying a box in the Table renders one more or less unable to signify , to create or determine meaning. ЖИВЕТЕ, МЫСЛЕТЕ, СЛОВО, ТВЕРДО: THE LETTERS COME TO LIFE When read against this inflexible narrative of replication, Akakii's rise from copier to petitioner stands out as a uniquely anti-Petersburg transformation. Initially, of course, the clerk seems to exist within the text of his documents: literally a Kako begotten of an identical letter Kako. Gradually, however, some of his trademark "prepositions and particles" develop into a more assertive style: the scribe attempts to speak up for himself to Petrovich, the sentry, the police commissioner, and, finally, the IP. Most critics pinpoint the receipt of the overcoat {shinel*) as the turning point in Akakii's drama, whether they interpret it socially, religiously, or psychoanalytically.58 Peace, for instance, focuses on the social and psychological awakening brought on by his purchase; Anthony Hippisley finds that "the new overcoat symbolizes Christ himself'; and Daniel Rancour-Laferriere discerns a re- orientation in Akakii's sexuality triggered by this garment-wife.59 Does the scribe's union with his "pleasant life's companion" likewise initiate his linguistic transformation?60 In fact, careful examination of the text reveals that the overcoat actually serves to keep its wearer silent. Early on, following the deterioration of his housecoat ( kapot ), Akakii exhibits signs of verbal creativity: he employs some verbal cunning in his first attempt to sway Petrovich, presenting the threadbare old coat as a new one А я вот того, Петрович ... шинель-то, сукно ... вот видишь, везде в других местах, совсем крепкое, оно немножко запылилось, и кажется, как будто старое, а оно новое.61 And I've sort of come, Petrovich ... that overcoat, you know, the cloth ... well, you see, everywhere else it's quite strong; it got a bit dusty and seems old, but it's new. When he hears the tailor's estimate, the gentle copyist raises his voice "for the first time since birth," and even returns a week later to plead his case again.62 Once he has received his new overcoat, however, he seems to retreat back into silence: through the entire eight- page paragraph that spans the life of the overcoat - from its conception at Petrovich 's to its 58For a general overview of the various critical readings of the overcoat, as well as its role in Akakii's transformation, see Graffy, Gogol's The Overcoat , 99-100. 59Peace, "Gogol and Psychological Realism," 73-76; Anthony Hippisley, "Gogor's 'The Overcoat : A Further Interpretation," Slavic and East European Journal 20 (Summer 1976): 124-25; Daniel Rancour-Laferriere, Out from under Gogol's Overcoat: A Psychoanalytical Study (Ann Arbor, 1982), 115-17. 60Gogol' PSS 3:154. 61Ibid., 150. 62Ibid., 151.</page><page sequence="14">200 Kathleen Scollins disappearance in the square - Akakii does not utter a single word.63 As soon as he loses the overcoat, however, he instantly regains his voice: immediately following its theft, he erupts into speech, furiously accusing the sentry on duty of sleeping on the job. His indictment is the first in a chain of increasingly powerful and original verbal acts, culminating in his postmortem invective. While the hero's passage from the "official" text of Peter 's bureaucracy into the dynamic free-play of signification might appear to be tied up in the figure of the overcoat, his transformation is narratively expressed in terms of his beloved letters. Gogol explicitly incorporates the names of specific Cyrillic letters as such into the story, unambiguously suggesting their embodiment in the story's hero. In the first draft of "The Overcoat," the narrator identifies by name exactly which letters etch themselves upon Akakii 's face. As the hero playfully greets the letters he encounters in his copying, we see the letters Ж, M, C, and T reproduced upon his features as he helps them along with his lips: Так что [иногда] для охотника можно в лице читать бы[ло] всякую букву. Живете , мыслете , слово , твердо- всё это просто рисовалось и отпечатывалось на лице его. Губы его невольно и сжимались и послаблялись и [обраща&lt;лись?&gt;] как будто даже отчасти помогали"64 So that [sometimes], if you looked, it was possible to read every letter in his face. Zhivete, Myslete , Slovo, Tverdo - all this simply traced and printed itself onto his face. His lips involuntarily tightened and relaxed and [twisted about], as though in some measure helping out. The names of these letters (loosely translated as Life, Thought, Word, Strength) all represent qualities that the hero lacks; to him they are simply letterforms, meaningless calligraphic shapes, consonant love objects. As Vaiskopf astutely points out, the very characters that etched themselves upon Akakii 's body in the draft (Ж, M, С, T, or Живете, Мыслете, Слово and Твердо) reappear together in the final draft, after the hero has lost his housecoat and awaits his new overcoat. In the space of a single paragraph, as the narrator describes the changes that have overcome the hero, three of the letter names resurface in magnified form: Akakii has become more alive , his character firmer , and he is visited by bold thoughts : Он сделался как-то живее , даже тверже характером, как человек, который уже определил и поставил себе цель. С лица и с поступков его исчезло само собою сомнение, нерешительность- словом, все колеблющиеся и неопределенные черты. Огонь порою показывался 63The narrator does report that the clerk, self-conscious before his overenthusiastic officemates, finally stammers out a disavowal of his acquisition, claiming that it is not new at all, but we don't actually hear his words. In any case, it is interesting that his sole act of reported speech during this time is to deny the new coat's existence, as though his verbal activity depended on its absence. Note that his denial constitutes an inversion of the earlier scene at the tailor's, when Akakii attempted to convince Petrovich of his housecoat's physical integrity; in a period of true verbal growth, it seems, Akakii can invent a coat; in a time of verbal stagnation, he negates one. 64Gogol', PSS 3:447 n.l (emphases added). Vaiskopf was the first to note the inclusion of these letter-names in the draft version of "The Overcoat" (Siuzhet Gogolia , 336-37).</page><page sequence="15">Како сделан Акакий 201 в глазах его, в голове даже мелькали самые дерзкие и отважные мысли : не положить ли, точно, куницу на воротник?65 Не became somehow more alive , more determined in character, like a man who has already defined and set himself a goal. Doubt, indecision - in a word, all his hesitant and indefinite qualities - simply disappeared from his face and actions. Fire would occasionally show in his eyes, in his head flashed the most daring and audacious thoughts : and why not put marten on the collar? As Akakii anticipates his new acquisition, these letters seem to penetrate his being - no longer merely printed upon him like characters on a page, they now imbue him with their meanings: Life, Strength , Thought.66 It seems that, unlike these other letters, whose names advertise their salient qualities, Kako can claim no discernible personality: it can only replicate - or be like (как) - its surrounding context. Given the clear lexical correspondences across these two scenes, it is undoubtedly significant that the final letter, Slovo , does not materialize in the same capacity or heightened form alongside the other three letter-names. While the first three - zhivee , tverzhe , mysli - refer directly to Akakii and his new, more animated state, the slovom here simply represents the intrusion of one of the narrator's favorite devices. The absence of proper slova with which to perform these bold mysli implies that, while the hero may have begun his progression toward the Word, he has not yet grasped it. Akakii's loss of the formless housecoat appears to have triggered a passage from the paper world back to the human world: the letter as black-and-white substitute for real life - Ж is for жизнь - now blossoms into life itself. Left unprotected by the holey kapot , and not yet in possession of the chic shinel ', the clerk's empty form begins to fill with borrowed content, as revealed in the animation of the letters Ж, M, and T upon his skin, his sudden embodiment of their meaning ("Life," "Strength," "Thought"). In other words, loss may have initiated Akakii's metamorphosis, but it is language that actually effects it; no sooner has he shed his cotton chrysalis than letters - performative, meaningful, and alive - rush in to fill the lack. Akakii's transformation corresponds to a written letter's shift from empty character ("&amp;") to meaningful word: "к komu" This transformation, however, will be temporary; with his acquisition of the status-giving overcoat, Akakii will be thrust back into Peter's textual city, that paper space dominated and delimited by such hollow signifiers of status. And though Akakii's initial loss has inaugurated the process of signification, he will gain true verbal authority only later, with the greater loss of the overcoat; only then will he step out of "line," challenge his superiors, and speak beyond the constraints of his own rank. One thread connecting the overcoat to the Word is suggested by another widely read article by Nadezhdin on orthographic reform, printed in Teleskop in 1836, in which he comments on Peter the Great's desire and failure to control language. Famously contrasting the unalterable Word with an article of clothing, Nadezhdin writes, 65Gogol', PSS 3:155 (emphases added). 66Vaiskopf, too, notes this shift from "dead letter-outlines" to "Sophianic, living meaning," reading the transformation alongside Akakii's own shift in dream-object, from "dead letters" to podruga zhizni. In this light, the letters' new vitality underscores Akakii's entire ecstatic transformation, which Vaiskopf interprets as a travesty of spiritual ascendance ( Siuzhet Gogolia , 336-37).</page><page sequence="16">202 Kathleen Scollins The autocrat ... knew that the word alone is obedient to no one's command, that it cannot be shaved off as a beard, cut off and altered as clothing. He did everything with it that was in his authority: in accordance with his idea, he changed its alphabetic suit in the European fashion and left the rest to its own devices!67 Seen in this light, the overcoat appears to symbolize Peter's doomed endeavor to retain control over the Word - the stylish European outfits in which he revamped and enclosed the letters to demonstrate his verbal authority. Rancour-Laferriere notes that the word shineV was a relatively new borrowing from Europe, an apparent corruption of the French chenille which had not yet been fully integrated into the Russian case system; at the time, in other words, the garment would have been considered "a European, not a Russian artifice."68 Nadezhdin's striking image of corseting (and thus reining in) the alphabet corresponds to Gogol's vision of the capital as the tsar's own frozen and prearranged city-text, forever preserving the order he established and formalized. In the critic's prophesy, however, his plan is doomed to remain unfulfilled: Peter may have adorned the alphabet in a new set of clothing, he intimates, but the Word will nevertheless maintain its autonomy. In "The Overcoat," it is Peter's spiritual son Petro vich who reenacts the tsar's role of dressing up the letter in a new suit.69 Petrovich has stitched Akakii into an exterior worthy of Peter's Table of Ranks, and the clerk's acceptance of the fashionable overcoat is meant to symbolize his official entry into the Petersburg sign-system.70 In Nadezhdin's succinct 67N. I. Nadezhdin, "Evropeizm i národnost' v otnoshenii к russkoi slovesnosti," Teleskop 3 1 , nos. 1-2 (1836). Vaiskopf also makes note of this extended metaphor, explaining that word and clothing were conventionally linked in contemporary Russian culture ( Siuzhet Gogo lia, 335-36); indeed, Lomonosov famously drew on this association between letter and attire in support of Peter's orthographic reforms ("Under Peter the Great, it was not only the Boyar and his wife, but also the letters, who threw off their bulky fur coats and attired themselves in summer dress"; Lomonosov, PSS 7:391). 68Rancour-Laferriere, Out from under Gogol s Overcoat , 48-49. This was exactly the sort of lexical import that opponents of Peter's project - which had its roots in the Russian orthographical system - had dreaded; in their view, Latinizing the azbuka had initiated a process of contagion that allowed all sorts of foreign terms and exotic spellings to infect the Russian language. See Marcus C. Levitt, "The Barbarians among Us, or Sumarokov's Views on Orthography," in Eighteenth-Century Russia: Society, Culture, Economy: Papers from the VII International Conference of the Study Group on Eighteenth-Century Russia, Wittenburg, 2004 , ed. Roger P. Bartlett and Gabriela Lehmann-Carli (Berlin, 2007), 63. Donning this French fashion would seem to represent Akakii's advance into a "foreign" world of artifice and status; furthermore, in the shift from kapot to shineV , Akakii sheds a kako , his ascent into upmarket apparel signaling a readiness to cast off his middling status and move up in the hierarchy of letters. It is important to remember, however, that the old kapot , however shabby, was also a European article, associated with both the French capote (a hooded coat) and the German kaput (the end, death); ever since Peter threw open his window to the West, apparently, there was no escaping this web of foreign borrowings and miscopyings. 69In fact, the overcoat itself is revealed as an oral production, underscoring this connection between the shinel' and language: "Petrovich then went over each seam with his own teeth, imprinting various patterns with them" (Gogol', PSS 3:156). The tailor appears to have outfitted Akakii in a coat stitched of letters (the "figures" he produces with his mouth), a garment fairly bursting at the seams with language. Likewise, our first glimpse of the tailor - unsuccessfully guiding a thread into the ukho of a needle, just as he will soon guide his "verbal effects" into ear of his unwilling customer - conflates the oral and the sartorial, setting up Petrovich 's enticing threads for verbal interpretation. 70The tailor's solemn cloaking of his client reads like an oddly delayed coming-of-age ritual, where Akakii signals his readiness to enter into Peter's order; indeed, his makeover recalls the eighteenth-century conversion testimonies of citizens obliged to renounce their old values and accept Peter's cultural innovations. See Zhivov, Language and Culture , 49-51.</page><page sequence="17">Како сделан Акакий 203 formula, however, Peter fails to cut the alphabet to order, and instead simply fits it out in a new set of clothes. Indeed, just as the tsar's plan to shear the Word into shape goes unrealized, Petrovich fails in his own bid to swathe Akakii in a suitable façade: the overcoat is stolen, and the hero is set free to signify for himself. "HE ЗНАЕТЕ ПОРЯДКА?" STEPPING OUT OF LINE Akakii 's emergent embrace of the Word may be traced alongside his shifting relationship to his superiors, those authority figures once in a position to "author" him. Following his rebuke of the negligent watchman, Akakii demands and receives a meeting with the police commissioner; these verbal appeals, so far removed from the incomprehensible stuttering of the past, indicate the clerk's evolution beyond "authored" status into authoritative signification. Akakii finally moves on to his disastrous audience with the IP. With his insignificant appearance and unintelligible speech - face to face with this Significant Face, he has reverted to stammering, "с прибавлением даже чаще, чем в другое время, частиц 'того'" (with the addition of even more frequent "ums" and "ers") - Akakii cuts a profoundly unthreatening figure.71 Nonetheless, by appearing in person rather than on paper before the IP - by failing to follow the paper trail - Akakii signals a brazen willingness to circumvent the "chain of chin " so carefully itemized by the general.72 Like a letter's independent advancement up the alphabetic ranks, or even out of the alphabetic order altogether, Akakii's sidestep "out of line" profoundly jeopardizes the established hierarchy. By leaving the tidy lines of "official" language and attempting to enter the realm of living, creative language, Akakii represents a threat to Peter's order. The IP is outraged by this breach of form, and delivers his raspekanie with the clear intent to incinerate this disruptive paper-and-ink upstart. Having lost this challenge over the creative Word, Akakii once again appears to be at the mercy of others' language. After being raked over the coals by the IP, Akakii develops a burning fever; a doctor arrives just in time to examine the delirious clerk, and then loudly prescribes a poultice and a coffin.73 "Had Akakii Akakievich heard these fateful words spoken?" muses the narrator following the doctor's fatal diagnosis, suggesting that it is the verdict of impending death - in other words, language itself - that brings about the patient's final demise.74 The IP's fire arrives too late to annihilate Akakii, however: although the clerk "dragged himself home, lacking the strength to say a single word," he soon erupted into full-blown language, cursing the IP in a rush of terrible, uncontrollable words: "his little old landlady even crossed herself, never having heard anything like this from him before, especially as the words immediately followed 'Your Excellency.'"75 For the first time since the early description of Akakii's meaningless speech patterns, the narrator refers explicitly to Akakii's 71 Gogol', PSS 3:166. 72Graffy, Gogol's The Overcoat , 104. 73The doctor's priparka (from the root par-, or steam) fits neatly into the city's unmistakable plan to incinerate the upstart clerk. Woodward also surveys this burning motif, translating the IP's raspekaniia as "comprehensive bakings" ( Symbolic Art , 97-108). 74Gogol', PSS 3:168. 75Ibid., 167, 168.</page><page sequence="18">204 Kathleen Scollins own words: "Наконец, даже сквернохульничал, произнося самые страшные слова " (Finally, he even began to curse, pronouncing the most terrible words).16 With this reference, Akakii has finally succeeded in following all of his favorite copied-out letters - Zhivete , Myslete , Tverdo , and now Slovo - off the page and into life. He now embodies a heightened form not only of the first three ( zhivee , tverzhe , and myslí), but of the word (the plural slova) as well. This end-of-life union with the Word metaphorically completes his process of vivification. This embodiment of the "living letters" also explains why Akakii did not fall silent with his metaphorical combustion. His assimilation of the letters' meaning - Life, Thought, Strength, and now the Word - means that he is no paper prisoner of Peter's textual world: he has gained meaning. By all rights, the IP's blistering rebuke should have obliterated him - had Akakii remained an empty letterform, his superior's scolding would have burnt him to a crisp; instead, the emancipating blaze merely scalds the hero's coating, leaving his newly acquired essence exposed, but still intact.77 Read as the realization of the alphabet motif, Akakii 's deathbed curses represent a rebirth into language. These curses, however, can hardly be considered coherent, meaningful language - they are, rather, like the furious cries of a newborn. It is hardly surprising, then, that the process of language acquisition continues in the afterlife, when the scribe is reborn as a corpse; the next time he opens his mouth, his speech to the IP is intimidating and significant: А! так вот ты наконец! наконец я тебя того, поймал за воротник! твоей-то шинели мне и нужно! не похлопотал об моей, да еще и распек, - отдавай же теперь свою!78 A-ha, so it's finally you! Finally I have you, er, by the collar! It's your overcoat I need! You didn't trouble yourself about mine, and even gave me a roasting - now hand yours over! Although a certain unshakable verbal marker (togo) identifies the corpse as the same stuttering scribe, Akakii 's language has now become powerful and effectual: the insistent imperfective imperative he levels at his victim (hand yours over!) meets with immediate compliance. More significantly, following the encounter, the IP undergoes a scaled-down transformation of his own, uttering his memorized threats with slightly less frequency. In a word, Akakii 's once-senseless speech has finally achieved both meaning and performativity: he has gained a sort of rival Word to challenge and transform the fixed Petersburg order. In alphabetic terms, the hero Kako has finally arrived at the Slovo so long beyond his reach. 76Ibid. (emphasis added). 77Ironically, the IP's "roasting" appears to have contributed to Akakii 's spiritual (or, in this case, verbal) resurrection. Earlier, as Akakii awaited his overcoat, we saw in his eyes the first glimmers of something resembling vitality - alongside the reflected life (Ж), strength (T), and thought (M), "fire would occasionally show in his eyes" (ibid., 155). Upon donning the overcoat, however, this fledgling flame was smothered - the thick quilting of Petrovich's conventional suit acts as an extinguishing blanket, snuffing out the first flicker of creativity and insulating against any hint of language. The IP's raspekanie , however, amounts to a fiery "baptism," inadvertently rekindling in Akakii an eruption of crude words (C); the former copier will finally rise, phoenix-like, from the ashes to deliver a verbal raspekanie of his own. 78Ibid., 172.</page><page sequence="19">Како сделан Акакий 205 THE LETTERS, FROM КАКО ТО SLOVO At its heart, "The Overcoat" represents a unique artistic transformation of the heated alphabet polemics of the 1820s and 1830s. By setting his tale within the space of the alphabet, Gogol was able to obliquely treat issues of authority and language central to all of his Petersburg stories, and particularly to this, the cycle's final tale. Where the authors of the orthographic debates brought their endangered letters to life, however, Gogol performs an inverse transformation, demoting his hero to the status of letter; in his vision of Petersburg, the bureaucratic masses are flattened into alphabetic characters, crowding the fourteen steps of Peter's Table of Ranks like lettering on lines of text. In this alphabetic reading of "The Overcoat," the hero Akakii is figured as an individual letter, deprived of both content and context, and therefore unable to signify - as such, he epitomizes the verbally vacant, easily dictated subjects of Peter's bureaucratic order. In Gogol's Petersburg, the tsar's revised alphabet - like the characters that populate his Table - is revealed as nothing but a hierarchy of forms, draped in Western fashion. Interpreted against the city's backdrop, the overcoat is just another fancy façade within a form-obsessed society: just as Peter's orthographic reforms embellished the letters in a fancy European wardrobe, Petrovich has fashioned a modish overcoat for the empty letter Kako. Akakii's dramatic transformation - his alphabetic realization - is precipitated by the loss of his own "calligraphic clothing": first of the housecoat, then of the overcoat, so strongly associated with the outer form of language. The chain of loss in the tale - of housecoat, overcoat, life - accompanies a gradual shift from form to content: Akakii leaves the abstract world of convention, and is reborn into a new world of meaning. As numerous scholars have detailed, Gogol witnessed - and participated in - the birth of modern Russian authorship. His career bloomed at a time of unprecedented change in Russian literary culture, a period defined by expanding literacy, an explosion in print culture, a proliferation of written texts, and the development of a professional writing class.79 As the center of literary life moved beyond the salon, with its chummy relationship between the author and his elite readers, a new readership emerged: not the uniform, urbane salon audience of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, but a "broad, heterogeneous, far from uniformly sophisticated" group.80 These new literary circumstances brought concomitant hazards, both artistic and commercial : how could a professional man of letters continue to serve his muse while satisfying this new, unknown, multifarious audience?81 And how was an emergent author to square the "high mission of art with the profit motive of the market economy"?82 These tensions between poet and crowd, art and commerce, 79For more on Gogol and the emergence of print culture in Russia see William Mills Todd Ill's chapter on literary institutions in Fiction and Society in the Age of Pushkin, 45-105; Anne Lounsbery, Thin Culture , High Art: Gogol, Hawthorne, and Authorship in Nineteenth-Century Russia and America (Cambridge, MA, 2007), 1-31; Donald Fanger, "Gogol and his Reader," in Literature and Society in Imperial Russia, 1800-1914 , ed.

Perhaps the copyist represented Gogol's attempt to address the threat to author and art posed by the rise of print culture, and to "revalue" the artistic degradation of the print marketplace; after all, Akakii is a contented and capable copier who learns to raise his voice "for the first time in his life." At the same time, Akakii betrays his creator's anxiety a propos artistic imitation: the face of a copy clerk obscured by his own multiplying letters becomes emblematic of Gogol's own artistic insecurities - the creator dissolving within his own derivative production, any growing authority paid for with his life. Expanding this argument onto a broader stage, the specific anxieties surrounding the changing culture of authorship of the 1 820s and 1 830s also help explain why the alphabet craze spoke so loudly to Gogol and his fellow writers during this period. The two debates shared an identical time period and cast of characters, as well as a similar subject: the means and production of literary creation. It is possible that the shifting terrain of the literary landscape and the unstable social position of the writer led these authors to identify with the imperiled superfluous letters, moving them to speak up on their behalf. If mass publication offered writers a broader readership, it simultaneously seemed to upend the power balance between author and reader; the struggle to understand and satisfy a new reading audience was attended by a psychological loss of "authorship." In the face of this revolution in print culture, writers may have followed a conservative impulse to protect the "raw material" of their craft; defending Izhitsa thus became a reaction against 83Lounsbery, Thin Culture , 264. 84Ibid., 7. 85Scholars have long noted that Gogol "made lavish appropriations of themes, ideas, and styles from his predecessors. His works alone would enable us to deduce much of the history of Russian literature, along with its borrowings from the West" (Robert A. Maguire, Exploring Gogol [Stanford, 1994], 168). On a more personal level, the young author inflated the extent of his indebtedness to Pushkin, naming the older poet as his inspiration and guide, and claiming to have inherited from him the outlines of both Dead Souls and The Inspector General (Maguire, Exploring , 111-12; Moeller-Sally, Gogol's Afterlife, 7). In effect, Gogol posed as a copier in order to legitimize his position as author. Throughout his career, meanwhile, he displayed apprehension over his art's perceived derivativeness, going out of his way to assert his uniqueness in Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends ; as Maguire summarizes, "As late as 1847 ... we see evidence of a persistent anxiety about what we have called imitation" (Exploring, 168). 86Lounsbery, Thin Culture , 264.</page><page sequence="21">Како сделан Акакий 207 the uncertainties of print, a way to reinstate the authority that had shifted from poet to crowd.87 Certainly, in the case of "The Overcoat," it is the tongue-tied Akakii's intimate relationship with these letters that rescues him, sparking an evolution from copier to creator. The animation of his beloved, duplicated buki - their penetration from his skin to his soul - instills in Akakii the content and meaning-making capacity that he earlier lacked. Here the task of the titular councilor is cast as an analogue of the writer's activity: at some point in the mysterious process, duplication leads to true creation.88 Gogol viewed copying as a vital part of his own creative process, and claimed to recopy his stories eight times: "only after the eighth rewrite - and always in my own hand - does the work take on a final artistic finish and become a pearl of creation.89 Eventually, Gogol's letters take on a life of their own, empowering both themselves and their author: "In the process you will notice that as your style gains in power and your sentences take on polish and refinement, your hand will also seem to grow stronger: "the letters will be set down more firmly ( tverzhe ) and decisively."90 Likewise, Akakii's lovingly reduplicated letters awaken and reinforce their maker: they fly from their manuscripts, fill the musty air of the capital, and finally etch themselves on the body of their creator, strengthening his character (On sdelalsia ... dazhe tverzhe kharakterom ).91 The living letters of Akakii's copying thus provide a key to reading "The Overcoat": against the backdrop of Petersburg's endlessly generated documents, as we have seen, the letters of the scribe's manuscripts spring to life; their flight from folio to freedom shows Akakii a passage out of the textual prison he inhabits. Indeed, set against the predetermined text of the city itself, the lively letters of "The Overcoat" offer a sort of dynamic, performative countertext to Peter's ossified one. 87As an interesting side note, it is worth comparing the peculiar fetishization of Cyrillic characters in the 1 820s and 1 830s with the orthographic crazes of other eras. On the whole, the literature of embodied letters seems to proliferate in the decades following major orthographic reform. In the eighteenth century, the convention of personifying alphabet characters was likely a reaction to Peter's all-encompassing reforms, the orthographic and bureaucratic branches of which were twined in the public imagination. With literary luminaries like Lomonosov and Sumarokov weighing in on opposing sides of Peter's civil script, the "alphabetic" works by Lomonosov, Fonvizin, and Kantemir read like a literary extension of their responses to the Petrine revolution. (For an account of Sumarokov's antireformist position see Levitt, "The Barbarians among Us," 53-67; for Lomonosov's more congenial view of the Petrine reforms, refer to footnote 68.) The decades following the Revolution of 1917 likewise saw a renaissance of living alphabet characters, as writers responded to the socio- orthographic engineering: in Zamiatin's We (1921), the citizens of the totalitarian OneState are identified by a mix of Cyrillic and Latin letters, and in Tynianov's Lieutenant Kizhe (1927), a spelling error is conferred rank and lives out an eventful existence in the Russian bureaucracy. The absence of a precipitating orthographic event in early nineteenth-century Russia suggests that the movement may have arisen, rather, in response to events in the political or cultural sphere. This notion is consistent with the reading presented here, in which authorial angst over changes in the literary culture of the day found reflection in this war over letters (which represent, after all, the very building blocks of literary production). 88This connection between the scribe and his creator is reinforced alphabetically: as one anonymous reviewer pointed out, the double К of Akakii (ка-ка) recalls the acoustic duplication (го-го) at the heart of the author's family name; also note that, phonetically, К represents the unvoiced counterpart of the voiced letter Г. 89Reported in the 1872 memoirs of N.
