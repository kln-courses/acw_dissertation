Paris: Societe d'Edition "Les Belles Lettres," 1971. Pp. xi, 402. F 45. This book ranges widely, yet in considerable detail, over the history of Greek philosophy and theology from Plato and Aristotle to the early church fathers. M. Pepin's scholarship is well founded, detailed and comprehensive, and he uses it well to support his points. His basic attempt is to explicate how the ancient world viewed God and man and this is what the title would indicate. But one might well object that this has been done many times before and probably need not be done again. However, this book approaches these topics from an interesting and enlightening point of view. Pepin wants to show how the views of man and God are interrelated and interdependent, so that two ideas are developed side by side in his book. The first is that God is often viewed in human terms; God is a human being made divine. But Pepin also wants to show that there are other views in the history of Greek thought whereby man is considered to be a little God. Thus the themes of his book are the anthropomorphic theologies and the theomorphic anthropologies of the Greeks. In his introductory section, he traces the interpretations and influences of fragment 62 of Heraclitus ("Mortal immortals, immortal mortals,...."), giving a careful examination of its Orphic connotations. His history of the influence of this fragment is well worked out and extensive, ending with Hippolytus and Clement of Alexandria. The main body of the book is divided into two parts. The first contains an analysis of Plato's First Alcibiades and a detailed history of the influence of that dialogue on subsequent Greek thought. The most important part of the First</page><page sequence="2">244 THE CLASSICAL WORLD FEBRUARY 1974 Alcibiades, in Pepin's opinion, is the thesis that man is essentially a soul only temporally inhabiting a mortal and inferior body. Pepin carefully traces the influence of this notion on Aristotle (particularly the earlier works), Philo, Plutarch and Plotinus, as well as its influence on Stoic anthropology in Cicero and in the early church fathers. Such a procedure, however, is open to the objection that Plato's thought and influence are being treated from the limited point of view of a single dialogue. Although Pepin makes copious references to other dialogues (without much attempt to interpret them, however), his focus on the First Alcibiades causes some difficulties. This does not invalidate his work, but it does require that his views be supplemented by additional perspectives. The second part of the book deals with Aristotle's doctrine of God, in particular the relations between God and the human intellect, and also includes long chapters on the fragmentary dialogues, On Prayer and On Philosophy. Pepin's work on Aristotle's theology is aptly complex and can serve as an important antidote to the usual rather simplified accounts. In this reviewer's judgment, Pepin tends to over- Platonize Aristotle, but his work does show some important Platonic influences not only on the earlier Aristotelian dialogues but also on some of the important works of Aristotle's maturity. But, as with his work on Plato, there is an overemphasis on particular Aristotelian works, in this case the fragmentary dialogues for which the evidence tends to be slight and difficult to interpret. In spite of the difficulties mentioned above, Pepin's book is well worth reading and is a useful contribution to the history of Greek thought.
