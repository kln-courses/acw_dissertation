Tomb painting at Woohyun-ri</page><page sequence="2">Exhibition of Korean Art ROM May 7 through June I5 the exhibition of Masterpieces of Korean all; Art will be held at the Museum of Fine Arts. Never before has the Ameri- can public had such an opportunity for appraising the arts of Korea on so grand a scale. Whether the objects be the early metal work in gold of royal crowns and a girdle from the 5th to 6th century, sculptures in gilt bronze of the 6th to 7th century when Buddhism attained a creative maximum, types of celadon ware which are uniquely Korean and which are the most voluminous expression of the Koryo period (9I8-I392), or paintings from the Yi dynasty which ruled from I392 to I9IO, these are, in fact, of such rarity and quality that each medium of expression may be- come a new field of discovery for those who are artistically minded. The present writer, if he may be forgiven a few reminiscences, went to Korea to make the selection in the autunm of i956 in company with Alan Priest, Curator of Far Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Our friend, Dr. Chewon Kim, Director of the National Museum of Korea, gave us his wholehearted assistance. It was not an easy matter for war-tom Korea to provide us with the kind of help we needed. When we arrived in Seoul we found that the whole of the Duksoo Palace Museum of Fine Arts was devoted to an exhibition of Atoms for Peace and the contents of this great museum collection had been sent away as a security measure. Other problems were also immediately apparent. Because of the division of Korea no objects from North Korea were available. We found one exception, the gold buckle, excavated at Sogam-ni near P'yongyang from a tomb of the Ist to 2nd cen- tury A.D. when that part of North Korea and adjacent parts of Manchuria across the present border formed the Chinese province of Lo-lang. This immensely impor- tant dragon-decorated buckle reveals the ultimate Chinese foundation of Korean art. Descendants of this dragon appear in the decorations of other tombs in North Korea such as the great wall paintings at Woohyun-ri (Fig. i),' also near P'yongyang. Frescoed walls, being permanently fixed in the tombs they decorate, must go unrep- resented in an exhibition of original works. Our first side trip was to Kyongju, the ancient capital of the Unified Silla dynasty (668-93 5). Here at the temple of Pulguk-sa we saw two life-sized gilt bronze statues of seated figures of the Buddhas Amita and Vairocana. These statues, 8th century I9</page><page sequence="3">Silla, contemporary with the T'ang dynasty in China and with the Nara period in Japan, were obviously works of major importance in the history of Korean art. Un- fortunately, we were to discover that their weight and the narrowness of the temple doorways would make it impossible to include these in the exhibition. Later we were to find that the Amita of the temple of Pusok-sa (Fig. 2)&gt;, which dates from the ioth century and shows the developments of sculpture in the Koryo period, would also not be available, in this case because the medium, wood with a painted layer of clay, was too delicate to stand the dangers of packing and travel. Just above Pulguk-sa is the artificial cave temple of Sogul-am with stone sculptures of Shakyamuni, his disciples, and other divinities, carved in relief sometime about the middle of the 8th century. Once more there was no possibility of getting any of the reliefs for the exhibition. But if none of these monumental carvings could be moved, we did see in the Kyongju Museum small stoneware figurines of mounted horsemen. These we selected to help bring to life the period of the 5th to 6th centuries when gold crowns were being buried in royal tombs. The gold crowns themselves we did not see until we reached Pusan on the south- ern tip of Korea, and here we discovered that nearly all the treasures formerly housed in Seoul at the Duksoo Palace Museum and in the National Museum, were stored away in boxes against the uncertainty of the times, a feeling of danger ever present in the thoughts of the divided nation. On the first day of our stay in Pusan we were shown objects in gold. Never had we vividly realized the richness which has come out of the tombs at Kyongju, dating from the 5th to 6th century. In the most famous of these, the Gold Crown Tomb, were found: a crown fashioned from sheet gold measuring seventeen and a half inches in height; a pair often-inch long pendants, probably attached to the hair rather than to the ears themselves; a girdle made of openwork sheet gold; seventeen pend- ants of gold, some with finials in glass or jade; supplementary ear pendants; a dozen bracelets; a dozen rings; five gold bowls; and what are probably coffin ornaments, also of gold. All these are included in the exhibition. But found in the same tomb were also blue glass vases which must have been imported from the West across Central Asia, gilt bronze tripod vessels with long handles, fragments of lacquer dishes, gilt bronze shoes, "curved" jewels made ofjade, jasper, carnelian, and rock- crystal, swords with gold and silver ornaments, gilt bronze armor plates, saddles and stirrups. The gilt bronze openwork of the stirrups is inlaid with beetle wings. This same method of decoration gave its name to the Tamamushi (literally, jewel insect) Shrine, one of the famous shrines at the 7th century temple of Horyil-ji in Japan. The impression which one gets from this wealth of material is of an age rich in gold, when wealth and culture were rising to new achievements, and when trade both reached backward towards China and outward towards Japan. That many of the things of life were still at a fairly primitive level is apparent, if the single piece of Old Silla stoneware in the exhibition is recognized as of the same period as the gold crowns. 20</page><page sequence="4">2.

They belong to the latter part of the Old Silla dynasty, per- haps late in the 6th or earlY 7th century and both were executed at a moment in the history of Buddhist art when linear rhythms were esteemed more than realism. in these, the mystery of divinity speaks symbolically in the silent language of art forms, rather than sentimentally in more anthropomorphic representations. A comparison of the Maitreya in the Duksoo Palace Museum of Fine Arts with a wooden figure of Maitreya in the temple of K6ryii-ji in Japan (Figs. 3 and 4) 3 is most revealing. How can one explain this similarity e Was the wooden image sent from Korea, was it made by a Korean in Japan, or does Korean influence explain the likeness? What one can be certain of is that Buddhism came first to Japan from Korea, a fact documented both by literary records and artistic monuments. 22~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="6">3.

Fortunately, most of the finer pieces had already been published, so that we could ask to see par- ticular objects of a quality hardly realized in collections or museums in the West. Our pleasure must have been similar to that of Hsii Ching, a Chinese who accom- panied a mission to Korea in II24 and who reported back to the emperor of China on some of the wonderful things seen in Korea. Among these he mentions incense burners, "also of the color of the kingfisher, shaped like a lion, the crouching animal being represented on the lid with an upturned lotus leaf for its support. This is one of the most ingenious and beautiful of all their ceramic vessels."4 Figures 5 and 6 will give some idea of the ingenious sculptured pieces which so amazed the Chinese of the Sung dynasty. Another type of Korean ceramics, yet a further example of Korean skill and in- genuity, is found in the so-called inlaid wares. Figure 7, a bottle shape with a lidded spout which must have had a special Buddhist significance, has a decoration of ducks, willow trees and lotus plants executed in white. To achieve the effect he desired, the potter had to incise his design into the body clay while it was still soft, and to fill 24</page><page sequence="8">s.

In the sprinkler or water-pourer the design is white save for dots of black for the eyes of the ducks. Korean pottery of this kind shows an amazing variety of surface decoration, quiet in color contrasts and rich in floral motifs, the favorite being the small wild chrysanthemum. Still more rare are ceramic pieces in which copper has been used as an ingredient for producing a different tone of color. The major decoration of the vase (Fig. 8) consists of three floral sprays in which the incised lines are filled with white and black slips, but in addition portions of the petals have been painted with a copper oxide. This vase is dated to the I2th to I3th century and precedes any example of a copper red used pictorially by Chinese potters. The above ceramic pieces are all from the Koryo dynasty. In the Yi dynasty in the isth to i6th century a wine bottle, such as Figure 9, represents an entirely new de- velopment of the old technique. The all-over design is as geometric as a mesh, and yet, because the bottle is handmade with a design impressed on the surface by small stamps, the surface possesses a human informality rather than a stiff mechanical qual- ity. The simplicity, severity, and abstraction achieved here are qualities often sought for in the standards of taste of the 20th century. The productions of the potters of ancient Korea stand by themselves in the ceramic wonders of the Far East. The green tone of their celadons is soothing rather than brilliant, their slip-filled decorations reveal a supreme instinct for space relationships on a curved surface, and their classic shapes may be ranked amongst the masterpieces of the handicraft of man. But if one wonders why so much of the exhibit of Korean Masterpieces is devoted to ceramics, the answer is very simple. Korea has so frequently been a battlefield for warring armies that the survival of works of art has been exceptionally low. Korea is a peninsula, a country at no time great in wealth or population. It has suffered re- peated invasions by Chinese armies. The Mongols in their aim to destroy Japan overran the land in the I3th century. In the i5th century when the Japanese war lord, Hideyoshi, sought to conquer China his chief result was the ruination of Korea. One possible benefit to the Japanese was the importation of hundreds of Korean potters toJapan, an act which laid the foundation for the development of a porcelain industry in Japan. In the I7th century Korea befriended the waning Ming dynasty in China and in consequence was twice invaded by Manchu armies before the establishment of the Manchu or Ch'ing dynasty in China in I644. It is hard to find historic buildings of great age in Korea. The preserver of her art treasures has been her soil, and from her tombs have come forth a succession of objects dependent in part on the social position of the person buried and in part on the burial customs of the period. Some objects,5 like the two small gold Buddhas from the site of Hwangbok-sa temple, were actually discovered between the roofing layers of a stone pagoda, safely hidden away till modem times. These last are, by the way, the only gold images made in the Far East which have been preserved. Almost all of the objects so far considered, perhaps with the exception of a few pieces of sculpture, have been excavated in the 20th century. Most of these were found by Japanese archeologists working since I9IO, have been handsomely published, and have been studied by a variety of scholars. 26</page><page sequence="10">9.

Collections of Korean art in American museums may have a few Buddhist pictures or a few ancestor por- traits, but these would be the work of traditional craftsmen, not the esteemed work of men of genius. When the walls of the large rooms where we were making our selection at Pusan were hung and rehung with paintings, we were faced with great difficulties. As Westerners, we were still unfamiliar with this material. Most of the older paintings were in a condition which in itself would preclude their shipment. And for the later period, when Korea must have been rather isolated from Chinese influences, the style of their artists tended to be either strongly national or highly individual. The first of these tendencies is exemplified in landscape in the works of the artist Chong S6n (I676-I759) and in genre by Sin Yun-bok (b. I7S8-?). Figure IO shows a kind of picnic party with music out in the country.6 In this album the customs and costumes of the people are portrayed with great skill and charm. However, the painting which seems to the writer to sum up the best of this late period in Korean art is the long scroll called Mountains and Rivers Without End.7 Figure ii illustrates a section of this famous scroll by Yi In-mun (I746-I825). It is a lively panorama of mountain and sea, of hamlet and boat. In the case of each of these artists three examples of their works have been chosen so that a particular style would become more easily apparent. On our return to Seoul after some ten days of work at Pusan we were delighted to find that the Korean officials had packed all the material which we had selected and were engaged in exhibiting it for us in the National Museum of Korea and in the Duksoo Palace Museum of Fine Arts. This was of great benefit in that it enabled us to compare what we were to borrow from private collections in Seoul with what we had already selected from the government collections. Just before ending our trip to Korea we were honored in being asked to call on President Syngman Rhee, and we realized then how his official interest had prepared the way and made it pos- sible for us to borrow for exhibition abroad so many of Korea's masterpieces in varied fields of art.
