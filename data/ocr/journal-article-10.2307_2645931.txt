<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES IN THE WORK OF FERNANDO ORTIZ MARTA MORENO VEGA Baruch College During the slave trade, enslaved Africans and their descendants in Cuba developed the Yoruba-based religion La Regla de Ocha, pop- ularly known as Santeri'a. Cuba, driven by plantation economics late into the 19th century, depended on the forced servitude of enslaved Africans and their descendants even after slavery was abolished in 1888. Cuban plantation owners tenaciously resisted pressure from the British to abolish enslavement, becoming one of the last countries in the Western Hemisphere to do so. Although a law was passed on July 29, 1880, to abolish enslavement in Cuba, the statute instituted a period of 8-year tutelage for enslaved Afri- cans, officially ending slavery in 1888 (Knight, 1970, p. 177). The continuous infusion of negros de nacion, Africans born on the continent, invigorated the memory of sacred traditional African praxes into the existing population of enslaved and freed Africans in Cuba. Among the ethnic groups brought to Cuba in the latter part of the 19th century were the Yoruba people of West Africa. Thornton explains that although enslavers tried to diversify their ships to deter rebellions, generally, the Africans aboard represented ethnic groups from similar national groupings, which served to maintain cultural bonds in the New World. Thornton (1992) notes, These circumstances operated to ensure that most slaves would have no shortage of people from their own nation with whom to communicate and perhaps to share elements of common culture. These groupings of slaves served as a base from which many ele- JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES, Vol. 31 No. 1, September 2000 39-50 ? 2000 Sage Publications, Inc. 39</page><page sequence="2">40 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 ments of African culture could be shared, continued and developed in America and perhaps even transmitted into the next generation. (p. 197) Murphy (1994) attests that the Yorubas in Cuba were able to maintain their sacred beliefs in the religious practices of Santerfa: "Like the candomble of Bahia, Cuban Santerfa has its origins among the Yoruba priests and priestesses of the orishas who were enslaved at the close of the eighteenth and the first decades of the nineteenth centuries" (p. 81). Murphy further explains that Santeria evolved as parallelisms developed between Yoruba traditionalists and the Roman Catholic Church. Murphy (1994) describes the following: They developed multiple levels of discourse to organize their heter- ogeneous religious experience, referring, in more public and secular contexts, to the Yoruba orishas by the Spanish word santos. Altered to the energetic devotions to these santos practiced by African Cubans, outsiders labeled their religion santerfa the way of the saints. (p. 81) According to Barnet (1997), the investigations of Fernando Ortiz provided an in-depth understanding of the transcultural and hybrid forms that Yoruba traditions underwent in Cuba (pp. 85-87). The work of Ortiz established a base that allowed comparisons between other Yoruba-based systems in the Americas with those of Cuba. Comparing the attributes of the Yoruba orisha-divinity Obbatala, Barnet (1997) provides an example of the parallelism between the work of Pierre Verger in Brazil and that of Ortiz in Cuba: "Accord- ing to Verger, he [Obbatala] is the duality earth/sea and earth/sky. ... * This duality is represented objectively in a calabash cut in two halves: the upper one, the sky, is Obbatala; the lower one, the earth, is Odua." Of him, Ortiz has written, "Obbatala is the celestial vault or superior gourd of the two in which the sphere was split, gtiiro or calabash of the world." The work of Ortiz and his col- leagues provided the fundamental text for New World Yorubas to learn the cultural traditions of their forebears. For the Puerto Rican</page><page sequence="3">Vega / INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES 41 and African American communities in New York, the work of Fernando Ortiz and his protege Lydia Cabrera provided the texts that invigorated the ancestral and race memory of these urban diaspora communities. ABOUT THE ARTICLE To date, little research has been done to understand the historical environment that created the receptive conditions for the growth of the religion in New York. It is the objective of this article to focus on the synergy that helped create a receptive environment for the growth of La Regla de Ocha in New York. It is evident that one of the influencing figures in the growth of Santerfa in New York was Fernando Ortiz. Ortiz's influence can be felt through the work of traditional leaders, scholars, and artists that he worked with and nurtured. INTERLOCKING HISTORICAL CONTEXT-THE WORK OF DUBOIS, DIGGS, HERSKOVITS, AND ORTIZ The concurrent investigations of African American scholar W.E.B. DuBois and Ortiz in the early 1900s provide an initial beginning point. The work of these scholars, who were interested in the persistence of African praxes in the Americas, was the uniting force. These two scholars and their proteges were links in a chain of individuals that included musicians, traditional leaders, and schol- ars who fostered a receptive environment for the eventual growth of La Regla de Ocha in New York. This article seeks to acknowledge their contributions and the centrality of Fernando Ortiz in the process. In 1903, DuBois (1989), author of The Souls of Black Folk, docu- mented the aesthetic threads that Africans in the United States retained from their African root cultures. Concurrently, Ortiz was documenting the practices of the diverse African ethnic groups in</page><page sequence="4">42 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 Cuba. In 1906, he had published Hampa Afrocubana, Los Negros Brujos, Apuntes para un Estudio de Etnograft Criminal, a study associating Africanisms with criminality. Eventually, Ortiz changed his perspective, acknowledging the cultural and intellec- tual value, strength, and contributions of African descendants to Cuba's national identity. The separate investigations and documen- tation of pioneering scholars were brought together in African American journalist-scholar Ellen Irene Diggs's (1944) disserta- tion for the University of Havana, titled Fernando Ortiz y Fernandez La Vida y La Obra. Diggs acknowledged that the new anthropological investiga- tions of pioneers such as Ortiz proved that Africans and their descendants were not inherently less intelligent, which was the popular belief at the time. In her postscript, Diggs (1944) stated, Recent trends of investigation have emphasized the study of primi- tive culture and have led to a wide realization of the essential like- nesses in the development of early human culture and emphasis on the fact that difference is no proof of race inferiority or cultural limi- tations. (p. 108) In the late 1920s, anthropologist Melville Herskovits's works also contributed to dispelling the prevalent notion that "Africaness" was equivalent to inferiority and cultural limitations. Herskovits's studies, concurrent with those of anthropologists in other countries, documented a global philosophy and system of sacred beliefs that established and affirmed a continuum among African practices in the Americas. Fernando Ortiz of Cuba, Gonzalo Aguirre Beltran of Mexico, Nina Rodriques of Brazil, and others formed an interna- tional network investigating the cultures of Africans and their descendants in their particular geographical areas as well as con- necting their findings to other locations. Important to the study of African diaspora cultures was that these pioneers eventually established institutions in which they were able to do comparative studies on African continuities in the Americas. Clearly, Ortiz was central to the formation and work of</page><page sequence="5">Vega / INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES 43 these organizations. Equally important to the work of these schol- ars was that they were important catalysts, nurturing future genera- tions of researchers and promulgators of the importance of African diaspora studies. The dissertation and journalistic work of Diggs again provides an example. CONNECTING AFRICAN AMERICA, CUBA, AND THE DIASPORA Diggs's dissertation focused on Ortiz was dedicated to DuBois. Her dedication reads as follows: "Al Doctor W. E. Burghardt DuBois, filosofo, maestro, guiay amigo [to Doctor W. E. Burghardt DuBois, philosopher, teacher, guide and friend]." In her disserta- tion, the introduction written by DuBois is titled "The Revelation of Saint Orgne the Damned." The paragraph focused on the issue of race. Apparently, for Diggs, it established a natural connection between the thinking of DuBois and Ortiz. The Revelation of Saint Orgne the Damned Saint Orgne stood facing the morning and asked: What is this life I see? Is the dark damnation of color, real? Or simply mine own imag- ining? Can it be true that souls wrapped in black velvet have a des- tiny different from those swathed in white satin or yellow silk, when all these coverings are fruit of the same worm, and threaded by the same hands? Or must I, ignoring all seeming difference, rise to some upper realm where there is no color nor race, sex, wealth nor age, but all men stand equal in the sun? (DuBois, 1989) In a newspaper article written for the Pittsburgh Courier in 1943, Diggs (1943) announced the creation of the International Institute for Afro-American Studies in Mexico and listed the mem- bers. They included Melville Herskovits (European American, the United States), Alain Locke (African American, the United States), Arthur Ramos (Brazil), Jorge A. Vivo (Mexico), and Fernando Ortiz (Cuba). Collaboration between the scholars and their proteges established a circular sharing of information that is evi- dent in other situations.</page><page sequence="6">44 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 CONNECTIONS-HERSKOVITS AND ORTIZ The relationship of Ortiz and Herskovits allowed them to recom- mend and refer exceptional students to each other, helping them expand upon their own investigations. Herskovits referred Kather- ine Dunham, a student of anthropology, to Ortiz when she decided to expand her comparative study of African religious dances and rituals in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. Ortiz, in turn, introduced Dunham to a range of traditional reli- gious artists that eventually were included in her international tour- ing dance company that presented her anthropological studies in concert staged musicals. In Dunham's (1946) production, Kather- ine Dunham in Bal Negre, the influence of Ortiz was evident in the programming. Valdes, a Cuban, was the musical director and com- poser of various dance productions. The program notes indicate, "Ylenko-Ylembe, written by the brilliant young composer-conduc- tor, Gilberto Valdes, is a vocal and orchestral combination which emphasizes unrestrained Afro-Cuban themes." The program also included "Rhumba," "Naiiigo" by Valdez, "Son a Cuban Slave Lament," "La Comparsa" by Lecuona, and "Shango'," a tribute to the Yoruba warrior divinity of thunder and lightning. DUNHAM AND ORTIZ CONNECT Based on my research, it is probable that the first Yoruba-derived ritual bata drums brought to New York were those of the Katherine Dunham Company. In a photograph taken of Dunham in Cuba in 1947, the legendary traditional drummer Jesus Perez, known as "Manos Prodigiosas," is showing her a set of bata drums. Accord- ing to Dunham, it was Ortiz who introduced her to Perez. She com- missioned Perez to construct a set of bata drums for her company. The bata set is now on exhibition in the Katherine Dunham Museum in east St. Louis. Two of the drummers used by Ortiz for his lecture demonstra- tions were Francisco Aguabella and Julito Basabe Collazo. They were later hired by Dunham and toured with the Dunham Company until 1954. In the movie titled Mambo (1955), both Collazo and</page><page sequence="7">Vega / INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES 45 Aguabella appear playing drums as does African Cuban vocalist Xiomara Alfaro. The opening scene of the movie featured African Cuban vocalist Alfaro chanting to the orishas and drummers Collazo and Francisco accompanying her. Here again, the cross- fertilization of artists functioning as popular performers and in underground traditional ceremonies continued to blur the lines between the sacred and secular, bringing attention to La Regla de Ocha in different settings. In an interview with me, African Cuban master drummer Mongo Santamaria noted that many of the Puerto Rican and Cuban musi- cians would go to the Dunham school after their "gigs" at the Palla- dium nightclub to jam with the Dunham musicians during their rehearsals. Mongo explained that the Dunham Company was the only group (M. Santamaria, personal communication, October, 1994) that had the traditional ritual African Cuban instruments in the city. The influence of Ortiz continued to ripple in the presence of Aguabella and Collazo in New York City. Both these drummers played in popular orchestras introducing the ritual music and Afri- can derived instruments. Mongo noted that he introduced Collazo to Tito Puente, who then began to incorporate Yoruba ritual chants and music into the Puente orchestra. During this period, Mongo indicated that he held a public cele- bration in 1956 to the orisha Shango at the Palladium nightclub. One of the featured dancers was Collazo, who performed in both the Yoruba and Abakua sections. Ortiz's recommendation of Aguabella and Collazo influenced the growth of a nascent La Regla de Ocha community in New York City. After their performances, the drummers often attended and participated in ritual ceremonies in Harlem. In an interview, Collazo recalled that at the first ceremony that he and Aguabella attended, few people knew the chants (J. B. Collazo, personal com- munication, July 1994). He recalled that the African Cuban musi- cians Arsenio Rodriguez and his brother Kiki, descendants of Congo slaves, were playing congas at the celebration. When Aguabella and Collazo started singing the ritual Yoruba chants, everyone turned around in amazement and tried to follow their lead</page><page sequence="8">46 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 because very few of the participants knew them. The ceremony was at the home of the policy numbers runner Willie El Bolitero in December of 1954. El Bolitero was Puerto Rican and had initiated into the religion in Cuba as a priest of Shang6. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF LA REGLA DE OCHA IN NEW YORK-WILFREDO LAM AND FERNANDO ORTIZ Important to the popularity of the imagery of African Cuban reli- gious iconography in New York was the work of African Chinese Cuban Wilfredo Lam. Lam attended religious ceremonies with his friends Ortiz and Lydia Cabrera. The investigations and writings of Cabrera, Ortiz's protege, have served as important texts to initiates in New York on the history and practices of La Regla de Ocha. Here again, Ortiz is an important factor in nurturing and influ- encing the imagery of La Regla de Ocha in New York. Historian Herzberg (1996) notes the following: "When Lam returned to Cuba at the end of 1941, a small group of Cuban intellectuals was actively exploring Afro-Cuban history, folklore, literature, music and dance" (p. 164). Fernando Ortiz and his colleagues and prot6ges were at the center of the Black studies and arts movement. Lam, a member of the surrealist movement, which was grounded in the spiritual world, brought an African Cuban worldview steeped in La Regla de Ocha (Herzberg, 1996, p. 151). By 1942, the major galleries in New York were exhibiting Lam's work. The work of Lam reflected the cosmology that was part of his African Cuban cultural experience, using the images that reflected the spirits and orishas. In describing Lam's work, Herzberg (1996) notes the fol- lowing: "The anthropomorphic nature of Afro-Cuban orishas is a principal theme in any number of Lam's works in the 1940s. Two deities most often depicted are Ellegua and Ogun both of whom retained their primacy from the African to the Cuban context" (p. 156). In our interview, Dunham explained that Lam often attended the Boule Blanc events at her school (W. Lam, personal communica- tion, June 1994). These events attracted artists that included Ernesto Lecuona, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Wilfredo Lam, and oth-</page><page sequence="9">Vega / INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES 47 ers. Here again, we can trace the interconnecting threads that reflect the coming together of individuals, associates of Ortiz, who were interested in African traditions and, most important, African reli- gious themes. Lam's friendship with Ortiz and Cabrera clearly placed him in the circle of the intellectuals studying Black cultures in Cuba, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Lam's childhood ritual experiences and his attendance at rituals with Ortiz and Cabrera, coupled with the international influence of his work, placed the orishas in a global environment. CUBA Y PUERTO RICO SON: FERNANDO ORTIZ AND RICARDO ALEGRIA In 1952, Ortiz (1954) wrote the prologue, "Los Diablitos Negros de Puerto Rico" (The Little Black Devils of Puerto Rico), for the publication La Fiesta de Santiago Apostol en Loiza Aldea, by Ricardo E. Alegria. Ortiz traced the history of the "Diablitos Negros" to the Iberian Peninsula before Columbus's accidental landing in the Caribbean. Noting the presence of Diablitos through- out the Spanish-speaking diaspora, Ortiz (1954) commends the research of anthropologist Alegrfa for documenting and focusing attention on the disappearing African influences of this tradition in Puerto Rico (p. xiv). Ortiz identified the design of the masks used in the Fiesta de Los Santiagos as appearing to have been influenced by Africans from Guinea. Likening the ceremonies to El Espiritu Santo in Lofza, Puerto Rico to those of the cabildos of the Arards of Cuba, Ortiz wove together the African legacies of Puerto Rico, Brazil, Vene- zuela, Haiti, and other global communities. In an interview in Puerto Rico, Alegrfa noted that it was Ortiz who introduced him to the possibility that the Catholic saint, Santi- ago Matamoros, could be representative of the Yoruba and Dahomean god of war Oguin and Zarabanda of the Congos (R. Alegria, personal communication, July 1994). Ortiz also relates that in Haiti, Oguin was the god of independence and in the form of San Pedro, the patron saint of Santiago de Cuba. His work docu-</page><page sequence="10">48 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 mented that Africans in the diaspora had appropriated the Catholic saint for the protection of their African divinities. Ortiz's influence is evident in Alegria's (1956) "The Fiesta of St. James The Apostle in Loiza, Puerto Rico." Of the African cultures represented among the Negroes who were brought to Puerto Rico, the Yoruba culture appears to have predominated. In the Yoruba religion Shango, a god whose attributes are very similar to those of Santiago Matamoros (killer of Moors), is an important figure. Shang6 is the god of war and thunderbolt: "The similarity between the attributes of the African god and the Christian Saint is such that it could well have led to a fusion of the two conceptions among the Negro population of Loiza" (Alegria, 1956, p. 126). The accessibility of Ortiz undoubtedly provided Alegria the opportunity to see his research of African traditions in Puerto Rico within a broader global perspective, thereby allowing him to deepen his understanding of the persistence of African traditions on the island. THE NEXT GENERATION: LOUIS BAUZO As a younger generation of musicians grew out of the pioneer orchestras of Frank Machito Grillo, Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria and Mario Bauza, their desire to learn the rhythms to the divinities of Africa grew, according to musician Louis Bauzo. In an interview with Bauzo, one of the most respected contempo- rary traditional drummers, he noted that it was the books of Ortiz that provided the text, illustrations, and scores that the new genera- tion of drummers learned from. Ortiz's Los Bailes y El Teatro del Los Negros en el Folklore De Cuba (The Dances and Theater of the Blacks in Cuban Folklore) became their bible (L. Bauzo, personal communication, April 1995). The unspoken rivalry between Cuban and Puerto Rican musi- cians did not provide a space for learning. Most Puerto Rican and African American musicians attended ceremonies in which pio- neer Julito Collazo and his group were playing, trying to learn the rhythms. Intent on creating a space to learn, the Puerto Rican drum- mers formed the Drummers Collective. Bauzo indicated that listen-</page><page sequence="11">Vega / INTERLOCKING AFRICAN DIASPORA CULTURES 49 ing to the recordings of Mongo and reading the books of Ortiz allowed the Puerto Rican musicians to advance in their studies. PUERTO RICANS, CUBANS, AND AFRICAN AMERICANS CONNECT In my interview with Mongo, he showed me an album titled Katherine Dunham presents Drum Rhythms of Haiti, Cuba, and Brazil. The Singing Gods (Dunham, 1803), recorded in the early 1950s and featuring the work of Aguabella and Collazo. The liner notes state, "For a number of years Miss Dunham has been a close personal friend and admirer of Fernando Ortiz, outstanding Cuban folklorist, anthropologist and writer." On one of her visits to Cuba, Dunham saw Aguabella and Collazo working in a group that Ortiz had organized for the investigation and preservation of Cuban cult material. Aguabella and Collazo have become strongly integrated into the Dunham Company and are known to the capitals of the world for the subtlety and precision of their drumming and the intensity of their santos and naniigo songs. BACK TO THE BEGINNING The influence of the pionering work of Ortiz continues to influ- ence the growth of the religion in New York City. The developing community of initiates influenced by the civil rights and Black and Latino Power movements continued to look to the religion as the foundation for cultural and spiritual identity. The writings of Ortiz and his protege Cabrera provided the text from which the new gen- eration of initiates learned. The interconnections that existed among the many individuals that contributed to the growth of the religion in New York estab- lished a strong foundation for its continued growth. The evolution of the religion from Africa to the Americas has not been linear. Like the piecing together of a puzzle, it has been a process of bringing together individuals of varied interest around a similar vision. It is evident that the international reach of Ortiz was instrumental in identifying, sharing, and influencing the spread of the knowledge of La Regla de Ocha.</page><page sequence="12">50 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / SEPTEMBER 2000 REFERENCES Alegria, R.
