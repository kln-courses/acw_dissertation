<plain_text><page sequence="1">50 French Studies EARLY MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By Marianne J. Ailes, Wadham College, Oxford i. General ABHL, 75, Section in (27-31), deals with the Central Middle Ages (900-1200). BSSCLE, 11, includes a useful bibliography of recent and forthcoming publications on all matters concerning the crusades; a list of work in process and another of recently completed theses are also given. Medievales, 18, 1990, * Espaces de Moyen age; 19, 1990, * Liens de famille: Vivre et choisir sa parente; 20, Sagas et chroniques du Nord, contains, in addition to articles on the Northern chronicles, A. Bratu, 'L'ici-bas et l'au-dela en image: formes de representation de l'espace et du temps' (75-90), an iconographical study of heaven, hell, and purgatory in the later Middle Ages; of wider interest and greater controversy is 21, L'an mil: rhythmes et acteurs d'une croissance, which has a number of articles showing divers reactions to Guy Bois's book, La Mutation de Fan mil, and a reply by Bois. J. W. Baldwin, 'Five discourses on desire: sexuality and gender in northern France around 1200', Speculum, 69:797-819, examines examples of five very different genres with respect to their attitudes about sexuality and gender. The five writers are the theologian Peter the Chanter, one of the physicians who composed the Prose Salernitan Questions (written in northern France, not Salerno), Jean Bodel as a writer of fabliaux, Andreas Capellanus, and Jean Renart. Each is analysed in turn with due consideration being paid to the conventions of the genre. Jean Renart's work is examined in most detail. Points of agreement (e.g. the unacceptability of homosexuality) and of discord among the five are then brought out. B. points out that changes took place at the beginning of the 13 th c, with the Aristotelian model of the single seed in procreation becoming more dominant, which make the turn of the century a unique period in this respect. E. J. Benkov, 'Language and women from silence to speech', Wasserman, Sign, 245-65, examines the idea that female discourse was seen as a potential threat to the established order. B. looks first at ideals as set out in the didactic treatises and courtesy lit. and finds the ideal of speaking little but wisely. B. then shows the use made by fabliaux of these conventions, e.g. for comic ends, particularly in the use of sexual language and sometimes by a disassociation between the sign and the object, first with women as victims then with women as verbal manipulators. Finally, B. turns to women of higher social status in romance and fabliaux and women's use of deceptive language to cover up sin. R. E. Brown, 'Pregnancy in classical and medieval literature',</page><page sequence="2">Early Medieval Literature 5i Neophilologus, 75:321-26, is a brief analysis of the lack of pregnancy in medieval courtly lit., paying particular attention to Tristan and Isolde and the parallel with heroic lit. of the classical period, except when gods have relationships with mortal women. Ursula Ernst, *Studien zur altfranzosischen Vers-Legende (io.-Anfang 13. Jahrhunderts): Die Legende im Spannungsfeld von Chanson de gest und Roman, NY, Lang, 1989, 280 pp. A. Gamier, 'Themes et variations sur la pie dans le monde medieval', MA, 97: 77-81, looks at the presence and treatment of this bird in Latin and Old French texts incl. Conon de Bethune and Gautier de Coinci. Aron Gurevich, Medieval Popular-Culture: Problems of Belief, CUP, 275 pp., trans. Janos M. Bak and Paul A. Hollings worth, is a translation of the Russian text of 1981. It is of particular interest with regard to religious material and hagiography. The discussion is linked directly to Latin lit. but is relevant for an understanding of all medieval lit. Douglas Kelly, The Arts of Poetry and Prose, Turnhout, Brepols, 194 pp., is an evaluation and discussion of the genre, concentrating on the Latin sources but listing vernacular sources which are discussed in an important appendix (146-79). The main body of the book is useful for all medievalists in placing rhetoric in the context of the medieval outlook, e.g. philosophy, pedagogy, and artistry. Muriel Lahurie, La Folie au Moyen Age XF - XIIF siecles, Le Leopard d'Or, 308 pp. + 82 pi., is a detailed study looking first at supernatural madness (the possessed and the 'Fous de Dieu'), then at natural madness. Literary and iconographic stereotypes of madness are examined. The second part of the study looks at how feudal society dealt with madness. Literary models include Perceval and Yvain. Hagiography is an important source with saints as miracle workers discussed and listed comprehensively. B. A. Masters, 'The distribution, destruction and dislocation of authority in medieval literature and its modern derivatives', RR, 82:270-85, takes us back to an important recognition of the uniqueness of MSS, looking again at the whole problem of edited texts and the concept of an original author. The concept of auctoritas is looked at in respect not only of literary texts but also of the visual arts, which are taken to some degree as models for the literary texts. M. Moulis, '"Sang du cceur qui monte as yeulx faut larmes"', Le (Cuer', 225-32, after a brief survey of the different attributions of the heart in lit. (e.g. the Couronnement de Louis, Cliges, La Prise d'Orange, prose Lancelot), goes on to examine the relationship between courtly lit. and medical lit. around the concept of'illness of love' and the passion/humours/heart link. S. G. Nichols, 'Seeing food: an anthropology of ekphrasis and still life in classical and medieval examples', MLN, 106:818-51, is a detailed study of the subject through a variety of texts as part of an issue on 'cultural presentations of food'. C. Raynaud, La Violence au</page><page sequence="3">52 French Studies moyen age (XIIF-XV siecles, Le Leopard d'Or, 378 pp. + 87 pis, is an iconographical study of violence as depicted in the MSS of French vernacular historical writings. Many of these texts deal with subjects which are inherently violent. B. Ribemont,' "Le Cuer del Ventre li as trais": cceur arrache, cceur mange, cceur envole: un regard medico theologique sur quelques themes litteraires', Le (Cuer\ 344-61, examines the motifs and concepts of heart, soul, and spirit in the context of medical and theological writings. J. E. Salisbury, Medieval Sexuality: A Research Guide (Garland Medieval Bibliographies, 5), NY, Garland, 1990, 200 pp., provides a list of primary and secondary sources on the subject with a brief summary of the contents of each. The primary sources are divided into history, law, literature, and science. A. Taylor, 'The myth of the minstrel manuscript', Speculum, 66:43-73, subjects a number of MSS to scrutiny, questioning whether these are really 'working MSS'. The study incl. MSS containing chansons de geste, e.g. Digby 23, and Middle English romances. T. raises issues of our stereotype of the minstrel. He concludes that it is difficult, even meaningless, to attempt to distinguish minstrel MSS from library or commercial texts. C. Thornasset, 'La chevalerie et l'ostentation dans revocation de la fete', Symposion (Paderborn), 181-91, is a semantic study looking at lit. through the words fete and joie. Certain elements are seen as essential to evoke a festive atmosphere. The use of the words joie and fete is examined through a number of texts, mostly chansons de geste but also others, e.g. Robert de Clari and the Chatelaine de Vergy. First examined are informal occasions with a festive mood, then more organized fetes. T. concludes that the terms are virtually interchangeable. J.-J. Vincensini, 'Figure de l'imaginaire et figure de discours. Le motif du "cceur mange" dans la narration medievale', Le cCuer\ 439-59, is a wide-ranging anthropomorphic study. Michel Zink, Litterature fran qaise: le moyen age, Nancy U.P., 1990, is an introductory chronological study of Old French lit. The chapter division is by genres. As well as examining trends and texts, Z. explains such issues as the relationship between Latin and the vernacular and between written and oral. 2. Epic P. Bennett, 'Le refus d'aide, deni de justice', Actes (Barcelona), 53-64, studies the motif of the king who refuses to come to the aid of a vassal, beginning with Aliscans (which B. suggests in this case is closer to the common original than G2). The versions of Aliscans and G2 are compared. B. turns his attention to Garin le Loherin, then the Enfances Vivien. B. questions whether the motif in the E. V. is really a reflection of the attitude of the great feudatories but sets it in a quite different political context, that of the antagonism between Philippe Auguste</page><page sequence="4">Early Medieval Literature 53 and John of England. G. J. Brault, 'The religious content of the chansons de geste: some recent studies', Grigsby Vol., 175-86, reviews recent findings on the religious matter in chansons de geste. J. Flori, 4 "Pur eshalcier sainte crestiente." Croisade, guerre sainte et guerre juste dans les anciennes chansons de geste franchises', MA, 97:171? 88, examines the ethos of the chansons de geste in terms of what were the major characteristics of a crusade and whether these are found in the chansons de geste, showing that generally they are not. Religious motives are, however, clearly important in the chansons. F. shows the crusading elements present to be the struggle against the Saracens and the indulgences. F. looks at the integration of the values of a Holy War with an aristocratic ideal, serving God through the service of a monarch. A useful study applying the work of medieval crusade historians to the lit. E. A. Heinemann, 'Rythmes semantiques de la chanson de geste: types grammaticaux du vers et pulsions a la cesure', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 145-82, is to a large extent a synthesis of the work of Rychner and Zumthor, a recognition of the metrical and grammatical use of rhythm in chansons de geste. Rychner's classi fications of line structure and caesura are retouche. A detailed classification of lines or line-types by grammar is given. E. A. Heinemann, 'On the metric artistry of the chanson de geste', Olifant, 16:5?60, studies the art of repetition, looking at what H. calls 'disjunctive echoes', i.e. the use of formulae within a text, 'external echoes', i.e. formulae referring to outside the text, found in a number of chansons, 'consecutive echoes', in consecutive verses, and at the metric repetitions of verse and laisse. Four components of measure are also discerned: internal cohesion, length, position, and thrust. The analysis builds on, but does not much refer to, Rychner and nuances our understanding of the role of repetition and rhythm or metre in the chanson de geste. The analysis uses a number of chansons de geste but concentrates on the Charroi deNimes. M. Heintze, Konig, Held und Sippe: Untersuchungen zur Chanson de geste des 13. und 14. Jahrhunderts und ihrer Zyklenbildung (Studia Romanica, 76), Heidelberg, Winter, 724 pp., is a comprehensive study of the development of the chanson de geste in four parts: 1, on the career of the hero, birth, childhood, and youth; 11, on the king and vassal; 111, on family structures, 'lignage'; iv, on the formation of cycles. The texts used for the study are all the published chansons de geste but H. sees the work of Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube as crucial to the development of the genre so this is given particular emphasis. Certain other texts, such as Jehan de Lanson and Hervis de Metz, are also given more detailed analysis. One of the most interesting aspects of the study is the examination of the role of the king(s) through the period. Overall H. sets out to show the continuity of the genre through its development.</page><page sequence="5">54 French Studies la chanson de roland. R.-J. Bery, 'Les deux scenes du cor dans la Chanson de Roland", RoN, 30, 1989-1990:115-24, is a sensible reappraisal of the critical interpretations of these scenes. B. concen trates on what Roland actually says, on what is written in the text, in accordance with what we know about epic narrative technique which is dramatic and externalizing rather than analytical and implicit. The Song of Roland, trans. Glyn Burgess, 1990, Harmondsworth, Penguin, 219 pp., has large sections of the Old French in an appendix, following the format of the Penguin translation of the Lais of Marie de France (1986), an alternative to the parallel text format. A glossary of unusual terms, e.g. feudal terms or items of armour, is appended. The wide-ranging introduction, clearly aimed at the general reader, inch many of the major issues surrounding the Roland: origins of epic, nature of the discourse and structure of the text, integrality of the Baligant episode etc. A. Clej, 'Le miroir du roi: une reflexion sur la Chanson de Roland', RPh, 44, 1990:36-53, analyses laisse 155 (Bedier edn) as a springboard for a new discussion of the origins of the poem, looking in particular at the relationship between Charlemagne and Roland. P. Haidu, 'Funerary rituals in the Chanson de Roland', Grigbsy Vol., 187-202, analyses in some detail the lament for the dead, the revenge upon the retreating saracens, the discovery, collection, evisceration and burial of the heroes' bodies, bringing out the implications of this analysis for the question of the integrality of the Baligant episode. H. then studies the Aude episode, giving it the importance and value it deserves, as this episode has often been rather summarily dismissed. Aude's reaction to Roland's death is seen in the light of the value systems of the Middle Ages. W. W. Kibler, 'The prologue to the Lyon MS of the Chanson de Rolana", ib., 217-28, studies the twelve lines (ten of them from the beginning of Chretien's Yvain) which precede the Roland in this MS, considered in conjunction with the other modifications of the text, and with similar apparently unrelated opening lines in other MSS of different texts. K. argues that these lines in ZT are integral to the writer's conception of the text. E. J. Michel, Ganelon, Treason and the cChanson de Roland', Penn State Press, 1989, 184 pp., is an important and detailed analysis of the trial and punishment of Ganelon. M. is not the first to set Ganelon's trial in the context of medieval law, but his examination of what can be established about medieval law and the implications of this for our interpretations of the Roland is the most thorough to date. Many medieval documents and legal treatises are used and a number of issues examined, incl. Charlemagne's role and Ganelon's defence. The important variants of the Chateauroux MS are taken into consideration. Finally the dating implications of his perceptions are discussed. J. Reed, 'The "bref' in the Chanson de Roland, FSB, 39:3-7,</page><page sequence="6">Early Medieval Literature 55 is a brief but important note on the problems of the href, when could it have been written? what were its contents? R. argues that Charlemagne wrote it and that Marsile honestly divulges its contents. The question of the order of the laisses and the reliability of the Oxford text is brought up. R.'s suggestion that Ganelon knew the contents and that their purpose was partly to protect Ganelon in demanding the algalife as hostage is one that could alter our perception of Charlemagne and of the value of Ganelon to the Franks. other epics. W. Calin, 'Women and their sexuality in Ami et Amile: an occasion to deconstruct', Olifant 16: 77-89, is a response to S. Kay's feminist analysis of the poem (FS, 44, 1990:129-42). C. insists his conclusions must be taken alongside K.'s. He argues that Amile and Belissant are not punished for defying patriarchal feudal order and sees this part of the poem as a wish-fulfilment fantasy. C. goes on to look again at Lubias, almost sympathetically, suggesting elements of reality and a level of communication in the marriage between Ami and Lubias. C. sees the conflict as less male/female and more clerical/lay. It is not easy to reconcile C.'s ideas with those of K., but perhaps, as C. himself states, we need to hold both interpretations in mind. S. Gregory, Tour un commentaire d'un passage obscur du Charroi de Nimes\ Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 381-83, concerning 11. 908-17 (McMillan edn) is a note on the puns and humour of the passage. W. L. Hendrickson, 'Garin de Monglane and La Chanson de la croisade albigeoise: a comparative Old French-Occitan study', Grigsby Vol., 203-17, suggests parallels between Garin de Monglane and Simon de Montfort. A. Labbe, 'Corps et cceur dans Girart de Roussillon\ Le cCuer\ 161-86, through a detailed lexical analysis shows a unity underlying the diversity of this poem. K. V. Sinclair, 'Un fragment inedit de la chanson de geste d'Auberi le Bourguignon', AJFS, 26, 1989:115-24, edits a short fragment of some 120 lines with a brief introduction. I. Weill, 'Les syntagmes du cceur dans la geste des Lorrains', Le (Cuer\ 461-70, examines the function of'cuer' in Garin le Loherin, Gerbert de Mez, and Anseys de Mes, its meaning, position in the line, position at the rhyme, its grammatical function. 3. Romance general and general Arthurian. R. H. Bloch, 'The Arthurian fabliau and the poetics of virginity', Grigsby Vol., 231-50, examines the feminine chastity testing motif in the First Continuation of Perceval, the Livre de Caradoc, the Vengeance Raguidel, the Prose Tristan, and the ordeal of the mantel and horn in 'Du mantel mautaillie', and the 'Lai du cor'. Attitudes to women are studied in the context of Christian writings and the Bible. M. Combarieau du Gres,' "Un cceur gros comme ca":</page><page sequence="7">56 French Studies (le cceur dans le Lancelot-Graal)', Le eCuer\ 77-105, examines the divers meanings of 'cuer' in the Grail cycle, first as a vital organ, damage to which can cause death or loss of consciousness. This may be caused by strong emotion as well as injury, thus linking the heart as seat of the emotions to the heart as organ. C. goes on to analyse the complex relationship between 'heart' and 'body'. The heart is also seen as the seat of moral life. C. shows the diversity and degree of unity between the texts. J. M. Dornbush, Pygmalion's Figure: Reading Old French Romance, Lexington, KY, French Forum, 1990, 153 pp., is an excellent study exploring issues of interpretation of Old French Romance in the 12th and 13th cs, largely through studies of Thomas's Tristan, Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose, and the Prose Lancelot, concentrating on passages on image-making. D. calls us back to medieval literary concepts with an emphasis on rhetoric and the rhetorical training of the Middle Ages. Quotations from Latin and Old French are translated. J. J. Duggan, 'Oral performance of romance in Medieval France', Grigsby Vol., 51-61, after reminding us of the textual evidence for romances being read aloud, sets out other evidence of courtly material being part of jongleurs' performances. R. A. Dwyer, 'Scriveners' tales: scribal versions of the French prose romances', Lagorio and Day, Arthur, 1, 99-109, surveys Palamedes, the Compilation of Rusticiano da Pisa, the Prophecies de Merlin, the Compilation of Michel Gonnot, Le Chevalier du Papegau. E. Kennedy, 'Failure in Arthurian romance', MAe, 60:16-32, examines how failure is presented, as the inability of a character or with emphasis on the striving. K. shows how the failure of one knight may enhance the success of another. The place of failure in the romance pattern is demonstrated. The Grail poems are studied in detail, beginning with Chretien, particularly in terms of the readers' expectations and whether they are fulfilled. C. Moorman, 'Literature of defeat and conquest: the Arthurian revival of the twelfth century', Lagorio and Day, Arthur, 1, 22-43, as^s wnv there is an outburst of Arthurian literature in the period 1050-1180, looking at certain Celtic texts, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and Chretien. M. suggests that all of these are different reactions to the Norman invasion of England. L. Morin, 'La naissance du roman medieval', DFS, 16, 1989:3-14, sets the begin nings of romance in the context of the 12th c. which M. sees as a period full of change and of new things, while the society of the time sought continuity and permanence. The romance is presented as lit. impinging on reality attempting to reconcile the new with the old. M. Plouzeau, 'Si n'aies pas le cuer parfont! lexique et syntaxe', Le cCuer\ 273-96, examines parfont/par font in Raguidel P.2522 in the context of similar expressions in a number of other texts from the end of the 12th to the end of the 13th c. E. H. Ruck, An Index of Themes and Motifs in</page><page sequence="8">Early Medieval Literature 57 i2th-Century French Arthurian Poetry, Woodbridge, Boydell and Brewer, 192 pp., covers Arthurian material up to and including the beginning of the 13th c. R. limits herself to Arthurian material, and therefore in Wace to the Arthurian sections and in Marie de France to the Arthurian Lais (although reference to non-Arthurian lais and parts of Wace can be found in the notes). The Index is easy to use and most comprehensive, covering not only recognized literary motifs and topoi such as the Faithless Wife or the Rash Boon, but a wider range of motifs from heraldry to the spoils of tournaments, from Fate to religious motifs, and from the hero's accomplishments to the use of tu. D. Regnier-Bohler (ed.), *La Legende arthurienne: le Graal et la Table Ronde, Laffont, 1989, lix + 1206 pp., contains in modern French trans. Chretien's Perceval, Perlesvaus, Robert de Boron, Merlin, Hunbaut, Glilois, Blandin de Cornouille, Les Merveilles de Rigomer, Le Chevalier de Papegau, and others. P. Zumthor, 'De Perceval a Don Quichotte', Poetique, 89:259-69, examines the concept of the knight errant in the Middle Ages and how that eventually led to Don Quixote. Z. starts with the examples of Calogrenant and Perceval which he links to the problem of space in the 12th c. Wm. Calin, 'Amadas et Ydoine: the problematic world of an idyllic romance', Grigsby Vol., 39-50, studies the use of a number of love conventions, pushed to their limits within the text. C. looks at the interplay of illusion and reality in the text. The author's use of the material of Tristan and Cliges is seen through this analysis. H.-E. Keller, 'De l'amour dans le Roman de Brut\ ib., 63-82, studies the presentation of sexuality, eroticism, and love in Wace's Brut, showing that W. gives different picture of'real' love and relegates 'fin' amor' to the fictitious world of Arthur. D. Kelly, 'Description and narrative in romance: the contextual co-ordinates of Meraugis de Portllesguez and the Bel Inconnu\ ib., 83-94, examines the place of description in medieval narrative through a study of these two texts. S. Aronstein, 'Prize or pawn: homosocial order, marriage and the redefinition of women in the Gawain Continuation1, RR, 82:115-26, studies the text within the context of anthropological and feminist criticism. The question of how and why the romance woman is redefined in the Continuation is asked and convincingly answered. G. Torrini-Roblin, 'Oral or written model? Description, length and unity in the First Continuation, Grigsby Vol., 145-62, examines the different redactions of the First Continuation. F. Dubost, 'Procedures d'initialite dans la litterature du Graal', Actes (Montpellier), 16-33, first classifies the exordia; considerable attention is paid to the Estoire del Saint Graal; D. suggests that all forms reveal the ambiguous nature of the relationship between the writer and text: 'ecrivain ou ecrivanf; the continuations are a special case given separate treatment; a study of one particular topos of the opening phase then follows: the arrival of a</page><page sequence="9">58 French Studies character. A. L. Furtado, 'Geoffrey of Monmouth: a source of the Grail stories', Quondam et Futurus, 1:1-14, looks at the relationship between Chretien, Peredur in the Mabinogion, and Geoffrey of Mon mouth. This link is seen as a key to understanding some of the problems in Chretien's text, such as the role of Gawain or the advice of Gornemant. N. J. Lacy, 'The design of the Didot-PercevaP, Grigsby Vol., 95-106, is a re-appraisal of the structure of this text. While acknowledging its limitations, L. makes out a good case for the revaluation of the Didot-Perceval. The preface to La Mort le Roi Arthur, trans. Monique Santucci, Champion, 255 pp., a trans, of Frappier's edn, places the Mort in its literary context and the narrative is analysed in some detail. A. Henry, 'Enchises, un mot-fantome', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 379?81, examines the meaning of enchises in the Prose Lancelot. R. Hyatte, 'Recoding ideal male friendship as fine amor in the prose Lancelot', Neophilologus, 75:505-18, studies the relationship between Galehout and Lancelot. H. takes as a model Ciceronian perfect friendship, the fine amor of Tristan and Iseut in Thomas, and that of Lancelot and Guinevere in the prose Lancelot.]. F. Plummer, 'The quest for significance in La Queste del Saint Graal and Malory's Tale of the SankgreaV, Grigsby Vol., 107-19, examines how Malory has adapted the Queste in semiotic terms. P. suggests that understanding (through the sign, the glass, the commentary) is more important in the Queste than in Malory. M. Szkilnik, L'Archipel du Graal: etude de VEstoire del Saint Graal, Geneva, Droz, presents a very positive view of the text, suggesting that through the images of the sea-voyage the text is tightly knit. The images and stages of the sea-journey in the text are shown to be also images of the composition of the text. Analysis of themes, images and concepts is firmly within the context of the use of similar themes in other medieval texts. C.-A. van Coolput, 'La Poupee d'Evalac ou la conversion tardive du roi Mordrain', Grigsby Vol., 163-72, examines the Estoire, particularly in the light of the Quete. Chretien de troyes. B. Aguirano, 'Le cceur dans Chretien', Le eCuer\ 10-25, looks first at 'cceur' and 'corage' in the secondary characters, acknowledging the difficulty in defining these, then analyses the 'cceur' of the hero and his lady. J. T. Grimbert, 'Misrepresentation and misconception in Chretien de Troyes; non verbal and verbal semiotics in Erec en Enide and Perceval'Wasserman, Sign, 50-79, extends G.'s semiotic study of Yvain to Erec et Enide and Perceval, showing the treatment of the problem of the discrepancy between reality and the signs used to represent it. G. looks first at non-verbal signs in Perceval then turns to verbal signs, which can clear up ambiguous non-verbal signs but can also be themselves misunder stood or misleading. The use of language and silence in the two texts is</page><page sequence="10">Early Medieval Literature 59 also crucial and is studied in some detail. S. Kay, 'Commemoration, memory and the role of the past in Chretien de Troyes: retrospection and meaning in Erec et Enide, Yvain and Perceval', RMS, 17:31-50, defines commemoration as the retelling of events by the characters within the text. Past time is a theme, one aspect of whose treatment is commemorative discourse in which the hero's exploits are reviewed. The romances are then studied in turn. The conclusion shows how commemoration, memory, and forgetfulness and the role of the past change through these three texts. Past time remains important but K. sees increasing pessimism about our ease of access, the erasability of past error and the value of retrospection as a key to understanding. H. R. Runte, 'Initial readers of Chretien de Troves', Grigsby Vol., 121-32, examines indices in the MSS of how Chretien's texts were read. These indices may be subdivisions of the text by initials or the use of miniatures, providing 'visual structuring' of the text. N. Bradley Croney, 'The "recreantise" episode in Chretien's Erec et Enide', Chickering, Chivalry, 449-71, sets out first the understanding of chivalry in the Chanson de Roland, then the shifts in emphasis by c. 1170. From this context B. turns to a definition of recreantise. J. A. Nightingale, 'Chretien de Troyes and the mythographical tradition: the couple's journey in Erec et Enide and Martianus' De Nuptis', Lagorio and Day, Arthur, 1, 56?79, is an intertextual analysis of Chretien and his intentions in Erec et Enide with particular reference to the meaning oiconjointure and coniunctura as used by Alain de Lille, who makes considerable use of Martianus in De Plancta Naturae. G. Paoli, 'La relation ceil?cceur: recherches sur la mystique amoureuse de Chretien de Troyes dans Cliges', Le 'Cuer\ 233-44, examines the ceil-cceur relationship in the light of concepts found in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, and in Islam, which are presented as possible influences on Chretien, although P. acknowledges that the apparent knowledge of Islam seen in Cliges may be no more than a coincidence of images. Z. P. Zaddy, 'Les castors ichthyophages de Chretien de Troves', MA, 97:41-46, looks at the meaning of bievre in Cliges, 3850, with possible interpretations supported by medieval and i6th-c. texts. H. Arden, 'Chretien de Troyes's Lancelot and the structure of twelfth-century French romance', Lagorio and Day, Arthur, 1, 80-98. opens with a review of some of the structural analyses of Chretien, then concentrates on the problems of structure in the Lancelot. Chretien's other romances are also used as 'clues' to try to unravel this most complex romance. L. D. Wolfgang, 'Chretien's Lancelot: love and philology', RMS, 17:3-18, is to a degree a defence of Lancelot but also raises important methodological questions. The MS problems are set out and six passages then examined in some detail. B. N. Sargent-Baur, '"Avis li fu": vision and cognition in the</page><page sequence="11">6o French Studies Conte du GraaV, Grigsby Vol., 133-44, examines the techniques of characterization in Chretien's Conte du Graal. Y. G. Lepage, 'Encore les trois cents pucelles (Chretien de Troyes, Yvain v. 5298-5324)', CCM, 133:159-66, is a reassessment (with an examination of previous scholarship) revolving round the meaning of gaegnier. R. Rosenstein, '"Celi que del cuer voit": le don du cceur, d'Yvain a la chanson de Croisade', Le cCuer\ 363-74, shows the motif to be something of a topos before Chretien's use of it in Yvain. R. widens the whole idea of the source for Chretien. R. examines in detail its meaning in the Chanson de Croisade. tristan. C. Chocheyras, 'Sur les sources livresques possibles de quelques motifs tristaniens', Pris MA, 7:27-42, looks at sources for (i) the name and character of Andret, (ii) St Andrew and his legend, (hi) Tristan and Theseus, from which C. draws general conclusions on the development of the legend. R. Colliot, 'Messages d'amour et de mort dans la legende de Tristan: anneaux et lais', ib., 43-56 looks at the object, in this case in particular the ring as signifier, as message, particularly in the verse texts, then at the use in the Prose Tristan of poems as a means of communication. The two symbols, carriers of death, are brought together at the end of the Prose Tristan. R. Hyatt, 'Arthur as Marc's and Tristan's double in the French Tristan fragments by Beroul and Thomas', Lagorio and Day, Arthur, 1, 110-26, looks at the 'Arthurianization' of the Tristan legend. H. suggests that in Beroul Arthur is Mark's counterpart and in Thomas he is Tristan's. The parallels are analysed in some detail. H. sees B.'s Mark as very unsympathetic. Arthur is his antithesis. K. Busby, 'Le Tristan de Beroul en tant qu'intertexte', Grigsby Vol., 19-38, relates the adulterous love to the lyric, looking at e.g. B.'s vocabulary. The three barons and other aspects are shown to have echoes of epic, but elements of parody of epic are also discerned and the use of epic techniques discussed. Fabliau elements in B. are then examined. Busby finally looks at the all-important romance nature of the poem. The study raises the whole question of genre and intertextuality with regard to medieval texts. A. Saly, 'Images recurrentes dans le Tristan de Beroul', Pris MA, 7:107-18, deals with the coherence of the text and in this context studies the motifs and images within a number of episodes. The study does not claim to be comprehensive but rather to call attention to Beroul's method of composition. M. R. Blakeslee, 'Misogynie, "fin' amur" et ambigufte dans le Tristan de Thomas', ib., 1-16, questions the traditional, sometimes simplistic, view of Thomas as courtly and seeks to show an essential ambivalence in the text in the attitude to love. F. Lecoy, 'Sur l'etendue probable du Tristan de Thomas', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 378?79, is a recalculation of the possible length of Thomas's Tristan on the basis of the lacuna in the</page><page sequence="12">Early Medieval Literature 61 Sneyd fragment; L. concludes that it was c. 12,082 lines. P. M. Thomas, 'Nuances of chastity: the Tristan of Thomas', FSB, 41:1-3, looks at the question of mental and physical chastity with regard to the four main characters, Ysolt of the White Hands, Tristan, Ysolt the Fair and, Mark, vis-a-vis each other. M.-L. Chenerie, 'Le senechal Keu dans le Tristan en prose'', Pris MA, 7:17-26, analyses the role and character of Kay in the prose Tristan, showing what this character owes to the prose Lancelot and how different he is from the depiction of Kay in other Tristan texts. Finally C. shows his importance thematically particularly through his relationship with Kahedrin. F. Dubost, 'Trois geants, trois epoques, un "roman": le geant poseur d'enigmes, le geant de Cornouailles at Taulas de la Montagne dans le Tristan en prose', ib., 57-72, suggests that the 'giant' of the Prose Tristan is so only in name. This thesis is supported by a study of each of the giants in turn. D. concludes that the presentation of the giants represents three periods, three types of writing. The study is firmly set in the context of the treatment of the merveilleux in general and in the historical and, crucially, religious context. P. Walter, 'Un archetype mythologique du Tristan en prose: le geant', ib., 119-31 works from the basis of the intertextuality of this work. The figure of the giant is chosen as an important one in Tristan lit. and in human mythology. The prehistory of Arthurian tradition is also examined and the giant seen as the possible intermediary in the 'Arthurianization' of the Tristan legend. lais. Marie de France, Les Fables, ed. Charles Bruchner, Lou vain, Peeters, 402 pp., is an edn with parallel modern French trans. The introduction gives the Fables the treatment normally given to the Lais, looking at sources, literary merit, MS tradition, etc. A useful glossary and index complete the edn. M. T. Bruckner, 'Of men and beasts in Bisclavref, RR, 82:251-69, examines Marie's lai in terms of the duality of human nature (man/beast) beginning from the problematic opening and closing lines. The other major dualities discussed are the marvellous/nature and male/female. Parallels with Adam and Eve, briefly noted, are interesting. The importance of the interrelationships of characters in the humanity of an individual is stressed. Bisclavret may unite the man and beast but in the conclusion the male/female couple is split. M. T. Bruckner, 'Strategies of naming in Marie de France's Lais: at the crossroads of gender and genre', Neophilologus, 75:31-40, examines patterns of naming and not naming of characters, the names of the lais and her naming of herself. J.-C. Bibolet, '"Guillaume, as-tu du cuer?" ou "cuer" dans Le vair palefroi', Le (Cuer\ 43-53, treats the text as a lai and 'histoire d'amour', rather than a fabliau. B. examines in detail the occurrences of 'cuer' and 'corage' in the text. Lenora D. Wolfgang,</page><page sequence="13">62 French Studies Le Lai de VOiselet: An Old French Poem of the Thirteenth Century, (transactions of the American Philosophical Society, 80, part 5, 1990), Philadelphia, American Pilosophy Society, uses MS B as a base MS with a list of rejected readings. The texts of the other MSS are given in full in diplomatic and synoptic texts. W. gives a very detailed textual study and examines e.g. sources and analogues, making interesting generic and stylistic observations. other courtly literature. The Romances of Alexander, ed. D. M. Kratz, NY, Garland, 1990, 175 pp., translates the Latin texts Iter ad Paradisum and Epistula Alexandri ad Aristotelem which are so important to an understanding of the development of the Alexander legend in western Europe in the Middle Ages. L. C. Brook, 'The continuators monologue: Godefroy de Lagny and Jean de Meun', FS, 45:1-16, compares Godefroy's use of monologue to Chretien's. Jean de Meun's approach as a continuator is different to that of G., and B. shows that while he links his monologue to the text of his predecessor he actually subverts it. H. Kluppelholz, 'The continuation within the model: Godefroi de Lagny's "solution" to Chretien de Troyes' Chevalier de la Charrette", Neophilologus, 75:342?44, while unfortunately incomplete due to a printing error, looks at the way Godefroy alters what appears to have been Chretien's intention while profiting from Chretien's reputation. Guillaume le Clerc, Fergus of Galloway: Knight of King Arthur, trans. D. D. R. Owen, London, Wiedenfeld and Nicolson (Every man), is a trans, with introduction and notes of this little known Arthurian text of the late 12 th and early 13th c. The introduction is helpful, placing Guillaume in the context of the lit. of the period and outlining his use of Chretien. An appendix offers a possible identifica tion of the author and suggests the literary value of the text has been underrated. L. de Looze, 'The gender of fiction: womanly poetics in Jean Renart's Guillaume de Dole', FR, 64:596-606, links the real/ fictional dichotomy of the work with gender, showing that in Guillaume de Dole, exceptionally, it is the men who seek or inhabit the fictional world and women the real world. The men reduce the women to the narrative level. Narrative and reality are expressed in the verbs oir, dire, and veoir. The difference between the sign and what it signifies is brought out and Lienor's disguise seen as a synthesis of masculine and feminine. H. Braet, 'Le Roman de la Rose: espace du regard', SFr, 103:1?12, studies the iconography of the Roman de la Rose, its representation in MSS. F. Vieillard, 'Sain Cicaut', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 383-92, finds other references to this saint, men tioned in the Roman des Sept Sages de Rome, and suggests his possible identity as Sigibaldus, Bishop of Metz. P. Gallais and J. Thomas, 'L'arbre et la foret dans YEneide et YEneas: de la psyche antique a la psyche medievale. 111. Condensation et mutation des symboles: YEneas</page><page sequence="14">Early Medieval Literature 63 ou l'unite edifice', Pris MA; 6, 1990:209-36, is a comparative analysis of the I2th-c. text and its source, going beyond looking at the symbolism of trees and attitude to nature. From a description of the tomb of Camille G. and T. go on to give a brief survey of impossible structures in medieval French lit. using a wide range of texts. A. Paupert, 'L'arbre, l'amour et la mort: a propos de Floire etBlancheflor et Piramus et Thisbe\ ib., 75-88, concentrates on four passages in F. et B., looking in the symbolism of the tree for the 'senefiance' of the narrative. P. Eley, 'The myth of Trojan descent and perceptions of national identity: the case of Eneas and the Roman de Troie\ NMS, 35:27-40, examines such factors as are linked to national groupings: language, territory, kinship, social and political institutions, and culture, with the aim of determining whether the two texts show a common sense of 'Trojanness'. The sources of the texts (Dares Phrygius and Virgil) are taken into account. The degree of consensus between the texts is shown to be remarkable, although there are differences. H. B. Teunis, *'Benoit of St Maure and William the Conqueror's "amor"', Proceedings of the Battle Conference, 1989, ed. M. Chibnall, Woodbridge, Boydell and Brewer, 1990, 199-209. F. Vieilliard, 'Le Roman de Troie en prose dans la version du MS Rouen, Bibl. mun. 0.33, "Membra Disjecta", d'un MS plus ancien?', Romania, 109, 1988 [19911^502-39, describes the MS in detail and summarizes its content extensively. 4. Religious Literature B. B. Burnam, 'An unedited Anglo-Norman prologue to the Passion des Jongleurs and its relation to the Passio Christi of Clermont Ferrand', MAe, 60:197?206, is an edn with introduction and linguistic analysis of this short prologue, dated around the first half of the 13th c. Parallel lines from the ioth-c. Passio Christi, close links with which are shown, are printed alongside. B. Cazelles, The Lady as Saint: A Collection of French Hagiographic Romances of the Thirteenth Century, Pennsylvania U.P., 334 pp. is a fascinating anthology of translations of thirteen hagiographies, although unfortunately the original Old French is not given and many of the edns of these texts are old and not widely available. The study which forms the first part of the vol. examines ideals of femininity and sanctity in the texts. G. Gros, 'La semblance de la verrine, description et interpretation d'une image mariale', MA, 97:217-57, examines this symbol in secular (e.g. Chretien de Troyes and Wace) and religious texts in Old French and Latin, throughout the medieval period. H. E. Keller and W. Meiden, 'Le Roman de Saint Paul', ib., 189-216 is an edition with a short introduction of this i3th-c. verse account of the dream of St Paul. A. Lupin, '"Arte callidissima et occulta": La Sequence de Sainte Eulalie en ancien</page><page sequence="15">64 French Studies francais', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991] 1447-71, gives first the linguistic context of this text followed by a reinterpretation of its literary aspect. The sources of the Sequence are brought into consideration. L. presents a very positive reassessment of the text. G. Milin, 'La Vita Ronani et les contes de loup-garou aux XIIe et XIIP siecles', MA, 97:259-73, beginning with a study of the 'loup-garou' episode in the Latin Life goes on to consider other treatments of the theme. M. A. Polo de Beaudieu, 'La legende du cceur inscrit dans la litterature religieuse et didactique', Le (Cuer\ 297-312, examines the topos of the heart inscribed with the name of Christ, concentrating on St Ignatius, the first to whom the miracle is ascribed. P. looks at the development of the topos, variants and other saints. J. R. Smeets (ed.), La Chevalerie de Judas Macchabee de Gautier de Belleperche (et de Pieros du Ries), Assen, van Gorcum, 2 vols, 413 + 557 pp. Vol. 1 is the introduction and critical apparatus, including the variants. The authors are discussed as well as date, sources, MSS, etc. The text (vol.11) of this i3th-c. poem is based on MS B with a minimum of corrections. J. Wogan-Browne, 'Saints' lives and the female reader', FMLS, 27:314-32, looks at 12th and I3th-c. vernacular (Anglo-Norman and Middle English) texts asking about the use of these texts. W. examines a historic case, 12th-c. Christina, of whom we have a Latin 'Life' written within a few years of her death. W. suggests that violence as a response to a girl's choice of virginity was at least credible. The place of hagiographic convention is acknowledged. The text is linked to the social context. W. looks also at the use of hagiography in the composition oiCliges. 5. Other Genres lyric. M. Abramowicz, 'Le lieu commun et l'imaginaire: exordes des pastourelles et des chansons de toile', Romania, 109, 1988 [1991]: 472-501, despite the difficulties in treating these genres together, does so successfully. The formulae of the exordia are classified into two groups. The structures in the pastourelles are examined first, then the chansons de toile. The exordium is the feature which both subgenres contain. Conclusions are drawn on both groups together. Deborah Hubbard Nelson (ed.), The Songs Attributed to Andrieu Contredit D3Arras, with a Translation into English and the Extant Melodies, Amsterdam, Rodopi, 207 pp.; the lyrics are trans, and ed. by D. H. N. and the melodies are edited by Hendrick van der Werf. This is an exceptionally comprehensive edn and trans, with the music. Each lyric is preceded by a brief introduction giving details of the MSS, edns, structure, and MS variations. A literary introduction by D. H. N. covers the literary milieu of Arras, the poet, the MS tradition, language and the form of the songs. The unusual feature of</page><page sequence="16">Early Medieval Literature 65 a musical introduction by H. van der W. gives a valuable insight into the musical background, tradition, rhythm, rhyme, and metre and MSS with a detailed discussion of three songs. drama. A. E. Knight, 'France', Simon, Theatre, 151-68, begins with a brief glance at the paucity of much earlier criticism then gives a detailed examination of more recent work. K. divides the drama into two periods: nth - end 13th c, 13th - mid-16th c, but first reviews some of the recent studies covering medieval theatre generally. An optimistic view of where things are going in drama studies is given. D. Maddox, 'Rewriting recognition in early medieval veridictory drama', Grigsby Vol., 277-98, studies a range of medieval texts in the light of the Aristotelian concept of recognition. M. first justifies the use of a concept which was not itself well known in the Middle Ages, then examines the texts, beginning with Latin liturgical plays and including Jean Bodel's Jeu de saint Nicolas and the Jeu de la Feuillee, both of which are examined at length. history and chronicle. J. R. E. Bliese, 'The courage of the Normans: a comparative study of battle rhetoric', NMS, 35:1-26, gives an analysis of battle speeches in the chronicles in terms of what they tell us about the self-image of the Normans. The chronicles dating c. 1000 ? c. 1250 are mostly in Latin but B. includes Wace who is discussed in some detail. S. Lloyd, 'William Longuespee II: the making of an English crusading hero', NMS, 35:41-69, is the first part of a longer study. L. examines how a historical defeat is turned into a moral victory (something which is almost a topos of medieval literature). L. is concerned more with the creation of a myth about Longuespee than establishing historical accuracy and to this end examines the chronicles, e.g. Matthew Paris and Joinville. roman de renard. F. de la Breteque, 'La place de Noble dans l'imaginaire du Roman de Renarf, Pris MA, 7:171-82, studies the different manifestations of Noble. The branches are looked at in three groups: 1, 'Le roi lointain', branches 11 and va; 11, 'Le plaid et le siege', branches 1, ia, ib; in, 'Le lion declinant', branches x and xi. Concluding that the character of Noble is not a coherent, unified one, B. still shows that either simultaneously or sequentially Noble can fulfil various functions. One is left with an appreciation of the richness of the texts. M. de Combarieu, '"Faire la morte vielle": la ruse de la mort feinte dans le Roman de Renarf, ib., 153-70, first surveys this ruse in the different branches , classified by purpose: why is the animal pretending to be dead? C. shows the motif to have its roots in the observation of the Bestiaries and brings out the dramatic and often comic elements of the motif. P. Gallais, 'Et si Chretien etait l'auteur de Lietart? L'argument de la versification', ib., 7:229-55, readdresses the question of the authorship of tranche ix, first questioning the major 3</page><page sequence="17">66 French Studies assumption which has generally led to Chretien being dismissed as the author, i.e. the date, largely based on the identification of the 'conte Thibaut'. G. goes on to analyse in detail the quality and nature of the versification, throughout this analysis making comparisons with Chretien's known works and, by way of control, with other courtly texts. He concludes that either Chretien had at least a hand in the composition of this text or one of his friends or disciples was responsible for it. K. Gravdal, 'Law and literature in the French middle ages: rape law on trial in Le Roman de Renart", RR, 82:1-24, examines the complex interweaving of literary and legal models in the Roman de Renart, classified under four interrelations: subversion, literary mimesis ? a critique of actual practices, faithful repro duction, undermining of literary or cultural discourse of courtly love. A detailed analysis of the relevant branches is set in the context of medieval law and the legal question of rape is presented as a vehicle for wider issues. G. Gros, 'Au plaisir des noms: le Roman de Renart branche x (ed. M. Roques): essai d'onomastique litteraire', Pris MA, 7:205-28, examines in turn the names in this branche giving most space to Lietart and Bruntamin, working from the premise that names in lit. are not chance but may tell us much about the intentions of the writer. The name itself is shown as a possible vehicle of satire. Anthony Lodge and Kenneth Varty, The Earliest Branches of the 'Roman de RenartNew Alyth, Lochee Publications, 1989, is an edition of branches 11 and va. The literary context and critical background of these Branches are clearly explained. The writers disagree with the commonly held belief that the texts were written by one man. A detailed analysis of the text is given. M. Pastoureau, 'Entre chien et loup: introduction a l'etude du goupil', Pris MA, 7:133-46, the first study in a fascicule given over to the study of 'les Romans de Renart', serves as an introduction to the others, looking first at where the fox fits into the animal kingdom. The naturalists' view is presented within a historical perspective. The etymological links between, Goupil, vulpes and lupus are set out and attitudes and treatment of the fox examined. J. Subrenat, 'Renart en son chateau', ib., 7:183-94, notes first that only Renart comes from a specific named place, the chateau de Maupertuis. S. looks at the residence of the other animals, Noble's palace, but the lovere of Ysengrin. The king lives in a totally 'human' environment, the wolf in a largely animal one. S. then studies the various descriptions of the chateau de Maupertuis as a well fortified castle with all the trappings of a feudal seat, and as a fosse or tesnere, both descriptions coming from the oldest branche through the tradition. Renart, when vulnerable, is seen in his fosse, Renart invincible in his chateau. The man/beast dichotomy is seen united in the fox. S. draws from this study conclusions which are helpful for an</page><page sequence="18">Early Medieval Literature 67 understanding of the complexity of the way the anthromorphization occurs in the texts as a whole. fabliaux. L. S. Crist, 'Gastrographie et pornographie dans les fabliaux', Grigsby Vol., 251-60, examines the link between eating and sex in the fabliau. E. Suomela-Harma, 'Le cceur, le corps et le cul: variationa lexicales dans les fabliaux', Le (Cuer\ 393-408, is a detailed lexical analysis based on an examination of the use of 'cuer' and variants in all the published fabliaux. L. D. Wolfgang, 'Les Trois Savoirs in Phillipps Manuscript 25970', Grigsby Vol., 311-22, gives the lines of this fabliau not transcribed by P. Meyer (Romania, 37) from a MS hitherto believed to have been lost. W.'s main concern is with the parallels with the Lai de Voiselet. A brief introduction gives examples of Anglo-Norman features in the text.</page></plain_text>
