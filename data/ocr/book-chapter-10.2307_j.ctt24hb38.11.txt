(song composed by the SPR Band on 5/10/96 at Albalak village to  celebrate the recovery of a dentate-stamped sherd from Malua Bay) Introduction As outlined earlier a total of fifteen cave sites (eleven of which are discussed here) and four open sites were excavated on the northwest coast of Malekula (Fig. 3.16) in line with a research strategy designed to answer a number of specific questions. All site stratigraphy and associated dates are outlined in detail in Chapter 3. terra australis 23 133 </page> <page sequence="2"> Pieces of the Vanuatu Puzzle Although results gleaned from the excavations and the later analyses went some way in addressing the archaeological terra incognita that was Malekula, substantial gaps in the archaeological sequence do remain and in many respects this research can be regarded as only very preliminary. Now more fully understood are the two ends of the cultural sequence on Malekula. One is specifically related to the timing and associated cultural remains of the initial settlement of Malekula and the other with the last 500 years prior to European contact. It was not possible to define the central portion of the ceramic sequence due to two inter-related factors: the sparse remains that were recovered from most of the caves and the likelihood that this area of Malekula experienced a period of abandonment or less intensive settlement after initial colonisation. Many of the excavated cave sites returned only a handful of plain sherds from which only limited information could be extracted (see Table 7.1). Despite this fact certain patterns could be identified, particularly when related to the more abundant materials excavated from the open sites of Malua Bay, Chachara, Nuas and the cave site of Navaprah. The central focus of this current research on Malekula then is the characterisation of the early and late ceramic remains for which a robust sample was recovered within stratified contexts. The methodology used for the characterisation of the ceramic remains has been outlined in Chapter 4. Of the total number of excavated sherds (1710) 90% were plain body sherds which somewhat limited the analysis, although several vessels could be identified through their distinctive form or fabric. Very distinctive body sherds included calcareous-tempered sherds which could be attributed to one of the three known early vessel forms (2i, 2iii and 4ii) (Figs 7.1a, 7.2, 7.3), ribbed sherds (where the coils of clay used in the manufacture of terra australis 23 134 Table 7.1 Malekula ceramic sample (excavated sites only).

Ninety percent of the recovered sherds came from the four sites of Malua Bay, Chachara, Nuas and Navaprah. Surface collected sherds and those held in museum collections hinted at a much richer and diverse range of vessel form and decoration but very few of these were recovered from excavated contexts. Although a substantial section of the ceramic sequence remains elusive the above-mentioned sherds are illustrated to provide a tantalising glimpse of the diversity in form and decoration which as yet cannot be placed within a chronological context (Figs 7.6–7.13). The presentation of this surface collected material is not included within the analytical structure that was utilised for the excavated materials but an attempt was made to establish any variation in vessel form or decoration. None of the surface collected sherds were calcareously-tempered. Also briefly discussed are those ceramic vessels known as Naamboi, thought to be largely restricted to the south of Malekula, that have been used in various ceremonial capacities from at least the early ethnographic period up until today. The geographical distribution of vessel forms and motifs from both the excavated and surface collected sherds is included later in this chapter along with a discussion of associated implications. Fabric Not surprisingly over a 3000 year period some variation in fabric composition is to be expected especially on an island the size of Malekula. Definition of fabrics was established through a combined macroscopic and petrographic analysis of the sherds. Petrographic analysis was undertaken by William Dickinson. Dickinson had previously studied 20 sherds from various locations around Malekula that had been collected by Richard and Elizabeth Shutler. The sherds selected by the Shutlers were identified as being indigenous to Malekula but the mineral inclusions demonstrated great variability which precluded the identification of specific areas of ceramic manufacture. A further 12 sherds were selected from the recently excavated and surface collected materials and sent to Dickinson (see Appendix 3 for full reports WRD-155 and 180). These sherds included two from the earliest excavated deposits on the northwest coast along with a further ten being selected on the basis of them being related to a particular pot form or decoration. Dickinson’s reaction (pers. comm.) in describing them as a ‘morass’ (petrographically speaking), further confirmed both the widespread nature of ceramic manufacture on Malekula and that similar pot forms and associated decoration were being made throughout the island, rather than being restricted to a limited number of manufacturing centres. All the sherds, bar one (see below), were indigenous to Malekula. The most distinctive difference that could be pinpointed was that the early sherds were calcareously-tempered and the later sherds were not. For the purposes of the analyses below the fabrics are divided into these two broad categories. Fabric 1) Two sherds were selected from the earliest levels of the Malua Bay and Navaprah sites. Both contained calcareous temper along with volcanic sand rich in felsitic volcanic rock fragments characteristic of other Malekula mineral inclusions which are moderately to well sorted, fine-to-medium-grained sands composed largely of subrounded grains, probably of beach derivation. This fabric characterises the thus far earliest excavated ceramics from Malekula and is associated only with the first few hundred years of settlement. Fabric 2) This all-encompassing fabric is characterised by having an eclectic group of non- calcareous mineral inclusions that can be said to be indigenous to Malekula. The volcanic rock fragments are again dominated by felsitic grains which are typically moderately sorted, subangular to subrounded volcanic sands, which probably represent stream alluvium derived from the island’s interior. Attempting to pinpoint specific areas of manufacture was seen as an unnecessary (particularly as the petrographic results pointed towards the pottery being village specific) and potentially inconclusive exercise (Dickinson pers. comm.), beyond the scope of this research. terra australis 23 136 </page> <page sequence="5">  Malekula ceramics Figure 7.4    Malekula vessel form and decoration.

Malua Bay School Mk-3-55 A total of 719 sherds were recovered from the 11 test pits excavated at the Malua Bay School site, 669 (93%) of which were plain sherds, 45 (6%) were rims, 4 decorated body sherds and one was a carinated sherd (Tables 7.2 and 7.3; Fig. 7.1c). Several ribbed sherds (i.e. unmodified surface of coil constructed vessels) were also noted. The Malua Bay School ceramic assemblage related to two distinct occupations. Those recovered from the lower layers were associated with a short-term colonising Lapita settlement. The sherds were excavated from within a matrix of concentrated cultural debris which had been buried beneath a tephra (see Chapter 3). Sherds recovered from the upper layers were more dispersed and had been subjected to vigorous post-depositional processes. The 669 plain sherds can be divided into two fabric types (Table 7.4). Sherds from the lower layers comprise exclusively of Fabric 1 while those from the upper layers are predominately Fabric 2. It seems likely that any Fabric 1 sherds recovered from the upper layers (1 and 2) are the result of displacement. The change in fabric composition over time is accompanied by increasing thickness (Table 7.4). The table below (7.3) shows the distribution of plain sherds recovered from the various test pits. The presence or absence of Fabric 1 sherds facilitates the delineation of the early settlement site which can be seen in the lower layers of TPs 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (Fig. 3.30).

Two of those forms, 2i and 2iii, were related to the earliest occupation of the area and were composed of Fabric 1. Small (Fig. 7.1a) and large (Fig. 7.2b) variants of form 2i were present in the assemblage. All rims associated with these vessel forms are outcurving. The only variation that was noted was in lip profile where everted rims tended to have flat lips while outcurving rims tended to be plain. Incision on the lip was common. In the upper layers two ribbed sherds indicated the presence of vessel form 1i. More tentative is the suggested presence of vessel form 3iii, indicated only by a distinctively decorated body sherd (Fig. 7.1e). Other rim sherds, all Fabric 2 and all from the uppermost layers, were too fragmentary to be assigned to particular vessel forms although all appeared to be outcurving and seem likely to be associated with a group of large plain globular vessels (Fig. 7.11) which have been reconstructed from large surface collected sherds. Decoration Any decoration was restricted largely to incision on the lip (16 examples). A single dentate- stamped Lapita sherd (Fig. 7.1b) was also recovered but was too fragmentary to be assigned a motif number. The only other decorated sherds, one incised (Fig. 7.1d) and one incised and impressed sherd (Fig. 7.1e) were for similar reasons unable to be assigned motif numbers although the latter sherd may be part of M-motif 45. terra australis 23 142 </page> <page sequence="11"> Malekula ceramics Chachara Mk-3-43 This site is associated with a relatively late short-term occupation located in the high inland area of the Northwest (Fig. 3.16). Cultural remains can be seen scattered on the ground surface amongst and between two ceremonial structures. The ceramic remains recovered from a series of test pits were sparse and indicated that the cultural deposits were shallow and ephemeral. The largest corpus of excavated ceramics were recovered from a mound feature adjacent to one of the stone platforms and is presented in detail here. The sherds appeared to be restricted to two vessel forms with limited variation in decoration. The limited number of sherds (28) recovered from the other test pits showed no variation in form or decoration. Sherds were also surface collected from the site and they further confirmed the homogeneous nature of the ceramics. Several of the surface collected decorated sherds are illustrated and added to the corpus of motifs. Due to the fact that there did not appear to be any stratigraphic variation across the site, the excavated assemblage was grouped as a single unit. All of the pottery comprised Fabric 2, and was restricted to two vessel forms, namely 1i and 1iii. A total of 629 sherds were excavated from the mound feature and the test pit. Of those, 601 (95%) were recovered from the mound feature. The sherds were mainly plain body sherds (497) either ribbed (216) or smoothed (281) with a smaller component of rim sherds (33, 32 of which were ribbed) and decorated sherds (56). Vessel form 1i with its distinctive ribbed exterior (Fig. 7.4a) dominated the assemblage. The upper half of the body has a ribbed appearance where, as noted, the coils of clay used in the manufacture of the pots have not been smoothed while the lower half and base of the pots tended to be smoothed. Decoration of these pot forms is limited to very occasional examples of notching on the lip (Fig. 7.4b,c) and more occasional examples of parallel vertical incision (Fig. 7.4d). The rims are of course direct and the lips are generally plain. Rim diameter ranges from 24–26cm. In the case of vessel form 1iii the whole body has been smoothed to facilitate decoration. The vessels tend to be smaller than 1i with a rim diameter of between 20–22cm. Decorative techniques are dominated by incision, both linear and curvilinear and occasionally in association with punctation (see Figs 7.14–7.17). Punctation occurs in a limited number of cases as a single decorative technique (Fig. 7.15) as does fingernail pinching. Of those decorated sherds that could be assigned to a vessel form all appeared to be associated with vessel form 1iii, apart from the single example of vertical parallel incision (Fig. 7.4d) found on vessel form 1i. A number of distinctive decorative motifs tended to dominate the assemblage, particularly M-motif 4, 16 and 18. It is suggested here and further elaborated on below that these two quite distinct vessels (1i and 1iii) served two distinct and separate functions, one (1i) domestic and the other (1iii) ceremonial. Nuas Mk-3-62 The site of Nuas was also associated with late period ceramics. It appeared to represent a short-term occupation centred near a ceremonial structure located near the coast. The ceramics are very similar to those recovered from Chachara in terms of vessel form and decoration. A total of 96 sherds were either surface collected (9) or excavated (87) at Nuas (Table 7.1). All comprised Fabric 2. The sherd assemblage was dominated by plain body sherds (85 [88%]), almost fifty percent (36) of which were ribbed on the exterior indicating a predominance of both coil production and vessel form 1i. One rim of this vessel form was notched. Vessel form 1iii was also in evidence as indicated by a number of the larger decorated sherds. Decoration was largely restricted to either incision (7) (Fig. 7.6a–c), both linear and curvilinear, or punctation (2) (Fig. 7.8e).

Comparison with the decorated sherds from Chachara indicate a number of shared motifs. Several of the motifs recorded at Nuas have also been recorded from outside the Northwest area. Navaprah Mk-3-47 The recovered ceramics from Navaprah were dominated by calcareous-tempered sherds (Fabric 1) recovered from Layer 4 which were associated with the initial use of the cave dating to c. 2700–2500 BP. The number of sherds recovered from other layers was very few, particularly those with diagnostic detail. Rims and decorated sherds were only recovered from Layer 4. This has limited both the prospects for positive identifications of vessel form and a chronological comparison between layers. Despite these factors the sherds from Navaprah have confirmed some crucial details of the ceramic sequence from the Northwest where several recurrent trends, discussed below, can be identified.

As can be seen in Table 7.5 the majority of the sherds were recovered from Layer 4 and all comprised Fabric 1. The larger rim sherds enabled two vessel forms to be identified. They were globular pots with restricted orifices and outcurving rims (2i and 2iii). Some variation in rim form and sherd thickness enabled the further delineation of vessel form which led to the definition of three distinct vessels. Two types of vessel form 2i were present, one a finer, smaller (rim d=16cm) pot (Fig. 7.1a) and the other a more robust and larger (rim d=20cm) version (Fig. 7.2b). Both featured notching on the lip. The other vessel form represented at Navaprah (2iii) was indicated by two rim/body sherds neither of which showed any notching on the lip. No other decoration was recorded from any of the sherds at Navaprah. Although only plain body sherds (all Fabric 2) were recovered from the other layers of the cave distinctive manufacturing techniques and pot form enabled further vessel forms to be identified. Ribbed sherds appear in Layer 3 (4) and increased in number in Layer 2 (11). These very distinctive sherds are associated with pot form 1i. The other distinctive body sherds (4) that were identified are those from the very large thick walled globular pot (2iv). As noted sherds of this vessel form are smoothed both on their interior and exterior surfaces. This feature along with the distinctive wide body curvature which can be identified on larger body sherds facilitated the identification of this vessel form. The provenance of the Layer 3 sherds are in some doubt as they were retrieved from the large oven feature and may include material mixed from the layers above and below. The ceramic sequence at Navaprah, along with a series of radiocarbon dates indicates that the cave has had early and late periods of intensive short-term usage, punctuated by a long periods of much less intensive use or even abandonment. It is a sequence that recurs at a number of sites in northwest Malekula. The earliest ceramics are calcareously-tempered and are predominately plainware vessels. The later ceramics, dating to the last 1000 years, are fewer in number and are dominated by the ribbed vessel form (1i). No ceramics were retrieved from Layer 1 which post-dates 500 BP.  terra australis 23 146 </page> <page sequence="15"> Malekula ceramics Other excavated sites The sparse number of sherds recovered from the other excavated sites, most of which were plain, rather limited their usefulness. They do however conform to a general pattern which was highlighted at the sites where more abundant ceramics were recovered. In caves where evidence associated with the earliest human use of the caves was present, calcareously-tempered (Fabric 1) sherds were recovered from the lowest cultural layers. This contrasted with the upper layers and in cave sites which were utilised at a later period where the sherds tend to be thicker and comprised a much more eclectic fabric (Fabric 2). The stratigraphy of the caves also confirmed what appears to be a gap in the archaeological and settlement record, possibly indicating a period of abandonment or at least a period of less intensive use. The ceramic remains from these sites are presented in Table 7.1 and are discussed below by site. Woplamplam Mk-3-26 Thirteen sherds were retrieved from the test pit excavated at Mk-3-26. All were plain sherds composed of both Fabric 1 (4) restricted to the lowest stratigraphic layers of the site and Fabric 2 (9) restricted to the upper layers. Two ribbed sherds can be ascribed to vessel form 1i (Fig. 7.4a) while Fabric 1 sherds are most likely to represent fragments of one or more of the early vessel forms (2i, 2iii, 4ii) identified from the sites above (Figs 7.1a, 7.2, 7.3). Waal Mk-3-39 A total of seven sherds were recovered from the 1.5 by 1m test pit excavated at the entrance of this cave. Three of the sherds were diagnostic as to form or decoration. On the surface of the cave floor a single decorated sherd (Fabric 2) with applied relief and incised cross-hatch (M-motif 54) (Fig. 7.13f) was recorded and from the lowest levels of the stratigraphy calcareous-tempered sherds (Fabric 1) including two rims were retrieved. Both rims were notched and can be ascribed to vessel form 2i and 4ii (Fig. 7.2a). Malua One Mk-3-40 The sherds from Mk-3-40 comprised both Fabric 1 and 2. A total of 10 plain sherds in all were recovered, the thinner calcareously-tempered (Fabric 1) sherds from the lower levels of the site, while the thicker sherds associated with Fabric 2 were restricted to the upper layers. The Fabric 1 sherds seem most likely to be associated with one of the vessel forms already identified from other sites and several of the Fabric 2 sherds are clearly associated with vessel form 2iv. Woapraf Mk-3-41 The twelve sherds retrieved from excavation at Mk-3-41 included nine plain body sherds and three rims. Sherds from the lowest layers of the test pit were all calcareously-tempered (Fabric 1) and the rim forms enabled the identification of vessel forms 2i and 4ii. Sherds recovered from the upper layers were all Fabric 2 and were associated with vessel form 2iv. No decoration was recorded apart from notching of the lip on the earlier vessel forms. Yalo South Mk-3-48 Despite the fact that a total of 17 sherds were excavated from Mk-3-48 all but one were plain sherds and only minimal information could be gleaned. Seven sherds with calcareous temper (Fabric 1) were retrieved from the lowest levels of the test pit. All were plain body sherds. The nine other plain body sherds, all recovered from later layers, were substantially thicker and composed of Fabric 2. Several of these sherds could be assigned to vessel form 2iv due to their distinctive interior and exterior finish and wide curvature. A single body sherd with excised decoration (M- motif 46) (Fig. 7.18c) was excavated from the upper most layer of the test pit and resembles that seen on vessel form 3iii (Fig. 7.18a). terra australis 23 147 </page> <page sequence="16">  Pieces of the Vanuatu Puzzle Figure 7.18  Malekula vessel form and decoration.

They were spread thinly throughout the stratigraphy. All of the sherds were Fabric 2. Four ribbed sherds indicated the presence of vessel form 1i. Several other distinctive plain sherds hinted at the presence of vessel form 3iii. The one decorated sherd displayed simple linear incision. Navepule AMk-3-58 Eleven sherds made up the total sample recovered from the test pit excavated at Mk-3-58. All were plain sherds composed of Fabric 2 and were dispersed throughout all excavated layers. Three sherds displayed the distinctive ribbed exterior associated with vessel form 1i, while several others can be attributed to vessel form 3iii. No Fabric 1 sherds were in evidence at this inland site. Navepule B Mk-3-59 A promising surface scatter of 21 sherds collected from the interior of this cave proved to be somewhat misleading. The stratigraphy of the test pit was largely sterile with only a single decorated sherd (Fig. 7.18b) being recovered from the uppermost layer. It showed close resemblance to a large surface collected sherd (Fig. 7.18a). All the sherds were composed of Fabric 2. A number of basal sherds and distinctive ribbed sherds again pointed to the presence of vessel form 1i. Vessel form 1iii was also represented by a single large rim sherd decorated (Fig. 7.8c) with distinctive wavy incision, M-motif 31. Three decorated sherds displaying M-motifs 21, 45 and 46 (unable to be ascribed a vessel form) completed the ceramic collection from Mk-3-59. Navepule C Mk-3-60 A total of only 6 sherds, 5 plain body sherds and 1 rim were excavated from Mk-3-60. The sparse ceramic remains were scattered throughout the stratigraphy. All were associated with Fabric 2. Little information regarding form could be gleaned from the fragmentary remains. Fiowl Mk-3-61 The bulk of the 69 sherds recovered from Mk-3-61, were worn plain body sherds (66) that had been subjected to a variety of post-depositional processes. Sixty-seven of the sherds could be assigned to Fabric 2 while only two sherds of Fabric 1 were present. One ribbed sherd from the upper layers of the site could be ascribed to vessel form 1i. One rim sherd of note (Fig. 7.8f) is that associated with vessel form 1ii. This was the only example recovered from excavated contexts on the northwest coast of Malekula but has been frequently recorded in other areas of Malekula and further afield.  terra australis 23 148 </page> <page sequence="17"> Malekula ceramics Surface collected ceramics Surface collected ceramics include both those recovered during the 1995 and 1996 field seasons along with a varied assortment held at the Vanuatu National Museum and a number of whole pots held at the Sydney Museum. Malekulan ceramic remains held by the Vanuatu National Museum include numerous sherds that have been collected by the VCHSS since its inception in 1990, an original type collection supplied by the Shutlers and other oddities such as sherds collected by John Hedrick and Barry Weightman in 1973 during the construction of the Norsup airport. A number of Naamboi from a variety of sources are also housed at the Museum. Sherds from other northern islands (apart from Santo) are few and far between but again the valuable work of the VCHSS in collecting surface sherds during surveys has provided some useful information. The archaeological excavations and survey work of Hedrick (nd) on Malo and Galipaud (1996c, 1998a, 1998b) on Malo, Santo and the Torres Islands have enabled further and more detailed inter-island comparisons to be carried out. The surface collected material has been essential in a number of cases in further defining the excavated ceramics and instrumental in establishing an initial overview of the geographic distribution of vessel forms and decoration both across Malekula and other northern islands (see Tables 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8).

Similar vessel forms and or decorative terra australis 23 150 </page> <page sequence="19"> Malekula ceramics motifs dating to this period are found from the north to the south and from the coast to the centre of the island. The ubiquitous vessel forms comprise forms 1i, 1ii and 1iii, while at least 21 motifs were recorded from more than one location on Malekula (Table 7.8). This homogeneity of vessel forms (1i, 1ii, 1iii) along with a number of motifs (M-1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 32, 33) can also be extended to all of the islands north and west of Malekula and south of the Banks Islands (Santo, Malo, Pentecost, Ambae Maewo), again indicating regular contact and interaction amongst the inhabitants of these islands (see Tables 7.6 and 7.8). This was initially hinted at by Hedrick (nd) who recognised the similarity of a single motif (M-33) from Norsup (Malekula) with that of material recovered from Malo. Galipaud (1996a:123) in a more wide ranging survey further outlined a number of similar vessel forms and decoration that were found across the islands of Malekula, Santo, Pentecost and Ambae. This region which has been previously described as an ‘Oceanic Mediterranean’ (Bonnemaison 1996:208) shares a roughly similar political structure based around a chiefly system that is consolidated through a hierarchy of grades where men of power come to the fore through ritual and economic tests (which contrasts significantly with the chiefly system of the centre and south of Vanuatu which is based on titles rather than achievements (Bonnemaison 1996:200)). Archaeological evidence of this system is manifested in the remains of the nasara which are associated with various grade-taking ceremonies which are an integral component of the political system. The earliest date thus far associated with these nasara and the distinctive late ceramics as described above, is a radiocarbon determination of c. 550 BP from the inland site of Chachara. Clearly these sites and the political structures associated with them have a pedigree of at least 500 years on Malekula, as do the associated ceramics. What explanations then might be suggested for the appearance in the north of Vanuatu of a very distinctive ceramic style at around at least 500 BP or earlier which at this stage of research appears to have no apparent antecedents and which also appears to have coincided with the development of a divergence in the nature of the political structures of the north with those from the centre and south of Vanuatu? Green (1997, 1999) has more recently speculated that influence from Near Oceania in the form of sustained contact or even migrations of non-Austronesian speakers might well have contributed to substantial change in this part of Remote Oceania during the last 1000 years. Certainly there are clear links which can be identified in the oral traditions, ethnographic observations, archaeological and biological data (Hagelburg 2001). There are similarities to be found in pot form, manufacturing and decorative techniques and motifs between northern Vanuatu and areas to the northwest (Specht 1972). It also seems unlikely that such specialised cultural practises as headbinding and the production of full-circle pig tusks (Speiser 1996) found both in northern Vanuatu and southern New Britain have developed independently. Influence from the west seems like an increasingly likely scenario and certainly oral traditions in the north of Vanuatu talk of the grade taking ceremonies or nimanggi as being a more recent innovation (D. Tryon pers. comm.). Further elucidation, however, of the cultural transformations which occurred in the region will only be forthcoming through further intensive archaeological research both in Vanuatu and areas to the west specifically targeting this period. Appearance of Naamboi Some breakdown in the above pattern of ceramic similarity across the ‘Oceanic Mediterranean’ is seen in the last several hundred years when either distinctive vessel forms and or decoration began to appear on a number of islands or ceramic production ceased altogether. This disruption is characterised on Malekula by the appearance of the very distinctive thick walled bullet-shaped pots and cylinders (Figs 7.19–7.23) known as Naamboi, noted in some detail by Layard (1928) and terra australis 23 151 </page> <page sequence="20">  Pieces of the Vanuatu Puzzle Deacon (1934) which have not to date been recorded on other islands. These vessels appear to signal the last phase of ceramic production on Malekula and although they were recorded in the early twentieth century as being integral in a number of ceremonies, there was no evidence of their manufacture which appeared to have ceased. Oral traditions ascribed them to having been produced by a mythical white-skinned people known as the Ambat (Layard 1928:210). According to Layard who visited South West Bay for a week in May 1915 the pottery was kept in sacred places and occasionally used in various ceremonies relating to the increase of the fertility of pigs (Layard 1928:210). In a detailed article Layard (1928) described and illustrated the various vessel forms and decoration encountered in southern Malekula (see Figs 7.19–7.23). Deacon (1934) who spent a much longer period in southern Malekula, but who also ventured to other areas of the island, provided further details. It seems the Naamboi were somewhat more widespread (further confirmed by museum collections and a single sherd from the northwest (see Table 7.7)) and used in a number of ceremonial activities relating to either increased productivity/fertility, burials or control of the weather. When not being used in ceremonies they were kept in specific sacred areas (Deacon 1934:597). Deacon noted the presence of the pottery in the South West Bay area, both on the coast and inland. Toman Island, off the south west coast, was recognised as being a particularly important centre for the fertility ceremony in which these pots were involved. The pots were also recorded in the central west coast area (Lambumbu) where their function was again ceremonial but related to the proliferation of breadfruit (sospan blong breadfruit or Ambwi nembet). Sacred stones were placed inside the pots (Deacon 1934:597). At Lembelag they were associated with ‘hurricane magic’ and control of rainfall (Deacon 1934:671) and in the South West Bay area they were recorded as being variously placed within or on top of burials (Deacon 1934:649). These Naamboi are generally tubular in form with a conical base hence attracting the generic term ‘bullet’ pots. Large and small versions have been recorded along with a multitude of decoration. The earliest detailed descriptions of form and decoration were those given by Layard Figure 7.19  Malekula vessel form and decoration.

More recent research by Cayrol (1992) has included a detailed description of examples from both the Musée de l’Homme and the Vanuatu National Museum. As a component of this current research a further three pots have been recorded from the Australian Museum (Sydney) along with the five held at the Vanuatu National Museum. Included within the category of Naamboi are the ceramic cylinders (Fig. 7.19a, b) recorded by Layard (1928) which are still used as ceremonial objects in the South West Bay area today. One large globular everted rim vessel (Fig. 7.21c) recorded by Layard remains somewhat anomalous and hence is not categorised as Naamboi. The Naamboi are coil built, with smoothed interior and exterior surfaces facilitating decoration. Generally the decoration on these vessels consists of varied complex geometric motifs created by incision and punctation. A number of anthropomorphic figures have also been recorded (Fig. 7.21b, d). One single example (Fig. 7.23c) appears to accentuate the coils creating a ribbed effect with added punctation in the hollow between the ribs. Little research has focused on these vessel forms since the early ethnographic work apart from the recent thesis by Cayrol (1992) which relied on the ethnographic record both in Vanuatu and other parts of the Pacific to explore in detail the functional status of the Naamboi. The vessel form clearly appears, at least on typological grounds, to have developed from the earlier decorated bullet-shaped pots (vessel form 1iii) found throughout Malekula. The walls and the base of the Naamboi show a dramatic increase in thickness compared to the earlier vessel forms and their cumbersome size and form render them increasingly less suitable for cooking purposes. A somewhat speculative scenario which may have led to the development of the Naamboi is that the earlier ribbed and decorated pots represented cooking and ceremonial vessels respectively. If cooking in pots was for whatever reason abandoned it would have signalled the end of the ribbed form leaving only the decorated vessels from which the highly ceremonial Naamboi developed. This would have had the effect of radically changing the dynamics of pottery production on the island as it would have become increasingly specialised with much smaller quantities being produced. The difficulty with this argument is of course explaining the abandonment of cooking in pots, an often discussed Pacific-wide phenomenon, that remains somewhat of a mystery (Green and Davidson 1974; Kaeppler 1973; Leach 1982; Le Moine 1987; Marshall 1985). It would seem to have happened very recently on Malekula and potentially with further archaeological research in regions where it has been so recently abandoned, some greater understanding of the complexities involved is likely to be reached. The multiple inter-related factors which led to the decline and finally the complete loss of pottery making on the island seem to coincide with a shrinking sphere of interaction with other islands in the north and the development of increasing territoriality across Malekula itself. The increased contacts with Europeans from the early nineteenth century, with introduced diseases and the later labour recruitment drives, would have caused dramatic disruptive effects on the social and cultural systems. Certainly from at least the late nineteenth century significant population decline was being commented on throughout Vanuatu (Harrisson 1937; McArthur 1967; Spriggs 1997:255–260). Although the causes leading to the collapse of ceramic production on the island remain somewhat elusive it is clear that one effect would have been to elevate the increasingly rare surviving vessels to sacred status. The ethnographic record relating to ceramic usage collected by Layard and Deacon, when there was no evidence of ceramic production on Malekula, appears to post-date this transformation to tabu status. Even today, in the south of Malekula, the remnant sacred vessels or parts of vessels are still used in various ceremonial capacities. Speiser (1996[1923]:230) and later Huffman (1996:182-194) both detail the long established trade routes that existed amongst the northern islands of Vanuatu including one for pots which originated on the west coast of Santo then on to Malo to Vao and then down the east coast of Malekula. The archaeological evidence for the presence of Santo pots on Malekula is thus far terra australis 23 155 </page> <page sequence="24"> Pieces of the Vanuatu Puzzle lacking although this is quite possibly due a lack of research in particular areas. However a single surface collected sherd from Tenmaru is very similar to the late Santo material both in terms of form and decoration (Fig. 7.9b) and the results of a petrographic analysis carried out by Dickinson (Appendix 3 WRD-184) certainly indicates Santo affiliations. Summary • Ninety per cent of the excavated ceramics were recovered from the four sites of Malua Bay School, Chachara, Nuas and Navaprah. These sites enabled both the establishment of the two ends of the ceramic sequence on Malekula and facilitated the analysis of the more sparse remains from the other excavated sites. • Ceramics first appear on Malekula some 3000 years ago although the sites excavated on the Northwest coast largely post-date the earliest Lapita dentate-stamped phase. The earliest recovered ceramics appear to represent a plainware phase dating to around 2700–2500 BP. A limited number of vessel forms were identified all of which had been calcareously- tempered and made on Malekula. A single dentate-stamped sherd was found in association with the plainware ceramics at the Malua Bay School site. • Although the ceramic sequence post-dating this initial settlement phase is far from complete the variety of decorative motifs and vessel forms demonstrated amongst the surface collected sherds indicates that the manufacture and use of ceramics did continue at least in some areas of Malekula for some considerable period. It is too early at this stage of the research to determine whether the ceramic sequence was continuous through to the later traditions or not. • The last phase of ceramic production on Malekula is characterised by the bullet shaped, coil made pots that appear to have no apparent antecedents. These appear in the sequence no earlier and possibly sometime later than 1000 BP. The vessels are both decorated and plain, most likely associated with cooking and ceremonial activities respectively. Similar vessel form and design motifs have been identified both across Malekula and other islands of northern Vanuatu indicative of some form of cultural homogeneity. The ceramics are found in association with nasara, one of the archaeological signatures indicative of the distinctive northern political systems. The homogeneity of ceramics survived at least until the last several hundred years when ceramics either died out on some northern islands or became island specific. • Recently surface collected sherds and those held in museum collections demonstrate a much more diversified ceramic sequence than that which was revealed from the excavations. Although highly speculative at this point there is the hint of a possibility of a lengthy continuous sequence, albeit unevenly distributed. • The final phase and demise of ceramics on Malekula is recorded in the ethnographic record and associated with Naamboi which appear to have evolved from earlier forms found across Malekula. • Ceramics recovered from Malekula both from the earliest and latest phases of the sequence are made on Malekula most probably throughout the island rather than at specific manufacturing centres. terra australis 23 156 </page> </plain_text>
