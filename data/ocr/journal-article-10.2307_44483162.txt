OR AT LEAST IT is a significant head start on one. This is not to say that the differences between men and women always favour the former (obviously they do not), nor that the differences between men themselves are not of much significance (overwhelmingly they are). Nor do men lead charmed and risk-free lives because they are men (quite the reverse in crucial ways, not least conscription and criminality).2 However, as a human identity to have, being a man is clearly the better option of the compulsory two (given the universalization of those M/F tick-boxes) . This global generalization about differential power and resources between the sexes is about as well supported by feminist documenta- tion and analysis as any generalization could be.3 Men have far more wealth, power, influence, prestige and control than women. While many men will fall below numerous women on the indicators, the statistics are cumulatively crushing. Men do not have it all, but they certainly have most of it, nearly all the time and virtually everywhere. Perhaps it does them little good in psychological or spiritual terms, and maybe they do not tend to live so long as women and cannot (at least in the present state of medical science) bear children, but other than that, they are the favoured sex. 1 'The Politics of Identity' is an on-going series edited by Richard Bellamy. 2 See the discussions in Adam Jones (ed.), Gendercide and Genocide, Nashville, Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. 3 Joni Seager, The Atlas of Women in the World, London, Earthscan Publications, 2005; see also Cathy J.

This is because being a man is not like being a woman, only the other way round, or in some complementary fashion. For that reason it is not the 'other half of gender, or the 'opposite' sex. This is because being a man (whatever the linguistic niceties of generic human and binary sexual reference) is invested with the image of humanity, the model, normal, abstract or generic 'human being'.4 Against that presumption and construc- tion, 'woman' is always going to be 'other', famously the 'second sex' or - at an extreme - possibly not really or fully human.5 This is not to say that women are never noticed, valued, celebrated, revered, respected, depicted or crowned. Rather that the history of language and culture, particularly in 'Western', technologized societies, is invested with a masculine norm.6 'Man', the 'citizen', the 'individual' is made to function as a generic reference, an abstraction signifying humanity as such, a norm for humans, a supposedly innocuous generality that no one could disagree with just for being a generality. After all, we humans must have something in common amidst the welter of identities (not just the man/woman identity binary) , and surely we need a concept to stand for this? We think we know what this commonality is, because we think we know that we are not the same as other animals, nor are we supernatural (at least not wholly so) or merely machines or arte- facts. Indeed, this is the bedrock of modern moralities, and possibly a dividing line marking modernity from other conceptual systems. Humans in today's world have a clear constitutive 'outside', a realm of 'others' against which 'the human' can be defined, and from which a clear set of criteria must supposedly emerge. Humans are said to be language-users, rational thinkers, moral agents, images of God, superior to other animals and objects in the universe. (We would be quite charmed to find an alien life-form so long as it was Tower', whereas a superior one is the stuff of science-fiction horror.) 4 This point is made in Terrell Carver, ' "Public Man" and the Critique of Mascu- linities', Political Theory , 24: 4 (1996), pp. 673-86. 5 For an overview on this point, see Raia Prokhovnik, Rational Woman: A Feminist Critique of Dichotomy , 2nd edn, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2002. 6 Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract, Cambridge, Polity Press, 1988; Terrell Carver, Gender is not a Synonym for Women, Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner, 1996. © The Author 2006.

What then has all this got to do with 'being a man'? Other than an English homonym that does not itself defeat the possibility of two distinctly different referents ('man' as generic human on the one hand, 'man' as male human rather than female, on the other), what bearing do all the claims to human generality, and the genetically human, have on being a man? Feminists have built a powerful case showing that 'man' as the generic human is only apparently de-gendered, and therefore this abstraction is not genuinely, consistently, sincerely and semiotically generic. Over and over again, in discussions where generic 'man' supposedly figures for the human, 'he' (a supposed generic refer- ence to both men and women) almost inevitably acquires a 'wife', or the noun 'woman' suddenly appears when reproduction is men- tioned, or when the activities that this generic character 'man' engages in are overwhelmingly those with which men (in the male sexual sense) are usually or stereotypically associated.7 These are often said to be public roles, rather than private ones, or political roles rather than household ones, sometimes spiritual roles rather than mundane ones. Feminists have examined the texts and narratives of the geneti- cally human and found that the generic human does not fit them as women. It is never woman-shaped; it is not going to have a baby; nor is it going to occupy itself, first and foremost, with the spheres and activities so commonly coded feminine and associated with women. Feminists have also charted the extent to which women have been excluded, marginalized, confined, exploited, denigrated and brutal- ized, as women , and not as randomly unfortunate generic humans experiencing the 'bad things' that could happen to just anybody, or even to those in certain identifiable economic or other classes in local hierarchies. The generic human who is only apparently de-gendered is there- fore, on feminist analysis, covertly gendered, and gendered masculine, with the marginalizing, excluding and brutalizing consequences just mentioned. This supposedly abstract generality is therefore in 7 Diana Coole, Women in Political Theory: From Ancient Misogyny to Contemporary Feminism, 2nd edn, London, Harvester/Wheatsheaf, 1993. © The Author 2006.

That is, gender (as a binary pastiche of concepts and codes for 'masculine' and 'feminine' behaviour and attributes) is rather more than an analogue to the supposed binary of sexed bodies. There are any number of denigratory references to masculine women, and conversely, some small number of women who were ruthless exploiters of a masculine demeanour. Queen Elizabeth I famously identified herself as 'prince', and more recently Margaret Thatcher no doubt rejoiced when she was famously satirized on Spitting Image as a cigar-smoking alpha male. Masculine humans benefit considerably from their asso- ciation with all the supposedly generic qualities that make humans lords of the earth, and images of the Lord.8 Men, of course, have many overtly gendered roles that they address explicitly, though in general only when they choose to, since, after all, they tend to control the concepts, institutions and agencies through which such subjects come up. Again, following feminist analysis, 'woman' is marked by sex, reproduction, domesticity, emotion, irrationality, weakness, uncleanliness, inferiority, victimhood and perhaps the final straw, a child-like quality by association with chil- dren and by nature. This is epitomized in the commonplace locution 'women and children', or in recent feminist writings, 'womenand- children'.9 Being a man is being the opposite. Not all of this is good or pleasant or advantageous individually, and indeed men are not born, they are made. Becoming the opposite of the 'womanly' quali- ties listed above is not that easy, does not come naturally, takes massive resources, and often causes individual pain.10 The overtly gendered roles assigned to men are in the first instance commonplace consequences of the heterosexual kinship structure: husband, father, brother, son, bridegroom, fiance, boyfriend etc. In the second instance these gendered roles are 8 This argument, based on feminist literature surveyed there, is made in Terrell Carver, Men in Political Theory, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2004; see also Ruth Lister, 'Being a Feminist', Government and Opposition , 40: 3 (2005), pp. 442-63. 9 Helen Kinsella, 'Securing the Civilian: Sex and Gender in the Laws of War', in M.

'Woman', by contrast, is a category of oppression.12 Egalitarian attempts to reappropriate it as fully equivalent to the manly gender are doomed to reinvoke its conceptual role as 'other' to masculine superiority. This does not mean that feminists should not make efforts to validate 'woman' and celebrate women's hidden and undervalued achievements - they should. But the gender order is not only binary, it is hierarchical. Men will recognize their gendered roles, and their place in the gender hierarchy, as normality, and so will all the social and political institutions and traditions that women have to buck. When the nor- mality of the hierarchical and binary M/F system is questioned, as increasingly it is, men have the opposite problem. How can all their gendered roles be rendered in an egalitarian, woman-friendly and even inverted way? If good husbands and fathers are not protectors of 'womenandchildren', if it is not 'womenandchildren' first and men going down with the ship in heroic sacrifice, if it is not male bread- winning and heterosexual 'rights', then what is it? Posing these very questions causes a 'crisis' in contemporary masculinity, a 'problem' with boys, almost anything but serious consideration of 'how to do it differently', or indeed whether the gender binary (with its inbuilt hierarchy) is a good place to start such discussions. Obviously it is not. It constantly asserts what needs to be proved, and begs the questions that need to be asked. Politically this means that in relation to feminists, or indeed in relation to those wishing to 'queer' the sex (M/F) and sexuality (hetero/homo) boundary lines, men occupy all the high ground.

The idea that being a man is even an 'identity' is itself a new one to most men. Why should the idea arise? Men have very little to organize for as men. The organizing is already done, and the identity is normality, both that of the generic human and the dominance and superiority of the masculine gender. It is remarkably easy to flicker, as it were, from one to the other, and this effectively covers the challenges. Masculine gender roles are already natural and good; how could men be other than human? Identity politics, and indeed having an identity at all, are both positioned as marginal and minority activities against the norm, whereas 'being a man' is a non-identity in political terms, and func- tions as some kind of implied 'majority'. Of course men are a world- wide minority of the human population. However, their semiotic positioning as the norm marginalizes this fact, and as mentioned above, they occupy the vast majority of power-positions, thus neutral- izing the issue ... if it were even possible for most of them to see this as an issue. Few feminists have argued their case and positioned their politics on strictly majoritarian lines, which is perhaps a point to ponder. MASCULINITY AND IDENTITY POLITICS Lacking an identity politics, men are curiously but consequently positioned against each other, rather than locked into the solidarities that identity is intended to invoke and secure. The hierarchies within masculinity, now theorized as variant, dissident, dominated and oppressed masculinities, constitute a dynamic and drawn-out ladder of success and failure at being a man. The alpha male may be a recent coinage, but the coins, chronicles and carvings of the past testify to his continuing presence, even if he fell in battle. Defeat, failure, disgrace and disaster push the boundaries of masculinity into its 'other', a conjunction of femininity and victimhood, so there are strenuous strategies of redescription at work to keep masculinity heroic, vital, glorious and proud. Given that the power stakes in the masculine world are so high, and that the inverse of solidarity- among-the-oppressed is competitive-struggle-among-the-powerful, the system strings men out on a lengthy hierarchy of advantage and © The Author 2006.

Batding one's way up the hierarchy, and never submitting to emasculation (i.e. the ultimate feminiza- tion), are the manners that maketh man. It may look (and feel) self-defeating for men to struggle in win/lose competitions, to batde each other for supremacy, to admit to failure and to deny their feminine side. But it would be even more uncomfortable to leave what is so familiar and so advantageous. Indeed the question seldom arises, because the consequences are so unthinkable. How would the world work if men were not running it in their 'time-honoured' way? The masculine hierarchies of power and control are not the con- sequence of maleness, rather than femaleness.13 And indeed theori- zations of performative masculinities are currendy in flux: warrior, patriarchal, bureaucratic/rational and caring/ clerical14 are catego- rial suggestions. While gender - both male/female and masculine/ feminine - consists of a purported binary and putative hierarchy, mapped onto bodies,15 the hierarchical gradations xvithin masculinity are cross-cut, or co-constituted, with other hierarchical gradations. These are within class, 4 race '/ethnicity, language and religion, sub- cultures, sexualities and almost any other form through which humans understand difference, and strive to make it count. It is quite easy to work from the economic and political dominance in the world not just of men, but of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant heterosexual men, back to an identifiable hierarchy of masculinities. These are 'subject-positions', sometimes very complex in themselves and occu- pied on occasion by one person in different ways, which tend to be 13 The male/female sexual binary is brilliantly deconstructed in Anne Fausto- Sterling's Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality, New York, Basic Books, 2002. Her conclusion is that presuppositions of male superiority and masculine heroism have structured biology and medicine into circular 'research' that emphasizes fixity over variability in human bodies, and provides therapies to produce sexual binaries as reflections of what is supposed 'naturally' to be the case. See also Connell, Gender, pp. 40-52. 14 The Vatican is re-articulating its conception of the masculinity suitable for its priests, namely heterosexual orientation but sexual celibacy, as against any 'deep- seated homosexual tendencies' (never mind continuing practices), stating categori- cally that gay men are obstructed from 'properly relating to men and women'.

These institutions could be 'peacefully' religious (though there are many questions how peaceful religions generally are) or overtly violent (as in armies of aggression, even when labelled 'defence'). Some of these positions are occupied by bodies that are identified (and sometimes, though not always, self-identified) as female. When this happens there is an intriguing process of mascu- linization, ranging from denial and disguise or cross-dressing to meta- phor, concession, exception and conformity to the masculine norm, so that femininity can be kept marginal to the whole enterprise. This is not to suggest that within femininities, and amongst women, there are no hierarchies. Certainly there are, but my point is that the stakes are much, much higher on the masculine side, and so the hierarchy is therefore much more elongated, especially as it rises towards the stratospheric heights of wealth and power. Where, then, does capitalism or militarism leave off, and mascu- linity begin? Given the causal connections between social and cultural norms, filtration mechanisms, cronyism and prejudice, on the one hand, and the therefore normalized workings of globalized economic competition and state-sponsored mechanized violence, on the other, there really is no difference. The idea of a woman-centred, nurturing capitalist economy is as ridiculous as the idea of feminized army16 - no matter how many women are in either. If women took them over, they might or might not be different, but different they would have to be, if capitalism and militarism were to be fundamentally disrupted.17 That would, of course, utterly disrupt the hierarchies of modern masculinities through which capitalism and militarism are consti- tuted. What would it be like being a man, if the defining institutions of modern masculinity were inverted? This is a very intriguing ques- tion, indeed one that challenges binarized thinking as such all the way down to the everyday practicalities of identity-being. Could we not all just be 'persons'? Two Hollywood films make the point. Wall Street (1987) is a Bildungsroman of competitive masculinity as the devilishly reptilian 16 This is memorably enacted in the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch of male soldiers in close-order but highly 'camp' (and therefore feminized) drill routines. 17 For a feminist critique and re-visioning, see V.

Female characters are there for sexual services (low- and high-class) , and the ideology of cut-throat capitalism ('Greed is good' in Gekko's dramatic speech) is mirrored in the way the foxy young man learns to trample on the weak (who are, of course, other men) as he pulls himself up the ladder of success. GI Jane (1997) tackles the other major institution of modern masculinity, the military, by taking something that isn't a man, namely a woman, and making it into one. Rather than take a skinny boy and make a man of him (a job for which there are numerous normalized institutions already), the filmmakers take the extreme 'outside', the radical 'other', in order to show in precise and excru- ciating detail what the processes of masculinization are. This process of analysis and representation only works because the material is not already half-formed, as a skinny boy would be, but has in fact been formed already in an opposite way (the highly feminine actress Demi Moore). While feminists may be inclined to see the film as celebrat- ing yet another way in which a female is brutalized by men and male institutions, and the female body denigrated in principle and in practice, there is nonetheless an alternative reading that emphasizes not just the brutal physicality of hyper-masculinization (a synecdoche for masculinity as a whole) but also the relentless humiliation of competitive rejection inherent in the system. Only a tiny proportion of the trainee Navy Seals will finish the course and qualify. The Navy Seals, as ultra-alpha males, are clearly an ideal for the military and an icon for masculinity. The processes through which the very, very few are chosen (because an overwhelming number are humiliatingly rejected) mimic the processes through which masculinity operates in general, and the whole picture shows us what it is to be a real man. While Wall Street and the Navy Seals are utterly remote from the experiences of most men in modern commercial societies, there is one overwhelming institution to which they adhere and within which both the brutality of the military, and the hyper-competitive excesses of finance capital, are mirrored. That institution is sport.18 Women's sport is marked as such, rather like Women Police Constables or 'lady doctors' (or male nurses, which makes the same point the other way round). 'Men's sport' would sound odd; it is simply sport as such. 18 Connell, Masculinities , p. 54 and passim. © The Author 2006. Journal compilation © 2006 Government and Opposition Ltd</page><page sequence="10">BEING A MAN 459 Here is where the ideology of gendered bodily difference (attributed to sexual difference) really begins to bite. Until relatively recently women in the 'West' were forbidden to compete in public sports, and would certainly have had little encouragement in private ones (other than the genteel ones for ladies) . In many cultures this is still over- whelmingly true. Since an ideology of gender-equality has led, in some countries, to more female participation in competitive sports, more funding and supportive encouragement, female performance in sports has not only improved (from a baseline of near zero) but also improved quite rapidly relative to men's performance, though more in some sports than in others. This has led to increasingly desperate searches for some essential différence through which women will always be marked inferior to men in sports (rather than, say, increasingly desperate attempts to speed their improvement right up to men's current levels) . It has also led to seriously difficult and sometimes tragic (and often tragi-comic) tests and test cases attempting to find 4 the essential difference' between men and women in the first place.19 It should also be noted that sports, along with military training, have been the principal institutions through which modern man has made himself what he is, practically and symbolically. The practical aspect is the sheer perva- siveness of (male) sport as a cultural norm; the symbolic part reflects the hyper-competitive ladder of repetitive failure (not success) to which most men are subjected, and to which most submit voluntarily, as the cost of earning and maintaining an identity. Somehow a fixa- tion with the alpha male, shining iconically at the top of the hierar- chy, makes the inter-personal competition (not solidarity), the personal defeat (not victory) and the pathetic (mis) identification with a hero, all very normal and positive. 'A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.' SEXUALITY AND MASCULINITY But for some men it isn't normal, it isn't positive and it doesn't stick. In the last half-century it has become rather easier (though by no means unproblematic, by any stretch of the imagination) for some men in some cultures to break openly with the heterosexual norm. 19 Fausto-Sterling, Sexing the Body, pp. 1-5, and passim. © The Author 2006.

It also signifies the marginalization, rejection, dismissal, demonization and even (alleged) impossibility of male-male sexual relations (and female- female ones) .20 The hyper-competitive hierarchy of humiliation and defeat functions with just such taunts of emasculation, namely 'homo- sexual [man] ' (in various verbal guises) and 'woman' (also in various verbal guises). Indeed the two function in abuse as equivalents, perhaps invoking a classical gender binary of (masculine) domina- tion and (feminine) submission.21 Just as the coinage of 'heterosexuality' as a term took place only after the term 'homosexuality' was introduced, so the 'straight male' (default) identity has emerged in the wake of the 'gay male' one.22 It seems that, in some contemporary cultures, being a man can be done two ways. Establishing the gay male identity is one of the classics of identity politics through which egalitarian norms were deployed against the presumptions, prejudices and strictures of political liber- alism itself. It was also physically demanding and dangerous at times, and in some famously iconic cases (e.g. the 'Stonewall' riots of 1969), openly revolutionary in terms of spontaneous yet organized violence against the forces of the state. In that way it is also classically mascu- line: public, legalistic, self-interested. Of course, many aspects of 'gay liberation' evinced other values and achieved other kinds of goals, notably dramatizing the specifics of care and grieving based in a male community with respect to HIV/AIDS, as well as patient and 20 Samuel A.

Unsurprisingly, given this analysis, gay and straight males have, and have found, more in common with each other than some might have predicted, at least on slightly more than rare occasions. Open transgression of the hetero/homo boundary line has disturbed the normal range of masculinities to something less than the apocalyptic degree that religious, ethical and moral heterophiliacs24 foresaw. After all, the men that at some stage come to identify as straight (by default or when challenged) or gay (when coming out or by being outed) were all boys together. It seems that at that stage, 'gayness' inherent in a boy was not reliably detected by the competitive filter- ing devices of heterosexualized masculinity, so they were not as a firm rule ejected and made to play with 'the girls'. It also seems that later on they could in fact (albeit within 'the closet') play amateur sports or be in the army or engage in the other masculine professions, and that not all wanted to be (male) nurses, hairdressers or florists, as the music-hall jokes would have it (doubtless making many heterosexual males in those professions squirm with embarrassment) . Conversely, the alliance along the sexuality binary that some gay men and lesbians have tried, and tried again, has not proved as successful as was pre- dicted at the outset. Though there is indeed cooperation and achievement, and a measure of success, most commentators see it as an uneasy relationship, for precisely the reasons that feminists have identified: the normalized gender hierarchy puts men on top, even if they are gay men.25 Heterosexuality (or the presumption of such), it seems, is no longer quite so crucial in certain countries and cultures to being a man, given that being a man is in practice the reproduction of competitive and militarized hierarchies of power.

In the armed forces in the UK and in a limited number of other countries, male heterosexu- ality has been legally and practically decoupled from the warrior- protector icon that has for centuries (though not for all time) defined the most powerful forms of masculinity. Again, the apoca- lyptic predictions of breakdown and chaos were spectacularly unfulfilled. Gay men had been there in the military all along; hetero- sexuality in fact had nothing to do with the practicalities and even emotions involved in the work; symbolism, language, history and tradition could all be rewritten, erased or subverted without too much bother, except for diehards, who would eventually do just that.26 Much the same had already happened in both the military and commercial spheres with respect to other insider/outsider bound- aries that had formerly been defended, usually with great viciousness. These were binaries of 'race'/ethnicity, religion, class, nationality, culture and sex, and doubtless others. Naturalized and normalized heterosexuality was built into the gender binary by linking the defin- ing criteria of M/F difference (located within the body, and on its surface) with the supposed species-compulsions and physiological constraints of human reproduction. However, the gender binary was never needed to guarantee or enforce reproduction (which should have happened 'naturally', anyway), and the claim that it then also had to structure the worlds of work and war has also become (in some countries and cultures) increasingly tenuous. This has happened precisely because feminists have made egalitarian norms work to deconstruct the counterfactual clutter with which the M/F binary was invested. Feminists have also deployed these egalitarian norms in domestic settings, and have in fact moved the supposed public/ private binary (within which the latter is said to be insulated from 'the state') decidedly towards overt state involvement in areas where (warrior-like) men had their castles, and (rooster-like) men ruled the roost. Disturbing the homo/hetero binary within the worlds of work and war that are coterminous with masculinity itself ('boys and toys') did nothing to disturb men's relation to the worlds of home-life and 26 See the resources at the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu. © The Author 2006.

The above discussion is not to deny the overwhelming strength and persistence of the 'heterosexual norm' through which the nor- malized concepts of male, man and masculinity are constructed.27 These concepts do not merely presuppose an inherent sexuality that is supposedly biological (either in the body or in the species) , or a majoritarian statistical state of affairs (say, the 'vast majority' of men and women experience opposite-sex desire), but rather they also presume and dictate a constitutive 'other' (namely homosexuality and homosexuals) and an identity-maintaining boundary to be policed (constructing homosexuals as a 'threat').28 With respect to being a man, this is still a viciously entrenched and often violent, even murderous exercise, as 'straight' men demonstrate their identity and superiority as men in stereotypically masculine ways by denying any same-sex feeling in themselves; marginalizing, excluding, denigrat- ing, criminalizing and victimizing gay men; marking them and women a feminine, hence inferior, 'other' in relentlessly discrimina- tory ways. Asking a man if he's gay is not a polite question, and the answer could well be a knuckle sandwich. BODIES AND IDEAS What are little boys made of? The nursery rhyme pastiche ('slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails') is not that far off the mark. In the above discussion I have concentrated on modern 'Western' forms of mas- culinity that most readers will recognize - warrior-protector and rational-bureaucratic, themselves predicated on competitive hierar- chies of exclusion. Imagining a gender binary in a pre-me tal-working or even pre-literate community is a rather different exercise. Differ- entiation in those circumstances may not always, or indeed ever, be binary, including bodily concepts of sexes and behavioural concepts of sexualities. A clue to the modern forms could well be found in the metaphors through which they are commonly delineated. It takes 27 See Butler's discussion of 'the heterosexual matrix', in Gender Trouble, pp. 42-3, 45-100. 28 Samuel A Chambers, 'Desperately Straight: The Subversive Sexual Politics of Desperate Housewives', in Kim Akass and Janet McCabe (eds), Reading Desperate House- wives, London: I.B.

Animals and machines are particularly impor- tant in this further discursive work.29 Both warrior-protector and rational-bureaucratic masculinities are deeply invested with animal and machine metaphors, though not necessarily the same ones in the same way. Moreover, the institutional processes of defence, development, preservation and regeneration require both referential repetition and controlled invention in dis- cursive terms. Animal metaphors invoke 'the natural' as essential, defining, fixed, good and sanctioned by God or Darwin, despite the anthropomorphism that should be glaringly obvious. Foxes are not really foxy, we are; lions are not lion-like, we idealize them in that way. For classical writers like Machiavelli 'lion or fox' may have been an amusing trope, that is, a colourful and memorable way of getting his point across, precisely because it is both metonymical and symbolic. For socio-biologists, however, the whole exercise is much more serious, in that the male sexual difference (from females, not from each other's variations) is variously located in animal territoriality, brutal competition for choice of mate or harem (or possibly selection by a 'superior' female), or even on occasion heterosexual monogamy and attentive parenting (i.e. the overtly gendered roles as 'good' husbands and fathers through which normalized masculinities are selectively and symbolically constructed) . But it is very much a case of choose your animal, and choose your moment. Rutting stags are always popular; emperor penguins are a current fad; male-birthing seahorses could well be next. Machines may seem rather more far-fetched. In practical terms they are, of course, human creations and therefore invested with anthropomorphism. Rather than an anthropomorphism of faces, bodies and behaviours, though, the human qualities are rather more abstract ones: rationality, logic, economy, functionality, specializa- tion, infallibility, consistency, value, reliability, interchangeability, and most importantly, freedom from emotion, personality and will. Aristotle cast human slaves in exactly this mode, and then fantasized self-moving automatons to do their work in their way.50 For all its 29 This methodology is discussed and deployed in Carver, Men in Political Theory , passim. 30 Aristode, Politics 1253b; Carver, Men in Political Theory , pp. 46-7. © The Author 2006.

If it were not so, then 'liberati economics, which invokes inter- changeable and coldly calculating individuals as the constituents of its founding concept - the 'consumer' - would never work. In this way rational-bureaucratic modern man is not so distant from the warrior- protector man of tradition, in that organized warfare and organized trade are not as conceptually, constitutively and practically distant as one is led to think.31 The terms of trade are not set magically by mutual advantage; they are set through the brutalities of military threat and armed interven- tion. Armies that we would recognize are machines, as are economic systems, in that both instantiate logics, rationalities and interchange- abilities that give sense to the concepts of organization, system, achievement and power. The Roman army was a machine (it was not 'like a machine'); it just had human cogs and wheels alongside wooden ones. Modern militaries are not intrinsically different, nor are modern economic warriors behaving in any radically different way in their economic battlegrounds. The boys have somewhat dif- ferent toys, but the idea is the same. Unfortunately the boys have not noticed that systematic organization makes them cogs in a machine much larger than their toy ones (or if they do, they only complain that the system makes them 'feel like' they are, and that the experi- ence is 'iilhuman'). It is, in truth, human, all too human. What else could it be? The last thing they want to do is to say it makes them feel unmanly . . . what would that be like? Well, it would be a deeply feminized world of emotion, feeling, individuality, care and stability. Where would be the excitement, the masculine charge, the penile sexual thrust in that? The penile sexual thrust can of course be quite metaphorical. Female to male trans-sexuals, under the UK's new Gender Recogni- tion legislation (2004), will become husbands, fathers and sons in state-sponsored terms, and boyfriends rather more informally, as indeed they have sometimes quietly been.32 My argument all along 31 Tarak Barkawi, Globalization and War ; Lanham, MD, Rowman 8c Littlefield, 2006, pp. 18-24. 32 For economic and/or personal reasons, many female-to-male trans-sexuals do not proceed to penoplasty, the final stage of reconstructive surgery.

If that is the case, why are there not more women who wise up and buy the ticket? There are rather more men who choose to go the other way. Why? The commonplace (but sincerely held) rationale for sex- change is that of 'being a man/woman trapped in a woman's/man's body'. However, masculinity/femininity here (in terms of 'being a man/woman') is typically held to be some kind of psychological property that is fixed genetically, developmentally or experientially somewhere along the developmental timeline to the present. Indeed there are (at least in some places) apparatuses of testing and coun- selling that establish this to be (in some sense) the case. What is no longer fixed in medical practice is the body, nor any XY or XX 'drives' or species-imperatives, nor any other naturalistic or divine laws or sanctions. What seems so far to remain fixed are the surface practicalities of gender-performance: clothes, toilets, bina- rized configurations of visible body hair, M/F box-ticking, and pos- sibly not much else. Masculinity survives as a privileging structure of marketized capitalism and militarized violence, deceptively distanced from the modern masculinities (including abjected or alternative gay ones) that 'being a man' invokes. Capitalism and militarism are generally made to seem a separate system, distinct from gender, open to the talents, and each with its own rationale. This is a mistake. My trope that masculinity is a gilt-edged platinum card for life brings these things together. These are systems that rely on the production of humans of a certain sort: ones that notoriously rely on others for domestic and sexual services, for instance; ones that distance themselves from their feelings, emotions and families when they 'work'; ones that act out fantasies of competition, brutality, glorious victory and heroic defeat in 'sports'; ones that do much the same by creating battlefields out of homes and shops and bringing death to ordinary people who are 'caught in the cross-fire', 'har- bouring insurgents' or otherwise implicated in the actions of 'their' governments. You can be a woman and do this; you can also be a female-to-male trans-sexual and do this (at least in theory in some countries, though of the co-constitution of the state and kinship, see Jacqueline Stevens, Reproducing the State, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1999. © The Author 2006.

Or rather it is harder work, being 'another way', and still 'being a man'. Perhaps it is ultimately an impossible task. BEING SOMETHING ELSE On the above analysis, the politics of 'masculinity' is non-existent in a critical sense, except for the struggles of gay liberation (only liberating another variant of masculinity, in the main, yet deeply challenging the heterosexual norm), and the more overtly patriar- chal drum-beating of Iron John and the Promise Keepers (which are heavily afflicted with anti-feminist backlash, as is Fathers for Justice) .33 Sadly much of the overt identity politics of men and masculinity reinvokes the sexual binary, the heterosexual norm and the supposed superiority inherent in masculine presumptions about women and therefore the organization of home, society and state into gendered spheres and overt or effective hierarchies. Worse, the backlash nar- rative blames feminists and women (usually mothers) for a 'crisis' in 'real' masculinity and feelings of confusion, loss and anger amongst some men, particularly those in US evangelical religious cultures or milieux. These movements typically illustrate the 'flickering' I have described between the generic and gendered concepts through which dominant forms of masculinity are articulated. Movements for fathers' rights are rather different, in that they explicitly invoke a gendered role, rather than - at least overtly - an unexamined claim to represent humanity as such, and they have rather less grandiose goals as an interest group. Yet typically they argue that 'the system' is now loaded against men-as-fathers in rela- tion to women-as-mothers, particularly in family courts, but as yet they have litde to say that is positive in relation to rethinking child- care, parental responsibility and financial support in a way that tran- scends the usual categories through which men and women are constructed, delimited and set against one another along binary lines. The 'Fathers-4Justicè' website promises a 'bill of rights for the 33 Robert Bly, Iron John: A Book about Men, Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley, 1990. See the discussions in David S.

However, gay dads do not seem to feature. Given the gilt-edged platinum card for life, this near-absence of identity politics for men is hardly surprising. The co-constitutive character of market/ armed forces for world domination with mas- culinity as a competitive, formative and symbolic structure makes critical apathy even more unsurprising. There are many men (and women) who are quite ready to sign up for anti-capitalist and anti- militaristic struggles, and to give their lives for this as footsoldiers, heroes unsung till after death. But for men there is overwhelmingly a crucial disconnect between that struggle and their masculinity, indeed masculine identity itself, and the masculinized nature of the enemy. If the two were effectively connected, then there would be a lot to question, and even fewer certainties than we think we have now. One of these certainties (which are of course constandy 'under threat' and needing defence) is the gender binary, conceptualized as body-parts, clothes and behaviour, conception and reproduction in corpore , rather than in vitro. Considering how much of this has crumbled (at least in a few societies) and yet how much (on my analysis) masculinized horror and destruction continue in the eco- nomic and military realms (fostered by precisely the same societies) , then there are grounds for considerable pessimism. Perhaps if femi- nine (or indeed feminist) values were not positioned by men as the 'other' to masculine impersonations of the generically human, and to masculine strategies of disconnection between 'being a man' and the co-constitutive agencies of capitalism and militarism, then we might get somewhere. © The Author 2006.
