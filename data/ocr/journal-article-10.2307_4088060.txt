<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN MEMORIAM: KONRAD LORENZ, 1903-1989 PETER MARLER Department of Zoology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 USA Konrad Zacharias Lorenz died of kidney fail- ure on 27 February 1989, in Vienna, the city where he was born on 7 November 1903. In- ternationally renowned as an authority on an- imal behavior, he received many honors, crowned by the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1973. He shared the prize with Karl von Frisch and his close friend and fellow or- nithologist, Niko Tinbergen. He became a member of the AOU in 1938 and was elected an Honorary Fellow in 1951. Together, he and Tinbergen founded the subdiscipline of ethol- ogy, destined to have a profound effect on the scientific study of animals in general and birds in particular. The best known of his ornitho- logical studies were on ducks and geese, es- pecially the Graylag Goose. He became imprint- ed on Graylags as a small boy, watching their migration down the Danube, near his family home at Altenberg, a grand villa built by his father, Adolph Lorenz. The other bird that qual- ifies as a totem animal for Lorenz is the Jackdaw. His pioneering studies of the ethology of social corvids (1931, 1935) first became known to the English-speaking world in the translation of "The companion of the bird's world" by Mar- garet Morse Nice, published in The Auk in 1937. In the second volume of her classic studies of "The life history of the Song Sparrow," pub- lished in 1943, Nice related many of Lorenz's observations and theories, and applied them creatively in interpreting the behavior of song- birds. Greatly influenced by the work of his mentor, Oskar Heinroth, and his massive, four- volume "Die Vogel Mitteleuropas" (1924-1933), Lorenz was more of an aviculturalist than a bird- watcher. He raised many bird species himself and was a gold mine of information on avian behavior and its development. He viewed on- togeny as a product of the interplay between instinct and experience, one of the best illus- trations of which, even today, is the phenom- enon of imprinting in galliforms and anatids. Lorenz was a controversial figure throughout his life. To fellow ethologists, lucky enough to participate in the International Ethological Congresses in the fifties and sixties, he was a constant, sociable but authoritarian source of support and inspiration. The Max-Planck-Insti- tut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, created for Lo- renz and Erich von Holst in Bavaria in 1950, became a mecca for everyone involved in the new science of ethology. Lorenz was always deeply concerned with the methodology and philosophy of biology, and the implications of ethology for understanding our own species. In her Song Sparrow monograph, Nice quotes from a letter Lorenz wrote to her that "the study of animal behavior is the only and ultimate source of understanding ourselves." This preoccupa- tion with possible human implications of stud- ies of innate behavior had its darker side.

There was a tendency to view what he regarded as "natural" human traits as socially desirable, an attitude that lent itself all too readily to ex- ploitation by advocates of racial purity. Simi- larly, the delights of his wonderful book "King Solomon's Ring" are counterbalanced for some by the more sobering themes of his later book "On Aggression," in which he argues for innate substrates to human combativeness and the pro- pensity for waging war. Lorenz's publications, which span more than 50 years, present an inextricable blending of acute observation and interpretation. His com- ments on the emotions of animals and their patterns of social interaction were often leav- ened with anthropomorphic asides. In one of his more recent books, "The Year of the Greylag Goose," it is especially clear that Lorenz's af- fection for these birds was as deep as his un- derstanding of their behavior. His beloved wife, Gretl, was probably correct in identifying his fascination with birds and other animals as bor- dering on the obsessive, suggesting a relation- ship with his subject matter that is surely mir- rored in the lives and preoccupations of many other great scientists. He was just as deeply con- cerned with the human condition, and in his later years he canvassed vigorously and tire- lessly for the causes of nature conservation. Had he survived until today, he would undoubtedly have been out on the Earth Day lecture circuit. Throughout his life he was as much a campaign- er as a scholar, a visionary with passion, the likes of which are found among scientists all too rarely.</page></plain_text>
