<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE that the problem which most intrigued Enlightenment historians was "why had the high civilization of Antiquity not led directly to the high civilization of modernity, but foundered in that dark, intermediary millenium ?" (p. 423). Armed with an intellectual position constructed in Lausanne and a methodology derived from Montesquieu, Gibbon simply confronted the problem directly. A disturbing feature of the volume is the number, and the seriousness, of editorial lapses. The articles in French suffer especially from typographical errors, and certain flaws are downright embarrassing. On the title page La Henriade is missing its "r," on page 314 Paul Verniere will find an "s" added to his last name, and on page 466, in the index, Professor Mortier gains a first name which is not his. The articles, nearly all of which exemplify scholarship of the highest quality, deserved more accurate proofreading. Looking at the contributions in retrospect, their appropriateness for the occa- sion is apparent. Besterman's stamp is nearly everywhere, and the volume is a genuine testament to the influence of his efforts over the past fifteen years. Most apparent, of course, is the overwhelming presence of Voltaire. Other factors as well--the Gallocentrism of the volume, the emphasis given to the broad inter- connections between literature and society, the use of epistolary evidence (and here Roth and Leigh must be given credit as well, for their respective editions of the correspondence of Diderot and Rousseau)-illustrate a continuing interest in matters which have played dominant roles in the work of the great editor. Hopefully, with so much of the groundwork now laid, participants will expand the range of scholarship. Central Europe, Scandinavia, Italy, and Spain are rela- tively unexploited areas. Though France will undoubtedly remain in the center of Enlightenment studies, the work of comparatists must be enocuraged. More- over, Mornet's plea for the value of studying the work of lesser figures than the customary three or four intellectual titans of the period makes as much sense now as it did thirty years ago. Professor Niklaus' excellent bibliographical article in The Age of the Enlightenment, while making several valuable specific sugges- tions for future research, mentions as well a more general priority of the first order: studies of synthesis which are based upon the findings of historians of literature, politics, society, philosophy, and science, and involving the co-opera- tion of scholars working in heretofore discrete disciplines. In conclusion, the future of eighteenth-century studies appears bright. The range and depth of most of these essays, and the research of the man to whom they are dedicated, confirm such optimism.

The ultimate concern of this book, in its original form a dissertation sub- mitted at the Free University of Berlin and now published under the auspices of its John F. Kennedy Institute for America Studies, is Faulkner's fiction, in par- 264</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS ticular The Sound and the Fury and the novels which followed it in the 1930s. But if the chapters on Faulkner may be loosely called the climax of the argument, there is a great deal of preparation, above all a great deal of historical and theoretical underpinning. Peper proceeds from the view that while the concept of mimesis, as Auerbach has explored it, is useful in the discussion of late-nineteeenth-century fiction since it fits a positivistic conception of reality, the criticism of twentieth-century fiction needs new conceptual tools. He finds or supplies these in two concepts which go back to Dilthey and ultimately to Kant: Bewup3tseinslage and mentale Synthesis. Bewunptseinslage may be translated as level or mode of perception or awareness, and refers not to psychological concepts like the conscious and the un- conscious but to the ways in which the world is apprehended, ranging from a highly self-conscious rationality at one end of the scale to almost purely physical awareness at the other. Mentale Synthesis translates easily enough (since it appears to be one of the many anglicisms which of late have come to disfigure the German language); but to define it is more difficult. The following passage may serve the purpose of definition at the same time that it illustrates the degree of abstraction in much of Peper's argument: "BewuBtseinslage wurde eingangs als eine markante Stufe mentaler Synthesis definiert und Wirklichkeit in formaler Hinsicht als das Produkt dieser Synthesis aufgefaB1t. Macht man sich klar, daf das Ich die Einheit mentaler Synthesis dar- stellt, dann erhellt die sehr enge Beziehung zwischen Menschenbild, BewuBtseins- lage und Wirklichkeit. Als Ich, von dem erzahlt wird, ist der Mensch wie die iibrige Wirklichkeit formal ein Produkt der BewuBtseinslage des Erzahlens. Als erzahlendes Ich ist er geradezu diese Synthesis selbst." Mentale Synthesis can be described as the process by which "reality" is objecti- fied and thus made knowable: "For each mode of awareness there is a correspond- ing reality formed by it." Hence, in Part One, entitled Historical Development of Modes of Perception in Narrative (Historische Ableitung der BewuBtseins- lagen des Erzahlens) Peper traces first the unfolding of "subjective reason" out of two normative levels of awareness, the Revelation of Scholasticism and the "objective reason" of the Enlightenment, in La Princesse de Cleves, La Nouvelle Heloise, and Die Leiden des Jungen Werther, three novels which, he argues, demonstrate how "what is ethically universal becomes inevitably internalized, per- sonal, then totally subjective and thereby dissolved" ("wie das sittlich Allgemein- giiltige zwangslaufig zunehmend verinnerlicht, verpers6nlicht, schlielBlich ganz- lich subjektiviert and damit aufgelost wird"). Subsequent chapters turn to- American fiction and examine the intimations of "subjective reason" in Melville and its failure in the metaphysical despair of Pierre; or, the Ambiguities; the shift of accent from the metaphysical tenor of the symbol to its empirical vehicle in the "understanding" of the early realist De Forest, in whose Civil War novel, Miss Ravenel's Conversion, the "citizen of a metaphysical world" has been re- placed by man regarded as "a sociological and psychological phenomenon." Having drawn attention to an interesting contrast between the empiricism of De Forest and that of Hemingway, Peper next traces the historical development from James's "strategy of the point of view" and Crane's impressionism to Hemingway's "registry of 'external perception,'" with brief glances in the direc- tion of Camus and Robbe-Grillet, who push the single-minded focus on "external perception" beyond Hemingway, in the case of Robbe-Grillet toward an attempt "to grasp the naked being of things" stripped "radically of all anthropomorphic significance." The final stage of the development Peper finds in Faulkner, espe- 265</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE cially in the Benjy section of The Sound and the Fury, where time has ceased to exist, where past and present are indistinguishable and "the dimension of the future, the dimension of hoping, planning, and liberty" is dissolved in the "in- voluntary, automatic stream of consciousness [Assoxiationsstrom] of 'inner per- ceptions.'" This constitutes a "freezing of mental synthesis" and indeed a "dis- solution of the ego" (Azuflsung des Ich) which parallels the "process by which the concept of time is obscured" (Verdunkelungsprozeft des Zeitbegriffs). For the concept of time is the "product and index" of "mental synthesis," self-aware- ness (Ichbezvu/tsein) its "unit." In the second half of his argument Peper narrows his focus and concentrates on Faulkner, in particular on the "absolute, close-to-physical consciousness or being," Das uneinbesogene 'KSrpernahe' (BewuBlt-) Sein, in his narratives. That is, he explains certain characteristic features of Faulkner's work as the result of a reduction of his characters' perception to this level. First he examines and defines certain aspects of this mode of awareness in Faulkner's major works: his portrayal of women, his concept of enduring, his portrayal of timelessness through silence or immobility, his emblematic use of characters, etc. And finally he devotes two substantial chapters to Absalom, Absalom!, one to its structure, the other, more original and interesting, to its "hypnotic language" which, "with its dreamlike intensified images, its limitless expansions, its negations and para- doxes appears as a continuous attempt to grasp the absolute... raw material of human existence." And he concludes that here, as in the other novels that have concerned him, "the metaphysical question of truth is felt much more urgently than the esthetic question of beauty." The summary of the historical half will have suggested not only the am- bitious scope of Peper's argument but also its high level of abstraction. The book is difficult, partly because it is subtle but partly also because of its highly spe- cialized, not to say esoteric, terminology, which acts as a barrier-for the philo- sophical layman certainly, though perhaps not for him alone. Those who are willing to prove the pudding by hard chewing will find themselves rewarded. But though the basic approach through the concepts of Bewuptseinslagen and nentale Synthesis has been fruitful, one wonders sometimes what audience the author had in mind and whether the same results, the same elucidation of narra- tive modes and their historical development, might not have been achieved with simpler means and hence more gracefully. In spite of his tendency toward theo- retical abstraction, however, Peper never loses sight of the narrative art which is his subject. His literary observations are frequently acute, in detail and in sum. He is well informed, ready to enrich his argument with a wide reference to other arts, as when he briefly traces the results of the modern reduction of "mental syn- thesis" in painting and music. No doubt, his book will be useful to German readers of American fiction above all, but it speaks to lovers of the art anywhere. CHRISTOF WEGELIN University of Oregon A KNYGHT THERE WAS.
