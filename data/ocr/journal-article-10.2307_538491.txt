KURATH Calling the Rain Gods HE Pueblo Indians depend on the good graces of the rain gods.1 The Pueblos near the Rio Grande River in New Mexico receive more moisture than the Zufii or Hopi, thanks to the river and to irrigation, but they too live in an arid land with erratic rainfall. At all times they are grateful for moisture in any form-even a cloudburst-but they need it most at planting time in March and April, and at corn ripening and harvest in July and August. Along the Rio Grande, the Keresan-speaking Pueblos between Santa Fe and Albuquerque need rain more than the Tewa north of Sante Fe, because their environment is lower and drier and because they have in recent times become less dependent on modern jobs than the Tewa. Consequently their ceremonies calling rain gods retain considerable importance. The Keresans speak of the four rain gods as Shiwana. These correspond to the Hopi Kachina, Zufii Shiwanakwe and Tewa Oxuwah, though they are not as inclusive in their functions as the Kachina.2 They occupy an exalted position in the Keresan pantheon. Associated with the four directions, the four important Shiwana come from the North, West, South, and East, and are associated, respectively, with winter and the color yellow, spring and blue, summer and red, fall and white. A special god brings lightning.3 These anthropomorphic supernaturals live in the sky,4 in wenima, which is often compared to the Christian heaven. From the sky they can bring snow, rain, clouds, fog. To the Keres the northern and western Shiwana are the most vital, because most precipitation comes from the Jemez mountains to the north and west. They also give "extended blessings such as health, life, and everything for the welfare of man."5 They are invoked in secret masked ceremonies, in which the masks infuse the spirit of the Shiwana into the dancers.6 In winter and spring they are also called in unmasked rain dances by men. In late spring and summer they receive the homage of the entire population in the so-called Tablita or Corn Dance, termed dyastyekuc in Keresan. The most famous Corn Dances, which are open to the White spectator, follow Easter Sunday and celebrate the pueblo's Saint's Day, for instance, San Felipe on 1 May, Cochiti on 14 July, Santo Domingo on 4 August.7 The startlingly beautiful celebrations have been described in a plentiful literature.8 Hence they require only a general review of the dance events, so that attention can focus on the aspects most obviously addressed to the Shiwana. Course of Events. All day long two groups make alternate appearances from different kivas-the two moieties, squash and turquoise, representing summer and winter ceremonial dichotomy. At the end they often combine. The dance group may include from twelve to two hundred men, women, and children. The special chorus of singers and drummers varies from seven to seventy older men. On certain occasions a banner bearer leads the array, and two goups of sacred clowns, koshare and kwirana, weave in and out among the dancers. Each appearance or set lasts about twenty minutes and is repeated at the other</page><page sequence="2">Calling the Rain Gods part of the plaza, which provides the setting. Each set contains two dances, a slow one and a fast one.9 During the slow dance the singers' chorus leads the dancers from the kiva to the plaza in a counterclockwise circuit. The dancers trot along by twos or fours in couples, with the women and girls to the left and back of the men and boys. The drums give the beat for the step and for the motion of the men who shake gourd rattles and the women who dip evergreen boughs. During a musical pause after the entrance, the singers form an arc and the dancers face each other in two lines, in preparation for the fast dance or dyasttekuts proper, with its follow-the-leader formations. In the fast dance the women follow their partners, sometimes in groups of three couples, through elaborate formations. They cross over and circle. Meanwhile the chorus marks time and gesticulates. The clowns also gesticulate but individualist- ically, not in unison like the chorus. All aspects have been carefully rehearsed. On traditional patterns special songs are composed and the formations are fitted to the phrasing of the songs. The slow song has four themes, each repeated. The fast song has three themes, alternating and repeated in a pattern as follows-A A B B A A B B C C B B C C B B. Symbolic texts are composed to fit the traditional pattern and the particular phrasing. Examples of the symbolic texts and their associated concepts and gestures refer to the Pueblo of Cochiti, thanks to one of the eminent composers. Concept. The concept in all songs follows more or less the following course: 1) The singers address the Shiwana, call them from wenima. 2. The Shiwana form clouds and bring moisture from the four directions (mentioned specifically in parts B of the fast dance). 3) They beautifully cover the ground with moisture and thereby fertilize the fields. 4) The people are thankful for the growing crops (this idea is implied in the term k?ohname). 5) The Shiwana are beautifully talking and singing. The concepts are expressed in highly ceremonial language, which has its counterpart in symbolic gestures. Gestures. In upright posture, the singers gesture in levels which express the intent, as shown in the table.10 As song and concept levels coincide, they follow the melodic contour in a general way. During passages of nonsense syllables, they pump with their hands, usually at waist level, or overhead. Mimetic gestures use four levels, corresponding to concepts as follows: 1) The highest level, overhead, is for the sky, the four directions, wenima. The singer points literally to the direction mentioned in the text. If he is facing north but mentions the west, he points with his right hand across his face, or he turns to look west and point forward. To lure the rain gods and clouds he beckons with a circling of the wrist. To invoke lightning he zigzags down- ward. 2) The second highest level, the area in front of the face, is for the shiwana, the clouds and fog. For shiwana the palms are forward and sway to left and to right. For clouds the hands mold the air. To express the speaking or singing of the shiwana the right hand carries from the mouth horizontally forward. 3) The third level, from shoulder to waist, is for the people, the pueblo, the sacred lake, respectively, downward and forward, with both palms. For 313</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore kohname the hands descend through this area, palms toward body, as this term for "beautiful" also implies "thanks." 4) At and below waist level are the horizontal fields, symbolized by a sweeping forward motion, and the ground and seeds. For growing crops the right palm scoops upward to waist level, or higher. The all-important rain falls through all areas, by a vertical motion with lowered palms.

The composer paraphrased the contents, as exact translation is almost impossible. Each composition varies the details. 1. Slow Song. "Early today at dawn in the home of the rain gods, the mother of the rain makers is preparing her children to come forth to bring clouds, on over the outside world, which is the earth, into the cornfields, at the same time singing a beautiful song. 'I am now coming forth,' the rain spirit is singing. The song tells of the beginnings, has to do with the rising of the sun, tells about the spirits or rain makers, which the people pray to with singing and dancing. The song terminates. The people have gotten their rains. Plant life has received the life-giving waters which the spirits have brought." 2. Fast Song. "It is similar to the first song, with different words. It is about the rain makers, the clouds, coming from the north and the other directions; about the process of forming the clouds, to pay a visit to the Pueblos, to answer the prayers, for rain in the summer, snow in the winter. The singer is calling the Shiwana to bring wellbeing to the fields, where he planted corn, squash. The rain has come beautifully, irrigating the plants. The people are thankful, as the Shiwana sing." NOTES 1 This is a revision of a paper presented to the American Folklore Society at the Madison, Wisconsin meetings 9 September 1957, titled "Invocations Mimed for the Shiwana." The field work in the spring of 1957 was financed by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. The American Philosophical Society commissioned tape recordings of songs and translations of the text. Hans Kurath aided in the study of the Keresan texts and transcriptions. 2 They resemble the four rain gods of the Aztecs, the Tlalocs.
