<plain_text><page sequence="1">Loon magic.-Tom Klein. 1985. Ashland, Wiscon- sin, Paper Birch Press, Inc. xiii + 130 pp., photo- graphs. ISBN 0-9613961-0-5. $39.95.-I am always leery about books that are presented as "not an or- nithological textbook" and are about birds, or are "meant to be read, not studied." The first denigrates the book and implies that ornithologists are not in- terested, are an intolerant lot, or are to be excluded from simple enjoyments. The latter is an unimagin- able attitude for any author. Klein has written a semi- popular book on loons. He claims it is a book for "loon people." Except for a few flowery passages, the book has something to say. No excuses are necessary for the content or presentation, nor is there any reason to be condescending toward the reader-ornithologist or not. The text by Klein is reasonably astute. It is filled with interesting trivia and some wonderful com- ments. The latter includes an introduction to the feet of the Common Loon (Gavia immer), which are "enormous and seriously under-studied"! The book is a general natural history that emphasizes the Com- mon Loon and includes appropriate comparative ma- terial on three other species of Gavia. The text is superficial in spots, but broad in its coverage. There is a stimulating admixture of fact and folklore. There are numerous anecdotes, some unusual hypotheses, and gentlemanly citations of earlier writers that provide a curious kind of histor- ical perspective. There are some problems with ac- curacy and others with interpretations of question- able information. The book includes an excellent discussion of breeding status coupled with discus- sions of environmental change. The environment is addressed again in the final section, which docu- ments the influence, mostly negative, of humans on loons. The recent winter die-off in Florida, which appears to be related to mercury, is mentioned. The chapters are divided into three major groups: "Looking for loons," "Loons through the seasons," and "Looking ahead." The text is interspersed with numerous photographs that range from poor to spec- tacular. A final section, "Sources," includes a selected bibliography, loon organizations, and an unusual in- dex. Interpretations of behavior are cautious, and Klein avoids the pitfall of anthropomorphism. The frequent counterexamples to common aphorisms are welcome and add to the presentation. Klein is scru- pulous in his presentation of alternative explana- tions and indicates often where inadequate infor- mation exists. The result is a lively narrative, colorful, even saccharine in places, and yet one that satisfies the reader's curiosity. There are a few too many puns and unsuccessful attempts at humor. Nevertheless, there is some good reading here.-A.H.B.</page></plain_text>
