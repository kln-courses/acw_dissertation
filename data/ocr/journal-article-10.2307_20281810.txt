Balfour delivered his presidential address, which bore the title "Reflections Suggested by the New Theory of Matter." To what end, he at-ked, did these new concep tions lead? They were often described as the discovery of the laws connecting phenomena. But this was cer tainly a misleading, and, in his opinion, a very inade quate account of the subject. It was not only incon venient but confusing to describe as "phenomena" things which did not appear, which never had appeared, and which never could appear to beings so poorly provided as ourselves with the apparatus of sense perception. But, apart from this, was it not most inaccurate in substance to say that a knowledge of Nature's laws was all we sought when investi gating Nature? The physicist looked for something more than what, by any stretch of language, could he described as</page><page sequence="2">Ato. 20, 1904.] BRITISH ASSOCIATION. [?iwSLwSSSa? 403 " coexistences " and " sequences " between so-called " pheno mena." He sought for something deeper than the laws con necting possible objects of experience. His object was phy sical reality ; a reality which mi^ht or might not be capable of direct perception; a reality which was in any case inde pendent of it ; a reality which constituted the permanent mechanism of that physical universe with which our imme diate empirical connexion was so slight and so deceptive. That such a reality existed, though philosophers had doubted, was the unalterable faith of science; and were that faith per impossible to perish under the assaults of critical speculation, science, as men of science usually conceived it, would perish likewise. If this were so ; if one of the tasks of science, and more particularly of physics, was to frame a conception of the physical universe in its inner reality, then any attempt to compare the different modes in which, at different epochs of scientific development, this intellectual picture had been drawn, could not fail tosuggestquestionsof the deepest interest. If a little more than a century after the publication of New ton's Principia the average man of science had been asked to ?ketch his general conception of the physical universe, he would probably have said that it essentially consisted of various sorts of ponderable matter, scattered in different combinations through space, exhibiting most varied aspects under the influence of chemical affinity and temperature, but through every metamorphosis obedient to the laws I of motion, always retaining its mass unchanged, and exercising at all distances a force of attraction on other material masses according to a simple law. To this ponder able matter he would, in spite of Rumford, have probably added the so-called " imponderable " heat, then often ranked among the elements, together with the two " electrical fluids," and the corpuscular emanations supposed to constitute light. In the universe as thus conceived the most important form of action between its constituents was action at a distance; the principle of the conservation of energy was, in any general form, undreamed of; electricity and magnetism, though already the subjects of imp &gt;r tant investigation, played no great part in the Whole of things; nor was a diffused ether required to complete the machinery of the universe. About a hundred years ago Young opened, or reopened, a great controversy which finally establiahed the undulatory theory of light, and with it a belief in an1 interstellar medium by which undulations could be conveyed. But this discovery involved much more than the substitution of a theory of light which was consistent with the facts for one which was not ; since here was the first authentic introduction into the seien- | tifie world-picture of a new and prodigious constituent?a con stituent which had altered, and was still altering, the whole balance of the composition. Unending space, thinly strewn ?with suns and satellites, made or in the making, supplied sufficient material for the mechanism of the heavens as con ceived by Laplace. Unending space filled with a continuous medium was a very different affair, and gave promise of strange developments. It could not be supposed that the ! -ether, if its reality were once admitted, existed only to convey through interstellar regions the vibrations which hap pened to stimulate the optic nerve of man. Invented origin sally to fulfil this function, to this it could never be confined. ?If we jumped over the century which separated 1804 from 1904, and attempted to give in outline the world-picture as it now ^presented itself to some leaders of contemporary speculation, we should find that in the interval it had been modified, not merely by such far-reaching discoveries as the atomic and ?molecular composition of ordinary matter, the kinetic theory of gases, and the laws of the conservation and dissipation of -energy, but by the more and more important part which electricity and the ether occupied in any representation of ultimate physical reality. Electricity was no more to the natural philosophers in 1700 than the hidden cause of an insignificant phenomenon. But to-day 'there were those who regarded gross matter, the matter of every-day experience, as the mere appearance of which electricity was the physical basis ; who thought that the elementary atom of the chemist, itself far beyond the *timits of direct perception was but a connected system of monads or subatoms which were not electrified matter, but -electricity itself ; that these systems differed in the number -of monads which they contained, in their arrangement and in their motion relative to each other and to the ether ; that on these differences, and on these differences alone, &lt; depended the various qualities of what had hitherto been &lt; regarded as indivisible and elementary atoms; and that while in most cases these atomic systems might maintain [ ' ' - their equilibrium for periods which, compared with such astronomical processes as the cooling of a sun, might seem almost eternal, they were not less obedient to the law of change than the everlasting heavens themselves. But if gross matter were a grouping of atoms, and if atoms were syn terns of electri cal monads, what were theBe electrical monads ? It might be that, as Professor Larmor had suggested, they were but a modi fication of the universal ether, a modification roughly compar able to a knot in a medium which was inextensible, incompres sible, and continuous. But whether this final unification were accepted or not, it was certain that these monads could not be considered apart from the ether. It was on their interaction with the ether that their qualities depended, and without the ether an electric theory of matter was impossible. It seemed possible now that ether might be the stuff out of which the univeree was wholly built. Whether the main outlines of the world-picture which he had just imperfectly presented were destined to survive, or whether in their turn they were to be obliterated by some new drawing on the scientific palimpsest, all would, he thought, admit that so bold an attempt to unify physical nature excited feelings of the most acute, intellectual gratification. The satisfaction it gave was almost aesthetic in its in tensity and quality. There was no a priori reason that he knew of for expecting that the material world would be a modification of a single medium, rather than a composite structure built out of 60 or 70 elementary substances, eternal and eternally different. Why, then, should we feel content with the first hypothesis and not with the second ? Yet so it was. Men of science ha i always been restive under the mul tiplication of entities. They had eagerly noted any sign that the chemical atom was composite, and that the different chemical elements had a common origin. Nor did he think such instincts should be ignored. John Mill, if he rightly remembered, was contemptuous of those who saw any difficulty in accepting the doctrine of "action at a distance." So far as observation and experiment could tell us, bodies did actually influence each other at a distance. And why should they not ? Why seek to go behind experience in obedience to some a priori sentiment for which no argument could be adduced? These obscure intimations about the nature of reality deserved more attention than had yet been given to them. That they existed was certain; that they modified the indifferent im partality of pure empiricism could hardly be denied. The common notion that he who would search out the secrets of Nature must humbly wait on experience, obedient to its slightest hint, was but partly true. This might be his ordi nary attitude ; but now and again it happened that observation and experiment were not treated as guides to be meekly fol lowed, but as witnesses to be broken down in crdss-examination. The difficulty really arose when experience apparently said one thing and scientific instinct persisted in saying another. The electric theory analysed matter, whether molar or molecular, into something which was not matter at all. The atom was now no more than the relatively vast theatre of operations in which minute monads performed their orderly evolutions; while the monads themselves were not re garded as units of matter, but as units of electricity; bo that matter was not merely explained, but was explained away. The point to which he desired to call attention was not to be sought in the great divergence between matter as it was perceived and matter as it really was, but the fact that the first of these two quite inconsis tent views was wholly based on the second. This was surely something of a paradox. We claimed to found all our scientific opinions on experience; and the experience on which we founded our theories of the physical universe was Dur sense-perception of that universe. That was experience ; and in this region of belief there was no other. Yet the con clusions which thus professed to be entirely founded upon Bxperience were to all appearance fundamentally opposed to it; our knowledge of reality was based upon illusion, and the very conceptions we used in describing it bo others, or in thinking of it ourselves, were abstracted from anthropomorphic fancies, which science forbade as to believe and Nature compelled us to employ, [n order of logic sense-perceptions supplied the premisses From which we drew all our kuowledge of the physical world. Et was they which told us there w sa physical world ; it was on their authority that we learned its character. But in order of 3ausation they were effects due, in part, to the constitution of 3ur organs of sense. What we saw depended not merely on tfhat there was to be seen, but on our eyes. What we heard depended not merely on what there was to hear, but on our</page><page sequence="3">;4Q4 ?^?&lt;SS*J:_CONTRACT ME PICAL PRACTICE._ [Aug. 20, 1904. ears. Now, eyes and ears, and all the mechanism of percep tion, had, as we knew, been .evolved in us and our brute progenitors by the slow operation of natural selection. And what was true of sense-perception was of course also true of the intellectual powers which enabled us to erect upon the frail and narrow platform which sense-perception provided the proud fabric of the sciences. Now natural selection only worked through utility. It en couraged aptitudes useful to their possessor or his species in the struggle for existence, and, for a similar reason, it was apt to discourage useless aptitudes, however interesting they might be from other points of view, because, being useless, they were probably burdensome. But it was certain that our PQwers of sense-perception and of calculation were fully de veloped ages before they were effectively employed in search ing out the secrets of physical reality^-for our discoveries in this field were the triumphs but of yesterday. The blind forces of natural selection, which so admirably simulated design when they were providing for a pr?sent need, possessed no power of prevision, and could never, except by accident, have endowed mankind, while in the making, with a physiological or mental outfit adapted to the higher physical investigations. So far as natural science could tell us&gt; every quality of sense or intellect which did not help us to fight, to eat, and to bring up children was but a by-product of the qualities which did. Our organs of sense perception were not given us for purposes of research; nor was it to aid us in meting out the heavens or dividing the atom that our powers of calculation and analysis were evolved from the rudimentary instincts of the animal. It was pre sumably due to these circumstances that the beliefs of all mankind about the material surroundings in which it dwelt were not only imperfect but fundamentally wrong. It might seem singular that down to, say, ?ve years ago our race had without exception lived and died in a world of illusions; and that its illusions, or those with which we were here alone concerned, had not been about things remote or abstract, things transcendental or divine, but about what men saw and handled, about those "plain matters of fact " among which common sense daily moved with its most confident step and most self-satisfi* d smile* Presumably, however, this was either because too direct a vision of physical reality was a hindrance, not a help, in the struggle for existence; because falsehood was more useful than truth, or else because with'so imperfect a material as living tissue no better results could be attained. But if this conclusion were accepted, its consequences extended to other organs of knowledge besides those of perception.- Not merely the senses but the intellect must be judged by it ; and it was hard to see why evolution, which had so lament ably failed to produce trustworthy instruments for obtaining the raw material of experience, should be credited with a larger measure of success in its provision of the physiological arrangements which condition reason in its endeavours to turn experience to account. Considerations like these, unless he had compressed them beyond the limits of intelligibility, did undoubtedly suggest a certain inevitable incoherence in any general scheme of thought which was built out of materials provided by natural science alone. Mr. BalfOur proceeded: Extend the boundaries of knowledge as you may; draw how you will the picture of the universe; reduce its infinite variety to the modes of a single space-filling ether; retrace its history to the birth of existing atoms ; show how under the pressure of gravitation they became con centrated into nebulae, into suns, and all the host of heaven ; how, at least in one small planet, they combined to form organic compounds ; how organic compounds became living things ; how living things, developing along many different lines, gave birth at last to one superior race; how from this race arose, after many ages, a learned handful, who looked round on the world which thus blindly brought them into being, and judged it, and knew it for what it was?perform, all this, and though you may indeed have attained to science, in nowise will you have attained to a self-sufficing system of beliefs. One thing at least will remain, of which this long-drawn sequence of causes and effects gives no satisfying explana tion, and that is knowledge itself. Natural science must ever regard knowledge as the product of irrational conditions, for in the last resort it knows no others. It must always regard knowledge as rational, or else science itself disappears. In addition, therefore, to the difficulty of extracting from expe rience beliefs which experience contradicts, we are confronted with the difficulty of harmonizing the pedigree of our beliefs with their title to - authority. ' The more &lt; successful we are in explaining their origin the more doubt we cast on their validity. The more imposing seems tne scheme of what we know the more difficult it is to discover by what ultimate criteria we claim to know it. Here, however, we touch the frontier beyond which physical science possesses? no jurisdiction. If the obscure and difficult &lt; region which lies beyond is to be surveyed and made accessible,, philosophy, not science, must undertake the task. It is no business of this society. We meet here to promote the cause of knowledge in one of its great divisions ; we shall not help it by confusing the limits which usefully separate one division from another. It may perhaps be thought that I have disre garded my own precept?that I have wilfully overstepped the ample bounds within, which the searchers into Nature carry on their labours. .If it be so, I can only beg your forgiveness. My first desire has been to rouse in those who, like myself, are no specialists in physics, the same absorbing interest which I feel in what is surely the most far-reaching, specula tion about the physical universe which has ever claimed ex perimental support ; and if in-so doing I have been tempted to hint my own personal opinion that as natural science grows it leans more, not less, upon an idealistic interpretation of the universe, even those who least agree may perhaps be pre pared to pardon." Treasurer's Account. The general treasurer's account, presented by Professor Carey Foster, showed receipts to the amount of ?3,351, and expenditure to the amount of ?1,941 ; with a balance of ?1,410. The expenditure includes grants made at the Southport meeting to the amount of ?887. Attendance. It is officially stated that the number of tickets issued for the first evening's meeting numbered 2,600.</page></plain_text>
