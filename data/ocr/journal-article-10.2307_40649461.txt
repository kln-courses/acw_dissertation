<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORNA O'NEILL WALTER CRANE'S FLORAL FANTASY: THE GARDEN IN ARTS AND CRAFTS POLITICS The Arts and Crafts artist Walter Crane's acceptance of socialism and his increasing involvement in political causes coincided with the creation of a series of books known in his oeuvre as flower books. These books have remained resolutely divided from a consideration of the depiction of flowers and floral forms in Crane's political cartoons. An alternative reading of such imagery is suggested, the premise being that the 'flower fairy' illustrations are as political as the cartoon in their presentation of the garden as an emblem for the ideal society. In particular, the artist's encounter with the socialist Countess of Warwick and her 'Old English Garden' at Easton Lodge, Essex, endorsed the creative and politicized flower symbolism found throughout his work. A garden features prominently in a socialist political cartoon from 1897 published in the Diamond Jubilee issue of Labour Leader, a socialist newspaper and the organ of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) (Figure 1). An angel-like woman wears the revolutionary Phrygian bonnet, also known as 'the Cap of Liberty'; she is labelled 'Socialism' and points the way for Labour, embodied by a single male worker, into the enclosed garden of 'Economic Emancipation'. She hands him the key of 'Political Independence', a reassertion of the parliamentary goals of the ILP amidst socialist infighting over the efficacy of putting forth candidates for election. Beyond the wall, the garden is awash in flowers and foliage, even hinting in the distance at a water feature. According to anthropologist Jack Goody, after the Biblical fall, Adam 'spent the rest of his life searching for the luxurious existence glimpsed in "paradise" - the Persian word for "wall enclosure"'.1 As this image suggests, the worker here is like Adam and the ILP promises a post-lapsarian return to paradise. The lines of masonry around the gate approximate the stylized rays of a sun, a prominent socialist emblem of the period. Brimming with roses, the insistent abundance of the landscape within provides a sharp contrast to the weeds that clutter the foreground and, incidentally, shelter the signature of the artist: Walter Crane.2 Crane, a partisan of the Aesthetic Movement throughout the 1870s and, later, a guiding force in the Arts and Crafts Movement, declared himself a socialist in 1884. From that time onward, until his death in 1915, he almost single-handedly created the visual culture of English socialism, a visual culture that deployed the garden as a vital conceptual category. This socialism evolved from the visual and the aesthetic; political discourse merely provided the vocabulary for what Crane was already evoking with his art - a society reborn into beauty. For the artist, his work represented this 'search for a new harmony, a higher sense of beauty' that socialism promised.3 The history of art remembers Crane chiefly as an illustrator, but most considerations of his work in this field refuse to engage with the artist's socialist politics.4 Crane's acceptance of socialism and his increasing involvement in political causes coincided with the creation of a series 2101 Belmont Blvd, Apt.

Charming and original books, such as A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden, from 1899 feature colour illustrations of floral personifications accompanied by verses, usually written by Crane, narrating the arrival of spring (Plates V-VIII). These books have remained resolutely divided from a consideration of the depiction of flowers and floral forms in Crane's political cartoons. Scholars have overlooked the garden-inspired imagery of the political cartoon in favour of an appreciation of the escapism offered by gardens found in A Floral Fantasy.5 An alternative reading of such imagery can be suggested, the premise being that the flower</page><page sequence="3">WALTER CRANE'S FLORAL FANTASY 291 fairy illustrations are as political as the cartoon in their presentation of the garden as an emblem for the ideal society. THE FLOWER BOOKS Floral imagery predominates in Crane's flower books, which appeared between 1889 and 1906. His first, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers (1889), was published by Cassell, with the second, Queen Summer: Or the Tourney of the Lily and the Rose (1890), published the following year. Both books feature colour lithographs of flowers in varying guises. In Flora's Feast, for example, the goddess of springtime awakens the flowers from their winter slumber, while Queen Summer tells the fanciful story of a joust between a lily and a rose for the heart of the queen. These texts were not aimed specifically at children and they proved popular with readers of all ages. Others followed, including the illustrations to the American poet Margaret Deland's Old Garden and Other Verses (1893), A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden (from 1899); A Flower Wedding, Described by Two Wallflowers (Cassell, 1905); and Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden: A Posy from the Plays (1906). A Floral Fantasy is typical of this genre. The text is one of Crane's own devising, an imaginative narrative constructed around his own visit to a garden. This and the other flower books depart from earlier Victorian texts that decoded the language of flowers, such as Kate Greenaway's Language of Flowers (published by Edmund Evans, 1884). In this system, a flower has a single symbolic meaning which could sometimes be inflected by position or variation.6 Crane avoided the universalizing tendency of this system by providing his own verses, often relying on humorous anthropomorphic puns and other linguistic jokes. He described the general schematic that guided the illustrations: flowers 'are personified in a way that aims at expressing their different characters and constitution by emphasizing certain structural features of each flower ... as details or adjuncts to a fanciful costume'.7 Rather than reference any emotional state associated with a particular flower through the tradition of the language of flowers, Crane, instead, looked to the form of the flower itself to suggest its character and meaning. Within this reconfiguration of meaning, it can be argued that these books signal his politicized preoccupation with springtime. In particular, Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden resulted from Crane's engagement with the garden at Easton Lodge, Essex, designed for Frances Evelyn Maynard Greville, Lady Brooke, later Countess of Warwick. THE OLD ENGLISH GARDEN The Countess of Warwick was the most famous aristocratic convert to socialism in the nineteenth century. A well-known society figure, she was a long-time mistress of Edward VII. According to her biographer Margaret Blunden, the Countess delighted in playing 'lady of the manor' and throughout her life she devised numerous charitable schemes.8 Throughout the 1890s she engaged in a series of philanthropic ventures, including a needlework school for girls at Easton and a shop in London's Bond Street to provide work for local artisans. Her interest in the Agricultural Labourers' Union led to the creation of the Lady Warwick College at Studley Castle, Warwickshire, which trained local women in the 'lighter branches of agriculture', such as fruit cultivation, beekeeping, and market gardening.9 In 1895, the Countess experienced a moment of conversion. While organizing a fÃªte at Warwick Castle to celebrate her husband's ascension to the title of Earl of Warwick, she publicly stated that the party was a form of charity for local artisans. Robert Blatchford, founder and editor of the socialistic newspaper The Clarion, published a scathing editorial</page><page sequence="4">292 GARDEN HISTORY 36 : 2 denouncing this view as 'callousness that mocks and laughs at misery'.10 Incensed by this public reprimand, the Countess stormed down to his London office and a heated discussion of the respective value of productive and unproductive labour followed.11 Soon after, the Countess took an active interest in trade unions and cooperative societies and began lecturing publicly on their behalf. A few years later, she abandoned this philanthropic form of radicalism for membership in the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).12 She met Henry Mayers Hyndman, chairman of the SDF, at the International Congress of Socialists in Amsterdam in 1904 and he became her political mentor. The SDF was keen to exploit the novelty of a countess expounding the theory of class war, much to the chagrin of some members.13 Crane, for one, declared his admiration for the Countess by dedicating his book Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden (1906) to her and her Old English Garden at Easton Lodge: she appears on both the cover and the title page (Plate IV). The Countess planted her garden at Easton Lodge throughout the 1880s and she published a description, An Old English Garden, in 1898. Crane first encountered this garden in the 1890s while travelling through the area. As he noted in his autobiography, he would later become friendly with the Countess due to their shared political interests and would enjoy future visits.14 The garden described in the Countess's text shares certain features with the garden evoked in Crane's A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden and the use of Old English Garden in Crane's title signals his interest in the gardens at Easton Lodge. The exact vintage of the Old English Garden at Easton Lodge is difficult to determine. Although Henry Maynard built Easton Lodge in 1597, the family waited until the mid-seventeenth century to create the surrounding pastureland. The Countess of Warwick inherited the estate from her grandfather when she was a child and she did not add or significantly alter the grounds until the 1880s. Despite being a keen hunter, she created a large deer sanctuary and dotted the remaining landscape with small theme gardens, including the Daisy Garden, Roserie, Border of Sentiment, Friendship Garden, Shakespeare Garden, and a Garden of Scripture.15 Her 'Friendship Garden' consisted of concentric circles of plants given to her by friends (including the Prince of Wales), each one labelled with a pottery heart.16 Nearby, the Countess planted the 'Shakespeare Garden' later celebrated by Crane. The Shakespeare Garden, in particular, endorsed Crane's own creative reinterpretation of flower symbolism. The garden contained 'all the trees and flowers and herbs mentioned in Shakespeare. There is a green-brown pottery butterfly in front of each shrub or plant and on its wings are the words of the quotation, and the title of the play in which that particular flower or tree is named'.17 According to the Countess, her reading of John Ruskin's Poetry of Architecture from 1837 to 1838 inspired the garden, as Ruskin suggests that Shakespeare 'induces the most beautiful connexions between thought and flower that can be found in the whole range of European literature'.18 He goes on to characterize Ophelia's presentation of wild flowers in Hamlet as an allegory wherein 'the infinite beauty of the passage depends entirely upon the arbitrary meaning attached to the flowers'.19 Crane would take a similarly allegorical view on the language of flowers. Crane's Floral Fantasy does not illustrate the gardens at Easton Lodge. Rather, it constructs an imaginative narrative around a visit to the garden: the artist is shown in the first illustration 'in an old world garden dreaming' of a floral fantasy (Plate V). He establishes the political subtext of this fantasy with the first image of the garden itself (Plate VI): a beautiful red-headed fairy opens the garden gate for the artist, and presumably, for the reader. In what follows, the artist strolls through the garden and encounters flowers in human form: petals, stems, and leaves transformed into limbs and garments. This tour</page><page sequence="5">WALTER CRANE'S FLORAL FANTASY 293 ends with the setting of the sun and, in the final illustration, Crane returns to address the reader and he again alludes to the political subtext of the illustrations. Fantasy finished, with his portfolio full of sketches inspired by the garden, he pauses for a glass of 'sops in wine' with the red-haired fairy (Plate VII). They drink to 'our next merry meeting', surely a play on the language of political organization. The red-headed fairy sporting rainbow wings and a Cap of Liberty is a reference to the famously flame-haired Countess.20 This fairy also recalls Crane's political image of an angel handing a garden key to a worker from two years earlier in the Labour Leader (1897) (Figure 1). Both offer views into the garden and a way inside, but with a crucial difference: while the fairy in A Floral Fantasy opens the garden, the angel in the political cartoon offers the worker the means to open it for himself. This handing over of the garden to the workers was rooted in reality: the gardens at Easton Lodge, as well as those at Warwick Castle, the ancestral home of her husband, were sites of socialist and trade union demonstrations throughout the 1890s and well into the twentieth century. In 1897, the Countess invited the delegates of the Trades Unions Council, then meeting in Birmingham, to assemble at Warwick Castle, while Easton Lodge hosted an annual Labour Party summer school in the early twentieth century.21 In 1923, she offered Easton Lodge to the Labour Party and, when a deal could not be reached, she extended that offer to the Trades Union Congress in the following year.22 When discussing Crane's Floral Fantasy, scholars have overlooked the socialist content in favour of a discussion of the Arts and Crafts taste for Old English Gardens, a discourse which was itself politicized. Indeed, as Anne Helmreich has discussed, Arts and Crafts advocates, such as John Dando Sedding and Reginald Blomfield, called for the return of the formal garden not only as an example of integrated house and garden design, but also as a uniquely English form of that art.23 As Helmreich indicates, Sedding hints at the political import of this ideal; such a garden could inculcate 'kingly social values' and draw out the 'idealistic' impulse in man, evoking a 'sweeter self'.24 While it remains to be seen whether Sedding's idealism can exist outside the garden, Crane's Floral Fantasy suggests that the garden gate swings both ways: the ideal of the garden suffuses his political imagery, while his socialist cartoons politicize the garden. Crane fused the floral imagery of gardens, in particular the themes of rebirth and renewal evoked by springtime, with his politics.25 The floral imagery of A Floral Fantasy resonates with Crane's political work: when considered alongside the hybrid 'flower maiden' of 'The Worker's Maypole', Crane's cartoon for May Day in 1894, the political preoccupations of the flower books emerge (Figure 2). In the extraordinary floral fantasy of Crane's cartoon, Freedom in her Cap of Liberty has become both a flower and a may pole. As she holds aloft a banner declaring 'Socialization, Solidarity, Humanity', the workers dance around her bearing ribbons emblazoned with socialist goals. Crane transforms a litany of industrial complaints such as 'Employer's Liability' into a vision of natural tranquillity located in the garden. THE GARDEN OF EDEN Perhaps the most politicized garden of the late nineteenth century was not the Old English Garden but the Garden of Eden. As discussed elsewhere, the ideal of the Garden of Eden held great symbolic currency within the rhetoric of socialism.26 The hope of return to an Edenic idyll, and the place of art in articulating this hope, occupied a central position in late nineteenth-century socialist discourse. Throughout Crane's art, even before his public avowal of socialism in 1884, the biblical motif of the tree of knowledge of good and evil features prominently in his work. Crane favoured the orange tree rather than</page><page sequence="6">294 GARDEN HISTORY 36 : 2 Figure 2. Walter Crane, 'The Workers' Maypole', first published injustice (1894); from Walter Crane, Cartoons for the Cause, 1886-1896 (London: Twentieth Century Press, 1897), p. 9. Courtesy: Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut the traditional apple tree, as one legend held that the mythological 'golden apples', such as the apples associated with the goddess Venus, were actually oranges.27 Perhaps the most striking example of this imagery is his design for the prospectus of the International School founded in London in 1892 by the anarchist and exiled Communard Louise Michel (Figure 3).28 Crane designed a tree of knowledge, here recast as the 'Tree of Life'. A woman in Cap of Liberty hands the fruit to the children, who also reach for it themselves and share it with each other. She holds aloft the lamp of 'Truth' and is surrounded by a motto from Marx: 'From each according [to] his capacity to each according to his needs'. Crane imagines the paradise lost by capitalism as the paradise restored by socialism. This emblem pervaded socialist visual culture. A lifelong radical and agnostic, Crane nevertheless realized the legibility of the tree as an emblem for knowledge. As he later explained, such emblems are 'like fossils' or 'well-worn fragments of symbolism in proverb, fable, or allusion'.29 In this formulation, Crane aligns Walter Pater's notion of 'renaissance' with an interest in the evolution of civilization, as advanced by Herbert Spencer in his First Principles (1864).30 For Spencer, the complementary theories of evolution and dissolution represented the 'scheme of truth' that governed all earthly creatures and structures, but especially the natural world.31 Crane combined this thinking with an understanding, derived from Pater, that 'each age has its own view'.32 'The Worker's Maypole', for example, imagines the solidarity of labour as an Edenic</page><page sequence="7">WALTER CRANE'S FLORAL FANTASY 295 Figure 3. Prospectus of the International School (c.1892); from Walter Crane Archive, Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester pastoral idyll deeply rooted in English culture. There is no snake hiding in the grass of the cooperative commonwealth. William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones famously envisioned a socialist Garden of Eden in A Dream of John Ball. Morris's poem, which appeared in serial form in the socialist newspaper Commonweal between 1886 and 1887, dramatized the Peasant Revolt of 1381 led by the rebel priest John Ball, alongside Wat Tyler and Jack Straw.</page><page sequence="8">296 GARDEN HISTORY 36 : 2 The 1888 printed edition included Burne-Jones's illustration, 'When Adam Delved and Eve Span, Who Was Then the Gentleman? The illustration also accompanied the later Kelmscott version, published by the press in 1892 (Figure 4). The phrase comes from one of Ball's incendiary sermons and, as Stephen Eisenman has suggested, Burne-Jones envisions the dialectic of labour described by Morris in his poem. With no class system and no corporate hierarchy, the Garden of Eden is a space of unalienated labour. This garden evokes human salvation and the 'dream' of Ball for a new society. According to Morris, pleasurable and purposeful labour could be realized in a socialist society. Figure 4. Edward Burne-Jones, ''When Adam Delved and Eve Span ...'; from William Morris, A Dream of John Ball (London: Kelmscott, 1892). Courtesy: Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut</page><page sequence="9">WALTER CRANE'S FLORAL FANTASY 297 Morris would later situate this Edenic understanding of labour as part of a socialist society in his News from Nowhere: in this utopia, work is 'work-pleasure' for the happy citizens of Nowhere, a communal expression of both 'the utmost refinement of workmanship' and 'the freedom of fancy and imagination'.33 This liberatory understanding of work, located as it is in the garden, also extends to the gardener. Crane, for one, realized the parallels between the gardener and the artist, as he asserts in his essay 'Art and Labour' (published in 1892) that 'the labourer is engaged in moving, say, earth or minerals form one place to another with his shovel. The painter is engaged in moving earth or minerals (in the form of colours) from one place to another - from his palette to his canvas with his brush'.34 In the Floral Fantasy images, 'Crane the artist' acts as 'Crane the gardener', whose pen and brush create the 'floral fantasy' of the Old English Garden. The garden is not only an emblem of socialism but also an emblem for Crane's ideas about artistic creation: it is a place where aesthetic labour and physical labour converge. Yet Crane's illustrations figure the dark side of the manual labour of the gardener. An early drawing from 1870 shows his preoccupation with the realities of such work: the gardener of a manor house is figured here as Death (Figure 5). His skeletal arms move his scythe towards a bunch of lilies in full bloom. Crane would later deploy similar imagery Figure 5. Walter Crane, pen drawing (c.1870). Courtesy: Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University</page><page sequence="10">298 GARDEN HISTORY 36 : 2 in A Floral Fantasy, reconfiguring this earlier image of Death as its analogue Time. As already discussed, the first illustration of A Floral Fantasy depicts the artist himself, while the second features the fairy in the Cap of Liberty, which it is suggested bears a resemblance to the Countess of Warwick. The third illustration, however, is not the lily or the larkspur. It is the mower, a figure of Time and harbinger of death, accompanied by a couplet that acknowledges the passing of time (Plate VIII): 'And while Time his scythe is whetting,/ Ere the dew from the glass has gone.'35 Both verse and illustration allude to the cyclical processes of nature, the acknowledgement that death is followed, in time, by rebirth. This question of labour would emerge at Easton Lodge soon after 1900. The Countess commissioned fashionable designer Harold Peto to remake the gardens and she offered the gardening work to the Salvation Army.36 Sixty-seven men, formerly resident in a home for indigents, were housed in the grounds and created the formal lawns, yew walk, wooden pergolas, and balustraded pool according to Peto's design. While the scheme provided work for the unemployed, it also indicates that she still delighted in playing 'lady of the manor'. The garden can be a place of exploitation, decadence, and consumption, as well as liberation. The mower in A Floral Fantasy is a sharp reminder to the reader that these garden paradises should not function as mere escapism, but motivate real political action. Scholars have suggested that Crane's political images such as 'The Worker's Maypole' are 'altogether too decorative, too sentimental, and too crowded to be convincing'.37 Yet this very decoration, this very sentimentality, even the crowdedness - brimming with natural abundance and vivacity - is precisely the point. Unlike ironical political images, these positive cartoons do not have recourse to the usual arsenal of satire, parody and caricature. Rather, they gain their power through their very idealism, the portrayal of a better world that condemns the current world through beauty - the beauty found in the garden and the flowering of humankind.
