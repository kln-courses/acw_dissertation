<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXIII., No. 7 APRIL 1, 1926 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE METAPHYSICS OF LEADING PRINCIPLES I IT IS a logical commonplace that propositions which are ma- terially false have consequences which are formally true and that conclusions are often reached that are materially true, but which, as consequences of the particular premises assumed, are for- mally false. For example, if it be said that (1) "None but graduate students are candidates for a higher degree," we may establish the truth of the statement by drawing certain inferences and checking them up in experience. But the inferences so drawn must follow truly from the premises. If from (1) I infer that (2) "None but candidates for a higher degree are graduate students," although personal investigation and the University Register may bear the con- clusion out, none the less (2) is not a true consequence of (1). Or to reverse the relation, I may not be convinced of the falsity of the proposition that (3) "All but aliens are voters" until I convert it into (4) "All but voters are aliens." Although (4) is false as a matter of fact, it is a true consequence of (3). The principles which we follow, more or less consciously, in draw- ing conclusions are called "rules of inference" and are regarded by most modern logicians as valid independently of the particular proposition analyzed or the world of existence in which that prop- osition has its meaning and application. On this view, logic is the study of the "if-then-therefore" relation. Genetic considerations become irrelevant and temporal reference in inference is dismissed as a purely psychological affair. The classic separation of logic from existence is illustrated in Kant, and its compelling influence on his theories of modality, knowledge, and ethics seems to indicate that a denial of this root separation will be pregnantly suggestive for metaphysics and morals. Charles Peirce, the fountain-head of some of the most vital cur- rents in the turbulent stream of contemporary philosophy, (and from whose waters philosophers have not yet drunk sufficiently deep), has offered an explanation of these rules of inference which makes them guiding or leading principles which have been evolved in the course 169</page><page sequence="2">170 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of experience.' They are interpreted not as intuitions, but as habits of thought which, having proved effective in adjusting, reshaping, and reorganizing our environment, have become fixed or normative for practice. These leading principles are the subject-matter of formal logic and furnish, when linked to particular series of sense- perceptions, valuable clues to the nature of existence. If this inter- pretation of rules of inference as "leading principles" active in actual inquiry prove acceptable, it is not so much because of its intrinsic plausibility, as because the doctrine of logical intuitionism which opposes it explains nothing. At any rate, the purpose of this paper is not directly to examine the truth or adequacy of this con- ception, but, taking it as a starting point, to elaborate its meaning and trace certain metaphysical implications which are binding upon all who accept an evolutionary naturalism or a logical realism which does not regard essences as dream figures in a world apart. II The metaphysical implications of the presence of leading prin- ciples in inference are manifold. They run directly counter to the views of what is yet essentially the Platonic school of logicians (Whitehead and Russell), which introduces a sharp separation be- tween the realm of logical relations and the realm of particular con- crete existence and natural processes; 2 to the school of romantic positivists (Mach, Schiller, Ogden, and Richards) which holds that logical relations do not indicate facts of natural structure, that uni- versals are "phantoms due to the refractive power of the linguistic medium," some of its extreme adherents going so far as to wipe out the difference between logic and psychology; and the position of those who believe in a number of distinct formal logics each equally valid and having no point of contact with each other.3 Validity from the standpoint which challenges all these views turns out to be a nat- ural fact, for leading principles of thought are bound up with the beha,vior of things. Put more baldly, our implticative sense, just as our visual and auditory sense, is what it is because of what the world has been. If the principle of the syllogism is true it is be- cause some things in nature have behaved or can be ordered syl- 1 Peirce 's preface to his famous article "On the Algebra of Logic," Vol. 3 (1880), p. 16 if. of the Amerqican Journal of Mathematics. 2 This view was more pronounced in their earlier writings, but that it is sti retained albeit its expression is refined almost to a point of verbal unintelli- gibility is evident in that "first chapter" of metaphysics, "Abstraction" in Whitehead 's Science and the Modern World. 8 See for an exposition of this view, 0.

Any particular habit-and leading principles are cer- tain habits that have crystallized out of a succession of diffused, inchoate, organic reactions-involves the nature of the determinate stimulus as well as that of the specific response. Hence, leading principles-the anatomy of any body of logical doctrine-can not be divorced from structural features of the environment in which that body, to continue the figure, thrives and is able to select and trans- form. Laws of logic are linked up in some way with certain func- tional and structural invariants in the world of existence. It can not be too strongly emphasized that this is not a doctrine of psychol- ogism. Although mind can not be taken out of nature, its presence is necessary to bring certain existential modes of operation or figured natural patterns into consciousness; to refashion situations and redirect environmental fluidities according to laws-existences as a system of limiting conditions-which it must recognize and which conditions the very possibility of its exercise. This attitude avoids the assumption that extreme psychologism and purist logic share in common. That Peirce did not regard these concludions as foreign to his thought is evident in his "Theory of Probable In- ference "' where, speaking of our natural and anthropomorphic (there is no reason to fear the word in this connection) metaphysics, he says, "We usually conceive Nature to be making deductions in Barbara" and that "in point of fact a syllogism in Barbara vir- tually takes place when we irritate the foot of a decapitated frog." The statement that validity is a matter of fact means then that logical forms and relations in their ultimate expression may be dis- tinct but not separate from their empirical filling. This conception if consistently followed should turn out to be an Ariadne thread for some dark mazes of philosophic perplexity. We shall try to find our way out of some of them. The Problem of Verification and Leading Principles.-If our most general habits of response to environment stimuli reveal a "taking-into-account" of a plan or structure in that to which we react and of which for some purposes our own movements are a part, then it follows as a corollary that any question as to what nature is-whether it be narrowly formulated as a question in physi- cal science or broadly formulated as a question in metaphysical analysis-demands for its resolution a reference to a certain "doing" or "behaving" on our part. The word "certain" is used advisedly, for if things possess a determinate character not all modes of "doing" will be applicable to our subject-matter. Nor will those which are applicable be equally significant for the settlement of the 4 Studies in Logic, p. 145-146.</page><page sequence="4">172 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY nature and the revelation of the potentialities of the object of in- quiry. Often the manner of our speaking discloses this conscious or unconscious adaptation of our activity to an external pattern as when we allude to "the logic of the situation'" or "the lay of the land." Hence the sceptic whose philosophic virility has been pur- chased at the price of historical impotence, to remain irrefutable must not only preserve absolute silence, but must refuse to undertake any activity whatsoever. For just as his words take meanings and im- plications for granted, his acts disclose a conformity to certain prin- ciples or rules governing practice. If any one challenged me to prove the truth of the deduction "S is P" from M is P and S is M., I could not do it formally without assuming the truth of the general type of inference whose validity I was called upon to establish. But if my challenger stated his exception or opposition to the inference his very words could be shown to imply the truth of the syllogistic form he was attacking. Now were a "doubting Thomas" to shrug his shoulders without deigning to express denial, his simple actions such as ascending a stairway marked "{only for students" (if he were a student) or refusing to accept a counterfeit dollar bill or donning a life-belt when a ship is in distress, would show that he believed some things were ordered syllogistically. And if by truth we mean just this reference to a natural conjuncture, we need not vainly dispute concerning the validity of the syllogism. In the busi- ness of life, leading principles are controlling principles. Suppose the existence of an object is involved instead of a re- lation. The sceptic need not admit that there is a table in the room -no matter what he says or does not say-it suffices on the view of truth outlined above that he walk around the table without attempt- ing to walk through it to indicate that he takes it as a structural fact. As Peirce puts it, "Existence means precisely the exercise of coMpulsion." 5 These conclusions are of prime importance in determining the 15eld of possible scientific inquiry. Science turns out to be a study of those judgments concerning which universal agreement is possible.6 Unniversal agreement is possible only in so far as our description of nature affects our "action" in some way. Therefore, any subject- matter whose properties are incapable of provoking a certain "uni- form" response or of eliciting some "common" recognition can not assume the form of a definite science. There can not be a science of "color" or of " literary criticism. " Leading Principles, Communicatiou, and the Non-existential 5Monist, Vol. 16 (1906), p. 510. Cf.

In other words, the intelligibility of any definition demands some objective signification. The point may be made clearer by an illustration. Recently there has been considerable discussion concerning the possibility of inter-planetary communication. It has been pointed out that the probability that a message flashed in any known lan- guage will be understood by sentient creatures on Mars is extremely remote. To overcome this apparently insuperable difficulty it has been suggested that we use the language of mathematics. It is pro- posed to flash two light signals in close succession, to pause, flash twice again, pause, and then flash four times-the intervals between the flashes of a given set to be of equal duration. It has been main- tained that if the Martians are sufficiently developed to incline an ear to the whisperings of a neighboring planet, they would certainly recognize the truth of the universal proposition twice two is four. We shall not question this assumption. Now if it is asked how do we know that 2 +2 4 the answer given by the mathematical philosopher is that it follows from the manner in which we have defined whole numbers, the associative properties of addition and the principle of the substitution of equivalents. But obviously the Martians could not learn how we have defined any of our terms unless we assume that the language difficulties which the use of the signaling device was supposed to obviate either did not exist or had already been bridged. Is there then no sense in this notion which has stirred scientists and gripped the popular mind? Clearly, the belief in the possibility of inter-planetary communication (the pro- blem may be generalized to include the fixed stars, creatures in 2- dimensional or n-dimensional regions, etc.) assumes that the com- municating planets have a common physical structure of some kind. Only if 2 things added to another 2 things gave 4 things on Mars would our series of signal flashes be possibly intelligible. If objects or marks behaved there like drops of mercury and ran together our signalling would be in vain. Cognizance of organizing or generating relations is not, there- fore, a fortuitous affair. If words defined "mean " they must "point</page><page sequence="6">174 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to" or "intend" at some point an existential feature in their subject- matter. In physics there must be at least one instance of any rela- tionship defined, or to account for the fact that physics speaks of the first law of motion or frictionless engines which are never exempli- fied or encountered in experience, a series of approximations to that relationship which has suggested the limiting or defining case. The world may suggest a great many things that it does not contain, but what is suggested and applicable is intelligible only in relation to what suggests. If science is an idealization it is not something im- posed upon nature. Its laws are limiting ratios of series of natural occurrences-perhaps ends towards which physical evolution is working. This does not entail the conclusion that mathematics and sym- bolic logic are existential sciences. No, not so long as we are told that the terms of mathematics have no "meaning" in the sense of Russell's famous bon-mot concerning the subject-matter of mathe- matics. If the lines, points, and planes, whose relations are spun out or discovered in mathematical reasoning, are what the engineer works with, then geometry becomes mechanics. In systems of logic and mathematics conceived as a type of order in which fundamental entities are abbreviations for given marks, the type of inference or special kind of implication which enables us to see where we are going in the elaboration of our primitive notions, must have at least one phenomenal reference. That is to say, if the terms are devoid of meaning, then the logical principles or operations-habits if you will-which are taken for granted in drawing deductions and which generally are not given explicit expression, must be characteristic of the way some things behave,-must be evident in some form of significant intention between existences. What we are interested in denying is that there can be systems of logic which are so distinct and different that a proposition in one can not find its equivalent expression in another; or that there are systems of geometry all of which are applicable to space and yet which are so radically dis- parate that a theorem in one can not be translated into terms of another. The "transformation formulae" are operative only because these systems of geometry as applicable to space have something in common. What they have in common are the relations characteristic of physical space. All of this discussion about the possibility of different forms of thought, etc., shows that it is often forgotten that "leading principles" can not be led by the nose. We are guided by them in our very effort to revolt against them. Often the actual procedure of mathematicians themselves, even in the abstruse domains of their subject, indicates that they act upon</page><page sequence="7">THE METAPHYSICS OF LEADING PRINCIPLES 175 the belief that thought and things are conjoined in some way. The consistency of a certain set of postulates or premises can never be established by an elaboration of deduced propositions, but only by the exhibition of an object or group of objects which is characterized by the properties and relations expressed in the specific postulate system under consideration. Any proposition deduced from the set of postulates must hold for the objects which exemplify it. If the group of objects fails to exhibit the characters deduced we are genuinely surprised. Do we thereupon turn our backs upon natural objects and events and calmly continue the game of deduction as we would if we believed that validity were essentially independent of existence? Rather in such situations are we convinced that we have either blundered in our reasoning or have been mistaken in the selec- tion of our exemplifying group. Nature, our actions seem to say, may manifest opposition, never contradiction. From the point of view of scientific pragmatism the fact that we do not accept as a true consequence a deduction that is not ultimately verified by an examination of the nature of things proves that if the agreement be- tween thought and thing be regarded as an article of scientific faith, it is, if scientific inquiry is to continue, a necessary article of faith. And "a necessary article of faith" is but a different expression for "a matter of utter necessity." Leading Principles and the "Paradox of Inference.'"-Logic like mathematics has been held to be either a stupendous tautology or an arrant falsification. It is argued that if the conclusion of a valid inference is necessarily involved in our initial assumptions then we are merely reaffirming what our premises already contain. If the conclusion seems to advance further than the given premises and reveals a genuinely novel relation not implicit in what was given, the inference has somehow smuggled in a formal presupposition or material fact not stated in the premises, and is therefore invalid. If it be attempted to reconcile the necessity and novelty of in- ference by sharply insisting that logical relations are not in time (whatever that may mean), that they are over and above all ma- terial embodiments and yet in some of them, then the fact that logic is an organon, that by its use events can be ordered and controlled and things sometimes stay put, becomes an ever-recurrent miracle. Now if we must have miracles in a nature it is a demand of intel- lectual decency-scientific methodology so-called-that we start with miracles, not end with them. The great miracle and mystery of creation is not solved by the multiplication of miracles and mysteries. Such procedure which savors not a little of occasionalism is both logically unnecessary and naturally provocative of incredulity. Why</page><page sequence="8">176 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY should we get all the breaks? But more important still, novelty in this occasionalist logic is confused with surprise. Surprise is a purely psychological concept which does not possess the direct objective connotation of the word "novelty." Reasoning from the irrelevancy of a state of one's mind or emotion to the immateriality of a state of fact is without a shadow of logical justification. Novelty is a state of fact. Therefore any explanation which would equate it to surprise mutst be rejected. Logical novelty and physical novelty must have a point of contact. This point of contact is furnished by the relations into which natural objects and events enter. Things in our experience "sig- nify" or are "set towards" one another. Why they do-does not now concern us so much as that they do. (We may not have the right to ask the first question.) 7This discovery forced upon us by the exigencies of our environment is a disclosing of novelties. This rudimentary logic of discovery is a stumbling, a groping, a guessing, a remembering, and an habituating. Repeated presentations and re- actions result in the development of a habit of mind in which the invariably experienced association is extended to include other events. The mind set has been formed and the inferred necessary relation between propositions owes its genesis to some invariable as- sociations among things and its validity to the extent to which it enables us to do with things what we intend to do. This does not commit us to the belief that all habits or expectations are realized in nature. On the contrary, we shall see that only on this view does it become intelligible why they are not. In addition, it may be urged despite its paradoxical flavor that this conception undertakes to ex- plain why we both make and recognize errors; even what the range of possible erroneous statements is and where its natural suggesting locus is or has been. Error is never completely psychological. The only utterances that are purely matters of psychological import and concern are sounds signifying nothing. The type of inferential law exemplified in these discovered em- pirical relations may be consciously followed and converted into an hypothesis applied to explain other kinds of succession or followed blindly even before man becomes logically articulate. Inference terminates in novelty when it points to particular ways in which things "take note " of one another. Necessity in inference, therefore, demands the constancy of certain natural connections and, inasmuch as nature does display certain characters that operate continually, e.g., that the, quality of some things is not altered by substitution, 7 Cf. Whitehead, Sdience and the Modern World, p. 31, " . . . the sheer statement of what things are may contain elements explanatory of why things are.)"</page><page sequence="9">TIlE METAPHYSICS OF LEADING PRINCIPLES 177 we hypostasize these laws of things into necessary laws of thouight. Since the world has had a history, novelty in inference does not now disclose new kinds or types of natural linkage or correlation, but in- stead lays bare discovered instances which permit themselves to be subsumed under patterns and matrices already ascertained to obtain among other objects. There is a widening in extent-in physical com- prehension. If new types of natural activity were discovered this would be tantamount to the generation of new leading principles, and although the possibility of falling into new habits of thought is not altogether precluded, the scientific work of today is engaged in extending known leading principles from one field to another. Novelty, as a consequence, is never completely a psychological mat- ter, for even in its most restricted physical sense it implies the ex- tension of the factual domain of a certain series of organizing re- lations to particulars. What, then, it may be asked, is certainty in inference? The only response that can be made is that certainty is the knowledge that the guiding principles which we have followed in the past, implicitly or not, have given us conclusions about the way which things hang or hold together that have been verified in experience. The logic of demonstration is an elaboration of these leading principles. Our knowledge of the structure or order of nature (the "harmony of logical rationality" in Whitehead's high-sounding phrase) has been born in a shock, strengthened by a guess, and fixed through a habit. The logic of demonstration is the logic of discovery grown cold. III Before going on to examine the bearing of these considerations upon a theory of probability, I wish to stop to forestall a possible objection or two that may be levelled against the doctrine set forth so far. (1) It has been said that, inasmuch as logical operations can be performed upon any material submitted irrespective of the specific characters exhibited, there can be no relation between logical form and empirical content. The multiplication table is applicable to both beans and brains, etc. Therefore, it has been concluded that the mathematical sciences are not only utterly independent of any existence, but of all existence. The reasoning is clearly fallacious. It does not follow that because rules of inference are applicable to any subject-matter they are independent of all subject-matter, any more than that my thought is independent of all language because I can make myself understood in every language. Freedom is always relative to the range in which it exercises choice. One can not do bet-</page><page sequence="10">178 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ter in this connection than to recall Bradley's observation that, "You can not conclude because a male proves fertile with every known female, that he therefore supplies the principle of fertility." (2) A necessary presupposition of scientific method is that false statements have definite implications. Otherwise we could not check up upon any description or explanation offered of natural events. Confronted by two conflicting hypotheses both of which can not be true we may reject one or the other or both by searching for cer- tain characters of physical phenomena, or modes of organic behavior whose existence is entailed by the supposition of the truth of the hypotheses. This proves that the domains of logical validity and existence are not coincident, but that the latter is subsumed under t'he former. Does it not therefore follow that the realm of logical meaning is distinct, separate, and prior to the natural world? This is but a circuitous way of saying that many more propositions are false of nature than are true of it. But this fact if it is not to give rise to a different expression of the fallacy outlined above, far from being fatal to our view, really confirms it. How do we determine whether a proposition is false? Not by inspection, but by implica- tion, and the implication to be recognizable must be of a type which is evidenced in some experienced context. Every useful hypothesis prescribes to the experimental physicist certain practical manipula- tions. He may not find what he is seeking. But he becomes conscious of the absence of what he has sought only because physical be- havior is different from what he has expected it to be. What he has expected it to be depends upon the general form of relations which have already been suggested or realized by some other things. It should be carefully noted that this is not equivalent to saying that all that is conceivable or possible must be or have been actual. It is saying that all that is conceivable or possible can only be under- stood in relation to the actual. This is a vindication of the funda- mental insight of Aristotle and Hegel concerning the nature of po- tentiality. Existence exercises coercion, brutal and direct upon our acts, subtle and recondite on our thought-a coercion which is none the less real for being unavowed or denied. IV If different types of implication are possible, then the material world which furnishes exemplifications of them must possess certain generic characters that can not be explained in terms of one another. For example, the fact that probable inferences have validity indicates that the world in which they work out must display traits of chance and law-determinateness in some respects, indetermination in oth-</page><page sequence="11">THE METAPHYSICS OF LEADING PRINCIPLES 179 ers. Whatever we discover the categories to be, we are impelled to find out what types of inference each predetermines. Therefore in its ultimate foundations, logic becomes metaphysics.8 This may not be a startling conclusion, but it is an important one. Historically, logical systems have not only shown metaphysical lean- ings, but have been openly erected upon metaphysical foundations. It is evident that even the recent tendencies in philosophic thought which are an outgrowth of the "logistic" movement and which deny the ultimate equivalence of logic and metaphysics imply some form of atomism or monadism. The metaphysical implication of the pragma- tist-realist logic of leading principles is an open universe in which there is an element of radical indetermination, in which physical con- stants are limits of variation and physical laws summations and prognostication of the direction of physical flux. For reasons that will soon appear, an open universe is a growing universe and there- fore it does not necessarily follow that all types of implication have already been discovered. To deny this would be to forget that the world was made before the English language. Nor can we say if implication is bound up in some way with the behavior-patterns of things that all types of inferential connection have already been evolved unless we hold that all behavior-patterns are fixed and ex- hausted. Logic can never be a closed system so long as science is not. On this view probable inference is a judgment that has relation to some existential frequencies. Hence, the probability relations which hold for the segment of the universe under direct observation may not hold for other segments any more than terrestrial physics and chemistery must hold for all bodies in stellar space. A disregard of this elementary consideration has been responsible for a great many errors in discussing the problem of design-of fixed and opera- tive ends in nature. This position, which is still the stronghold of rational theology, now flies the banner of natural teleology or fit- ness. It is based upon an unqualified acceptance of an a priori con- ception of probability which makes the probability relation a measure of our ignorance-a view whose palpable falsity is evidenced by every prediction science has made. Far from being a measure of our ig- norance, exactly the opposite is true. Complete ignorance can never be a basis for knowledge and intelligent prediction demands a limited degree of both. In fields in which statistical methods have proved most fruitful the probability of an event is an index of the known truth-frequencies of the series of events of which it is a member. The approximate truth-frequency in every case is a fact of experience with which we are already acquainted. 8 Cf. Dewey, Nature and Experience, p. 51. "Metaphysics is cognizance of the generic traits of existence " (my italics).</page><page sequence="12">180 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It would be singularly instructive to examine the influence which the psychological theory of inverse probability has exercised upon types of metaphysical systems which have divorced validity from all reference to existence. Here, we can only examine the concept of equiprobability and demonstrate that a failure to analyze and define this term vitiates the speculations of those who, starting with certain instincts of credence, interpret probabilities as degrees of expectation. Consider the oft-twirled penny. An even wager that it falls head up on any one toss is an instance of a subjective probability judg- ment. No odds are given, for the probability of the occurrence of the event is regarded as one half. Why? Because inasmuch as there are two faces there are only two possibilities and both are equally likely to happen. How is it known, it is asked, that both possibilities are equally likely to happen ? This can not be a self-evident proposi- tion, for certainly our lives seem to be ordered on the belief that pos- sibilities are not all equally likely to happen. As a matter of fact, ?xperienced gamblers before joining a game watch the cards or dice for a few minutes. They know that not all points can be made with equal frequency with every set of dice. To invoke equiprobability for an event about whose class distribution we know nothing is really but a disguised attempt to deduce existence-to extract particulars out of a magician's hat of universals-to produce facts by juggling with hypotheses. In the specific case in question we know that heads and tails are equally probable because we already have knowledge that in extended series of tosses the frequencies of their occurrence tend to equality as the number of throws increases. But it must be borne in mind that this knowledge only justifies our predictions concerning the relative distribution of series of events and can not be stretched to predict the result of individual trials which remain indeterminate. Still more important is the conclusion that prob- ability judgments can only be made of series of events which con- tain instances of the occurrence and non-occurrence of the charac- ter under investigation, otherwise the phrase "equally likely" be- comes meaningless. And for our purposes, most important of all is the conclusion that the arrangement of nature or the order of the universe can never become the subject of a probability judgment, since there is only one universe with which we are acquainted and not a series of them. The subjective theory of probable inference is the Achilles' heel of the argument from design. Strictly speaking, then, an open universe in which all possibilities may be realized is a limiting condition of the origin of existence and not its goal. All possibilities are open at the beginning, but as ex-</page><page sequence="13">THE METAPHYSICS OF LEADING PRINCIPLES 181 istence acquires fixed characters and tendencies its development de- mands a limitation of possibilities in most directions and a furthering of possibilities in others. Vistas broaden more naturally than they multiply. Yet development makes ideals and goals more attainable, for though it sets limits to the exercise of our choice it fortifies that choice when once made. The implications of this principle for a theory of social develop- ment are enormous. A bare mention must suffice us here. If de- velopment implies a limitation of possibilities, then the should be must be conceived and interpreted as a possibility of what is demand- ing an alteration or adjustment of the given or existent. Superna- tural ethical sanctions turn out to be cruelly irrelevant or hypostases of specific social needs. Institutionalized activities which in the course of time have narrowed and straitened the spirit and pur- poses which they once gratified must be given new twists or direc- tions in their development if they are to hold forth the promise of new possibilities. Social philosophy becomes an ideological expres- sion of social apologeties, social revision or social revolution. In the words of Marx's gloss on Feurbach, "Philosophers have only inter- preted the world differently, but the point is to change it." The tragedies of living, as distinct from the tragedy of life, arise from the problems of evils, not from the problem of evil. On the other hand, the entire world can not be remade at once. It has a history and a memory in which the things of the present are bathed. Reform or revolution become most effective, therefore, not when they are expressions of blind revolt against intolerable abuses, but when they are resolutely undertaken at the behest of a social theory. A social movement, therefore, must be based not only on a social ideal, although that is a sine qua non, but upon a body of social knowledge. Not only is it true that the world can not be re- made in its entirety, it can not even be completely rethought or re- imagined. If this be questioned, I challenge any one to see in his mind's eye a color never beheld in experience before. V Naturally, the foregoing is not without significance for a meta- physics of knowledge.9 Knowledge implies differentiation. It is always knowledge of. Therefore, knowledge itself can never be the subject-matter of investigation in the sense in which it is asked how knowledge in general is possible. If this is denied, then inasmuch as knowing is a state of mind and as a state of mind a possible 9 It will be apparent that in this section especially I have taken my orienta- tion from the writings of Professors Dewey and Woodbridge.</page><page sequence="14">182 JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY subject-matter of inquiry, it follows that some states of mind emptied of all content may be knowledge. This is tantamount to saying that we might have knowledge even if there were no things which we could have knowledge about. The things of which we have knowledge must be identifiable or recognizable. We must be able, if questioned long enough as to what we have knowledge about, to utter "Behold," or to point. This uttering or pointing is not yet knowledge, but it is a necessary con- dition of intelligible speech. Statements made about a subject-matter which can not be indicated, exhibited, or suggested in some way are not conveyors of knowledge. They are strings of words-meaning- less-because signifying neither things, nor events, nor forms of behavior. They do not give even false knowledge, for to know that a proposition is untrue we must first know what it means. The other condition of intelligibility is that the subject-matter of inquiry must be introduced into a net of meanings, the fretwork of whose logical relations reveals characters and qualities, the ex- istence of which has not yet been suspected or displayed in our sub- ject-matter. This verification is possible only if, as our knowledge grows, the characters and qualities of which we have knowledge do not grow at the same time. Knowledge of the characters or relations of the objects of inquiry is expressed in propositions. The truth of propositions is established by returning from description of logical relations and the organiza- tion of their implications to aequaintance with existences. Without dipping back into the stream of experience no elaboration of formal implications can furnish canons of verification. Our points of de- parture and return must be located in concrete situations. Usually, verifiability involves a transformation of our environment, a bridg- ing of gaps and lacunae in experience, but this can only be effected in virtue of certain objective structural permanencies or natural con- formations that condition practical manipulation. To anyone -hold- ing this view of knowledge and truth, Bradley's famous question about the sweetness and whiteness of a lump of sugar becomes mean- ingless. The proposition "Sugar is sweet" implies other proposi- tions. These propositions can never prove the truth of the first statement, they can only indicate how the truth of that statement can be established, e.g., by sugaring our tea or coffee. If knowledge is, a finished product for "how can we know" we must read "how do we know." Otherwise knowledge is a mystery and truth a miracle. But if we do not make a problem of how a glove fits a hand we ought not to make a problem of our knowledge that it does.10 10 Cf.

This is concealed from them because the terms of their inquiry are too general. To ask, as for instance Huxley does, what we know about "matter" or "motion" as distinct from the laws of matter and motion or the relation of any particular matter or particular motion is to make impossible an answer in any other terms than mat- ter or motion. Hence, epistemological arguments formulated this way must of necessity be circular. To investigate "knowledge-at- large" is impossible without assuming specific knowledge in terms of which the explanation is made. The fallacy in the reasoning is similar to the fallacy of those who believe that the canons of scientific method demand that they doubt every thing at the outset. They lose sight of the fact that we can doubt any one thing only because of what we know of other things just as we can explain our knowledge of a thing only in terms of other things we already know. At the risk of being irreverent, I should say that Descartes, often called the father of modern phi- losophy, is more truly, because of his procedure in this respect, the father of modern confusion. The method of universal doubt has a surface honesty about it which conceals the assumptions and beliefs that condition intelligible inquiry in any specific case-assumptions that may be all the more pernicious for not being explicit.1' If significant doubt and denial must be based on some kind of knowledge, then skepticism is not the foundation of science, but its crown. SIDNEY HOOK. BROOKLYN, ~TEW YORK. we seek the light of external facts, the only cases of thought which we can find are of thought in signs. Plainly, no other thought can be evidenced by external facts. But we have seen that only by external facts can thought be known at all. The only, thought, then, which can possibly be cognized is thought in signs. But thought which can not be cognized does not exist. All thought, therefore, must necessarily be in signs. . . . From the proposition that every thought is a sign, it follows that every thought must address itself to some other, must de- termine some other, since that is the essence of a sign." 11 Peirce, speaking of Descartes, says: "Verily, had he included among his doubts a very strong doubt whether he was really doubting the while, his state of mind would have been less childish," Nation, Vol. 82, No. 2125, in an un- signed review of Haldane 's Descartes.</page></plain_text>
