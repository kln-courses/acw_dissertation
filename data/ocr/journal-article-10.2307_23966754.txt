<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES "THE FORM OF GOD" (PHIL. 2:6) VARIATIONS ON A THEME OF JEWISH MYSTICISM I.I. INTRODUCTION1 Like the proverbial vultures over a carcass, twentieth-century New Testament scholars have tenaciously continued to congregate around the supposed 'hymn' of Phil. 2:5-11. As a result, this passage is one of the most over-interpreted texts of the New Testament. Other canonical Christian texts are of similar poetic grandeur and force, and others have had a significant effect on the history of the church: but few if any have in living memory received even a comparable amount of scholarly attention. We have come to the point where none but the most conceited could claim to have mastered the secondary literature, and none but the dullest would find pleasure or interest in wading through it. One well-known 1983 monograph on Phil. 2:5-11 and its modern history of interpretation was 320 pages long and had a biblio graphy of 500 items; at least another hundred items could now easily be added.2 Most published treatments have become highly selective; perhaps one of the last attempts at a reasonably compre hensive discussion of even a single issue in Phil. 2:6-11 was Ν. T. Wright's widely admired 1986 article on the twenty possible mean ings of the word άρπαγμός in verse 6.3 A comprehensive treatment of the whole passage now seems scarcely possible—or, dare one say it, even desirable. The number of angels on the head of a pin may be subject to dispute; but there can be little doubt about the camel loads of interpretation on this passage which the twentieth century has thought it necessary to carry to the door of the great apostolic tentmaker and his suppliers. The purpose of the present article is not to add to the cacophony 1 This study was first presented as a New Testament seminar paper in the autumn of 1995 at the University of Cambridge and at King's College, London.

BOCKMUEHL of dissonant strophic analyses and original settings. Instead, in a somewhat unguarded and playful mode it queries several widely accepted interpretations of the phrase μορφή 9eov (v. 6), in order then to propose an alternative which, with several variations, arises and finds development in the Jewish and Christian mystical traditions. II.II. A FEW WORKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PHIL. 2:5-11 To clear the ground, it is perhaps worth acknowledging a few uncommon assumptions that are made in this study about the passage as a whole. It would unfortunately take too long to argue these in detail, but it is hoped that readers with more mainstream views on the passage may nevertheless find some interpretative merit in the light shed by the more unconventional presupposi tions here employed. 1. First, the question of authorship. The present writer holds the view that the apostle Paul himself wrote these verses. The passage does of course employ a good deal of formulaic and traditional language, some of which is indeed untypical of Paul. Nevertheless, after all is said and done the evidence for pre Pauline authorship in whole or in part remains specious and unconvincing. Although not impossible, an outright quotation is neither stated nor implicitly required in the context: the irregular ities of style and theology are just as readily explained by the weightiness of the subject matter and the affirmation of shared credal presuppositions. In reply to those who take a different view, we may at least plead the support of a significant minority of other recent writers who have arrived at a similar conclusion; relevant recent literature includes commentaries by Gordon Fee and Peter O'Brien as well as a monograph by Peter Wick.4 Regardless of one's views on the authorship of our passage, however, one important methodological consideration must surely govern this as all cases of possible pre-Pauline quotations: the exegete is duty bound to accept that Paul uses all his material because in his opinion it says what he wants, and that he means what he says. Modern readers of Philippians should recognize the fact that these lines form part of Paul's continuous dictation of 4 G. D. Fee, Paul's Letter to the Philippians, NICNT (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995) and P. T. O'Brien, The Epistle to the Philippians: A Commentary on the Greek Greek Text, NIGTC (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1991), ad loc.\ P.

While alert to the full potential of 'intertextuality', responsible interpretation will focus its efforts on the meaning of the text within its present context. What matters is how a text is heard by the author and by his readers—even if that may well, as undoubtedly sometimes in Paul's case, amount to two different things.6 What else it may or may not have meant in a supposedly original setting is, in strictly exegetical terms, irrelevant—just as the historical Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Isa. 8:1 ff.) could be said to have little bearing on the meaning of Isa. 7:14 in Matt. 1:23. In our case it is particularly significant that a good many verbal and conceptual links can be shown to connect the passage quite specifically with its immediately preceding (especially 2:1-4) and following (2:12 ff.) context. 2. Related to the preceding point is the question of whether vv. 6-11 are best understood as an early Christian hymn. Once again, Paul's unquestionably lyrical and liturgical language presents no intrinsic or contextual reasons for concluding that the passage must have been composed as a 'hymn', either by the Apostle himself or by anyone else. As many others have assiduously shown, these verses are characterized by an undeniable rhythm combined with typically poetic tension and repetition as well as Hebraic sounding parallelism (e.g. vv. 7b, 8b). The issue at stake, however, is whether the passage constitutes a 'hymn': and this is largely a matter of definition. A minimum criterion for the identification of such a genre might be actual liturgical use, whether in musical chant or in public credal recitation—in this case prior to the writing of Philippians. Posed in these terms, however, the question is immediately reduced to a matter of speculation. The context offers no direct or circumstantial evidence of such use; nor is the passage ever cited in this connection in any first or second century text. Paul is using Hebraically structured poetic language echoing the praise narratives of the Psalms, but we cannot say more than 5 Note G. D. Fee, Philippians, 194 n. 6. 6 That Paul was not infrequently misunderstood is well attested within the New Testament: cf. Jas. 2:14-26; 2 Pet. 3:15 f.; Acts 21:21. What Paul's Gentile readers would have made of certain Pauline midrashic techniques or assumptions about such mystical matters as 'tongues of angels' (1 Cor. 13:1) or 'the third heaven' (2 Cor. 12:2) is anyone's guess. See further M. Bockmuehl, Revelation and Mystery (Tubingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1990), 168-70, 175-77.</page><page sequence="4">4 Μ. BOCKMUEHL that.7 This poetic character can be represented in structural form,8 but this fact alone does not constitute a 'hymn'. 3. My first two presuppositions in turn imply certain conclu sions about the religious setting of Phil. 2:6-11. Many readers will be familiar with the wide range of proposed cultural back grounds for the christological ideas in this passage. This question of course becomes rather more pressing for those who suppose that the hymn is pre-Pauline, and that its original meaning and setting are vital for its interpretation. Given our limited knowledge of pre-Pauline Christianity and its doctrine(s) of Christ, this has left scholars the freedom to differ radically as to the likely back ground of the 'hymn': whether mainstream Jewish and Old Testament views of the Suffering Righteous or of Adam; whether Hellenistic Jewish Wisdom speculation, pre-Christian Hellenistic or Jewish Gnosticism, the Iranian Heavenly Redeemer myth, or several other possibilities. The various options are well covered in the secondary literature.9 7 See also G. D. Fee, 'Philippians 2:5-11: Hymn or Exalted Pauline Prose?'

Geburtstag (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 19782), 151—64 (repr. in idem, From Adam to to Christ (Cambridge: University Press, 1991), see especially 90-96). Given Paul's own native Hebrew and Aramaic background (2 Cor. 11:22; Phil. 3:5; cf. Acts 21:40; 22:3; 26:14), these and other Semitisms should not be surprising, least of all in such a lyrical and highly charged religious text as this. What the feasibility of such efforts does demonstrate is not a pre-Pauline Palestinian Christian origin (pace(pace J. A. Fitzmyer 'The Aramaic Background of Philippians 2:6-11', CBQ 50 (1988) 483), but rather that the passage is composed in language indebted to that tradition and must in the first instance be read against that formative background. 8 The outline of this passage is now generally recognized as falling into (a) verses 6-8 dealing with Christ's action of humbling himself, and (b) 9-11 with God's action of vindicating and exaltating him. Beyond that, however, conflicting detailed outlines have been proposed. For an interpretation of the passage within its present context, it will be important not to accentuate literary form at the expense of content. Thus, taking into account both considerations, we may offer a fairly basic compromise solution. (This analysis represents a modification of Hooker, Adam, 94 f., first published in 1975, who has been followed by several other commentators.)

Martin, Carmen Christi, passim.</page><page sequence="5">THE FORM OF GOD (PHIL. 2:6) 5 If, on the other hand, we are primarily interested in the meaning of the passage in its present context, the problem of ascertaining its original Sitz im Leben is immediately far less acute; if one assumes Pauline authorship, it disappears. One is then still left with the issue of the conceptual background to Paul's own thought, and perhaps to that of the Philippians. But this problem is no more serious than for any other Pauline text; the answers are likely to be commensurable, and will apply to the letter as a whole.10 A number of other preliminary issues could be addressed, such as the old crux as to whether the passage must be read in primarily ethical or primarily kerygmatic terms,11 or the question of the letter's literary integrity.12 But these and other matters can safely be left for another time, as they do not significantly affect our present purposes. 10 The Philippian situation involves a largely or exclusively Gentile congregation in a strongly pro-Imperial cultural setting, marked by a political emphasis on Roman colonial rights and responsibilities and a traditional religious loyalty to the Emperior cult. This context is particularly relevant for the theme of kenosis as well as for the assertion of Christ's lordship over all creation (2:10-11). See recently Lukas Bormann, Philippi: Stadt und Christengemeinde zur Zeit des Paulus (Leiden etc.: Brill, 1995), passim. As for Paul himself, his writings are best seen as the product of his religious and cultural formation in Palestinian and Diaspora Judaism on the one hand, and of his experience as a missionary to Gentiles on the other. 11 This is in most significant respects a false alternative. Grammatically and theologically, the most appropriate translation of verse 5 is, 'Have this attitude among you, which is also in Christ Jesus'. The moral analogy with verses 6—11 is thus retained, while acknowledging that Christ's own attitude of kenosis relates to realities that are of necessity beyond and outside time, and yet still present (1:8, 21; cf. 2:1; 3:20; also the kyyvs of 4:5). One might compare H. U. von Balthasar's point about the eternal self-emptying of the trinitarian life as manifested in the Cross (Mysterium Paschale, trans. A. Nichols (Edinburgh: Τ &amp; Τ Clark, 1990), 23-36). The kerygmatic and exemplary reality of the work of Christ embraces both past and present. The 'mindset' which Paul encourages in the Philippians 'is present' in Christ Jesus both historically and eternally. This belief could be said to follow from the continuity of the Jesus Christ of History with the Jesus Christ of Faith that is implied in the resurrection: for Paul, the one who 'was buried' (1 Cor. 15:4) is present as the one who was raised. This alone enables a present participation participation in, rather than mere remembrance of, past saving events (1 Cor. 10:16). A similar notion may be present in the Johannine notion of the scars of the risen Jesus, John 20:20-26; and of the lamb standing in heaven 'as if it had been slaughtered', Rev. 5:6; 13:8. 12 Despite striking structural and substantive aporiai in 3:1 ff. and 4:10 ff., the present writer holds to the letter's literary unity—a view which continues to be supported by scholars following a wide range of rhetorical and structural analyses of the letter. On these and other issues cf. also my forthcoming commentary on Philippians (London: A&amp;C Black, 1997).</page><page sequence="6">6 Μ. BOCKMUEHL III.III. INTERPRETATIVE CUL-DE-SACS 1. 1. The Background: Greek Mythology or Greek Old Testament? What does it mean to say that Christ 'was (lit. "existing") in the form of God', hv μορφή 9eov υπάρχων (v. 6)? From a strictly linguistic perspective, the word kv seems grammatically awkward in this connection, but should perhaps be seen as carrying a modal or circumstantial sense attested elsewhere.13 As for the term μορφή, it denotes literally the visible outward appearance of a person or object. By extension, however, the word could also come to mean the distinguishing characteristics that correspond to the visual appearance: i.e., that which gives the person identity and status. In the present context, from a literary perspective it is worth noting that 'the form of God' is complemented by 'equality (lit. "being equal") with God'; at the same time, it has its counterpart in v. 7 in the phrase 'the form of a slave' (μορφή δούλου), which in turn is further complemented by 'in human likeness'. These paral lei phrases suggest the linguistic terrain in which to understand the term 'form of God'. Among the majority of scholars there is still widespread agreement that we are dealing with Christ's state or condition in relation to God, prior to his state or condition as a servant. Beyond this, however, interpretations of the term μορφή have varied from God's 'essential attributes' to his state or mode of being, from his 'glory' to his 'image'. Lexicography is not in fact much help in this regard. In the New Testament, the word μορφή occurs only here and in the longer ending of Mark (16:12), where it describes the 'form' of the resurrection appearance on the road to Emmaus. Various conceptual backgrounds have been proposed, but no entirely obvious or satisfactory explanation has as yet emerged, in part because no fully plausible Hebraic or Hellenistic equivalent has been demonstrated. Some have maintained that the conceptual background must be sought primarily in the Hellenistic world, since a Jewish context of speaking about the 'form of God' appears to many to be theolo gically unthinkable. Martin Dibelius understood the term μορφή quite plausibly in relation to the German word Gestalt. He argued 13 Hebraic usage in analogy to ב may account for this kv, as perhaps in the Pauline phrase kv Χριστώ, whose meaning can be either modal, circumstantial, or even instrumental. See e.g. A. J. M. Wedderburn, 'Some Observations on Paul's Use of the Phrases "in Christ" and "with Christ" ', jfSNT 25 (1985) 83—97. Cf. also e.g. BDF § 198.</page><page sequence="7">THE FORM OF GOD (PHIL. 2:6) 7 that it must therefore necessarily be linked with ancient Greek mythological conceptions.14 Following Behm's learned article in the Theological Dictionary of of the New Testament, a more recent advocate of a pagan religious setting for this terminology is Ulrich B. Miiller, in his 1993 commentary and several significant earlier studies.15 His Greek references include Euripides, Bacchae 4 f.: Dionysus has changed his μορφή from a divine one to that of a man (cf. ibid. 53 f.). Similar statements can be found in relation to other gods, or indeed in relation to outstanding human beings like Pythagoras, whose biographer tells us that he was thought to be a god appearing ev ανθρωπίνγ! μορφή (Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorae 30). We may assume that this kind of religious language was relatively commonplace; similar terminology is not difficult to find in other Greek religious texts, ft later appears in a variety of expressions in magical papyri and Gnostic texts, including the Corpus Hermeticum.™Hermeticum.™ Valentinian and other forms of Gnosticism also show a distinct concern with a variety of divine morphai, 'forms', although this may well be a syncretistic development.17 Nevertheless, most of the pre-Christian Greek texts relate expli citly or at least implicitly to the classic legends of Greek mytho logy, a context without which even transferred applications like that to Pythagoras would remain meaningless. Especially given the clearly Jewish Christian tenor of our passage, a direct depend ence on this material must be deemed highly unlikely. The pagan religious use of μορφή need not illustrate the meaning of our passage any more than Plato's or Solon's use of νόμος sheds theolo gical light on the LXX translation of the word תורה. At the same time, it is of course worth recalling that early Christian and Jewish apologetic was to a large extent predicated on the criticism of precisely this sort of pagan language about God. Justin Martyr explicitly denies the pagan use of μορφή for visible representations of the gods: God does not have the sort of μορφή that some claim to have fashioned (Apol. 1.9).18 14 Μ.

BOCKMUEHL Scholars have also frequently attempted to discover a conceptual background for Paul's phrase μορφή θΐοΰ in Judaism. Most obvi ously, one has turned to the LXX. The relatively rare Septuagintal usage, however, has not proved particularly illuminating. Job's night vision in Job 4:16 suggests that μορφή is something visible to the eyes, while Isa. 44:13 makes it clear that the 'form of a man' means the physical human shape. Visible shape or appear ance is clearly also what is intended in several references in Daniel (4:36; 5:6, 9, 10; 7:28) and in the Deuterocanonical books (e.g. 4 Macc. 15:4; Wisd. 18:1; cf. Wisd. 7:10; 11:17; Sir. 9.8; 4 Macc. 8:10 ΐΰμορφος). But the term is never used of God. It has therefore become commonplace to argue that the theolo gical context of Phil. 2:6 effectively makes it the equivalent of the terms ΐΐκών and δόξα. Despite the widespread claims to this effect, however, the evidence for actual synonymy is very weak indeed. The semantic case against this was persuasively argued a few years ago by D. Steenburg;19 recent writers with similar views have included W. Pohlmann and G. D. Fee.20 There is of course admittedly a certain conceptual link in the sense that both terms designate attributes of the same object. That fact in itself, however, does not signal conflation. Corn flakes, toast, and orange juice may be discrete aspects of the same breakfast. In the same way, God's 'form' and his 'glory' are two different things; his 'form' and his 'image' are also two different things. Their conceptual proximity does not make them synonyms. Here is not the place for a detailed rehearsal of the semantic arguments, which have been well presented by Steenburg and others. Instead, we will concentrate on one particular use to which the theory of synonymy has been put: the question of Adamic imagery in Phil. 2:5—11. 2.2. Adam and the Form of God In recent years a number of scholars have seen in verses 6-8 a deliberate typological contrast between the actions of Christ and those of the biblical Adam. The argument is, roughly, that Adam was in the image of God (Gen. 1:26 f.; 5:3) and did snatch at equality with God (cf. Gen. 3:5); but where Adam was disobedient and self-seeking, Christ in the image of God was obedient and self-giving, etc. The underlying assumption here is the inter 19 19 D. Steenburg, 'The Case Against the Synonymity of morphe and eikon', JSNTJSNTJSNT 34 (1988), 77-86. 20 W. Pohlmann, "μορφή", Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament 2 (1991) 443; G. D.

On this reading, the present passage represents another instance of the well-known 'first Adam-second Adam' theme, which Paul develops clearly in Rom. 5:18-19; 1 Cor. 15:45-47 (and hints of which have been seen in other passages as well, including Col. 1:15; 1:15; 2 Cor. 4:4). Key proponents of an Adamic reading have included O. Cullmann,21 J. Murphy-O'Connor,22 M. D. Hooker23 and J. D. G. Dunn;24 the full-scale commentaries offer detailed interaction with the large volume of scholarly discussion of this matter.25 Two significant interconnected issues require attention: 1. does Paul really intend a parallel with Adam? And 2. if he does, is the parallel chiefly between Adam and the earthly Jesus? 1. Regarding the first issue, it is easy to see the intriguing potential in this text for a contrast between Christ and Adam; and interpreters have in fact suggested this connection ever since Irenaeus and Augustine. In the wider terms of Pauline theology, too, such an 'Adam versus Christ' polarity seems entirely suitable and appropriate. Nevertheless, the passage has proved remarkably resistant to any positive demonstration of verbal or other specific parallels with the text of Genesis 3. In the Genesis story, it is Eve rather than Adam who receives the proposal to be 'like God' (Gen. 3:5; LXX has 'like gods'). This 'likeness', moreover, is expressed specifically in terms of the knowledge of good and evil, which was in fact acquired (Gen. 3:22), rather than in terms of being 'equal to God'. Neither 'form' nor 'equality' are ever mentioned in the Genesis text. What is more, here in Philippians the suggested identification of 'form' with 'image' is not only lexically hard to substantiate, but must clearly appear to falter on the repetition of the same word in v. 7 ('form of a slave'): as C. A. Wanamaker shows very clearly, this reading leads to logical contradictions and destroys the deliberate syntactical and theological contrast between verses 6 and 7. The language of 'existence' (υπάρχων) in 21 Ο. Cullmann, The Christology of the New Testament, trans. S. C. Guthrie &amp; C. A. M. Hall, rev. edn. (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1963), 174-81. 22 J.

BOCKMUEHL the form of God hardly applies to Adam, and the parallel is made highly unlikely by the notion of 'taking on' the 'form of a slave'.26 2. The second question is to some extent dependent on the first, as is the urgency with which it must be asked. If there is a sense in which the human Christ undoes what Adam did, where is this act to be located? Those who affirm the Adamic scenario here vary as to whether they see (i) verse 6 taking place in heaven (the pre-existently human Second Adam) and only verses 7-8 on earth, or (ii) all of verses 6-8 predicated of the incarnate Christ. Although parallels to the former idea have been sought in 1 Cor. 15:47 and in Philo of Alexandria, an eternally pre-existent human Jesus seems difficult to establish in Paul and to square either with the assertions of v. 6 or with the implied movement to humanity in v. 7. Option (ii) has in recent times been strongly championed by J. D. G. Dunn (see n. 24), who argues that even v. 6 must be read in Adamic terms of the human Jesus, and that therefore there is no mention of pre-existence or any prior temporal reference at all: Jesus' exaltation is not his 'return' to heaven but the restoration to the 'Second Adam' of the glory which the first Adam lost. Despite attracting a good deal of interest, Dunn's interpretation has failed to win the day. It seems unable to accommodate the most likely reading of 'the form of God' and the word άρπαγμός in relation to 'equality with God'. It also, as a result, disrupts the natural flow of Christ being first in that 'form' and then 'born in human likeness' and taking the 'form of a slave' (cf. again Wanamaker). The whole language and logic of verses 6-8 suggests a movement from a divine to a human state, which Christ did not 'have' but 'took' (Λα βών).2Ί And while acknowledging that Paul was perhaps untroubled by the metaphysical intricacies of 'pre existence', we may accept with the vast majority of interpreters since antiquity that the most natural reading of this and other passages (e.g. Col. 1:15-17; 1 Cor. 8:6) will associate Christ with a time prior to Adam.28 (It is worth stressing that early Christian advocates of the Adam typology did not assert it as an alternative to a pre-existential reading of our passage). Two things may be said by way of summary of this discussion. 26 C. A. Wanamaker, 'Philippians 2.6-11: Son of God or Adamic Christology?' NTS NTS NTS NTS 33 (1987), 179-93. 27 This point has also been strongly and persuasively argued by Jiirgen Habermann, Praexistenzaussagen im Neuen Testament (Frankfurt etc.: Lang, 1990), 115 and Otfried Hofius (1991), 116-18 as well as by recent commentators including U. B. Miiller, P. T. O'Brien and G. D. Fee. 28 See further U. B. Miiller, Philipper, 96; G. D. Fee, Philippians, 203 n. 41; O. Hofius, Christushymnus, 114-22; C. A.

Secondly, however, the text nevertheless offers insufficient evidence to establish an explicit link, or even a deliberate allusion, to Adam. The only demonstrably intentional contrast is between human self-seeking (2:3-4) and Christ's self-giving (2:6); in that connection, non-explicit parallels with Adam are just as likely to be the result of accustomed ways of Pauline thinking about sinless Christ and sinful humanity. The arguments here are obviously complex and intricate, and scholarship has yet to reach a consensus on this matter. The problem is, however, that the undeniable counter-analogy between Philippians 2 and Genesis 3 in general is not easily pinned down in particulars. IV. THE'FORM׳ OF GOD: LITERAL AND MYSTICAL READINGS We return empty-handed, therefore, to our discussion of the form μορφή θΐοΰ. If it does not mean God's 'image' or 'glory', what can it mean? Since the customary scholarly constructs appear to lack persuasive force, I propose to argue that μορφή here may not not function as a technical term or abstraction substituting for something else, such as 'image', 'nature' or 'essential character istics'. Instead, we shall pursue the possibility that Paul means after all to denote quite straightforwardly the visible identifying features of a person or object. ι.ι. The 'Form of a Slave': Biblical Cue to a Concretely Visual Meaning?Meaning? A prima facie A prima facie or 'literal' reading in terms of 'visible form' would certainly produce a semantically meaningful interpretation, in keeping with the recurrence of the word μορφή in verse 7: Christ took on the 'form' of a slave—which must mean something fairly concrete, perhaps including the fact that Christ suffered the execu tion customarily meted out to rebellious slaves. This reading also finds support in several of the earliest Christian interpretations of our text. In the Ascension of Isaiah, the Lord of all the heavens transforms himself 'until he becomes like you in form and in appearance' (8:9-10; cf. 9:13); similarly, the Odes of Solomon 7.4-6 affirm that Christ became like us in appearance (demuta) and in</page><page sequence="12">12 Μ. BOCKMUEHL form (tzurta).29 In relation to the human Christ, the word 'form' was evidently understood to carry certain palpably visual connotations. One popular interpretation, developed especially by L. Cerfaux and J. Jeremias,30 has linked 2:7 more specifically with the 'Servant' of Isaiah 53. The argument here is not only that there is a general similarity between the work of the Servant and that of Christ, but that the words 'slave', 'emptying', and 'death' (v. 8) are deliberately reminiscent of Isa. 53:12: he 'poured himself out to death'. If a plausible link with the term μορφή could be estab lished, the stress on the Servant's 'appearance' in Isa. 53:2 and passim passim might become significant. However, there are of course a number of well-known problems with this reading. The LXX in Isa. 53:12 does not in fact use the word 'empty' or the word 'slave' (but rather παις, 'servant' or 'son'); what is more, a precise reference to Isa. 53:12 at this point would introduce a structurally awkward and implausible reference to Christ's death (vv. 7a, b) preceding his incarnation (7c, d) and a further reference to the cross (8b, c). The LXX does not use the word μορφή. Nevertheless, others have brought intriguing additional evid ence to bear. Contrary to the assertions of some,31 δούλος is in fact used interchangeably of the Servant in a number of passages (e.g. Isa. 42:19; 48:20; 49:3, 5). It is also found consistently in the important early second-century translation of Aquila, who more over does speak of the 'form' (μορφή) of this 'slave' in 52:14 and 53:2. Given Paul's choice of language, this latter piece of evidence is particularly suggestive of a possible link with the Jewish inter pretative traditions surrounding Isaiah 53. In the end, a literary dependence of this passage on the LXX of Isaiah 53 clearly cannot be demonstrated (so rightly Hooker and Hofius).32 Nor is it structurally likely that v. 7 intends a precise reference to Isa. 53:12. Nevertheless, the general point remains well taken, and is supported by the evidence of other ancient versions: the self-effacing humility of Jesus taking the 'form of a slave' and accepting death is described in language 29 Christian interpolations in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs take a similar line: in the Testament of Benjamin 10:7 the king of heaven 'appeared on earth in the μορφή of a humble man' (cf. Test. Zab. 9:8: 'the Lord in human σχήμα). 30 E.g. L. Cerfaux, Christ in the Theology of St. Paul (London: Chapman, 1959), 377-82; J. Jeremias, 'Zu Phil, ii 7: ΕΑΥΤΟΝ ΕΚΕΝΩΣΕΝ, Novum Testamentum 6 (1963), 182-88. 31 E.g. Κ. H.

Isa. 53:5-6, 10-12). 2.2. Anthropomorphism and the Visibility of God Regardless of the possible link with Isaiah 53, to interpret μορφή in verse 6 in the light of its evidently more concrete meaning in verse 7 might at first sight seem straightforward. Biblical scholar ship, however, has in the past resisted talk about God's visual form almost instinctively, on the assumption that it is incom patible with the strict Jewish and Christian prohibitions of three dimensional conceptions of God. Does Paul's Jewish background offer any hints as to how one might be able to speak more directly about God's visible outward form? Before we can proceed very far in this direction, it is worth reminding ourselves briefly of the Old Testament's fierce resist ance to any human visual representations of God. This is the case in the interpolations of Exod. 20:4 and 33:20 ('no one shall see me and live'), and then especially in Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic history. One of the clearest and most important is Deut. 4:12, 'Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice'. This theme that 'no one has ever seen God' is widely picked up in post-biblical Jewish literature and in the New Testament (John 1:18; cf. Rom. 1:20; Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17). Its SitzSitz im Leben is frequently in anti-Gentile polemic: unlike the pagan idols, the Hebrew God is above and beyond any visual representation. At the same time, however, the Old Testament also shows 33 One additional possibility worth pondering is that this indirect hermeneutical underpinning of our passage may be further enhanced by a christological reading of Psalm 8. This approach, already facilitated by the LXX superscript 'for the End' (els το tc'Aos, 8.1), is explicitly attested in Heb. 2:6-9 (but cf. also 1 Cor. 15:27; Eph. 1:22): Christ the 'human being' and 'son of man' was made 'for a little while' lower than the angels (Hebr. 'God'), but because of his suffering and death he has now been 'crowned with glory and honour', and God has 'put all things under his feet'. The Psalm begins with an emphasis on the 'name' of the 'Lord' (κύριο?) as being wondrous in all the earth (8:2, 10); his majesty 'has been exalted above the heavens' (LXX v. 2). For the christological implications of the Septuagintal Psalms see also Richard B. Hays, 'Christ Prays the Psalms: Paul's Use of an Early Christian Exegetical Convention', in A. J. Malherbe and W. A. Meeks (eds.), The Future of Christology: Essays in Honor of Leander E. Keck (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1993), 122-36 (cf. p. 127 on el? τό τύλο?).</page><page sequence="14">14 Μ. BOCKMUEHL evidence of a persistent contrary tradition. The Lord God walks in the garden in the cool of the evening (Gen. 3:8); he meets with Abraham (Genesis 18, esp. v. 13 ff.); the seventy Elders ascend Mount Sinai to see him and eat and drink in his presence (Exod. 24. 10 f.). This has often been regarded as indicative of a primitive anthropomorphism later abandoned in the course of increasing religious sophistication. Visions of God (or of his throne, heaven, etc.) extend in fact from the earliest to the latest traditions in the Old Testament: from Jacob's Ladder in Genesis 28 or the hem of the Lord's robe filling the Temple in Isaiah 6 all the way to Ezekiel's vision of the throne chariot (Ezekiel 1) or Daniel's daring vision of the Ancient of Days (Daniel 7).34 Indeed it is worth remembering that the great mystical passages in the Bible and in later Judaism are almost exclusively visual in character. Gershom Scholem and students of apocalyptic after him have frequently argued for a continuity of mystical tradition from the throne visions of the Old Testament and of 1 Enoch 14.18-24 (cf. e.g. Life of Adam and Eve Eve 25:3) to those of later apocalyptic and rabbinic Judaism.35 And even if we must now reject Scholem's argument for the early date of many texts of merkabah mysticism,36 the heavenly liturgies contained in Qumran's Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice now seem to confirm his instincts about a basic continuum of tradition from the earlier to the later visions of God's celestial glory. At least for internal Jewish consumption, therefore, it was clearly possible to continue to use strikingly concrete imagery to approximate a description of what the ineffable God was like. Given an unques tioned consensus about God's personal inaccessibility to sight and reason, in a visionary context the anthropomorphic imagery of the Bible could come to be treated as a precedent for remarkably playful and daring theological exploration of him who, by defini tion, remains hidden from human view. 34 Note J.

Does God Have a 'Form'? But do Jewish writers in fact ever use the word μορφή of God? A few examples suggest that the answer is Yes. Josephus writes in Contra Apionem 2:190 that God's μορφή and greatness (μέγεθος) are hidden: he clearly has a μορφή but it is not accessible to humans. Philo of Alexandria is also worth consulting on this matter. By and large he uses the word μορφή in its ordinary literal sense, without applying it directly to God: examples include the Creator's shaping clay into human form (Migr. 3), or creating the woman in a form like that of man (Opif. 151).37 His treatment of one biblical passage, however, opens up an intriguing possibility which has not been widely explored. In his Life of Moses 1.66, Philo describes how Moses approached the burning bush (Exodus 3) and saw in the midst of the flame a most beautiful form (μορφή), not like any visible object, an image supremely divine in appearance (θεοεώέστατον άγαλμα), shining with a light more brilliant than that of fire. One might suppose this to be the image of Him Who Is (εικόνα τοΰ ovtos); but let us rather call it an angel. Philo clearly goes beyond the LXX in suggesting that what Moses saw in the bush was something which, although on balance best regarded as an angel, nevertheless manifested a visible 'form' which in every significant respect could easily be taken to be that of God. One senses that Philo remains somewhat tentative, due partly to the ambiguities of the Exodus text and partly to his desire to safeguard the transcendence of God's 'form'. In any case he does not explore the word μορφή along these lines elsewhere, although he does allow that God appears from time to time as an angel (Somn. 1.232). Nevertheless, this passage does suggest that talk of God's 'form' could belong to the context of Jewish mystical thought about the ascent to behold the heavenly appearance of God—a tradition with which Paul may well have been familiar,38 and whose relevance Otfried Hofius has demonstrated in relation to Phil. 2:9.39 37 Sibylline Oracles 8.440 similarly asserts that man was created in God's μορφή. 38 See e.g. C. R. A. Morray-Jones, 'Paradise Revisited (2 Cor. 12:1-12): The Jewish Mystical Background of Paul's Apostolate', IITR 86 (1993), 177-217, 265—92; and more recently J. M.

BOCKMUEHL Philo's language about God's μορφή is paralleled in a few other Hellenistic Jewish and early Jewish Christian texts. But before we turn to these, it is worth considering a group of Palestinian Jewish texts from the first century bc found at Qumran and known as the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice. This material shows a sus tained interest in the worship offered by heavenly beings in the immediate presence of God. Here, reference is made, for instance, to (i) the 'form' (תבנית) of the divine throne chariot (4Q405 20.ii.8); (ii) the glorious 'form' (תבנית) of the leaders in the realm of spirits (4Q403 i.ii.3); (iii) the blessing offered to the captains of 'the form of God' (תבנית אלהים: possibly 'the form of divine beings', 4Q403 1 .ii. 16); as well as to 'every form (תבנית) of won drous spirits' (1 iQSirSabb 5-6.2), who again are closely associated with אלהים, i.e. 'God' or 'divine beings'. Rather like μορφή, the word תבנית refers most typically to the visible, three-dimensional shape or design of an object; LXX Is. 44:13 in fact translates תבנית as μορφή. The Old Testament repeat edly uses this variously translated Hebrew word in relation to heavenly realities; one of the most significant passages is Exod. 25:9, 40 in relation to the form of the Tabernacle and its furnish ings which God showed to Moses on Mt. Sinai. Another important passage in rabbinic mysticism is Ezek. 8:2-3: I looked, and there was a figure (ΓΠΰ"Τ) that looked like a human being; below what appeared to be its loins it was fire, and above the loins it was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming amber (חשמל!, it stretched out the form (תבנית) of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem.... While my argument here is based on the Hebrew rather than the LXX terminology, it is particularly interesting to note that both these passages feature in numerous mystical texts from the rabbinic period, both in midrash and in hekhalot literature. And the argument of Hebrews 8 actually depends for its validity on the assumption that the word תבנית (LXX τύπος) in Exodus 25:40 must denote not a notional 'pattern' so much as the three dimensional 'real thing', the visible heavenly reality of which the earthly tabernacle is but a faint shadow and copy (Heb. 8:5). A much cited passage in the Talmud intimates the relationship of 'form' to 'image' by saying that man's being made 'in the image (צלם) of God' means 'in the image (צלם) of the likeness (למות) of his form (תבנית)' (b.Ket 8a); his 'form' according to this text remains at one remove from his image. This confirms the balance of Scripture, where human beings are in God's צלם and in his למות; both of these terms can mean either an image or likeness</page><page sequence="17">THE THE FORM OF GOD (PHIL. 2:6) 17 in either two or three dimensions. But humanity is never said to be in God's תבנית—or, in the LXX, in his μορφή. 4.4. The Form of God and the Body of God Interest in the form of God and other heavenly beings carries on from apocalyptic to later mystical texts. On the Jewish side, we find even in Tannaitic midrashim an increasing interest in the anthropomorphic 'measures' (middot) and dimensions of God, to which Michael Fishbane has recently drawn attention.40 He high lights the use of concepts of God's 'measure' or 'form' in Tannaitic midrashim, and he points out the relevance of this to Ephesians with its discussion of the heavenly body of Christ and to 'measure (μετρον) of the full stature of Christ' (4:13, 15 f.). The heavenly body also features in the Jewish apocalypse known as 2 Enoch, which from a somewhat different perspective shows a similar fascination with God's visible appearance. Contrasting his own human mouth, hand, face, and eyes with those of the Lord who has spoken to him, Enoch goes on to comment on the Lord's body: '...But I have seen the Lord's right hand motioning to me and filling the heaven. You see how large my body is, that it is just like yours; but I have seen how great the Lord is, that he is immeasurable, incomparable, and has no end' (13:3-10). In the course of the Tannaitic, Talmudic, and post-Talmudic periods, this mystical interest in the heavenly body of God develops into the so-called Shi'ur Qomah speculation with its burning desire to see and describe the dimensions of what God 'looks like'. Peter Schafer writes, The decisive statement of Shi'ur Qomah is that God does, on the one hand, look like a human being; but, on the other hand, he exceeds all human measurements. God's hidden being expresses itself in dimensions that surpass all human categories and, paradoxically, is conceivable in its imperceptibility.41 What is more, several of the later hekhalot texts and minor midra shim continue to describe the heavenly realities in the terminology 40 Μ.

BOCKMUEHL we found in Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, referring to the תבנית of the heavenly beings.42 On both the Jewish and the Christian side, this concern with the divine body was explicitly fuelled by biblical antecedents. References in the Torah, Isaiah, and Psalms to God's greatness (גדלה) are favourite citations in the Shi'ur Qomah texts;43 and Origen tells us that some (Jews?) use Isa. 66:1 to imply that God is so large that he can sit in heaven and use the earth as his footstool.44 The second-century Christian writer Melito of Sardis, too, reputedly wrote a book about the physical nature of God (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 4:26). Beyond that, however, a significant point of reference since at least Tannaitic times appears to have been in the description of the body of the Beloved in the Song of Songs (especially 5:10-16). According to Origen, it may well have been for this reason that certain rabbis insisted on keeping secret their interpretation of the Song of Songs.45 The Targum and the Midrash on the Song of Songs similarly are concerned with a typological reading, and the same approach is followed by the seventh-century liturgical poet Kalir.46 Such an allegorical reading of the Song of Songs is of course by no means a late invention. The possibility of a theological reading of the Song of Songs is perhaps already opened up in the oblique opening reference to the Beloved in 1:2, and in the fam ously disputed term שלהבתיה in Cant. 8.6: the bride says to the groom, 'Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a flame of YAH'. Similarly, divine 42 E.g. Alphabet of ben Sira 43:5 (1); Masekhet Hekhalot 108 תבנית פנס; cf.

Elsewhere in the Old Testament, the paradigm of romantic love as representing the relationship between God and Israel is of course well-established, not least in Hosea and especially in Ezekiel 16. The Targums and Jewish traditions on the Song of Songs from at least the Tannaitic period also clearly take the line that the Lover is none other than God.47 What is more, Tannaitic discussions imply that the Song of Songs would not be in the Bible if it had not been read in a spiritual sense: in reply to the question of its legitimacy, Rabbi Aqiba affirmed, 'All the ages are not worth the day on which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies'.48 This was said to be the Song which Israel sang to the Lord at the Red Sea. Tannaitic texts also show themselves offended at secular or jesting uses of the Song in their own day.49 The same view in a Christian guise is of course famously repres ented in Origen's commentary, which shows itself aware of con temporary Jewish interpretations. His contemporary Hippolytus followed the same approach in his own commentary; even the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies speak of the angels beholding the limbs and the form (μορφή) of God for their beauty alone: 'He has the most beautiful shape on account of man, that the pure in heart may be able to see Him, that they may rejoice because they suffered' (Ps.-Clem. Horn. 17:7). CONCLUSION: THE FORM OF GOD IN PHILIPPIANSPHILIPPIANS 2:6 But what does all this have to do with Philippians 2? I would like to suggest that Paul stands in a similar Jewish mystical tradi tion in which it was possible to speak of the Lord's majesty and greatness by alluding to the inconceivable size and beauty of his bodily appearance. Several considerations point to this. First, Paul himself stands in the visionary tradition of his ancestors, even if this takes for him a christological focus where in a Jewish context 47 Cf. Η. Gollancz, 'The Targum to the "Song of Songs"in B. Grossfeld, The The The Targum to the Five Megilloth (New York 1973); P. S. Alexander, 'Jewish Aramaic Translations of Hebrew Scriptures', in M. J.

BOCKMUEHL the focus might have been on God himself, or mediator figures like Yahoel or Metatron. As such he can ask, quite deliberately, 'Have I not seen the Lord?' (1 Cor. 9:1); he admits to having had powerful visions and revelations of the Lord (2 Cor. 12:1 ff.), a claim which would appear to be confirmed in Acts (9; 22; 26). The impact of Paul's visionary experience of the risen Christ on his theology must not be underrated, as passages like Gal. 1:12, 16 and 2 Cor. 4:6 suggest very strongly.50 In all these cases, the implied christology necessarily places such visions of the heavenly Christ in close proximity to the traditions about visions of God. Secondly, here in Phil. 2:6—11 it is worth noting how the mys tical theme of God's form is combined with that of his name above all other names. The same is true for many of the Jewish mystical texts we have discussed. We know from 4QSirSabb and other Dead Sea documents that the Essenes had an intense interest in the glorious and transcendent names of the heavenly beings (note also Josephus, War 2.142). Philo of Alexandria called the Logos, God's firstborn son, an archangel 'of many names', one of which is 'name of God' (Conf. 146). It is quite plausible, therefore, that at least in Jewish and Jewish Christian circles Paul's reference to the 'name above every name' would have been well known and understood, as Otfried Hofius has also pointed out.51 Thirdly, Philippians offers additional evidence of interest in the divine body. Paul refers in 3:21 to the heavenly body of the Lord's glory, into which our bodies of humiliation will be transformed. This is an idea which points very much to Paul's concern with the Lord's heavenly body as relevant not merely to Christ's pre incarnate state, but also as that which holds the key to the future existence of Christians (cf. e.g. 1 Cor. 15:20, 48—49 and passim). The connections of this notion with Jewish mysticism have been pointed out in an important study by Guy Stroumsa.52 Paul's statement about this heavenly body of the Lord should be seen as linked with passages like Col. 3:3 about Christians' life being hidden with Christ in God. Fishbane's interest in Ephesians also seems highly relevant in this context, whatever that letter's precise connection with the Apostle himself: in particular, it is worth 50 Cf. S. Kim, The Origin of Paul's Gospel (Tilbingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1981), 99 and passim. 51 Cf. O. Hofius, Christushymnus, 27 f., 109, who also notes later Gnostic interest in the same subject. Gnostic use of Phil. 2:6-11 is frequently attested by the Church Fathers, e.g. Hippolytus, Ref. 5:19.21; Clem. Alex., Excerpta ex Theodoto 35:1; 43:4■ 52 G. G.

In the logic of Ephesians, this interest in the heavenly body is theologically justified on the basis of the ascension into heaven of him who was raised from the dead and sat down at the right hand of God (1:20). Or in terms of Philippians 2: Paul commends the attitude 'which is also in Christ Jesus' (ο και kv Χριστώ Χριστώ Ιησού): the one who was in heavenly form is the same one who took the form of a slave; and this in turn is the same one who is now Lord of all.53 It is theologically incorrect, therefore, to assume that the form of God is constituted by the earthly appearance of the incarnate Jesus, as though the 'form of God' were somehow directly identical with the 'form of a slave'. This mistake continues to be encoun tered even among systematic theologians.54 The form of God pertains to the beauty of his eternal heavenly appearance, which is expressed in the eternally present but historically realised act of taking on 'the form of a slave'. The earthly 'mind' and mission of Christ, in other words, is the translation into time, space, and creation of the eternal heavenly form of God.55 The difference between the pre-existent divine form of Christ in Phil. 2:6 and his ascended body in 3:21 lies precisely in the unequal beginning and ending of the divine 'U-Turn' in 2:6-11: the humiliation and exaltation of Christ is the realisation of a potential, the bringing to expression of what divinity means. Thus, to follow a suggestion made by C. F. D. Moule and others, the participle in verse 6a should be read not 'though' (pace many translations) but 'since he was in the form of God'.56 The difference between the 53 The relationship between the pre-incarnate and the exalted body is never properly explored in the New Testament, although the fact of personal identity and continuity is strongly intimated (cf. e.g. John 16:28; 17:8, 11; Rev. 5:6; 13:8). 54 So e.g. Trevor Williams, Form and Vitality in the World and in God (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985), 211—19. 55 Cf. Hans Urs von Balthasar, The Glory of the Lord, vol. 1: Seeing the Form (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1982), 328-31; idem, A Theology of History (London: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1964), 26-28; cf. Francesca Aran Murphy, Christ the Form of Beauty:Beauty: A Study in Theology and Literature (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1995), 136 ff. 56 Although the grammatical form is necessarily tenuous and one must be careful not to overstate the case, there is in fact a rich tradition of Jewish interpretation according to which God personally identifies with the suffering and affliction of his people. Even the biblical precedent is suggestive: He 'knows and sees' their slavery, and 'comes down' to deliver them personally (Exod. 3.7 f.); he places his dwelling in their midst and walks among them (Lev. 26:11 f.; cf. 16:16). The Qere' reading of Isa. 63:9 is particularly evocative: 'He was afflicted in all their affliction', a notion richly developed in rabbinic Judaism (e.g. Mek.de-R. Ishmael Bahodesh 1, ed. Lauterbach p. 197). Cf. e.g. K. G. Kuhn, Gottes Selbsterniedrigung in der Theologie der Rabbinen (Munich: K5sel, 1968) for the theme of God's self</page><page sequence="22">22 Μ. BOCKMUEHL pre-incarnate and the ascended Christ is the bestowing of the name above every name and of universal worship (vv. io-i 1), the declaration of sonship with power (Rom. 1:4)—or indeed what Irenaeus later called the anakephalaiosis. Finally, in an admittedly speculative vein, I would like to sug gest that Paul himself may well have been aware of the mystical interpretation of the Song of Songs. This would affect Philippians only in a tangential way, but it could help us to understand the wider context in which his thought is presented. The typological interpretation of the Song of Songs appears to go back at least to the first century, as the rabbinic and early Patristic evidence suggests;57 it may also be attested in what has been tenuously identified as a commentary at Qumran (4Q240, still unpublished). New Testament hints at such an interpretation include Rev. 3:20, 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock', and perhaps 19:7 about the marriage of the lamb (cf. Cant. 5.2; see also John 7:38 with Cant. 4.15). Having already cited Ephesians, it may be permissible to suggest that the wider Pauline corpus itself offers a passage which may be conditioned by a similar approach to the Song of Songs. Eph. 5:25-33 speaks of human marriage as patterned after the Lord's relationship with his people, to which even Gen. 2:24 is applied: Christ, too, has left his father and mother and been joined to his wife, and the two have become one. Given the early date of the allegorical reading of the Song of Songs, and its links with the ancient prophetic theme of God's love relationship with Israel (e.g. Hosea 1-2; Jeremiah 3; Ezekiel 16), this passage in Ephesians is inevitably replete with powerful symbolic resonances. If the writer did not have the Song of Songs at the back of his mind, the least we can say is that he left the door wide open for Christian interpreters to draw this connection. Origen, Ambrose, and Gregory of Nyssa did this, and later writers followed them. Since we are already somewhat in the realm of theological speculation, it may be appropriate to conclude on this note and to add a brief reference to Wirkungsgeschichte, as illustrating the effect which a 'spiritual' reading of Paul's phrase in Phil. 2:6 had on the theology of one of his better known readers. That a connec tion with the Song of Songs was overtly in Paul's mind must of course remain doubtful. It was, however, explicitly in the mind of one of his most famous mystical interpreters, for whom Phil. humbling; a related development is present in the theology of 'glory' in the Fourth Gospel. On this reading, therefore, it is precisely in God's character to humble himself and to minister to his people for their redemption. (Cf. O'Brien, Philippians,Philippians,Philippians, 214-16.) 57 Cf. e.g. R. Beckwith, 'Formation of the Hebrew Bible', 71 f.</page><page sequence="23">THE FORM OF GOD (PHIL. 2:6) 23 2:6-7 was a pivotal text cited over twenty-five times in his sermons on the Song of Songs. St Bernard of Clairvaux uses the paradigm of the 'form of God' taking on the 'form of a slave' to illustrate a Christ-like re-ordering of human love, from concupiscence to charity. He writes, How beautiful you appear to the angels, Lord Jesus, in the form of God, eternal, begotten before the daystar amid the splendours of heaven, the radiant light of God's glory and the perfect copy of his nature, the unchanging and untarnished brightness of eternal life! How beautiful you are to me, my Lord, even in the very discarding of your beauty! When you divested yourself of the native radiance of the unfailing light, then your kindness was thrown into relief, your love shone out more brightly...58 St Bernard's exegesis throws into striking relief the meaning of the phrase μορφή θΐοΰ which this essay has advocated: it refers in Phil. 2:6 to the visible divine beauty and appearance which Christ had in his pre-incarnate state, before taking on the visible form and appearance of a slave.
